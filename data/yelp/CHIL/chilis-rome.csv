Ann K.,"Jefferson County, KY",5,32,7,5.0,9/4/2010,"Great food here! I'm a vegetarian, so I get the black bean burger w/ Avacado slices! Yumm to the EEE! Great drinks too! Say Hi to Sharon or Perry behind the bar! They do have call ahead seating, which cuts down on the wait considerably.. The kids always like it and so does MOM!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rome?start=20
Kristen I.,"Cumming, GA",36,1,,3.0,11/15/2017,"I have ordered take out from this locations twice and both times they have messed it up. Be warned - double check your order before you leave. Once there was no dessert and to fix it they wouldn't refund, they just offered a gift card I had to pick up. Second time was no chicken on my Quesadilla Explosion Salad. Super annoying. Their chicken enchilada soup is still tasty though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rome
Rj B.,"Dalton, GA",125,524,456,2.0,8/12/2016,"This place should be avoided. Hopefully our girl was having a bad day. It took us over 30 minutes just to get drinks. We ordered them, but they didn't come. We had to ask someone else for our drinks. They went and got them in no time.  I quit paying attention to how long before our food came out, but it was a long wait. It was just under 1 1/2 hours from beginning to end for LUNCH. I don't have that kind of time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rome
Jill E.,"Titusville, FL",34,1,,5.0,7/26/2017,I came for lunch and order the sirloin steak with shrimp mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was simply amazing! The server was very nice and welcoming! I'm in and out of Rome Georgia at least every other month and I will definitely put this one on my list to come back to!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rome
Misty C.,"Silver Creek, GA",0,11,,5.0,10/12/2017,I have been a regular for the past 18 years and by far it is one of my favorites.  The food is always consistent and the service is wonderful,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rome

M S.,"Moulton, AL",1,76,53,1.0,6/2/2016,"I came in at 4:15 and promptly sat down at the bar section in a booth. I did not get an acknowledgement of my arrival until the bar maid behind the bar said that she will be with me in a minute and that was 5 minutes after I was sitting there without even a menu. She was too busy gossiping with one of the guys sitting at the bar. I ordered an El  Presidente margarita which had the minimum amount of liquor in it and the three tacos...prime rib, shrimp and fish. The fish tasted old and I only took a bite... Subpar food with subpar service.  While eating my tacos I watched a family of 5 stand at the hostess stand for four minutes before anybody came out to see them and there was hardly anybody in the restaurant because it was only 4:35. I could tell that they were getting upset because there was not a Hostess there to greet them and see them in a timely manner ... they almost left . I cannot believe the lack of customer service and less than mediocre food at this establishment. I am surprised that this Chili's is still in business. I definitely will not be coming back to this Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rome
Alan S.,"Rome, GA",0,50,10,2.0,7/5/2016,"I just can't like this. It is just kid food.  Service okay, but bar is uncomfortable when trying to sit and speak with a small group.   Not a real fan.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rome
Bill M.,"Cornelius, NC",0,3,,1.0,9/6/2016,"I travel weekly for business and over the years (like 18) I have seen a lot of restaurants but this one is a pretty bad. Went here for on 9/1/2016 at the request of a customer who I was taking to lunch. We were early (around 11:15) so there weren't many people there at the moment. While the food and service were on par with what I would expect, this place got REALLY low marks for cleanliness. We were seated in the bar area (on the left) and the right side of the restaurant was separated by a glass wall. At some point, I had to walk through the right side of the place to get to the men's room. That area smelled like a garbage dumpster and the oder hit me  like a brick wall. I also noticed that the same area was a bit gross, floor was poorly (if at all) mopped, kind of greasy and the bus boys station was really unkept and grimy as well. The smell however was really over powering. Once the lunch crowd started rolling in they actually started seating people in that half which was the other thing I found hard to believe. If my customer had not suggested we go there, I would have returned to my seat and told the waiter I was leaving because of the really bad environment. I am big believer that if the FRONT end of a restaurant (where you sit and eat) if dirty, the back end where your food is made is probably 10 times worse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rome
Eddie E.,"Jennings, FL",0,70,6,3.0,10/8/2015,"Nothing says ""I love you"" like bowling and dinner at Chilis.

Susan R.,"Rome, GA",62,58,55,4.0,1/17/2016,"Met 12 friends today at Chili's. They had no problem getting a large table set up (we arrived right at noon, right before their rush)  Our waiter was very attentive to us, my glass never emptied. Ordered the fried pickles appetizer... They were ok. I've had better, but I've also had worse..  I then ordered the Sweet and Smoky cheeseburger, well done. I usually order a well done burger in unfamiliar places- it's one of those hard to screw up items. My burger was good:nice bun, crispy edges on the patty, fresh produce. Good sized burger, I cut it in half-easier to handle that way. Came with a small dish of bizarre pickle chips. Lots of fresh dill and garlic on them. They were ok. The fries were crispy and good, but the portion was somewhat  small. A half dozen or so more would have been nice. Hubby ordered fajitas. Portion size was adequate and it came with a dish of the normal add ons, but there were very few peppers in the iron dish. There was plenty of scorched onion, however. We smelled the scorched onion as the server (not our waiter, but a woman we hadn't interacted with, which seemed weird) approached our table in fact... Hubs looked wistfully at my burger and said he wished he'd ordered one like mine... By the time our group had finished our main courses, there was a crowd waiting inside and outside for tables, so we ordered our desserts to go as a courtesy to others. We got a large portion of decent cheesecake. We left out waiter a decent tip... He was very personable and tried his best, he couldn't help the pepper-skimpy fajitas or the scorched onion. The parking lot here is actually adequate for those of us who drive a vehicle larger than A subcompact unlike many newer parking lots. All in all, my meal was good. I would advise anyone considering giving them a try to stick to the burgers. Bon appetite!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rome
Lou G.,"Alpharetta, GA",723,644,623,2.0,7/24/2014,"Definitely some service issues here. Appetizer came out with entrees etc But the beer was two for one, so that gets a star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rome
Frank B.,"Cave Spring, GA",5,131,67,3.0,8/29/2014,"Baby back, baby back, take these baby back ribs back please.  I ordered the dry rub baby back ribs, Caesar salad, and water. The lettuce was wilted, dressing was bland. The ribs were over cooked, dry, and not tasty.  The water was wet and yummy. Plus one star for the step stool in the restroom for young kids.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rome
Wendell B.,"Rome, GA",103,296,2,4.0,7/2/2015,"Hadn't been here in a while, and since it's summer, it was time for a margarita!  We started with the onion rings coated with panko break crumbs, and my wife ordered her on the rocks and as usual I had mine frozen.  Darn!  They were two for one so we had to drink two!  For dinner she sensibly ordered the turkey burger with no bun and a side of broccoli.  Less sensibly, I ordered the Southern smokehouse bacon burger with cheese, with a side of their great corn on the cob.  Both were first rate and Renee took especially good care of us.  We got a little tired of coming here after a few years but now that we have much more choices in Rome, we enjoy coming here every few months or so.  Always a delicious choice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rome
Benny G.,"Calhoun, GA",0,13,,4.0,8/15/2015,"If Outback is too busy, I occasionally come in for my lunch break. Servers are very friendly and make sure that you are taken care of without bothering you. However deducting one star due to the way that the to-go phone is often answered.

Bob L.,"Greensboro, NC",10,58,25,4.0,1/3/2015,"Most of my visits come on Sundays because they are the only place in town that shows EVERY NFL game (Go Rams!).

Anthony L.,"Cedartown, GA",1,9,,2.0,9/3/2012,"Since this is a chain restaurant I will direct this review mostly to elements specific to this location in Rome, GA.  The main issue? The staff both on the waiting side and in the kitchen seem to have no firm management. This causes bad experiences to the norm and when you do get good service from start to finish it is an amazement over something that should be standard.  I have been seated and never waited on for 30 minutes, every single time I order the philly steak appetizer (even when it was the newest promotion they were advertising) they always had a problem with it usually involving the cheese sauce that comes with it that always was overcooked, clumpy, had a weird taste, etc. I have been served cold food, the list goes on. Having a mixup in a chain restaurant is fairly normal, but when it is hard to pick out the decent trips you've had it is a problem and from the experiences again I think it all links back to the employees just not having to care too much which is a management issue. I applaud the employees that caused some of my good experiences like a waitress one time that noticed my wife's food was prepared poorly and she proactively fixed it for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rome
Jeff H.,"LaFayette, GA",1,5,,1.0,11/5/2015,Walked right in no wait. I waited six minutes at the table and not a single server stopped to get my drink order or even said hi.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rome
Loretta C.,"Rome, GA",7,31,15,5.0,8/21/2014,"This is one of my favorite restaurants.  Why it's listed as pizza I'm not sure.  I'm giving it five stars because I've been going for years and never had a bad experience.  The worst thing that's ever happened is having to wait when it's crowded, at lunch or on weekend evenings, but that's at a lot of good restaurants.  The service has been very good my last few visits.  I tried the new carnita fajitas at lunch recently and I am still bragging about what a great dish that is.  Chili's is one of the best restaurants in our little town and we have many, many, many eating places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rome
Howard L.,"Rome, GA",3,26,14,1.0,9/30/2013,"I haven't been to this Chili's in Rome for a while because the last time I went the service was terrible.  Today I decided to give Chili's another try and again the service was bad.  Food was good except for my daughter's hamburger which was dry.  They had two waiters servicing our area and the service started off okay, but after we got our food, no one came back to check on us.  I finally had to flag someone down to get some condiments for my daughter's burger and it took them 10 minutes to get them.   Of course the burger was cold at this point but we were in a hurry so I didn't complain.  I asked for the check and it took the waiter 5 minutes to get me that.  What the hell?  I will definitely not be going back there.  There too many other good restaurants with great service to go to in Rome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rome
