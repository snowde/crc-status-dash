Jeffndonna M.,"Inwood, Houston, TX",17,65,11,3.0,12/28/2017,Food was ok for a chilis. Im sure alomst everyone has been to a Chilis but this one is not impressive. Waiter was reall cool which is why im giving three stars but everything else was blahhh.. 1) Slow night and no hostess. Sign was up to wait to be seated yet nobody around for 7 minutes. Almost left 2) Drinks took 10 minutes to get to us. Wife ordered a mix drink and I ordered a Martini which had no alcohol. Told the waiter to take it back because I was not impressed. 3) Food was ok but seemed bland.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg
Cat W.,"Katy, TX",66,158,178,1.0,10/29/2017,"If I could leave zero stars I absolutely would. The worst service I've ever had anywhere, ever.  Sat with empty drinks for 20 mins, watched our beers sit at the bar for 15 mins before I got the hostess to get them for us. Table never cleared, not checked on one single time. Literally. The only time we got anything is when one of us got up to get help.  After waiting 40 mins for our check ( one friend was paying cash) one of our friends asked for the manager and they flat out refused to go get him. What now? Then said the bad service was because our server had another table that was bigger. Ummm negative all this started long before you sat him a huge party.  Hostess brings our check and gets huffy when I tell her we are trying to split it. Then says "" only 2 of you drank 5 beers???"" Well yeah, not hard to do when you are in a Chilis for over TWO HOURS because you can't seem to get out of there. Also none of your business what your guests are drinking or how much, a beer an hour is completely normal.  I have never been so pissed off. Oh and to top it all off when my friend wanted to pay their check in cash NO ONE ever came back. He sees the manager and while having him cash him out he says what our experience was and the manager says "" he has a large table, sorry about that"" ARE YOU SERIOUS? If I hadn't been here I wouldn't believe it, no one gave any effs about us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg
Cindy S.,"Houston, TX",0,29,,1.0,9/13/2017,"This was one of the most pathetic lunches I have ever had. My friend and I were catching up, so waiting an hour for our order we were chatting. But salad was terrible. The lettuce tasted like the smell of a sour refrigerator and the quesadea were cold and greasy. The waiter and waitress could not co ordinate anything. Took 15 minutes to get the bill. Just dreadful. Avoid the place if possible!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg
Kristy S.,"Sugar Land, TX",81,400,758,2.0,4/14/2017,"I ordered to go. Food was cold. After reheating it, taste was it was fine. Service was good, no complaints. Place is always dead when I come by for dinner. We've dine it before and service was great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg
Corinne F.,"Sugar Land, TX",26,297,217,5.0,8/11/2017,Excellent friendly and attentive service by our waiter Dennis. The food was pretty doggone tasty. But I also need to mention the rockin music.

Aisha M.,"Richmond, TX",107,124,129,4.0,6/28/2017,We came in today with about 50 children from camp and the staff handle our group very well. They did a good job of taking orders and the food came out right on time. We appreciate their hard work!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg

Parveen B.,"Houston, TX",0,4,2,1.0,1/7/2017,"Been here couple of times. Both for take out and dine in.  Dine service is spotty. Service can be better. Once waited an hour for food. The manager did come by to let us know there was an issue with our food. Which was odd since there was only two other tables, both (2 tops) came after us and was receiving food before us. Â Food was hot and good tho.  Had take out here several time. Always a wait so your food just sit there and gets cold or they forgot an item. But today was the worst!!! I came in said I was there for pick up and then we go through the process of checking the food. I noticed how hard and dark my original chicken crispers were I then told the server that it didn't look right. The server however thought it was a good idea to basically say I am wrong and that's how they always looked and made a point to tell me they had just been cooked. No! They looked like chicken that had been sitting out and they wanted to refry them and pass them off as new ones. Waited another 3 minutes for fresh ones. They looked fine and I paid and went home. Only to find out the breading is undercooked and the other half of my food is overcooked. HORRIBLE!!!  Either they have a cook who doesn't know how to cook or they don't give a crap about customer satisfaction.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg
Jeremiah M.,"Rosenberg, TX",100,270,703,3.0,9/12/2017,"This place has good food and good variety, but what they lack is great service. Their greeting staff makes themselves scarce and when there aren't that many people in the restaurant, it still takes a while to be seated. The servers themselves are usually good, but a bit absent minded. It's hard to cast a wide net across them all because we have had great servers there, but overall it's not been outstanding.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg
Roman B.,"Rosenberg, TX",93,18,24,4.0,6/7/2017,"Chilis, like most other chains, is very hit or miss. I understand it's very much a ""bang for your buck"" type of place and due to lower food prices, you can typically expect a lower quality of service and possibly food. However, today I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of both. After having to seat ourselves at the bar area due to there being no apparent host, my mother and I both ordered the 6 oz sirloin and two house salad options from the 2 for 20 menu. The steaks were cooked to our liking and aside from one of my sides coming out late, everything seemed okay. Our server/bartender was solid, taking into consideration how much ground he had to cover. An excellent option for two people looking to avoid cooking at home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg
Izzy M.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,3,,1.0,10/17/2017,"We stopped by on a Tuesday afternoon, 2:30pm. Walked in to an unattended restaurant. No servers, hostess, or managers in sight! Customer looked pissed because they were holding menus and no one taking there orders. Get it together Chilis-Rosenberg!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg
Maddy T.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,44,9,1.0,1/28/2017,"Firstly, I understand it's a chilis and not a 5 star restaurant and they have lately tried to lure in customers with a new revised menu and new decor so we came in.  Fairly slow and took about 30 minutes for food.  Ordered the sizzling fajitas with two steak orders for about 15 dollars. (Had to pay an extra 2 dollars for steak for each order) so almost 17 dollars. On top of that you have to pay 1.50 for rice and beans no longer included.  And what we received was not enough steak for one person.  The manager just implied we were wrong and that it has always been this way. Although maybe a year ago or two I know that me and my 2 friends could go and split the fajitas. The funny part was they included 6 tortillas like there was ANY way we could make 6 steak tacos from this.  Ordered the dessert and it's now almost 8 dollars for a cake. It seems like chili's has been raising prices without raising quality of food.  We feel extremely ripped off and for their new prices it seems insane. Not coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg
Hannah E.,"Bellaire, Houston, TX",125,12,6,5.0,3/19/2017,Good food but most importantly our server Brooke was awesome! She was very sweet. We came in for my nieces fifth birthday (she wanted to play with the tablet they have at the tables) and she went all out for her birthday and made it very special. Thank you Brooke!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg
Alyksandr S.,"Houston, TX",58,32,82,1.0,5/8/2016,"I should've read the reviews before entering this location.  Before getting our table, we were speaking about how long it had been since the last time we ate at a Chili's. We were complementing the nice decor, food selection, and drink selection. We were so eager to try this restaurant again, but that all changed as we walked in.  As we entered the restaurant, the location was pretty much empty with exception of 3 tables that were fully occupied. First, It took approximately 10 minutes to sit us at a table. As we sat down, the friendly waitress took our drink orders and then brought us our drinks. She then took our food orders and basically disappeared. 45 minutes later she came to ask us if we needed some refills but at this time we were upset because no one had come to explain to us why our orders were taking so long. Before thinking about walking out, the waitress informed us that the manager was helping her serve our food to bring it to us. Finally, after an hour long wait (in an empty restaurant) our food was brought out. To make things worse, one of the orders was wrong and we just returned it.  I do not understand the service in this establishment and apparently we have not been the only ones who experienced this poor service. We were expecting the manager to come and apologize and check on us to see if everything was ok after we had been served, but NOPE. He didn't acknowledge the only table he had on that one section. No apologies for wrong order nor the long 1 hour wait. We will definitely not be returning to this establishment. Such a disappointment!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg
Faisal I.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,2.0,2/19/2017,"I am a regular here because I love their chocolate cake. I have always ordered to go and tonight was my first time dining here. We were seated right away but when our server came to our table he did not even introduce himself. He was very rude, did not greet or smile and pretty much there the menu on the table and walked away. I ordered a salad and when it finally came I was not given silverware to eat with until asked for. I will probably keep coming here to pick up their cake but not dining here again. BAD AND RUDE SERVICE",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg
Cody W.,"Rosenberg, TX",71,23,1,1.0,12/18/2016,"I feel like you know what you're getting when you go to a Chili's. Â Acceptable food and average service for a reasonable price are the drawing feature to this restaurant chain. Â This particular location, unfortunately, fails to meet the very attainable standard set by Chili's restaurants. We have come to this location on a few different occasions for a small late night bite to eat and a drink or two. Â The service is always questionable and the food and drink is never great, but it serves the purpose for which we are looking. Â What I would normally rate as a two or three star establishment dropped to a rare one star rated location yesterday. We walked in to try lunch on a Saturday afternoon. We were seated quickly, but that's where the service stopped. We sat there for almost fifteen minutes and no one even came to acknowledge us. There was no drink order, no waters, or even a hello. Â More than three different servers and staff members made eye contact with us as we patiently waited, but nothing. Â Finally, in awe, we smiled, laughed it off, and stood up from our booth to walk out. On our way out the woman who had originally shown us to our seat glanced our way as we walked by and then continued to go about her business. Â We are never rude, regardless of the situation, and we were not this time either, but we did have to leave and walk to the McAllisters next door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg

Tara B.,"Lubbock, TX",74,247,131,2.0,12/1/2015,"I came here at 1:30 on a Tuesday. For a light lunch. I do not know my waitress's name, she never said. If she come back I'll ask. I was seated in a corner of one section, 4 feet from another couple and near a table of 5. The dining room cleared out by 1:40 and the other people near me had their food. My drink came at 1:46, although I'm not sure why it took so long. Â No sign of the waitress as I type this. Â My food came out at 1:56, almost 30 minutes after I ordered. My salmon was hot, the shrimp and potatoes were hot, and the broccoli was more raw than steamed but I'm good with that, usually. I'm very pleased the food was good. I was frustrated that the waitress was not more attentive. That's too bad. I'm afraid this review is more along the lines of the others I have read. The food was good, the service was not. The restaurant was clean, I watched the hostess clean several tables during my visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg
F A.,"Sugar Land, TX",1,11,2,1.0,4/15/2017,Worst location ever. I would just drive further out and go to the one near Williams trace location. The manager at this location is unqualified to be in the position. All staff here are kids that can careless about customer service. One waiter smelled so bad it was gross to be served food from him. We just walked out and left. The place has barely any customers yet they take over 30min to get the food out. They should just shutdown this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg
Tom H.,"Richmond, TX",22,72,3,1.0,5/30/2016,"Chili's needs to stop.

Jon R.,"Bay City, TX",32,52,13,1.0,6/28/2015,"The only reason this is one star is because I can't have a lower rating. The service was horrible. The waitress was more busy talking to other customers to even take our drink order to begin with. While waiting on another beer, the bartender was walking around and chatting with other customers while I waited more than 10 minutes for a beer. The bar had 8 people total in it, they weren't busy.  The food was decent, but the service made me more than willing to never return. What a bad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg?start=20
Jerry R.,"Richmond, TX",0,7,,3.0,8/13/2016,It's been many years since I had been to Chili's so I decided to stop by with my cousin for an appetizer and a drink. The guy who took our order was polite and all and got us our drinks pretty quick. Now the appetizer on the other hand took forever! Went to the men's room and it was filthy. A roll of toilet paper was unrolled on the floor and as I was going back to my seat I was looking about and seen paper napkins on the floor and two waitresses just standing around talking. Never again will I be going back! Update:  Since my visit I was contacted by Chili's and they assured me that they would address my issues regarding my last visit so I reluctantly went back about a month later and yes my experience there was much better. But I will only give them a three star rating even though they corrected the issues and hopefully it will stay that way.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg?start=20
Tracy S.,"Rosenberg, TX",52,54,4,4.0,5/2/2016,We were sat super fast. Service was good and the food was great as always.

Bob O.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,63,,5.0,1/6/2017,Always stellar service! Always good food. Occasionally slow because they're understaffed but that is not the service staffs fault.

Katie J.,"Austin, TX",14,8,,3.0,8/20/2015,"I'm in town for business and figured Chili's was a safe bet.  The hostess (sweet lady) noticed my drink order hadn't been taken about 5 minutes after being seated, so she took my order. The waitress was attentive until a large group of men came in halfway through the meal. Service went down hill after that. The hostess came back around and offered me a to go drink. She was the best part of the experience. She went above and beyond her responsibilities, because the waitress was not providing good customer service.  I ordered the smothered chicken burrito (new item). It looked nothing like the picture - way bigger and kind of sloppy. It did not come with a side of black beans, as advertised. The taste was okay. I ordered a dessert to go and when I got it back to my hotel, there was no plastic-ware. It's Chili's though, so I don't know what I expected.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg?start=20

Makayla S.,"Houston, TX",120,8,6,1.0,3/24/2016,"My husband and I love chili's and we were so excited when we moved out here to see how close this one is, sadly it's horrible.  We've ordered to go 3 times from there with the same result each time. When we got there we waited 20 minutes for our food to be ready, even though we went at the time they said it'd be ready. We've had to check out order before leaving the restaurant because each time they have left something we ordered out of the bag, the food is cold, not just a 5 minutes drive home cool, but cold when we pull it out of the bag, when we've gotten burgers the buns are ripped and they look thrown together, the salad looks disgusting and has wilted/brown lettuce. It's just a very poorly managed location. We've tried calling about the quality of the food once or twice but it doesn't do any good. We've also eaten inside twice thinking it was just the to go, it's not. The food and service is the same quality inside as it is in to go. It's worth the drive to go to another location, even the one 20 minutes from us, the food is still warm and put together by the time we get home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg?start=20

I show up 10 minutes later to pick up my food - understandable that it wasn't ready - but the poor guy next to me had been there for 20 minutes and he placed the order about 15 minutes before he showed up. The waiter had accidentally given his order to the lady who had just walked out so he had to chase her down to get the food back. 10 minutes later (20 minutes now) I'm still waiting for our food. They weren't busy in the restaurant, but the to go service was very busy. The location infront of HEB closed because of poor service and not enough revenue, hope this one isn't. Unsure if we will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg?start=40
Amy K.,"Richmond, TX",3,7,2,1.0,10/3/2014,Normally have pretty decent food and service here but not this week. Â Terrible food (twice in the same visit) and terrible service from manager. Sure we will be back because not Alot of restaurants out here but still nasty!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg?start=40
Benjamin T.,"Richmond, TX",43,35,176,3.0,8/21/2014,"It's Chili's so you know about the food. I have been at this location about ten times. Seven of those time the service was below average. Usually when I go it is not busy, but the service is poor. As I speak I ordered wings with ranch, and they brought me blue cheese.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg?start=40
Roel R.,"Wharton, TX",0,8,,1.0,11/6/2015,"I wish I could put 0 stars. Â Came here for drinks and watch Thursday night football. Â Basically planning on spending a few hundred dollars over the course of the evening. Â The restaurant side had 4 people. Â The bar had about 10. Â TV was good so I stood at one of the tall tables at the bar with 2 others. Â 2 more members of our party showed up (5 total) and we were advised we could not stand at the bar table because it was made for 4 people and only had 4 chairs, and having an extra body standing there was a fire hazard for the wait-staff to move between the restaurant. Â I looked around, the whole place was essentially empty so I asked if I could talk to the manager to try to accommodate our party. Â The waitress says ""oh you sure can"" in a sarcastic/rude way and leaves. Â The manager comes a few minutes later and we have the same conversation. Â I explain that ther bar is empty and I don't see why we could not just stand at the table. Â She says there's no exceptions. Â I was rather mad by that point, so I told them I could fix the problem by having zero people at the table, and B-dubs across the plaza was jammed packed because they treat their customers better than this. Â I wasn't going to beg to stay, so we paid for our first round and left. BTW...as we're leaving there's another party that advised me that they were put on a wait list to be seated, when there was no one there too...said they also had a ""weird"" experience at this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg?start=40
Ricardo C.,"Richmond, TX",0,2,,5.0,3/15/2015,"Food was amazing! Cooked perfectly, and arrived on time. Our waiter Ben is the best server I've ever had anywhere. He was quick, attentive, and very nice. I will definitely come back here again just because of him. Granted everything else was great, service is my number one concern when trying a new restaurant or new location. This place had it all!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg?start=40
Mark S.,"Sugar Land, TX",10,23,6,1.0,11/30/2014,"Everything was good until the food came out. My wifes burger was, well, basically bleeding. Way indercooked. It was still raw. The place was dead so no excuse. They did make another one but it took more than 15 minutes and in the meantime my food was cold because I didnt want to eat all my food while my wife watched. The manager did appologize, but that was it. He should have made sure my wifes food came out much quicker.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg?start=40
Chase W.,"Needville, TX",23,4,,4.0,12/4/2013,"Food is always good at Chili's but this time our waiter sucked horribly. I had to wait about 10 minutes to get refills on my sweet tea. It was to the point where I almost got up and served myself. Not fun when you have 2 young kids with you that need refills also. But like I said, food was awesome, had the bacon cheddar burger with fries. Will definitely be going back again, just hope I get a different server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg?start=40
Lissa B.,"Needville, TX",0,5,,1.0,4/2/2015,"Worst experience ever! Â I'm a health care professional (nurse) and my coworkers and I decided to go have a COUPLE of drinks after work, which is rare for us between work, kids, Â husbands, etc. Had a great time venting/socializing to each other until the check came and some of us were charged for an extra drink. Â Would have been fine if they would have just corrected the bills BUT we had to go through the waiter to a manager and then to another manager (MARIBEL) that had the audacity to say if they ordered extra drinks they would be sitting on the bar and there were no drinks on the bar. Â Pretty much calling us liars! She then went through the whole visit with us from round to round as if we were alcoholics trying to get free drinks! While trying to explain to Maribel over and over that we did not order/drink those extra drinks added to our ticket she rolled her eyes and said ""It doesn't even matter"" and finally fixed our check! Wow! Â Worst/childish/unprofessional restaurant manager ever! Besides that mess the food was good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg?start=40
J S.,"Rosenberg, TX",0,2,,1.0,8/10/2015,The cook was eating and working on our food. Â The manager saw us watching him and told him to move out our line of sight. Â The food was cold and the service was awful.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg?start=40
Kevin T.,"Buford, GA",34,44,38,4.0,7/3/2013,So Chilis is Chilis but as soon as you walk in you feel like family! Everyone are talking drinking and having fun! so far I have felt welcomed to an elite team lol I just saw where one of the guys poured Tabasco sauce in his miller! Supposedly everyone here does! Great times decent food but wonderful regulars!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg?start=40
S C.,"Richmond, TX",1,11,2,1.0,4/26/2014,Wow! Â Worst experience ever at Chili's. Â We were Â there an hour and a half. Â Waitress made an error inputting our order and it was never sent to the kitchen. Â  She would have known this if she had came by our table the next twenty or so minutes after the order. Â Another waiter refilled the chips and salsa. Another one had refilled our drinks before we ordered food. Â  To me the worst part was never having the manager come over and apologize. Â  Food was okay. Â Came out after each part was cooked so it was separated. Will not go back to this location. Â (Was told they are about to go through a remodeling),https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg?start=40
Dottie H.,"Rosenberg, TX",2,68,,4.0,2/10/2013,"I lived in Sugar Land for 35 years. The Chili's in SL has consistently gone downhill, so much that we would not go there. Service was just dreadful and very slow (if you could get a waiter at all), orders mixed up. Poor manager. This one in Rosenberg, however, rocks. Service is fantastic, waiters friendly and caring about you, and food is generally good! Always a line of people. However, I do always order the Carribbean salad and the chicken is very bland. No taste. They must keep it in a water based heater like McDonald's. Blah! But the enchilada soup is very good! Hubby likes his orders. And I love any salad with Honey Lime Dressing. But they DO need to fix the bland chicken.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg?start=40
Karla M.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,4.0,3/17/2013,"This chili's probably had the best costumer service I've ever experienced from any chili's I've been to. Our waiter Bryce, or Brice was really interactive and provided us with an unforgettable time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg?start=40
