Monique H.,"Sacramento, CA",70,76,107,3.0,1/13/2018,"Came in for a surprise lunch for my mom's birthday. So it was a large party, at first the server seemed like she had it handled and was   with drink and food orders. There were a lot of things ordered and many variations of the same thing. Food came out not too long after the order was placed, and the food was tasty and the temperature was ok.  Once the food came the attention from the wait staff fell. Drinks were empty and empty plates littered the table. We brought in a cake and they brought that out but we then had to wait for plates and forks. Overall the experience was okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roseville
Aaron T.,"Rocklin, CA",382,188,116,4.0,11/28/2017,"This review is a tough one. Chili's is a chain restaurant and you know what that's all about already. Satisfactory food. That in of itself doesn't tell you much. As noted, the food is fine. You pay for -- in this case -- cheap Tex-Mex food. The margaritas are adequate, the chips are good, the salsa is better than expected and the rest is Tex-Mex-iness.  The space itself is, again, unremarkable. The restaurant itself is on the cleaner side, so I'll give it that. Chili's staff are friendly, nice and chatty.  I'm torn, since three stars (""A-OK"") seems low because, as a chain restaurant, I'm not holding this place to the same standard I would a unique establishment. I'm giving Chili's four stars not so much because I'm a fan but because it's a bit better than other bland, unremarkable, boring and blah chain restaurants. Thanks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roseville
JennyLynn J.,"Fresno, CA",50,4,,1.0,9/16/2017,"We had a server that we only saw long enough to take our order (which didn't come back correct) and didn't see him again. Very inattentive. We were to an an excuse for him by another server but that's not our fault as a guest.

Phani K.,"Roseville, CA",0,13,12,3.0,12/19/2017,"Decided to go to chili's after so long. The server was very nice but the service was really slow. Ordered French fried, onion rings and nachos for appetizers. The nachos were cooked in a way where each chip had a lot of cheese on top, but taste wise it was average. It was lacking more toppings. Then for main course I ordered the grilled chicken fajitas. It was a huge portion, came with 4 small tortillas and lot of chicken. I added my own little touch and put fries in it too, it was satisfying.  I just wish the wait wasn't that long, but overall food was decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roseville
Lauren M.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",6,8,1,2.0,1/6/2018,I am a huge fan of chillis and came to this location while visiting the area. The service was fine and so was the food. My only reason for such a bad review is how absolutely disgusting this location was. We were sat down at a table with ketchup all over the place and dirty napkins on the table and crumbs everywhere. It clearly had not been wiped down at all. There was only a few other customers here so there was no reasons for this. When asked to get our table clean the waitresses asked the buss boy that was sitting at a table with his friends to clean. He grab a towel and simply pushed all the trash on the floor and sat back down with his friends. All the empty tables were equally if not more dirty then ours. Mean while all the waiters sat around talking and continued to  walking around the mess,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roseville

Christine N.,"Yuba City, CA",0,11,27,1.0,4/16/2016,"If there was a way to give zero stars it would have been for this visit.  Chili's is just another ""box eatery"" - I don't know what an equivalent name would be so I'll steal the gist from 'box store'.  I don't have incredible expectations, but because this is that type of eatery, I hold my customer service standards to be of the norm.  Even then, it was far from met.   Usually Chili's is a great place to take kids because no one really notices if your kids are being a little loud.  It's family friendly.  Menu is the same everywhere.  However, I won't be returning to this particular Chili's due to subpar service, all around.  What a difference a location and its employees can make on an experience.  (See my rating of a different Chili's).   A) We got into Chili's and asked for a high chair.  We were given one with just one strap.  We asked the hostess, as she literally walked away from the table, if we could have another one because of the missing strap.  As we were doing so, a table adjacent to us decided to also use that opportunity to complain about their highchair.  (This table had been at the establishment long enough to already be eating their appetizers.)  The hostess then went to go look for other highchairs; turns out they only had one chair in complete condition that was available.  She came back with the chair, went to our table first to let us know, and then also told us that because the other diners were there first they were going to get the working chair.  She would bring us a chair if one became available.  We asked as to why they were getting the chair first even though we complained first and she offered no reason or even apology.  Issue was never revisited by hostess or manager, etc.  When we inquired again, they brought out a chair with a partially broken clasp - but a chair that clasped and did work nonetheless.  Why they thought this chair wasn't as good as the one with the missing strap beats me.   B) Our server took a long time to come by the table to get our order.  We asked for the kids' meals to be put in first (and it made no difference).  Our server took a long time to check on us.  Our server took a long time in general.   C) Food was delayed.  It was not extremely busy nor packed.  We were seated right away and there were plenty of empty booths and tables still.  There is no reason the kids' meals should have taken as long as they did.   D) We ordered our entire meal with dessert all at once.  The server decided to withhold the dessert order AND forgot.  She came to the table to tell us about how we could pay at the kiosk and then remembered she hadn't put our dessert order in.   E) Our server was missing.  A lot.  We had to go to the hostess or other servers for things like napkins, to-go boxes.   F) Our kiosk didn't print out a valid receipt.  If you're going to rely on a kiosk to do part of your job, make sure it's doing the job.   Oh, and yes, we did leave a review (available on the kiosks) and we did let the server and hostess know that we were upset about the delayed dessert order and highchair.  It didn't seem to make a difference.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roseville?start=60
Caitlin S.,"Livermore, CA",0,38,1,1.0,1/4/2017,"I tried to order take out tonight (Wednesday) starting at 915 and was hung up on over and over because I'm assuming whoever was working takeout did not want to take the order. I work in the industry, I know what goes on. If 45 minutes is too late to place an order before closing, fine, but I think I deserve the decency to be TOLD that instead of being hung up on. Finally, someone answers the phone at 935 and tells me they do not take take out orders 30 minutes before closing.

Brooke R.,"Roseville, CA",23,33,14,1.0,4/13/2015,"This location can NEVER EVER get a to go order correct. I stopped going to this location awhile ago but since the Douglas location closed (who knew how to do to go orders correctly), I thought I would try it again. Totally regret it.  I ordered the 20 dollar dinner for two,  both with chipotle honey crispers,  which i have in the past,  and they've given it to me with the chipotle sauce on the side so it basically chicken strips with sauce. Completely impossible to eat it the way its served in the restaurant if your actually on the go. I'm completely aware of this and ask EVERY single time if they can toss it,  80 percent of the time,  it is not. And surprise, surprise, this time it was not either.  I paid extra for onion rings (1.00) and there was literally 3 onion rings on my boyfriends plate. My sides were a salad (1.00) and loaded mashed potatoes,  which I didn't get at all. I also didn't get any ranch or dipping sauces for any of the crispers. Just the chipotle sauce that was supposed to be tossed with my chicken. I hate having to go in and finish making my own meal when I just paid and tipped someone to do that for me.  Also the to go area was dark,  I had to go up to the bar area and chase down the bartender to pay. It took an extra 10 minutes or so,  so I was sitting in the dark to go area when the bartender calls my name from the bar and just stands there bag in hand staring as if I was wasting her time.  I will not be back, I've encountered better customer service before,  but I've spend too much damn money here to justify getting ripped off every time I order from here. Avoid,  unless you like babying employees on how to do thier job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roseville?start=60
Denny T.,"Sacramento, CA",187,612,403,1.0,5/28/2014,"In February 2013 I had one of the two worst experiences at Chili's. Unlikely ever to come back to any after this last trip. My woman and I wanted to partake in Happy Hour. We proceeded to sit in the bar section and was not acknowledged for a good five minutes. The staff then gave us a menu and did not return for a good five minutes without any offer for beverages or appetizers while getting to order. We finally got to our order of Happy Hour items and menu items. We did not order anything away from the menu. No special customization. When we finally got our order in the beverages took another ten minutes. The first of appetizers didn't arrive for 20 minutes. Our drinks were finished but the server never came back around to check if we wanted another beverage. I didn't bother order anymore beverages. Another family sat down nearby at this time. The got there and was given there beverages within five minutes. At this time my woman and I have already completed the first of two ordered appetizers and our only ordered drinks. Our second appetizer arrived after the family's order showed up. I would say another 15 minutes later. We finally get a second drink, the water we had to ask for and refilled. The rest of our meal shows up ten minutes after. My women and I proceed to dine. We somehow still finish our meal before the family. I gave method of payment for the meal and I had to wait for another tens minutes for the change. The family still ended up with their check and payment before I even get my change. You never know how food will settle with your stomach. You do know when it was not prepared correctly. My lady and I definitely paid tribute to the restroom when we got home. I don't know what was more infuriating.  1- A two hour meal for my woman and I. As opposed to one hour for the family. 2- Wondering why the food took over 40 minutes to get to us. 3- Waiting waitress to come back around so I can order another beverage. Only to wait too long for any attention and not wanting anymore and just wanting to leave. 4- Having to continuously ask for beverages when the staff never came back.  5- Why the waitress hung onto my payment for so long. 6- Why the manager on duty never checked on the dining patrons. 7- Getting sick after going home.  Lastly, the restroom in this facility had COLD water. Anybody that understand sanitary standards, understands this is a most grievous food safety issue. When an employee washes their hands, they have not effectively used the soap to wash away their bathroom business.  I consider service and quality of care to customers as a basis for tips. Service wasn't good, but I still gave my server a tip in spite. By any means this server needs to learn to do a better job. Or this server needs to have a manager that will work. She needs to understand hard work pays. I have already filled out a receipt survey about the location. I have already filed county food violation form. Thank you Chili's for any survey feedback. Perhaps you should not have surveys printed on receipts if you don't address them in a timely fashion. I definitely won't be coming back. Update I was contacted by Chili's staff shortly after the complaint. I revisited another Chili's. My opinion remains unimproved and unimpressed by the chain. It is a shame that quality and service are not what it was once was before the experiences.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roseville?start=60

Never actually met Keenan cause Kayla took care of our table during the entire visit. Very friendly, polite, and patient despite our indecisiveness. Had no issues with our order.  All the staff were on top of their game despite being slightly busy for the 2014 World Series game 7 (the Giants won! Whooooohooo!).

Beckie V.,"Modesto, CA",0,13,1,5.0,10/13/2016,Just had the best experience at this Chilis in Rocklin. I am staying at a nearby hotel and ordered my meal online after a long day at work. When I picked up my order the Chilis an employee could not find my online order.  Her manager Hiram came out to review my order. He explained the timing may have resulted in the order being pushed out to the next day since I ordered close to closing.  Hiram was so kind to take our order and make us comfortable while we waited. He even offered us a complimentary soda.  When he brought out our order he took care to give us instructions on how to prepare our molten cake using the microwave in our hotel room. He put the cold items in a separate bag from the hot items. Through all of this he was very gracious and kind. He said he puts himself in his customers shoes and creates an experience he would want for himself. GIVE HIM A RAISE! Chilis should acknowledge and value employees like this. Rocklin you are lucky to have Hiram represent your establishment. It is amazing how one person can affect your view of an entire company.  Hiram turned what could have neen a bad experience into a positive one.  Chilis is on my list of faves now!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roseville?start=60

It was incredible, along with the old favorites there were many new items. Of course the chips and salsa are something we always go for. Very consistent and delicious. Next was a smokehouse bacon burger with fries. This was cooked perfectly and very delicious. My wife had soup and salad which looked very fresh and the chicken tortilla soup was delicious as well. We also indulged in a Southwest eggrolls, one of our longtime favorites... Brings back memories. Our son(2 1/2)had a grilled cheese sandwich and a large piece of corn, he ate half the sandwich and the whole piece of corn and was very happy. We were greeted at the door and shown our seats there were quite a few people there for 1130 on Wednesday morning but the service was great.

Informed the waiter the same and he said pick something else - (well, we picked up something from the menu already). We just decided to pay the bill & leave..now more troubles..The smart kiosk they have on our table has the wrong bill since there was a mix up with our backtable who had our bill which was half of their actual bill (which we had) & apparently they paid that showed up on their kiosk and left. Waiter informed they are fixing it & disappeared for 20 mins. He then comes up with a paper bill & disappears again which was still wrong. He comes back to serve table next to us & then he took it back to got it fixed finally.  Alright tasteless food, 25 mins wait to pay your bill, terrible service.

Seriously though, running through July 3rd you get a side salad, half rack of ribs, french fries and molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream/hard shell chocolate (drum roll please!!!) fooooorrrrrrrrrr $10.99. Good deal!!! Make it a full rack for $6 more. I was all over that like flies on sh!t. Of course I made it a full rack, since, you know, I wasnt paying. Lol. Another cool thing you can split the half racks into two different flavors. It was well worth it and some good grub. Plus watching my A's pound the Giants was a special added bonus.

Jenny P.,"Midtown, Sacramento, CA",1077,510,3801,4.0,10/26/2015,"I really miss the Chili's on Eureka and Rocky Ridge, but this one also gets the job done. It's tradition with a group of my high school friends that we end a night at Chili's. We did this recently to conclude an evening of screaming ourselves hoarse and blowing out our hearing at Aftershock 2015. There are two things that stand out at this Chili's, making it a dependable choice in the Roseville area. 1. Service The waitress we had was a doll. They seem to always be on top of it here. Drinks, appetizers, and entrees were out without much delay at all, and it seemed to be reasonably busy for a Saturday night. They were out of a seasonal cocktail still listed on the menu, so the waitress gave me a recommendation that was on point with what I was originally wanting to order. It was super yummy! My friend asked for a little bit of soda to take care of his low blood sugar, so she brought him a kid's cup and didn't charge him. That kind of thing really makes me want to come back to a place.  2. Quality of Food Chains are often all over the place with food quality, I've found. You visit one location and it could be a completely different experience from another location. I went to a Chili's in San Leandro and it was cold wings and soggy fries. This location serves food that looks exactly like it does on the menu. No gross textures or lukewarmish cold plates to be found here. Good job reppin' R ville, Chili's. Nice to know we can still count on you after all these years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roseville?start=20
Jenni T.,"Roseville, CA",346,970,7114,3.0,10/10/2015,"I came to this Chilis location with my Husband and Mother in Law for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. They weren't busy inside which was nice, because we were able to find parking and a table easily. Let me say up front that I HATE the new stupid iPad like tablets that they now have on every table. You can order food and pay on then (credit cards only) but isn't that what a server is for? You can also play games on them but I think eating out should be a special occasion and an event to spend quality time with your family and friends. Not one to have your face buried in another electronic device. Does this make me old? Maybe. My Husband and I always order the same thing every time we go to Chili's. He has the Buffalo Chicken Salad which he loves. It's an ample sized salad with a good amount of crispy spicy buffalo chicken. I always get the Unlimited Soup and Salad Combo which comes with Chips and Salsa, a House Salad and a bowl of Potato Soup. The salad is ok (I'm not a big salad fan) but the Potato Soup is really great. Super cheesy and flavorful and it can be made Vegetarian by taking the bacon off the top. The chips and salsa are really good too, but think they should come free with every meal. They do give a large basket though which is enough for the whole table to share. I can only finish one serving of everything even though it's unlimited. They also have A Black Bean Burger, Enchiladas and a Flatbread Pizza for Vegetarians as well. Service was good and the place was kept clean. I would come back again for lunch because of the unlimited soup/salad/chips combo and the prices aren't bad. Not the most healthy meal, but good for the occasional treat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roseville?start=20

Joe P.,"Rocklin, CA",141,434,73,4.0,1/18/2016,"I have to be honest with you. I was absolutely *SHOCKED* by what Chili's has to offer these days.  I haven't been to a Chili's in at least a year and their revamped menu is legit. They've revamped the whole thing... and it was clear right from the get-go.  My wife ordered a side-salad and she was totally expecting a pre-packaged, iceberg salad.  Instead, it looked like fresh mixed greens with leafy lettuces (rather than iceberg) as well as other greens.  We were all pretty surprised. All of us ordered something from their new Mexican food menu, beginning with the appetizer.  We ordered chips and guac.  There are two options on the chips and guac - one is table side and the other is ""fresh"" guac... I don't know the difference, but since it was $2 less to have it sent from the kitchen rather than in front of me, I figured I'd order it from the kitchen. For $5.49 you get a ton of guac - probably at least a half-pint.  The bowl they put it in was overflowing and it was very, very fresh... it seems as if they made it back in the kitchen as there were several pieces of guac that weren't fully cut up (but that was fine.. I smashed it up myself).  It wasn't the best guac I ever had - probably because it is majority guac and salsa/veggies rather than what they do at Chipotle - which has serious amounts of other items (like cream). I ordered the three tacos plate.  It came with black beans and w lime/cilantro white rice (notice everyone is moving to this?).  I had one carnitas and I wanted to try their new prime rib tacos so I ordered two of those.  The carnitas had more flavor (as it should) but I can't hate on the prime rib tacos.  They were very tender.  They also put cheese, rice, salsa and a slice of avocado in the tacos wrapped in a flour tortilla (one thing I didnt like... I'd prefer corn). My wife ordered a chicken burrito which she finished... and she NEVER finishes her burritos.  Usually she takes half home. My father in law had fajitas with the prime rib and shrimp.  They looked really good... although I'll admit - they looked significantly greasier than Chevy's.  But he loved them and definitely cleaned his plate. My mother in law had a salmon plate with broccoli.  The broccoli looked like it was just steamed - still a bit crispy and not mushy. My son wanted pizza.... so that is what we got him.  It was almost exactly like Pizza Hut's personal pizza.  Looked and tasted the same.  I don't think they're owned by the same company (Yum brands) - but it seems there is some kind of partnership going on... there are also tweets about it. Anyway - the place was great... have to commend them for getting fresher and healthier. Don't get me wrong, you're not going to save a bunch of calories by going here.... but you'll have much better options. This restaurant is one of many (Red Robin being another) that has that stupid tablet device where you can pay your bill and order stuff.  The ordering didnt seem to work... so it ended up being a huge paper-weight during our actual meal.  The nice thing was, with a 2.5 year old and 8 month old, being able to pay when the kids start to lose it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roseville?start=20

Kimberly M.,"Sunnyvale, CA",133,92,116,3.0,3/24/2016,"Vegan review!  I will forever love Chili's Presidente Margaritas. You just can't go wrong with it honestly.  It's strong, but not overpowering. It has always been executed wonderfully in various locations.  And this spot did it well. Five stars for the margaritas and signature cocktails. Pricing is moderate, but it's whats expected from a restaurant.  As for the food selection...it's okay for vegans. I honestly go for chips and table side guac and I'm a happy camper.  Recently, I was actually hungry for more than booze and guac (shocker) and ordered vegetable cadillac fajitas. I'm used to any fajita plate they offer coming with tortillas. Imagine my surprise when all I saw was TONS of rice. I was too hungry to care and inquire.  My veggie fajitas consisted of some onions, some bell peppers, a bunch of broccoli (which I wasn't expecting) and rice on top of the platter. I'm used to my rice and beans being on the side....which I still got. So I had a TON of rice.  I would have definitely preferred tortillas to enjoy making my own tacos, but I was really there for the margarita anyway.

We eat all the chips and salsa at this point no point in getting guac but it comes no apology or reason why.

Michelle W.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,7,,1.0,7/23/2017,"If there was a separate rating system based on service, I'd be giving ZERO stars.  We were there to celebrate a friend's birthday.  They called ahead to make a reservation for a party of 8, and were told a reservation was indeed needed for a party of that size.  The hostess called back to ask if we could move up the reservation time from 7:00 to 8:15, which was fine, and we all arrived promptly on time.  When we arrived, the host was incredibly rude and had a real smart mouth and attitude.  He said we didn't have a reservation, because they don't take reservations for parties of less than 10.  If that's the case, fine, but there was no need for the rudeness.  A less abrasive, more service oriented approach would have been, ""We're sorry for the confusion with your reservation, but we'll try to get you a table as soon as we can"".  The host just shrugged, as if to say, ""Oh well, not my problem"".  When we asked if a table might be available for us at some point, he responded with, ""I don't know.  Maybe 30-45 minutes"".  We didn't expect to be catered to, but WE didn't make the reservation mistake. This isn't the first time this host has been incredibly rude.  My husband and I came here for lunch a couple of months ago, and this same guy was just an absolute jerk.  I wish he had been wearing a nametag so we could let the corporate office know his name when I call to complain.  I don't want to get anyone in trouble, but seriously, if this is how you treat your customers, you need to get out of this line of work.  We all have bad days, and I get that, but to be so rude, and to be the first person a customer speaks with when you walk in the door, is a very poor representation of Chili's. We didn't let it ruin our fun time last night though.  We went across the street to Applebee's and had a great meal, a great time, and great service.  None of us will be returning to Chili's and I would imagine most of our own family and friends won't be going back either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roseville?start=40

We never received water. It took two full hours for just 8 entrees and three desserts. With kids that is brutal- should have only taken an hour max. They said they would comp one dessert which they didn't and we had to wait 15 more minutes for them to fix the bill. Food was ok but the service was pretty subpar.

I told the manager I already had the salad and meal prepared and we only needed the ribs for Father's Day. They said they there was no way they could help me and someone gave me the wrong information. This just ruined our plans for today and we had to rush out and buy some chicken instead.

David W.,"Leander, TX",324,63,398,3.0,12/24/2015,"It's just another Chili's. With chain restaurants they are mostly all the same regardless of where you go. That can be a good thing. I know what I like to order and now and then they have cool new stuff to try. The thing that separates one from the other of course is the people and atmosphere.  I'm not going to criticize this location, this location is just fine. In my opinion it is like every other restaurant in the area and unfortunately a seemingly growing trend in regards to ""people and atmosphere"".  I try to think of an analogy and think of an amusement park. You know you wait in line excited for a new ride or even a familiar ride and wait, and wait all the while observing the employees manning the turnstiles, collecting tickets, seating a never ending stream of anxious customers to their designated seats while talking amongst themselves about what they are going to do once they finish their shift of this humdrum job.  Again I am not being critical of this Chili's rather what seems to be a widely accepted atmosphere, especially here in Roseville/Rocklin/or California as far as that goes. Most places in this area can get slammed and I understand the pain that must bring. Other industries would love and welcome such a pain!  So ""how was the ride"" you ask? it certainly wasn't exciting or fun for me. In fact I didn't see anyone that appeared happy to be on the ride. I'm not sure it was worth the wait but at least I got on the ride. After all, I was hungry.

It had the flavor of fish that was turning bad. Much of that was left on the plate too. My daughter had the kids meal mac and cheese with corn on the cob. Now bear in mind: she is a mac and cheese eating machine. She left half of it in the bowl.  All in all we had a very disappointing meal and we never heard from nor saw a manager.

The food:  On my first visit to this particular location, I ordered their Caribbean Salad with Grilled Shrimp: (The menu says: Fresh pineapple, mandarin oranges, dried cherries, green onions, cilantro, sesame seeds and honey-lime dressing. With your choice of grilled chicken or grilled shrimp). The salad was fresh and I was quite surprised at the abundant quantity of Grilled Shrimp I got, but the Dried Cherries and Sesame Seeds were missing! My girlfriend and I hadn't seen each other for quite some time and were gabbing it up a lot, so I didn't find the opportunity to mention it to them. Perhaps the abundant Shrimp trumped my complaint...? On my second visit with my husband at around 8pm on a Saturday night we ordered the $20 Dinner for Two; we chose: Chips n Salsa, Fried Shrimp and the 1/2 Rack Baby Back Ribs. The Salsa is boring and tastes canned, the chips were fresh and warm, tho'. The Shrimp and Ribs were at the perfect temperature when they arrived; the Shrimp was but plump and juicy, but flavorless. The Ribs were tasty but were quite dry at the bone, so you end up pulling/flossing much of it out of your teeth because it's dry. Both came with fries, in addition the Shrimp came with Cole Slaw (does anyone really eat soggy cabbage?) and this weird ""Tequila Lime Sauce"" for dipping the Shrimp; we didn't like it. The fries had a lot of dried and overcooked pieces hidden under the fresher made pieces - slick move Chili's...   Of particular note: They should offer a salad or veggies appetizer in this $20 Dinner for Two - wayyy too many carbs....

The shrimp was cooked and seasoned well, but that was the only part of my dish that I enjoyed. Our server was a tall young man who seemed very disorganized. The restaurant seemed to have average traffic for lunch time, and this kid was running around like a chicken without a head. He was very distracted and it was difficult to flag him when we needed something. We couldnt tell if he was ignoring us, or just that oblivious to his surroundings. I didnt realize my pasta meal came with garlic toast until the server randomly brought a slice over to me once I was almost done with my meal. He said ""heres your toast"" and walked away. I understand customer service isnt what it used to be, but theres got to be a line drawn somewhere before it goes completely extinct.

Shyla B.,"Antelope, CA",0,2,1,2.0,6/19/2013,"My husband and I had lunch there this past monday. When we first walked in we were greeted and promptly seated. It was pretty dead in there, but it was 2pm. It took about 10mins for our server to come to the table. We ordered our drinks, appetizer, and our meals. We ordered the southwest egg rolls for the appetizer, which came out promptly.  They were ok, not as good as I remember. Five minutes after we received our meals. I ordered the spicy shrimp tacos and my husband ordered a plan cheeseburger. The tacos were supposed to come with coleslaw in the tacos with the shrimp. What I got was dry lettuce,  which made the tacos dry. There was some sauce with the shrimp, but the shrimp was pretty dry and overcooked. The meal also came with your general rice and something they call beans that were in a soup cup..it was really watery and very unappealing. .gross. my husband's burger was dry. The service was not great. As soon as we got our food, she went to the table behind us and picked up their check and then came back to our table and asked how was everything. .seriously? You just dropped off our food 2 mins ago, I havent even touched it yet. Another pet peeve of mine, the biggest actually, is right when she put the food down on the table she dropped off the check.  I HATE that. It is so rude, it is trying to rush us and gives off the vibe that they dont care. I kinda understand, to an extent, if they are SUPER busy, but come on. We were probably the fourth table there.The server only came by to refill our drinks and take some plates.  Never said thankyou or you're welcome.

J N.,"Beverly Hills, CA",20,64,23,5.0,12/18/2010,"I put in an order during work, so I could pick it up when I got off... I walked in as a waiter was walking out. He had his phone out and a drink, so he looked like he was going on break. He stopped and greeted me and asked me what I needed. I told him about my to-go order and he referred me to a bartender who was supposed to process my order. I waited ... and finally they figured that I paid online and gave me my receipt. This went on while the waiter went into the kitchen to grab my order. I thanked him. I was glad to be done, so I jogged back to my car. I got into my car and checked my food. I had an order of artichoke dip without chips? I was pissed because I really just wanted to go home and eat.  I walked back in as the waiter was trying to walk out again, and he stopped and asked me what was wrong. I told him my issue and he dropped his things and ran into the kitchen. He handed me a BIG bag of chips and apologized for the inconvience. I apologized to him because he looked like he has been trying to go on  break, he told me it wasn't my fault and that he actually is off. He wants to go home too! But I couldn't tell because he stayed with me and made sure I was happy! I love it when people treat their customers like they are right. Which has been very hard to find these days (at least for me). There is nothing I hate more than an associate of a company (or a manager for that matter) is trying to excuse their wrong doing. Repeat with me slowly ... THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT. I'll never forget Elliot and his treatment. He corrected the error and made me forget about why I was mad. Also, he was trying to go home too ! Psh, I'm not even sure I would've done the same thing :P I called a manager the next day to tell him about Elliot.

Our server Juan had come back to our table with Mandarin oranges for my daughter who was already getting annoyed by not getting her food with ours.

Darren M.,"Roseville, CA",1,2,,2.0,1/1/2014,"My wife and I stopped in to have a late lunch. We sat on the bar side to get in and out a little quicker. I order the nacho and she ordered the triple dipper with wings and burger bites. Just appetizers, nothing special. Oh and we order two cokes. It took 30 minutes to get our order. I'm a patient person but 30 minutes for appetizers is ridiculous. The nacho was a joke. On the menu the nacho comes regular and large, I ordered the regular. I assumed (and yes I know what happens when you assume ) that it would be a plate with a decent typical nacho. Nope it was 8 nacho chips with cheese, a bit of meat and a jalapeño slice on each. My wife's wings were barely warm. We asked the waitress about the nacho when she brought it and she stated that the menu says the number of chips on the nacho. Of course my wife immediately looked at the menu and it doesn't state that. At that point I just wanted to eat and get out of there. No use in arguing over the number of chips, it was the fact that for the price it should be ""regular"" nacho. I didn't expect much from this restaurant but expected better service and food than what we received. The bill came to 26 dollars and change. What a waste of money.

We called and the manager, Todd, was so great. He offered to replace the burger (which was cooked perfectly!), fries, and even threw in a complimentary dessert.

Travis S.,"Las Vegas, NV",12,108,31,3.0,12/14/2014,This is a good chilli's but not the best. What makes the best chilli's is the cooks and these ones seem lazy. Our corn was boiled for a couple days and when they gave us a new one you could tell it was fresher but they probably hadn't changed the water in the pot for a while because it tasted like a sour corn tortilla. They gave us a free corn dog though so that's cool I guess. My pasta sat under the heat lamp too long so the noodles on top got hard and rubbery.

Don B.,"Antelope, CA",39,30,,1.0,8/18/2013,"Walked in party of 2, the restaurant was full. No manager in sight, teenager running the floor. She was the bright spot. She got us seated quickly, server came right over and took our order, we never saw her again until we got the check. They seem to have a ""team"" approach to waiting tables. They put 2 servers in a section, you would think that would prevent anyone being ignored, you would think, not so. In the meantime they sat a large party behind us, which became their main focus.  I ordered the shrimp tacos, my wife got the bacon ranch quesadilla's. Her's came out hot and fresh. Mine was stone cold including the rice and beans. I pushed it aside and had to flag the hostess to send them back. The only time we saw a manager, she came to tell ""just so you know, the slaw and salsa on the shrimp is cold so that will make the shrimp cold!"" No kidding? What about the rice and beans? Shouldn't they be hot? The reality mine died in the kitchen waiting for my wife's. She left in a huff and had the tacos remade. The beans and rice were obviously microwaved, The beans were still bubbling when they got to me.  After we were done our sever came back by and in her highest cutesy voice asked how everything was and if we wanted dessert. No, just the check. We then had to wait until she refilled the beverages at the large party behind us to get our check.  Hey Chili's, here's an idea, there are no customers in the back of your restaurants, hire and train expo people and get the managers out front to run them.  If your a manager never ever scold a guest because the food isn't what was expected. I've had food and service as good a Taco Bell.  If your a server had a copy of the check ready to go so your customer doesn't have to wait. That one little detail would have saved her tip.
