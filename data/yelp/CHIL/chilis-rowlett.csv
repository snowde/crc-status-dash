Cathy L.,"Garland, TX",91,3,,5.0,10/22/2017,"For the past year or so, hubby and I have patronized this particular Chili's on Saturday afternoons 3 out of four Saturdays per month.  The food is great and we always sit in Davids section.  He brings our chips, salsa, salads and drinks to us sometimes before we even get seated.  He is an azing waiter.  Ann and Nicole are amazing bartenders and Ira is also amazing.  Great staff, great food and kudos to the cooks for putting out such great food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett
Nhu N.,"Dallas, TX",2,8,9,1.0,1/14/2018,"Bad service. I can't speak for every waiter at this location but the two that ""took our orders"" were very pushy and rude when they took out order. Came in with a group of 5. We sat in the bar area and that's fine. As far as the food, not so good. Steak did not cook as ordered. Couple dishes came with fries but did not bring em to us til the check came and she did no bring sweet tea we asked for.. not again at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett
Amy H.,"Garland, TX",11,2,,1.0,11/3/2017,Chicken was raw in appetizer..had to send back...got smokehouse combo ribs chicken sausage... It was cold.sausage was ice cold ... Double charged us for appetizer...no one seemed to know anything...we will not be back..as i sit here typing this in the restaurant while manager tries to fux the check.....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett
Emily J.,"Dallas, TX",31,93,2,5.0,4/9/2017,"First time here we were very unhappy with the food. We gave it another try due to wait times in the area.  Very pleasant experience.  Service was quicker.  Waitress was very friendly.  The food was great. So we gave this location another shot a couple weeks ago. Again, we had an attentive waiter with a great personality. Very happy with the food. We will go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett
Erin F.,"Irving, TX",2,19,5,5.0,3/17/2017,"I mean, it's chili's, but the food is fresh and hot, and the waitstaff is great!! We had Ira and Dakota and are loving them! They made this such a great experience.  Also, my husband just spilled his entire beer on me, and they were all beyond nice about it and even comped another beer!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett
Dan A.,"Rowlett, TX",0,3,,4.0,10/8/2017,This is one of the most friendly Chili's around.  TJ our waitress was awesome. She was friendly and fast and kept our tea glass full at all times. We loved the Texas ribs and the chipotle ranch chicken salad that we had. Both of it tastes just right. We'll be back to try more from the new menu that just came out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett
Stefanie L.,"Dallas, TX",2445,953,1686,3.0,2/4/2015,"This is an average Chili's. The place never seems clean, tables are always dirty and service is always very slow. We've made it a habit of sitting in the bar area now as opposed to the regular dining area. The main bartender is very friendly and sometimes gets food out in a decent amount of time. The food is ok here. More often than not the food comes out overly hot or dried out like it's been sitting under a heat lamp too long. It's edible but definitely not great.  We mainly come here because it's close to the softball fields my boyfriends team plays at and it's a place to watch TV and kill time between games. If you're looking for average food, average to poor service and plenty of tv's this is the place for you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett
Lisa S.,"Garland, TX",5,25,2,1.0,3/18/2017,"Manager needs to get a clue!!! We've been here several times in the last 6-8 months, but only because we have been temporarily displaced due to a house fire in August 2016.  We usually frequent the one off of 30 and Broadway/Beltline that's closer to our real home.  This one in Rowlett, where we are staying temporarily, has deplorable service, and I'm being nice.  Employees are not knowledgeable about the menu and have poor customer service skills.  Our waitress had a black eye and was talking to customers about how drunk she was and doesn't remember how she got the black eye the night before.  TMI. I don't care as long as I get good service (which I did not) and decent food, which again, I did not.  The steak was not cooked as ordered and it only came with 5 tiny grilled tomatoes and asparagus was overdone.  The steak itself was more medium to medium well instead of medium rare like I prefer.  I can forgive the steak doneness since I know it's difficult to get it right but poor service and sides are not forgivable.   Our home rebuild will be done in 2 weeks and then we can return to frequenting our regular Chilis at 30/Broadway.   It's interesting how different food quality and service is at same restaurant only 5 miles apart.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett
Mike F.,"Rowlett, TX",0,8,,1.0,8/27/2017,"Tonight we arrived with a party of 7. The hostesses told me it would be a 15 minute wait. I needed a table, we had 5 adults with 2 children.  The center section was completely full. It was obvious that the restaurant did not want to open another area. Wait staff was probably at the point of peak services. I understood, we were ok with it.  When we hit the 20 minute mark, the hostess tried to offer us a split booth. I felt they could have opened 1 table to accommodate us, instead of splitting us up.  So, we left. To the management, we went down the road. That tab was $80 dollars plus. We like Chilis, but I am not going back to The Rowlett location again. To your upper management, Rowlett is growing and there are many restaurants competing for our dining dollars. I spent $130 just this weekend on dining out in Rowlett. I am done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett
Gayle J.,"Garland, TX",11,21,2,4.0,1/9/2017,We sat and watched people being served who had sat after us. 10 minutes in a not busy time. The service is horrible. Many tables not bussed and a manager that is clueless. Walked out. No one cared.  Gave them a second try on 1/9/17. Had much better service in the bar area. Matthew E. was fantastic!!  He was personable and had a wonderful sense of humor. Very attentive and just a great server.  We tried to fill out the Survey on the kiosk thingy but it wouldn't let us. The other couple with us couldn't either.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett
Kelsey H.,"Rowlett, TX",51,4,,5.0,3/22/2017,"One of my favorite places in Rowlett!!! The staff is super awesome, we always love coming in to see Matt who always takes very good care of us!!

Jon A.,"Lakewood, Dallas, TX",29,16,10,1.0,6/4/2017,"hostess is clueless on seating/wait times. the wait time is ridiculous. refills are hard to come by, even when they offer it, they rarely get back with a drink.  they brought out a 6oz steak when I ordered a 10oz. poorest chilis Ive EVER been to.  We won't be going to chili's anymore, Cheddars is now our #1. So long presidente.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett
Johnathan J.,"Plano, TX",0,2,,2.0,12/21/2016,Very poor service and we did a call ahead seating and still had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. The restaurant was not even busy,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett
John H.,"Tyler, TX",11,6,15,1.0,2/13/2017,This is the last time I will ever come to this Chilis.  It took over 30 minutes to get our appetizer out and there were only a hand full of people in the place.  After another 15 minutes he came by to ask for our order but by then we had To go back to work.  As we were waiting two are three people were talking about how long it was taking to get there food.  I'm not going to wast my time ever again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett
David V.,"Dallas, TX",2,11,5,1.0,2/28/2016,"Throughly disappointed all around  I would never in a million years comeback here!!!!! If I could rate this a half a star I would! First there were no booths available, they put us in a table so small a child would have trouble eating on it. Second the queso or should I say burnt bottom of the pot sorry excuse for cheese, was terrible. Third the excuses. One after the other, all of our food came out late and the server was constantly forgetting our drinks and sides, then would come laughing apologizing that she forgot because she's new named Cruz. I ate my whole chicken crispers without a dipping sauce and I told her that I wanted honey mustard and then she brings it when we are done eating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett
Jeff F.,"Forney, TX",0,10,12,5.0,9/24/2016,Our food today was fresh and we loved the new menu options. Ask for Matthew...he's an awesome server. Great overall experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett
Jessica T.,"Rowlett, TX",1,9,,5.0,1/21/2016,"This Chilis has really come far from when we visited it a few years ago. Before, it felt like another Applebee's but now it has its own flavor.  Its a little pricey but still really good.  I love, love, love the waiters and bartender! The waiter was very nice and quick to refill our cups, take our orders and even shot the breeze w/ us for a while and when he would leave and come back, he would pick up the conversation, obviously remembering what we were talking about which made you feel like a valued customer. The bartender was hilarious, randomly breaking out in song and chatting up the guys and girls at the bar, there was amusing banter and lots of smiles, jokes and enjoyment all around. He really lit the place up! There was a lot of people there which surprised me as it was in the middle of the day in the middle of the work week in the rain but the hostess still found a booth that we requested and it was comfortable seating.  The food was a lot better than I remembered and I like that they've broke off from being another Applebee's just with a different name.  We ordered some beer and mixed drinks and they were both really good. I find a lot of places will try to skimp you on the alcohol to stretch the buck so everything is just really watered down but not the case here, it was strong and delicious and I loved it! Good place, nice to see the turn around, will be back in the future!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett
Richard G.,"Rowlett, TX",0,5,,1.0,9/11/2016,"This place used to be the place to be great service great times,Then they remodeled the service went to shit I took my neighbor last week and service was crap I went back today to watch the Cowboys it took me 12 min to get a beer and I had to call a manager for that the restaurant was not even busy I left and asked the only guy in the bar for his autograph thinking he was a celebrity but no it took him 20 min to get his first beer I WILL NEVER BE BACK",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett
Wesley C.,"Plano, TX",50,41,7,1.0,2/9/2016,"I think this is my first one star review, which makes me sad.  Used to love Chili's.  But this visit was all wrong from the start.  Sticky menus and table top to begin the adventure.  The highlight of the meal was the queso.  For the entree, we order a steak meal and a burger.  The steak delivered did not match what was ordered and the burger with fries was warm at best (fries were more cold).  Water ran empty multiple times, and it was not that busy.  Lastly we ordered the Oreo dessert but were told they had been out for a while.  If that's the case maybe make it not orderable on the tablet.  We waited 10 minutes to find out we could not have what we ordered.   So nothing went right this time.  Hopefully it will improve.  But not sure when we will return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett
Ariel R.,"Whitehouse, TX",6,10,,5.0,3/14/2016,"We went to eat dinner at about 5:15, so it wasn't busy. The hostess seemed like she had a bad day but she put on a smile anyway and got us seated at a nice little booth. I also noticed she wasn't rude to any of the impatient people in a large group who were getting impatient. Our server was Mercedes, and she was great. She got our drinks quickly, made sure we had everything we needed, and small talked with us without being annoying or ignoring her other tables. She was quick and between her and the kitchen, everything went great. We both got different kinds of chicken crispers, and both kinds were exactly how we ordered them. We had also ordered Texas cheese fries, which came out with plenty of toppings - no skimping at all and no naked fries! We will definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett
Kevin T.,"Rowlett, TX",0,17,,4.0,3/19/2016,"Chili's has been around so long I tend to forget about it when mulling over places to eat, but that's a bad idea 'cause it's still really good.  They keep re-inventing their menu and it works.  Chicken enchilada soup is delicious!  Go there soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett?start=20
Kayla S.,"Rowlett, TX",0,2,,2.0,8/28/2016,"Not a good location. Our Togo order was clearly not checked very well. When asking for Pico and corn salsa on the side I expected them to be in the box, not completely left out of the order. Also we didn't even get a side of fries at all. Just disappointing that other locations seem to be able to do this job with little effort and this location struggles",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett?start=20
Glenn G.,"Garland, TX",142,26,52,3.0,6/23/2014,"There are 3 Chili's in my immediate area and this one is my least favorite. Most Chilis have taken off of the menu the crispy fried onion strings and jalapenos.. Most of the Chili's will go ahead and make them for you anyway if you ask but not this chili's. I asked someone why they can't serve them anymore and they basically told me ""I just work here "" I'll stick to my normal Chilis on George Bush freeway from now on. Make sure you ask for Jen",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett?start=20
C W.,"Rowlett, TX",0,3,,2.0,1/20/2016,We were regulars each week and could just go into bar area and sit at any open seat but I guess it's new management as now when we go even for the bar everyone must wait for hostess to sit them. There are empty tables that just need to be cleaned but not enough staff to clean them. Some people will still go on and sit themselves while the hostess disappears as  there is an unneeded wait. We may not be going there in the future which is sad as we have grown fond of some of the staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett?start=20
Joe C.,"Rowlett, TX",4,166,97,1.0,5/6/2012,"Oh please help this place....what happened to the good bar tender...he was great...auggg...we ordered two drinks and both...were bad. The first was just wrong. The second which was suppose to be served in a shaker..again..worthless. Last time I ordered these same drinks, they were strong and tasted great!! Today...out of the presidente...I was able to only fill my glass once instead of three times. The food...the buffalo chicken I ordered was cold. So I did not eat it and asked to order a new one. This one was Great...hot etc. But they hit me up with a 7 dollar charge.  At this point..I felt bad for the waiter..he was great..so he got a 10 dollar tip ..40%.

Daren M.,"Rowlett, TX",33,7,3,4.0,8/16/2015,"We are frequent visitors to this location and as always the staff is great. Can I was our server this time around and kept us laughing the entire time.

Jessica A.,"Plano, TX",155,55,2,1.0,1/9/2015,"Don't  ever get food to go. Actually,  just by pass this restaurant all together. Chili's already sucks, but this location takes it to another level.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett?start=20
Gi G.,"Dallas, TX",9,17,1,4.0,11/16/2015,Chili's have came along way from the last time I visited. The downside to my most recent visit was no waiting/ seating area. It was cold on a Friday evening for dinner so I expected a little wait time. It's awkward though when I'm nearly standing in the middle of everyone's way and feel like I'm intruding on others dinner. So finally I spot a seat at the bar and made a mad dash. Ordered my usual water and had the new rib eye tacos. These tacos were loaded with flavor and so much filling inside. I'm impressed with Chili's menu and interior vamp. I'm definitely looking forward to coming back and trying more of the menu. If I can stay away from those delicious tacos first... Probably not.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett?start=20
Zach H.,"Madison, WI",0,5,3,1.0,12/16/2013,"Absolutely disgusting. We walked in with a party of 7 and the restaraunt was mostly empty. Yet they acted distraught at the number of people in our party and took 15 minutes to seat us. Another group of three had to wait as well. The staff was rude and inattentive.  The food was stomach churning. The taco pizza tasted like something you'd get from a gas station. The meat on the pizza, the fajitas and the mango chicken were all overdone, tough and chewy.  The potato skins were frozen.   When we complained to the manager, she was not concerned. We managed to get the taco pizza removed as it was the worst.  Very nasty, run down establishment.  The food is likely to come right back up out of your stomach. STAY AWAY.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett?start=20
Kim B.,"Bedford, TX",138,119,24,4.0,7/15/2014,"Chili's is what it is. The food doesn't change, it's your average American restaurant chain food. The price is very equivalent to the value of the food. I really like this location because of the service. Nicole is a server and a bartender and she's SUPER awesome. Very friendly and remembers me from months ago. Sometimes the service makes up for the average food. It's not terrible food, just know it's not going to be like your momma's cookin'! I suggest going if you just want to sit down, eat a meal and enjoy whomever you are with...and have AWESOME service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett?start=20
Leigh F.,"Cedar Hill, TX",50,228,8,1.0,10/9/2012,"We came by here last night.  So disappointed.  We ordered the beef fajita nachos to share.  I noticed right away that the ""beef"" was gray, like it had been boiled. When I tasted it, it was mushy and didn't have much flavor at all.  Needless to say, the meat was not grilled or even pan seared.  We sent it back and tried the ground beef nachos. A little better but come on. Way too salty. Just nothing special. Chili's used to be SO GOOD. Way too many choices out there these days. We tried to stop somewhere else before coming here but that place was closed on Mondays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett?start=20
Emily S.,"Rowlett, TX",1,12,1,2.0,4/20/2014,"So they this new mini computer thing at the tables now its almost like an electronic menu I think but yih can access a progeam to play trivia cames, ok cool they have this at Nicks too.  But you dont have to pay for it at Nicks.  No where on this device does it talk about you play u pay, your waiter is supposed to tell you this thats what the waiter behind me told his table thats how I found out. Ok so it was only .99 thats not the point no where does it mention u have to pay to play now its not per game its just oncd u start u can  play all u want. You can also u the device to pay ur bill it automatically calculates ur tip, a scale pops up it puts the curser at 20% then you can move the amount up or down  my waiter was hardly at my table at all as it was with this he hardly needs to come at all now so 20% seems like a lot now..

Bill B.,"Dallas, TX",102,580,1772,4.0,7/20/2012,Arrived just before 12Noon and was surprised at how few customers this establishment had. We were seated immediately. The service was very good since they had few to wait on. We all had a luncheon specials from the special menu which was half sandwich and very large salad. The food was good and the prices reasonable. Plenty of parking right at the front  door.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett?start=20
Julian O.,"Garland, TX",18,53,2,1.0,3/20/2011,The menu has a lot of options. All I have to say is they are a Jack of all trades and a master of none. Go somewhere else this place is horrible.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett?start=20
Kim R.,"Rowlett, TX",1,23,,5.0,7/24/2012,"We ordered Chili's Togo. We had a small problem with the order but it was quickly recognized and fixed. The manager was very responsive.

Kate S.,"Allen, TX",1,19,,3.0,8/29/2010,"Lots of options, and the menu changes frequently. I would recommend the burgers and loaded mashed potatoes over anything else. The salads are not your classic salad. The house salad has corn and the caesar contains parmesean cheese slices instead of shreds and the dressing is not very good. The caesar salad is also very peppery. The desserts are good here, and you can make it a cheap date.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett?start=20
Clinton M.,"Rowlett, TX",0,3,,1.0,3/27/2013,"Worst service ever. At least it must be, considering we didn't get any at all! After waiting at the door for a few minutes to get a table, a young brown haired waitress walked by us. Twice. She didn't say a word. We figured that meant seat yourself, so we grabbed a booth by the bar. The overweight bartender ignored us, as did two Hispanic young men. After ten minutes of waiting, a man walked in the front door, sat near us in the bar, and was served a beer. The bartender also gave him a kind greeting. I looked at myself and my husband and thought we were dressed nicely, our hair done, and clean. This didn't go for the rest of the customers. I can't figure out why we were ignored, but I've never been to a place that was slow and had to wait almost thirty minutes until I got frustrated and had to leave. I've worked in the restaurant business too long and know this isn't how it should be. See ya chili's. too bad for you, we came across a bunch of extra cash and were hoping to make someone's day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rowlett?start=20
