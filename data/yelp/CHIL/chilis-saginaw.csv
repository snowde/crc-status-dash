Emma S.,"Saginaw, MI",0,19,,5.0,1/5/2018,"To be honest, my husband and I had no intention on coming to Chili's but the new restaurant next door looked to busy so we settled or so we thought we did!  I have been here numerous times and in the past my experience never warranted really a good or bad review but by the time we finished our meals I laughed about why I would have considered eating at that other place!  Our waiter, Dustin, was probably one of the best waiters I have ever encountered!  Friday night, super busy, and this man took care of us from start to finish and didn't miss a beat!! We both ordered fajitas and really enjoyed them!  I know going forward, when we stop there I will be asking for Dustin and I hope if management reviews the good yelp reviews, he seriously needs to be recognized! Your food is good but he made my night!  Looking forward to my left overs tomorrow!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-saginaw
Denise C.,"Linwood, MI",57,173,1014,4.0,4/3/2017,"First time eating here in 5  years.....we ordered the two for $22....we both got the margarita chicken...it was ok.wish I would of got something different but just couldn't decide. Next time I wanna order the bottomless soup and salad....i like how the menu's are just at the table..i like to be able to browse while waiting for the food. I like all the choices on the kids menu...my daughter ordered pizza and corn on the cob.she really enjoyed the corn.we ordered the berry crumble cake and it was the best part of the meal.the coffee was good and strong and for a refill she brought out a whole new fresh cup I said something along the lines of ""ow"" and she said ""yes we don't do warm ups here,  we only have a Kerig that does it by cups""...doesn't seem very time  efficient?  (but she came back super fast with the coffee? )maybe they don't  sell much coffee?maybe I don't understand kerigs?seems more efficient with pots?  I don't know,  but it was a good cup of Joe. Will be back to try a few more items, get that dessert again,  that's for sure. Still trying to find a restaurant closer than Pontiac that really wows me in every way, this isn't it. also at first I started to worry about the service it seemed to take a bit between drinks and ordering but she showed right up and really stepped up her game (people were coming in this whole time ) I heard her tell the next table she Was just getting there. It was good, she did good as she was really getting busy and it seemed the bar section where we were seated was her section. Bathroom was clean and the bathroom doors were cool.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-saginaw
Glenn M.,"Near North Side, Chicago, IL",0,3,,5.0,4/10/2017,"Great menu, food and service!   Never have had a bad meal at this location.  Will always be at the top of the ""Friday Night"" list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-saginaw
Nick B.,"Saginaw, MI",174,36,197,3.0,10/16/2015,"It was only my second time visiting this location and both times have been pleasant. On this visit, however, it took ten minutes for a server to notice us and take our drink order. Finally, a server came over to help, but it wasn't even her section--she saw us waiting and felt bad. From then on, our meal was excellent. Brittany, our server, started off by apologizing and bringing us chips, and then she hurried off to get us our drinks. I couldn't have been happier with the service after that, and our meals were fantastic.  Next time I visit, I'll definitely be looking for the same server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-saginaw
Mia K.,"Dunedin, FL",68,16,22,4.0,11/15/2014,"Always great food! I get the Crispy Chicken tacos & substitute tempura shrimp and no bacon to make it vegetarian friendly! Always yummy, hot, fresh, & and lots of food! Coupons via text & email are awesome added bonus!  Great place for a date, eat alone, family or a mod-sized group (up to 30 or so). New check out on Kiosk at table is nice & can play games too!  Great place, good drinks, & excellent food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-saginaw
Jamie L.,"Gladwin, MI",0,87,,4.0,2/8/2017,Went with a friend of mine and this was our first experience here and we would go back. Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable.  We really liked all the food except for the Southwestern Eggrolls---they had WAY too much cilantro.  Worth going to.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-saginaw
Fatin A.,"Midland, MI",0,15,6,5.0,6/12/2016,"Great food, great service. What more can u ask for? I wish they would open one in Midland",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-saginaw
Roger T.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,152,,3.0,5/1/2016,"Great food, but I've been coming here since they opened in the early 90's. I swear to God, much of the furniture, tables and outside decor have not been touched since that time. It's LONG overdue for a remodel. Like, tomorrow. What I ordered today, the Baby Back Bonus was great, I don't pay attention to the snobs who don't like chain restaurants. Whatever. But seriously, Chili's corporate, it's time for a remodel. At least touch up the place and add a take-out area. I've been to a modern Chili's in Oklahoma that was recently built and it's beautiful. Build something like that here, ASAP. Unless you're planning to close and never come back, then, well...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-saginaw
Rick R.,"Bay City, MI",16,17,112,5.0,8/20/2014,"Been going to this location for over 20 years. Always great good and service is exceptional.  Particularly like the chips and salsa, and trio appetizers. Also margarita grilled chicken and honey chipotle crispers are good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-saginaw
Sarah T.,"Saginaw, MI",239,23,15,1.0,5/22/2015,"I would give this place zero stars but there's not an option for this. The food is completely nasty. The waitress I had was not only rude, but very pushy. We waited over 40 minutes for our food. Then when we got it it was completely cold. Instead of making a big deal about it to the waitress we just decided we are never ever coming back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-saginaw
Samantha B.,"Macomb, MI",1,18,6,3.0,8/15/2015,"Food was mediocre... Friendly, fast, and clean. Great drinks. Ok prices. Standard chain restaurant expectations",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-saginaw
Deb B.,"Midland, MI",0,5,,1.0,3/15/2015,"Very DIRTY restaurant,  floors filthy, walls appeared to have splattered food on them, and the women's bathroom was filthy. Unsure how it could  remain open, it should be shut down!!! We ordered drinks and left prior to ordering food. yes, we paid for our soft drinks in the stained plastic glasses.  I hope the health department follows up with this place!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-saginaw
R W B.,"Newberry, MI",0,2,2,3.0,3/15/2014,This place looks decent from the road. Entrance is filthy. Table is sticky from previous patron. Menu was worn and wait staff are all sixteen year old girls who don't have a clue about the food. I ordered a strawberry lemonade. It tasted like pool water. This place needs a major rehab. Food was acceptable and that's where the three stars come in. I figure this is a national chain and should be presentable. Disappointed to say the least. Will not be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-saginaw
Scott F.,"Bay City, MI",49,120,7,4.0,8/30/2014,"Great, fast service, food was good. Will be back. My favorite is steak fajitas but opted for a sandwich this time. Tables are a little sticky on the wood area where the the varnish has worn off and I don't care for the tile but that's being really picky.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-saginaw
Jason G.,"Midland Township, MI",6,18,2,5.0,3/29/2014,"Always great food and service at this locale.  Music is never too loud from the bar area.  Can see the TV's to check scores from the booths.  Their chips and salsa are better than most of the Mexican joints in town.  You can never go wrong with the bacon burger.  Lots of burger, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and bacon.  Waitress's are always friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-saginaw
Daniel K.,"Toledo, OH",7,11,,3.0,10/15/2010,Decent food and good service. Nothing to really set it above and warrant 4 or5 stars...it's what you would expect.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-saginaw
