Elaine H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,47,,4.0,10/22/2016,"We arrived in Salina and got checked-in late, so we needed a later-night place to eat. Chili's was one of the few restaurants that was open and still serving. Now, I don't normally eat at large chain restaurants so I'll admit I wasn't particularly excited about this option, but I felt there wasn't much of a choice. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised.  Hands down the best part of our experience was our server Amy. She was sweet and attentive and seemed to truly care that we had an enjoyable experience. The food was good. The atmosphere was lovely without being loud. I had a drink which was excellent (unfortunately, I don't know the bartender's name but my hats off to HER.) And the price - basically $50 for an app, 2 entries, 2 drinks, tax and tip all good with excellent service ?! I consider that a ""win.""  We waited a bit before getting started - but I honestly think that was a fluke due to the odd and late timing in which we arrived (and Amy was super quick to apologize which I appreciate immensely!) I wish there was a way to control the spicy level of the food (I'm not a fan of spicy so a little goes a long way for me.) And I know it's supposed to be a modern convenience and whatnot, but I don't like the touch screen order stands at the table. They seem impersonal and gross to touch. (Call me old fashion.) These last bits are more personal and definitely are more preferences than criticisms, because I'll also definitely be back while I'm here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salina
Danny M.,"Englewood, CO",42,4,,1.0,11/19/2017,Under cooked fajitas.  Vegetables and shrimp were cold and raw.  When we asked them to fix it the manager brought out a 'new' entree which was raw yet again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salina
Michael W.,"San Antonio, TX",168,37,74,2.0,5/24/2017,"One of the worst Chilis that I have ever visited! Floor was dirty, food was unappetizing ! Our appetizer looked as if it had set for an extended period. It was a queso dip and was congealed when it was served.  My hamburger was supposed to have an egg cooked over easy. The first egg was hard and the second one was raw! I will not return to this Chilis!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salina
Melanie B.,"Salina, KS",0,16,3,1.0,8/17/2017,"Love Chilis menu!  Hated the food and service in Salina tonight....rude, condescending waitress and manager who could have cared less.  Won't be back and will share the news with everyone.   Was asked to reach out to Chili's corporate by clicking on a dead link.....hmmmm....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salina
J. M.,"Gypsum, KS",15,3,,1.0,7/18/2017,Waited over 30 minutes for our food. Potatoes were cold & had a glob of yucky paprika on them. We both had the country fried steak. Hubby's was so tough he couldn't eat it; too much pepper on the corn. Manager brought us each a plate of hot mashed potatoes covered with paprika- just what we wanted for dessert-not!  Not inclined to go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salina
January R.,"McKinney, TX",0,3,,2.0,6/29/2017,"I am a huge Chili's fan usually (great variety of yummy options for family dining) but we were so disappointed at this particular Chili's! Kid's pizza was burned, and two adult entrees (chicken crispers and fajitas) were undercooked. Our server, Michelle, was AMAZING throughout it all and apologized profusely. The manager comped our meals, got us replacement meals, and gave us several coupons. When we got our replacement meals, the Southwestern egg rolls were *still* undercooked and not even completely filled. I guess we just assumed that they would give us their highest quality ""replacement"" meals but this one was still poorly done. We travel through Salina several times a year but will unfortunately never return to this Chili's, but the other Chili's in north Texas will still have our business.  ***Chili's corporate*** Based on reviews, it might be time to do some intervention at this site.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salina
Devon B.,"Hoisington, KS",3,34,42,3.0,9/24/2016,Appetizers were fine. Then food came out cold and we have been ignored by the waitress for 10 minutes so far. Still have no refills. Will update as soon as I get a response. So after 15 minutes after our food arrives our server finally comes over and asks if we need boxes. 5 min later the manager comes and offers to make it over comp the kids meals or give us a $25 gift certificate. Really! She finally comped the kids meals and gave us $25 in gift certificates. We never got an apology or I'll take care of it.  Update: We have recently eaten here. Glad to say the experience was much much better. Food came out quickly and was hot. Our waitress was very friendly and checked on us often. I hope it stays this way. We will be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salina
Don E.,"Salina, KS",4,199,8,2.0,1/29/2017,"Went for lunch today. Food was decent. Service was just OK. Had to ask for most everything instead of being asked. Ordered an appetizer and said I would decide on everything else later. After about 15 minutes finally got the servers attention and after ordering she asked if o wanted my entree to come with my appetizer. I said no, keep them separate. Finally got my appetizer after another 15 minutes. Got my entree about 30 minutes later. Had a Plenti rewards card that was supposed to be accepted at all Chilis and would have received 750 points but they wouldn't accept it because ""they are a franchise"". What a load of crap. Most Chilis are worth going to but this is one that I won't see again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salina
A T.,"Dallas, TX",0,2,,1.0,8/8/2017,Worst Chili 's experience ever! One entree took so long that the other diner had already finished by the time it came. Shrimp looked undercooked and we gave up and just ate the pasta it was served with. Steak was very tough. Manager apologized and comped one meal. We will avoid this location in the future.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salina
Krista S.,"San Mateo, CA",4,20,1,5.0,11/25/2016,"Read the review about Amy being such a great server! It's true! She never let our 'ritas go empty! We had the Combo Steak and Seared Shrimp....To Die For! I also asked for fried flour chips and noooo problem! All in all it was a very nice night out and if y o y come, ask for Amys section!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salina
Sarah T.,"San Jose, CA",12,65,10,5.0,4/29/2016,"Was visiting Bethany college in lindsborg from California and stopped here to eat on our way to Nebraska.  My daughter and I must have been hungry because the Food was delicious.  Our Server, Alan was amazing. He knew the menu, refilled our drinks promptly, and brought us to go boxes before we even asked. We were so impressed by the service!  Best quesadilla explosion salad I've had. Tasted better than Cali's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salina
Charlotte G.,"Salina, KS",110,86,101,3.0,9/7/2015,"First of all I have been a fan of Chili's for 10 years or better.  The Salina Chili's does not honor the Chili Rewards Points.  I was told that it is because it is a franchise and not owned by corporate.  Our first issue is that we had to wait when there were easily 10 tables open. We waited about 15 minutes and as we walked to our table we passed 6 open tables. My friend got his order 8 minutes before mine.  No one ever came to tell me what was going on with my order.  My friend waited to eat his burger as it got cold until I got my food.  I finally flagged down our waitress and she was unaware I never got my food.  Another girl eventually brings me my food, but took it to another table first.   Our food was good, but was tepid in temperature.  Our waitress never checked on us again.  She continued to go to the table next to us, but 15 minutes passed before she ever returned. She showed up after the meal. We had to request our drinks to be refilled and she brought back the wrong drink. Our end ticket that was already processed on the table Ziosk was $4 plus over charged. We pointed that out to the waitress and she said she had to correct it on the register. Had we of checked out at the table as they prefer these days we would have just overpaid.  I've never had such poor service. We felt ignored and that it really didn't matter to our wait staff that we had to wait on my meal. Terrible service. It's a shame, because this kind of service could ruin this Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salina
Judy R.,"Kansas City, MO",8,162,763,3.0,3/31/2015,"Great Margaritas,,, ( at 3:07). Terrible service... Not sure if the food is good, they came to take our order when we were ready to leave at 4:12 !!! A long wait and still no food !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salina
Reed N.,"Kansas City, MO",116,1642,121,4.0,6/1/2014,I like Chilis. Yes... they are a chain. But they have some flavorful options and some lighter options if you are into that. I had the Boneless Buffalo Chicken salad. It is a chopped salad and tossed in dressing. The chicken breast is sliced and arranged in a spoke pattern. There was plenty of buffalo sauce on the chicken and the dressing amount in the salad was just right for me. I'd order this item again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salina
Jaime G.,"Salina, KS",11,13,,1.0,6/3/2016,"This Chili's used to be good many years ago (like when they first opened and up to around 2005) I don't know what happened, but they went downhill & never recuperated. I used to like their salads, now they are tiny with less toppings. The to go container is huge, but the lettuce barely covered the bottom. There could have been 3x the salad in there. The chips were way, way over salted. I have given them a third chance (cause I was also disappointed with the second chance I gave them last year,) but won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salina
Jeff L.,"Salina, KS",0,6,2,1.0,10/19/2016,Came here for a quick meal in the bar area and watched the bartender run around like a chicken with its head cut off with no value to the customers.  She kept say I only have 1 pen so for her take the order we had to wait till other customers used the pen to pay their bill.  Buy some pens you would have saved me 20 minutes in my life that was lost over a pen.  Better yet here's a pen.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salina
Mario M.,"Los Angeles, CA",252,3,1,1.0,1/25/2016,The worst bar service ever! Talk about water down drinks slow service with a negative attitude!  No bueno!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salina
Christopher M.,"Beloit, KS",9,19,2,2.0,11/8/2015,"I usually have a fine meal and time here, but a flighty waitress ruined this for me recently. Between forgetting condiments to being on her phone. I was disappointed at best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salina

Ryan H.,"Kansas City, MO",3,47,,3.0,2/6/2016,Who needs a long winded review of Chili's?  It is what it is.  You already know what you're getting into when you see the name.  Good for families looking for a place to dine out where they won't go broke doing so,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salina
Gary B.,"Kansas City, MO",0,3,,1.0,9/22/2016,Probably worst service I have experience in long time.  Took about 1 hour to get food and was under cooked.  I will not be back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salina?start=20
Amber T.,"Salina, KS",18,2,,2.0,6/21/2015,The last time my husband and I ate at Chili's he was served a raw chicken fried steak. I mean bloody red mooing raw. The manager tired to have it remade only to return a overcooked and hard replacement. I feel if the cook is new then they need to be supervised and helped when the rush happens so they don't feel as if they are drowning causing people to recieve raw uncooked food. The waitstaff is not so good they stand around and talk a lot. Haven't gone back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salina?start=20
Jacqueline S.,"Salina, KS",0,4,,5.0,5/29/2016,"Excellent service and food was to die for. Everything was on point, we had a party of 8 and service was prompt, pleasant and delicious.

Me H.,"Seattle, WA",140,928,1020,3.0,6/25/2008,"Day three of the Thelma and Louise ""concur & regulate"" road trip to Dallas and we've been on the road for over 4 hours we were hungry and over fast and unknown food places.  My Louise loves Chili's chicken crispers and so we decided this would be our lunch spot.  Directions off the freeway aren't very clear but eventually we found it.  Note head left than left again. We are seated right away and our server was on top of us like white on rice wanting us to order an appetizer we didn't want.  Two ice teas and a few minutes to look over the menu please.  The ice tea comes and it's warm, I hate that, I want cold ice tea people! Anyways I went for the chipotle honey chicken crispers and my Louise went for the regular chicken crispers both were served with corn on the cob and fries.  After waiting a while our pushy server told us our food would be ready in two minutes, fifteen minutes later it finally arrives at our table with no apology, ice tea is refilled and thankfully it's cold this time. The food was good, I even ate the corn on the cob it was fresh and sweet and tasty.  Service was crappy but the ladies room was much cleaner and nicer than the rest stop restroom we stopped in where I dry heaved in my mouth from the smell, something seriously must have died in there it was nasty. Anyways if I'm ever driving through Salina, pronounced Sa-line-na not with a Mexican accent like I wanted to put on it, there's a 50/50 chance I'd pick Chili's to eat at again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salina?start=20
John M.,"Solomon, KS",11,150,1,5.0,7/21/2013,"I usually got the chicken crispers there, but the burgers are good too, and I have been told the ribs are great. Prepare to wait to be seated on weekends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salina?start=20
