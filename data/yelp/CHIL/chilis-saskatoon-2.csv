Ali W.,"Calgary, Canada",0,4,,5.0,10/19/2016,"I have come here multiple times with family and friends and I have loved the food every time I come! The food has so much flavor and always cooked perfectly. There is a manager working here who has a great personality and eager to tell you about their deals and how you can mix and match and really get the best and most food and save you money. Foods great, staff is great! Really recommend this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-saskatoon-2
Andrea K.,"Saskatoon, Canada",0,2,,1.0,8/23/2017,"We thought we'd try it out. We ordered Sante fe quesadilla, wings, and a burrito. Burrito was by far the best and I'd say it was edible. The quesadilla tasted like chicken and bread. Very bland. It was tiny. The side I ordered did not arrive. My husband had his dips for his wings opened. The foil on the dip was peeled back inside the box of wings. Skip the dishes contacted them to ask about this. They offered an $8 credit. Terrible. Don't bother ordering from here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-saskatoon-2
