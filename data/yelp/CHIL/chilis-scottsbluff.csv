Jordan S.,"Boulder, CO",109,87,246,3.0,4/11/2017,"Took a trip out to Nebraska for work and came across this gem of a chain. From my past experiences they've seem to have stepped up their menu with different choices. Service: I sat at the bar where the service was on par. The bartender regularly filled my iced tea, answered my questions, and checked in with me occasionally. Food: For a chain I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered a house salad that seemed fresh enough. For the main lunch I got the smoked chicken quesadillas with a green roasted aioli sauce. I could actually taste the smokiness of the chicken while the peppers and onions were sautéed well carrying that same flavor. The aioli sauce made the dish much better as I drenched each piece. I'm not a huge fries fan but they were OK. Overall, this is a solid place for a quick lunch but then again, Scottsbluff, Nebraska isn't known to be a foodie town haha.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-scottsbluff
Conrad B.,"Scottsbluff, NE",31,75,430,2.0,3/11/2017,This Chili's has seen some ups and downs since it started. Service is at times amazing and other times not so great. Depends on who you get as a waiter/waitress. The meals are typically fairly priced and there is a lot of good options. Seems to have undergone some recent renovations which I enjoy. Doesn't feel as cramped in the restaurant as it used to.  I like the fajita meal and some of the lighter choices such as the Margarita Grilled Chicken. Appetizers are pretty solid and chips/salsa are very good! The drink options are great too.  This location does have a bar and multiple TV's which typically have sports on. Seats are comfy and restaurant is well maintained. Location is perfect right off Highway 26. Parking is plentiful.  *UPDATE* 12/09/17 Last visit was very unpleasant. Food was bland. Ribs I received were so chewy I had to spit it out. Drinks weren't made well either sadly. Place seems to be going downhill lately.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-scottsbluff
Mike E.,"Scottsbluff, NE",0,1,,2.0,1/1/2018,"I got a gift card for Christmas here so I'd figure I'd give it a shot. Ordered online and when I went to pick it up they informed me they where out of one of the appetizers I had ordered. To their credit, they did offer free chips and salsa. Got home and opened my cheeseburger and they forgot the fries along with the ranch that was suppose to come with the wings. Called the resturant and was informed I could come back for the fries. Other than that there ""wasn't much they could do for me"". Definitely won't be going back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-scottsbluff
Doug C.,"Loveland, CO",0,58,4,2.0,6/17/2017,"Used to be our go to restaurant in Scottsbluff.  But the last 4 or 5 months, something has changed.  Saturday around 430 no hostess to be found...not uncommon recently.  So we wait and finally get acknowledged.  Order chips and salsa.  Waitress comes back and says they are out of chips. How is that possible? Even a run on the restaurant between two and three shouldn't clean you out of chips and salsa.  Bummer.  Wait staff severely understaffed.  Manager was behind bar, helping seat people and greet.  Wait has been so long at the front that people have started seating themselves which I know create havoc for the wait staff.   I really hope the owners can fix this problem as we really enjoy this restaurant. But won't be back anytime soon based on multiple past experiences.   The staff that is there appears to be trying, but it's like plugging one hole and 3 more pop up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-scottsbluff
Scottie H.,"Casa Grande, AZ",0,4,,2.0,9/15/2017,"Normally Chilis is pretty good. Tried this place two weeks in a row. First time the ribs were nasty. Had a Grey look to them and tasted, well like dead meat. Yuck   Sent them back and got something else. By then evening was ruined. Wife was half way done. This next time the waitress, not sure if I should call her that. Just say the person assigned to us. Well she couldn't have been worse if she tried. Told us the food we ordered wasn't available and she threw something together( 4 onion rings on a full size plate)???  Ya I know crazy. Pitiful. Gets better. Food was cold and she never came back with refills.  Should I go on??",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-scottsbluff
Rach Z.,"Grand Island, NE",60,45,8,2.0,3/22/2017,"No.  No.  No.  very understaffed our poor waitress did try very hard and the drinks were cold and delicious but the food was bad.  Our appetizer was white queso dip and it took 30 minutes and not white at all. It was as actually very Velveeta  yellow and they cooked guacamole into it.  Hot seared brown guac was a first for me.  Food came immediately after our appetizer; my husband got a burger with cold pre-cooked bacon and the burger that was cooked until every ounce of moisture was gone.  I got the chicken quesadilla which lacked the peppers, onions, jalapeños, and aioli.  It was literally only chicken and cheese that was so greasy you couldn't pick it up and the tortillas were somehow still underdone.  The salad was warm and wilted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-scottsbluff
Teressa W.,"San Diego, CA",145,101,283,4.0,6/13/2017,"Every time we go to Torrington, we drive to Scottsbluff and eat here. The staff is always wonderful and we sit right away. The food is fast. They have burritos now, which I didn't realize- and they are wonderful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-scottsbluff
Keith B.,"Lawrence, KS",25,2,,2.0,6/21/2017,"Food was ok service was bad, waiter wrote stuff down by we never received it. He also apologized for being a bad waiter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-scottsbluff
Liz A.,"Frisco, TX",0,3,,1.0,7/18/2017,"Stopped by on Sunday, July 16th about 12:40.  My husband & I sat at the bar and we left without being acknowledged or served.  I thought I must have been invisible - two other groups of people came in and sat at the bar after us and were acknowledged with orders taken.  We sat & sat - the female bartender kept on about her business.  We have been here before with slow service but, this was completely unacceptable.  Not enough staff / underwhelming to say the least.  Chili's in other cities I've experienced much better service.  Applebee's seem to be better in Scottsbluff...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-scottsbluff
Marc B.,"Scottsbluff, NE",31,9,89,3.0,1/8/2017,Ehh! Not impressed... Ive ate at other chilies in bigger city's and this one sucks by comparison!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-scottsbluff
Jennifer B.,"Denver, CO",1024,1320,1786,3.0,8/27/2013,"When in Scottsbluff, NE, choices for food are limited and i find that there are no truly great options. Chili's is adequate for dinner on the road.  HH all day brings them up a bit in my book.  Two drinks during HH and a salad to go satisfies me nicely.  They offer consistent food, nothing fancy just all American classics with a few twists here and there.   Not my destination of choice but when in a rural area like this, it's the best option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-scottsbluff
Serena B.,"Mineral Wells, TX",41,48,34,3.0,4/26/2016,I love the small town feel of this Chili's.  I love the staff.  The food tastes just like all the locations I have visited.  My only complaint... I am a regular and I collect points on the new zoosks system they use.  But since our current job relocation this is our new chili's.. but they are the ONLY chili's I have ever been to where can't use or accumulate points.  I'm so disappointed since our autistic son chooses chili's to eat all the time and now points go to waste.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-scottsbluff
Jim H.,"Dunnellon, FL",0,4,,1.0,7/19/2016,"I've eaten here a couple times when traveling for business, with no real problems except that they don't participate in the rewards program.  Today, however, was a much different experience. I was quickly seated then waited almost 20 minutes. None of the wait staff showed up. I asked the hostess about it, she said she'd get someone. Five more minutes pass, still no one shows up. During my wait, I watched a couple come in, then leave without anyone acknowledging they were there. Finally, I decided they didn't want my business, so I left. I Called the manager and he was apologetic. This is not what I expect from my favorite chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-scottsbluff
Danny B.,"Lusk, WY",113,280,181,1.0,1/15/2014,"Well starting off pretty good with blackberry margaritas and a free sample of the pineapple,blueberry margaritas. The main dish chicken and beef enchiladas were nothing that brought you a wow factor. The rice and black beans were also there but again nothing to set them apart from any other fast food place. Should most likely drank supper. Stay with the burgers and other entrees. We did have good service how ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-scottsbluff
Barry H.,"Mitchell, NE",53,27,3,3.0,11/7/2014,"Busy Friday night,  our waiter was flustered and had few people skills.  Ordered thier new Tex-mex  top shelf chicken enchiladas..tasted like frozen grocery store meal.  Very disappointed.  Will stick to burgers from now on",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-scottsbluff
Shane Z.,"Willard, UT",56,340,48,3.0,3/18/2014,I can't complain too much about a chain restaurant.  I had their salad for lunch and it is pretty hard to mess up.  Service was quick and polite.  My salad tasted as expected. Great for a quick lunch when you are working.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-scottsbluff
Mike S.,"Fort Morgan, CO",0,55,,3.0,4/10/2016,"It's OK for Chill's.  I will say the place is clean.  The food is typical of Chill's.  The service was OK, not bad not great.  One of the better stops in Scottsbluff, which is limited.  They try hard, it's just not that wonderful of food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-scottsbluff
Lana C.,"Toluca Lake, CA",71,23,3,5.0,10/7/2015,"Driving from MI to CA, we stopped to visit my sister in her tiny town! Had a large group with ROWDY peeps, me being the ringleader! ""Amber"" waited on us; we were loud, talking over each other, needy, asking and demanding. Boys (9 and 13) wanted crayons, bbq sauce, napkins, dessert, etc. We were impossible and Amber just SHINED: SWEEEEEEEET, cheerful, knowledgable, professional, fast, etc. I wait tables so I know good service and she was as good as ANY fine-dining place. Another girl brought the dessert and helped out a couple times and was really awesome too. Food was pretty good. Good choices. But GREAT service MADE IT!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-scottsbluff
Amy S.,"Johnson City, TN",0,54,,3.0,12/22/2015,"It was okay, nothing special, but edible. We ordered an appetizer and asked for it to come out first. It came out after our dinner, I always hate that. Maybe that is just me but I even asked for it to come first, got a lame apology about the kitchen but that's all. Food was just okay, what I expected, nothing too Wow, but good. I hate the kiosk things on the table. I much prefer a person. The waitress insisted that I used it to pay my bill.  I am very computer literate, I just done want an ugly computer on my table!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-scottsbluff

Jazmin H.,"Scottsbluff, NE",0,1,,2.0,2/27/2015,"I tried the chili's to go. Placed my order 5:50 I got the confirmation and told the time it would be done was at 6:27. I got in and paid for my food at 6:34, I didn't get my food till 7. I wasn't impressed at all. The guy Jacob was very nice and apologized.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-scottsbluff?start=20

Wendi N.,"Scottsbluff, NE",7,3,1,3.0,7/24/2014,"I was here with my hubby for a rare lunch date. We had excellent service. Good burger. Had an issue with the salad but the manager took care of it right away (tossed it all out - haha) .

Cheri K.,"Lincoln, NE",8,10,2,3.0,3/25/2015,"Picked up lunch to go and it was just okay.  Got the quesadilla (steak), and the flavor was good, but the beef was so tough I couldn't chew much of it.  Again, if they were a little more careful about the meat, this would be a four or five star rating.  I also got some chips and salsa, and the chips were brown/overcooked.  They had a burnt taste that really interfered with the flavor.  I try this place every time I am in town, and they are pretty consistent, but as Chili's go, it is way below par.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-scottsbluff?start=20
Maggie F.,"El Mirage, AZ",894,388,125,3.0,4/25/2011,"A Chili's in Scottsbluff is exactly the same as a Chili's anywhere else, & sometimes that's a good thing! I love their fajitas, always sizzling & the southwestern egg rolls are always yummy.  You can't beat their operation hours. They were even open on Easter Sunday, which I found is not a common thing in this area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-scottsbluff?start=20
