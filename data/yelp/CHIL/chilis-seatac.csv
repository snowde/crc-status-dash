Small but has booths and seating at the bar both have food options. Friendly bartender he will ask where you are traveling too?  If you buy a beer (two sizes) get a shot for $5.00 at the bar but know before tip it will be about $16.00.

Samantha S.,"Middle Grove, NY",40,27,75,5.0,6/11/2016,"For WHAT IT IS (an express, sit down restaurant in an airport)? 5 stars. Here's why: My waitress was delightful and smiled the whole time; but not fake sweet.  I was sat within minutes and had coffee very soon thereafter.  The hostess was constantly wiping things down and being attentive.  My food was EXACTLY as ordered: scrambled eggs, toast, home fries and bacon for approximately $10.59. Plus, coffee was hot and tasted fine.  This morning, my expectations were not only met but exceeded by the staff and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seatac
John C.,"Tacoma, WA",27,5,,2.0,12/19/2016,"The food was mediocre. As an avid chillis fan, I was expecting  at least decent, warm food. Instead I got a plate of cold eggs, cold toast and potatoes that felt like they had been left under a warmer for an hour. Not a single piece of food on my plate was above lukewarm.  While I was eating, one member of the staff yelled ""*Insert name here* COME DO YOUR JOB!"" The employee then walked to the front and proceeded to inform the customer ""Sorry, my wait staff is lazy.""  My waiter was great although it was a short stay.  Overall, the food was mediocre and the service was poor. For a $16 plate of eggs and potatoes, at least deliver warm food and don't insult your co-workers in front of customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seatac

Nick B.,"Palmdale, CA",0,9,1,1.0,6/24/2016,"Terrible. Chili's should be ashamed of the level of service provided to their customers.  I've sat at the bar for 15 minutes, not a single person at this bar has a drink in front of them, and the bartender is fumbling around lost.  I haven't seen anyone even order a beverage yet. Perhaps it's a staff training issue, a manning issue, or a competency issue but customers should not be asked to bear the brunt of any of those problems. I can't wait until the food shows up.  From what I can see of the kitchen, I'm keeping my expectations low.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seatac

But this place was actually decent, especially since it was directly across from my gate. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich (chicken breast with applewood smoked bacon, fresh sliced tomato, lettuce, Swiss cheese & honey-mustard) and it was tastier than I expected. The fries were a little overcooked, though. The guy next to me got chips and salsa.  Were those complimentary?  If so, why didn't I get any? Whatever.  I had to catch a flight.

Two others sat near me in the bar area and the mgr helped and got their drink orders but not mine...he just got me a menu and said someone would be with me soon.  They did not and I bounced.

Laura F.,"Bellevue, WA",102,104,45,4.0,6/24/2015,"I've come to expect not-so-great airport food, so this Chili's was a pleasant surprise. I ordered off the ""lighter entree"" menu (Thank you Chili's!) - mango salsa chicken, which came with cilantro rice and broccoli. The chicken was well cooked and juicy. The kids menu was good as well. I really appreciate that you could substitute broccoli for fries (thankfully my kid likes broccoli). The lunch felt very healthy and well balanced. The best part was how quickly our food was served. Service was prompt and polite. We were in and out in 30 minutes, which is great for an airport location.

Chris U.,"Keller, TX",60,162,149,2.0,2/26/2016,When you eat here you risk missing your flight. And it doesn't matter how much time you think you have. I'm confident they can make you miss it. In all seriousness I think you need to be here 1 HR before your flight so if you get held up at security look else where.  Food is so-so. Took 5 min to get seat with half the tables open. Some people waited up to 15min after I got seated.  Then took 10 min to get my drink order ordered.  Which luckily I was ready to order food.  I'm currently waiting for the food.  I've eaten here before so I know the food quality and I know what to expect. For airport food it's ok (only ever had the breakfast) The bacon is so thin that I now get the sausage.

Lindsey V.,"Miami, FL",6,15,5,1.0,8/3/2016,They get 1 star for getting my food out to me quickly. Chilis is my favorite restaurant and I've eaten the original chicken crispers a million times. Their chicken crispers are just chicken fingers. They tasted like something you would find at a ball park or the freezer section at the grocery store. Wasn't expecting something like that or I wouldn't have ordered it. Not the same at all. The broccoli it came with was steamed probably for 30 seconds. Very hard and unseasoned. Not impressed.

Justin S.,"Bakersfield, CA",28,41,25,1.0,8/12/2016,"This place needs needs new management and employees who know how to multitask.  This by far was the worst Chili's I have ever dined at. They also don't honor the Chili's email offers or Chili's rewards. First off, the greeter seemed way overworked and apparently was also required to buss tables, so she couldn't keep up with the front counter customers as well as handling to-go orders. After being sat at a semi clean table, we waited for about 10 min before anyone came by. The waitress was busy and appeared to only be able to handle only one table at a time. Thinking it would speed up our order, we were gave our complete order so we could make our flight on time. We received our chips and salsa and drinks fairly quick but things turned bad after. Waited another 15 min before our other apps came out, which was only soups and only got 2 of the 3 ordered. Our main course came our about 15 min after that. It was pretty difficult to even get some drink refills. I understand why they have a quick menu but food was taking way to long to come out.  Unless you have a couple hours between flights, and enjoy waiting, I would suggest to skip this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seatac?start=20

If you don't have at least an hour before boarding begins, I'd skip this one and eat somewhere else.  If you have the time, it's not a bad option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seatac?start=20

Keisha R.,"Atlanta, GA",20,178,181,3.0,6/16/2016,"Very busy spot, understaffed. Only saw two waitresses serving the whole place and every seat was filled. The menu is extremely limited here: limited appetizers, no spinach dip, no Trio option, expensive entrees compared to regular Chili's restaurants. Ordered the boneless buffalo wings and they were a bit burned, barely any buffalo sauce tossed in, had to settle for ranch since they were out of bleu cheese. Disappointing meal that took too long to come out but understandable considering the amount of patrons ahead of me. Perhaps something management can work on in the future (staffing).

The ""best"" option was Alaskan Amber.  Said beers are very expensive. After tax and a decent tip, my big beer was $12.

Bradley S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",28,7,3,1.0,1/23/2015,"This Chili's is definitely the best Chili's within 50 feet of gate D7. So it has that going for it.  Since it is located in the airport, and a far trek from competition with Starbucks and McDonald's, the restaurant essentially has a captive audience.

Jennifer N.,"Seattle, WA",480,700,37,1.0,2/19/2014,"This was, by far, the worst Chili's I've ever been to.  Main reason - THEY SERVED ME FOOD ON PAPER PLATES!  I'm sorry I was at a sit down restaurant correct?  It was absurd and it made me unhappy.  I have eaten at many other Chilis in other airports, as well as Fridays and other airport establishments, and they use actual plates and cutlery. The service was also abysmal.  Max there were 5 other people there, and we sat for about 10 minutes after we were completely done with our food before I was able to flag down the waitress to bring us our check.  Maybe outside of an airport this works, but we have flights to catch!  Gotta be on top of these things. As far as the food goes, it was fine.  We were there for breakfast.  I had eggs and pancakes.  It was nothing special and the sour taste in my mouth from the other problems far outweighed my minor satisfaction with the food. I wouldn't recommend going here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seatac?start=20
L H.,"Chandler, AZ",0,10,,1.0,12/27/2015,Worst service ever!  They basically ignore you.  I actually had to put my arm out to stop a waiter to get our bill.  When I asked about ordering dessert they told me they didn't know anything about the deserts and to ask the bar tender.  It's almost like they went out of there way to ignore us!  Very strange!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seatac?start=20

Tery T.,"Monterey Park, CA",4,3,,1.0,7/20/2013,"I almost NEVER write reviews, but the service here was soooo bad that I just had to. So my husband and I were trying to grab a meal before our flight home, we saw Chil's Too and thought it was a good idea. WRONG!!!. First off, there were this family ahead of us and wanted a table, but the hostess (which he was also a server) kept trying to tell the family to sit at the bar table that faces the terminal seating. So the family said, no..we'll wait for a table. Then the hostess goes..'ugh fine"". Then it was our turn and we got seated to a table fairly quickly, but of course, without menus. So a waiter walks by with menus from another table that he just took orders from..I stopped him and nicely asked if we can have some menus. He puts them on the table and walks away. He walks by me again and I politely ask ""excuse me, can we order?"" and he rudely puts up his index finger at me and said..""I'm not ready for you!"" Even the customer sitting at another table gave a look at what happened. Mind you, it was not busy...we saw other waiters just literally standing around and picking their nails.  So instead of sitting through the rudeness and risking the chance of them spitting in our food..we lugged our luggage and ate somewhere else where they were nice and understands that people have a flight to catch. Note to self: make sure you eat before going to the airport.  Good job, Chiil's Too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seatac?start=40
Becky W.,"Riverside, CA",123,55,144,2.0,1/11/2012,I ordered the breakfast tacos and I wish I would have ordered something else. They were very watery which I wasn't sure if it was the eggs not cooked enough or the too much salsa poured on top. The service on the other hand was excellent. Very fast and super friendly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seatac?start=40
