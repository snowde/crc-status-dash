Steven B.,"Orlando, FL",4380,1179,825,2.0,12/25/2015,"It was the night before Christmas and all through the house....... Actually it was 5:00 PM and my party of two blew in here for a quick bite.  The place was about 50% full.  The ATMOSPHERE was standard Chili's with no surprises. The adult libations were a surprise.  Our waitress explained that many drinks were 2 for 1 all the time!  This was true of my house margarita and my dining partners white zin.  Nice! Speaking of nice, that was also true of our waitress.  She was excellent so CUSTOMER SERVICE was no problem. The reason they do 2 for 1 drinks is to make up for the deplorable FOOD.  I ordered a 6 oz. steak with mashed and broccoli as sides.  The steak was indeed cooked to order but tough and lacking flavor.  The mashed potatoes were an almost inedible pasty lump.  The broccoli was fine.  I ordered two more margaritas to kill the pain. The 2 for 1 drinks is a good deal. I might be persuaded to stop in again just for alcohol and appetizers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sebring-4
Heather G.,"Sebring, FL",1,11,,1.0,4/9/2017,"I got curb side here yesterday and among their sins: 1) Gave me the wrong salad dressing for my salad 2) no napkins or eating utensils, which I discovered when I got to my destination and sat down to eat, so had to make a trip to frigging BUY utensils and paper towels that should have come with my food! This was supposed to be a treat for myself, considering how much they charge. From now on I'll go to the fast food taco place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sebring-4
Sharon M.,"Fort Myers, FL",54,14,,1.0,8/27/2017,"After waiting 20 minutes when told the wait was 5-10, we were seated and water was served and order was taken. After waiting 55 minutes, no food, no waitress in sight, we left and spoke to the manager who said they had a ""kitchen malfunction"". However after reading other reviews, it's obvious that this place has a problem. Too bad zero stars is not an option. Don't waste your time going there!'",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sebring-4
Scooter B.,"Cape Coral, FL",18,179,294,1.0,9/21/2016,"What did I expect from a national chain.  Let me begin first with the good; our waitress was very nice.  Now the less stunning moments:  the floor under our table was dirty.  Many restaurants actually sweep up the detritus between customers.  We ordered the queso and it arrived quickly.   Our entrees were apparently being held hostage in the kitchen.  Others around us were happily served and tucked into their baskets and bowls of yummies.  Meanwhile, we scraped the queso skillet until there wasn't a smidgeon left.  We were considering licking the skillet when our waitress happened by and we asked if our entrees were possibly being prepared.  Oh, yes!!! I will bring them out, she said.  Gee, thanks, we thought.  I ordered a beef tostada and chicken and sour cream enchilada.  I could have tastier Mexican food at that other taco chain.  The one with ""taco"" in their name.  My dining companion ordered a small salad and a bowl of chili.  The chili was too spicy, but that's subjective.  The salad had the wrong salad dressing.  We paid using the nifty non-human tablet thingy conveniently located at each table.  The machine did not print a receipt.  The waitress was kind enough to print one for me at another register.  This was a disappointing lunch and I don't think we'll be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sebring-4
Eddie B.,"Miami, FL",0,42,48,1.0,3/25/2017,GROSS!!!! NASTY!!! This Chili's is a DIRTY DINING EPISODE!!!!! This location has gone down the drain!!! We had to send back our food the ribs were COLD & smothered in a disgusting BBQ sauce.  The county health inspectors should visit this Chili's & shut it down!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sebring-4
Nikky M.,"Hollywood, FL",0,8,5,1.0,6/12/2017,"Where do I begin? After a long road trip around Florida, we were hungry for a quick bite. Once arrived at our local Chili's, we were greeted & was told to wait while the staff cleaned a table. Welp, 15min later no one came back. We asked once again, and finally found a waiter to help. Our waiter was nice, but the service was pretty terrible. We originally ordered 2 for 1 drinks & realized they had a special on Presidente Margarita's, so we switched our orders before they were placed. The waiter was totally confused, brought out wrong drinks & then tried to make us purchase them- even though we did not drink any of it. As the night goes on, I realized the Presidente margaritas came with 2 per meal we requested. I asked about my 2nd one and the gentleman told me no, my 2nd drink was included in the blue shaker. I was a bit surprised to hear because my friends both received two margaritas (not the 2 for one's). At this point, I was over the mistakes- we didn't receive silverware, didn't have napkins, our table was filled with dirty plates & empty cups. Our food came out at different times & each order was incorrect. The restaurant wasn't even busy. I wonder if the gentleman waiting on us was on something? It was a complete disaster. Finally, by the time our checks came in, naturally, it was incorrect. We were two couples & our bills were split into 3. Why? Also, they over billed us about $60. As for the cherry on top, expressed our concern to two different managers & they were on another page. I wasn't looking for compensation, simply providing feedback where it's due. I'd rather stop by a fast food joint instead of dropping by Chili's. I'm sorry but they did not seem to care whatsoever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sebring-4
Edward C.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,14,5,5.0,2/10/2017,"What a jewel in Sebring!!  Friendly folks. Cold beer. Good food. Now I know you thinking ""it's just a Chili's""... but what ever this restaurant is doing it is the primo of Chili's. I've rediscovered the great baby back rubs. The Caribbean salad is so fresh. And their burgers are always good. Did I mention the friendly staff?  Come on down. You won't be disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sebring-4
Randi F.,"Sebring, FL",0,1,,1.0,8/8/2017,"I only gave one star because zero was not an option. Recently visited, and sat for over 10 minutes without a server coming to us. Other tables that had come after had been served already. Got up, found the host who assured me the waitress would be right over. Another ten minutes go by. We left and spent our money at Codys. I'm not going to beg for attention in a business that clearly doesn't give a damn about their customers",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sebring-4
Leah E.,"Ruckersville, VA",0,1,,1.0,7/11/2017,The service was ok however the food was mot prepared well my salad came out and didn't have all the ingredients on it had to ask for my avocado and tortilla strips my granddaughter mac and cheese came put and her fries came 7 minutes later not a good experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sebring-4
Michi D.,"Lake Wales, FL",50,19,13,5.0,6/16/2016,Waitress was very fast and cautious. And on the top of her game! Drinks are on point! Bar has got the major ball games on. And people are just relaxing just like me. Sit at the bar it's best.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sebring-4
M D.,"Lake Placid, FL",0,8,,2.0,5/20/2017,"The food is mediocre at best, the service was terrible and it was so cold in the restaurant we were shivering trying to eat. This please for dinner is a total joke, it took almost 2 hours for a crappy experience! The bar area seems to be the only place that you have a half way decent chance of having an experience you don't mind paying for... go somewhere else!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sebring-4
LA N.,"Sebring, FL",4,8,2,1.0,3/23/2016,Filthy. This place needs to be shut down or renovated. There is always food and random napkins on the floor. Service is crap. I went into the bathroom and both toilets were clogged. There were no hand towels and the soap dispenser was empty. I will not be returning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sebring-4
Patrick C.,"Lake Placid, FL",1,16,2,1.0,11/29/2016,"I have always liked Chili's until I visited the one in Sebring.  You think ""its Chili's, how can you go wrong?""  Let me paint you a picture... Open the door and walk in, you are immediately met with the stench of an old dirty, moldy wet mop.  Then you slide across the floor to your table on a thin layer of grease as if you were skating on an icy pond. Go ahead, dare to look down and see the FILTH on that tile floor and forget that nasty grout.  GROSS!  With each step you can hear the soles of your shoes struggling to lift off the sticky, greasy floor. If you haven't done an about face yet, have a seat at the bar or a table and while you wait you can carve your initials in the sticky gew from the dirty water and rag that last wiped down the eating surface you are about to dine on.  Don't dare to take a peek into the kitchen.  I've seen cleaner subway stations in NYC.  And that was just a peek on my way to the mens room.  I just couldn't get myself to order.  Thanks, but no thanks Highlands County Chili's.  You may get away with this with some of the locals but not if they know better.  CLEAN UP YOUR DAMN ACT!  GROSS!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sebring-4
Erin S.,"St Petersburg, FL",48,144,104,2.0,9/18/2013,"Okay I was totally planning on giving Chilis 3 stars. I like Chilis. I like their food. Plain and simple. However, this was visit was slightly annoying. And by slightly, I mean very.  To be honest, our entire visit went well. We were seated right away and then seen by our server right away. Chilis has a pretty good deal going on right now. For. $35 you get an appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 movie tickets, so we decided to do that. I asked the server what appetizer was best and he suggested the flat bread. He then proceeded to tell me I could order any flatbread I wanted...not just the two listed under the separate menu. Awesome. We also ordered our entrees with no issues. Our food came out quickly and it was good..no complaints..until I got the bill.  On the bill I noticed I was charged an extra $1.49 for the flatbread and an extra .50 cents for the sweet potato fries I had. I got a menu and started looking it over. Sure enough, next to the sweet potato fries it said ""add .50 cents). Okay, that's my bad, I just can't read apparently. Then I start looking for somewhere that talks about an up charge for the flatbread. I about turned that menu upside down and found nothing. Meanwhile, our waiter was no where to be found, so I called over another waitress and explained the situation and she said she would get the manager.  This is what really ticks me off. So the manager comes over and I explain what happened. He proceeds to tell me that the flatbreads are an up charge because they're more expensive to make, than say the chips and salsa. Okay I get that. But I tell him that I wasn't warned. I tell him that I can't find it on the menu and that my waiter didn't warn me. The manager says ""oh well that's because it's not on the menu."" What? How in the heck am I supposed to know about an up charge if its not on the menu. Okay, whatever. Now I know. But then he goes on to say ""I'll take it off this one time for you, but next time, you need to be more inquisitive and responsible."" What?!?!?!? No. You will fix my bill every time you and your staff are incompetent and don't do your job. I will pay an up charge for something if it was my fault, say for not reading the menu correctly. I honestly hate being ""that lady"" at a restaurant who makes waves and I know $1.49 is menial. However, there is a thing called customer service and I appreciate a restaurant that provides good customer service; not a restaurant that basically threatens you to be more responsible and acts like they're doing you a favor, when in fact they provided the disservice in the first place. Honestly Chilies, get it together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sebring-4
D H.,"Avon Park, FL",0,25,11,3.0,3/10/2016,"Yes, another corporate restaurant. The reason for only 3 stars was the service. Very apparent that they didn't put enough servers on at 3:00 pm. Clearly not my waitress' fault. She had 1 whole section and the bar, not to mention she was also the bartender. Food was average. I asked for medium cooked burger, it was very well done, fries were extremely salty. Other than that all the other food was good",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sebring-4
Arlen R.,"Miami, FL",0,5,,1.0,7/5/2016,"the WORST! bad service, food, the floor was sticky and filthy, my menu was full of grease and sticky on every page  silverware was dirty to boot!! go somewhere else :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sebring-4

Thomas C.,"Sebring, FL",0,14,,1.0,5/7/2014,"The food was standard Chili's fare once it finally made it to the table, which took well over an hour.  The food actually raised my rating from a zero to a one star. This was, without a doubt, the worst service I've ever received in any establishment. It was graduation night at the local college, and the manager told me he didn't know about it and had very little staff scheduled.  Isn't it the manager's responsibility to know what is going on in his community so he can staff appropriately? Last night was my last visit to this Chili's location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sebring-4
Makena K.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",35,101,558,1.0,6/5/2011,"Horrible!!!  Will not go back.  My husband is a strict pescatarian and ordered the shrimp quesadilla salad.  They brought him chicken quesadilla salad instead.  The manager looked at him in the eye and told him that they will make an entirely new salad. The salad came and hubby started to eat ... and lo and behold a slice of grilled chicken.  What the --- recycled food?!!! On the same visit, I ordered a black bean burger.  My burger was SOoooOO burnt, I couldn't even cut it with a knife. We came 2 hours before closing time.  This was Chili's last  chance to redeem themselves. We have had several horrid experiences here. But since there are only  a handful of choices in Sebring to dine in, we keep giving this terrible restaurant chances.  But SAFE TO Say we will NEVER spend a dime of our hard earned money here...EVER!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sebring-4

Nathan C.,"Castle Rock, CO",11,20,5,2.0,1/27/2011,Food gets a...well I cant rate the food as it's not here yet...it's been nearly 40 minutes since we ordered so I guess that explains the service. Turns out that our waitress forgot to put our order in. When the food finally arrived it was good. The manager comped our whole table lunch which is why this is 2 stars instead of a solo star. Gotta respect a place that knows when they mess up bad and responds appropriately.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sebring-4?start=20
Steve M.,"Lake Placid, FL",62,418,96,2.0,3/9/2012,Service still a serious issue here and guess they don't read reviews or just don;t care. Our waitress was more interested in chatting to the other staff or cleaning her station so she could leave. Had to keep trying to get her attention for needs. Food took some time and came out incomplete. Had to wait for some time before we got her atention to be able to fix things. Too many other options available for this to continue.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sebring-4?start=20
Bill B.,"Sebring, FL",0,135,1,1.0,10/31/2013,"I arrived at 11:00 a.m. the floor was just mopped and super wet, thought I might fall. Stupid to use that much water, just before opening. I had a birthday free appetizer. Ordered the onion rings, I told her bring them out first we will order later. There was no one in the rest. My rings came out cold sent them back. I then ordered, she brought the soup out right away before rings. Then the food came and later on the rings. So what do you want to get cold first. Rings stink when there cold. The burger bites sucked. The rings were not what they used to be, besides there actually off the menu. I gave waitress the coupon and she came back and said you have to buy a full meal not the lunch menu. I said I get promotions every week and have done so for years. No luck, happy birthday to me. Had to take a tums later in the day. The food went down hill and I am never going back. Checkers has better food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sebring-4?start=20

Brian K.,"Okemos, MI",3,28,,1.0,11/18/2010,"Unbelievably bad. Uncontested champion for worst service in Sebring, a place where people aren't exactly renowned for their drive and ambition to begin with. I didn't think it was possible for Chili's to screw up their pre-fab food. This one finds a way, apparently as an extension of their open hostility towards their patrons. I've now been here four, yes four miserable times (the last two not of my own will) and the experience has always been identical. If you insist on casual dining in this part of town, Outback is literally next door and considerably better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sebring-4?start=20
Jimmy M.,"Duette, FL",0,38,,2.0,6/15/2013,The food was average for Chili's. I was prepaired as advertised and good. The server was disorganized and slow.
