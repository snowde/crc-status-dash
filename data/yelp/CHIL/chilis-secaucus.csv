Rohit G.,"Maywood, NJ",40,126,229,3.0,12/18/2017,As you all know it is a chain restaurant with plenty of choices and drinks. But what makes this visit special is our server Jonathan. He is the kind of person that makes you feel important and cares for even it is chain/ fast food place. I wish some how Chili's can use his skills to train rest of the staff and make them kick ass. 5 STARS FOR HIS IMPECCABLE SERVICE!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus
Sheena D.,"Belleville, NJ",83,36,2,3.0,12/18/2017,"The service wasn't bad. Gentlemen greeted us very courteous. Food was pretty good, the need some better fries though. Overcooked and dry. The drinks weren't great, pretty much all juice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus
Andrew L.,"Fort Lee, NJ",42,107,134,3.0,10/27/2016,"I'd try to give it 3.5 stars (see why below). I was on the fence about this spot. I haven't been to Chili's in maybe 5 years, and oddly enough it was this exact location. But I had heard good things about the franchise as of late so we decided to stop by for a late dinner since we were at the expo center earlier. The pros and cons were on & off all night. The restaurant wasn't busy but we still got seated too close (chairs were literally back to back) to another table. The service was slow but when our server was around, we felt like we were getting good attention. But we never got refills and I suspect she left for the day near the end because someone else came to clear our plates and give us the check. No one ever came to take our payment (had to switch from card to cash & leaving). Extra 1/2 star for the manager trying to make things right with our meal. We ordered shrimp tacos but got chicken tacos instead for whatever reason. He was very apologetic & understanding, even took the value off the final bill. The food itself was good - actually a lot better than I remember! And our dessert (molten chocolate cake) was perfect... Moist cake with nicely melty insides. But like I said, service was almost non-existent and we waited for a good 5-6 minutes and couldn't even find someone to take our money. If you're not in a hurry, it may not be a problem for you. Food was still good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus

Keigo I.,"West New York, NJ",5,94,189,3.0,1/26/2017,"This restaurant is always crowded on weekends. Not quite huge floor and many tables.

I visited three weeks ago with a friend, I screwed up on movie times (AMC theater across the street) so we had a few minutes to kill. I walked in and almost immediately turned right back out. This place was filthy. Scraps along the floor and a dirty bar. The garbage was visible and piled sky high, it really grossed me out. I had to use the ladies room, which was probably cleaner than front of house--imagine! Left out immediately after use of b/r. Walked out to napkins and a hair tie on the ground.

Danan R.,"New York, NY",813,1698,31,2.0,9/17/2016,"Just barely passable.  The service was spotty and we had to flag down our server several times.  The food itself has deteriorated in quality.  This was my first time back at Chili's in over 5 years and the quality has definitely gone downhill.   A recap: 1. Original Baby Back Ribs: STAY AWAY!  Dry with a tiny portion of meat and an overly tangy ketchup-like BBQ sauce.  Just awful. 2. Ultimate Bacon Cheeseburger: Just ok.  The patty was small and on the dry side although the buttered bun was a nice touch. 3. Skillet Mashed Potatoes: Very meh and on the bland side. 4. Fries: Just ok.  Your standard fries. 5. Cajun Chicken Pasta: This was actually the best part of the meal.  They were able to add some broccoli and it was a very solid dish, overall, with chicken strips and a decently creamy sauce.  No, it's not the best pasta but compared to everything else, it was the winner. Price-wise, portions are small for what you pay and the overall bill including tap and tip came to about $45 for 3 entrees and a coffee (which you should NEVER get here - lesson learned).  definitely heading to Red Lobster next door or driving to a Ruby Tuesday.  At least their ribs are edible!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus

Marvin J.,"Jersey City, NJ",95,6,2,1.0,5/16/2017,"*Review for a visit on Wednesday the 8th of February 2017* I actually enjoy Chili's since they're a little more different than the average chain restaurant focusing on Tex-Mex-esqe fare. The restaurant seemed to have been understaffed for a weekday night which is understandable considering a smaller crowd expectation during my visit. However it took 10 minutes for the hostess to seat us, and after we were seated for 25 minutes without our arrival being noticed by the wait staff I had to find the hostess to ask for the waiter and after waiting another 10 minutes, we just left the restaurant.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to offer a complete review of my experience, maybe it could serve as a cautionary tale instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus

Sherl D.,"Newark, NJ",34,4,3,1.0,4/16/2017,"My boyfriend and I came to this location for the FIRST time and it was a big loss.  ** I am not a chillis fan because the food is all microwaved but my boyfriend wanted to try the lava cake so bad and it was little quick bite before catching a movie and we decided to go there and we REGRETTED to the maximum). *p.s my boyfriend didn't get the lava cake because of the bad experience.   (Ronnie our server was OK) he would of been BETTER if he had proper training but I can't really blame him because the so called MANAGERS, Shift leaders or supervisors WERE NOT doing their jobs properly. 1) the hostess was wearing a "" slippers "" like are you at work or in your bedroom???  2)she sat us at a STICKY table and the floor was dirty, and just dropped the menu to the table and walked away , didn't even say anything else to us. 3) WE MOVED to the next table 92 and it wasn't a smart idea because we could see how filthy the bar area was....papers on the floor, the broom and dust pan facing us and 10000 of ""workers"" walking by and not picking them up. YOU CAN TELL THERE'S ABSOLUTELY ZERO TEAM WORK OVER THERE.  4) Finally our server Ronnie came to the table 10 minutes later after we got sat .  I HAD TO ASK HIM TO SWEEP THE FLOOR  where my bf and I were sitting because it was gross..... * my boyfriend had the full baby back ribs and when the food came to the table, RONNIE didn't even bring an extra plate for the bones and Asparagus had NO TASTE whatsoever . 5) NONE of the 200000 ""managers"" checked on us to see if everything was ok ..they were too busy standing by and watching the game that was on. 6) a FOUR top came in and the hostess had them sat on the table in front of me and THEY POLITELY asked the hostess if they can sit by the window and THE HOSTESS REPLIED """"""""that section is closed"" like WTF.. you're supposed to satisfied the guests. AND WALKED AWAY.  7) a girl was running food and she was screaming on top of her lungs, HOT DISHES, hot dishes from the kitchen to the bar....like don't you know the plates were hot before you even picked them up????  8) BATHROOM WAS GROSS, PAPERS ON THE FLOOR ALL OVER, GARBAGE WAS FULL 9) some girls (WORKERS) were standing by the bar and taking selfies... and hostess walking with a drink in her hand while sitting people...VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.  P.S we only saw 1 girl who was actually cleaning her section (sweeping the floor etc) that was the girl at the bar by the window) she needs to tell her coworkers how to do their jobs.  THIS PLACE NEEDS TO LET GO ALL OF THE MANAGERS WHO WERE ON DUTY and all of the staff who was sectioned at the bar area including the hostess who was wearing the slippers  ON SATURDAY NIGHT  APRIL 15, 2017 .

Sara C.,"Wayne, NJ",166,214,95,3.0,3/12/2016,"As far as the menu and food is concerned, this place is pretty standard. It is spacious and there are plenty of tables/seats around the bar. There were two things that stuck out on my most recent trip here: 1. The ziosk on each table. It allows you to play games (for $1.99), look at a menu, order dessert, log into a rewards account, and pay your bill. We used it a couple times throughout the night and I was really impressed at how it printed a receipt after we paid. The only thing I wish it had was a page server button so you can call one over when you needed something.  2. Our server Louis was amazing. He was very funny, nice, and even helped accommodate dishes. I would go back to this location for him alone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus

Nate S.,"New York, NY",368,302,221,4.0,10/24/2015,"2.5 stars average..why?? Don't ask me the server's name but he was on point: he made good suggestions and he kept it real about what to avoid including drinks. We came in a group of 4 on a Saturday night at 1145, bar had a last call of 12. He recommended the Tito's punch which I was concerned was going to be too sweet and too fruity..but he kept recommending it, said we should get two each since it was last call.. and he was right..it was strong, refreshing and tasty..if you like rum punch with tequila you won't regret it. Food wise: we based our selections on his suggestions..which were all apps..the Buffalo wings (8 pieces), the guacamole and nachos (guacamole could've used more salt..too bland..saved by the salsa which was good), the chicken and something Flatbread (excellent), and then the egg rolls (beyond excellent). Bill with everything plus a lemonade was $82...didn't feel rushed to pay even though they wee clearly closing as evidenced by them dusting, turning off tvs, counting registers etc..we might as well have been part of the clean up crew. Not a Jersey resident so I probably won't be back..but definitely part of the better experiences I've had at a Chili's in a long time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus?start=20

My friends and I went there after seeing a movie and ordered some appetizers and main dishes. One of my friends asked for a side of grilled shrimp and received a TINY container (it was the size of the containers they use to put condiments) of about 4 baby ""rubbery"" shrimp.  When the waitress came to bring our checks she kindly removed it from my friend's bill.  They should be embarrassed to call this a ""side"" dish.  The service was good and the food came fast, so I gave it 2 stars for that reason.  However, 2 out 4 of us agreed we will not eat here again.

Eugene O.,"New York, NY",405,428,1582,3.0,5/10/2014,"Average neighborhood Chili's.  I been here quite a few times, for Lunch, Dinner, or just drinks  and watch a game. Parking can be challenging since they share the lot with a bunch of other restaurants and the movie theater.  If you are lucky enough to get a spot on a busy day count your blessings.  I normally run in, get my name on the list to get the pager and then go looking for parking.  2 birds, 1 stone. Restaurant area is nicely kept, also now they installed the Zoosk virtual water sorta program.  You can pay your bill, play games, and order drink refills and desert.  Pretty neat and long overdue if you ask me. The bar area is nice and large with all seats having great viewing angles to watch your favorite games.  It also tends not to be very busy if there is a long wait.  So if you don't mind eating at the bar, which I never do this might be your best bet. Now to the food. Food here is your average selection of Mexican dishes, burgers and ribs,  Everything I order always comes out warm and tastes the same.  Nothing to write home about.  You can always do better if you go to an authentic Mexican joint, but this is Chili's! Beer is cold, good selection,  Bulldogs (Margarita with a Coronita upside down) always hits the spot, especially on hot days.  There is also a good choice of bottled beers.  Drafts are your normal selection of american favorites and my favorite Stella!

After half my beard went grey the server is bringing out the food, she then proceeds to give my wife and son their food but as she reaches for my sons plate, there goes my ribs like a body in the Hudson River with cement boots to the floor. I get an oops, not even a sorry. Remember the broccoli? Forget about that i get fries so salty my lips looked like i was 90 after 2 bites. It continues, my wife had a burger that was so greasy the bun turned back to dough and my sons corn on the cob was cold as could be. After i received my ribs, if you want to call them ribs, since i didnt even need a napkin to wipe my hands after i consumed them let alone a wet nap the server disappeared to get my wife her Texas cheese fries that she forgot.  Finally, i ask for the check and then im asked if i want the dessert that comes with my meal to which i reply no. ""Would you like it to go?"" She says. I reply ""i dont even want it to stay forget about to go""  I told my wife even if the dessert was something decent it would have been 3 times the taste of the meal.

There are a lot of tv's with sporting events.  The location is also nice as its next to a movie theatre and other shopping area. The food however, for lack of a better word, BLOWS. Their fried food all comes with a nasty after taste (the oil is old). Margaritas tasted like pure sugar with no alcohol at all. The boneless wings were 85% breading and hardly any chicken. If you are coming here to watch a game and have a beer it's a win. If you decide to get any food or cocktails you won't be so pleased. Bar service was also quite slow and inefficient.

The first time was a not so good experience that I couldn't bare to come back but years have passed its time to burn the bridges. Natalia our dearly great server, we never really had to ask for anything she kind of just read our minds, my bf would tell me we need more napkins and out of nowhere there she goes with napkins, I whispered to my bf, Babe you need another soda, Natalia within a semi second with full cup of diet coke. Ok so it's not mind reading but it is good service.  Since when did the menu change? It really is completely different from the past, CHANGE IS GOOD! I ordered under the under the calorie menu, Salmon with steamed broccoli and citrus rice, I regretted it the moment our server left, WHY WOULD YOU ORDER SALMON IN CHILIS? so I had very low expectations uhmm I was wrong it was very well seasoned, not dry at all, for under 600 calories I can  have that salmon everyday. My bf had some smoky bbq bacon, well he didn't leave a crumb. Semi pickled pickles with dill I believe , WHOA I can eat a plate of those and go home satisfied. I'm a Spinach Dip kind of sore (lol) I order it everywhere and that was the only one I wasn't really a fan of, the chips were heavily salty and the spinach dip came in a skillet but the middle was cold BUT all is forgiven I can deal with the salty chips I will be back again in less than 5 years I promise :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus?start=40

My sons burger they microwaved it and the bun was hard and burn when I showed the manager she said you want me to get a new bun. No you should have ran to get a new burger.

The food took  a long time to come out and when it did they gave are soup / app with are dinner all at the same time. Soup was good the steak was cold . The worse steak I have had in a long time . They offered free desert . But I did not go there for desert so the fail. I would think twice about going back to Chill's. It looks like I am not the only to complain about this.

Emery G.,"Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ",377,300,2058,4.0,5/21/2014,"This place is in a great location. Had dinner with friends here and drinks while watching the Miami heat and Indianapolis pacers game.  The waiter was attentive until we were finished with our meals. He didn't check on us during or after. But it was super nice of other waiters to keep asking us if we needed anything. That was really kind of them. Used the Ziosk to reorder our drinks and it came in no time. That was awesome. Their frozen margaritas are really good. They have raspberry, strawberry, and mango. The strawberry was out of this world. Best flavor in my opinion to choose. Well I didn't try the raspberry one but strawberry is a ten out of ten.  The southwest Mac and cheese and burger bites were fantastic. The Mac and cheese has chives and something with a spice in it that separated it from regular Mac and cheese. Also the cheese is so creamy and the noodles so soft. It's a great side dish. The burger bites happy hour item came with two mini burgers and fries. The burger meat was so fresh. It tasted like they grind the meat, mold the burger, then freshly grill it to order. It was super super good. It comes with bacon and cheese and a side of ranch which was the perfect condiment to put in the burger. Great night here watching the game. They put the volume up so you can get in the sports mood.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus?start=40
ML T.,"Manhattan, NY",86,22,5,1.0,4/9/2016,"I'm sure you've read the reviews that start with....""If I could give this place no star at all, etc.."" Yeah, this is one of those.  I dislike the fact that I even have to give it 1 star. Horrible, horrible service. We live in NYC and I was craving that molten lava cake. I used to live in florida and they have a chill's in like every corner. But coming  back home, I couldn't find not one chilli's in the city. I googled it, the nearest one was this location. Which is about a 30 minute drive more or less, plus toll. My point is that it was so NOT worth the drive or the trouble because I didn't even get to have my freakin molten lava cake and I'll tell you why in a second. This was a couple weeks ago btw. Just hadn't had the time to sit down and write these paragraphs of how horrible the experience was, till now. Warning: This is a long review but worth the read.  Our waiter was so unprofessional, young kid and probably didn't know any better. He kept calling me sweetie after taking my orders for appetizer and entree... ""ok, and what would like to drink with that sweetie."" While my boyfriend was sitting there next to me. If it was the other way around and a female/waitress was calling my man sweetie, it would annoy me. It was just strange and as I said unprofessional. Like hello kid, you aren't with your friends hanging out somewhere. You don't know me on a personal level. I hate when people try and be extra friendly to get a better tip. Just do your job, get our orders right and attend to us in a timely manner and you will get a good tip. It's simple. There is a more professional way of doing things. This a business. Period. Moving along, I ordered the chicken alfredo or something with pasta and ok yes, it is a fast food restaurant but I really had no idea almost everything was microwaved. It tasted like a frozen tv dinner. I could have stayed at home and cooked a phonemail meal instead of eating this garbage. I didn't even take two forks at it and I was immediately looking for my waiter to tell him I didn't want it....he was nowhere to be found. I saw him 10 minutes later by the bar talking  and laughing it up with his coworkers, I kept putting my hand up and trying to make eye contact with him and nothing. Didn't even look our way. So I caught another waiter on his way back from serving a table near us and asked him to get the manager bc my food is horrible, I wanted to try and order something else and my waiter is nowhere to be found. (Wish I remembered his name.) Manager came over, I pointed him out and she apologized, admitted to the pasta being frozen and microwaved and said she is surprised we are compiling about one her best waiters. I said listen, the kid is charismatic but he's slacking. She comped my meal and asked if we wanted dessert on the house. I said ok yes...I'D LIKE A MOLTEN LAVA CAKE. (You know the one I had been craving and drove these miles to have after my meal) She said no problem we will get that for you in a sec. She apologizes again and walks away.... I guess she went back to tell the kid we had complained about him and how he didn't provide not even decent service. The kid walked over to us and said he was pulled aside by his manger. Is there anything else he can get us. My boyfriend told him straight up, no thank you, dude, you're a horrible waiter. I thought it was harsh but it really was horrible service. He was without a doubt offended, he apologized and walked away. ....guess who came to bring us our dessert.  The kid!!!....and he came to our table with the meanest face and his tone of voice sounded like he clearly had an attitude. I felt like I was back in high school. smh. My boyfriend and I looked at each other. The same thought crossed our mind.  WE OBVIOUSLY DID NOT EAT THE MOLTEN LAVA CAKE. The kid probably spit it in or something. We got up, left the cake on the table and left. I was so angry for like 2hrs over this freaking dessert. Kept telling my boyfriend he should have waited till after dessert. lol ugh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus?start=40
Dino L.,"Jamaica, NY",13,6,,1.0,6/18/2015,"Horrible! Don't go here!!! First time here- I was traveling in the area with two business partners today and decided to get a quick bite to eat here. I should have walked out when we walked in and didn't get any service for 15 minutes- I mean there was absolutely no one at the front check in. A couple who were there before us left a few minutes after we arrived, grumbling under their breath about something. I didn't quite catch what was up but suspected that they were waiting for some time to be seated with out being approached by anyone in the restaurant. This is exactly what happened to us as we waited at least 15 minutes without so much as a ""hello"" or "" we'll be right with you""... Zero acknowledgement. Finally the bartender came over and seated us...she just seamed completely disengaged- no smile, didn't ask if we wanted drinks or appetizers.. No personality. This was embarrassing as this was a business colleague visiting from Georgia and it was just an embarrassing representation of the NY/ NJ area. Again this was just a quick bite and chance to rest up and talk shop. Unfortunately not only was the experience poor, one of my colleagues became ill apparently from the food and we had to cancel evening dinner plans.

Kenna M.,"Jersey City, NJ",96,229,31,4.0,4/19/2014,"Randomly decided to grab lunch before seeing a movie at the Kerasotes theater next door. We were the first few patrons - this this might explain the quick service and food carefully catered to our liking.  I had a medium ribeye - it was $16, with a side of broccoli and loaded mashed potatoes.To be honest, I was pleased. I didn't expect to be amused by a steak from here, but I give them credit for making the steak medium, being sure not to overcook it. Its been a consistent issue of mine, especially at TGIFridays (Bayonne), which makes me iffy about ordering steaks at ""slow fast food"" places. Boyfriend had a smokehouse burger - included bacon, cheese, and friend onion rings - plus all other vegetable fixings. He was satisfied - very.  Here's the highlight of our lunch - It was BOOZY. We ordered margaritas - house ($3-ish) and flavored ($4.50) whaaaaat. Even better, they have these new tablet things for each table where you can reorder your drinks (or order a dessert). Needless to say, we left BUZZY. It was convenient. Even more convenient (I'm on the fence about), for the parent whose child relies on technology to behave, you can pay .99 cents to activate the games on the tablet.

My boyfriend got buffalo wings as his appetizer and said they were amazing and cooked perfectly. I think the manager or assistant manager took our entree orders - my boyfriend got a smoked chicken burrito and I specifically asked if they did vegetarian enchiladas and she said yes so I went ahead and ordered an enchilada with black beans, onions, and peppers in it. My boyfriend said his burrito wasn't seasoned enough and was way too salty - it was mediocre. My enchiladas were dry and they were not stuffed with black beans like I had asked, but instead stuffed with broccoli (and onions and peppers) which I had not asked for.

Never got plates until complained to waiter 3 times.  Kids, especially my 2 year old, were starving. 2 year old has food allergies so limited options. We had put in order for chicken nuggets at same time as appetizer order. After 800 hit my son was eating decorative lettuce off of appetizer plate he was so hungry, as main courses had not come out. We were assured by waiter chicken nuggets were coming out right away. 810 hits and no main courses. Called manager who insisted nuggets were coming out immediately.Made major fuss at which time manager says we dont have to pay for meal. This does not solve problem of my 2 year old still starving. They have no answers for food delays.  All the while we see 2 parties who came in well after us get food, eat, and leave. Perhaps this was a case of racism, not sure.  Unacceptable experience.

That server, other servers,  the manager and bartender all took notice of us sitting there not being helped and did nothing.  Some passed us multiple times.  What got us was that the manager choose to stand around and chit chat with the servers rather then inquire about the guest that were sitting at a table for over 10 minutes without being greeted.  Finally we just got up and walked back to the door.  We passed both the server and manager who said nothing.  We mentioned to the host that we hadn't been waited on and he didn't seem to care.  At that point we had had enough and went to another restaurant in the complex.

We had to follow up with two more times before they finally removed it. Johnny and Nika got  the Wings Over Buffalo, which wasn't breaded but looked broiled. The wings looked meh and meager like there was hardly any flesh on it. They liked how it tasted though.  Nika got the mix and match fajitas which came with a lot of food and Johnny ordered steak.

My boyfriend and I frequent the Chili's in Totowa and while we don't have GREAT service there on a regular basis the food is always on point. We usually order the margarita flat bread, sweet potato fries and a few beers. Tonight we tried the Secaucus location because we were catching a movie. However both the kitchen AND staff failed to deliver. After waiting over 20 minutes for a round of beers (because there were no clean beer mugs) we waited 30 minutes for our apps which came out cold! The server while pleasant lacked any personality whatsoever which was a bummer especially since you couldn't hear/understand a word she said.

I mean, I know this is no five-star place, but if your looking for some good bar food at a decent price, I have to say that Chilli's is a great option. The spinach and artichoke dip was delicious, and my burger was great. I was ecstatic to find they had grilled the bun in butter or oil (that's the key) prior to assembling the burger. I topped the patty with swiss, avocado, and bacon (which was crispy and cooked just right). I washed it down with a bud light draft and felt very satisfied- maybe too satisfied... I definitely ate too much.  I have to say that Chilli's was a win, especially since I only had to pay half price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus?start=80

When we finally got our food, I was so anxious to get out of the hell hole that we just dipped as soon as it came out. Of course, they forgot my salad dressing for my salad, and messed up my bf's order.  The other time we went there, it was for a simple dessert. WHAT DESSERT TAKES 45 MINUTES TO MAKE? To top that off all the workers try to avoid my death glares so they don't have to explain the wait. They look like they are socializing with each other more than they are working.

Restaurant was not busy and some how the server Angelica still managed to take twenty minutes to greet us. When we ordered drinks they either came out wrong or did not come at all. The manager who ran our appetizers to the table told us he would come back with side plates and never did. Once the food was finished we stacked the dirty plates at the end of the table and they sat there as numerous employees including a manager, walked by them. Sides that we ordered were missing from the entrees. Water had to be asked for three times before it came to the table. The server was polite but completely oblivious to the poor service and therefore was unapologetic. At the end of the meal when we brought all these mistakes to the managers attention, he simply said he would go to the back and find out what went wrong. We never saw him again! As a party of four, whom all work in the food/service industry, we understand that mistakes happen. However this experience was absolutely terrible.

This place is clean prompt polite service and the food looks like the picture in the menu,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus?start=120
Uni R.,"Elmwood Park, NJ",4,1,3,4.0,3/23/2014,"Husband and I are regulars here lol.  We always sit at the bar, bartenders are always nice and friendly. The food is great and margaritas are a ++++",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus?start=120
Jessica K.,"Hillsdale, NJ",21,349,53,3.0,2/6/2012,"Nothing special or out of the ordinary will be found on the menu here, but maybe that's what makes it a safe choice. I would never decline an invite to meet up at a place that serves delicious, pretty blue margaritas. Wash down some chicken fritters, or anything deep fried from the menu, and ya got it made.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus?start=120
Julia W.,"Milpitas, CA",215,449,3,2.0,5/4/2009,"As much as I love Chili's, this location was one of the not-so great experiences I've had.  The food is on par with all the other locations in the nation but the service was really slow.  Still, our waiter (Edgar) was smiling and really eager to make sure everything was okay. Too bad that our chips didn't come out with our drinks and the lemonade machine kept breaking.  It took forever for us to get our food and our check, causing us to miss our starting time which made me miss my flight back to California in the end.  If you do decide to eat here, make sure you don't have a time constraint!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus?start=120
Patriot ..,"Elizabeth, NJ",0,41,2,2.0,6/14/2014,This place is not good . The people working there are second rate . The food is brutal .$70 for family of four . It's just not worth it . At least 5 better choices right in that area. From the enchiladas to the tacos . Not good everything taste like it's from a can . Chipotle Bdubs Red Robin Outback hell even Houlihans is a better option . You can take your family twice to Chipotle for that price with a much higher quality of food. But the table made Guac is good. Service ok.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus?start=120

Ashley Z.,"Manhattan, NY",0,46,,4.0,1/27/2012,"In my opinion, it is a good chain restaurant for Mexican food. I ordered the Quesadillas which is new on the menu. The food is very good quality and healthy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus?start=120

Vincent T.,"Glen Head, NY",45,39,,3.0,11/1/2011,Regular chain restaurant with the same food and menu as every other restaurant in the chain.

wilbur l.,"Union City, NJ",21,41,,3.0,7/9/2011,"good old american chain, like it for its fast service and their 2 for $20 dinner deal, which includes a quite tasty burger or a generous portion of cajun chicken alfredo pasta.   All heavy stuff, but what do you expect from a chained-restaurant?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus?start=120
David B.,"Edgewater, NJ",0,28,,1.0,12/6/2013,My Girlfriend and myself order curb side every wed night and every time I have to call the manager to take my order because the four prior phone calls that I made just rang and rang and rang... We did this for seven months!!!! I'm finished now..Heres a great  tip Chilis STOP HIRING 17 YEAR OLD KIDS TO ANSWER A PHONE...They are clearly too busy playing on other devices such as smart phones or tablets to mess around answering resturant buisness lines.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus?start=120
Nell H.,"Denver, CO",1,6,,1.0,3/26/2013,"I hate giving only one star, but this place deserves ZERO stars. Chili's in general as a chain has gone FAR south and I won't ever be visiting one again. This one in particular was disgusting. My grilled chicken sandwich was cold, the bread was stale, the lettuce was brown, and it was served with 10 cold fries. The service was bad, we did not have one waitress but a couple different waitresses that failed to refill drinks or attend the table at all. The manager is rude and non-accomendating. Overall I suggest you avoid this place, it's not worth your time or money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus?start=120

Their food is delicious and the surrounding atmosphere is pleasant. The host/hostess and wait staff are very knowledgeable as well as for friendly. Friends and family of mine have reported all positive experiences. I will certainly be returning.
