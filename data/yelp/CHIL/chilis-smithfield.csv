Alex B.,"Smithfield, RI",37,39,5,5.0,10/10/2017,I am very happy with my experience at this chili's. My steak was overdone but the manager came over and got me a steak which was perfect no argument free salad took money off of my bill excellent excellent service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield
Tony P.,"North Providence, RI",374,406,243,4.0,6/20/2017,In my humble opinion they serve up the best nachos.  They come loaded with goodies and fun and Happy stuff.  Tonight I was in the mood for a burger.  I got their guacamole burger - I paid the extra $1 for their grass fed patty and it was definitely worth it.  This organic burger was simply a well seasoned hunk of beef laying on a bun.  This was one chunky piece of beef.  It's imperfect shape was perfectly seasoned.  This is what pure beef taste like.  I've changed my mind about Chilis - they've made some improvements.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield
Holly L.,"Providence, RI",351,419,450,1.0,2/17/2017,Service is always lacking. Always. Half the time they don't have items especially on Sundays. Items like chips for their chips and salsa. They need someone on the ball to place their weekly orders.  I have literally left this location and drove to the Lincoln one...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield
mar h.,"Providence, RI",13,12,,1.0,3/29/2017,Terribly loud music. I don't know why these restaurants don't understand the people come here to talk to each other not to be blasted out of their eardrums,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield
Wendy A.,"Johnston, RI",29,20,1,2.0,9/27/2017,"Food is just ok. They are constantly changing their menu so if you like something they have today....it may not be on the menu next visit. VERY DISSAPOINTED they stopped free chips & salsa if you are sitting at the bar. You would think if you frequent the place and the bartender says hey, would you like chips & salsa and you say yes that you won't be charged $4.19 for them since you never, ever had to pay for them EVER. Only bright spot now that I have to pay for chips & salsa is we at least like the bartenders but it's probably not enough to keep us coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield
Jasmin G.,"Providence, RI",323,233,304,5.0,12/21/2015,"I usually wait awhile before I give reviews as I did and I had an amazing great experience. From entering and being greeted with a smile everything from there was pleasant all the way until we left.  Our servers name was Cassandra she was so sweet and understanding and patient with us. She greeted us with a smile and told us about some deals , answered all our questions and helped us with choosing. They had this amazing 35.00 deal which was 1 appetizer to share , 2 entrees , 2 alcoholic beverages and 1 desert to share , that's a DEAL! The food was great, we really enjoyed it, but the drinks that was another story.  The customer service was amazing. We hated the drinks and I explained nicely we didn't like them and right away Cassandra took them deducted them and got us new drinks. With no problem , she was so sweet. I was so happy with how great she did to accommodate us.  Each course came out on time and didn't take forever. I really admire this place and I will be back more. I hope Cassandra gets acknowledged because she did amazing! Thanks again for the great food guys!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield
Jeffry L.,"North Providence, RI",35,28,16,3.0,8/2/2017,Basically just your average chain restaurant. The wife and go here every now and then. Service is always good and we like there meal deals. Tonight we there for an early dinner we did the 2 for $22 we started with the chips and salsa with guacamole the chips where greases over salted the salsa is hit or miss depending on who's working that day and makes it. For dinner the wife order the sirloin medium rare mashed potatoes and broccoli with a side of shrimp which came out southwest style not what she wanted. I ordered the firer pepper chicken crisper so am so glade I ordered the sauce on the side talk about some heat it was good came with a side of French fries and corn on the cob. The fries were hot but not done to my liking and the corn which I never eat anyways because they over season and all I taste is salt. Our waitress was great we were just happy the food came out hot considering it was early so the place wasn't jamming. Like said about the salsa it all depends on who's working that day. So if you want just an average dining experience than this is the place for you.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield
Eric G.,"Smithfield, RI",120,4,,1.0,3/28/2017,So just to followup I haven't heard from or received any followup from corporate regarding this issue.....this makes my choice to study away much easier......Applebees has since taken its place,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield
Karen G.,"North Providence, RI",0,2,,2.0,2/20/2017,"Took our young grandson for supper because he wanted to play with the tabletop computers.  When we walked in, we were greeted at the door, and I mentioned that it was my grandson's birthday.   The young man winked at me conspiratorially and said ""I'll take care of it.""  As we were walking to our seats, he said it to me again.  I thanked him and figured he'd take care of it!  After the merely passable food, the server came over and asked us if we wanted anything else.  I smiled and nodded towards our grandson, and she smiled, then brought the check!  I certainly wasn't going to say anything at that point, but I was really disappointed that his birthday wasn't acknowledged.  We've never had that happen before.  I'm thinking the young man simply never told our server about it.  But since the food was edible at best, we won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield
M M.,"Greensboro, NC",0,20,1,5.0,12/29/2016,I had drinks and dinner at the bar with Cassandra.  I could see a touch of the kitchen where David the manager was conducting the work flow like a maestro.  I like the food and staff here very much.  I can also recommend as a starter: Grilled asparagus - fresh and cooked to perfection.  Excellent job everyone!

Theresa S.,"Puyallup, WA",1,8,,3.0,5/10/2017,"Dinner with kids, grandkids and friends of theirs.  Margarita was good.  Chips and salsa were great.  Food was alright. Husband didn't care for the sirloin steak.  i had half rack of ribs with undercooked green beans. Kids ate too many chips to finish their meals.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield
Joe C.,"Greenville, RI",1868,753,94,2.0,9/9/2014,"Crappy Chain What can I say, salt, salt, and more salt.  For some reason I feel like Chili's was better a decade ago.  Now it is pretty average at best.   The staff is always pretty nice and they do have a decent half price menu, but in the end it's a cheesy chain that is definitely giving people high blood pressure.   Tip:  Best day to go is on Monday, 2 for 1 fajitas.   Sorry to say there are so many other better places to go out to eat. Thanks",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield
Liz M.,"North Providence, RI",131,346,375,5.0,3/27/2014,I'm usually not a fan of chain restaurants but  really enjoy the food here. The portions are decent sized and I eat here two times a week without a mess up of my food. Laurie is my favorite bartender there she always remembers my order and chats with me which is great because I usually go to lunch alone. Great place for a quick lunch.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield
Casey K.,"North Providence, RI",0,14,7,4.0,4/17/2016,"Decent meal for decent price, usual for chain restaurants. Wait staff was amazing this visit, friendly, happy, and on top of everything. We (date and myself) were given two waitresses, not sure why, but both were great. I ordered a strawberry patron margarita and highly recommend it an anyone, I absolutely love it. We shared a Texas cheese fry appetizer, they didn't seem to have peppered the fries like usual, but they were still good. As for our lunches, I ordered the new prime rib fresh Mex bowl, and he ordered the prime rib burrito. My bowl was decent, however, I feel like I would've gotten better had I gone to the Chipotle across the parking lot. My date faired better, I tried his dish and it was delicious, definitely recommend the prime rib burrito.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield
Tess W.,"Sterling, CT",21,140,63,3.0,2/16/2015,"Quick meal. Got the (looked like chicken tortilla) soup and a cuppa hot tea. It was quite decent and kept me from buying the whole of Dave's when I went shopping later. I have seen some comments about the salt and I agree. Just ask for no added salt. I had the tamales once, good but salty. No way to remove the salt from them. I did ask the manager about the salty food, someone needs to taste these things before they send them out. I got out of there for $7. Not counting tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield
JLynn C.,"Coventry, RI",591,337,2382,3.0,11/19/2013,I would give this Chili's 4 stars for food only and 3 for the service. The take out order was ready quickly and the food was as expected but the person behind the bar doing the to go orders was not friendly at all...actually extremely rude. Not my problem you are a miserable person who hates their job. Anyway I'd still eat from there again because the food is good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield
Jesse P.,"Smithfield, RI",0,2,,1.0,2/27/2016,"Absolutely terrible service. Waitress had no idea what she was doing and ignored us. It took a half hour to get a soup the size of a small coffee cup, and our fries. And then food came out right after, great timing! The food was cold and disgusting, it didn't look fresh at all, it looked like someone heated up leftovers. I'm sick as I'm writing this. This isn't even a joke, the food and service was that bad, never going to any of these restaurants again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield
Jeff M.,"Indianapolis, IN",3,5,,1.0,4/25/2015,"Complete crap. Waited 30 minutes for kids mac-n-cheese, a steak and two flatbreads that never came. Had to ask for drink refills and the bottomless chips and salsa refill only got offered after we were told a manager would bring our food.  Left after 5 more minutes when manager never showed.  Decided I was done being lied to.  Possibly the worst customer service experience ever in food service.  Congrats.  You will be a case study.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield
Ralph A.,"Kinnelon, NJ",64,241,12,4.0,5/26/2013,"I haven't been to Chilii's in a while, they have a pretty good combo lunch menu (soup/sandwhich) like Panera Bread. The quality of food seems to have improved since I was last at a Chili's. Apparently you don't get chips for free if you sit anywhere other than the bar, not sure what that's all about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield
Dani H.,"Somerville, MA",198,30,2,4.0,10/5/2013,"I was in town for the Rock 'n' Roll Providence Half Marathon so my friends and I decided to hit up Chili's since 2 of our crew is Gluten Free. There were 4 of us total and we were on a bit of a budget so we decided to do the 2 for $20 dealio. It included a set menu of choices to pick from, but the deal included an appetizer and 2 entrees. We were in! My friend's boyfriend and I went with the chipotle chicken flatbread (yummy, but definitely had a kick ;)) then I got the Margarita Grilled chicken (from the lighter choices menu) and he got the fajitas. Both entrees were tasty and full of flavor. Since I had the half marathon I had double carbs as my side - rice and mashed potatoes - and both were good. My 2 gluten free friends split the 2 for $20 deal as well and got the salsa/guacamole, mango-chile talapia and mango-chile chicken. They both loved that it was gluten free, but were not ready for the big taste of chile. It was a tad spicy for both of their liking, but they still ate it all. :) We didn't want to wait for a table so we sat in the bar and had nice quick service, which was appreciated. Our waitress joked with us, but made sure nothing was missing from our order. The 2 for $20 deal was awesome. We ended up spending more on drinks than food. ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield
Ivana M.,"Johnston, RI",0,1,,2.0,1/23/2015,Last night my husband and I came into your restaurant for supper and we both ordered Buffalo chicken salads.  I noticed something was different but my husband did not notice.  I just went on line and realized that there were no tortilla chips in our salads.  This is the second time we had a problem there.   On another occasion I ordered Spicy Shrimp tacos and my shrimp were not fully cooked.  When I order them now I have to remind the server to please make sure the shrimp is pink.   We come to the restaurant almost every week and we live close by so I would hate not to give it a try again.   Please talk to your staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield?start=20
James F.,"North Attleborough, MA",14,278,6,2.0,1/15/2011,"It's a Chili's, you should know what you're getting yourself into. Grading on a recent visit with a party of 6. The salsa is very watery, and the chips are thin, un-substantial and overly salted (but again - it's a Chili's - I'm not expecting the most authentic tex-mex cuisine).  That said, we still devoured it and i was happy the salsa wasn't overly spicy. I had a pulled pork sandwich.  It's tough to screw that up, and they didn't, but it was nothing special.  The fries with it were salted too much (sensing a trend). The waiter seemed like he was trying out material for his stand-up routine.  That said, it wasn't a bad experience, as some of his material was fairly entertaining. We got seated near the door (in winter) when the place was not nearly packed - deduction for that one. They also apparently have happy hour drink and food specials after 9pm, but the food specials are only in the 'lounge' (bar area).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield?start=20
Marco D.,"Cranston, RI",17,150,31,3.0,12/30/2012,"Went to Chili's with my parents.  The entire reason for this review is the new burger they have. The guacamole burger is amazing.  Best burger I've had in a while.  They served my mom a piña colada with a huge long hair on top if it, made them take it back and they promptly brought another one.  Eh, shit happens I guess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield?start=20
Dave S.,"Greenville, RI",1,8,10,2.0,10/24/2014,Although the bar is a great deal for the money after 9 pm the dinning room/dinner menu has become nothing short of disgusting!  They have cut so many corners with the food quality that it is barely what I would even consider food!  The signature sizzling fajitas has gotten so nasty that i cant even smell the brown grossness they bring your peppers and onions and what they consider meat on!  Drop the stupid sizzling plate already its stupid and only clutters your tables!  Seriously if they dont start making changes they will not last as a whole!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield?start=20
Joseph D.,"Providence, RI",82,75,44,4.0,3/9/2012,"I love Chilis... yeah i said it.  Its one of my guilty ""restaurant chain"" pleasures.  Not sure what all the gripes are about.  I have been in this location half a dozen times and the service was always quick and friendly, the chips I have never experienced to be overly greasy, but it is a ""fried"" product.  And the salsa, which can be watery at times in my recent experience, was thick and spicy.  But come on, I'm going in for the Margaritas.... god I love tequila.  And to my surprise, they consistently pour a stiff drink, even the $5 specials do not skimp on the alcohol, so in my opinion, for a decent drink, some chips and salsa, and amazing southwest eggrolls... I will roll into this Chilis anytime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield?start=20
Kelsey G.,"Washington, DC",235,7,,4.0,8/21/2015,"tortilla chips and guac forever. i went there a lot over the year, and we got so many of those we were always too full for our meal.

Geoffrey H.,"North Attleborough, MA",6,21,8,4.0,5/9/2014,"This is an excellent location for a after work bar meet-up. The staff is very friendly and the bar room adapts well to large groups. This particular Chili's has an excellent bar staff (at least at the time this review was written) and is one of our favorite after work destinations for going away parties. As far as food goes this is just another Chili's so expect a similar level of pretty consistent Chili's food. I'd recommend going for the lighter options to avoid the salt & fat, otherwise, this is a great place to spend some time with friends, drinks and appetizers.

Elena N.,"Providence, RI",109,67,20,2.0,12/27/2013,"Just waited 45 minutes for a salad & kid's chicken tenders. I was told the quesadilla explosion salad was huge but it was weak. Barely any corn & beans, quesadillas were cold & cheese congealed. The kid's meal fries were leather & tenders were blazing hot & filled with grease. I only give 2 stars bc the wait staff is super friendly and they replaced my daughter's meal with the quickness. Good people, bad food. Sorry!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield?start=20

Came in late on a weeknight with a party of six, and though the place was mostly empty, the dining room was a bit disheveled and the staff still seemed to be frantic. Despite whatever the distraction happened to be, our service was good and the food good as well. I had a mushroom Swiss burger which was big and juicy, and the fries were fresh and hot. The bowl of chili I ordered as an appetizer could have used a lot of help, however -- too soupy and lacking in hearty ingredients.

Our waitress/waitperson was friendly, attentive, but not intrusive. Our order came promptly. My friend ordered the ""Asian Salad"" which she found excellent. I chose the mushroom burger , which I cut in half and took the rest home for my evening meal.
