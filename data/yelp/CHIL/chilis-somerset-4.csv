Lori Z.,"Tiverton, RI",1,24,4,3.0,10/19/2017,"Me and a dear friend went to Chili's after she got out of work it was 7:30 on a Thurs night and they had about a 20 minute wait. That was a good sign as far as it was popular but of course no one likes to wait but it was very quick and the server Kristin came right over to take our order. The pleasant surprise was our hostess/ greeter  her name was Jackie and she was welcoming and made sure we were all set at our table and then stopped by again before we left to check on us. We appreciated the service we received. Food was very good and price point was pretty average for a chain. Seating was very good- tables and chairs,booth and bar seating. Parking was good and restaurant was very clean. Over all a good dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-somerset-4

Chelsea L.,"Portsmouth, RI",19,74,128,5.0,9/4/2017,"I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews at this location. We've been here so many times and only had great food and service. Today we got their premium Long Island iced teas for only $8 and they were mixed well and were very refreshing. We shared a triple dipped appetizer and everything came out hot and tasty. I think people sometimes expect too much out of chain restaurants, but this location is definitely one of the bests. You can leave feeling full and satisfied for not much money at all.

Jessica B.,"Westport, MA",0,1,1,1.0,6/25/2017,Horrible! I got my son a hamburger it was all red in the middle. I got smoked wings and they were not smoked at all just a rub on and all greasy.

Mallory R.,"Fall River, MA",136,112,150,4.0,9/20/2016,"For a chain, this Chilis is pretty good. I've been here a few times, and have always received excellent service.  The waiter or waitress we've had, are always nice, on top of everything, including refills and just overall great. I think this is one of the top reasons we've come back here. Great service is always a plus!  They have always been very accommodating to my food allergies.  No guff, and always great on suggesting some foods or drinks for me to try! My personal favorite meal are the fresh mex bowls. Fresh veggies that taste fresh and yummy.  I don't have any negative things really about this. I rated this restaurant only 4 stars because they are a chain, and the food obviously isn't top notch. It's a great place to go if you're in the area, or if you don't feel like cooking that night!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-somerset-4

Today I did a take out order and when I got there I was told there half my order they were out of but they ""couldn't call me because I didn't supply a number when I ordered"". I wish I had had my receipt which showed my phone number at the top of it. I then asked for something else and they were out of that. The place was filled with empty tables yet the dine in wait was 30 min. Will never go again will order take out from Fiesta instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-somerset-4
Holly P.,"Fall River, MA",1,39,6,2.0,4/10/2017,"I personally don't like the ziosks. The kids fight over it and it reduces family time. Yes, I could just say no to the games, but to be a kid and have that teaser in front of you just to have your mom say ""no"" is crappy. I'd rather go to a place where I don't have to play the bad guy just so I can interact with my family. The food is mediocre. I had the salmon a couple times and both times it was over cooked and the rice was hard like it had been sitting out for a long time. However, I like the spinach queso dip. This is a ""once in a blue moon"" kind of place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-somerset-4
Taryn L.,"New Bedford, MA",0,4,,1.0,12/2/2016,"The only good thing about this dining experience was the waitress.  We waited about 30 minutes for a table and the hostess was very unfriendly. The burger was completely over cooked and dry, the fries were dry and stale like you reheated old potatoes, and the bun was hard as a rock.  To top it off, the Ziosk charged us $1.99 for a trivia game, which we did not accept to pay what so ever. A nearby waitress overheard our debacle and started ARGUING with me about the fact that ""she's been here 11 years"" and she knows it warns you of the charges beforehand. It did not.  Chili's has completely gone downhill and I will never return to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-somerset-4
M. D.,"Lakeville, MA",3,16,,1.0,2/27/2017,"After trying this location multiple times, I have vowed to ONLY eat at the Raynham location. I have NEVER had a good meal here since moving to the area. The last time I ate here, we ordered take-out and I had ordered the burger sliders. When we got back to my house, I opened my box to find the burgers were BURNT, they had NONE of the toppings advertised on the menu, and one of them was missing the bottom bun! How does a cook make those mistakes? My only explanation is they were too lazy to fix their mistakes and just gave me a meal that wasn't even edible to save themselves time. I finally convinced my friends that I refuse to eat here anymore, but before we stopped going, we used to go out for girls' nights to get margaritas, which also sucked. They tasted like 100% mixer and no tequila. You don't even get a buzz, and I'll admit I'm a lightweight when I drink. For me to drink an entire margarita and not be phased by it means we got jipped, plain and simple. Whenever I've requested a refund from the managers here, they say the register has already been cleared out but they'll give me Chili's vouchers instead. I don't want vouchers to your crappy restaurant! I worked in food service too - you should NEVER close out the register until all the guests have left and the restaurant is officially closed! All in all, DON'T GO HERE. Make the extra drive to go to another location, or hop over the bridge to Fall River to support the small businesses there for dinner. You'll get much better food and much better service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-somerset-4
Dave F.,"Cranston, RI",28,100,2,1.0,12/8/2016,"Incredibly unpleasant experience for takeout. Ordered food at 6:38... had somewhere to be at 7:00. Now. I KNEW I was cutting it too close and was going to be late, but I was told 20 minutes and it's only 5 minutes from my final destination... perfect! Only 4-5 minutes late, lifesavers. About 5-7 minutes after my food was supposed to be out, the very pleasant hostess informed me that she was just waiting on the sides for fajitas. After standing there until 7:14 for my meals (another 7-8 minutes), while ""enjoying"" the sounds of the chef screaming/swearing about clean plates and the gentleman purposely changing kegs so loudly it actually startled me twice (I know it to be on purpose as he later kicked the empty over) I asked for my food despite the sides, which I found or was simply cheese, salsa and guac... the hostess (who once again was great) apologized as ""she asked him several times for it"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-somerset-4

We had our choices already picked out but none of that would work for Chili's.  Their disrespect and lack of caring means that we will never go back.  On our drive home I heard my kids keep saying ""worst birthday ever"".  The look on my wife's face was defeating.  Melts my heart and all because of Chili's lack of service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-somerset-4
Jonathan N.,"Providence, RI",109,5,1,1.0,1/12/2016,Second time I've placed a To-Go order and they once again messed up. Forgot a side and skimped on portions. 3 chicken tenders and half a bowl of mac and cheese and everything is cold. Can't believe this is happening twice.

Only one of the five meals was OK...chicken tenders. Other four died under the heat lamp. My sandwich was a real treat. Wilted lettuce, white tomato, one tiny half slice of avocado on one half. Two pieces of bacon on the other half. Roll hard yet plate too hot to touch. Death by Heat lamp. Each half sandwich had half just bread, the other half little rubber chicken.

Jessica V.,"Fall River, MA",20,58,76,4.0,2/25/2015,"I used to go to Chili's in Somerset all the time a few years ago, but now my visits are less frequent. But overall, if you are looking for a decent chain restaurant this is one of the good ones.  I went with a group of friends on a Saturday night to celebrate National Margarita Day. There was a 25 minute wait which went by quicker than that, and we were waited on immediately. Our waiter, TJ, was fantastic. We never had empty drinks or empty chips & salsa. Most of us just snacked on the chips, but my sisters boyfriend has a chicken bacon ranch quesadilla which came out pretty quickly, and he enjoyed. Overall if you want a decent chain experience Chili's in Somerset is the place to go. Fantastic staff, and great margaritas. My personal recommendations it the Blackberry Presidente!

My wife ordered a salad an I ordered some lite chicken dish.  We sat there for an hour before our food came out. When it did come out the quesadilla was burnt and cold the pizza was cold with congealed cheese. The grilled cheese was mushy and my chicken was luke warm. We didn't send it back because. we were starving. So half of the meals were cleared with half eaten or non eaten plates.  My son who ate the pizza preceded to wake up and vomit that night.

Ashley E.,"Longview, TX",3,52,13,4.0,6/30/2014,"I'm not sure why this place has a rating of 2.5 stars... Scanning the reviews, it looks like most people have an issue with the service. I could see that; our waiters (we had 2 that were working together) did kind of disappear at strange times, even though one of them told us, when we remarked upon the place being fairly busy, that they considered that time to be ""slow."" On the flip side, they pretty much nailed the food. The only issue we had was that a couple of the small burgers (sliders) were not cooked well enough. Like, the entire thing was pink. Drinks were quick enough, food was brought out quickly enough, and we didn't have to wait for our check. It also wasn't presented too early.  I think this location is pretty good. I just wouldn't recommend it during really busy times...

Kimberly W.,"Fall River, MA",20,98,4,3.0,7/6/2011,"Well.  Its a chain restaurant.  Its a fine atmosphere for a bite to eat, drinks and catching up.  Last time we went here it was because we needed a place that was open past 9 on a Tuesday for food.   After previous experiences at various Chili's I don't try to order anything but a burger; as everything else is entirely too generic.  The burgers are at least cooked to order.  I know what I'm getting, and I've not been disappointed.   Unfortunately, it being a chain restaurant, they apparently hire whoever has a pulse and is willing to wait tables.  our waitress this time was pleasant enough, but it took 15minutes to be seated (the place was empty, the hostess was no where to be found).  I understand  it was a Tuesday night late.....but where was the hostess?  After getting seated it was another 15 before our waitress showed up.  I imagine, she had no idea she had a table.  She was pleasant enough, and didn't mess up the order, so we gave her more credit, but she wasn't terribly quick.   Nothing was problematic enough on this visit to warrant a call to the manager or leaving her 2cents for a tip, so I suppose it was successful in the eyes of a Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-somerset-4?start=20

Ashley P.,"Warwick, RI",408,541,1280,3.0,11/5/2009,"Looking for a place to get together with some old friends for a couple hours?  Chili's is your place.  Met up with two high school friends last night to catch up, grab a bite to eat, and down a few well-earned beers after a long work day.  We all met at up 6:30, were seated immediately, and promptly given menus.   I ordered the endless soup and salad option ($6.99 at lunch but add $2 at dinner time) with draft Bud Light ($1.99 special!).  I love their loaded baked potato soup with chunks of potato, a creamy blend of cheeses and bacon bits sprinkled on top.  The salad is nothing to write home about.  That is. . . if they bring you the correct one.  It bothers me when the waitress is aware that she's making a mistake but tries to pass it off on you.  ""You ordered the Caesar salad right?""  No I didn't, so when I said ""I'll take the House salad"" then you listed off my choices of salad dressing, and I said ""Ranch"" you'd obviously record ""Caesar"" on your little pad. This only begins my gripe about our particular waitress.  Being a girl, with mostly male friends, you get used to the occasional flirting thrown their way from the rest of the female population.  I don't have a problem with this. . . what-so-ever.  What I do have a problem with is when the flirting interrupts normal conversation and professional boundries.   ""What can I get ya babe?""  To one friend.  ::elevator eyes:: to the other.  Lingering around the table after asking if everythings okay. . .so long that you take a 2nd look at her as if to ask. . . Well, do you need anything or can we go back to our conversation?  Just as I was about to entertain the idea that I was just making it up in my head, both friends turn to me and say ""What's with our waitress?  She's really strange, and its awkward when she's around. . . ""  Case closed.  Don't get me started on how painfully slow she was.  So much so that when we needed change for the tip my friend stated that he was going to the bar because ""she'll never come back."" I've been to this restaurant without incident several other times and have had a variety of wonderful and pleasant waiters/waitresses.  It's unfortunate that we were ""blessed"" with lonely or bet-driven service on this round.  Fortunately, this will not keep me from future bowls of baked potato soup :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-somerset-4?start=20

Nessa M.,"Bristol, RI",35,86,1,1.0,1/3/2011,"I decided to go here because I have a gift card to Chili's. It's pretty sad when you're RELUCTANT to go to a restaurant when the meal is going to be FREE. I didn't even get to the food portion it was so bad. I showed up the day after New Year's only to be told it was a 20-25minute wait...for two people. That is ridiculous. I've worked in restaurants before...it's never 20-25minutes for TWO PEOPLE. That long of a wait means you people clearly do not understand how to run a restaurant. Oh, and let's talk about the blonde ditz hostess who could not explain to me why the wait was so long. I asked her why only the bar portion and about 5 tables were being served...while the entire right side of the restaurant was vacant. She answered me by saying, ""Well, we don't want you to have to wait so long for food"". Ok...so instead you're going to have me wait 25 minutes to SIT DOWN? The entrance way was VERY uncomfortably full. There was literally a WAIT for the ditz hostess to tell you there was a WAIT.  I then asked her if we could sit at the bar while we waited...there were at least 5 visible seats available at the bar. She then told us that the bar was full and there weren't enough waitresses to serve us. I pointed out that if we sat at the bar, the BARTENDER would be serving us...she disagreed with me? Am I missing something?? I spoke with the manager, another complete ditz. She said that they were understaffed because 2 separate staff members got into 2 separate car accidents. First off, that is probably bs, and considering what followed...it's definitely bs. I then asked her how 2 people could possibly wait on 30 tables. (Mind you, there were at least 10 parties waiting in line...this was not an unreasonable question) Then she said well, 3 people actually called out. So I asked, oh...so 3 car accidents then? And she replied, ""Yeah, freak coincidence"". I then tried to explain to her that her managerial skills were lacking a bit, I also explained a more efficient way to manage things, to which she gave me an attitude and I hung up with her.
