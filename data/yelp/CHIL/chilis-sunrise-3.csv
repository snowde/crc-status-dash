M. R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,17,12,3.0,11/8/2017,We were looking for a restaurant with good food and modest prices and Chili's fit the bill. Three of us had half rack of ribs with one side and the other two had a burger. Everyone enjoyed their food. The restaurant was clean and for a Sunday evening not over crowded. The only thing I didn't like was the food came out very slow. I think Sunday night being a slow night there is probably less help. I will go back again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sunrise-3
Kerry B.,"Sunrise, FL",428,190,2352,3.0,1/12/2017,"Oh Chili's, you are not my favorite... Yet I love your decent food, good service, and alright beer selection.  I wish I could give you more stars.  Unfortunately I can't because I can never check into my Yelp when I visit you.  For some reason my phone will never connect to Yelp in this Chili's.  In fact, my phone really doesn't work at all here. Gives me more time to drink beer, but less time to catch up on my social media addictions.  So for this you lose a star.  And really you needed that extra star, because reading some of the other reviews, you can use all the stars you can get. Seriously though, I usually only sit at the bar, and the one time l sat at one of the tables near the bar, the air was blasting so cold that I was really uncomfortable. If I sound whiny or cranky in this review, just know it is not my normal state.  Check out my profile Kerry B.   For the record I like this location, especially the staff... BUT reception really sucks here. No, really it sucks!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sunrise-3
Tiffany T.,"Hollywood, FL",0,8,,5.0,11/1/2017,"My boyfriend and I love Chili's - we're like an old couple who always go to the same place and order the same thing. This review is specifically about our last visit. Busy Sunday evening and our server was a young blonde girl whose name I didn't catch. She seemed to be working every table on our side of the restaurant but she was so pleasant and came back to check on all of her tables more than servers even typically do! The table across from us stopped her every single time she walked by but she was in such good humor. Great experience, hope you all can figure out who I'm talking about (it was this past Sunday night) and let her know how appreciated she is. Side note to Chili's in general though - please add at least one vegetarian (or at least fish) option to your 2 for 22!!!! I'm missing the mango tilapia and am really disappointed that nothing I can eat replaced it",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sunrise-3

Amy S.,"Tamarac, FL",204,545,1836,3.0,11/16/2016,"Easy, quick meal on the run. Chili's is not my first choice for an evening out but this wasn't my usual relaxing dinner.  We were trying to eat quickly so my daughter could get back to studying. We started with chips, guac and salsa which was great and followed it with the original baby backs, again yummy.  The food was all good and very satisfying. The service was adequate and the server was pleasant but appeared to be spread thin.  The hostess was also a server so we had to wait for her to have a moment to seat us. This is atypical Chili's and is doing as well as I would expect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sunrise-3

Mister S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,41,,1.0,10/5/2017,"Never again!!! I ordered 2 margaritas 1 on the rocks & 1 frozen. they both came on the rocks. Then I ordered the spiced panko onion rings, it came out so bunrt and dry that even the server noticed and offered to take it back. Next I ordered the loaded boneles wings, it would've been ok if it wasn't breaded. however the biggest disappointment came with the crispy fiery pepper crispers. I like spicy but this was breaded chicken smothered with a sickly sweet glaze and some spice thown in. I don't want sugar in everything I eat!!! This place is basically a fast food restaurant with restaurant prices! the only decent thing was the corn on the cob. I would have been better off eating at McDonald or Burger King and it would have been cheaper too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sunrise-3

We had ordered 2 lunch meals. The burger came at first. Kim told us fries would come out shortly, we had asked to make sure they were hot, fajitas came out next ( we were now done with the burger and then the fries came out last.

Jeff G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,50,127,2.0,2/5/2017,"So it's the middle of the afternoon ,super bowl Sunday. The place wasn't  busy . My wife and I were seated near the waitress  ( waiter ) station . As we sat at our table , we had lots of time to review menu, front to back , back to front , even the new B-q menu pick 3 , pick 4 meats then  back to regular menu,lots of time . When a waitress came over to our table , only to bring silverware (no napkins) and in form us "" some one will be here shortly "". Remember , we were right next server station . Another server came to our table , she seemed embarrassed and asked us if we wanted to order drinks , while we were waiting ( no napkins ) . More time past, we re-read the menu again waiting , front to back and....back to front.  A waiter came over with our drinks ,finally , he was asking if we need more time to decide .We quickly responded-NO! we were ready and in flash our waiter disappeared (no napkins ) . Time past . more time past ......and more time past. Another server came to our table carrying what was ... almost our order ... OK , here's the fun part eating at this Chili's , they like play "" Lets get it right- maybe "" . The original server brought the food to the right table ( he thought it wasn't ours from our reaction to what was on the plates ) he took it back to the kitchen. My wife ordered the 6 oz. Classic Sirloin (medium cooked )with Grilled Avocado, it was supposed to come with citrus chili sauce ,topped with grilled avocado slices, garlic roasted tomatoes (grape style ) , chopped cilantro and fresco salad sounds good doesn't it . Mine was the Grass Fed Sunrise Burger ( medium cooked)- bacon , cheese , fried egg ....no onion and swapped the fries for corn on cob, yum right ? . A little while later , another person came out wearing chef's outfit carrying the same plates of food ( 2x  now ) and around 45 min have past since we were seated. He looked confused , like what he was holding in his hands is what we ordered . My wife's plate had a sirloin steak on it with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. When my wife mention the avocado and salad , his face showed exasperation in understanding what she was explaining. Mine was easy , no fries just corn on the cob- yes this really did happen , you cant make this up( still no napkins ). He left and few minutes later the disappearing waiter came back with our food ( no napkins  yet). The salad they put on wife's plate was a garden salad warmed up by chef micro , including the tomato slices not the garlic roasted (grape style ) tomatoes in the   citrus , no cilantro and worse of all they ruined a good piece of meat by over cooking it , past well done , not medium like my wife would have liked, sad . My burger was over cooked as well , not medium . the corn was like mush , over cooked . As i bit into the burger i tasted a large amount of salt , some much that i was looking for drink but i didn't have one because our disappearing waiter never ask if I needed another drink nor could i ask for one. I took the burger apart , thinking it might be the bacon -no the beacon didn't have the same intense taste.  Another piece of good meat ruined as well I told my wife. when we had finished our plates , our disappearing waiter came back ! I quickly ordered dessert - molten chocolate cake -that was really good . At this point our waiter did ask if needed something to drink- that' s after I had nothing with my burger. We use to go to this Chili's a lot but slowly the the service got bad , the food got bad . The quality of the food got bad. They remodeled this Chili's and we gave it shot but the only thing that changed was the building  .The only reason we come here now is when some one gives us gift cards during the holidays. Other wise we steer clear of this place . With some many other places in area , why put up with this kind of service and food . If you do come here- caveat emptor-sold as is-total time 1 hour 21 minutes for 2 . if your experience is better , great!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sunrise-3?start=20

No biggie, I took my time doing a few things at home, arrived at the restaurant at 8p. Waited for about 5 min before anyone even asked me if I had been helped. I paid for my food and then waited until 8:18p when I finally got my food.  I could understand if I had ordered something complex, or had several entrees on my order. I got the quesadilla explosion salad.  A salad shouldn't take 55 min to get.  The dining area wasn't busy at all, there were plenty of open tables which tells me that they weren't that busy.  Not good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sunrise-3?start=20

Can't complain about the food or drink - When you go to a chain restaurant you tend to know what to expect. The waiter was very friendly and attentive.

I'm not used to eating frozen, greasy food so everything went down the wrong way and my stomach hurt the whole day. Taco Bell has better food than this place so the next time I'm in a mega hurry, I rather go to TB. Yes, this place is worse than fast food. Yeah, the food here is more bar food than anything else but then it's just so bad. Chili's offers gross mediocre food. I don't consider this a real restaurant. I've had drinks here before and that's probably the only thing I'll ever order from here again. Some places make them ok, some make them blah. What else can I say? Oh yeah, I ordered take out online, came in 25 mins later and then they started cooking my order.  I don't recommend any food from here. I ordered about 6 different things from the menu and no body enjoyed anything, not even the onion rings. I wouldn't eat here again if they paid me to. No, really, I wouldn't. I'd take the gift card to Walmart for some store credit. I rather eat at the mall's food court that has better food.

Literally. They were loaded with cheese, bacon and jalapenos, and I could feel my arteries clogging as I ate them, but in the most delightful of ways that can only be triggered by bacon.  My main complaint about Chili's is that the food is more ""greasy bar food"" than ""kinda classy sit-down restaurant,"" but if that's what you're going for, this location provides exactly that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sunrise-3?start=40

The Togo girl told us she ""thinks they are in there"", and thought that was sufficient enough for us to leave happy! My boyfriend asked her to check to make sure, and, shockingly enough, they were not in there. She came back with one extra side of sauce (we needed three different ones for different entrees!) and then acted very annoyed she has to get the rest.

Pros:   The drinks were decent here, most of the time Chili's fails in this department. The food was ok, nothing special,  Fajitas were meh, but edible . . . the Quesidilla Explosion Salad was good. Sitting at a table in the bar area, the waitress let me get my 2 for 1 drinks one at a time . . . though she did sound hesitant about it. Cons: The waitress was nice, and I know it was 4th of July, but she was waiting on 6 tables at the bar, and she was the bartender for 6 people sitting at the bar.  Give the girl a break.  Before leaving, my nosey butt overhead the waiter who just got on shift tell a just sitting down couple they were out of a certain ""agave"" and couldn't make the margarita they wanted . . . . I mean really?  This place prides themselves on their margaritis . . . it is only 2 p.m. . . . and you can't even make the drink they want?  Not cool, would have rated this place a 2 if it happened to me. But for a Chili's it's more than acceptable, and ideal for cheap food after having to deal with the Sawgrass crowds.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sunrise-3?start=40
Michael S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",301,414,457,1.0,8/2/2010,"This location is horrible. I've been here many times and I can say for sure, I'll never go back.  This last time, I ate lunch in the bar. The waiter didn't seem to like us or his job. Everyone around us got our food, we waited 45-60mins to get sandwiches. Asking for more chips and salsa, was like pulling teeth. The worst part of the experience was that I broke out in hives after eating the chicken alvacado wrap. I also got super sick. Maybe it was allergic to some ingredient but the fact was, the service SUCKED.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sunrise-3?start=40

Patty W.,"Lake Worth, FL",280,1063,1750,3.0,10/22/2010,"2-4-1's all day every day.  The service was alright since it was a kinda busy Friday night.  We didn't have to wait long for our table and our waiter seem like he was happy working there.  The southwestern egg rolls were kind of spicy, but a nice kick to it overall.  I had the bacon ranch chicken southwestern quesadillas, which was a huge portion.  They were great.  I had to take half of it home, which means less cooking and more time to yelp ;)  The white chocolate molten cake was pleasant and sweet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sunrise-3?start=40
Lilliam O.,"Plantation, FL",0,1,,1.0,9/19/2013,Came at 2 pm with my son and it wasn't packed and it took over 5 minutes for hostess to come and say hello! She took us to our table. Slow service. Appetizers which I ordered chips took more than 10 minutes. Food took a long time taking in consideration that it wasn't rush hour. Food came in and she didn't even notice we were out of drinks so I had to tell her. No silverware at the table had to wait more time. Took forever to come back to ask the famous question how's everything? At least food was good. We waited more than 15 minutes for the check to come in. And another 15 to bring receipt.  I love Chilis but this location really provides bad service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sunrise-3?start=40
Max I.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,4,,2.0,11/9/2015,"I've been to other Chili's a few times and by far this one was the worst. The service was ok but the food is the main problem. I don't know if people go to Chili's for the baby back ribs anymore, but I went there with my family and friend hoping to get a nice rack of juicy ribs. My mother ordered a burger and my father had quesadillas which were amazing. And my friend had chicken fajitas. To start off with the appetizer, it was okay. We had the usual chips w/ salsa which is always on top of things, but the entrees is where the experience took a nose dive. My ribs came out very nice but sadly it did not taste well as I thought it would. The ribs had so much sauce and it was not juicy at all. On ribs, you would expect ribs to have some sort of transparent and more liquid looking sauce, but instead, these baby back ribs had sauce that had more of a texture as tomato sauce. The taste was okay but it tasted like there was way too many kinds of spices that didn't mix well. The fries though were good as usual. My mother ordered a medium-well burger with french fries. What came out, was the opposite. Instead of a cheeseburger (which is the easiest thing to cook on a grill) it appeared cooked on the outside, but when split with a knife, you could see that almost the entire inside of the burger was completely raw and not cooked at all. My friend's chicken fajitas also came with no onions and veggies even though my friend asked for no onions. He asked for no onions because he probably knew that from every restaurant in the U.S. that offers fajitas, they always put more veggies, then the chicken itself to put into a tortilla. My friend had no problem with the chicken except for the size of the portion and ratio between veggies and chicken. The service though was below average then expected. The manager was nice enough to give us a 50% discount off the burger, even though she couldn't eat one bite. The waitress though did not seem to thrilled. My father worked as a bus boy for years and then a waiter for even more years and always treated customers nicely. This waitress acted like she did not want to even be at the restaurant. But, I give her a break because of the time change in Florida and it was 7:46 at night even though it appeared to be 8:46 at night. Overall, I hope this Chili's steps up their game because my mother did not want to go to this Chili's because she just doesn't like their food and I told her their food is amazing and it tastes delicious. Afterward, she said she was never going back. I hope to convince her to go to a different Chili's one day, but for now, change needs to be made.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sunrise-3?start=40
