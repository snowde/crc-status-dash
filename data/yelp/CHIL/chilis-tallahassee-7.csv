Jonathan R.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",47,145,335,3.0,12/12/2016,If this is the one right on FSU campus then bravo.  Nice server and very large.  Clean bathrooms and typical Chilis food. Good Mexican at affordable prices.  Amazing location inside FSU.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tallahassee-7
Ruth B.,"Jacksonville, FL",110,209,605,2.0,7/26/2016,"The worse Chilis ever! Greasy chips, so so every thing else. Freso salad was unimpressive, the BLT again only so so, maybe just not great on an over buttered pretzel bun. They tried to bill me separately for our three salads which came with the lunch special then the manager corrected the bill but didn't take off the complete over charge which was 11.67 but took off 11.50- rounding?Disappointed - maybe since it is located on FSU campus they think it's ok to be mediocre. Won't ever go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tallahassee-7
Devin D.,"Key Largo, FL",594,3,,1.0,4/18/2017,"This is the worst chili's I've ever gone to and as a franchise they should shut it down. Took our order 45 minutes after we got there, gave us our margaritas 30 minutes later when they were completely melted and brought our food out cold. Also wouldn't take FSU cash even though they're on campus and say they do. Will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tallahassee-7
Cote L.,"Tallahassee, FL",142,41,22,3.0,2/17/2017,"While Chili's will always just be another chain restaurant, this one is a little above the rest for me. I have only been here a couple times but each time was pretty good. The service has always been pleasant and fast and the food was just fine. Happy Hour deals are good with BOGO margaritas which are excellent by the way. This place is always clean and with a college student staff, everything has run smoothly for me so far. All in all, this Chili's is much better than the one on the Parkway.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tallahassee-7
Bianca B.,"Clearwater, FL",1,2,3,2.0,10/2/2016,"Had a couple great experiences here, but also had a couple bad experiences. One time the food I ordered was cold, once a friend of mine waited an hour for her food. Overall this Chili's is a hit or a miss.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tallahassee-7
Kate B.,"Tallahassee, FL",223,175,294,2.0,7/27/2015,"I mean, Chili's is Chili's anywhere you go. Salty, fried food with decent drink specials.  This location in particular is usually a miss in my book. It's a popular lunch spot for faculty and staff on campus and gets very, very crowded on orientation days. Made that mistake once or twice :) Staff turnover is high with the exception of the super nice take-out guy.  The only noteworthy thing about this specific location is their alcohol policy! When our table's margaritas were overly syrup-y, we tried to send them back. The manager went on to explain that since FSU is a dry campus with the exception of this location, there is paperwork involved with issuing refunds for alcohol - or something of that nature. Nothing short of begging us to take coupons for free fajitas instead of taking the drinks off our tabs. Not a huge deal, they will remove if you really insist.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tallahassee-7
Sarah B.,"Spokane, WA",1,46,25,1.0,9/2/2015,"Went in for some birthday dinner and ordered a chicken quesadilla, no bacon. When the food came, it had bacon. I was initially fine with letting them know so it could be fixed, because it happens sometimes.  What happened next was the waiter brought the dish back out to tell me it was just that one quesadilla corner, and that the rest was fine. So I picked apart the quesadilla to show him that it was indeed full of bacon. Besides, the kitchen staff cannot possibly know my reasoning for wanting it without bacon, so why leave an order 'contaminated' if it had potential to make someone really, really sick? After the order was made again, the second quesadilla STILL had bacon in it. When I pointed this out to the waiter, his response was that it looked like burnt cheese to him. So again, I dug out the hunks of bacon so he could see it was there. I ended up just deciding to pick the bacon bits out piece by piece instead of waiting again for another quesadilla. Aside from this one also having bacon in it, it had maybe 3 pieces of chicken for the entire 8 piece quesadilla.   Now, previously at the same Chili's, I've gotten free dessert for having a small wait (maybe only 20 minutes or so), but despite it being my birthday, and despite having been there 2 and a half, almost 3 hours (not to mention the incorrect order, twice), we still ended up paying for dessert, and we were told ""nothing is given away for free."" Additional: A nearby table was given dessert (with candles) and waiters sang happy birthday. Immediately after, when our waiter came back, I informed him it was my birthday as well and asked about the free dessert, but of course, ""nothing is given away for free,"" despite Chili's constantly sending ""buy an entree get a free dessert or appetizer"" coupons to my e-mail. No candles came on dessert, and no one sang :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tallahassee-7
Ann C.,"Madeira-Redington, Tampa Bay, FL",87,10,4,2.0,2/14/2016,"I love that this is right on campus but it's a hit or miss. One of the worst Chilis I've been too. While the service is always good, the waiters are always kind, but the food always disappoints.  On top of that they can never figure out how to split checks properly. Tried paying for a Togo order with two cards evenly, they charged my card for the two even amounts three times! And this was the manager. What is so hard about not swiping the same card twice! By the third time I said forget about it and my friend just gave me cash. Kitchen and computer system needs some upgrades please!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tallahassee-7
Basel B.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,19,,2.0,3/14/2017,"The sit down dining experience is always pleasant, but the bar and/or take out experiments are usually a disappointment at best, disastrous at worst. Missing silverware, wrong orders, long waits, non existent staff at bar. Will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tallahassee-7
Gordon S.,"Tampa, FL",0,6,,2.0,3/18/2016,"Not prepared for Freshman Preview day; apparently busier than normal. About 10 minutes to get greeted. 32 minutes for food to arrive. Medium steak came out beyond well done, but no time to ask for for a recook. Server was very pleasant and apologetic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tallahassee-7
Bill S.,"Delray Beach, FL",487,808,642,3.0,11/14/2013,"This Chili's is located on the campus of FSU in the Student Union area. The restaurant is surprisingly large and can accommodate pretty large groups. The hamburgers and fries were pretty good, but not incredible. If you are looking for a place to have lunch or dinner while on campus of FSU, this is a good option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tallahassee-7
Marie F.,"Lantana, FL",227,903,3384,3.0,2/11/2013,"Only place you can get alcohol and a meal on campus. It took a lot of fighting to bring this on and it's really not any better then the other chain restaurants you will find in other locations, except on Game Days! The wait becomes ridiculous! The staff seems to rotate regularly and in effect so does their quality in customer service and food preparation. It really is a hit or miss.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tallahassee-7
Josh P.,"Plant City, FL",76,1,,5.0,3/12/2016,Love this Chili's! The food is great and the servers are dedicated to working and making your meal special. My server Courtney was super friendly and everything was swell. She's so hot.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tallahassee-7
Katherine M.,"Tallahassee, FL",56,74,44,3.0,12/22/2012,"Chili's on FSU campus is always hit or miss. It's usually something like this: 1) You get there and the wait is ridiculous because all the college kids are starving and tired of going to the dining halls so then the wait for your food is crazy long and the service is really bad because there are so many people there. By the time you get your crazy food and you ordered some type of vegetable, particularly the broccoli, and it's cold, but the rest of your food is the usual Chili's delicious and you're over it. Then it comes time to pay, you can't find your waiter anywhere and then it takes them two seconds to get you the heck out of there because they need to free up the table for the other people. OR! 2) You go on a week night and it gets a little better. I have never had the same waiter more than once at this particular Chili's, but the food gets a little better when it's not so crowded. Good place to have a friendly dinner with someone DURING THE WEEK and just kinda catch up. The menu is gigantic so unless you are not looking to have an American dish then you can do no wrong by coming to Chili's. The bar is awesome though and I have gotten pretty decent drink recommendations from the wait staff. All in all it's a chain restaurant. I go in with okay expectations and try not to get mad when it's packed and I can't hear the person in front of me. Good college ambiance though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tallahassee-7
