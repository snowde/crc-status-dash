Boon C.,"Tampa, FL",363,1504,8724,3.0,5/16/2016,"This my neighborhood Chili. Very Caliente. When we walk out at 8:30 pm, there are people waiting to get a table. Popular for the local resident. I always like chili fajitas. But lately they have change about the meat cut. The seasoning is still there. Today the flour tortilla is about a bit dry. Which mean they have not steam it completely. This just need a few second more and they will be ok. My wife have the chicken pasta. It is good taste.  I always start with strawberry lemonade with my soft drink. At the refill, I am asking to change to blackberry ice tea then change to mango ice tea. Sometime they have watermelon lemonade. I have 3 different drink in one order. The strawberry lemonade also dilute down. They use to have the strawberry seed. Now they don't.  The service at the bar area is quick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa

Heather E.,"Wauseon, OH",1,7,,1.0,9/4/2017,"Walked in to Chili's hoping for a great lunch with margaritas, all to sit in a booth for an hour with no drinks and no silverware even after putting in an order.

David B.,"Valrico, FL",36,33,10,4.0,5/30/2017,Chili's is a greatly underrated and sometimes overlooked restaurant chain. With the never frozen burger patties and great chips and guacamole..

Ann L.,"Tampa, FL",22,1,14,4.0,8/21/2017,"New Tampa has the best Chili's by far. The staff are friendly & helpful. The variety on the menu makes it where we pop in once or twice a week.

Debbie K.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",0,9,,4.0,7/10/2017,Went there and we both ordered the combo steak and shrimp fajitas.  They were quite good and hit the spot.  Had not been to Chili's in awhile and noticed they revamped the menu.  Service was good and the place was pleasantly unpacked at 2:00 to 3:00 pm on a Sunday.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa

When i ordered a molten ($7) i was told they were out so I got 2 mini moltens instead($5) but still paid full price for the item.

Diane G.,"Tampa, FL",117,291,115,3.0,9/19/2014,"I have mixed feelings about this place, but my son loves coming here and we always enjoy our time together. Our servers are always friendly and attentive, and the food is pretty typical for a chain restaurant. Our servers usually remember us (especially my son), and they go out of their way to entertain and please him, which always makes mom happy. I would not recommend deviating from the menu in any way, because you can never tell what that is going to cost you. The recent addition of the table tablet/kiosk is nice, although not fully functional for ordering. My son and I use it to play virtual boggle, which for 99 cents (added to your bill) is extremely reasonable for an hour or more of laughing, playing, and bonding with your child. I do love their chips and salsa, probably my favorite chips (I wish they'd revise their salsa and make it chunkier, more flavorful, and less tomato saucey)....they are complimentary when you sit in the bar in area (we usually get a high top table, no waiting if there is space). We don't normally order full meals...we usually only get the chips and salsa, me a few glasses of wine, and he a dessert. He loves the giant skillet chocolate chip cookie with ice cream and the chocolate lava cake...they are big enough for 3 people. When we do order food, he loves the grilled cheese and I am partial to the spicy shrimp tacos and the pork carnitas fajitas (although I don't  believe the later is in the menu anymore).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa
Scott S.,"Temple Terrace, Tampa Bay, FL",46,52,76,4.0,5/9/2016,"My original plan was to actually cook my mom dinner, it was Mother's Day after all. Sadly, those plans were scrapped due to the consumption of too many beverages by the pool, so we were unfortunately going out. Fun fact-Mother's Day is one of the worst days to go out to eat. I should know-I've worked in the restaurant business for the past 13 years.  Chili's wasn't exactly her first choice; the 3 other places we tried beforehand averaged 90 minutes for a table. To my surprise, there was no wait. At all.  We sat right down and were greeted right away.  The smothered smoked chicken burrito was outstanding, to the point where I didn't realize I hadn't snapped a pic of it until I was halfway through it. Since I'm glutton for punishment, I continued my beverage intake with some mango Presidente margaritas. Sure, it wasn't Bern's or Ulele, but she didn't want all that. She just wanted to have a good meal with her son without fighting a mob of people, and that's what she got.  Then, The Lightning won.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa

The food at chili's has never been great but this experience will be our last one with them.  We took my son to the New Tampa chili's for his birthday at his request.  We arrived early (before 6:00pm) in order to eat and see an 8:00pm movie. It took over an hour for our food to arrive an when it did, everything was over cooked and dry. We mentioned it to our server and she completely ignored the situation. I finally stopped our waitress after watching my husband chicken down the swill they served us and asked her to redo his meal.  At this point, we were running late, my husband was disgusted, and we were over the whole experience.

James N.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",19,30,11,1.0,3/5/2012,"I used to love Chili's, especially their mushroom jack fajitas. Recently though, I have been very disappointed with their service. In the last few times I have gone, the service has been poor overall and the food has been lack-luster. The last time I went though, I was driven away for the last time. When we were waiting on our food, I noticed that there was a dead cockroach on the window sill right next to our table. After pointing this out to a staff person (either a manger or host, they never said), they picked it up with their fingers, dropped it, picked it up again and walked away. There was never a word said to us, never an apology rendered, never a mention of the incident at all. I even took the internet survey to let them know and they never got back to me. After that, I started looking closer and every table was dirty, there a dozen or more other bugs on window sills around me, and everything was sticky. I was disappointed not only with the condition of the restaurant, as it was not busy and someone could have definitely cleaned up, but also with the lack of response of the staff to my complaint. I hope that things will change, but I will not be going back and neither will anyone that I know that I have talked to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa?start=40

Chris W.,"Tampa, FL",496,522,3994,4.0,12/17/2014,"I must have missed the memo.  When did Chili's get much better?  I haven't been in a Chili's in years and begrudgingly went to dinner here.  I was surprised to see a nice, modern looking restaurant.  All of the tchotchkes hanging from the wall/ceiling (ala Cracker Barrell) I'm used to seeing at Chili's were gone and the place looked really nice.  They had a special that we happily took advantage of.  For $20 two people can split an appetizer (hello bottomless chips and salsa!) and then each get a full-sized entree.  That is one good deal and the food wasn't half bad either!  The most impressive thing to me were the touchscreen units that were present on each table.  It's so annoying when you are done with your meal and want to leave but can't because you either haven't gotten the bill or the server hasn't come back with your credit card.  When we were ready to go I was able to swipe my credit card in the unit, select a tip amount, and get a printed receipt.  It couldn't have been faster or more efficient.  The touchscreens also can serve as a distraction for your children.  For a buck you can let them play Peggle, Bejeweled, etc.  Sure you could argue that you could just buy those games on your phone for a dollar, but your phone isn't tied up while the kids are playing.  I think it's brilliant!  This was a surprisingly good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa?start=20

We decided to stop in on a Wednesday night and sit at a booth in the bar area. They have these cool touchscreens you can use to order (great in theory, poorly executed in practice) but ours was broken. We waited awhile for service and ordered the Presidente Margarita and one of their new Watermelon Vodka Coolers. YUCK! So overly sugary and barely any alcohol and not on the 2 for 1 special so therefore overpriced. We ordered guacamole for our chips, which came out the same time as our meal. I got the chicken fajitas and they were bland and lacking that special something. I was seriously disappointed.

After almost a year, I figured I'd give it another try. That was my mistake. I was in a party of two. There was no line at the door so we walked in and sat on the bar side, after being greeted by a rather confused hostess. It took a long time for our waitress to take our drink orders. We ordered our appetizer which came with barely any sauce. There were two other parties that sat down after us but got their food first. When our food came out my fajitas were colder than normal. Usually they would be smoking which I was able to compare to the person's order to the table beside us.

I was brave enough to come back but since the macaroni grill closed at night this place is so dark and hard to find.
