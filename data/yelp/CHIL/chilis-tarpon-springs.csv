Suzanne Z.,"Cleveland, OH",0,2,2,1.0,9/12/2015,Service is slow and nothing is clean. Especially those screens you have to touch. Food is same as all the other chili's. Although the table near us had something bad and called the manager over. I needed to wash my hands after touching the pay screen and was surprised the bathroom was cleaner than my table.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarpon-springs?start=40
S S.,"Holiday, Tampa Bay, FL",0,8,,1.0,8/8/2015,"The new menu is horrible. They have added cilantro to almost everything. It's been proven that almost 20% of the population hates cilantro based on a genetic disposition that has to do with your sense of smell. Seriously the cilantro ""craze"" will have made this last trip to Chili's my last trip. I commend you for trying something new, but the research is out there that states clearly how a large portion of the population physically can't tolerate cilantro.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarpon-springs?start=40

Alex J.,"New Port Richey, FL",0,5,,1.0,5/31/2013,"I probably had the worst lunch I've ever eaten at a restaurant at this Chili's today.  I don't know when they started serving reheated chicken with their fajitas but they're completely tasteless.  We asked her to burn the peppers and onions and chicken a little, and they were barely warm when served much less crispy.  The guacamole was brown so we pointed that out and the manager brought out another bowl and it was just as bad.  ""We make it fresh here every day"" my fat behind.  The server was really bad, very slow.  No wonder American businesses are in the toilet, no one cares to make a decent product anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarpon-springs?start=40
Wendy B.,"Shelbyville, MI",14,7,,3.0,4/8/2012,"Got their new 6oz garlic sirloin, not so good.  My iced tea tasted old.  The only good thing was the chips and Guac.  The manager did take care of a portion of the bill for the experience.  They used to be so good, not not so much 100% of the time.  I'll give it 1 more shot, before I stay away for good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarpon-springs?start=40
Linda N.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,7,,1.0,12/18/2011,"We have gone to this Chili's many times and usually have good service and a good meal until last night. Honestly the worst meal ever.... our ribs were overcooked and really dry, the vegetables were overcooked, and the chips were totally overcooked. The service was horrible. The excuse we received from our service was; ""it's only my second day"". Well then, don't serve!!! the Manager took the ribs off our meal, we left, and went home to eat.

Suzie C.,"Palm Harbor, Tampa Bay, FL",1,1026,196,5.0,12/16/2017,"Stopped in for a late lunch. No-one was at the door so we sat at the bar. She greeted us almost immediately and brought us our water. We ordered and our soup was brought out quickly. The southwest soup is simply perfect here. I could of had three more bowls of that and been very very happy. But, I had a mex bowl to eat too. It was 'ok.' Too much rice. Not enough lettuce. But a fair amount of chicken. The food was hot which is what I like the best. The flavor was very good which is why there is a five star review. We would definitely return. Our experience here was very positive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarpon-springs
Leah M.,"Palm Harbor, FL",2,39,60,2.0,7/14/2017,"Chilis is always just a decent place. But tonight, we had a rude server named Ashley. We were seated and waited 15 minutes and the manager finally came over and took our order since Ashley was taking orders of people who sat after us. Ashley then told us our wings would be right out. So five minutes later we asked her where our wings were and she yelled saying they take 15 minutes and they were on minute 10. The manager then came and served us the wings and said they can take 15 to 20 minutes which is horrible because they take less then five to cook. We finally then received our steaks which I love the steak with the avacado! Overall the food was good but staff was rude and the food took longer then it should of. Oh and I never receive my Plenti points at Chilis even though I put in my phone number.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarpon-springs
Ashley C.,"Sparks, NV",25,3,,1.0,12/5/2017,"So I made an order online... It said my pick up time was in 23 mins, I had an errand to run so that gave me plenty of time to do that... when I got there I waited for almost 10 minutes before I went inside to see what was taking so long. I found there was no one inside and found that they were still not done with my order. So I asked for a bowl of soup to be added to my order, however I had already paid online with my card and she told me it couldn't be done. So you're meaning to tell me that a chain like Chili's cannot start a separate tab just for a cup of soup? I even had the cash on me! Terrible service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarpon-springs

I had the spicy pasilla  chile chicken that was cooked to almost perfection and husband and a very well prepared and cook ribeye. We were both very satisfied with our meal selections. We will return to this location again. Kudos to chilies in Tarpon Springs for a meal well done!  12/9/16 update apparently there have been some changes and turnover in staff.

Erica S.,"Dunedin, FL",19,5,,5.0,9/2/2017,This restaurant had great service. Several food options that could be made vegan.

Service has always been nothing short of attentive and efficient.  Drink refills were constantly served.  The menu is extensive and at normal chain restaurant prices. I would definitely suggest checking out this Chili's next time you're looking. The burgers are juicy, hot, and tasty.

Shannon R.,"Holiday, Tampa Bay, FL",553,86,396,5.0,3/7/2016,"I usually stay away from chain restaurants but I have to say, this Chili's has a special place in my heart. Managers Brooke and Micah are always delightful and very active in their restaurant. The food is consistently excellent, with a balanced fresh flavors and some of the best darn burgers in town. The lunch service is fast but still friendly so if you are looking for a quick bite with out going the fast food route I would highly recommend stopping by. Take out is always fast and reliable. If you dine in you absolutely have to get the table side guac. It is so delicious and they hand mix all of the fresh ingredients right in front of you. The flavor is unparalleled.

Andrea P.,"Tarpon Springs, FL",100,47,4,1.0,11/30/2016,"My co workers and I often order lunch together a few times a week , since we love Chilis we decided to do curb side . We placed our order online and then called to tweak it since there was not any room to do so on the order (Making sure bacon was crispy , and adding drinks) . Upon receiving the order it was nothing but problems , burnt burger with not crispy bacon , the bacon looked like it was just sliced off the pig , the soup was ice cold and clumped together you could hardly move the spoon in it which is upsetting because chilis normally has really good potato soup , the salad was supposed to have cojita cheese on it and there was absolutely none , i would of paid less for a garden salad if i didn't want that cheese . Ice cold side of broccoli , and the worst was the 2orders of  corn on the cob  i understand putting some spice on it although there ""new version "" of corn on the cob does not state that on the menu but the spices were litteraly burnt to a crisp on both ears of corn on the cob  , and my other coworkers meal was also ice cold and in edible . We waited longer than when they said it would be ready all to have cold and burnt food . The best yet our bill was $55 to be completely dissatisfied and then not even have a lunch to eat during our ten hour days we pull so of course i called the manager , he said he would "" take care of it ""  .. TWO WEEKS later we received $15 in chilis bucks in the mail today, which does not even begin to cover the $55 worth of mistakes . That is horrible customer service have someone pay $55 for meals and give them $15 in return , what amount of cold or burnt food could three people receive for that ? To think we were actually going to give another try , clearly we need to take our business else where so we can receive hot cooked food and good customer service .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarpon-springs?start=20

Brandon P.,"Clearwater, FL",7,94,4,1.0,1/31/2016,"Horrible Chili's location. I decided to come here last night with some family and friends. I ordered the new grilled chicken burrito. My wife ordered a side salad and my uncle and friend shared the fajitas. Food came and at first glance my burrito shared more similarities of a small crunch wrap from taco bell than a burrito. Now come on, a burrito isn't hard to make but somehow was not made right. The fajitas weren't even sizzling when they came out. On top of that my cherry coke tasted funky and was told two tables behind me asked to cut off the ufc fight I was watching due to the blood. Really? What show or movie doesn't show some sort of blood now a days? Are you a hermit? Won't be going back to this chili's ever.

Lauren C.,"Dunedin, FL",124,741,216,2.0,12/30/2012,"I usually don't review corporate places like chilis because its generally the same at all locations, but my recent visit to this chilis calls for a review. I arrived with a friend and we sat at a booth in the bar. As soon as our server introduced himself, we knew what we were in for as we had remembered the last experience we had with him. He has got to be one of the most annoying servers of my entire life. First, he was attacking my friend and I with his relentless attempts to upsell on absolutely everything, clearly not understanding the phrase ""No thanks"". So this continued on throughout the evening, in addition to the fact that he kept making it seem like he was doing us amazing ""favors"" like bringing out extra salad dressing and burger toppings for no extra charge and bragging about it, but frankly I wasn't too impressed. The final straw was when he admitted to eavesdropping on the conversation my friend and I were having and responding with rude and unprofessional remarks that were absolutely unnecessary. I should have asked to speak with the manager. Overall the appetizers (chips and salsa, burger bites, pretzel sticks, boneless wings) and blackberry margaritas we got were excellent, so I can't diss chilis food at all, but next time I go there, most definitely will not be sitting in that guys section!!
