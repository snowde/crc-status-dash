Jon M.,"Murrieta, CA",0,12,,5.0,9/18/2017,"I'll be honest I'm generally not like oh let's go to chili's but I went for lunch today and the service was great. While we were shooting the breeze with our server she had keyed in our drinks on her tablet and they got delivered before we completed the order. We both had the lunch fajitas, just the right size portion.  Service was great and we didn't need to hit the refill button on the table tablet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temecula?start=20

The sanitation of the restaurant is excellent, but could use a little cleaning but overall it's a clean restaurant just do a touch up on areas. The bathroom was clean.

Angela P.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,165,117,3.0,7/31/2016,"Great service tonight.  Ivy kept the Drinks coming. Our food was hot, just not too flavorful.  Food: Burger was dry and gritty. Chips were undercooked. Three to eight tortillas deep fried together and not cooked in the middle--- gross. Our sweet server, Ivy brought us a new basket which were much better.

Wesley W.,"Temecula, CA",10,27,5,2.0,3/6/2016,"The Atacama Desert in South America is considered to be the driest place on earth. Officially my mouth is now the driest place on earth. The oceans called they want their salt back. Chili's, turn down the volume of salt in the food, please! The menu at chili's is vast but so is the canyon of salt they use to cook with. I can go on and on all day about the level of salt in their food. Why do they need to make everything so salty? A hamburger is delicious on its own merits, is it not? A chicken breast sandwich with all the topics taste great, doesn't it? So why all the salt? I guess it is to mask the quality of the meat they use. I am not sure but what ever the reason please stop.  Let me try and get off the topic of overly salted food and get to something more important. Flimsy nacho chips! Why? Chips and Salsa are one of the best things Mexican culture has ever given us. It is an attack on their culture to create meager chips and watery salsa. Your guacamole should be given a name change and just be called ""Pale Green Stew"". I can't say everything is bad. The servers have always been helpful. Especially now that you can pay with the on table kiosk. The drinks are good, the kind with alcohol of course. If you need a cheap place to drink with some co-workers or a night out with the friends, this is a good spot. I would have given it one star but I do like the appetizer menu. Sometimes it is my entire meal. Unless I want to be an unwanted addition to the Macy's day parade this year, I will be avoiding Chili's. Sorry!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temecula?start=20
Stacey B.,"Murrieta, CA",0,9,,2.0,1/12/2017,"I usually love Chili's food and they almost always have great service. This time was the exception. I went for lunch with a coworker on 1/10 at about 12:45. We sat at a 2 top booth in the bar. There were about 4 people sitting at the bar and 2 other 2 tops. Not busy. We were there at least 4 minutes before being greeted by the server. She was also the bartender, I have restaurant bar experience so I get that sometimes you get tied up. She finally said she would be right with us. Which was another 2 or 3 minutes. She finally came over to clean off the table and, instead of getting drink orders, walked away and cleaned another table. I should also mention she needs to learn the scoop and wipe trick on the tables if you have guests sitting at the table already. Luckily the table was clean or we would have crumbs in our laps. She finally took drink orders and, since we had so much time, we also knew our food order. We ordered the big mouth bites and quesadilla from what we thought was the $7 lunch menu. She brought the drinks and set them down without saying anything. When she came back I asked if she had a straw on her. She apparently mumbled something about it being in the little silverware packet, which I did not hear, and walked away. I repeated the question. She turned around and pointed at the packet with some serious snarky attitude. When the food arrived it was the full portion. We checked the bill and sure enough were charged for the regular menu price. We told her we thought we were ordering the lunch option. She says, ""well that comes with soup or salad and since you didn't say you wanted those things I assumed you wanted the regular option"". Listen, I don't work for Chili's. But she does. I don't know the menu without looking at it or without prompted questions. If someone is there during lunch and you have a lunch menu, wouldn't it be common courtesy to ask if they wanted the lunch or regular option? We only ate half of each anyway which is the lunch portion, cause that's all we wanted. So we asked her if it could be adjusted to the $7 price and she kind of just looked at it and said, ""well I can ask"" and stormed off then had someone else deliver the check. When she came back to get the plates I said thank you and she did not respond.  She just seemed annoyed the entire time. I didn't catch her name because she didn't care to offer it. She was kind of plain and had dark hair. I understand that we all have bad days but in the service industry, honey, you don't get to show it. A lot of times, your guests are there to escape their bad day. They don't need yours on top of it. On the plus, the food was good, which is why I gave the 2nd star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temecula?start=20
Patti S.,"Winchester, CA",0,3,1,5.0,3/16/2017,"Good food, fast service. Never had to wait for a table. A friend and I were talking about a sauce we didn't like. Guess someone heard us.

Alecia C.,"Murrieta, CA",63,5,,1.0,5/21/2017,"Food was cold. Ordered ribs and queso dip. I always get there queso, usually it's HOT and meaty. I think they changed the recipe it was basically just cheese that was lukewarm. The ribs were lukewarm as well and my broccoli barely steamed. My husband and I used to come here all the time, we loved it! I honestly don't think we'll ever be back. We got here at 11am they just opened! How are your ribs not hot!? It just shows that they're pre cooked.

Jasmine D.,"Temecula, CA",125,6,,2.0,6/25/2016,Chillis food is just not that great. I ordered the smoked smothered burrito which was supposed to be smothered with sour cream on top and when it came it was so dry. I had to ask for more sour cream to put inside. Our server (who's name I forgot) was not that friendly at all and at times M.I.A.  The queso dip with beans wasn't all that great either. Needless to say I don't really care for their food.  The strawberry lemonade is AMAZING though !!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temecula?start=20

Mindy W.,"San Diego, CA",5,30,6,1.0,10/7/2016,First the server was very rude about us being able to get happy hour at our table! The bar was jammed pack with one high table left.. not wanting to have my 5 year old on those kinds of tables. Then we told her that the manager already said that it was okay and she then argued and said.. wow really that shouldn't happen.. I then said yes the hosts asked him and she said wow she shouldn't have even asked!!! Really!! What kind of customer service is that!

OVERCHARGED on my bill.  Talked to the manager who ""fixed"" the bill...but added 2 small charges to the bill.  VERY frustrating!

My wife and I love to do the 2 for $35 deal included an appetizer, 2 entrees, dessert, and 2 margaritas. I seriously think that's one of the best deals in town.  The only downside at this place is definitely parking... it's shared with Black Angus customers so on a Friday or Saturday night, you might be circling for 10 minutes before you find a spot.

Ian W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,4,1.0,12/31/2017,Waited over 45 minutes before they told us it would be another 20-30 min before we could be seated. There were plenty of tables. They told us they were under staffed. Called across the street to Black Angus and asked if there was a wait. They said they could seat us immediately. So we enjoyed a great meal with great service.

Christa L.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",706,329,904,4.0,7/11/2017,"Yay!!  Chili's finally impressed!  I'm so glad to be upgrading my review from one to four stars!! I thought I had sworn off Chili's after a few horrible experiences, but we had a gift card and a long day, so it was a convenient option.  The hubs and I started off with a Cuervo Blue Margarita and it really hit the spot.  So refreshing! We both also decided to stick with the lite menu.  I'm really impressed when somebody makes a lite choice flavorful.  It's not that difficult but far too often, lite is interpreted as no flavor.  Chili's hit it out of the park with this.  I ordered the ancho salmon.  It was absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly...not overcooked and dry like I often end up receiving.  The veggies were also cooked to perfection, not too hard and not too mushy.  The hubs ordered the margarita chicken.  I tried it and it was equally delicious.  He enjoyed it so much that he wants to recreate the dish at home.  My son always orders the burger with the egg if it's on the menu.  So, he went with the grassfed sunrise burger.  He loved it!  Our service was also exceptional.  Everything about this visit was great.  Had this been my first visit I probably would've given five stars but it's really hard to forget my last experience.  However, Chili's definitely gained back my business and maybe that five star review is in the future.  Nice job!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temecula

I got the sunrise burger and it did not disappoint but it was extremely messy. The place was not very busy but we got stuck in the corner next to the kitchen, but it wasn't too noisy or anything.

Both excellent!  People who come here and expect good Mexican food must be out of their minds. It isn't a Mexican restaurant.

Kim L.,"El Cajon, San Diego, CA",15,6,2,1.0,9/10/2016,"Ok so this review is for a visit from about a month ago...DO NOT come here if you have a large party. We came in with about 22 adults for lunch one Saturday. We had made a reservation and had informed them that we would need separate checks. Upon being seated we asked for more of the tablets so we could have multiple people paying for checks at once and the server said she would split the checks and handle the payments because it would be easier and faster...well it WASN'T. It took her over an hour to split the checks, which were wrong and had to be fixed, and another 40 min to process them all. It was ridiculous. We had to involve management because it was taking so long and the manager was ZERO HELP. We were actually late for our event that we had all paid for already  because they were so unprepared to handle our group even though we made our reservations over a week in advance. On top of the check issue our general service was absolutely terrible, we had to go up to the bar to order drinks and ask the hostess for things multiple times because we rarely saw our server.

Fanny L.,"Los Angeles, CA",85,16,19,4.0,12/1/2014,Went for lunch today because the usual spot that I go to wasn't taking online orders (damn you Panera!). I found a Lighter Side steak item for just under 300 calories which is exactly what I need. I placed the order online and when I got there I was informed that my steak had been sitting out for about 40 min and was cold. The Asian guy at the front (Brandon?..) asked me if I had time for them to make me a new one. It only took about 10 min to make and it was pretty good. I was really impressed with the staff and their ability to be proactive and resolve something that could have potentially been an issue. He even offered me something to drink while I waited. It's the little things that go a long way.... Good lookin' out Chili's!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temecula?start=40

After a few more pecks it picked up the rat and flew away with it in its beak. It was the most disgusting and hilarious thing you would never expect to see right away after we sat down. On the food... if you want remotely decent Mexican food go to a Mexican restaurant not Chili's.

Also We wanted a dessert but I wasn't gonna wait another year to order.

SuzAnne S.,"Howell, NJ",195,447,179,4.0,8/20/2012,"I think Chili's is one of the under rated family places around and people think you need to eat whole meals there to enjoy, but in fact this is not the case at all. its great for quick lunches or just a no cook at home dinner night, but you dont want to order in.. Mini-me and I really enjoy Chili's and for under 30.00 for a dinner or 20.00 for lunch/we have plenty to nosh on and believe me it is filling. And I don't mean under $30. For 2- although it easily is, I mean under $30.00 for 3 or 4 people- here is how I do it.....and my discclaimer is that these are some of the option we have worked out for us, so depending on how you order the price will be more or less. What seome people dont see is the fine print- if your orer the chili -queso- YOU Get the chips and sals with it, so you dont need to order it seperate. But sometimes we dont want the queso..  For 2 -3 People We do the 2 for $20. we love the chips and salsa and the fries since both are part of the appetizer combo I order the fries with the deal and chips/salsa on the side. The 2 for $20. portions are perfect size so you are really not over eating, actually we wind up filling up on the chips and salsa so the dinner pretty much goes home for lunch the next day- Might I add, the steamed broccoli at Chili's is probably the best tasting aside from Outback's we have ever had. For lunch we split the buffalo chicken salad, order the chips and salsa and fries. The salad split and is still a hearty portion and they don't skimp on the chicken just because you are splitting it. For 3 people we sometimes just do appetizers I mean order according to your taste and hunger chart 1-10- 10 being starving. I think that for your money you get really great options on the 2 for $20.00 menu. For 3-4 People  If you're like us sometimes you just don't want to cook, but you are not super hungry either and just want to maybe nibble or split stuff which sounds good- go to Chili's order 3-4 appetizers that's perfect. Chips /salsa, Fries, Cheese Queso--YUMMMM! Sure it's not your 7 pyramid food group or anything but add a salad with no dressing and everything on the side, LOL. Once again - pick and choose the variations are pretty good. Right now,  my Chili's is being re-modeled and it has not posed any issue with service or eating there- in fact most of you know my issue with screaming kids at restaurants, when I walk in my super- sonic hearing picks up the sounds of overly tired wee-ones, so when we are being seated it has never ever been a problem to ask to sit away from the exhausted parents in that area, sometimes they need to just get out and enjoy family time, so Chili's in that respect is super kid friendly and I appreciate that. I give 4-Stars only because the parking lot is a bit dangerous and needs to be smoothed out and less speedway friendly. For some reason people drive like maniacs in this particular parking lot and I have not been able to figure out why.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temecula?start=60

Then when I saw my salad, I was very shocked to see the cucumber, its frozen. I never had a salad with frozen cucumber. I asked to speak to the manager, and his very rude, sarcastic and very inconsiderate. He made a comment abt his a burger person & not a salad person. He thinks that its ok to make the customer feel stupid just cause his a manager. I can understand if the cucumber is just cold but frozen and old cucumber & serve it to your customer is not acceptable. As a custoner, I expect that the food supposed to be fresh and new when they serve it the customer I would not recommend this chili's in Ynez.

Sunday, 9-14-20104 we ate the Temecula location on Ynez. We went in around lunch time. Bar was busy with football watchers, the rest was barely 30% full. Greeter said we have a 15 minute wait. Reason? The kitchen just got slammed with orders. I could care less. How about getting us a table ( I see at least 5 empty for our party of 5), taking our drink order, then explaining why we should not order for 10 - 15 minutes. Now that would be good customer service. Instead we were given a vibrating box and told no to stand but sit at the long benches along the hall.

I parked my booty at the bar and was greeted right away by Jimmy. He made a few suggestions while we perused the selections available on tap. A large Stella and Dos XX ran $6 each, not bad.  I decided to share the 2/$20 deal with my my date. We opted for the chips with guac as our appetizer. Our main entrees were the grilled chicken salad, and the 6oz sirloin. The sirloin was surprisingly tasty and needed no extra seasoning or sauce. I ordered my steak medium rare, and it actually came out that way!

Teresa H.,"Temecula, CA",23,52,5,1.0,11/6/2011,"If I never went to a Chili's again, that would be perfect with me. It is beyond me why this place was crowded. Even for generic American fare, this disappointed. My husband got the ribs, which were dry and overcooked, and the grilled shrimp-way too much seasoning and rubbery(again, overcooked). My daughter and I got their ""tacos"", one shrimp, one chicken... They should just call them wraps and forget the ""taco"" angle. Even at that, the seasoning was off by a mile. Service was fine. They need to re-think the menu and retrain the cooks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temecula?start=100
Michael T.,"Temecula, CA",0,11,1,1.0,11/16/2013,"I just came back from them after putting an order online thinking everything had been paid for in advance at the very computer am doing the review on. I order some chicken crispers, a pumpkin spice lava cake, and a strawberry lemonade togo. I had seen the confirm page and a time to pick up my food. So I go all they to the place walk in without my wallet because I figured I was not driving and no point to bring it right. I come being told the online payment was done and that I needed the card to pay with. I told them I didn't have the card because the site gave me in bold letters a confirm and time to pick up my food.  If it did say online payment down it was in small font that I didn't bother to read and that is my fault. What burns me is the fact the had my cell number and didn't call me to confirm if I knew that before I arrive, they burn me again to go call someone to read the card number off for me, but that meant I would have to have my wife how just gave birth to twins and had a c-section to get out of bed to read the card that was in the office. The third and final burn was when they told me go go home to call them and read the card number to them but would not let me take the food with me to do that. So lets recap the last part that I had to go home, call them, read a card number to them, then come back to pick up my food that by that time am sure would of been cold by the time I got home, after make two back and fourth trips to pick up cold food. I wont be buying from this place again because these could of been avoid all together if someone at the place would have bother to take a five second phone to me to tell me the online payment was done and to bring my card.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temecula?start=100

Stephen P.,"Los Angeles, CA",154,1104,2806,3.0,4/21/2010,"Good choice of American food (aka burgers, fried stuff and the occasional healthy dish,) flawless presentation and appetizing prices makes my first visit to chili's (yes, it's true and I'm proud of the fact!) a good one. I ordered the combo for $10 - I chose the Southwestern Eggrolls with a creamy dipping sauce and  Half Rack of Ribs (Memphis Dry Rub) which was a bit dry. The entree came with a choice of side dish - I got the mashed potato. Samantha ordered the Buffalo Chicken Fajitas which is crispy chicken, spicy wing sauce and bleu cheese crumbles served with a plate of beans, crispy lettuce and torillas. That was a lot of food for not a lot of money. I'd come to a Chili's again when I want some reliable comfort food if I'm not worried about my calories. If you're this close to Old Town Temecula why not go there? Well, there aren't many Asians in that picturesque part of town and overhearing a rowdy table of hicks mimicking the Asian catch phrase ""one dollaaar, one dollaaar"" persuaded us leave that joint and we bumped into Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temecula?start=80

Taylar C.,"Temecula, CA",8,4,,1.0,8/29/2014,I work right next to this chili's and every single time I come the food is either cold or just not cooked properly. My #1 complaint about this location is the rude waitresses and that jerk of a manager (black bald guy) . unbelievably rude. Today we were called an asshole by someone who had to take our food back because we asked for medium well steak and received an over cooked well done steak. The black manager came to the table because earlier in the night we ordered guacamole which I happened to almost break my tooth on an avacodo pit told me that they don't take things off the check but can give us a small discount. The only nice one in there was the kitchen manager who was very sweet and friendly. So sad they just lost a customer that comes 2-3 times a week because I work next door. Horrible horrible location. They let me down every time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temecula?start=80
Danielle S.,"Temecula, CA",170,4,,1.0,6/13/2016,"Make sure and double check your account after you eat here folks!!!! My server accidentally charged my card twice when splitting the check with my friend instead of running her card at all. Which was totally fine cuz we noticed and he voided my extra charge off but I checked my bank account while sitting there only to notice an ADDITIONAL charge of 52 dollars to my account!!! Our check was only 35 so it made no sense. Naturally I asked what happened and The server/bartender Joshua informed me that he accidentally charged my card but had fixed it. His story made no sense (I'm pretty convinced he ran my card on another tables check) I asked for some kind of receipt proving they had reversed the charge and was given nothing! not even a sorry by the manager on duty. They informed me that the charge ""should ""be off by Saturday . Welp it's Monday and the charge is still there. I just called back and again not even a sorry was treated like a inconvenience that they took 52 extra dollars from me. He told me it should be fixed in the next few days but we will see! Ridiculous that they think it's ok to treat their customers this way.

Bryant S.,"Murrieta, CA",132,16,17,1.0,10/22/2012,"I gave one star because i was COMPLETELY DISSATISFIED!!!! The food was terrible and tasted like it was made the day before or worse. The service was subpar and the guy ""Jesse"" seemed like we were an inconvenience to him. When we asked if the a/c could be turned up cuz my fiance was cold he said ""it will take a few minutes cuz it's an old system"" but it never shut off. They obviously didnt care about us being comfortable or spending our money there. If it wasn't for my fiance being so nice we wouldnt have paid for anything but the beer i drank. Speaking of, the one ""plus"" was that i enjoyed my 2 beers and the 2nd was delivered pretty quickly.  I understand that nobodies perfect and i am a bit critical when it comes to food and food service, but at the same time it doesnt take too much to satisfy me. Some decent food and semi-attentive service with a smile is all it takes. needless to say i will not be coming back to this chilis EVER again!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temecula?start=80

The gift card had $50.00 printed on the card by the company. When they scanned the gift card it only showed $15.00 on the card but had never been used. So chills pocketed the $50 and only gave $15.00 we paid the rest of the bill out of pocket. What theives! I had to leave a rating but the food was horrible and they questioned are integrity.

I travel a lot, so whenever I see a Chili's too in the airport, I know I can get a great meal at a good price, that is far superior to other airport food.  I also have the added benefit of a familiar menu, that I know what I will get.  I don't know if regular Chili's offer breakfast, but the breakfasts available at the airport are always the best!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temecula?start=120
