Jeff W.,"Troy, TX",3,34,48,5.0,11/8/2017,Well.   Could it be the best freaking Cheeseburger Ever!!  If not the best at least in the conversation of top 3 of all time.  Dyllan my server was on top of it.  Man this dude was the bomb serving up ridicules CheeseBurger that took me to flavor town. After I got to flavor town Dyllan got me a refill of my favorite beverage.  This Dyllan is a legend in the world of Burger serving superstars.   Back to the Burger.   5 Star bad mamba jamba. The fries ain't too shabby.  My wife liked her dish as well and she is a sexy dish herself.    Eat the Bacon Cheese Burger.  If you are lucky you will get Dyllan and you too will end up in flavor town.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temple
Renko R.,"Houston, TX",22,58,124,4.0,11/4/2017,"Ordered a full rack of ribs with fries and corn on the cob on the side. I don't go to Chili's often, but when I do it's usually a ""no idea what else to eat"" type of moment. It never disappoints if you're not looking for anything extravagant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temple
Richard P.,"Weatherford, TX",0,23,16,1.0,12/29/2017,Arriving ahead of reservation still couldn't get seated. Not enough staff to serve or in kitchen. People bailing out after waiting 20+ minutes. Poor management or low pay so individuals won't stay.   I'm done with Chili's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temple
Phillip D.,"Mansfield, TX",90,249,193,4.0,1/10/2017,"Some really cruddy reviews but I was in the mood for a Quesadilla Explosion Salad and to sit at the bar. It's my usual seating arrangement when I am on the road. There are several things that make bar service better than table service almost anywhere. First there is often 2 bartenders tag-teaming so it's easy to get what you want. Second, Bartenders are usually more experienced and bust their hump a bit more. Third, it always seems I am surprised how quickly my food is presented. Maybe they have more pull.  On the off-chance something is wrong you have someone to tell right away-you hold them captive. Not in an inappropriate way, of course. I find the worst meal at Chili's is generally still good. I had no complaints at all. I like locally owned places but sometimes the familiar is just the ticket. I was pleased.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temple

Macy M.,"Temple, TX",65,2,,1.0,12/2/2017,"WE ATE ON NAPKINS FOR MY BIRTHDAY. Worst experience ever!!!!!!!!!! I called ahead to let them know I'd be coming in with a party of 11, I came in for my birthday party & had 5 of my guests eating their dinner on a napkin because our waitress would not come back to bring us plates. We waited for drinks for 30 minutes after being seated, then waited for our food for an hour after that. Then had to eat with a damn napkin. My guests were angry & upset. I ended up going back to the kitchen to find a manager & let her know we have barley been talked too, our waitress never brought us plates after asking 2 different times after having our food served 20 minutes prior. If I could give less than a 1 star, I sure as hell would. DO NOT COME HERE TO EAT, ITS THE AWFUL STAFF!! Thanks for making my birthday so stressful & embarrassing chili's.

Amanda A.,"Llano, TX",60,240,160,4.0,3/22/2016,"We grab to go food on our way to rodeos in McGregor. We've done both a call in method and the mobile app. The food has been typical Chili's (YUM) and hot and fresh.  Keeps us coming back. When you place food to go at Chili's, you deal with the bartenders.  They are always hustlin' as usual.  No problem.  But I usually pick up on some tension between the staff on who is handling what.....   The last 2x's, after inspecting my food (I do this before leaving with all to go orders) I have had no utensils.  If I didn't make a habit of this, I would have a real disappointed family a mile up the road.  Mistakes happen.  I get it.  But they sort of make us ""to go orderers"" feel like an inconvenience.   Not everyone there has had this attitude, but in general.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temple

Sarah P.,"Temple, TX",43,2,,3.0,6/15/2017,"I'll start by saying that the food is normally good and I've never had bad customer service. However, if you order to go, always check your order before you leave the place! They hardly ever get my order correct. Today I got nachos and they forgot the lettuce, sour cream and pico. So I ate dry boring nachos basically. Lesson learned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temple
Sheree H.,"Houston, TX",33,7,,1.0,5/28/2017,"The service is fine the food is not. They seem to do things quite differently at this location than others.

Josh K.,"Temple, TX",0,7,,4.0,2/23/2017,I was reading through the reviews and to be honest I frequent this location because my son likes Chili's. I personally have never had a bad experience. Sometimes the food can be a little hit or miss but i think that's due to who is on the line at the time. Beer is always cold and I am happy that they added some new beers to their selection. Service has always been great. Friendly and attentive servers. I have never left there not feeling satisfied.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temple
Amanda S.,"Killeen, TX",94,14,,1.0,2/2/2017,"Prices have gone up, food quality is just bad, it's like wait staff and managers have just given up.

Kimberly L.,"Webster, TX",318,475,758,2.0,4/11/2015,"Well, damn. We came here to celebrate mine and my niece's running of The Army Marathon's Half Marathon. It wasn't our first choice, as the other places were closed, but Chili's is always good, right? Yeah. Not so much. We called in and got seated right away. The server was nice, and we got menus and drinks quickly. And that's where it all went downhill. We had my 1 year old great-nephew and 3 year old great-niece with us, so we ordered their food first, not realizing our food would take forever to come out. We ordered our appetizers, and those came out quickly, although with no plates. Luckily we're all family and don't mine sharing and a little double dipping. But then we waited. And waited. And waited. This was the slowest restaurant ever. And during that time we barely saw our server. She came by a couple times to refill drinks, but no word of explanation or apology. We actually had to ask about our order, and even after that, we waited. And waited. All the while, the tables around us were waiting too, and the lucky ones that did get food left and the tables stayed dirty. Ew. Finally everything came out, huzzah! But it was all cold, or barely warm. Boo. I don't know if a cook quit in the middle of his/her shift, or what, but  this was really ridiculous. I know it's not a fast food joint, I get that, but still, if I had known that we would be here for so long, I would have brought a book. A really big book. For a celebration dinner, this sure wasn't what we were hoping for. Heck, for any dinner, this wasn't that great. I love me some Chili's but doubt I will be back to this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temple
P P.,"Prosper, TX",4,4,1,1.0,10/7/2016,Possibly the worst service ever.... well I will take that back have no idea even if they have service since no one ever showed up..... 20 minutes and no one even asked have you been helped.... no wonder Brinker is going down hill,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temple
Stefanie L.,"Dallas, TX",2445,953,1686,2.0,12/2/2015,"Fellow reviewers aren't wrong! I took a chance and boy should I have listened. I came in one night to get a to-go order at the bar. I figured it would be quick and painless. I asked for a menu and the bartender gave me attitude like it was SUCH a big deal that I wanted a menu. The dramatic sigh was completely unnecessary. I ordered a drink while I waited hoping to appease her. After she gave me my drink she never came back to take my order. I waited 20 minutes till finally a manager came over and asked me if I needed anything. I explained that I wanted to order a to-go meal. She was so nice. The bartender walked up and the manager told her what I was ordering. Her response was ""oh now she's ordering."" Was I supposed to set off fireworks to flag you down? I asked for a menu and attempted to make eye contact as well as said excuse me twice while you were right in front of me. Yet you ignored me.  My meal turned out ok. I think it sat in the back for a while because when I went to eat it, there were prices of paper stuck to each piece of meat and veggie. They put a paper down on the styrofoam box then placed the food on the paper. It's like the food just grabbed on to it. The food tasted decent but the paper was a bit chewy. Personally I don't like eating paper!  I wouldn't recommend coming here. Service and attitude was horrible, food was just fine. But overall not worth it. I will say, the manager was so sweet and she was the only good thing about the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temple
Kirk A.,"West Lafayette, IN",85,82,176,3.0,5/16/2015,"After previous reviews I was a little doubtful, but...I sat at the bar and the bartender - Christie, did a great job...friendly and prompt even when dealing with a difficult foursome who sat down at the bar when I was there. I had the fajitas,  and they came out hot.  The food was just average,  but we are talking Chili's,  right? The beer was ice cold, and perfect.

Glenn L.,"Argyle, TX",0,44,5,3.0,2/4/2016,"Ordered TOGO beef nachos and southwestern egg rolls. Nachos were burnt and the southwestern egg rolls were under cooked. At $9.50 each was overpriced for what I received. Received no plastic ware for sour cream, salsa, or peppers. While waiting witnessed both very nice and extremely rude staff to customers. Some people have no business working with the public. This place was in walking distance from my hotel. That's about the best thing it had going.

This time it was twinkletoes. First the hostess stared at us like we just decended from the heaven in a spaceship. NOT kidding... she STARED at us! Then our twinkletoes waiter was totally... not in the loop. first off, SPEAK UP! I have no clue what he said nor what his name was nor anything. We ordered a margarita to start, one frozen one on the rocks, simple.. so you might think. Well it took a wile, and we got 2 frozen ones.  Food was good as usual.

Jessica R.,"Little River-Academy, TX",19,6,2,3.0,8/18/2013,"I went to this Chili's with 5 other ladies on a weeknight for dinner. Had our waiter been attentive, polite, or personable, it might have been a decent experience.  Upon ordering chips & salsa as an appetizer, he informed us that we could order them, but he 'guaranteed we would send them back' like other patrons had that day. No explanation! But he said he'd bring us out some on the house & we could order another appetizer. Of course, we all looked at them wondering 'what is wrong with them????'  Some were okay, some greasy, some chewy & stale. The last hour we were there I waited for a refill on my water. Needless to say, I will not be going back. The only reason I did not just give one star is because the balloon guy was exceptionally friendly, & the mango-chili chicken I ordered was moist & delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temple?start=20
Evdokia S.,"Austin, TX",1,124,9,4.0,6/8/2013,"Note to self: When going to Chili's, and you're really hungry, don't order anything less filling than one of their juicy burgers. I learned my lesson a few Fridays ago when we came here for dinner. Was I starving? Check. Did I order a burger? No. Therein lies my problem. I had the delicious steak quesadillas which came with sour cream and pico de gallo. There were about ten small ones, and although we had ordered an appetizer of Chili's great-tasting Southwestern Egg Rolls, that still wasn't enough to fill me up. My husband ordered their Oldtimer with cheese, adding an extra patty to it, and I didn't hear him complain about not being full. *sigh*  Good food.

Jen M.,"Pflugerville, TX",30,40,,1.0,8/29/2014,"Will never return to this Chili's. Never. I'll start from the beginning. A family member had soup a month or so ago at this Chili's location and got very ill shortly after. She had soup. Next trip we ordered take-out, and I ordered the guiltless chicken sandwich. They got the order wrong, and gave me the fattening one (with fries instead of broccoli), but no worries, I can still eat it, right? Wrong-o. The chicken was grossly undercooked. I called the manager after discovering this, and he said he would credit us for the entire meal purchase (a whopping 27 bucks). This credit was never applied to the credit card holder who paid for the meal. As a bonus, we waited a considerable amount of time at the bar waiting to be waited on.   I won't risk getting another meal that could end up making me sick again. Never again will I return to this Chili's location. Not even if they actually paid me to eat there. It is not worth it.

Granted my friends and I have been here 3 times in the last couple weeks but this was the last straw. 1st time they got a free pass because the server was obviously brand new, understandable. 2nd time it was Sunday afternoon and they were jam packed, understandable. But this last time the service was absolutely horrendous. It was our server in particular. She was lazy and took 30-45 min to ever check on us even when we attempted to get her attention she kept walking. Our issue was the poor attitude and eye rolling whenever she did check on us and we needed something. Granted we're polite and well mannered people so it kinda took us by surprise. We could see her playing around in the kitchen from our view and she also took the time to come out and sit at one of the tables to chat with her coworkers, but didn't check on us. We're all adults and have jobs...don't take your frustrations out on the customer. I would mention her name but I don't recall it. I don't plan on going there again.
