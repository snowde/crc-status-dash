Glenn M.,"Edmonton, Canada",0,3,6,5.0,8/28/2017,Fantastic food. Quick and friendly service from Nicholasville.  Delicious watermelon cooler.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-edmonton-3
Sarah W.,"Edmonton, Canada",33,136,213,1.0,7/23/2017,"What a disaster! My husband and myself came here as they have the best cocktails which are perfect on a hot day. We both ordered cocktails which must have taken at least 15 minutes to arrive. Once they arrived the waitress said there's a new girl on the bar. She asked my husband to taste his drink, which he said was completely disgusting and not what he has asked for. The waitress said she didn't think it would taste good as they didn't have some of the ingredients so the new girl decided to make up her own cocktail. My husband then ordered something else. The second drink came down and the waitress poured it, my husband and myself both tasted it and it was the worst drink I've ever tasted. It was pure salt. The waitress came back over and asked how it was to which my husband said it was disgusting, the waitress said she didn't think it would be good as it's not supposed to be pink. She said that she'll get the manager to make the next one. By this time I had finished mine and ordered another. Finally 30 minutes after ordering our first drinks my husband finally got something to drink. We had ordered a starter when we had ordered our first drinks to which there was no sign off. We finished our drinks ordered another round, still no food. 50 minutes we waited for boneless wings, absolutely disgraceful. Once we were finished we asked for the bill and they didn't even discount any of our items. Completely shocked at the level of service from this restaurant, no apology about the whole carry on with the drinks and nothing even mentioned as to why the wings took 50 minutes. Questionable as to whether I'd return here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-edmonton-3
Tamia H.,"Vancouver, Canada",98,444,1881,4.0,5/4/2016,"We came here last week for dinner. It was at a good time because it wasn't even that busy. For some reason though there was a fork and a couple napkins on the floor underneath a nearby table. How did that get there? Refills on fountain drinks are free but the waitress only refilled my drink once. It was only Diet Pepsi. The food was high in sodium but it still tasted good. I really liked the  deep fried pickles that came with the ranch dipping sauce. The loaded boneless chicken wings were very rich and tasty. My Tex Mex Margarita chicken salad bowl was good as well but had too much rice. There was like two cups of rice in there. Overall, we had a good dining experience and nothing bad happened.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-edmonton-3
Krishna T.,"Edmonton, Canada",214,84,85,5.0,2/5/2016,"I quite like this Chili's. They have an awesome atmosphere, unlike most we have been to. The staff are always very friendly and have great recommendations for food.  We have been here a number of times over the past year and a half and it's a great patio place, lounge place, and even sit at the bar and watch the game kind of place.  Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-edmonton-3
Bruce C.,"Edmonton, Canada",156,11,5,1.0,3/2/2016,"A dear fiend took five of us for lunch last Saturday.  I've had lunch here before, but only the soup & sandwich special.  Which was good. Unfortunately, on this day, the service was slow and the food was deplorable.  Well, not all the food, some kind of egg roll served was tasty.  A fajitas order had veggies that were so over cooked, they hung from the fork like spaghetti.  No crunch and even less flavour. My steak was ordered 'medium rare, leaning rare.'  I received a steak that was cooked beyond well done and smelled musty.  It must have been very old.  I chose to not complain about the food as I was being treated to lunch by a freind and didn't want to embarrass her or appear ungrateful. Within an hour of the lunch I had a terrible stomach ache and explosive diarrhea, not a pleasant experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-edmonton-3
Lynsey S.,"Edmonton, Canada",67,94,19,4.0,1/17/2016,"I never say to anybody, ""We need to go eat at Chili's."" It's just not any place that sticks out in my mind as a place that I need to go eat which is a bit strange considering the amount of advertising that they do and how much I love Mexican good. With that being said, I was in Windermere with my boyfriend on a chilly winter's night and we were hungry and not really feeling any of the other options in the neighbourhood so Chili's it was.  We sat down and pursued the bordering-on-giant menu and I was struck by the number of delicious sounding choices that I found. I was considering going with one of the rice bowls until I turned to the last page and saw that they were running a special where 2 people could eat for either $25 or $30 if they chose from the curated selection of items listed there, a choice of an appy and then two main courses. We went with the $30 option: the Mexican spring rolls for our appetizer, the carnitas fajitas for me and the 6 ounce steak with 2 sides for my boyfriend (sides non-negotiable--vegetables and mashed potatoes). Because dinner was so cheap I went with a flight of margaritas to drink and they were all really really good, I do love margaritas and they were all solid choices. The spring rolls were excellent, so flaky and flavourful. I would absolutely recommend them. There was a bit of a wait for our mains but we weren't in a rush and it was totally worth it when they came out of the kitchen. His steak was done absolutely perfectly, bright pink inside, and my fajitas were delicious and the amount of food was huge--I got two full meals out of them plus the two I gave to Josh.  The layout inside was open and warm, lots of booths and everything was bright. It felt a little bit like a sports bar but not in a bad way, trust me. It was inviting and the staff was friendly and accommodating. We had an incredibly filling meal with leftovers AND booze for under $40. Why do I keep thinking I don't like it here? It was great and I will definitely be back the next time I want Mexican and want to stay on my side of town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-edmonton-3
Shannon B.,"Edmonton, Canada",132,31,97,5.0,5/3/2015,Great location and good food. We've been here for hours and still enjoying our time. The staff is still smiling at us even though we paid the bill an hour ago. Daily specials and beer on tap make this a good spot to get the group together.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-edmonton-3
Tanija V.,"Edmonton, Canada",7,1,,2.0,5/22/2016,"Food was ok.....service, however, was terrible.  Not to mention they brought my mother in laws food half an hour before the rest of us.  If you get Thomas as s server, ask for someone different.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-edmonton-3
Dina S.,"Edmonton, Canada",0,2,1,4.0,7/17/2015,Fajita grill and shrimp tacos are more than delicious. Friendly servers. I prefer this location than any other one in Edmonton for they serve food fast.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-edmonton-3
Jennie M.,"Edmonton, Canada",1818,585,2079,3.0,3/29/2013,"Well, normally I am not a fan of Chili's. Too generic, too American. Need I say more? But, this Chili's was not bad. It was spacious with lots of huge flat screens, 2 that were so large that there was actually discussion of if they were 80"" (I think no bigger then 75, but that's another story all together!) The Oil Kings game was playing on all the TVs and considering it was the playoffs I thought that was really cool.  All the servers were dressed in nerd costumes, I have no idea why, but they were all quite fun. Our waiter, though seemed like a land-locked surf bum, was entertaining and prompt. The food was fine; way, way too large but I guess all of the Chili's have to stay uniformed to the portions served south of the boarder. When we ordered our drinks I was asked if I would like to ""Texas Size"" my wine... Uh, I think the only reasonable answer to that is H.E. double hockey sticks ya!  All in all, we had a fun time and it was a comfortable environment. Will I be back? Most definitely, but that is because it is right in the middle of the Cineplex parking lot, hence the reason we went in the first place. There's nowhere else to grab a drink that's within walking distance! Will I go to any other Chili's; not likely.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-edmonton-3
Kris B.,"Edmonton, Canada",66,228,42,3.0,9/6/2013,"It was decent.  Not much more to say. The standard Chili's fare was served with little flare, and an overall apathetic server. The patio was certainly nice in the summer...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-edmonton-3
Roland N.,"Edmonton, Canada",4,17,57,4.0,2/17/2013,"When restaurants first started opening in Windermere, we were expecting a little higher end. We had expected Chili's to be similar to Montana's or Swiss Chalet. Surprisingly it was really good. It was a lot tastier than the Chili's on Calgary Trail.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-edmonton-3
Shannon B.,"Edmonton, Canada",0,5,,1.0,11/25/2014,"I've been to this location a couple times, and have never been happy with the slow service or mediocre food, but since it's right beside he theatre we decided to go back tonight.  I ordered soup, my husband had wings, and the other couple ordered soup as well and a burger and fries. My soup never came, which is strange considering my friend who had the same thing got hers. Our other friend got his chicken burger on a huge plate without fries (which also never came) and the chicken was so dried up he could barely bite through it. By the time the server came back to the table to check on us everyone was finished eating so I told her to forget my meal. We had 2 bills so on ours she took the soup off but never even offered a discount on the bill, which was rather disappointing because husband waited a bit before he ate his food, which was cold by that point. And our friends bill was the same, they didn't pay for the burger because she forgot the other half of that meal but not even a free drink. This was on a Tuesday night with only a few other diners. Unacceptable in my opinion, I understand being slow on a busy night, but our server never even bothered to check on us until the bill was due, and I couldn't get the attention of any other servers in the other side of the restaurant. I will never make the mistake of going back again even if it is conveniently located.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-edmonton-3
Danny N.,"Edmonton, Canada",0,6,,3.0,6/1/2014,"We came for brunch and it was average at best.   We found the food was really greasy.   I'd recommend sticking to the ""normal"" chillis menu.   In terms if decor and atmosphere, this is the nicest Chillis I've been inside.  Big Screen TVs all over the place and a pretty decent bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-edmonton-3
Shanda W.,"Northwest Edmonton, Canada",1,12,2,1.0,11/4/2013,"This is a prime example of why I hate chain restaurants. The place itself is new and very nice decor the service on the other hand needs a lot of work. The waitress we had was working the small section were we were seated and she must have had like three other people helping her. She was rude and so slow we waited for ages for our drinks and when we needed them refilled I had to call over the host to get us refills. The ""what I assume"" was the manager came to our table and I asked her for a refill she disappeared and that was the last we seen of her. My husband ordered a steak rare and when it was delivered to our table is was medium well. I told him to send it back but we didn't want to wait any longer. Just so sad when places like this could do so well and lazy staff ruin it for the owners. We gave the waitress a $4 tip but she didn't deserve a penny!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-edmonton-3
Matt S.,"Edmonton, Canada",366,45,101,2.0,10/21/2013,"I'd like to give a review about service, however we waited to be seated and no one cared to do so... Oh well off to some place that wants our money!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-edmonton-3
Michael S.,"Edmonton, Canada",0,9,3,2.0,6/15/2013,Really slooooooooooooooow service. 15 minute wait before we were able to flag someone down to take our order. Several tables served before us.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-edmonton-3
Alan A.,"Edmonton, Canada",0,5,,2.0,6/1/2013,"First off I've been to this location about a dozen times in the past. Last night will be my last time. My girlfriend is celiac she cannot eat gluten this is why we have come to Chillis. They have a decent GF menu and even have GF beer. The service is usually really good. Last night we tired ordering appys off the GF menu and 5 minutes later where told they took that off the menu so we couldnt have it. The waitress requested somethig else that wasn't gluten free and explained she didn't really know much about the allergy. When our meals came it wasn't what my girlfriend had ordered, because again the kitchen said what was on the menu was wrong, so they just brought her something else as a side without even asking what she wanted. When the manager came over we expressed our concern and he apologized and offered French fries so she wouldn't go home hungry. Again not GF fries. My girlfriend would be in the hospital if she ate the wrong thing. Your restraunt cannot be trusted. We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-edmonton-3
