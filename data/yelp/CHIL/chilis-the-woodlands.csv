Stephanie V.,"The Woodlands, TX",370,80,385,3.0,10/4/2017,"Service is always pretty good. I don't know why the food doesn't WOW me. Today I came for lunch and for the chicken enchilada soup for starters and chicken bacon ranch quesadilla for lunch = $7 The soup was heavy, not my taste but that's okay! And for folks with chips & quesadilla really fast. I would recommend coming here for bang for you buck! $4 house wines and my husband got the half pound burger with fries for $7. He said it was better than Fuddruckers. For the value you get here, yes!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands
Kelly H.,"Spring, TX",47,27,5,5.0,2/25/2017,Got my vote  Bring back those ashtrays and smoke um up I love this place  Service great food great Beer cold and my ashtray was clean I will return,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands
Kelsey W.,"Conroe, TX",4,7,,5.0,9/26/2017,I come here all the time. The food is amazing and I love the point their are so many healthy options available. The staff is great here. We were seated promptly and the staff are always so nice and cater to our every need. I defiantly recommend this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands
Tami B.,"Humble, TX",0,9,,1.0,11/17/2017,"Well... all good things come to end. Had issues with this Chilis some time back. After a lengthy boycott we tried it again and were very happy.  Darrin is an OUTSTANDING server and Trace a great GM... Today, Trace is gone, Darrin was off, and it went downhill FAST!!  After being escorted to the furthest table possible, we waited 18 minutes to get drinks... after feeling abandoned I went in search of someone... anyone... wasn't picky at this point. No luck... my friend CALLED... left on hold then disconnected. She called again... asked for thr manager - who was shocked that someone was calling from INSIDE the restaurant. At long last a server...NOT OURS but a server none the less appeared. Sensing our unhappiness, went to get the manager. She came... not impressed. She's now gone to the kitchen to oversee our order... who knows. Thinking it's time for another boycott!!  We miss you Trace and Darrin... :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands
Michael S.,"Spring, TX",0,6,,1.0,4/19/2017,"We are a family of 4. We really like the location. We really like the food. We really like the service...However, let's address the elephant in the room. SMOKING. It is sickening and ruins the experience and taste. Because of SMOKING and only this reason, We will not return until the restaurant is smoke free! it's 2017 people! The smoking needs to stop. Disgusting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands
Lynn T.,"Spring, TX",0,19,,1.0,11/30/2016,This rating is generous - terrible overall. I walked in and along with a few other people waiting to be seated we all left. The wait staff and bartender even saw us with the few customers they had and totally ignored us all! We all left together which was empowering. I hope the chain closes.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands
Amy E.,"Spring, TX",119,4,,5.0,8/21/2017,This Chilis is by far the best one I have visited in The Woodlands area! The staff and managers are very friendly here. Smoking is no longer allowed and the place smells and looks great! Food came out to the table hot and fast! We love this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands
Gwen B.,"Spring, TX",0,34,10,5.0,7/4/2016,"I think management has changed since I ate here a while ago.  This time, service was excellent and food came out fast and hot. Love it!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands
Cortney O.,"Spring, TX",116,3,,1.0,10/22/2017,"I don't recommend this place. Normally I've never had nothing really negative to say about this location but tonight I do. When we first got there we had to wait 5 minutes for anyone to seat/acknowledged us.(party of 2) once the manager finally came to seat us we asked for a table close the to bar area so we could see the tv as the Astros were playing. She tried to seat us at a dirty table... we settled to sit on the other side of the room since that table was clean (but water still on the table). Took another 5 minutes to get our drink order. By the way there were only 3 other tables this whole time. We got our drinks and ordered an appetizer, when it finally came to the table it was wrong. Food was average, nothing great. Our table was checked on twice our whole time. I had an empty drink, not once did I ask if I wanted a refill. And she didn't ever come back to check on us or anything. Luckily they have the kiosk so we didn't have to wait another 20 minutes to pay. Don't waste your money here. Go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands
Marshall M.,"The Woodlands, TX",0,31,,2.0,3/1/2017,The food was sub-par.  It's really hard to screw up a few burgers but somehow the burgers were just about burned after I asked for medium rare and medium.  I'd rather eat fast food to skip the tip.  Chili's used to have really good food many years ago.  Maybe I'm just older and have higher expectations as an adult?  I won't eat at another Chili's unless I'm forced to.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands
Rose W.,"Tomball, TX",0,4,,4.0,5/24/2017,"Finally they have gone non-smoking. As the only open-late restaurant in the area, the smoking was a deal breaker - thank you so much for changing to non-smoking!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands
Susan R.,"The Woodlands, TX",38,14,5,1.0,5/30/2016,Awful. Didn't stay to eat. Walked in and you are hit with smoke from the bar. But when you go to restaurant side it doesn't smell as bad. Hostess was completely disinterested and very unfriendly seating us at a table that had visible wet seats and still the seats were dirty with corn chips. So we figured if they were that disinterested in making a decent impression we didn't want to test  the food. Went to Skeeter's Grill in Cochran's Crossing. SO much better!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands
Aleisha K.,"Spring, TX",0,4,,1.0,4/21/2017,Poor service- food was ok... my food came out in different pieces and another meal was incorrect. We were there at a very NONE BUSY time and still was a poor experience... won't come here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands
Roselynn Z.,"The Woodlands, TX",1,23,3,1.0,9/15/2016,Nasty place! I had a nail in my salad! I am thankful I didn't break a tooth. The management gave me  gift card for a free meal which I appreciate. At the same time I don't have it in me to go back. The nail in my mouth has ruined it for me.  On top of the the service was subpar and bathrooms were dirty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands
Andy B.,"Tomball, TX",0,29,,1.0,5/5/2015,We have dinner at this place several times a month.  Reasonable priced with mostly God food for the money. This one time I ordered take-out fajitas.  Picked up the order and took it home.  The beef was refrigerator cold.  Obviously it was previously cooked but hardly visited the grill on the re-heat. Next time I stopped at the restaurant I called for the manager.  I told him what they did wrong; I got a blank stare and hardly any more! I am not tipping that crowd until I know that I got the service I expect. That means that I will not tip for take-out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands
Eric I.,"Conroe, TX",7,99,77,2.0,3/15/2016,"This is a ""sad"" Chili's, stuck in some by gone era that should stay there.  I want to like this place, mainly because it's my neighborhood Chili's.  But first off, continuing to allow smoking inside is about as 1960's greasy spoon diner as you can get.  Second, it's always slow and there is never anyone there.  Now, happily, the food I've got there has always seemed to be pretty good, although the last set of ribs I purchased was the worst and most depressing set of ribs I've ever had.  For being so close to our house, rest assured, we ""should"" be eating there more often, but given it's quality, that won't be happening.  It would be awesome to see something else take it's place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands
Bruce H.,"Spring, TX",0,4,,1.0,8/12/2016,"Full of smoke.  Who allows smoking these days?  Also, they unhooked my favorite beer so they could hook up an old keg of skanky beer and get rid of it",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands
Cassie H.,"Spring, TX",0,4,,1.0,12/4/2016,"Terrible. Waited too long to be seated. Waitress didn't bring water till food was ready. Then asked for a Togo box and never got it... great food, terrible service. 1488 location is just as bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands
Matt L.,"Spring, TX",0,13,,1.0,3/5/2016,"Food was served cold.  Asked them to warm up my bowl of chili, and the second bowl was cold. Not sure what they didn't understand about ""please warm this up."" Won't return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands
Dean F.,"Tomball, TX",32,47,1,2.0,11/23/2015,Good food and service but the cigarette smoke ruins the meal.  As always they do good burgers and enchiladas.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands
Brandon T.,"Spring, TX",0,6,,1.0,10/27/2016,Stopped in for lunch and the service left a lot to be desired. Maybe saw the waitress twice. Everyone was busy with tasks other than serving.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands?start=20
Greg T.,"The Woodlands, TX",16,159,,2.0,7/25/2014,"We popped in last week for lunch.  We applaud the new menu and think some of the additions are a step in the right direction. The place was also clean except the bar seating area. The big and I mean BIG downside is; this has got to be one of those ""slow learners"" in The Woodlands.  No decent, respectable restaurant still allows for smoking in the restaurant.  Nothing against smokers....we just like a clean - air and facilities - place to dine.  So, we think we'll pass on this place until they catch-on to what 99% of other restaurants in the area already know. More business with happier, repeat customers if you provide them with good food, good service, in a clean appealing environment. My 2 cents Greg T.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands?start=20
K P.,"Spring, TX",0,3,,1.0,5/15/2016,"After reading some reviews it seems the main complain is slow service which is absolutely true. They sat my party and I all the way in the back by the restroom and this is no problem except everyone else was seated towards the front of the restaurant where they received great service nonetheless! Whereas my party and I were neglected and were kept waiting well over 15 minutes just to order. I would've understood if it was busy, but it wasn't. Service is horrible!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands?start=20
Ryan E.,"The Woodlands, TX",0,15,2,1.0,3/18/2016,"Worst Chili's in the area, DO NOT GO HERE!! The place was not busy at 9pm and it took 20 mins to get our order taken, 20+ minutes to relieve our drinks, our orders came out wrong, and our server only checked on us once the whole visit. We complained to the on duty manager and she did absolutely nothing claiming they were busy and under staffed with only 3 tables in the whole place. I called the GM and never heard back...I am furious and have emailed 6000 of my email contacts in the woodlands to never visit the list location again. And just like ricos in alden bridge, once I emailed my contacts, the place went out of business....this place will learn their lesson.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands?start=20
Tracey P.,"The Woodlands, TX",0,5,,1.0,3/3/2016,"Every time I visit this location (3 times a year) I promise myself it will be the last time.  My most recent visit is certainly it.  Service is consistently slow; friendly enough, but slow.   Maybe I'm supposed to get refills using the electronic device on the table?  Who knows?  That whole thing is confusing.  At any rate, I'm just glad I had a gift card for this visit so I didn't actually have to pay for anything.  Also, based on the feedback I gave on the in-restaurant survey, my guess would be the results are seen immediately by the server.  Chelsey must not have been pleased I did not give her high marks, although she instructed me to do so (yes that really happened).  It's important to note that she acted annoyed in spite of 15% tip which is much less that my normal and more than she earned.  Luckily there are more choices in the area now that are open as late as Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands?start=20
Travis B.,"Lawton, OK",13,8,4,4.0,5/24/2014,The people are quite friendly and the place is pleasantly clean. I enjoyed many conversations with the staff here and I think they are worth the trip up here. Food is well prepared and made to my specifications. Which is what you need from a restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands?start=20
D C.,"Magnolia, TX",2,11,2,5.0,4/23/2015,This place is clean with awesome service at the bar!!! Please try the smoked wings!!! Unbelievably good!!! All bartenders are high level with customer service....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands?start=20
Melissa J.,"Spring, TX",0,3,2,1.0,2/2/2016,Disgusting! Took me a while to recover from smoke smell after canceling our order and leaving. I will never return to a Chili's until it is smoke free! The menu looked interesting and I wanted to try the happy hour special margarita but was ready to vomit.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands?start=20
Rick B.,"Spring, TX",0,1,,2.0,4/10/2016,"Why does it take SO LONG to place an order?... And  why do they ""bunch everybody up"" sitting on top of each other?  We eat out to the tune of $1000 a month... i need to find another restaurant!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands?start=20
David S.,"Spring, TX",37,33,6,4.0,3/25/2013,"Tried this place out for the second time, as I like to give restaurants a second chance. I don't remember the exact names of the dishes my friend and I ordered, but I got a big plate of field greens and romaine lettuce, with grilled chicken and a spicy sauce, it was good I had a Tilapia with a mango sauce, which I enjoyed.  Food took a little long, maybe like 15 minutes, more than I'm used to waiting for food at a fast food chain, and it wasn't even that busy.  What was remarkable was the service, very attentive, drinks refilled, constant asking how things were, if we needed anything. We truly appreciated a great service, and courteous staff.  We shared the molten chocolate cake, with caramel sauce, and a scoop of vanilla icecream that was encloced inside a chocolate shell. The cake was warm, and the difference in temperature of cold and hot was wonderful. I throughouly enjoyed this dessert.  The music that was played was great as well, a very laid back type of music, at the perfect volume, not too loud not too soft.  My only complaint this time, would again be about the smoking aspect of the restaurant. As soon as you walk in, you are overwhelmed by the smell of cigarette smoke from the bar area to your right. Very disgusting. But once you walk towards the main dining room, you can't smell it anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands?start=20
Karen V.,"Spring, TX",7,9,15,5.0,6/9/2012,"This is the cheers of The Woodlands. Everyone knows us here and our favorite foods. They even know just how we like our foods prepared. Amazing friendly and very courteous staff. With managers like Trac the leader of the pack and his posse of sidekicks Grant, Sasha, and Josh make your time here the best that it can be.. That's why my family makes this Chili's our home away from home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands?start=20

Cory S.,"Indianapolis, IN",89,501,18,2.0,7/7/2011,"The other reviews are dead on here... Service is blah (she was a Yankee's fan, so we all know what to expect!! :)) Food was lack-luster and establishment shows it age pretty easily.  The bartender (I sat in the bar), was 'yelling' at other workers... Telling them to get the door, grab her this, do that... Not a great experience.  They did have Bud Light Wheat, but the rest of the experience was nothing special.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands?start=20
Robert T.,"Spring, TX",0,6,,2.0,12/24/2013,"Ordered takeout via online app. Drove all the way to the restaurant then    10 minutes after the order was supposed to be ready I was told they were out of salmon, which was the only thing I really wanted.  Then they tried to charge me For salmon instead of the burger that was substituted for the the salmon.    Morale: don't order take out from here on a busy restaurant night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands?start=20
Bob M.,"Spring, TX",350,59,2,5.0,12/22/2014,The team at this chili's is world's class. Friendly and very attentive. The food was prepared perfectly and service was great. The new Southern Burger is good. Definitely recommend.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands?start=20
Dominic Z.,"Conroe, TX",118,63,3,4.0,10/13/2013,Close to home and you get good service at the bar. They still allow smoking and I am not a fan of that. But for a chain it isnt bad for a comfort meal out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands?start=20
Lauren P.,"New Waverly, TX",154,239,16,2.0,1/19/2009,"My food came out before my son's and all he wanted was the mac n cheese and corn on the cob. When the child's food did arrive I had to beg the waiter 4 times for a spoon for the boy. The first bite burned my child to the point of him screaming, crying and then basically becoming afraid of his food. I was finished eating by the time the mac n cheese was cool enough for my child to eat and by then he was cranky and wanted to go home, so we boxed up his entire meal. Clue in people - if you have a kids menu realise they do not want *HOT* food! They want room temperature food. If you cannot do that than remove your kids menu. I understand there are health/saftey regulations but then make the kids' food first and have it cooling while the adults' meal{s} are prepared. I have not and will not return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands?start=20
bosco w.,"Houston, TX",0,4,,1.0,12/15/2012,"This location is by far the worst chili's i have ever been to. I ordered the steak quesadillas. After my first bite, I noticed there was not much taste beside flour tortilla. I opened it up and barely saw cheese and a a microscopic piece of meat. Upon examining the rest of them, I was very disappointed.  Hardly any meat or cheese on any of them.  Do yourself a favor and drive a little further to the magnolia location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands?start=20

Lee P.,"Spring, TX",1,15,,1.0,2/8/2012,"My wife was working late one night last week so my daughter and I went to this Chilis for dinner because it is close to our house. No host or hostess at the front and we waited literally over 5 minutes for someone else to finally stop and ask if they could help. We were seated and at the time 6 tables were occupied at the time. 2 waitresses were on duty. Over 8 minutes elapsed before the waitress handling the far section stopped by and took our orders. Overall, our waitress actually waited on us once. The same person did not visit our table twice. The restaurant smelled musty, food was greasy and slow to arrive and service deplorable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands?start=40
