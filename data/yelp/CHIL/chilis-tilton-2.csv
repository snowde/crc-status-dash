Sam J.,"Franconia, NH",0,4,8,5.0,12/27/2017,"The food was very good. The service was amazing and everyone was very nice.  I am a very picky eater so when I looked at the menu the thing I wanted had a few things in it that I did not like, so the people removed it and gave me a delicious meal. Me and my family will defiantly be going back because we left being very happy and just the right amount of full to hold us for the rest of the night. So good job Chile!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tilton-2
Robert G.,"Denver, CO",2,14,,2.0,8/5/2017,"Standard food fare, but this place was grimy! Ewww. Everything was sticky...menus, seats, tables...yuck. Avoid this one until it's sanitized.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tilton-2
Amber L.,"North Billerica, MA",2,19,9,1.0,10/21/2017,"It's a constant disappointment with this place - I love Chilis and it's the closest location to me but this location is the worst I've ever been too. The Texas cheese fries are always burnt and overlooked. My roommates chicken tenders came out raw. You order ""extra"" ranch or sour cream to go and you get neither. I came the other day and had to wait 10 minutes to get someone's attention to get my takeout order. The bartender mumbled to one of his customers saying ""takeout isn't my problem"" after a waitress already went over and brought him my bag - he just had to cash me out and he wasn't busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tilton-2
Karen P.,"Methuen, MA",0,6,,4.0,12/9/2017,This night was cray cray who said I said it what girl that's right girl any ways I went to this Chili's place because Wendy's ran out so I go in and they just automatically say Welcome to chilis so then i say yeah shut up and get me some milk so they say ok and lead me to a table and say I'll be right out with your milk make that vegan dairy and gluten free no grass and no artificial color chocolate milk because when I go home to night and do my usual burp in my dogs face before I head to sleepe sorry excuse my Spanish I don't want my pet peeve to die I would rather you die sir then she replied with I'm a girl like how was I supposed to know my bad she looks like a guy so she comes back with regular milk to I take one gulp and get and burp in her face and SAY I HATE MILK YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS TAKE IT BACK. but you ordered milk she says I ORDERED CHOCOLATE MILK. so she say you just drank like half of it tho and I say take it back and when you come back bring me your finest chili. So she comes back like 20 minutes later with my food And no milk so I give up I take a bite of my chili and say HEY BILLY GET BACK HERE NOW THIS IS WAY TO HOT. so I spit it in her eyeballs and leave and say one last thing OH AND BILL SEND MY THE CHECK IN THE MAIL YOUR WELCOME. But I went home that day and honestly the best meal of my life even though the waitress was a jerk and I never got my check so there 4 star recommendation completely,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tilton-2
Erica B.,"Concord, NH",19,7,,2.0,6/25/2017,"Our drinks were awesome! My chicken quesadilla was barely warm,  and the chicken was chewy. The waitress was slow, took so long to get change we made correct change and left! My advice... eat somewhere else and go here for drinks!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tilton-2
Maura T.,"Milford, MA",21,31,9,5.0,5/7/2017,"We come here at least once a month, and we've enjoyed it every time! We usually try to sit in Ian's section at the bar- he's great at his job, welcoming, and always makes us want to return. We will definitely be back soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tilton-2
Jason S.,"Ashland, NH",35,3,1,1.0,4/7/2017,The worst!! Had the 2 for 22 so called deal the pickles where so salty. The burger ordered med well was raw. Took forever just to get drinks and that was sitting in the bar at a booth. After meal came I waited over ten minutes to try and return burger by this time all I wanted to do was leave. The other meal ordered was there 1 pasta dish and I'm sure it came out of microwave it was gross. Great for drinks and bar food that's about it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tilton-2
F G.,"Concord, NH",3,69,15,1.0,12/4/2015,"In the past I have stayed away from because my bad experience with their food. I don't know why I went back one day expecting a different result. I feel that their food is all partially cooked at some headquarters and they basically reheat it and then drizzle some fat based sauce on it.  Additionally, I keep reading on Yahoo how horrible their food is for you (fat and sodium).  I know I can't take what I read online to heart all the time, but I know that their meals contain way much more fat and salt then most of the other placed I dine Anyhow, I stopped in for a meal today because I was really in the mood for fajitas. So I ordered the steak and shrimp. The menu shows large grilled shrimp and slices of red steak.   What I received was the ""Taco Bell dollar menu"" version. The shrimp were few and very small. They were overlooked to the point they tasted like rubber. The nice steak slices some how turned into this salty pulled beef type of something that looks like  In addition to the awful meat and shrimp, I had to deal with young servers who made it very apparent they did not want to be there.  When my food arrived I sat there and waited for silverware while my server was playing on her phone at the other end of the bar.  I didn't want to yell across the bar, so I waited.   The bar wasn't too busy that night but I felt like I was being a burden to get another beer, get my check, and whatever else diners require from servers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tilton-2
Eli R.,"Concord, NH",1,28,6,1.0,2/19/2016,Went on lunch break which was a terrible idea. Took 45 mins to get a medium rare steak (that ended up being well done). Then no compensation for the time or terrible food. Never again at this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tilton-2
Yarid M.,"Chelsea, MA",1,3,1,5.0,8/15/2015,Awesome service!! This was my first time ever trying Chili's and I will definitely return. This location had a very awesome group of workers that were patient and cared for what we wanted!!! Overall awesome experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tilton-2
Bonnie N.,"Bristol, NH",0,13,1,2.0,8/4/2015,"Service good, food blah at best. Salad drowning,limp, grilled chicken anemic, cold. Big bite burger greasy, roll is too sweet. Good thing drinks and Moulton cake pull it off!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tilton-2
Adam S.,"Vernon, CT",0,11,,4.0,3/20/2016,"It's been hit or miss for me at this Chillis. Last time I was there, I was very pleased with our server. The food for once was exactly what I was looking for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tilton-2
Sandy G.,"Hawthorne, NJ",0,5,2,1.0,12/13/2015,Very long wait for drink order. Even longer wait for our food.  Salads were horrible. Chicken was like rubber and the salad was drenched in dressing.  McDonald's would have been better.  Don't go unless you have lots of time to wait and wait,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tilton-2
Calvin F.,"Concord, NH",14,34,18,4.0,5/13/2014,"As much as I prefer to frequent local places instead of chains...I just can't possibly knock this place.  The service is always great for drinks as well as food.  The team is very professional and they work hard.  I really like the steak here.  Always cooked perfectly to order and the price is nice.  I'm also a big fan of the loaded mashed potatoes here.   There are almost all the major chains right on this route three strip through Tilton, but this is the one I frequent most often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tilton-2
Shannon L.,"Nashua, NH",19,39,,1.0,11/28/2015,"Stopped in for a bite and a drink at the bar on Friday night.. Shopped at the outlets all day and staying in the area over night figured I'd give it a try since I like Chilis.  Waited at the bar to be noticed a few minutes, no big deal since they were stocking up on ice and stuff.. Decided to try the drink menu instead of the old stand by beer.  Tried a titos punch, it was so bad.. The bartender a heavier set girl than her co-worker didn't seem to care about the customers at all, watching her frown and make sarcastic faces at the regular patrons.. I thought about asking them to remake the drink or trying something else but the girl sitting next to me that ordered the Presidente margarita said the same thing.. One and done.. Plenty of other places in the area to relax and get good service and a decent drink and bite to eat..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tilton-2
Annie N.,"Medford, MA",4,27,9,1.0,2/19/2014,"Honestly, the worst ribs i've ever had, or whatever the heck they were! The waitstaff were indifferent to my concerns. I went with a group of close, intimate friends to celebrate one of my cherished friend's birthday. She has a food allergy, and Chili's barely had any options for her! When our orders finally came out (after an extensive wait time!) my order was wrong. I then had to watch my friends wait politely while their food became colder and colder while i awaited for my own order. When it finally arrived, i couldn't help but be disappointed in the low quality of the cuisine. Definitely never going back!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tilton-2
Sarah S.,"Plymouth, NH",10,47,136,5.0,10/27/2012,Uh absolutely delicious. Just had dinner fir two consisting of fajita dinner and 6oz sirloin and appetizer and played pranks on friends we saw there for under $25. The wait staff is great especially our waiter James. It was a most excellent time!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tilton-2
Sue S.,"Concord, NH",0,8,,3.0,1/10/2014,"The food here is pretty good, standard pub fare. The thing that really annoyed me was when we were seated, the waitress came over to take our drink order, then asks if we would like chips & salsa. Sure, we would like chips & salsa. Then when the bill comes, we are charged $3.99 for the chips & salsa! If you're going to charge for them, don't pretend like they're complimentary when you're asking if we would like them. The chips seem to be freshly made, but were very very thin and so salty I could barely eat them, and they actually sat half eaten in their bowl. Everything else was fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tilton-2
