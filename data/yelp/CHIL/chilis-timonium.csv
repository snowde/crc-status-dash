Lorraine D.,"Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, NY",42,15,18,5.0,1/31/2016,Super friendly staff and you never have to wait for a table because the place is so large. Food is fresh and plentiful and hot when it arrives. Desserts are big and REALLY great. It would be nice if they would bring back the fried ice cream pretty please! Also the sound quality is fine even when it is crowded. Very easy place to come back too!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-timonium?start=20

Scott B.,"Lutherville-Timonium, MD",0,8,2,1.0,2/5/2016,"We sat at the bar and ordered boneless buffalo wings that were not crisp but almost soggy. We ate less than half of the order.  We also ordered  the quesadilla salad. The chicken on the salad was moist and good. However, the salad was drowning in dressing. I guess I should have ordered it on the side. I ate about a third of it.  The server cleared the plates without asking how we enjoyed the meal. It wasn't until she was about to give us the check did she ask. We told her the issues and that it was no big deal. She didn't offer to reduce the bill  and said it would be a hassle to get the manager but said next time we go to tell her that we had an issue and she would take care of it.  With so many options in the area there won't be a next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-timonium?start=20

C P.,"Parkville, MD",0,18,7,4.0,7/1/2015,"Okay, staff are nice.   Food is good but your average easy going type of place.   Wish the menu was a little more varied.   Seems like lots of Mexican food and a few burgers.   I love Mexican, but I'd like to have a few more options.   We ordered fried pickles, they were a bit on the greasy side and kinda had a fishy taste to them...you can tell they must have been fried in the same oil that something fishy was.  Im funny with that I can tell when my fries are like that so it may be just me.   I'd go back, but maybe try the fajitas instead of the burger, which the roll was much to Bready for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-timonium?start=20
Pat M.,"Baltimore, MD",90,288,13,2.0,12/25/2013,"Ohhhhh, Chili's, what have you done to your steak fajitas?! Went here with work mates the other day, as a sort of impromptu holiday luncheon. It was the second time I'd been there since our offices moved up Cockeysville way, and I typically opt for a local place for a better lunch, or the local Subway for a more pedestrian lunch. The first visit doesn't even stick out in my mind, and I presume the food didn't impress me enough that I chose to make the time and effort to post a review (I'll often give a place a second chance, which is why I don't have all that many one and two star reviews). This time around the food took a long time to arrive, and one of our party was given the wrong beverage. And my fajitas were so very, very disappointing. Don't know what Chili's has done as far as recipe changes, but the new fajitas - and mine were overcooked - tasted very heavily of black pepper. YUCK! Don't think I'll be returning, especially with so many other nearby options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-timonium?start=20

Giovanno B.,"Baltimore, MD",2,35,,4.0,8/5/2014,"The enchilada dishes are great and plenty on the plate, my usual go-to item if at a tex-mex spot. Some eateries serve two..which leaves me hungry; Chili's puts out three which is right.  If you bring children, avoid the bar half.

Tim H.,"Silver Spring, MD",151,419,187,3.0,6/9/2011,I like the 2 for 20 menu items. I also like the all u can eat soup and salad combo. Go here every now and then with coworkers. It gets crowded during the hours of 12-1 due to the lunch rush. If you can wait until after 1 it is best. There are not a whole lot of places to eat in the area and because of the office buildings around this place can get busy early during the work week. A nice bacon burger medium please!

Eric J.,"Cottonwood, AZ",20,31,,4.0,8/31/2014,"I had to write this.  We met up with about 20 members of our family visiting from out of town and went to Chili's unexpectedly for dinner.  We were pleasantly surprised by every aspect of our time there -- the food, the service - the whole package.   Our waitress was amazing - attentive, forgiving of our constant need for straws, refills on our drinks, and the need for a fair amount of time between appetizers and the meal. I ordered the vegetarian burger and was surprised by the good taste of the actual bean burger, as well as the great presentation.  I'd just like to say, Go Chili's.  Thanks for helping to make this dining experience with my extended family wonderful in every way.  We all liked our meal very much and particularly the excellent service we received.   Good service, good food and great prices!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-timonium?start=20

Jim H.,"Baltimore, MD",9,144,1,2.0,2/21/2012,"If your food of choice involves chicken, this place is for you, because 90% of the dishes here are chicken-based.  After all ""chicken is so versatile"".  I'm no huge fan of chicken, with all its dirty warehouse processing and their poor living conditions...but all PETA aside, this place is overrated.   I decided on nachos and was ready to order when the waitress came.  She asked me if I wanted the ""9 or the 12"".  So I just had to ask ""The nine or the twelve what? I want nachos!"" So she explained to me that the nachos there were counted out and each chip had toppings on it.  So I just had to mess with her.  I told her I wanted the 13. Stupid me, I didn't realize our country had such a corn chip shortage (smack HEAD!)....Well I certainly wanted to do my part to chip in (pun intended); wouldn't want the less fortunate not to have their chip rations for the week. Imagine the chaos of a chip rebellion in this country--poor, ragged indigent people with salsa jars in their hands with nothing to dip in it.  The horror!  Deciding that was too much stupidity for me, I changed my order. I got a cheeseburger. Not sure what it was called-something to do with an avocado, b'cus there was a slice of avocado on it-duh! Not bad, but nothing great for the price.   Also a pet peeve of mine is when restaurants pre-salt their fries.  WTF is with that?  Can't they trust me to season my own damn fries? My girlfriend had the chili and was repulsed.  I tasted it and it and found that it to be a thin gruel seasoned with chili.  You'd think a place called Chili's could do a decent chili!  The feck?!  Garbage!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-timonium?start=20

Decent fajitas and good salads, with tasty sauces for ribs that aren't themselves as good as you could get down the road at a barbecue place.

Gwen M.,"Pikesville, MD",36,99,3,4.0,11/17/2014,"Have been to this location a few times. Each time I have been satisfied with the service and food. This time we were introduced to their table top computer which allows you to pay right at the table if using a card. It was quick and easy. Even could leave a tip and use a coupon with the computer service. I think if you pay with cash you still have to go through the waitress, but this seems more secure than giving your card for them to take someplace else as well as using an email coupon that was on my phone- I would not want to give my phone to anybody to take elsewhere.

Helen H.,"San Jose, CA",10,232,194,3.0,8/1/2017,"This is a convenient restaurant connected to a hotel. The food is okay. There is a decent amount of options available, from burgers to ribs. The chicken and prime rib enchiladas came with a good amount of meat and was filling. The sour cream, salsa, pick de gallo, lime, cheese, and guacamole have some life to the meal. The buffalo wings were pretty crispy and tasted pretty good. The celery that came with it looked kind of old. The shrimp tacos were not too good and were kind of plain. The mango chicken plate was okay. The chicken was soft and the mangos gave it a nice tropical punch. The salad is overly drenched in dressing and was not fresh.  Customer service really depends on who the waiter is. I find that the male waiters were much better to deal with. I was ignored by the hostess when she accommodated a pair of men that arrived after me. Ordering to go at the bar area during lunch was the worse experience ever. I ended up being ignored by the waitress for over 10 minutes even though she passed by me at least five times. I ended ordering over the phone while sitting in the bar area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-timonium

Cynthia F.,"Lutherville-Timonium, MD",127,194,483,4.0,10/3/2016,"Ok, so I came to Chili's last night and ordered a steak. I don't really have super high standards for chain restaurant steaks but this steak was perfect! I was very pleasantly surprised. I got the 10oz medium rare and it was cooked perfectly and so tender, not chewy at all. The skillet mashed potatoes were also very good! I will say that service was very slow during my visit last night, that was the only disappointing part.

Shanay B.,"Owings Mills, MD",97,148,25,4.0,1/8/2017,After dining at the Chilis in White Marsh about a month ago I honestly did not want to return.  I spoke to my amazing parents about the restaurant they mentioned going to the Timonium location where we did enjoy our time.  I had the 3 for 10.00 special and my parents had create your own fajitas.  The only problem we encountered which was small was the waitress gave me salad instead of chips and salsa.

Molly B.,"Baltimore, MD",15,48,47,2.0,3/24/2017,"Visited this location three times. I didn't want to write a review until I gave it a fair shot.  This location is somewhat obscured. It's right off of i83, but not on the main road (York Rd).  It's a stand alone Restauarant next to a hotel.  The area is somewhat industrial. There are a lot of trucks, the light rail, etc.  Ordering to-go was easy and simple. Is your best option, but, check your order before you leave.  I visited one evening, around 9 pm, where we were promptly ignored for almost 20 mins. It wasn't crowded, but this location rarely is crowded, because it's location is somewhat in the cut. After alerting the management we left.  Decided come back another time, I know I am a glutton for punishment, but I'm a points member & love the chips with salsa.  On my last occasion, we came earlier in the day during lunch. It still wasn't a typical crowd, like I am used to seeing at a Chilis. The staff were attentive. However, there were FLIES everywhere. in between the booths, around our food, on some of the other tables. NOPE NOPE NOPE.

Nancy M.,"Bel Air, MD",9,59,16,1.0,5/15/2013,"I eat at Chili's when I am jonesing for Steak Fajitas.  We usually eat in the bar area, and except for a miss here and there, it usually lives up to my expectations.   One lunchtime nearly 6 months ago, I ate here with friends.  We had the 2 server tag-team thing.  Neither of them could be bothered with us (3 at our table on a tight lunch schedule).  We did order, but the food was very long in coming out.  We finally asked the manager and it was brought by her.  Never really saw our team, until of course the bill was presented with a smile and a ""hope you enjoyed everything.""  Unfortunately for her that day, one member of our party was not having it and insisted on the manager coupons. 1 star for lack of service. Another time, several months ago, I took my daughter and her boyfriend here for dinner and their steaks (ordered mid-rare) came out after a long wait very well-done.  They got sent back and after another very long wait (during which time the others in the party completed our meal) their steaks arrived.  The server blamed the kitchen saying yes, she did put it in mid-rare.  The manager came out and said, we are very sorry about that.  And that was it.  A 2 to 3 star experience due to service. Now we got on a streak and several months go by where everything is hot and yummy.....mmmm..... As with all streaks, this one had to be broken.  As we were sitting in the bar, I ordered a cordial afer dinner drink straight up (neat, though I said, and it was verified, straight up, no ice).  It was brought with ice.  And sent back since I did not want this beverage cold.  We watched and it sat on the bar counter for a few minutes, the bar tender poured off the cordial into another glass and gave it back to me.  Now it was cold and watered down.  I watch enough Restaurant Stakeouts and Mystery Diners and anything Gordan Ramsey to know that this is a no-no...  it was 4 stars up to that point, but took a nose dive to 2.... Now we come to today.  I didn't bring my lunch to work and pretty much didn't really want fast food.  Ahhh....let's give Chili's To Go a try.  I order the Chicken Fajitas Combo.   I picked it up in the bar of the restaurant and took it back to work.  (I work like a few minutes away).  I forgot to mention I got a side of onion strings, and who can resist partaking on the drive back.  They were stone cold as soon as I got them.  Still tasty, because after all, they are deep fried onions.  But cold...not warm or tepid.  Cold.  I opened up the Fajitas. Every thing was cold except for the flour tortillas, which were pretty hot.  3 of the pieces of chicken were raw in the very middle (see above love of all things Gorden Ramsy and I could hear him disgusted in my head) and the onions and peppers were not ""fajitacized.""  It was so sad.  I made up a fajita with the safe chicken and veg and stuff.  By this time the tortillas were solidifying (spare me the use of micro-waves in restaurants!).  Frankly, it was just...ICK.   Half star (I was going to type 1/2 but was afraid it might be equated to 1-2 stars) for food and I hope I don't get sick, but my office is very close to the ladies' room so I should be good...

She checked on the one thing I asked about and then said ""sorry a lot of our stuff has onion in it.""  Really?  No, really?  In front of her I closed my menu and told my friends to order saying I just won't eat, if they have nothing I can eat..  She didn't even attempt to ask a manager or chef to find me something.  She didn't even suggest I order dessert.  It is absolutely not okay to let your customer sit here and watch others eat, Ms. Christina.  I will never come here again after this experience.  After being made to feel like it's ok for me to just not eat rather than her taking the time to ask anyone else what is onion free, I'll take my business elsewhere where they do care and I hope you do too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-timonium?start=40
J. G.,"Glen Arm, MD",2,7,,2.0,3/8/2015,"My wife and I went on a Saturday evening arriving at 7:15.  Quite busy but the crowd appeared to be moving.  Was told the wait would be ""about 35 minutes.""  Then noticed people who came in after us being seated, some twosomes and some larger groups. At the one hour mark I approached the young man who was handling the seating and asked him where we were in the queue. He had to dig through 3 sheets of paper (?) and it was obvious he had lost our reservation. I got the ""escape"" comment, ""You are next on the list.""  Seated at the table and waited another 10 minutes before a waitress showed up.  I asked to see the manager, and I voiced my displeasure to him.  He was kind enough to comp our drinks. Placed our order from the Two-for-Twenty menu; seems like a good value.  Onion ring appetizer was excellent.  My wife got the bacon cheeseburger - really good - and french fries - blah. I got the half rack of ribs with a side of their NEW skillet smoked potato wedges. First the potatoes; unpleasant smoky taste accompanied by a white dipping sauce that tasted like lemon yogurt.  Does anyone really like this combination?  The ribs; most other rib joints would consider this a child's portion.  Six ribs that probably contained no more than two ounces of meat in total.  Tasted okay, but not what could be considered a dinner portion.  Very disappointing visit.  Only the comp drinks, cheeseburger and onion rings elevated this from a one star to two stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-timonium?start=40
S F.,"Perry Hall, MD",27,26,2,1.0,3/2/2013,Have visited several times before with mixed results. Took my grand daughter out for a girl's night. We were there early  on a Saturday about 4.  Waitresses were nice  and attentive until we got our food. Food was good but nothing spectaculsr.  When the food arrived I indicated I needed a refill of iced tea. We finished our meals and still no refill. We looked over the desserts and decided on one. Grand daughter and I waited another 10 minutes watching our waitresses go bye without a nod to us. After we started putting our coats one of the waitresses asked if we wanted dessert. Told her we did 10 minutes ago and I wanted a drink over 20 minutes ago but we don't want anything but the check now. She prompted brought it. As we walked out the hostess asked us to wait as the manager wanted to give us a gift certificate. I declined as I will never go back.  I am a local resident and will take my money elsewhere.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-timonium?start=40
J J.,"Baltimore, MD",0,18,,1.0,7/1/2009,This is a Chili's restaurant that tastes just like any other Chili's you may walk into.  The sandwiches are pretty good and the food is rather inexpensive.   Unfortunately their service is severely lacking.  I normally don't come on here to complain about bad experiences but I feel I should to warn potential diners about this place.  We were seated right away and ordered an appetizer and main course.  The busboy bring out our appetizer and main courses at the same time.  I fins it very annoying when you don't have time to finish your appetizer.  I was just scratching my head as to how it took the same amount of time to put chips in a bowl as it did to cook a burger well done.  We complain to our waiter and he jokingly assures us that they aren't trying to rush us.  A few minutes later we are given the check before we finished either the appetizer or main course.  The place wasn't full so I get what the hurry was to get rid of us.   There are a lot of chain restaurants in the area where you can get an affordable meal.  I recommend finding somewhere else with some better customer service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-timonium?start=40
Rusty S.,"Washington, DC",0,28,,2.0,12/23/2011,"Why does this place have business? They have a bar. People clearly don't come for the food. Or the service. I've been to this location more times then I'm proud of, mainly due to friends who aren't the biggest foodies. I've never had a meal that stood out as tasty or memorable. I'd be hard pressed to remember what I had during any particular visit.  I went with my mom for a little college acceptance congratulatory lunch (GO GWU COLONIALS), and literally had to hold our waiter hostage in order for some attention. Usually Chili's staff is overly sugary to the point that your I.Q. is slightly lowered, but not our waiter. He had that ""I'd rather be at a Dave Matthews concert"" attitude and spoke to us twice during the whole meal. He left our check with us after he took our order. Weird, right? My mother got a fajita sandwich, and I ordered sliders. Neither meal was very interesting, but hey, it was better than nothing  I guess. For dessert we had the molten chocolate cake. For some reason, I enjoyed it more when I was nine. There's many other restaurants out there, so you might as well spend your hard-earned cash at a good one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-timonium?start=40
Marvin M.,"Reno, NV",0,21,,4.0,8/30/2008,"You know what you're getting when you walk into a Chili's: the chain is widespread enough that the menu and the ambiance are certain to be familiar. The food here lived up to expectations, and the atmosphere was pretty fun, with the wait staff doing a birthday at a table behind us. We were actually a little cold in there, as the AC was cranked up when it didn't need to be, but the reason I'm writing this review is to thank our great server for her very solid work. We were two low end customers, buying items off the cheapest part of the menu and not having drinks or anything, but we were totally treated with courtesy and respect. That's a touch of class! Thanks for the top treatment- just wish I remembered your name. (She was a young blonde lady, but I think they had a few that night....)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-timonium?start=40
