CynNJosh O.,"Stoughton, MA",15,27,33,4.0,10/5/2017,Mitch the server was great; & our dinner was cooked very well. We enjoyed our sirloins with shrimp and strawberry lemonades. The appetizer of wings & molten cake for dessert was delicious. One of the best Chili's I've been to & would go again if again in the area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-toledo
J T.,"Toledo, OH",0,12,,1.0,1/1/2018,"After waiting forever to be sat we got a treat for a waitress. After bringing the app actually asked us ""do you really need plates?"" ARE YOU KIDDING ? Ordered mayo on the side , didn't come when served. Waited 11 minutes for a SIDE of mayo. Only time the waitress was friendly was letting us know she needed ""fives"" when we tipped . FiveS ? You got the appropriate tip for the horrendous service. By the way rib meat is supposed to FALL OFF THE BONE. Instead you heat lamp them. Kudos",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-toledo
D J.,"Toledo, OH",1,11,2,1.0,11/21/2016,"A few years ago, I was served a beer here. I had drank almost the entirety of this bottle when I saw it.  It wasn't easy to notice in the dimly lit dining area.  But the bottle was covered in mold.  Gross. I will never eat here again.   That leads me to tonight. It's been a while, why not check it out again?  It was not very busy at all on a Monday night around 6. My loaded fajita was sizzling hot, the side of rice and black beans, cold.  My 4 yr old's burger bites, undercooked.  No kid needs med rare burger... Nobody came by to refill our drinks(until after our meals were finished), and our finished plates were never removed from the table.  It seemed our waitress had been assigned a large party...and we were forgotten. Overall, underwhelming food, frustrating service, and a reminder why I haven't eaten here in years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-toledo
Young M.,"Toledo, OH",0,16,,1.0,1/10/2017,"This place is the actual definition of a dumpster fire. I have eaten at Chili's in many different areas, most fairly good, but this location is absolutely disgraceful, and I will never return. My girlfriend and I went to the lights at the zoo, and then to chilis for dinner afterward. The restaurant was dead (8pm), yet it took 15-20 min (no exaggeration) to be greeted. The bartender served us, and had a very dry personality. He had no urgency or desire to help us or talk to us. We ordered the fried pickle appetizer, and it was disgusting!!! No pickles, just burnt pieces from the bottom of the fryer.  When the food came out, everything was bad. I hate to be this harsh, but between the two of us, the only thing we enjoyed was our waters. I had sent a tweet out complaining about my experience, and I received a $20 gift card and an apology from corporate. I was surprised and pleased, and thought I would give it one more try.  On Thursday evening, I ordered a to-go order of chicken quesadillas. The girl told me it would be 15min. 20min later, I arrived, and the same bartender who waited on us before acted clueless as to what was going on. I sat alone at the bar and drank 2 beers, all while listening to the manager constantly screaming at people in the kitchen. Again, the restaurant was not busy at all. In fact, I only noticed 3-4 tables being occupied.  After waiting another half hour (50min total) I finally got my to-go order. When I got home, they hadn't put any chicken in my quesadillas, and did not give me the guacamole I ordered and was charged for. Although the meal was technically free, and I am thankful for that, they again screwed me over, and acted like jerks in the process. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. I will never go back to this Chili's, and I strongly encourage everyone else to stay away from it. It's one of the worst restaurants I've been to in the Toledo area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-toledo
Nic W.,"Adrian, MI",32,45,178,4.0,6/23/2016,We have eaten at this Chilis several times. The staff is always friendly. This location was recently updated (2015) and has a very nice look and feel. The restaurant is clean and the noise level is not to bad. The wait staff has alway been prompt and accommodating. Chilis is kid friendly as well. Tv's are placed around the siting areas as well as the bar area. Food is always consistent and if we have had an issue the staff works diligently to fix the issue.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-toledo
Racheal N.,"Toledo, OH",9,10,10,1.0,4/13/2016,"I would give zero stars, if possible.  My son goes to sensory integration next door, every Wednesday. We usually go to kasllys kitchen on his way back to school, but they were closed.  We were there forever! Had the absolute worst food, but the service was decent. Although, I would have liked more than one napkin.  It didn't end there.  The horrible food went home with me...  My dog even got sick after I have him my burger.  Either expired meat or improper food handling. Enough to say no thank you when offered to go back for free.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-toledo
Kelly L.,"Sylvania, OH",0,9,,2.0,12/27/2016,"Pros: food is always good and the store is always clean Cons: pretty much only con.. but it's an annoying one. I've ordered to-go four times, and 3 out of 4 times it hasn't been ready. And it hasn't been because they're busy or that it's almost ready, it's because they haven't even started it. Tonight I was there 10 minutes after the pickup time, arrived to an empty restaurant (for the most part) and they hadn't even started it. The bartender asked me if I was sure it was this store that I ordered from. So now I'm sitting at the bar while they just started my order... and this is the THIRD TIME this has happened.  I would recommend eating in and NEVER ordering takeout from here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-toledo
Wendy F.,"Bowling Green, OH",19,15,,1.0,11/15/2015,"I normally love Chilis, Not this location. Poor drinks, missing food from our order, the food that was served was burnt, dry and lacked sauce. Our server was slow and kept forgetting things. We will NOT be going to this location again!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-toledo
Jill A.,"Toledo, OH",17,32,,5.0,5/7/2017,"We went to Chili's a few years ago and it was'nt good at all, so we gave it a miss until last week. We called in because we were near there and I thought it may have improved. Wow!! The food was great!! I had the steak with avocado slices and salad, it was cooked to perfection!! The service was good, the waitress really took time out to make sure we looked after. Will definitely make it a weekly spot!! Thank you Chili's!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-toledo
Beth H.,"Ann Arbor, MI",287,892,1041,4.0,4/23/2013,"I love Chili's - if we can't think of a place to go to eat, we find a Chili's and everyone is happy.  What made us happier was the bottles for wine for $20.  Shared of course.  Spicy shrimp tacos are perfect and with an appetizer of the onion straws and jalapenos, to top the tacos, it was fabulous!  Had a cup of the loaded potato soup.  Really tasty.  Salad didn't look very appetizing so I left that alone. Seems like the menu had something for everyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-toledo
Jacob V.,"Toledo, OH",1,13,,5.0,5/4/2015,"I have been to this location many times and there was never really anything to write home about, basically your typical chain restaurant experience. Now, for the 5 star review. I went to this location yesterday with my wife's family to celebrate my brother-in-laws 22nd birthday. I had some of the best customer service I have ever had. our every need was taken care of and with a smile! It seems apparent to me that they have taken many steps to improve their customer service and atmosphere, from the games/ digital menus they have on the tables all the way to the servers.  Their food seems to have had an overhaul too, the chips they give you were some of the best chips I have ever had at a restaurant, fresh out of the fryer, they were great! everyone's food was cooked well and the one complaint we had was taken care of without question.  I will say though that about 99% of the amazing experience we had was because of our awesome waitress Allison. I highly recommend requesting her on your next visit. Her attention to detail, professionalism, and  her ability to make you feel at home will definitely make me a returning customer! If she happens to read this, thank you so much for your awesome service!!! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-toledo
James M.,"Newport, MI",57,709,347,2.0,7/28/2015,"USUALLY really like Chili's? However, this particular location seemed dirty & service was not the best. Went kinda late on a week night. Food was neither hot, nor fresh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-toledo
Jim B.,"Toledo, OH",4,17,,4.0,7/1/2015,"After my visit on June 14th, 2015.....I wasn't sure I would ever go back.  Due to my posts, I was contacted by corporate and sent a very nice apology and $40 worth of gift cards.  So..we went back yesterday, June 30th.   I had also received a coupon for a free appetizer, so we were going to use that as well.  The only issue was that the waitress might have confused the coupon.  We chose the Texas Bacon Cheese Fries as an appetizer and I gave her the coupon.  A short time later, she arrived with some tortilla chips, salsa and guacamole.  She said, ""I am bringing this out since it will be a few minutes for the fries."".  I think she assumed the coupon was for the guacamole and she did deduct the $5.99 cost from our bill..but not the Texas fries.  However..everything was very good..she was a very good server (other than this mistake). We both had fajitas.  I went with pork carnitas and chicken, and my partner had the shrimp and chicken.  Very filling, tasty and delicious.   While I am still a big fan of locally-owned establishments, they did do a nice job and we were very pleased with the food and other than the appetizer mistake, the service, too.  And...we were full! Thank you Chili's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-toledo
Whitney T.,"Atlanta, GA",459,491,105,3.0,6/24/2012,"I actually had a good experience here during the beginning of this year. I'm not a big fan of Chili's so the food was only ok as usual. However, the 1 thing that made this a good experience was my server. Her name was Shannon and she was really good. I was with a party of about 8-10 people, and they were very difficult. I can't remember what all she had to deal with from the people in my party, but I do remember it being a lot and her nice and professional demeanor never changed. We even kept apologizing to her, that's how bad it was. Hats off to Shannon!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-toledo
Carrie M.,"Monroe, MI",0,5,,1.0,6/4/2016,"I usually love chili's! My experience here was terrible. After waiting over 45 min for our food they brought my sons out first because it was the only plate ready. My son ate first, then our food came. I ordered chicken tacos. They were cold and soggy. Juice dripping from them and the tortilla was mush.  The beans on the side had a hard crust over them like they had been sitting out for days! The side of rice was also inedible. It was hard and cold!  I ended up eating chips and salsa. Service was okay...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-toledo
Dino T.,"Toledo, OH",8,12,,1.0,3/28/2015,Went to Chili's Grill & Bar on Talmadge and was just not good. Had my Family with me to celebrate my daughter's 23rd birthday and the food here was not good. Order of steak & chicken fajitas with no flavor at all. Ordered 2 burgers and realized the wait staff never asked how we wanted them cooked till it was to late. I like a mid-rare burger but got well done. Ordered boneless chicken wings with honey chipotle sauce and favor was burnt on. The manager took back the fajitas and made an order of spicy boneless wings but those came way after most of us were done eating. Will not be back to this middle of the road restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-toledo
Kevin C.,"Temperance, MI",0,9,,2.0,3/6/2016,I went to Chilis on talmadge road and had a very bad experience. I ordered the baby back ribs with a side of barbecue sauce and the sauce was terrible because it tasted more like ketchup than barbecue sauce. I asked the waitress for some honey to mix in with the sauce and they didn't have any. She then offered to exchange the entree for something else. I ordered a steak well done and she brought out someone elses order soon after that and it was only cooked medium. I then asked for some steak sauce for my steak and nobody could seem to find any. I found out they were out of steak sauce and were waiting for the delivery the next day. NO STEAK SAUCE in the entire restaurant! What a Joke! I will definately be taking my business elsewhere from now on!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-toledo
Renae R.,"Toledo, OH",0,34,,1.0,10/6/2015,"I used to be an avid fan of chilis until a couple of months ago when I had a terrible experience.It was busy I get that.I ordered a chicken sandwich and fries and they only gave me the sandwich. After a look from the waitress like she was annoyed it took her 10 minutes to get it. Then my 3 daughters ordered macaroni and fries and on one order she forgot the fries, by the way our plates kept coming out seperate. Anyways she took forever again. Then never once brought out refills of our drinks. There was a big party of people by us and they were getting great service because she wanted that big tip. All in all I will never come back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-toledo
Nick M.,"Bowie, MD",0,3,,1.0,5/19/2015,"Terrible.  Terrible, terrible, terrible.  Exceptionally poor service.  Getting a glass for your beer was like asking for water in hell.  Same with a lime for said beer.  Either be open or closed, but side work and closing duties shouldn't take precedence over customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-toledo
Sasha T.,"Sylvania, OH",0,9,,4.0,5/13/2015,Great fast service! Appetizers are delicious. Your meal comes out at the perfect time. And don't forget dessert! Their skillet cookie is to die for!!
