Angel F.,"Houston, TX",169,142,4,4.0,10/18/2012,"Welcome to Merica!.... This us exactly how I felt when I walked into the chilis too in the Atlanta airport. If just come off a 4 hour flight from JFK that was preceded by a 13 hour flight from Accra Ghana. Alls I wanted was some fried cheesy American goodness and this place rocked my world.  I loaded up on food that I'd never ever ever on my diet, had a cold beer and really just got down. My server (bartender) rocked my world with speed and friendliness. Oh, and he told jokes. Great way to be welcomed back home!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta
Emil C.,"Irvine, CA",413,1057,4137,3.0,1/21/2013,This restaurant was tucked upstairs in the terminal. Either take the escalator or the elevator to get here. It was pretty packed when I got there. Yet I was seated promptly. This was a good place to hang out for a layover. They served common decent beer and most of their menu items looked good. I was pleasantly surprised that the grilled salmon tasted really good. The server was pleasant and attentive even though she was clearly busy attending to a lot of tables.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta

Linda Z.,"Venice, Venice, CA",18,335,510,3.0,5/1/2012,"If you are pressed for time to catch a flight, don't bother with this place. If, however, you have a decent layover or you got to the airport too early, there are worse ways to kill some time. You really need a full hour, minimum. The place is kind of small and gets very busy with people trying to grab a pre-flight meal and/or drink. I've been here a couple of times now, and I've noticed that there are far too many people expecting fast-food type of service. Look. You won't get that here. Bring your patience and an appetite and chill. I always go for the Chipotle Crispy Chicken Tenders (I think that's what they are called).

Lacee B.,"Phoenix, AZ",85,37,,1.0,1/29/2013,Hotlanta! We stopped by here during a layover and had the worst time. The hostess took my name down wrong and got mad when I didn't respond to her YELLING it practically in my face... Our server was nice but rushed us (gave us our menus and then asked what we wanted to order...we hadn't even opened them yet!) Our boneless wings were ice cold. Just unpleasant.

Rhea P.,"Orlando, FL",2497,2038,2171,3.0,10/25/2010,"Ordered from the breakfast menu an item with major modifications.  So happy to report the item was served exactly as ordered.  The taste was acceptable as well. Now, you should know--you may receive service with attitude here.  I'm not sure if this is service ATL style, or just a pocket of rudeness or someone had a fight with the bf before work, but at any rate, not cool.

Sarah C.,"Sacramento, CA",203,1407,309,2.0,10/23/2010,"Starving and it was the ""healthiest"" option of real food offered in that terminal. With out 30 minutes before boarding, I come to Chili's too. The menu sucked so I ordered a side ceasar salad. It took like 10 minutes + for my salad! How long that it take to make a freaking salad?!  I also bought a bottle of water which is the same price as my salad. -__- The salad came with two little containers of dressing which was the only nice thing about this experience.

Samantha E.,"University Heights, OH",174,895,271,3.0,6/27/2010,"For an airport location, this isn't a bad Chili's.  I've only been here once and it was pretty crowded, but service was friendly and pretty fast, all things considering.  If you're in a hurry, ordering to-go is probably a better option.  The food is standard Chili's fare, but a limited menu.  My egg rolls were great. ATL is enormous and there's probably better options somewhere, but for a quick bite and if you're addicted to Southwestern egg rolls like me, it's not a bad place to stop.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta
Robert P.,"Chandler, AZ",18,34,107,1.0,7/23/2011,"Easily the worst dining experience we've ever had. It might have just been an off day but let me tell you from greet to seat to eat it was one issue after another.  The service was slow and unfriendly. The food was cold and overcooked. If you can avoid this place, do it. Unless of course you have 3 hours to kill waiting for your meal in-between flights. Robert Pfeifer",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta
Kristine M.,"Denver, CO",122,171,9,2.0,12/12/2010,"Bleh. My flight was delayed, and kept getting delayed further, and I wanted an adult beverage and meal before my flight, without leaving Concourse A. The Sam Adams place was packed, and had football going, and the Heineken Grill & Bar was super smoky, so I wandered to Chili's Too, up the escalator.  As a single traveler, I got seated right away. Large parties... had a significant wait. Service was a little speedier than you'd get at a standard casual dining chain, but I wouldn't put your name down for a table if they're making last call for your flight.  I got the Quesadilla Explosion Salad, which came with cheese quesadillas. The quesadillas were a bad combination of greasy and bland. The salad was okay, but anything with black beans, corn, and tortilla strips deserves something other than Italian dressing. (I didn't see a list of options, but I'm not saying it wasn't there, either. At any rate, the default should be spicy ranch or ranch.)  I got a Patron Pomegranate margarita. It was tasty, and strong, which it better be, for $12.99. Though if I'd known my flight would be delayed another hour, I would have had a second. It's probably a good thing I didn't, as the entry area is at the top of an escalator, and there was getting to be a bit of a crowd, and since you could see my little table while riding up the escalator, and from the waiting area, I probably wouldn't have been too popular.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta
Cherine A.,"Coconut Creek, FL",734,675,663,1.0,1/6/2009,"I'm not too picky when it comes to airport restaurants, but I will not be coming back to this place the next time I'm in Atlanta. For one thing, the place is way too crowded - it was hard to get my mom's wheelchair through to the table.  The menu is so small that I ordered the only non-greasy thing I could find on there - a side caesar salad.  My mom and I split an order of chips and salsa, and those were admittedly good.  But my salad had old lettuce in it, rendering about a third of it inedible.  And perhaps worst of all, our waiter would not have any eye contact whatsoever.  It was like he made a point to NOT look at us when taking our orders... he was always looking elsewhere in the restaurant.  I know they're busy, but at least look at us when you're talking to us.  It was unnerving. If you have the time to sit down and eat somehwere in this airport, go to SweetWater Draft House, not here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta
Shana H.,"Denver, CO",24,516,253,3.0,11/11/2011,"This place is crazy. It's small, crowded, and, obviously, popular because the line seemed like it never went down (though, I know it did because I got seated) and the wait was horrible. Once I finally was able to get a small table for two with high chairs amidst the rest of the cramped tables, I ordered a regular margarita, chips, salsa, queso, and cheesecake while my coworker shared and ordered a soup or chili (can't remember which).  This place is just so tight (as in lack of space not awesome).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta

Service was OK, food took longer than I expected but my flight was delayed so it was OK. Food was OK, they have full a full bar which is good.

Greg G.,"Seattle, WA",55,49,543,2.0,9/30/2010,"Why do I continue to torture myself with the mediocrity that is Chili's every time I'm in an airport? Why do I do it? Maybe because it looks like fun in there. Maybe it's the neon signs or the little plastic shakers they pour your margarita from, or the line to get in that makes it seem appealing. All of this is an elaborate ruse. The food is passable enough for sustenance - not terrible, certainly not ""good,"" - but not much more. When the server came by to tell me she had forgotten my order, I politely asked if my Southern Smokehouse burger could be cooked to medium. I was told that they had to cook it med-well or well done.

Lauren S.,"Falls Church, VA",73,324,24,3.0,5/21/2011,"I like this place because it's off the main concourse (it's up an escalator) so it's a bit quieter and less hustle-and-bustle. Easy place to kill a few hours between flights, and far better than getting a contact nicotine high from the Heineken Bar across the way (SO SMOKY). Food is standard for chili's, but the prices have been hiked up for airport convenience. It was crazy-go-nuts at 5:30-6:30 on a Friday, and service was a little hit and miss.

Deanna J.,"Atlanta, GA",785,530,806,4.0,1/8/2008,"Ah. One of the rare times when the security line doesn't make you want to run screaming meant time to actually sit down and eat some airport food, instead of cramming 'greasy and annoying to fellow passengers' Burger King into my travel bag. I mean, yes. It's still airport food. But I'm not such one to be prepared enough to pack a homemade sandwich in a little Ziploc bag for consumption within the walls of overpriced and overgreased food. So Chili's Too really was kinda exciting.  The Set Up:  Single diners line up in a fairly efficient line awaiting to be escorted to one of the many tiny tables lined up, ready for between layover diners.  The Entertainment, a.k.a., Your Surrounding Diners: - two pilots at table 15: Man. If I were a pilot I would feel super cool walking around in the airport! (listening intently to their discussion about how they have to work long hours. hoping that this isn't indicative of all pilots being too sleepy to, well, drive those planes.) - table 21: Ok. I hope those dudes are foreign, because are those cowboy hats with feathers? I mean, I'm not sure if they can really pull that off.  - lady at table 18: ooh. She totally got the same salad I did but with fried chicken. I want her salad instead. How is she managing to read that book at the same time as eating that salad?

Chili's in airports -- all of them -- are a pain.  They have an extremely truncated menu, for starters.  But for some reason, they also seem to suffer from a terminal (pun fully intended) case of the slows.  I mean, you'd think people working in an airport would understand that you're in a hurry.  So far, I've never found a Chili's (or Chili's Too) in an airport where ANYONE understood that, and that is particularly true at ATL in both Concourses A & D.   So if you just have to have that Skillet Queso, yes, you can get it.  But don't expect it anytime this year.  And expect to wait for what seems like an eternity in the line that gets you to the table where you'll wait even longer for your order.

They are unapologetically slow and they don't particularly enjoy strangers coming in asking for food and drink. The menu is limited as are the smiles from most of the staff.

Thomas A.,"Kansas City, KS",99,1029,1127,2.0,6/2/2012,"Chili's has a national reputation.  In my opinion, the experiences I've had a Chili's have been rather boring and average.  It's a safe place to take small children and people who aren't interested in anything but the average retail American fare.  I know this sounds snooty and I don't mean it to be, it is just not a very interesting menu and I don't believe it's meant to be.  At any rate, I quit eating at Chili's many years ago.  However, I have stopped in on occasion at the airport in Atlanta.  The breakfast was above average for airport fare.  On this occasion, we stopped in for lunch.  First of all, the hostess was anything but.  She basically waved us over to a wall and said, ""stand over there for me please...""  brushing us off and busily watching everything else but her customers.  She was dismissive, unattentive and lacked basic customer service skills.  No excuse for a national chain like Chili's.  After a few moments, she decided she could relegate us to a table stuffed in a tight space and we agreed because, we didn't have a lot of time, we weren't picky and it wasn't all that bad of a spot.  Our server was pleasant, attentive but way over worked.  She was flying around in a dither and forgetting things.  I think they had her spread out too thin.  We had to ask her several times for extra mayo as did the young man in the table next to us.  I saw her working tables all over the restaurant.  I have no issue with her.  I believe she was doing the best she could.  She kept our sweet tea full and the sweet tea was actually pretty tasty and not overly sweet but, then again, we were in the South, where they know how to make sweet tea.  I had a bacon cheese burger and there was a TON of bacon on it and the burger was more than generous but the bun was dry and stale.  The fries, again, boring and lifeless.  Why?  Why is it so hard to get fries right and for the prices these companies charge for this stuff...?  Well, it's airport/cattle food.  They move you in and move you out and hope you don't get too disappointed because you don't have time.    All this experience did was reinforce in me my belief that Chili's is boring, average and pretty much not worth my time unless I'm desperate, in a big airport...I had Krystle burgers on my return trip through Atlanta and believe it or not?  It was better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta?start=20
Leslie H.,"Pflugerville, TX",123,425,98,1.0,7/23/2010,"I'm not even sure where to begin... Sure, this is an airport location, but it's not designed to be in an airport.  All of the seating is the same as a regular Chili's, so there's no where to put your luggage but in the main walkways. We stopped in at 9am and were thrilled we could order breakfast!  Who knew it would take so long to get our food?  The two girls who sat directly across the aisle from us were seated, ordered, ate, paid, and left between the time we placed our order and got our food.  The main difference: they ordered their food to-go and then ate it at the table.  If you choose to eat here and don't have hours to wait, do what these girls did. The man behind us stood up four times looking for anyone to help him, as all he wanted was hot coffee. Two families at different times sat in a table across the aisle from us, waited for a while, and then left after a waiter/waitress never stopped by to take a drink order. I say all this realizing that you may think the Chili's in the Atlanta airport was busy at 9am, but I assure you it was not.  I was able to count 28 tables from where I was sitting and I only ever saw 4 waitresses.  Of the 28 tables, 7 were occupied by one or two people, 1 had four people, the rest were vacant. For those who are interested, I had the breakfast tacos, which were two tortillas with a heaping mound of scrambled eggs in each taco and shredded cheese.  They also give you a side of salsa.  My husband ordered a breakfast platter with eggs, hash browns, bacon, etc. Overall, the experience wasn't worth the decent yet overpriced airport food.  We would have rather gone somewhere else in the airport that had similar-tasting food with infinitely better service.  Heck, I would have preferred to go to Starbucks to get an overpriced croissant and a coffee...at least you get the items you order within 5 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta?start=20

Unfortunately, I had a worse experience at the Chili's in the ATL Airport.  I made my way to the bar area where I seated myself. The bartender looked at me and said ""Great, what do you want?"" I looked behind me to ensure it was me he was talking to before I begged his pardon. He laughed and I asked politely for a menu and a Blue Moon. He replies, ""We're out.""... I obliged and said okay what else do you have on tap, before he could answer, a waiter who had overheard the conversation comes from the dining room and pours a blue moon for me, into a cup I literally saw him take out of a sink. I inquired about the glass and they were offended. Then, I hungrily order an appetizer. It comes out with a large chunk of hair blatantly obvious. I was offended, to say the least. I returned everything I ordered and made it back to my flight. Mildly aggravated.  Do-not-go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta?start=40
Steven S.,"West Orange, NJ",79,41,22,4.0,9/15/2011,Food was well-prepared and came out quickly.  This was important because we had a flight to make.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta?start=40
Jim C.,"Redwood City, CA",150,1366,711,4.0,3/1/2008,"The only reasonable non-fast food option in Terminal A. I wasn't expecting much from Chili's - the food was just okay but the overall experience was surpisingly good. The place was reasonably big so you didn't feel like a sardine, they seated us promptly despite being very crowded, service was actually friendly and responsive, and our food came out within 10 min.  The mushroom burger was pretty tasty although the patty was a bit lukewarm. The chicken caesar salad was average although some of the pieces of chicken were hard and overcooked. Bottom line: Food wasn't the greatest (3 stars) but for weary travelers, their friendly and prompt service made a nice difference (+ 1 star) = 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta?start=40

A.L. S.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",229,263,207,3.0,11/3/2010,It's upstairs. The brioche cafe downstairs serves hot croissant sandwiches and paninis and was much better and faster. Kind of hidden in a corner under chilis too restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta?start=40
Heath H.,"Durham, NC",5,70,5,2.0,6/23/2009,Mediocre.  More predictable food than the rest of the restaurants in the airport but it doesn't have quite the flavor of a typical Chili's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta?start=40
keith m.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,10,,1.0,1/2/2012,"Worst service imaginable. Got our order wrong twice, and didn't let us know they we out of two of our four entrees until the other food was served.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta?start=40
Chris G.,"Concord, CA",474,562,367,2.0,7/14/2009,"We were hoping to go to the TGIF in the airport, but Chili's had to do since we were starving. The food tasted fine but like others had said it is a little cramped. One thing I thought was weird, was when the manager brought high chairs for the kids, he just took the extra chairs and but them between 2 tables which make it hard for the patron who were sitting there to get out.  If I have to go back to the airport I'll make sure to look elsewhere to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta?start=40
