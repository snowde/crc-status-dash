Becky S.,"Wolfeboro, NH",210,448,21,4.0,7/24/2007,Your average Chili's with great two-seater booths in the bar area.  Perfect for a gossip session with your best friend.  Bonus: it's in the Colorado Mills Mall... so if you go out to lunch then you have an excuse to shop!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-lakewood
Rachelle T.,"Denver, CO",0,12,,1.0,6/4/2012,"Convenient place to stop and grab a quick fix while shopping at Colorado Mills. I've been here several times and the service is ALWAYS lacking. One visit when I ordered a coke I took a sip and commented to the waiter, ""this is flat, it doesn't have any carbination"", to which he replied ""yeah, our machine is broke"". Wouldn't you tell a customer that prior to bringing them a flat soda??? Not to mention it took 10 minutes to get our drink order. This last weekend my fiance and I visited again during a trip to the mall. We sat at the bar after telling the host, we had several employees walk past us, another customer sat down after us and was immediately brought a menu, I looked at the host and he said ""one minute"", we waited another 5 minutes (total of 10-15) and got up and left. This place has horrible service...totally incompetent staff. If you're looking for a good place at Colorado Mills, go to California Pizza kitchen. Their service is remakable and food is fresh and delicious!!! Look at my review on them!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-lakewood
Monarch B.,"Zephyr Cove, NV",0,126,41,1.0,4/14/2012,"Don't bother. We ordered a a to go dinner during a business trip and regretted the entire ordeal. It took forever, and when I got back to the hotel I realized they gave me the wrong order. I called them back to get the order straight and had to wait again to get the right one. For my trouble they told me I could keep the wrong order. As to the food? Greasy, fatty and loaded with salt. You would do better going across the parking lot and order from the deli at King Soopers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-lakewood
J K.,"Denver, CO",32,116,9,4.0,5/17/2012,"I'm giving a Chili's--not even a  ""full"" Chili's, since it's got that little ""Too"" after it--that's located in an outlet mall 4 stars up there. And no, I don't enjoy their 15-year old chain restaurant recipes. You wanna hear this. With a movie showtime fast approaching, we reluctantly decided to grab drinks and an appetizer before our movie after finding the Yard House packed with a 40-minute wait. I dragged my feet into this dead chain and cringed as the overly enthusiastic waitress buzzed by us with a tray of natchos and a super-fast ""Welcome to Chilli's, we'll be right with you guys!"" We headed straight for the bar. Whereas the Yard House's happy hour ends at 6, Chillis' was still going strong. AND there was a guy with a sweet vintage Fender playing some really good, light, quiet blues in the bar area. We weren't the only ones enjoying his vibe and Bob Marley covers; throughout the five or so songs we caught, his tip jar filled up. We threw in a dollar on the way out. So we were pleasantly surprised by the little oasis this Chilli's offered on a Friday night. A chill bartender, late happy hour, no crowds, a house marg, a couple of tall Coors, a Triple Play and some good blues? Not bad at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-lakewood
