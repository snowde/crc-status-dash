Evanna P.,"Murray, KY",0,2,2,4.0,3/8/2011,"Arrived right before lunch & were waited on quickly. The food took about 30 mins to arrive and was excellent. The server was very nice & attentive. We ordered the jalape√±o fries appetizer, the basic burger, bacon burger & chipotle chicken, all excellent & good portion sizes...equal to the price. Though I tend to look for less pricey places, I feel we got our moneys worth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-nashville
