Deezy C.,"Sterling Heights, MI",16,64,244,3.0,11/25/2017,Its been a while since i had Chili's. Decided to come here for lunch after i kept seeing their commercials on tv lol. They were showing this new burger and it looked very good so you know i have to try it. My brother and i got the Southern Smokehouse burger and the chicken crispers with waffles. The burger was suprisingly good. I didnt expect much from it because of the chain restaurant but wow this burger was that good. Its way better than what i had at Mercury Burger Bar. The crispers and waffles were okay. It was too sweet for my liking and the chicken was dry. It didnt had enough crunch to it and was kind of difficult to chew. The fries that came with the burger was warm and crispy while the ones that came with the crispers and waffles were cold and soft.  Chili's is a okay chain restaurant to dine in. Good prices and many options to choose from on the menu. I'll for sure be back to try their other burgers they have to offer,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-troy
Renee R.,"Highland Park, MI",0,6,8,4.0,1/8/2018,"Staff was super friendly and inviting. The food... Sigh... It was not great. We started with chips and salsa. The chips were greasy and rubbery. The salsa was the consistency of a thin tomato soup. I ordered the Buffalo Ranch Chicken Sandwich. It came with a large chunk of limp, wilted lettuce and an old tomato slice soaked in watery ranch dressing. The chicken was not spicy but extremely salty. It was a tough date night. Sigh...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-troy
Marc D.,"Detroit, MI",14,12,576,1.0,1/2/2018,"This location absolutely sucks.  Cold appertizer, and they also couldn't get the drink order right as well as being slow as molasses.  We left before it got any worse, as the management didn't seem at all concerned about our complaints.  SAD...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-troy
Angela R.,"Gladstone, MI",31,7,,1.0,1/6/2018,"The poor manager tried, but it was dirty and unorganized.  Our waitress was swearing in the bathroom and then ran out without washing her hands, so the food was pretty unappealing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-troy
Julie G.,"Hazel Park, MI",8,3,,4.0,11/24/2017,"We almost didn't come here based on past experiences but decided to give it a try because we had seen the ads saying they changed their menu.  Menu choices in the past were awful and the food not very flavorful.  Tonight was much different.  We arrived around 8 on Black Friday and were immediately seated (being so close to Oakland Mall, I was ready for a wait).  Our waiter was Isaac and he was an absolute amazing and friendly guy!  The shrimp/chicken fajitas were flavorful and plenty and I didn't have to ask for more tortillas because they gave me four instead of the small 3 in most places.  My husband had the sirloin and he said it was great tasting and perfect size...even better than the steak he had at Outback down the street last week.  All in all, our experience was fun and problem free.  Thanks Isaac for your friendly and fast service!  And thank you Chili's for changing the menu, next time I come I'm getting the burger!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-troy
Jeremy N.,"Southfield, MI",422,335,20,3.0,4/5/2017,"Last minute decision to visit this location on a Thursday night. The food was pretty good, expect for us asking for no chipotle sauce on the flatbread and it still came with it. However, the big below average aspect of the night was the service. It was quite slow and the place was not very busy. Not sure what the problem was, but the drinks and the food were overall okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-troy
Susan P.,"Madison Heights, MI",12,9,,1.0,7/24/2017,"Would give a zero if I could. Just left without being seated. There were two other parties waiting.

Karlie S.,"Franklin, MI",43,34,9,4.0,2/11/2017,"Visited because we had collected multiple gift cards over the years from family members. Finally decided to give it a try.  Over all, experience was pretty good. The waiting staff was awesome and friendly. Along with the place being packed it was a good sign. Bottomless drinks are always a plus, except we would of appreciated some glass glasses. Plastic just made the place feel a bit cheap. I got the shrimp and steak. Meat was amazing, cooked exactly how I asked. The potatoes were a bit on the sticky side along with the asparagus being under cooked. Would not recommend the sides that come with the meal. My boyfriend got the smoke house combo. The corn was more butter than corn, also total mush. Once again, meat was great. Over all it was a fun place to try. I don't think we will be coming back unless we collect more gift cards though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-troy
Brittany R.,"Detroit, MI",55,228,102,3.0,4/27/2017,"i hadn't been to a chili's in years, and i had a coupon so i figured why not try it out? i was afraid considering every single chili's near me had bad reviews here on yelp, but i decided to try this location since it's closest to me. i was super impressed by the food. everything was literally smoking hot, i almost burned my mouth a few times which is shocking to say. i cannot tell you the last time i ate food at a restaurant that was so hot i had to let it cool off. i ordered the honey chipotle chicken crispers, and my fiancé tried the smoked combo with ribs, bbq chicken and chicken crispers. his dinner came out with no bbq chicken, but cheddar sausages instead. i let the server know and it was no big deal but she decided to bring the chicken out and let him keep the sausage free of charge which was super nice of her! the reason why i can only give this location three stars is because they screwed up toward the end. when i went to use my $10 off $30 coupon, the server showed some frustration as if she didn't know how to use the coupon. she ran off to the back and 5 minutes later the manager comes out and asks to see the coupon on my phone. i show her the coupon and she scrolls a couple times and says ""well, this coupon can only be used on the buffalo bleu cheese chicken crispers"" um, no. first of all i am not an idiot, don't try to pull a fast one like i was born yesterday. the real problem was that neither her or the server new how to scan the bar code for the coupon, because there was no promo code listed. so for this she tells me i can't use the coupon which pissed me off. i wouldn't have been upset had she just told me that the restaurant wasn't participating or something of that sort. but to try and cover up the fact that you don't know how to do your job is just ignorant. she's a manager she could've easily taken the $10 off manually! i complained to corporate and am receiving a gift certificate, so we will see if they have trouble scanning that as well!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-troy
Tanisha H.,"Warren, MI",1,6,,5.0,11/28/2016,"I would like to commend the OUTSTANDING service provided to my family and guests at the Chili's restaurant in Troy, MI (Oakland Mall). Specifically, our servers, ""Nicole"" (waitress) and ""Mark"" (waiter), as well as the manager, Jason, served us SO WELL that we felt like royalty! Their attitudes and treatment were EXEMPLARY, especially considering the fact that they were seving over 40 people in our group, including over 30-8th graders from the Cornerstone Christian Nevada Middle School in celebrating my nephew, Bernard's, 13th birthday. Mark and Nicole were patient, kind, friendly, attentive, accommodating and professional.  The EXCELLENT service provided by Nicole, Mark and Jason needs to be acknowledged, recognized and commended. They represented the Chili's brand very well. We were EXTREMELY grateful, thankful and appreciative that they were a part of our day and instrumental in making my nephew's 13th birthday celebration a wonderful success.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-troy

Stephanie B.,"New Baltimore, MI",56,299,324,3.0,12/30/2014,"This particular Chili's isn't anything to write home about.  My Aunt and I stopped in on Saturday for lunch after visiting Oakland Mall. We thought it was an Applebee's, judging by the back of the building that doesn't have a sign but has green and red paint. We quickly realized it was a Chili's and still decided to eat there.  We got seated immediately and got our drinks right away. We ordered the 2/$20 meal with chips and guacamole for the appetizer.  I ordered the grilled chicken salad- minus tomatoes, salsa and dressing, while my aunt ordered chicken fajitas.  My salad was perfect- except it had dressing on it. Waitress never came back to check on us until a manager dropped our bill over nearly 40 minutes later.  My Aunt said her chicken for her fajitas was very bland and tasteless.  Service was very slow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-troy
Rhonda L.,"Southfield, MI",26,28,2,3.0,1/10/2017,"My husband and I decided to go here for dinner this evening. My coworker had given me a gift card for Christmas that needed to be used. Our server was just horrible! She took our appetizer order which was the Southwest egg rolls. When they were done, she came to our table and just drop them off and walked away as quick as she came.  We had to wait about five minutes before she came back to tell her that we did not have silverware and and/or napkins. She brought us our silverware and stated that she could not find napkins and set down three wet wipes on our table and told us that this would have to do and walked away!! Our dinner order came and I have to say the food was actually really good. Again the only problem that we had was that whenever we needed something - such as dipping sauces and refills for our drinks, our waitress was nowhere to be found. We actually had a different waitress bring us our refill. I asked her to just bring me water that way if I needed refills, I could go into the restroom and get my own!! Our waitress finally came over and gave us some carry-out containers and our change from the bill. She told us she gave us an extra dollar since the register had no change! I can't say that we won't be back, I just hope we get a different waitress!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-troy
Nikki W.,"Royal Oak, MI",0,6,1,1.0,9/23/2016,There was a piece of paper in my soup. Our waiter acted as if nothing was wrong and that it wasn't a big deal. Didn't seem to concerned about the situation. He didn't even send the manager over either.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-troy

George P.,"Royal Oak, MI",0,1,,2.0,3/21/2017,I ordered the Smokehouse 1/2 slab rib dinner with mashed potato last night.  On arrival my ribs were not served hot but the potatos were hot.  I complained to my waitress and she took the ribs back to the kitchen to reheat.  After the ribs were returned they were very dry after reheating.  The Manager came to my table and credited my dinner bill.  I have been a fan of this location for years but not the last two outings.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-troy
Natalie W.,"Warren, MI",81,2,,1.0,12/29/2016,"Terrible service. My soup got given to another table when it was supposed to be mine. The server just said it nonchalantly, like ohp whatever. That's why I came to chili's in the first place was for the soup. That was the last bowl of soup they had. They also were out of fries. And I wanted to get the Texas cheese fries...nope. The manager didn't care about anything I was saying... my server was very inattentive, and didn't come to ask how we were doing till when we needed boxes. She gave us the bill and didn't come back for the payment 20 minutes later. I know what to do and expect with restaurant service... I work in a chain restaurant, I was very unsatisfied with this restaurant and how the manager handled the situations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-troy
Jardana I.,"Hamtramck, MI",49,8,2,1.0,12/29/2016,"The service was extremely poor. We had 158 reward points so we decided to redeem the reward for salsa and chips, AFTER redeeming it, the server said that we can't get the salsa and chips because we already ordered one of the meal deals. So not only did we not receive our redeemed reward, but we also lost all 158 points. The server was nowhere to be found after taking our order, she did not refill our drinks, give napkins, or help us in anyway. We ended up asking another server for help. This was my favorite location but I honestly don't think I'll be coming back. I understand that the restaurant was packed due to the holidays, but seriously disappointed on the service. You can stop by once or twice to check up on the people you decided to serve, but no. She didn't come by AT ALL even if we called out to her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-troy?start=20

Zakia T.,"Madison Heights, MI",62,5,,2.0,3/15/2016,"Wow.  When I say that I mean bad wow. The service was pretty bad. My friend and I went in and waited 15 minutes (which was to be expected on a weekend night). I knew who our server was because she keep making eye contact with us and walking around that particular section that we were in but never actually came over till 10 minutes later. 10 minutes!? I totally would've been fine if they had came to us and said ""I'll be with you guys as soon as possible."" But nope it helps me a lot by letting me know that we actually had a server waiting on us because I seriously thought we had no server! That was just the start of this displeasurable visit. Once she was with us she told us her name and suggested us some drinks which was fine but the whole time she was staring into space, no eye contact at all, which to me was a bit odd but moving on. We actually asked her to take our order as well because we knew it would be a while. Another 10 minutes later and we got our two waters.. Why did it take that long? She was not busy at all, and I knew because I was watching our server do nothing for 10 minutes. Our food came out at a reasonable time thank god and the quality was quite alright. We finished our food and she finally came back asking if we want dessert and to promise to give her a great review... This was so awkward to me because she asked for a great review. There's a huge difference between ""Hey guys please leave me a review on how I'm doing it would help me much"" and ""promise to give me a great review?"" Wow!!! We left her 20% and ran out as soon as possible! We left her 20% why? Because I work at a restaurant as well and now about tipping out the busser, expos and what nots. Before we got out the door I told my friend, ""The last question they ask me on the kiosk was, how was your experience here? And I said bad"" there was a couple of ladies standing outside and overheard me say that and guess what! They laughed and said ""We said the same thing!""

The place is a mess dirty and unorganized, the waits for the food was way to long the menu still sucked the choices were same old same old chilies , mistake should of picked anywhere but here. But there's not much around Oakland mall and we ended up here. Note to self off the list. Wanted to add more details to my review. When we were seated their were 3 tables that had dirty dishes plied on them, the floor was a mess with food and yuck all over it, I ordered drinks and a beer, mentioned that we were kind of in a hurry to make a movie, so we ordered right away, she brought the water and pop no beer said she would be right back, ten min later she comes back still no beer, I ask, she says oh sorry I forgot. Then we wait 45 min for the food to finally come, the food runner walks passed our table with our food go's to all the tables around us, he has no idea where it go's he starts to go back to the kitchen, so I yell it go's here.. so we finally get some off our food.

Ryan B.,"Clawson, MI",50,12,,1.0,1/4/2015,"We have long been patrons of the Chili's at Oakland Mall, after how we were treated by the staff the other night, I doubt we will come again.  My wife and I stopped in to this said establishment at approximately 9:15 p.m. on Friday, January 2, 2015. The restaurant was about 2/3 empty and we were met by a friendly gentleman who asked how he could assist us. We mentioned that we wished to sit in a booth and he explained that they should be able to accommodate us. He walked with menus to the west side of the restaurant to look for a table (presumably). He then handed are menus to a very petite hostess with dark hair and braces.  He yelled down to us that she would be happy to seat us.   He then walked away and the petite hostess walked toward us and then for some reason, put our menus down and walked over the east side of the restaurant to talk with a couple of waitresses at the station on the east side of the restaurant. We waited for about 5-10 minutes and then she came back to ask if we can be help us (which she should have already known since she was holding our menus for us before inexplicably putting them back). I explained to her that we were still waiting for a booth and she asked if we would be willing to sit at a table. I told her ""No, we have been waiting here for 10 minutes for someone to seat us in a booth. Wasn't someone cleaning one of for us?""  She then said ""ok"" and walked back over to talk with the waitresses on the east side of the building and spoke with them for another 5 minutes. As they were laughing and carrying on (at which time my wife noticed that there was probably upwards of about 10-15 empty booths on the east side of the restaurant and possibly some on the other side as well but we could not see the West side of the restaurant from the entry way) and then she came back and said that she was not willing to seat us because ""the section was closed"". My wife and I looked at each other in disbelief, as it was 9:30 and there were clearly empty booths (again, the restaurant was 2/3 empty). My wife asked her ""you mean to tell me that you are REFUSING to seat us in one of the empty booths and NO waitresses would be willing to wait on us because of this?"" She actually smiled at us and said ""yes, that is correct"". At that point we left. We enjoyed $75 worth of dinner and drinks down the road at a competing establishment.    Living in Clawson the past couple of years, we have spent hundreds (and hundreds) of dollars at this establishment over the last few years. I am still blown away that this establishment would condone for guests to be treated in such a matter. I cannot help but wonder how many patrons have been turned away.

The food its self is good and they always get the order right. (Considering i order multiple items at a time since we order for the office a lot) The only thing i would say is that they could do a better job of answering the phone when trying to place a carry out order.  I have called quite a few times to place a carry out order and no one there even answers the phone, and if they do it rings 15 times before they answer.

Chili's has something for everyone: healthy salads, kiddie food, steak, and other fun food, which I can't resist.  On my last visit, I was able to take advantage of their special, free chips and salsa, offered by a competing ""check in"" application. I also enjoyed the buffalo style chicken fajitas. The chicken had a light breading covered in buffalo style sauce. The chicken itself was moist and juicy. The flour tortillas where soft and served warm. It came with lots of cheese and other goodies to make the perfect faitja!  In addition to the yummy food, you are always greeted by the host when you walk .

I enjoyed the crispy tortilla strips, but I kind of wish it had more chicken. Overall, this is probably one of the most positive experiences I've had at Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-troy?start=20
