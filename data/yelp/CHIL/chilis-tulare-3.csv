Berry H.,"Granbury, TX",48,124,53,3.0,8/22/2017,A pretty cool place to sit and have a beer and TVs are all around great to watch sports and the people behind the bar quite friendly I also enjoy this place because it's centrally located in the area of all the hotels specially the particular one that I stay at Fairfield Inn,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tulare-3
Ricardo S.,"Porterville, CA",55,35,334,2.0,11/27/2017,"Monday Night Football! Walked in and was seated instantly. Ordered chips and guacamole. Took over 20min for this fresh crispy appetizer. Asked for a booster and never received it.  As our order was being taken our waitress never looked us straight in the eyes! She was a little too concerned about the table down from us.  No one is here! Over 30min for our dinner! Please see photos! Read many reviews and, I agree. It was difficult giving this place 2 stars!  Game wasn't even on!

Rachelle R.,"Porterville, CA",9,9,6,2.0,2/19/2017,Normally have a good experience here BUT it took fooorrreeevvvererrtrr to get service once seated then 20 minutes to get appetizers after ordering. The Texas cheese fries were BURNT!!! Sent them back came back burnt again with our food. Mac n cheese was runny and gross. Took over 15 minutes after boxes were brought to get our bills.

Jason Y.,"Tulare, CA",7,19,5,4.0,4/28/2017,"We have been regular customers to this Chili's since it opened several years ago. And visited many other Chili's throughout California. Recently we noticed that the service was much better/friendlier at the Tulare Chili's. It wasn't long ago that a server actually spilled ranch dressing on us. That server just barely apologized to us for being careless.  Tonight however, was a much better experience with our server Kristi. She was awesome! Tended to all of our needs, checked on us regularly and was friendly and smiling the whole time. While Kristi far exceeded our expectations, we have noticed recently all of the staff are better at customer service. I may be wrong, but it seems there may be a new general manager or at least newer. We met her tonight and were very impressed. We watched her bring out food, drinks, checking on orders and customers. Always working and always visible.  I love people who lead by example and have passion for their work. It's contagious and I attribute the better service to the leadership at Tulare's Chilies. Tonight was our best experience at any Chili's, Applebee's, Black Bear, Olive Garden or Cool Hand Luke's. Ever!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tulare-3

We waited 10-15 mins and did not get seated. I didnt not want to sit in the bar area because I had a child with me but it seemed like the only option. There were only four guests in bar and one family in dining area. I told the bartender I was seating myself because I could not get seated she gave me a blank stare and said ok.

Suzy O.,"Visalia, CA",0,79,16,1.0,6/25/2017,"Hubs and I went out for lunch. We purposely sat in the bar because there were NO CHILDREN in there. The bartender (our server) was GREAT. He took our order promptly, and brought our beverages quickly. Mid-way through our meal, a family with two kids (maybe aged 2 and 4) walked into the bar. They'd decided they no longer wanted to sit in main restaurant area (in fact the father was carrying a child in a high chair). At this point, a female waitress (possibly barback) - sat this family at the table DIRECTLY BEHIND my husband and myself. Mind you - every single table in the bar was available!!! The children were loud, whining, the ""father"" was displeased about his soda, and the mother wanted a margarita (can't say I blame her). Our server (the bartender) asked us if we wanted a to-go box... (even he knew we were irritated). We ended our ""quiet"" meal and left with food on our plates.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tulare-3

According to Joshua Glass the restaurant manager the first excuse was they were backed up when the restaurant was half empty. Then it was a power surge then it was a computer error. I will never eat here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tulare-3

The chips were burnt. I asked for extra jalapenos and didn't get any the 1st around, and when I asked again I got some but not extra. One person at my table ordered sour cream but didnt get it first time around. Oh...my hot sauce took a while to get too. My cousin is 8 and ordered the chicken sandwiches but got the hamburger sliders--the bun was hard and patty was burnt. The manager asked if she wanted something else and comped it. My other cousin's salad didn't come before the meal and we had to remind the waitress for it. My 13 year old cousin got the wrong soup as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tulare-3

The muddled waitress who simply brushed us off when we told her it was a terrible experience and that I wanted to speak with a Manager who was mysteriously unavailable?

My friend also had hair in their food. It was disgusting. Their ""fiesta bowl"" I think it's called (it's sort of like a bowl from chipotle, with grilled chicken, rice, black beans, and lettuce and what not) is pretty tasteless and seemed pre-made.

Tara J.,"Pismo Beach, CA",0,10,,1.0,6/19/2016,"I wish i could give no stars .Worst steaks ever. The last prob 5 steaks I have ordered from here were horrible. Always ask for well done and I get the Pink- est bloodiest meat ever. How do I make my 9 year old suck it up and eat it anyways ? I dont. Waste of money.  I mean blood started oozing out before I even cut it with the knife. I know many like their steaks that way and that's fine. But not this gal. So what do I get? 12 and 18 dollar meals not eaten. I mean if they can't read a monitor where it says well done. I will be more than happy to come teach them to read. Not to mention pickup time was 830 and I waited till 9 for anyone to even come talk to me. I even rang the bell. After sitting there for 20 minutes having multiple employees walk by and look at me not asking if I have been helped. Some rude employee comes out and gives someone their order that came in after me!after I was waiting forever as is. You're  kidding me! But told me to ""hold on "" to make me wait that extra 15. . All my food was cold and hard by the time it got here. Luckily my kids are troopers and managed to make Do. But definitely feel it was a waste of money. Especially on father's day! So if you like your order wrong cold or not even there....come to chilis.! Not they suck ! So say I've ordered 50 meals from here ..

I chose to go to the bar. 15 minutes later I still hadn't had a tone come by to take my drink or food order. The couple next to me said they had someone come by but they only asked for water at that time while they reviewed the menu. They said that 20 minutes later they still hadn't received their water. Finally we both got the same waiter to come over. We all wanted a Patron Margarita and they were out of Patron. I thought, no big deal. I ordered a glass of wine. I then ordered one of their burritos, he said they were out of burritos...REALLY? Lousy service, I mean...it's a Chili's so I'm not expecting 4 star service but this one definitely is only a 1/2 star but I can't go lower than 1 star. Management.... stay on top of your business.

Shanelle H.,"Tulare, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/29/2014,"Waited about five minutes to be seated during lunch time in which the restaurant was empty. When seated it took another five minutes to get our drinks. When we received our silverware it wasbdirty, and the salsa was very watery. We asked for a new batch in which the manager was supposed to bring and he never showed.

I have only had one bad experience due to a manager at the Tulare site. When he found out, he came out and made everything right. Great customer service, fantastic employee's. Food to die for and prices that rival anyone. As long as the food stays good and they stay in town, they have a customer for life.

After we ate linner we chose to have dessert ugh! The wild berry cake was in a skillet and should have been warm but was cold inside.

I think not Manager Joshua Glass thanks for telling us not to worry about the drinks after waiting an hour and 42 minutes to get our uncooked food!! Great hospitality. Don't waste your time or money or jeopardize your families health at this so called restaurant.

However our worries of a super long wait with ravenous appetites was quickly put at ease. Despite the heavy crowd we were seated within ten minutes. Now you may think, but hungry girl, how long did you wait for service? Not long at all. Our super awesome, super busy server was with us lickety split. I actually witnessed the poor girl running.  She brought us out our drinks and took our orders. Our appetizers took a wee bit longer than usual, but hey with that crowd we understood. The southwestern egg rolls were yummy. The fried pickles, eh I've had better. The chili queso dip was our fave. I ordered my classic favorite from here. Original chicken crispers with a side of corn on the cob and loaded mashed potatoes. No complaints here. My husband enjoyed the fajita trio. He said the chicken and shrimp were good, but the steak was the best of the three for him.  We all around enjoyed it, good service, good good and good company.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tulare-3?start=20

Rose S.,"Tulare, CA",49,11,4,1.0,2/27/2017,"So I always have ordered on line for the Chili's To Go because I like that I can know exactly what was ordered and every one in my family just passes around the Ipad and get their food exactly how they want instead of me calling it in to try to remember what everyone wants.    My worst experience ever though, was this Friday which has now led me to the conclusion that we will no longer dine at this particular Chili's.  After waiting over 2 hours additional time than what was promised, my order was wrong.  When they realized that they had forgotten to make things on my order, it took an additional 45 minutes for them to get the food correctly to me.  The waitress informed me that they had new staff and thus the mistakes, so as a ""courtesy"" they offered me 1 free desert for my $80+ order (which half of it was freezing cold by this time).  When I got home, the things I ordered were incorrect...

Jon R.,"Tulare, CA",1,4,,2.0,8/10/2016,"I had sub par service with my most recent visit here. I dined in for lunch with a coworker. We were seated promptly. We waited an unusually long time for someone to take our beverage order. Eventually, a server stops and asked if we had been helped. When we responded that we have not, instead of apologizing she deflected with, ""Well I told him you were here. I guess I can help you."" I felt that was just unprofessional and unnecessary to involve the customer in her annoyance with her coworkers. I ordered the bottomless soup and salad which also comes with chips & salsa.  My salad was delivered to the table bus different staff member. I inquired about the status of the chips & salsa.  Our server promptly returned with the tray of chips & salsa and then asked ""You want chips & salsa too?"" I then clarified that they came with the soup and salad. She proceeded to argue with me that I didn't specify that I wanted the ""bottomless"" and since that's not what I ordered do I still want the chips? I insisted that she leave the chips and change my order to the bottomless option. In addition to the above, our drinks were never refilled for the duration of our meal. The food on the other hand was the quality that you can expect from this style of restaurant. I would have appreciated a more customer focused server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tulare-3?start=20

As far as carbon copy menus go, they keep there's the most consistent, and my favorite location by far is this one in Tulare.  When I'm down visiting family, it's imperative to me that we find a good meal that satisfies all our eclectic tastes. Twenty pages+ of menu items, drink refills before you even take a sip, TV's at every angle and kiosks loaded with video games for the nephews are just a few of the many conveniences. Dig into their buffalo chicken sandwich or classic nachos and you've got yourself the best quality controlled meal in city limits.

I go in with my friend Megan Brooks to have a drink and appetizer. We walked up to the hostess station where we tell the manager LJ that we would like to sit at the bar. She says ok it's open setting. I then tell LJ that those tables were dirty. So she then tells us to go stand by the tables  and flag someone down and they'll come clean it (not my job) then we had the worst sever in America (Marissa). I start to do the survey because it was well deserved and ""Marissa) decided so needed to confront me over the fact that I doing the survey. Two minutes after she walks away I am hit with ice. There were people at the bar that said they saw a server throw the ice.

Janett N.,"Pixley, CA",27,1,,1.0,1/5/2017,"This place used to be my go to place. For special dinners or even hanging out with friends. Today was a very important dinner for me, it turned out to be the worst experience I've had here. The final time I step foot into this restaurant.  The place was relatively empty. Few tables and whoever was in the bar. We ordered our drinks from the manager.  And waited about 5 minutes or so. Our drinks were incorrect, but drank them either way. We proceeded to order an order of Texas cheese fries while our food came. They were terrible.  45% of it was burned and stuck to the skillet. Something that's never happened. Their excuse was they didn't butter it. No replacement offered. Once out plates came it was cold. Seemed like they had been sitting out for a long period of time. My chicken was cold in the middle and my sisters ribs were undercooked and cold to the bone. Called the manager over and offered a new rack of ribs. We waited 25 minutes for those ribs and they never came. The waitress never came by to ask how were doing. When we did see her it took 10 minutes to get us forks. As we asked for our check we noticed multiple charges for things we did not order. We were charged 1.99 for ""entertaiment"" we did not use. 12.99 for beer we did not order or drink. The waitress went to speak to the manager. He took her to the kitchen. I saw him grabbing a rack of ribs from who knows where and sticking it into a to go plate. Knocking off the prices for which we were not charged with an additional 15% off . He never ONCE came to apologize.  Instead he cowered into the corner of the kitchen and sent the waitress to apologize. Never stepping into this establishment again. My sister and I both have stomach pains and indigestion after about an hour.  I'm a manager at a business as well, I would never manage my team to treat customers this way in a thousand years.

Once seated we waited another 20 minutes for our drink order after she looked at us and contemplated to help us. It's plain to see why nobody here wears name tags. Because they all provide shitty service. More specific the young lady ( I believe her name is kristie) with the short colorful hair. When dining out you expect a fun experience, and that was an experience I was yet to have. Definitely not worth the money I paid. I tip based off the service I receive so hopefully she wasn't expecting a good tip. I will not be visiting this particular restaurant again. And I will also be contacting corporate for a refund.
