Adam P.,"Memphis, TN",31,31,10,4.0,8/8/2017,"WOW so not sure what the deal is with all the negative reviews.  We were a party of 5 that was seated promptly and greeted by a very polite server. Throughout the experience our food was brought out promptly and as ordered with drinks refreshed several times. The food is standard chain fare and was cooked perfectly fine. Overall, we had a good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tupelo-2
Melissa H.,"Madison, MS",4,22,6,4.0,7/23/2017,"Trey was a great server! Very attentive! The host did seat us at a dirty booth.  We wiped it off with napkins, then he wiped it with a wet towel later.  Everyone's food was good (burger, chicken and waffles), but my cheesy enchiladas weren't that great. The tortillas were hard to eat because they were dry and tough.  Overall it a was a good experience. Trey, our server, really made all the difference.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tupelo-2
Joseph P.,"New Albany, MS",0,11,2,1.0,1/7/2018,"Do not go to this place! I work and live and Tupelo. I have been here several times over the years and it has always sucked! Restaurant is just pitiful. I have no idea why I came here today. The restaurant is not even half full and I had to wait for 10 minutes for somebody to seat me. Wait another 10 minutes for a damn drink order. Waited over TWENTY MINUTES FOR THE WAITER TO COME AND TAKE OUR ORDER!! Ridiculous!! We quit waiting and just went to Olive Garden  next door and was immediately serviced. This has happens every time but I will never come here again in my life. I make sure to tell anybody and everybody I go eat with to never ever go here. Go to Olive Garden, Buffalo Wild Wings, mt. Fuji, Longhorn and anywhere else on N Gloster before you come here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tupelo-2
Michelle C.,"Tupelo, MS",0,3,2,1.0,7/24/2016,"I love the food at Chili's but I am counting calories so I appreciate the lite options part of the menu.  Today I ordered the Spicy Pasilla Chicken for 420 calories. I was very disappointed to receive the wrong sides with my chicken. (See pics) This would not have been so terrible if I had not already waited close to an hour to receive my meal. Yes they eventually made it right, but it was too much trouble and not worth the money and effort.  The customer service at the Tupelo Chili's has gotten worse every time I have been, so I won't be back for some time. Personally I think it is the kitchen staff, not the servers. I was told today they were backed up an hour on tickets as there were only 2 cooks on duty. (Sunday after church)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tupelo-2
Emma C.,"Omaha, NE",0,4,,1.0,11/4/2017,I still haven't gotten over my visit in 2013. First of all the ceiling was leaking. We asked to be moved but they said no. Apparently they are too lazy to move us. So they took our drink order I asked for a kid's cup because I was only 11 at the time. But I got a regular cup. When I ordered my food I got mac and cheese. We got an appetizer of guacamole and chips. When we got it it tasted horrible we asked if they had any more guacamole they said no. When are food came out my mac and cheese tasted awful. My granny got a quesadilla she got guacamole on the side that tasted just fine so they lied to us. Worst experience of my life.

Jay K.,"Oxford, MS",0,6,4,1.0,7/12/2017,"Chilis is one of those chain restaurants that I've always been able to say, ""Let's just go to Chilis"" whenever we didn't have a clue where we wanted to go. It didn't matter where we were in world. Chilis was always an option. Even this Chilis was one of our go to places in Tupelo, MS. But this one has really gone straight down the toilet. The food is horrible now. The service is terrible. We've had to wait forever for drinks, refills, appetizers and the actual main course. I will never set foot in this restaurant again.

Austin L.,"Tupelo, MS",0,14,2,1.0,5/20/2017,Have been here about 6 times in the past 8 months and only two of those times have we had a good experience. I ordered a beverage that I never received.

Steve D.,"Corinth, MS",1,21,17,1.0,1/8/2017,It's a shame to see a quality chain so poorly run.  Early January and it's 30 degrees outside.  It's so cold inside that we both put on coats.  I put my gloves on just for effect.  They didn't get the hint. Restaurant empty but still stood at hostess booth for a couple minutes before hostess appeared. We sat for ten minutes before anyone came to the table.  One of our orders was wrong.  We waited five minutes and no one came by so I went back to the kitchen to tell them.  Only two waitstaff in the entire restaurant.  The only saving grace is that the Molten Chocolate was spot on.  I hope corporate reads this and either whips into shape or shuts it down.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tupelo-2
Alan M.,"Farmington, NH",4,14,2,2.0,6/11/2016,Customer service was ok. She brought me my drink which was mostly water not dr pepper. Food tasted old and was proven when my wife salad had old avacoda in it. Looks like this restaurant maybe struggling financially and cutting cost.

Shea G.,"Ripley, MS",0,4,1,1.0,7/3/2017,"This use to be a go to place for us to eat in Tupelo. You could not go wrong with Chili's. But boy has that changed . We just went in there after a movie on Monday night , the place was filthy. Floors were dirty, table was dirty. The host wiped it off with a napkin. Then the waitress was not familiar with menu at all. We ordered chips and salsa and the menu offered ranch for extra charge , she didn't even bring it. They were out of Dr Pepper and Sprite. I ordered unsweet tea and she brought sweet tea and was aggravated that she had to change it. I order chicken tenders and they were so hard and rubbery I could not cut nor bite them. I sent them back. They took it off our bill, but we will not be back. I hate that it has gone down like that. It used to be a great place for our family to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tupelo-2
Bill R.,"Tupelo, MS",72,183,14,1.0,2/3/2016,"I don't usually review chain restaurants because I don't think anyone needs guidance on what the food tastes like.  I happen to rather enjoy Chili's food.   They make a really nice house salad, I love the chips and salsa.  Everything fried is pretty good and their takes on TexMex are interesting sometimes.  The dry rub ribs are not outstanding, but serviceable. They still have no idea how to steam veggies or make rice.  Paying your check through the kiosk instead of waiting on staff is the best thing ever. So it should be apparent that I'm more or less a fan. This particular location ruins all of that with the worst service you'll find.  Clueless college kid staff that are more concerned with showing you their tattoos or piercings or flexing for the next table than getting the order right.  Being herded into the bar because the dining area is underserviced.  Seating a quiet couple next to a table full of rowdy infants on a mommy margarita lunch when the place is half empty.  Southwestern salads with ranch dressing instead of Southwestern.  Asking me what kind of dressing I want on a Caesar. Not knowing what comes with the meal ordered.  Avacado salad with no avacado.  I once ordered a strawberry lemonade and they brought me lemonade with the strawberry shot at the bottom and told me to stir it up myself, the bar was busy.  I looked over and the bar WAS busy flirting with college age girls sitting at the bar.  Once ordered dry rub ribs and was brought wet ribs.  Pointed this out and she took the plate back.  10 mins later, I got the same plate back with the sauce wiped off and dry rub dashed heavily all over it.  Idiots didn't even hide it - the sauce was still peeking through in places.  When you are lucky enough to get things right, the food tends to be good.  I'm convinced that almost all the problems here come from the wait staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tupelo-2
Dorothy S.,"Columbia, TN",22,4,,1.0,11/8/2016,"This is the WORST Chili's we've ever visited. Service was terrible. At one point, I thought our server had left for the night (she never checked back for drinks, there was a problem with my order and she never came back to explain why things were taking so long. Poor portions, food was not good, and we were in there approximately an hour and a half before finally getting out dinner. We had to get our own silverware, straws, napkins, etc. No apologies, no explanations ... I couldn't figure out if she was just hiding out in the kitchen or had really left for the night. I don't understand how this place stays in business. This is our third trip to this location (we keep hoping this experience is just a fluke) but it will also be our last time there.

Carroll B.,"Tupelo, MS",0,9,,1.0,7/10/2016,"I have been to Chile's before in Cincinnati and Little Rock, and was very pleased. I just had one of the worst experiences ever at a resturant, and it was at the Tupelo Chile's. Compared to the pizza place at Barnes Crossing, they are doing pretty good, but compared to the higher level of service expected of casual dining establishments, they are horrible. We arrived at 11:45 AM on a Sunday, and the restaurant was 25% full, or 75% empty, depending on your perspective. To sum it up, it was 10 minutes before the waitress came to the table, another 30 minutes before the appetizer arrived, and another 30 minutes before the entrees arrived. If you didn't catch that, it was 1 hour and 10 minutes until we received our food. We got really tired of waiting. I mean, really tired. By the time our food arrived, we were so full of soda that we weren't hungry. About 10 minutes before the food came, I was so tired of waiting that I almost told the waitress to cancel the order and bring the check. Won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tupelo-2
Aaron P.,"Tupelo, MS",3,31,68,2.0,10/8/2015,"Never had a problem at Chili's until we visited this location.  Now the Yelp rating makes a little more sense.  Just absolutely awful service.  We sat at the bar for lunch thinking it would be quicker to get in and out.  Wrong.  Bartender had zero motivation whatsoever and had a knack for disappearing for most of our lunch.  Had to ask for a refill, our chips and salsa never came out before our lunch and had to ask for that too.  The food was pretty good, I had the boneless wings and my girlfriend got the tortilla soup.  It all took a long time to come out as well.  I'd say we sat there for a solid hour.  I'd like to give it another chance, but I may give it a while to see if management turns over first.  It's a dang shame the place is operated so poorly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tupelo-2
Kendra W.,"Tupelo, MS",0,42,4,2.0,3/26/2015,"I normally love Chilis! Especially the Southwestern egg roll, but this location leaves so much to desired. Which is a shame, because I had come here a few months earlier and had a decent experience. My husband and I went at the end of the lunch rush and it took a little bit of time to be seated, at least 6-7 minutes. When we were seated, we not only didn't see our server for almost 10 minutes, no one came to give us drinks. Get this, our server was too busy rambling to the table behind us and taking care of them. The woman training our waitress had to come serve us and she didn't come until she saw my husband get up to go look for someone. With that aside, we placed our drink and appetizer orders. We ordered the fried pickles, which were not bad but the drinks were a little flat, but nothing dismal. Once again, we waited a good minute before being to order our meals, I got a cheeseburger and my husband ordered some sort of cheese quesadilla with rice and black beans. My burger was on the dry and season less side (nothing ketchup couldn't fix I suppose) and it was missing a few dressings but oh well. My husband's quesadilla and black beans were good, but the rice wasn't completely cooked!  Our waitress only refilled our drinks once - remember she was too busy chatting away. We were ready to pay and get out of there and once again it took so long to get the check, we just opted to pay at the table kiosk instead of the usual way and left. Needless to say, she didn't get much of a tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tupelo-2

This girl is more intetested in socializing than making any money. She ain't getting any of my tip money tonight. Then she brought me tacos, not the enchiladas I ordered. Never asked me what size beer I wanted. Then disappeared and didnt come back till I was done eating. Nope. Get rid of this one. Tuesday 6/21.

Scott G.,"Holly Springs, MS",155,50,8,2.0,1/21/2016,"This particular place makes me think that Chili's as a chain is on the way out. If they don't care any more than to have their restaurants run this way, then they are in trouble. The lady who served us was nice enough, but slow and this was during a lull in restaurant business. When I asked her for a couple more minutes to look, that couple of minutes took about 7, while she talked to a table of young ladies behind us about who they know, high school friends, etc...the food took quite some time to get there and only half of mine showed up. I got my grilled chicken sandwich, but the skillet mashed potatoes arrived after I got done eating it. I had one glass of water and wasn't asked if I wanted a refill.

Holly T.,"Pensacola, FL",0,3,,1.0,6/5/2016,"This has to be the nastiest Chili's I have ever been in! I wouldn't want my dog to even eat in here! It is so unbelievably dirty! We were traveling and stopped bc it looked new and clean from the outside. When we walked in, I told the hostess there were two in our party, she pointed to the bar area and said ""you just want to grab a booth over there?"" So we did! I would like to state, the place was empty, there may have been 10 guests total in the whole place. We sat down and the table was covered with food! We had to ask for the table to be cleaned, and that just made our waitress mad, she did not want to clean the table. I went to the restroom and it was even dirtier than the restaurant! Urine all over the toilets and floor, toilet paper every where, it was nasty! Besides being dirty, we witnessed two older women come in and be seated and never got waited on, they eventually got up and left. Before leaving one of the ladies stood at the front forever waiting to tell someone that they were leaving bc no one waited on them. Don't know where the hostess was, the lady ended up talking to a server that just happened to walk by! We should have known this place was a bust when we pulled up and all the servers were outside smoking! Whoever owns this place should do a loyalty check on their employees! I would be ashamed!

When we got our food, it didn't get any better.  The guacamole was bland and the vegetables & pork carnitas for fajitas were over-cooked and under-seasoned. The original ribs seemed boiled rather than ""slow-smoked"" as advertised, and the BBQ sauce tasted like ketchup.  Having eaten these items at other Chili's locations, and having been satisfied then, we knew this food wasn't consistent with the Chili's brand standard.

We went into the bar area and stood for 10 minutes without anyone acknowledging us. Finally I asked a waiter to clean off a table so we could be seated (there was only one available). His response was far from customer friendly. He said they were working to clean the tables and would get to it as they can. He stood and chatted with some locals, took away a few glasses for some customers and walked past me 3 times.) He finally wiped the table down and told me ""it's clean"". The seats had crumbs all over them and the floor was filthy. When I said what about the seats he seemed frustrated I didn't just sit in the crumbs and bent over to wipe them down. I could only imagine if I'd asked him to clean the floor I the booth. At that time I told him don't worry about it and left. I was disgusted at the poor customer service and his nasty attitude.
