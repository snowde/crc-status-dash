Chris W.,"Tyler, TX",0,12,3,1.0,12/29/2017,"Zero stars not possible, one star not deserved.  6:15 pm on a Friday evening, we decided to take advantage of our free queso offer, and dine at our local Chili's. We had not been here in a very long time due to underwhelming service and fare, but decided to give it another shot and try the new menu. The entire experience was nightmarish in nature.  Of all of the open spots where we could've been seated, we truly were in the worst place in the entire restaurant.  It was a dinky little booth, tucked in a corner next to a large booth full of diners, staring at a wall, and able to observe the server station and filth that was present. Please note the pictures I've shared.  I could have taken a photo anyplace in the establishment and captured similar filth.  Disgusting doesn't begin to describe it. Our sever attempted to be helpful but ultimately fell short by taking forever on our drink order and neglecting a request for small plates for our queso. The little plates were unnecessary anyway because, as you can see, the gelatinous mass of watery fake cheese dip with scary green guacamole, was inedible! Again, note the picture I've shared. Our entrees were marginal, at best, my husband eating less than half of his meal. Our lesson has been learned. We will never, I repeat NEVER, dine at the Tyler, TX Chili's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tyler
Lake A.,"Burleson, TX",0,4,2,5.0,12/12/2017,Lady at the Togo was so sweet! She honestly made my day. Food was quick and inexpensive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tyler
Emily M.,"Grand Prairie, TX",24,120,88,1.0,8/22/2016,"This place is a shit show.  Hostess was on her phone and ignored us for a good few mins.We were sat aling with 4 other tables.  Sat for 29 mins then watched as the waiter helped a table that was just sat instead of us.   We got up and left.  Place was filthy,  service is a joke.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tyler
Randy T.,"Plano, TX",3,20,,1.0,8/16/2017,"Stopped by to eat dinner.  Empty tables everywhere but was told the wait would be 20-25 minutes.  Asked why I couldn't sit an one of the many empty tables and was told, I'm sorry but you'll have to wait.  I'm not saying there was one or two random tables available, there were sections nearly empty.   Very disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tyler
Beverly A.,"Visalia, CA",0,10,4,4.0,8/18/2017,"Everything was excellent! Our server Michael was very polite and fast! We didn't have to ask for anything. With exception that my daughters steak was a little too rare, which that always varies from 1 place to another, Michael took it back and the put it back on the grill for a bit then it was perfect. We will definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tyler
Jennifer B.,"Tyler, TX",41,2,9,5.0,10/21/2017,Good food. We had a great waiter. Me and my husband had the honey chipotle chicken crispers. My mother in law had the dry rub ribs. Those are delicious. We all had the street corn on the cob also delicious. Over all great experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tyler
Celeste C.,"Tyler, TX",3,22,11,3.0,11/2/2016,"Had the 3 for me meal for $10. Chips and salsa, Carnitas fajitas and molten chocolate cake. Chips and salsa had a weird after taste but the fajitas were good. Love the cake! One of my children had pizza., the other had chicken strips. Not sure how they fry them or what type of batter they use but......, never again. It was puffy not crispy like a normal chicken strip., weird. My child didn't even eat them. But the pizza was fine. Overall my family just wanted a quick bite so we just stopped by. Doubt we would stop by again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tyler
Aaron S.,"Tyler, TX",0,4,1,1.0,7/2/2017,"We ordered chicken crispers and the breading was soggy and cold, otherwise known as undercooked. We complained about that and they said they would discount it 50 percent.       They discounted as stated but then added two sweet teas to our ticket that we did not order which was the exact amount of the discount. Total BS.  The manager removed the extra charge but acted annoyed by us. So watch these restaurants they will rip you off the first chance they get",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tyler
Brett B.,"Dallas, TX",5,5,1,1.0,7/27/2016,If I could post the pictures I would. Mold growing over the salt shakers. Got here at 11:15 a.m for lunch didn't get our food for 50 minutes and then broccoli was not cooked salmon over cooked shrimp under cooked and it looked like a 3 year old put the food on the plate. Never again will I ever come here,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tyler
Todd S.,"Tyler, TX",58,298,211,3.0,10/20/2011,"Always consistent. Always good. The service is always top-notch. The only reason to give 3 stars rather than 4 is because it's a national chain.  Unimpressive draft beer selection, but enough TV's to enjoy a game.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tyler
Michael B.,"Tyler, TX",48,49,42,3.0,7/10/2015,Picked up a to-go order.  It was the first time anyone at Chili's has ever taken the food out of the bag to show me that it was all there and all correct.  The girl who helped me was very nice.  The chips were hot and fresh but the salsa was too watery (and not at all hot).,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tyler
Connie M.,"Tyler, TX",0,3,,2.0,8/12/2015,Ate there yesterday around 3 PM in a party of three.  All ordered from the Express Lunch.  Two tables were seated after us and left before we even got our food. I ordered Enchilada soup and was served Potato Soup at room temperature.  Was told they wouldn't charge for the Potato Soup.  Kind of funny because I ordered the Bottomless soup and salad. The other 2 guest's orders were served at room temperature.  Was never asked if I wanted a refill.  Drinks weren't refilled until we were ready to leave. After we paid the bill we were asked if we wanted dessert. Is staffing that bad in the middle of the afternoon that neither the service nor the food is tolerable that time of day?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tyler
Jay K.,"Tyler, TX",0,1,,1.0,5/26/2016,Cant say much about the food as we arrived we here we were never seated we walked into the store about 2pm waited for a host but none ever came we did see several waiters just look at us like a deer  in the headlights we waited for around 10 min then decided to just leave as apprently we were not welcomed there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tyler
Stacy D.,"Athens, TX",0,1,,1.0,3/8/2016,"This happened in February 2016-Worse experience EVER! We took our out of town guests to lunch and received the worse service I have ever experienced at a restaurant.  1. There was no host or hostess when we entered the restaurant and a sign that said ""Please wait to be seated.""  So naturally we start looking for any staff that works there and if the restaurant is packed; it was not. I looked at my guests and ask if they want to eat somewhere else and they said no. The hostess who finally came over never acknowledge us during our wait by saying, ""I will be right with you,"" make eye contact, or a simple hand gesture.  2. The waitress who took our order was nice, but seemed to take longer than usual with our drinks. She finally took our order for the appetizers and main dishes and was gone for quite awhile. Finally, she brought us refills and our two appetizers with small plates for everyone. The first two small plates were dry the rest were still wet and still had food on them. Could not find the waitress to send the small plates back. We decided to divide the two appetizers on their original plates and share them that way. 3. The main dishes arrive. My steak and another's were well done when we clearly ordered them to be medium rare. Waitress took them back. Another 30+ minutes and the steaks arrive and are perfect. By then we were ready to go and asked for to-go boxes.  Our kids were grumpy, fussy, and tired after being there for that long.   NEVER AGAIN!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tyler
Danny B.,"Tyler, TX",289,129,25,1.0,4/11/2014,Service here was terribly slow. Kept having to flag down waitstaff to get service. Food took forever to arrive and they were not that busy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tyler
Shack S.,"Whitehouse, TX",14,2,,1.0,11/1/2015,If I could only give zero stars this is awful place   this should be closed by health inspector. I'm not the only one you hates this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tyler
Elizabeth J.,"Houston, TX",5,85,7,3.0,3/28/2015,"C'mon yall. It's a Chilis and they are all about the same, as most chains! Decent food.. Typically get a big salad or some chicken crispers tacos and never had a problem with our to go orders.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tyler
K T.,"Tyler, TX",0,9,1,5.0,9/3/2015,"Had a great meal on Father's Day. New tacos were good and spicy. Service was awesome and timely, Connor should be commended. I understand there was an equipment problem in the kitchen but it never showed in our experience. Momma loves the Tropical Sunrise Margarita.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tyler
Amanda K.,"Tyler, TX",67,17,,1.0,5/10/2015,"The fried pickles were disgusting.  So much salt - inedible.  The hot sauce was so watered down, we couldn't dip it with a chip.  When our food arrived, they forgot our daughters meal. We had to wait for it to be prepared.  Nothing was comp'ed.  Just apologies.  Won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tyler
Wesley D.,"Tyler, TX",1,5,,2.0,1/18/2014,"Come in for lunch around 12:45 on Saturday. Was greeted at my car by a very friendly lady telling us that their transformer blew so they have no power.  So I get a coupon for free chips and queso, which expired 12/31/13....thanks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tyler?start=20
Joe N.,"Flint, TX",2,298,28,4.0,7/28/2010,"Wow just WOW. Typically we avoid these chains like the plague cause they over priced, the service is horrible and you leave feeling nasty, broke and unsatisfied. NOT TRUE HERE! I think we saw 5 or 6 servers during our dinner, bringing different items including our meal. They were so nice and attentive but not up our grill. It was like they telepathically knew when I needed a new drink as I was thinking it. They weren't too pushy they were always nice, trying to get everyone to buy up the menu.  The food was cooked perfectly. My little niece actually ate an entire big mouth burger. My wife and I had the sirloin steak, with the most amazing seasoning, and the loaded taters were to die for!  Yes...I said...taters... lol fast service, friendly servers, good food... not much more to ask for! Good job, ladies keep up the good work, and the tips will fall like rain.  Like I always say keep the girls fresh & nice, the beer cold, the steaks rare and the oysters raw, you'll never go wrong!!!!   Anyways go forth and enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tyler?start=20
Clinton S.,"Tyler, TX",5,16,3,2.0,1/3/2013,why even bother asking how i would like my burger cooked??  it seems that either the expo cook has no idea how to cook a burger any other way except well done or he just doesn't care.  on MANY occasions i've tried ordering my burger medium rare only to see it come to my table looking like a hockey puck. as a long time patron i'm extremely disappointed that they just can't seem to do this right.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tyler?start=20
Chowderbug W.,"Plano, TX",0,7,,2.0,1/4/2014,"I'm not a huge fan of chili's in the first place but this is where my friends wanted to go so we did. The food was its normal blah tasteless food but the service was horrible. Our waitress takes our drink order and a friend asked for tea in a large to go cut with extra ice. She comes back with a child's small sippy cup size tea. My friend said to her oh can I get that in a large cup and the waitress snapped back, oh we'll we can only give those out if you specifically ask for it. My friend says well I'm specifically asking for one knowing that she asked for one the first time. I order a margarita and she asks for my ID. I start giggling because I look really young and still get carded for r-rated movies. She goes into this long story of how they have to ask because they have secret shoppers and if they are caught not asking they get fired, ok that's fine, I don't mind. After she brought our food out we literally saw her 2 times. We sat there for 10 minutes waiting for refills on our drinks. While we were still eating she brings the check and slaps it on the table and says whenever you're ready. The whole experience was unpleasant, she was short, rude, rushed, and disappeared for long periods of time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tyler?start=20
Summer C.,"Tyler, TX",164,6,,1.0,8/19/2014,"I used to love this place and the food. I was there a couple weeks ago and decided to sit at the bar. I brought a couple of my coworkers in with me after we had finished my shift. There was 4 seats available but a lady was in the middle of some of them. I politely asked if she mind moving down one she rolled her eyes at me and moved anyways. She ended up telling the bartender that I cursed at her and told her "" to move the f**k down. I most certainly did not. Then I learned later that she called back said the same thing but said the bartender had was laughing at the event and she got kicked out of the bar. But the reason I will never go back is that the manager didn't give her the benefit of the doubt. This girl lied on both of us for absolutely no reason! For her to get kicked out of the bar was ridiculous. On that note u lost myself and about a dozen or more customers. I would like to give u a zero but I guess one has to do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tyler?start=20
