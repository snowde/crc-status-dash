Brad P.,"Chicago, IL",30,17,2,5.0,10/11/2017,"My truck broke done in Georgia and I stayed in a hotel for a few nights. I went to chili's to watch the Cubs gam, have a few drinks and some food. I had a blast there. The bartender was great and the drinks were awesome. I had the fajitas for dinner and it was really good. I definitely would be back here if I'm in Valdosta again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valdosta
Erik B.,"Valdosta, GA",0,2,,1.0,12/27/2017,"My family and I have gone to this Valdosta location ever since it opened. No longer! This last visit has ended my hopes that it could pull out of the downward spiral that is destroying a once enjoyable restaurant. I've noticed the decline starting two visits ago, but tonight was horrible!  It was prime dinner time, and only half full, so the wait staff/kitchen was not busy, and yet we waited 10 minutes to have our order taken.  When the food arrived, not everything showed. We asked the waitress for our salads, and she apologized and said she'd be right back...so we proceeded to eat chicken that was only breading, and vegetables that were not seasoned, and everything just thrown on a plate with no attempt at presentation! I've ordered basically the same meal at KFC for a third the cost, and it was amazing, and then there's this pitiful show...  As we were trying to make it to a movie, we went ahead and ate, and dealt with it. A non-professional manager walked by as we have a mouthful, taps the table with ""Y'all doing okay here? Good."" And keeps walking without waiting for an answer.  The waitress brings a drink refill, and I ask for our salads, and she acts surprised and goes back to get them.  We don't see her again, until I chase her down for a refill, and remind her that we still haven't gotten our salads. She comes back with drinks, and explains that the ""salad person"" forgot, but that it'd be just a minute... We finish eating ten minutes later, and there's still no sign of our waitress, so I try to find her to let her know to forget the salads, and just bring the check. We get a full cost check, and a non-concerned apology, and left with a set determination to never come back. I could understand/forgive the service, and quality of the food, if they had been swamped, and had made an effort to make things right.  But when you see staff hanging out, talking and joking, you know that it's just a lack of care for the customers.  I'm realistic, and understand that sometimes a member of the staff has a bad night...I don't flip out, and if it's a place I've had good experiences with in the past, I'll give them another chance. But when EVERY aspect of a visit is substandard; inattentive waitress, poor quality food/presentation, unprofessional/insincere manager, and a ""salad person"" who takes half an hour to make two side salads...never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valdosta
Kevin Y.,"Flowery Branch, GA",207,458,966,4.0,6/4/2017,"First time to this Chilis in Valdosta as it was close to my daughters house and I was craving Chilis. Was pleasantly surprised. Good crowd, the bar wasn't very full so sat at the bar and got a cold beer while deciding what to get. Bartender was Christina who was attentive, great service and made me feel comfortable and welcome.  Decided on the Shrimp and chicken fajitas which came out relatively quick, hot and good flavor. Plenty of tortillas , had everything I needed for the entire meal.  Christina kept me with cold beer and the shrimp was good size an chicken was perfectly cooked. Watched a game while I ate and enjoyed it. For the area, Ill be back or get chilis to go which is often a great choice to get when you want to chill at home with the kids.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valdosta
Elijah R.,"Valdosta, GA",80,15,9,4.0,7/28/2017,Excellent service!! Sheldy was very helpful. The food is good too! I got the slider hamburgers and they were delicious.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valdosta
Tracy W.,"Greenwich, OH",10,74,42,2.0,5/9/2016,"Been to Chili's numerous times across the country. First time at this location in Valdosta.  Since it was a nice evening I sat outside on the patio. I was the only one out there so I immediately wondered how the service would be. I guess my hunch was correct. Took a while for the server to come just to take my drink order. They had a special on a half rack of ribs with house fries, salad, and chocolate molten desert all for $10.99. Too good to pass this up. I have had Chili's ribs before, and I must say these were not the best but just OK. The fries were good and fresh. Salad was good, but the ranch dressing was definitely water down. The mini chocolate molten cake was also just OK as I could tell it was just microwaved part of it was hot and part of it was cold. Each time the waiter brought out some of my food, he always apologize for the wait. Never did get a drink refill for my water. I travel quite a bit and I must say I usually stay away from chain restaurants just because I like the local places. Usually better food and better service at the local restaurants. Coming back to Chili's I was reminded of that. I'm staying in town for six days, and will not be back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valdosta
Elle R.,"Tampa, FL",14,9,1,2.0,12/7/2016,Food was good but the service was terrible. Received only part of my order and never saw the waitress again the rest of the visit. Had to flag down another person for help.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valdosta
Melissa P.,"Nashville, TN",101,8,,5.0,9/10/2016,"We stopped by on our way home to Nashville, and we enjoyed everything about our visit. Janna is an exceptional waitress! She is so kind, always smiling, and very attentive to our table. Thank you for the amazing customer service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valdosta
Lance B.,"Valdosta, GA",47,33,38,4.0,4/3/2016,Great for Saturday lunch. The southern smokehouse burger is delicious. I would highly recommend it!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valdosta
Katy K.,"Wheatland, CA",0,7,,2.0,6/3/2016,"My husband and I travel all over the country, and Chili's is one of those restaurants that we frequently go to since it's usually pretty consistent. This one was below par, and I'll be looking for other ones in the area if I ever get another craving for Chilis. The queso dip is always our go to appetizer- but I'm not sure what it was that they gave us.. not queso, not appetizing. It tasted old and not anything close to what we were used to. My husband even made the comment that the salsa didn't taste right.  As for dinner I decided to try something I hadn't had before, the grilled chicken salad. It had potential to be good, if they weren't so proud of the dressing they put on it. One bite and the dressing was oozing out of my mouth and dripping back onto the plate.. no thank you.  I might as well add, there seemed to be drama among the wait-staff. It just made for an environment that we won't be coming back to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valdosta
Mishay A.,"Valdosta, GA",3,13,,5.0,4/2/2016,"I come to this location all the time. Probably too much but I love Chili's!! Usually, the service is pretty good. Very few mistakes and they always try to make it right. I'm that customer that's always making request and they always put up with me. Sarah was my waitress today and she was excellent and took care of everything. She was very friendly. I hope to get her again. As usual I will be back for my south western egg rolls!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valdosta
Gina G.,"Frisco, TX",0,3,,5.0,11/8/2016,"Driving through and had my Chili's fix, it was awesome!  Great food and service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valdosta
Meaghan B.,"Valdosta, GA",7,19,8,1.0,6/9/2015,"I got the margarita fresh mex bowl to go. Terrible idea. They usually put the dressing on the side but this time it was already on it which I didn't like & there was almost no lettuce so basically I just paid $10 for rice and beans.... I do not recommend getting anything from anywhere in Valdosta to go because they usually screw it up, making you either go back and get it fixed or to just keep the screwed up meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valdosta
Eddie N.,"Atlanta, GA",33,6,,3.0,6/7/2016,Good food. Was told that this store does not participate in the email rewards. I could not cash in any points or earn any points. Next time I will probably next door to Applebees or Olive garden.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valdosta
MaryEllen S.,"Dawson, GA",0,3,,1.0,2/6/2016,"The service was horrible!!!  The waiter never came back to see how the food was.  After a long wait, we had to ask for the bill. No one came to take the payment.  The food was mediocre at best. The guacamole was brown, clearly oxidized. We never saw the waiter again. The ladies room was a mess, a soap dispenser was missing, the one that was there was placed so high, that children could not reach it.   All in all it was a very unpleasant experience.  I gave it 1 star because 0 was not an option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valdosta
Darla D.,"Valdosta, GA",3,27,35,5.0,7/18/2014,Great place to go! I come to Chili's at least once a week and they are always great. Our server was great and friendly. The atmosphere was nice as well! They have a full bar and an outside place to eat. Chili's is a great place and you will definitely want to come back to this one!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valdosta
Dawn W.,"Valdosta, GA",0,2,,2.0,12/21/2015,"This place used to be a good chili's not so much anymore. They are so worried about their food cost they will not give you any extra dressing for your salad, they don't even fill the bowls of food up if you get one of their soups the bowls is not even half filled up. They were out of kid menus. Supposedly they got a new gm and that is why they are cutting down on their food cost. We used to go a couple of times a month but not anymore. I will not pay $4.49 for have a bowl of soup!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valdosta
Ashley M.,"Valdosta, GA",169,295,373,4.0,9/21/2014,"Best chips and salsa anywhere!  Fajitas, mushroom Swiss burger, chicken quesadilla, shrimp tacos, and plenty more.  Pretty good top shelf margarita.  This location can get very crowded, I have had to wait a few times, service is pretty reliable once seated. Great place to order to go, order more chips than u think, they will get eaten :) Seems to be where we always eat before the movies as it is located in front of the theatre.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valdosta
Tanja M.,"North Charleston, SC",51,80,158,5.0,8/29/2013,Well as you can see I do come to Chilis quite a bit. I have never had a bad service here. All the food that I have had tasted good. The staff is normally really friendly and quick at getting you your food/drinks. On a nice day I like to sit out on the outside patio. I will be back again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valdosta
Chelsea B.,"Daytona Beach Shores, FL",0,4,,1.0,6/13/2015,"Worst Chili's I have ever been to and I have been to many. My cup was DIRTY and smelled like dog poo. My favorite dish, the Cajun Chicken Pasta, just was not good. Service wasn't too bad. But I've been disappointed with this location on multiple occasions. Will not be going back again, that's for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valdosta
Julie B.,"Valdosta, GA",55,42,1,5.0,9/26/2010,"Ahh, Chili's.  There's one in every town, and it's a perfect haven for the indecisive.  Someone's craving Mexican, someone else is craving a steak, and yet another person just wants a salad...Chili's is the place to go.  But how does such a predictable, large chain get a five-star rating, you may ask?  Killer service.  For real.  My tea glass never goes empty, the servers always have recommendations of delicious food when I am simply incapable of making up my mind, and sometimes, they find a way to simply go above and beyond. I won't be naming names, because I've gotten in trouble for the same sort of awesome service at previous jobs (""You can't do that!  It's not on the menu/corporate approved/you didn't complete corporate training for that!""), but here we go. I ordered the fried shrimp, hoping to eat them with some delicious cocktail sauce.  I don't think I've seen a restaurant that serves fried shrimp but doesn't offer cocktail or tartar sauce.  When my food arrived, I asked for cocktail sauce, and was informed that Chili's doesn't stock it.  POOP.  I racked my brain, trying to decide what they have that might be good on shrimp.  Ranch?  BBQ sauce?  Honey mustard?  Ketchup?  While my brain was spinning its wheels, my server said ""Hang on a sec.""  Two minutes later, there was a bowl of freshly-made cocktail sauce on my table.  Spicy, horseradish-y, sweet, blessed cocktail sauce. This, my dears, is how you get a $13 tip from my husband and I. Keep it up, Awesome Chili's Server.  You totally made my night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valdosta
Sarah H.,"Orlando, FL",124,215,5,4.0,3/30/2011,"Perfect for any budget, appetite or craving. They offer a little bit of everything from steaks and burgers to fish and mexican. Gotta love their happy hour 2 for 1 margaritas (sucks that it has to be at the bar tho). They're open later than most restaurants which is a plus. My husband and I decided on dessert and drinks before a movie one night and we had a good time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valdosta?start=20
Morgan C.,"Valdosta, GA",16,37,11,1.0,6/4/2011,"The only good thing about Chili's are the $1.99 all day Margaritas. Otherwise the food is DISGUSTING! Don't waste your money on this Americanized excuse for ""southwest"" cuisine. I'd rather go to Taco Bell!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valdosta?start=20
