Dustin J.,"Riverview, FL",7,22,13,5.0,8/9/2017,Great place to eat. The molten chocolate cake is out standing. Family enjoys every time we go here to eat,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valrico
Matt J.,"Tampa, FL",0,90,1,2.0,3/17/2017,"Usually avoid chains but was given a gift card so why not go have a free dinner.  Over all totally average and what you'd expect.  I had the three app combo with sliders and what was on the menu as ""chicken crispers"" and what came out looked nothing like the crispers in the picture on the menu.   These were more of a batter like you'd get with  sweet and sour chicken.   Not crispy at all.   Not sure what's going on there. My wife got the cheese enchellada (spelling?) and liked it alot.  The highlight of the night was the taller male bartender who was quick to refill drinks.     Subtracted one star because the men's room was extremely dirty and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valrico
James P.,"Apollo Beach, FL",67,459,57,3.0,5/24/2015,"Chili's is fine, whatever.  Chain fast casual that does everything safe and nothing special at all, but because it's super corporate everyone is required to be friendly even though my fat son shrieks like a Golden Eagle descending on its prey.  So that's a definite plus. I usually do the 2 for $20 menu, which snags a small appetizer and two full entrees from a limited menu.  It's almost always fajitas and ribs, which are always cooked well enough.  It's exactly as expected, every time.  I guess it's good that they're consistent, but if you're bringing a date here, you're boring.  And a terrible decision maker for restaurants, since this place is always packed with kids (Fishhawk, amirite?).   They do have those Ziosk things at every table though, so you can order drinks without having to flag anyone down.  The Ziosks also have games if your smartphone (or the conversation) dies, and you can even pay and get your receipt from them.  Best part, though, is that the signature box accepts any input, so you can draw a cat as your official credit card sig.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valrico

I.H. R.,"Port Charlotte, FL",0,19,,1.0,6/11/2017,Sunday at 11:30 AM.  Seated quickly. Service OK. Kitchen slow. Ordered a Ultimate bacon burger (everything has honey chipotle sauce added to disguise the crap ingredients).

Britt B.,"Brandon, FL",319,37,16,5.0,8/31/2016,This Chili's has really improved in the last year because it is under new management.  The best time to go is on a night when Brittany is bartending!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valrico
Leighanna B.,"Riverview, FL",0,2,,4.0,8/31/2017,We were there for dinner had some great food but the service was extremely slow could be better. What I mean by slow got a free drink out of it because she forgot to order it I was already done eating by the time she wanted to bring it. Then we were paying with cash we had to ask for another waiter because she never came back to the table.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valrico
Chelsea P.,"Lithia, FL",81,50,6,2.0,5/20/2017,"First time at this location, most likely will not return. Visited at 8pm on a Saturday night and the location was not too terribly busy, surprisingly the host and manager at the host stand did not greet upon entering the restaurant nor after the 2 minutes of us standing there waiting. That's fine, however they could also not agree on how long it would be for a wait time for a party of two, the host said 30 minutes while the manager quoted 15. After sitting for about 5 minutes the manager brought us to a table because she informed us that another table whose named she called did not answer the page. We were greeted by our server Candy promptly, which is the why one of the stars was awarded. I ordered one of the seasonal watermelon margaritas with sugar on the rim, and was told oh yes no problem the drink comes with sugar on the rim anyways. When the drink was brought to the table, there was nothing on the rim. No worries, bartender must have been busy, the drink was delicious anyways. We ordered the skillet queso and apparently Chili's has changed their portion size because there was hardly any queso in the skillet. Onto the entrees, I substituted broccoli for corn on the cob, and of course the entree came out with broccoli, the server brought out corn on the cob, after my boyfriend kindly reminded her of the request when we ordered. The food, other than the queso being small, tasted great which is why the second star was awarded. While leaving the manager and host were again by the door and no 'thanks for visiting' or anything was said. This location needs some work on making their guests feel welcome and ensuring a quality experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valrico
Brian H.,"Hickam AFB, HI",1,7,2,4.0,1/5/2017,"Great Experience, made a ""Call Ahead"" reservation online and came into a full lobby thinking we would have to wait and we were seated immediately. Waitress was nice and attentive. The only reason it's not a 5 was because our appetizer was cold and the chips were broken into little pieces",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valrico
Stacia H.,"Brandon, FL",0,4,,2.0,12/28/2016,"Ate in the bar but had to wait on a table to be cleaned. No big deal, but only 2 waitresses and they were too busy to stop and clean it.  After waiting awhile I said something and the poor waitress face was so stressed I felt bad! Hire some bus boys!! My burger was dry and had no taste! Couldn't wait to leave! We tipped the stressed waitress well!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valrico
Mavin S.,"Lithia, FL",0,4,1,3.0,12/18/2015,"Best of breed for the area, but get some friggin' WIFI in this place, seriously.  Love the margaritas and some of the food. The staff tries hard, but most are still rookies at customer service.  Convenient location too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valrico
Letitia K.,"Riverview, FL",4,31,32,4.0,8/10/2015,The food is always good. Service is hit or miss. This time we ordered onion rings they were good but the plate they served them on was chipped & broken on the ends. A little worried about when it got chipped looked on plate & didn't see any glass chips in our food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valrico
Jamie W.,"Byron, GA",313,348,527,4.0,2/25/2014,The service from the staff was excellent first time coming to this Chilli's Bar & Grill here in the Lithia/Valrico area. Our dinner entrees and drinks were most delicious and yummy. The dark chicken fajitas were delicious as my mother and sister described to me as I am writing this to my review. I had a plain hamburger and french fries the hamburger was cooked just right and no pink inside!  Only bad thing I can say they leave the air conditioner on freezing!!! But the manager listened and turned the air conditioner up higher so everyone can be warm.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valrico
Dan C.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",13,3,,1.0,9/26/2015,"Don't be cattle...  Terrible service.  Poorly run.  Food comes late, cold, or wrong.  Servers disappears for way too long.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valrico
Stephanie M.,"Brandon, FL",0,27,38,3.0,1/22/2016,Waitress was okay. It was busy so I will give her the benefit of the doubt on her service. Had the new loaded buffalo boneless chicken wings. They were okay. Loved the strawberry patron margaritas!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valrico
Jason H.,"Chicago, IL",104,361,3,2.0,2/15/2013,"It gets two stars because the afternoon wasn't a total bust...but it was close. Had a party of eight for some family birthdays.  We weren't given menus before or after everyone arrived -- one of us had to walk over and take them from the stand.  Our server was kind, but she seemed to disappear for long lengths of time.  We started with four appetizers which took a hell of a long time - confusing because it was not even half full.  Our meals arrived in a very fragmented fashion as well - not like two minutes apart, I mean that some of us waited 10 minutes to get our food after some of it was served. At this point the manager came over and apologized and comped two of our appetizers.  The vibe I got was that there was some kind of kitchen issue, but why couldn't our server have communicated that?  She later apologized about the menus, stating that servers are supposed to give everyone menus when they seat people (we had been seated by another server, not a host).  I found this to be immature -- don't make excuses, just apologize and move on. I think the most surprising thing about this day was the food. It just wasn't that good.  I haven't been eating at chains a lot since I came to Florida but I have always been a Chili's fan...hopefully this is just a bad location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valrico
Perry G.,"Riverview, FL",0,22,6,4.0,1/3/2016,I ordered online and picked up at the exact time it said it would be ready about 30 minutes. No one came out to my car as I had asked so I went right in but customer service was very friendly. Food was amazing love how they kept some things in a bag with instructions on how to heat it up. Overall was a nice affordable lunch! Will return,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valrico
John L.,"Brandon, FL",0,5,1,1.0,1/2/2016,"Have been to many different ""Chili's"" locations but this is the most disappointing ever. Slow and poor explanations for it.

Michael S.,"Brandon, FL",0,4,,2.0,12/8/2012,"Something has happened at Chili's and it is not a good thing.  I have been a loyal Chili's customer for years at locations all around the country.  I always considered them the best of the bunch when compared to TGIF, Applebee's, etc.  I still love their chips, queso and salsa but something about their overall food quality has changed.  My wife and I love their chocolate mountain lava cake thing but the last two times we ordered it there was a staleness quality about it.  Just not as fresh.  Another item that seems to have deteriorated are the fajitas.  I have had the fajitas dozens and dozens of times over the years so I know what I am talking about.  Fajitas must be cooked and served right off the grill but the last two times I had them it was like they had been sitting around and reheated, yuck!  They are doing something different in the kitchen probably driven by corporate bean counters to cut cost at the expense of quality but what they are going to ultimately do is drive away customers like me and fall back into the pack of mediocrity.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valrico?start=40

Mario C.,"Lithia, Tampa Bay, FL",28,59,43,4.0,9/29/2013,"Ok, I now Chillis is a chain restaurant but they have several items on their menu that are simply the best. In my humble opinion, no one does a better job with these dishes than chillies: 1) chips and salsa - their salsa is amazing and I love their ultra thin tortilla chips  2) steak fajita nachos: refried beans, melted cheese, steak and jalapeños all prepared individually on tortilla chips 3) steak fajitas: their steak is very well marinated and flavorful, cooked to perfection Try these items on your next visit, you won't be disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valrico?start=20
Luke B.,"Tampa, FL",48,4,2,3.0,8/2/2015,"It's a Chili's. You know what you're getting food-wise. I'd say four star flavor for a chain. Those chicken crispers are good! Kids meals are $5 and they also have a touch screen tablet at each table that has games on it (for $1 fee). There are usually coupons around, too. This location could could use a really good scrub down. The service is adequate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valrico?start=20
Kendra M.,"Riverview, FL",1,20,,1.0,7/22/2015,"Terrible experience here on Tuesday. Came with a group of about 7 people. Took 45 mins before we even got our drinks. One of my friends drinks(water) had a bug in it, when he told our waiter all the waiter did was say yup and took it to get replaced... No apology, nothing. I didn't order food because I felt like he would've taken an hour to bring it and I had to leave. My friends stayed to drink but everyone was very disappointed at his service. Not coming back to this location for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valrico?start=20
Cathie D.,"Tampa, FL",112,171,3,2.0,4/25/2013,"I am normally a big fan of Chili's & have been to this location several times.  Not sure what has happened since we last visited, but we won't be returning to this location.  The location on Highway 60 near Brandon mall is probably closer & we will go there from now on!  We sat in the bar on a Sunday evening around 7:45 pm.  Service was slow & she was very unfriendly.  There was another server that was working the bar area, but she was only focused on cleaning up tables.  The bartender seemed more concerned about holding a conversation with the only patron sitting at the bar.  The food was mediocre.  My husband had the trio fajitas & I had the chicken/bacon quesadillas.  Neither was great.  The place was not crowded at all when we arrived & we confirmed that they were open until 10pm.  Not sure if they were short staffed or what, but we had noticed a decline in this location the last time we visited as well.

Bryce F.,"Tampa, FL",30,4,2,1.0,3/6/2015,"My girlfriend and I had placed an order online for pickup. Not only was the host and hostess rude and did not acknowledge us, but they did not receive our order. Instead of offering to make it at their current restaurant, they told us to drive across town to the other chilis.

Jay C.,"Lutz, FL",9,4,1,1.0,2/7/2015,Not ready for business much less not accommodating to a large party. We came in with our Boys Lacrosse team and they acted like it was an inconvenience.

Nick C.,"Brandon, Tampa Bay, FL",46,37,3,1.0,6/28/2014,"Bar smelled of old beer and spilled drinks like it hadn't been cleaned in a while. There were more fruit flies than bar guests . Bartender was not very friendly to me or other bar guest but as soon as a regular walked in she spent all of her time taking care of him. A business an not survive on its current clientile alone, you have to bring in new guests and make them feel welsome...this is not how. Food is average bar food, but it could have been great and I would have rated it one star.

Alexandra K.,"Aurora, IL",104,7,2,1.0,9/16/2015,"Went in for lunch, it was not busy so it appeared they only had one server but it took forever for us to get seated. We didn't order anything complicated, just sandwiches with fries but considering that we went in during a slow time (there were maybe 3-4 tables seated total) our food took forever, and when it finally did come out our fries were cold and soggy. The server took forever to check back with us after our food arrived to see if everything was ok, so we actually had to get her attention. The bread on my chicken avocado sandwich was way over toasted and black and there was barely any avocado (1 tiny half slice), so the server did take it back so get a regular untoasted bun and our cold fries at my request. The sandwich was just ok once it finally came out on untoasted bread. But our fries were still cold.. For the second time! It was pretty clear that they just placed the fries under the heater or something because they were cold and soggy and they were super salty, we didn't end up eating them it was just gross! I'm honestly surprised after fries coming out cold twice that the server didn't offer something else or get a manager to come apologize since it was so slow. I know it's just a Chili's, but come on if you can't even get lunch right during slow parts of the day, how do you even manage to get anything right?! Definitely not coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valrico?start=20
Julie M.,"Valrico, FL",54,19,,1.0,6/2/2014,"The service in this establishment is horrendous. Unfortunately, I have given this location more than one chance to redeem it's self and have been disappointed every time.  The wait staff is friendly but pays little attention to the needs of their guest. This past visit(which will be my last) left our table with empty glasses, no silverware or napkins, and food that took over an hour to serve. When we tracked down another waiter to get us some plates he brought us 4 plates for a table of 7, two of which were dirty. I was given the wrong drink twice and then charged for both of them although they went untouched. 3/4 of the tables were empty so I'm not sure why the food would take so long and when it came out the meat was over cooked and greasy, there were a total of 8 fries on my plate. I was told more would be coming out but never saw them. While we sat waiting for our food we watched wait staff talk on their cell phones and play around at the tables. Friends of ours were also eating at this location at the same time as we were. They were seated in another section. When they came over to say goodbye, they told us without being prompted, that the service was horrible and that one of the ladies found a large bug in her food.  Not sure why the service at this location has continuously gotten worse of the last year or so, but I do know that I will NEVER return to this establishment and I will not recommend it to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-valrico?start=20
