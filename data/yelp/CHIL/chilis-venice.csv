Mike S.,"Tucson, AZ",1,40,4,4.0,11/25/2017,"This chili's is a great place that a lot of people from the town cone together at. Their service is pretty good. They have good prices like the 2 for 22 dollar meal deal. The food is always good. The location is good, easy to find and parking is very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-venice
John S.,"Washington, DC",70,22,,1.0,12/28/2017,Terrible food. I got food poisoning. John the waiter was a great guy but the food wound up causing me to wake at 2 am with severe diarrhea. Threw up on my flight home to dc. Avoid avoid avoid,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-venice
Linda D.,"Burbank, CA",0,5,,1.0,1/1/2018,"Walked in and sat at a bar table.  The place was filthy.  Table was sticky, restaurant smelled disgusting, menus needed cleaning.  It was just too dirty and discussing to even stay.  We walked out even before we could be greeted and we won't be back until they have new management ms the place is cleaned/renovated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-venice
K F.,"Colonial Heights, VA",0,14,1,1.0,6/22/2017,"We went there to pick up something quick from the Venice location car pickup. We have eaten inside several times and everything was great no complaints. This time we got the triple-dipper appetizer and the burgers were not fully cooked still pink inside, chicken wings were a lil warmer than room temp, and egg rolls were soggy. It was disgusting it went right in the trash. They have lost my business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-venice
J PAUL B.,"Placida, FL",0,45,24,2.0,4/5/2017,"Forget it! Ate here4/4/17 @approx6:00, funny thing hardly anyone there guess for a good reason. I ordered Carnitas tacos tasted like it was shoe leather softened up, rice was tasteless, overall warm except the plate it came on was hot. Wife ordered Chicken crisper dinner, fries were barely warm, chicken tuff, corn on cob cold.  Have eaten here numerous times this time was the pits. I usually only review with positive comments but not possible this time. Table next to us told waitress his chicken not cooked, she wanted to take it back as per mgr and told him the batter sometimes is a problem. Manager never showed face, some time later waitress gave him another order of chicken he took home as they were done with their dinner.  Maybe an off night or mgr needs to do job!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-venice
Michelle R.,"Fishkill, NY",36,15,1,2.0,6/20/2017,Went here this evening . We walked in got immediately seated the waitress introduced herself ordered our drinks she brought them over no problem ... she asked asked us what we wanted to eat . My dad is hard of hearing so she asked him do you want the chips or the salad he said ok she said NO YOU PICK ONE .. and have him an attitude he was like oh the salad sorry dear . She looked at me and she was annoyed and I just looked at her mean as hell . And she quick took the look off her face and got real nice real quick ... from then on she was fine ... my food came out ... there were 3 long hairs on it ... I choked it up and pulled it off and just didn't eat that section it was busy and it would of taken forever to get new food .. my mom asked for the oil and vinegar when she got it the bottle was filthy on the outside . It was repulsive honestly ...we were sitting at a booth and right behind my dads head was a bucket of DIRTY WATER. The waitresses kept ringing dirty towels in and kept cleaning the tables with . There were chunks of hair hanging off the side .. it was disgusting .. I love chilis normally but this location was HORRENDOUS ... shame on you chilis .. clean your act up and those pitchers of whatever were sitting there for over an hour . One waitress finally took whatever the liquid was and refilled someone's drink ...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-venice
Brian C.,"Venice, FL",0,21,4,4.0,3/13/2017,"Arrived for lunch, taking  some friends to the airport.  Restaurant  was busy but was promptly seated and waited on. Food was satisfying.  I would return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-venice
Jeffrey K.,"Venice, FL",1,12,1,1.0,12/16/2016,When did Chili's get to be such a crappy rip-off? $3.49 for chips and salsa; when actual Mexican restaurants give them free? Crappy dry Pork in the tacos. No bueno!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-venice
Cheryl M.,"Sarasota, FL",0,1,,1.0,7/7/2017,Waited to be seated (or even spoken to!) for nearly 10 minutes. Was acknowledged only by another customer. Can't rate anything else because our we left.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-venice
Adriana S.,"Sarasota, FL",0,20,6,3.0,10/4/2016,"I love the appetizers and desserts here. Texas cheese fries and southwest chicken rolls are amazing. Entrees are not great. Service is good, but the restaurant isn't clean at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-venice
Linda M.,"Port Charlotte, FL",0,20,,4.0,9/17/2015,"I stopped in at the bar and ordered a to go item. The bartender was new, David, and he remembered my name on the second visit. He was so good at his job and had the personality to go with it. I ordered wings with honey chipotle sauce, extra celery and extra blue cheese. I got a gigantic order of chicken and lots of sides. I was very happy with everything. There was too much sauce on the wings, but that's not so awful. All in all I wish I lived closer so I could go and hang at the bar not just get take out for me at the office. I recommend it highly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-venice
James L.,"Port St. Lucie, FL",0,20,,1.0,10/11/2016,"Our waitress was Kristina.  She was very rude and unhelpful while we ordered.  Our appetizer was delicious, but after we finished the plates sat in front of us until we paid.  As did a total of 5 empty glasses, there was only two of us dining!  She walked by empty handed numerous times.  Our dinner was served by another of the wait staff, they were very polite, but Kristina never checked to see if everything was alright.  Food wasn't too terrible, a little plain and didn't look like the picture.  Our table was so full of empty dishes it was uncomfortable enjoying the meal.   At the end we waited almost ten minutes to get a chocolate cake, but Kristina still hadn't been back, to clear plates, to ask how anything was, or if we needed anything else like dessert!  As we were struggling to pay with the computer on the table, I watched her walk by three times, we were obviously stressed and unable to make the buttons work, but she never stopped to ask if we needed assistance,   I had to literally stand up and step in front of her to receive help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-venice
Mama Mia S.,"Englewood, FL",3,131,,3.0,11/17/2015,"I do like the food here, but resent the fact that, like other chain restaurants, they have started using Automated Everything at your table, like a little computer. I hate it with a passion and just cannot get used to it. Why the restaurants do this is beyond me. The waitress has twice the work, trying to explain how everything works, then when that does not go through, she has to go and do it herself anyway, so what's gained???? I had the combo lunch for $8.00 and that was a good deal, but I will NOT BE GOING BACK., and that goes for any chain restaurants that install those ""robots""!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-venice
Angie P.,"Venice, FL",2,19,,5.0,2/23/2014,"I had a new Southwestern salad, a new menu item last night and i loved it.  It was light, refreshing, and perfect.  Approx 16-18 ww+ points.  Try it.  You will be glad you did.  Also, the presentation was beautiful!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-venice
Yana S.,"North Port, FL",96,97,51,4.0,2/19/2013,"Boss took us out to lunch here before. Food was really good, I ordered their Spinach and Artichoke Dip, and chicken Fajitas. I was a little disappointed when they told me part of the lunch menu is no longer available, yet they still presented it.. Their strawberry lemonade is really good too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-venice
J-830 H.,"Parker, CO",0,35,,1.0,3/1/2015,"The Venice, Fl Chilis is the worst in the chain. We weren't happy with the service and there was a boisterous party in the same seating area we were in a year ago when we went there. The food was not bad This time we were even more disappointed. Our waitress took our drink order, returned with our drinks and said she'd be back even though we were ready to order. We were finished with our first beer before I finally was able to flag her down to remind her we hadn't ordered yet. I ordered the chicken fajitas which I have had before. There was a glob of something on top of the chicken. I asked the waitress what it was and she said chipotle butter. I tasted it and told her it was nasty. I should have asked or she should have offered to have it remade. I should have also known the order had been sitting because the fajitas were not sizzling when she brought them to the table. The onions and green peppers were soggy and over cooked. I was able to get a stack of napkins form the work station close to us so I could wipe all the grease/chipotle butter off the chicken. We had to flag our waitress down to ask for check  when she finally brought the check I told her those were the worst fajitas I have ever had as they had always been one of my favorites and the chipotle butter ruined it. She said I can request they not put that on. She got a 10% tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-venice
Suzanne H.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",0,8,,4.0,2/27/2011,"I simply adore going to Chili's Restaurant. From the moment you enter the restaurant, you are greeted with a friendly, positive attitude. The service is great. The food is always fresh, different, fast and most importantly delicious.  Continue your excellence and you will always have my family as  customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-venice
