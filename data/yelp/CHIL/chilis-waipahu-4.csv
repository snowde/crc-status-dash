Ben Y.,"Pearl City, HI",59,57,,4.0,1/6/2018,"I appreciated the manager reaching out to me and trying to make things better. I understand that no place is gonna be perfect. But the reason why I bumped up my rating to a four stars without even stepping foot into the doors yet is the fact that the manager had the patience to listen to my frustrations and tried to make things better. No excuses were given, just a simple apology for my experience. I left our conversation feeling valued and appreciated.  I will give this location another try!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4
Livingston L.,"Anchorage, AK",17,1,1,1.0,10/12/2017,"Am getting really frustrated with what was favorite place....  I wrote a review and post a picture of a waiter who was putting his hands down his pants in the front and back, tucking in his shirt 11 days ago, and then went onto serving food without even washing his hands first. Days later a ""Mickey"" contacted me and in a professional manner apologized followed by an offer to come back. He also asked that I email him to provide a chance to send me a few coupons to use for another visit that would allow his team to redeem themselves.  I replied and after a week, there has yet to be a response from the manager who claimed improved and impressive service......  So much for the weekly trips to take the Family out to that Chilis; even though the food there is awesome, having a guy touching where the sun don't shine and then my food is unsat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4
Joy S.,"Honolulu, HI",87,53,101,4.0,10/9/2017,"I am a stickler for customer service, as I feel, this is the factor that often makes a food establishment stand out for me. That being said, I love the variety of food available at chili's...it's a nice place to eat when you want something pretty low-key, but tasty.  I ordered the 6oz sirloin steak and broccoli (no starch). The server was very attentive, making sure our fountain drinks were constantly filled, sometimes anticipating our needs before we were aware of our own needs - this is often a sign of an experienced server.  I ordered my steak medium done, but when I cut into it, it was medium well. I brought this to the attention of our server, who was very apologetic and immediately offered to have the steak redone. As I waited for my meal, the manager, Mickey, came over to the table to apologize and offered a bowl of soup while I waited. In the time it took to have my steak redone, both the server and the manager checked on our table and apologized profusely for the error.  Although chili's is a relatively low-key, family restaurant, they treated us as though they valued our service. I've consistently had relatively good service at chili's, with this experience being the most memorable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4

I wanted to acknowledge our server Jordan for his exceptional service.  I wish I got this kind of service wherever I dined. He was prompt and efficient and made sure we had what we wanted and that everything met our standards. I ask for a lot of side condiments and at times I feel like an inconvenience asking for things.

We were shopping out at the outlet stores and decided to stop in for an early dinner. We were seated at the bar area for some reason. It was a bit loud with several TVs playing and multiple people at the bar. Our server, Jessica, was a very prompt and sweet. We ordered some ice tea for drinks, followed by the shrimp and steak fajitas for dinner. My daughter really enjoyed the fajitas. For dessert we had the chocolate molten lava cake. The cake was very chocolatey and moist, definitely a good choice for dessert. Other than the restaurant being a bit too loud, it was a good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4
Jace T.,"Honolulu, HI",181,160,2032,2.0,8/20/2017,"Wasn't my choice to come here, but if I had a choice this wouldn't be an option... located in the lower half of Waikele Premium Outlets where the McD's is... Layout of the place is similar to others locations and have the same menu as other locations... my kids for some reason love to come here... My opinion of the food here is like going to the frozen section of a grocery store, heating up the food, plating and then serving! My kids said they liked what they had and couldn't finish all and made a doggie bag for the rest to take home. As for my plate of their version of the Rib Eye with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes... the meat was a little tougher than it looked and the seasoning was very heavy and salty! Even the broccoli was so salty that I couldn't eat all of them... the only item that was decent was the mash potatoes and that's pretty sad for a Rib Eye dish! That or I'm too spoiled with tender meat that doesn't feel like rubber in my mouth as I chew :/ Service was okay... my kids were giving him a hard time so I can understand he didn't wanna come around as often... we didn't run out of water but he did take his take to clear our tab because the tablet on our table wasn't working...  Chilis would be the perfect place for a gathering if the food tasted more like how it was priced! We could've gotten fresher and better tasting dishes from someplace cheaper!

Emily N.,"Honolulu, HI",4,52,107,4.0,8/15/2017,"The location of this Chili's is great because there are many good shopping places nearby.  There are also a few food trucks to choose from when you get hungry and crave a small snack. We had to wait about 5-10 minutes before we were seated.  Our server was extremely friendly and positive from the get-go.  I used the free Yelp coupon (if you ""check-in"" on Yelp) to get a free chips and queso.  I always love Chili's chips because they are so thin and crispy.  Unfortunately, some of the chips were really oily so they ended up being stale.  They always give more chips, so it was easy to get a refill and forget about the sad, wet chips.  The queso was delicious and unhealthy as usual.  I've never really liked their salsa though... I ordered the chicken enchiladas.  It came with three chicken enchiladas, Mexican rice, and beans.  My dad ordered beef quesadillas while my mom got the prime rib tacos.  All of it was delicious, and I only ate ONE chicken enchilada because I was so full!  That must be a record for me (I eat a lot).  My mom insisted that I try one of her prime rib tacos, and I will admit, it was delish.  However, the juices that the prime rib was in was a little too salty for my liking.

That was good. We had the chips with salsa and guacamole and that was great! My bf had the salad with bowl of chili. Salad went well, but the bowl of chili? Either it was spoiled or they use some funky ingredient in the chili. It tasted pretty darn gnarly.

It was nice that we were given complimentary chips and salsa, as a few of us were already hungry.  I did't realize till after I had already eaten my salad that there were no dried cranberries on it.  I brought that to Anthony's attention and he was apologetic about it.  Oh well, my fault for not telling him when I first got the salad.  The last sister that arrived ordered a salad and the chicken avocado flat bread which I tried to find on the menu and could find it?  Will need to find out if Chili's has a happy hour special on the appetizers, like maybe half off during a certain time frame.  It was quite busy this night, but we all enjoyed ourselves.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4

Lyla D.,"Honolulu, HI",541,1014,13824,3.0,12/22/2015,"After a round of golf out at the hot and sunny Ewa Plains, our foursome planned to head back East to enjoy a lunch together and commiserate, er, rehash the highs and lows of our round.  Unfortunately, because there had been a six car accident on the H-1 East we all got caught in gridlock.  We quickly texted each other and decided to exit off to the Waipio neighborhood to dine at Chili's. This site has a lot of parking and can accommodate the crowds from the nearby Premium Outlet Mall as well as several other smaller establishments.  There was a waitlist of 20 minutes which seemed reasonable since we noticed all of the tables in the dining room were full.  The hostess offered to seat us in the empty bar area where we could watch television, grab ourselves some cold beverages and probably be waited on right away.   While we waited for a server, the hostess began seating more people in the bar area along with us.   A friendly server came, introduced herself as the bartender and took our beverage order.  She returned quickly with our order and asked if we were ready to order.  We weren't quite ready, so understandably, she went onto the other tables.  It wasn't until after she had taken food orders for the other tables, most of which were large parties, that she returned to check on us and to take our order. The food was decent and eventually another worker came to assist the bartender by refilling our beverages and delivering our dishes.   We all had ordered their ""Big Mouth Burgers"" with fries.  Each of our burgers was nicely presented, flavorful and done to our liking. Sorry to say but we felt sorry for the poor gal as she was getting overwhelmed.  I know that she had no control over the amount of people coming in to dine but, the shift leader should have at least seen to getting more help into the bar area.  Service was pleasant but very slow. #497",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=60

In the photo in the menu, it looked as if the cobbler filled the entire skillet and was cooked/baked in it. (Please look for it and tell me it does not look like that lol.) To our great disappointment, a hot skillet did come but a pre-made slice of blueberry cobbler cake sat in the middle of it. You know damn well they did not cook what is clearly a slice of cake in that skillet lol. What was the point of the hot skillet at all though, is my question. For show? So we could pretend that it was what was in the photo? They could've just put the slice of cake on a plate lol. It was the saddest thing. We got nothing else after our cake slice in a hot skillet (we were going to drink but opted not to give them anymore of our money, despite sitting at the bar already) and we left practically not wanting to pay for it because if it wasn't even cooked at the restaurant, why come to a restaurant at all?

Chablis T.,"Waipahu, HI",9,45,64,1.0,1/5/2017,"Kiosk review: Solely based on kiosk card payments.  MAKE YOUR OWN CALCULATIONS.  It automatically adjusts the suggested tip to 20%. However ""their"" calculated 20% is marked up to approximately 25%.  That's a lot of money taken from tourists & locals that frequent this location who don't know any better. I definitely support tipping our servers and will overtip for their service most times. It's not right to be fooled into over tipping.  UPDATE: The business manager Mickey had reached out to me to explain how their kiosks work. Basically if you have a coupon (which I didn't have). The kiosk will calculate your tip based on the entire total bill BEFORE the discounted prices to ensure that the servers are being tipped for the food they serve. Ok...I get that. So if they void an item on your receipt because of a mistake with the order taken your tip will still be automatically calculated as if you had ordered that item. In other words, just calculate your own tip rather than paying what they recommend. I can guarantee that everyone at the establishment knows how the kiosk system is set up. Not accusing anyone that they make voids on purpose. But! It's a slick move to keep voiding items to increase the tip amount assuming the customer doesn't check and just hits ok to the automatically suggested/adjusted ""20%"" amount.  After looking at my receipt, there were voids. Because the server took my order wrong and had to ring the correct order up again. It adjusted to calculate my tip on the entire bill before the voids. Which is why my tip calculated higher.  No change in stars because from what I'm told the kiosk system is out of their control at the store level.

I honestly thought the food wasn't great but I give this place FIVE stars because of the exceptional customer service our server delivered. I can't quite remember his name just yet but he was accommodating and patient with our BIG party of 15. He was attentive, funny, quick, and communicated very well with when our orders will be out.

The restaurant was not as busy, as I thought it would be, on a Sunday which was great. I got the ""nachos"". They were horrible!!! They were made with pita chips. I had about 8-10 chips. When it came put there were greasy, no crunch at all, and very very bendable. They also tasted stale. However, my families food was amazingly good.

Nicole Y.,"Mililani, HI",416,233,702,3.0,10/15/2016,"I haven't really been to chili's much but since the kiddos love eating here, this was the restaurant of choice. Since the Mililani restaurant is usually packed,  I headed to the Waikele location for dinner. I didn't know this but you can call ahead to make a reservation. Luckily, the wait was only 15 minutes for a table.  Once seated we were greeted by our server, whom became MIA when it was time to order. I must say, I was impressed with their menu as they added healthier menu options like quinoa, asparagus and expanded their lighter menu choices. I do love their drink menu.. coronita time for me! We decided on a flat bread pizza and fajitas. The flat bread pizza was delicious! However the fajitas were a fail. Very few pieces of meat and the veggies weren't cooked thoroughly.  I always love my dinner company more than the food here. Since the kiddos love eating here, chili's will still be one of the dinner options for us.

Jennifer rocked the service tonight, was both prompt and courteous, and didn't miss a beat with asking us if we wanted margaritas, and making sure that our glasses were never empty. Thanks again! This Chilis stands above the rest of the Oahu locations, and is the standard for others to follow. Outstanding service by Shayna, whose courtesy and prompt service ensured that our glasses were always filled and our food looked and tasted great; give her the ""aloha spirit"" award! This place highlights teamwork: when the soda machine's carbonation failed, her manager Triton quickly worked to get the drinks back up to standard.

Gabrielle C.,"Pearl City, HI",198,103,642,5.0,11/15/2016,"I've came to this location various times in the past years and will review based on our experience today.  We came on a Tuesday afternoon around 2:30pm and were welcomed as soon as we came in. There was no wait, and was seated right away. It was my boyfriend and I and my sleeping son in his stroller and they gave us a booth to accomodate his stroller which I love! We were asked if we wanted drinks as we sat and were checked on a lot along with many water refills without us having to ask. To start off we got the appetizer trio with the egg rolls, boneless buffalo wings, and onion rings and it was brought fresh and hot to our table within 5-10 minutes. We ordered the chicken crispers, side mac and cheese, extra honey mustard sauce, and the shrimp and steak fajita. All of our food came out by the time we were done with our appetizers which was execellent! No wait at all at this visit but which shkuld be expected aince they were not busy. We ordered our dessert, our favorite the chocolate molten lava cake, off the ziosk and it came within 5 minutes as well. Everything was tasty, delicious, and fresh with no complaints. I loved how our waitress anx staff always came to check on us and could do a little small talk as we enjoyed a peaceful lunch while our crazy, busy toddler took his nap. A chilis I've always returned to.  The ONE thing i do have to say though is as we were walking out, i was carrying my son and my boyfriend had the stroller and take out food. They have double doors for the entrance/exit. The hostess at the stand saw us walking out hands full and everything and said ""Thank you!!... OH"" and nothing after as she just watched us struggling to get everything through the double doors. I've been a hostess before. Yes you should always greet and thank, but also you should help customers with the doors when needed. Its part of their experience.  Please dont just watch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=40

Mark G.,"Waipahu, HI",247,25,24,5.0,11/14/2016,"It was a chilly night, literally Chilis kind of night. We had a warm and cozy table near the window. The atmosphere was great and not crowded.  Our waitress was nice and she greeted us with a smile which is very rare now days. And she was the twin double of Ronda Rousey.  Free queso and chips for checking in Yelp was so bomb! My margarita was blazin just the way I like it. A waiter suggested a drink that they had but was not on the menu. The ""Blue pacific"". We enjoyed our margaritas a lot!  I had Triple Dipper and Southwestern Smokehouse Burger. The Tripple Dipper was a score. So much food for 14 bucks. I couldn't finish it all because of our free queso and chips. It was the same story with my girlfriend. We took it home. The customer service was nice enough to come and ask for boxes.  I would definitely come here again for some drinks and the dripple Dipper. The menu has great pictures to refer to and they have a screen to browse even more things on the menu. Our only suggestion is we wish they still have the Lava Float! We would have totally ordered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=40
Dynamite D.,"Waianae, HI",0,3,4,2.0,12/26/2017,"I love Chili's but this time, I wasn't satisfied with our food. We waited for our food for one hour 1/2, this was the longest i waited for a food to be serve. And when we finally receive our food, it wasn't that hot or warm enough, the rice we got was hard as well. I wasn't able to enjoy it so I barely touch it, I guess our server saw how disappointed I was, so she was trying to give us free dessert as an apology for the wait... she explained that they were short so their manager was the one on the kitchen helping so I wasn't able to talk to him. I'll give two star for our server since she was trying her best to satisfy our needs, but overall dissatisfied the way they serve our food, I don't mind waiting but to wait that long and be served with food that is not even warm is just too much. I think it will be a while before I come here or not at all. And I'm not sure what's their definition of busy cause it didn't even looked packed inside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=40

Nelly J.,"Honolulu, HI",24,18,21,5.0,11/7/2017,"Everytime we pass a Chili's my son begs me to go and I almost always say no. This time I said okay, and I'm happy we went. We went around 11:30 am and were greeted and seated immediately. Although we don't come here to watch sports, the TVs had football games showing. My 7 year old son immediately went to play unlimited games on the Ziosk for $1.99. Our server, Maxie, appeared with a friendly smile to introduce herself and take our drink order. I think they changed their kids' cups because it was bigger and the kind you can't take home. I personally prefer the new cup because my son drinks a lot and we don't need more of them at our house. I was a little bummed they no longer had the buffalo cauliflower but consoled myself with their triple dipper with my favs of south western egg rolls, honey chipotle tenders, and panko onion rings. My son ordered the bacon quesadillas. I also decided to try their new black cherry lemonade. Definitely no disappointment there until maybe when it's replaced by a new flavor. I decided to check in on yelp and what do you know, free chips and queso! Oh my, just another appetizer my son fell in love with. Maxie was super awesome about bringing that out promptly and even refilling the chips and salsa. All the food was delicious and I like that about chain restaurants, they're pretty consistent on presentation, temperature, portion, and flavor. Oh and they take ID cards here in case you have one and would like a discount. Thank you Maxie and Chili's for another pleasant experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=40

Chili's Grill & Bar in Waikele, O'ahu, Hawai'i. My friends and I had a wonderful visit here. We enjoyed everything from the customer service to the great tasting food and very bubbly atmosphere. To begin our visit, from the time you walk into the restaurant the hostess was inviting and cheery and it didn't take long to get us seated as we could see that the restaurant was steady. Every employee had smiles on there faces so I know they enjoyed their jobs. We got seated and was greeted by this amazing waitress named Stephanie, pleasant and vivacious. After a long lunch, she had such energy and her customer service was spot on. She was informative about all the specials, gave great feedback on the food we ordered and made sure the quality of our food was immaculate before she served it. Our food had great temperature and tasted like it should have, DELICIOUS! Shephanie's manager had to come and seen us because one of the food items didn't look right and explained why it would take a few more minutes for guacamole to be done. Since the guacamole didn't look as expected, they were making a new batch and we thought it was awesome to know Kat the manager was able to communicate with her patrons.  When our meal was through, they didn't rush us out of the restaurant like most establishments do these days. Stephanie simply refilled our glasses and asked if we'd like dessert but we couldn't eat another bite.

Chastity M.,"Kapolei, HI",15,14,4,5.0,6/11/2017,"Had dinner there tonight because one of my besties decided she wanted to get this expectant mama exactly what she was craving; steak & mashed potatoes. Upon arriving, we were seated by the hostess & introduced to our AMAZING waitress, Kristen  Kristen was so polite, sweet and energetic, & never failed to check on us throughout the evening. So fast forward to after receiving our order.. being 3 1/2 months pregnant, I had to order my steak WELL DONE & cause the cravings for mashed potatoes was REAL... I ordered 2 sides (replacing the broccoli with mash) of the loaded mash. She hadn't brought out the food to us (another waiter had) but that didn't bother us. I cut into the meat and honestly couldn't really tell if it was well done or not, cause I'm always a medium rare kind of girl and it seemed OKAYYYYY to me. But a little while later... she came to check on us and she was like ""Oh no girl, that is NOT well done! I'm taking that back for you. I'm so sorry"" I don't like to be a person that ever has to send my food back so I wouldn't have said anything when I did start noticing a lil bit of a pinker meat. Anyhow, she took it to the back, brought me back a side of mash to munch on in the meantime while they made me a whole new 10 Oz steak! She apologized again and reassured me my food would be out shortly. The manager then brought me out my new plate, with 2 sides of mash as well! It was like I hadn't even previously had a plate at all! But I very well did finish one whole side of mash on the first plate as well as half through the steak. Upon making sure the steak was well done, the manager apologized again & offered us free dessert on her. Their service was ABOVE AND BEYOND... they were all very energetic, polite, and showed sincerest apologies when I didn't even feel they needed to apologize that much but appreciated it. That is exactly how customer service should be done  I would highly recommend this location and of course, my brothers & sisters in Christ love Chilis! So I would recommend Chilis overall.

They put the chicken over the asparagus, which in turn seasoned the asparagus even more! On top of the chicken was pico de gallo. The black beans were on the side in a small bowl.  The chicken was seasoned so well and cooked to perfection! The asparagus was barely cooked, same for the cherry tomatoes. It was good, but I've had them better at different Chili locations.

Ann N.,"Honolulu, HI",50,329,855,3.0,6/15/2017,"We have traditionally banned all Chili's due to lack of service and poor food quality, but since we were at Waikele's, opted for this place.  We went on a Monday around 1pm. We were seated quickly so that was great. We had the cheese fries with extra jalapeño. I have to say, they were delish. I would def have them again. Sadly, our meals were not on the same caliber. I ordered cheese enchiladas. Barely edible. It tasted like it was loaded with sliced american cheese. The rice was either undercooked or fried too long as it was hard. I don't like black beans so can't comment on that. The kid had 1/2rack of ribs with rice. Her rice was hard as well. The ribs had little meat and lots of inedible parts. My man ordered the 3pc something or other. Spring rolls, fried pickles and 2 sliders. He saved his food for dinner as he was already full from the appetizers. The pickles def had a tangy punch when you chewed it. The slices were thicker than what you would traditionally get at a bar. The dip it came with was good. So I'd rate the pickles as ok. Can't tell u about the spring rolls or sliders. Ut since he ate them later that night, I'll assume they were ok. Our waitress came and refilled our drinks several times, so a plus for service. Also, having checked in on Yelp, we received a free basket of chips and salsa with a bean dip. Not a meat eater, I realized I was chomping on something that felt ""meaty/chewy"". It was confirmed so I stopped eating it. But the bean part was tasty. I also don't care for super thin chips, so not a deal-breaker.  If we went again, I'd stick to my usual of veggie burger. Can't go wrong with a standard. I'll leave the Mexican dishes to a Mexican restaurant as well. And ribs...well, a rib or steakhouse joint. But the cheese fries were a winner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=20

Chanel M.,"Mililani, HI",70,70,27,3.0,3/15/2015,I came here the other night to celebrate my friends birthday.  The waitress was awesome. Good service and stuff. I felt bad for her cause she had to deal wit alot of people in my party.  But the reason y im giving 3 stars is because towards the ending of our night we was waiting for our food and the manager comes out says if you guys want dessert please let us know asap because the kitchen closes in 5 mins. Im like wth? But ok. Im pretty sure if you work in a restaurant your not suppose to do that to the customers by rushing them.  I also heard that she was giving people their checks while their eating. I find that very rude. Your suppose to give the customers their check at the end when they are done eating n stuff just in case if they want to order something else.  I always come to this chilis and i actually never had any problems before. This was the best chilis but not that night. The manager was jus not cool.  But im pretty sure the mangers name is gladys.

Hoku T.,"Honolulu, HI",321,120,395,3.0,12/2/2013,"The food is always good, no matter the selections from appetizers to entrees - all are great!  A few things I enjoy eating at Chili's is their Tortilla Chicken Enchilada Soup! Lunch or dinner, it's always a must for me to have - cup or bowl.  Next is their endless Chips and Salsa! You can't go wrong when you have this all you can eat snack! It's even awesome when you have a good waiter or waitress that gets you a To-Go bag and foam bowl to take home this awesome snack! Can't forget their Strawberry Lemonade! I can take a gallons worth by the end of the night! Also awesome when a waiter or waitress lets you take a To-Go cup home of this great nectar on your travels home.  Sadly - the only part of this experience being poor is the waiters and waitress. It's sad to go with a group of 8 or more and expect to pay gratuity of 18% tip when service is really poor. Waiters and Waitresses being asked numerous of times for the same items and not paying attention when customers drinks are low or empty plates crowd the table. Even on nights when it's not busy, the service seems to stay the same. But I still enjoy the food and drinks!  My tip would be to find a good waiter or waitress and go there during their shifts.

I'll focus on tonight's trip... We have a 2-month-old baby who gets very comfortable once in her stroller. The hostess originally suggested a table for us but said we'd have to take the car seat part out and leave the stroller in front... When I asked if we could keep the stroller, she immediately offered to accommodate us and didn't even seem the least bit annoyed. She seated us and our babe (w/ stroller) immediately and with a smile.  We were off to a great start. Our waiter, Colton, was equally amazing. He was sweet, attentive and patient. When the bar ran out of Coors light, he offered my hubby the larger sized beer at no charge to apologize for the inconvenience. The food was awesome.

I'm not sure how you are suppose to make more than 1-2 fajitas with the portion of guacamole and tomatoes they give it is about 1-2 tablespoon.

They billed me for the chips and Queso which was later removed when I pointed out. Waitress blamed the manager. I have had better food definitely. Will not be back.

Amber-Lynn H.,"Honolulu, HI",631,115,212,1.0,7/14/2015,"Positive streak broken, Chili's to go FAIL. Picked up some food for a friend & I to indulge in some guilty pleasures while watching the sunset on the north shore. And being that Chili's Waikele has been super on it the last few months, I was happy to order from them. Ordered a burger no red onions and the triple dipper (onion rings, cheddar bites, Boneless chicken wings). Simple. Not so much. While I was on the phone with Tim, he didn't ask about how I wanted the burger cooked. No problem. So I let him know I wanted the burger cooked to medium (meaning some pink in the middle). He didn't get what I was asking for and had me repeat it 3 more times. I was able to pick it up 15 minutes after calling it in. I get there and Tim confirms only the burger part of my order repeating no red onions & cooked medium, but only said triple dipper when confirming the 2nd half. Didn't think anything of it until now. But seriously, why not just be consistent and follow through if you think it's important to make sure it's right. Well, here we are opening up the food...the triple dipper had big mouth bites. Not crispy cheddar bites. Mind you, which sounds nothing alike aside from the ""bites."" Normally I'd be flexible and just go with it. But let's get to the regular sized burger we ordered....it was cooked well done. When you bit into it it was not tender, juicy like a medium burger would be. It was chewy, crumbly and on the dry side. Big appetite turn off. And if they can't get the regular burger right, it's hard for me to believe they could get the mini burgers right. Huge disappoint and an even bigger waste of money. I wonder if take out orders are served at a lesser standard where quality doesn't matter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=120

This is just automatic over here so don't be too picky and just choose the parking by Lowes. The service here.... What service anymore? Lol they switched to these iPad-like devices and that's for the most part how you order, pay, and play games. BEWARE however about the games. The games are $1.99 and they don't clearly say you pay for the games. Me and my gf started to play and thought the games were free. We should've known better than to think anything now these days are free. After you get mad at the fact that you paid for games without knowing, at least you'll be entertained by the receipt printing function that comes with it. I thought that was something... The food here is good for the most part. Take advantage of your check-ins here because they give free salsa and chips with it. Me and my gf always get the tripple dipper here. The sliders are pretty good, the egg rolls are crunchy and splendid, the honey bbq chicken is saucey and pretty good, and the onion rings are okay. I just wish that they had three different sauces like before. They only had ranch sauce with the triple dipper just recently.  The desserts are okay too. The molten chocolate is wayyyyy to chocolatey. If you love chocolate then I suggest getting this but if you don't wanna be diabetic, I suggest not getting this.

My waitress Chantelle was patient with me and helped me with figuring out my orders which turned out smoothly.

Not a lot of people that accommodate me for the very first time gets it right but the employees here got it on point! Very attentive and caring always checking up on me. I give credit to the back kitchen also! Food came out perfect timing, my spicy chicken came out right and I enjoyed eating their smoked chicken with bacon and avocado flatbread. To be honest their chicken tasted a lot cleaner than another place I am a regular at so looks like I will be coming back often hopefully not too late.

Hope Y.,"Honolulu, HI",275,221,198,2.0,1/19/2015,"So we decided to get a late lunch at the Waikele Chili's, waited a few minutes (as to be expected since this is always a busy site) and got our table. They asked if we needed a high chair (had the grandbaby with us) and set us up in a back area, near the kitchen. No problems with the seating, and they gave us lots of space (4 adults and a baby). The waitress was nice, but to no fault of hers, the cooks were awful. We ordered our drinks and appetizers, and when the Texas cheese fries came out, it was not... acceptable. I am not usually one to send things back, but I sent those cheese fries back as soon as she set them on the table. They were burnt, the cheese was no where to be seen, and it looked like it was sitting under the warmer light for an hour. She brought us another Texas fries, which looked a little better, but not by much. My order was for 2 enchiladas, with ""all rice"" (no beans). When my plate came out, it looked like they started to put beans on the plate, then removed the beans to give me all rice. It looked like a skid mark of beans on the edge of the plate. I get it, it was a mistake, but maybe take some pride in your work and wipe the mistake off! I wasn't about to send it back, since it didn't affect me one way or the other, but I was just like wth?  Nail in the coffin: we were at the end of our meal, and then it sounds like some of the kitchen staff went on break or they were hanging out around the corner. Either way, we couldn't see them, but we could definitely hear them. F-this and F-that. I'm not a prude, I drop the F-bomb myself, but these guys are in hearing range of me and my family, which i'm dropping $90 for a family meal and I gotta hear swearing after an extremely mediocre meal....their saving grace was the waitress, otherwise it would've been 1 star for my experience this weekend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=220

Came here after a good round of golf with some friends who all had worked up an appetite and were very thirsty.  Arriving here at 4:30 ( pre- peak time) made it easy for our group to find seating which is not always the norm at most locations that are usually very busy and have long lines and waiting lists. Upon entering the restaurant we were immediately acknowledged and greeted by several employees and seated at our preference. And this is where we received outstanding and friendly service from our server Kristian. Kristian was attentive to all of our needs and stayed cheerful throughout our stay which at times is no easy task with a bunch of loud, thirsty, and hungry golfers. After making sure that the thirst factor was addressed she immediately took our orders and made helpful suggestions from the menu that assisted in our selections for the feast which included several sampler platters,flatbred and some other delicious sides. It did not take long for our orders to arrive and quiet the noisy starving golfers who were enjoying the refreshing beverages and delicious food. For me the food here was never an issue, what makes any place standout is the service you receive that makes for the total dining experience.

I'm am particularly fond of Thomas and Alicia. They are fast, smart and kind.  The hubby always gets the sirloin, which normally doesn't disappoint but recently the quality has changed. We actually sent them back because they were cold and raw. Yesterday he ordered it medium and it came medium rare, which is fine. What bothered us was the seasoning was uneven. Half the steak was good and the other half eh.. The California flatbread is crunchy and delish. I always take home 1/2 because it's filling. The burger is affordable and yummy. Many love the chicken crispers but it's a lot of beading an oil for me. Addendum: I rarely have any issues here, which is why I am a regular, I should add if there ever was an issue, the food was comped or we were provided dessert or chips.

Decided to try Chili's since i swear i don't remember eating here in Cali. Walked in & was seated right away. The host didn't even say one word. He saw us, grabbed menus, & we just followed him. Kind of rude! Our waiter came to take our orders. He was nothing special.  We ordered the build your own appetizer & chose double of the hamburger sliders & the southwest eggrolls. We also ordered a caesar salad. My daughter ordered chicken strips with warm apples & cinnamon on the side. After a 25 minute wait, we got our food! The hamburger sliders were great! The meat was cooked medium rare. It had grilled onions & bacon. Very tasty! The caesar salad was your typical salad. Nothing special.   Chili's has a very extensive menu!

When she gave our onion rings to us she asked ""do they look okay?"" The chopped parsley that were sprinkled on top of the rings were also old and the rings were really dark brown.

I used our check in and got the free chips and queso.  Highly recommended as the chips are fresh and the queso is something out of the ordinary.  I had the mushroom swiss burger with onion strings.  The burger was moist with lots of flavor from the mushrooms and cheese.  I would say pass on the onion strings and get fries instead.  Onion strings were more oil than anything else.  My wife got the bacon advacado chicken sandwich.  Yum!  My son got the big bites which he loved.  It's 4 bar burgers/sliders that come with chopped up bacon and onions.  If you have young kids they can probably share this.  2 each.  Guaranteed they will love it.  My daughter tried the cheese quesadillas with corn on the cob on the side.  All smiles!  Total price $50. Overall a great restaurant for a family with young kids.  In fact there were a lot of families there today for lunch. Oh and what really impressed me was the unlimited refills on soda and they bring NEW cups every time.  I am a germaphobe so I like the fact that they don't bring my used cup back to the soda machine to refill it.  If they don't bring my cup back then that means they don't bring other customers' cups back as well.  2 thumbs up for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=180

Our waitress was very friendly, & on it w/ replenishing our water & napkins without one of us having to ask.

I must add that Gladys (supervisor / manager) came to our table twice, she greeted us 20mins after we sat down, made small talk which we thought was a plus!

Good bye Memphis dry rub (sheds tears) The old chicken margherita came with a chicken breast on rice pilaf with black beans. This new chicken margherita comes with roasted tomatoes and two sides. Boyfriend ordered it with asparagus and loaded mash. The asparagus isn't cooked in a skillet, but simply put onto the grill. It looked raw and tasted raw. The only cooked part was the middle. We asked for them to recook it; they offered us a new batch of asparagus. However, we didn't receive until about 10 minutes later and we had to remind our server to get it, which was when boyfriend was nearly finished with his dish. It sucks we had to wait so long for it but even worse was that it was presented basically the same: raw.  Boyfriend was very unhappy. So that makes me unhappy.

The last time I was at this location was over 2 years ago. Not because I didn't like the food or anything. But because I like closer to the pearlridge one. Either way, a LOT has changed since my last visit. The menu has a bunch of new, delicious and hard to choose from choices. They have a new system where you have a small ipad-like tablet on your table and you could use it to order drinks (and food items) from your table. You can also play games and pay from there by swiping your card. Need a receipt? Not a problem! It pop's a little one out for you. If this thing made phone call I'd start to think that Steve Jobs isn't dead but simply hiding out at Chili's. I played it safe and just got a bacon burger. My girlfriend got a taco trio sampler thing. It sounded good but was a bit on the disappointing side. However, the tablet felt a little (very small very tiny detail) grimy. A quick wipe down after the people leave would be a good choice is all. Now aside from the food and the new items and apple products. The best thing about my recent visit was my server. Her name was Melissa and she was amazing! She knew everything and walked us through the menu and the tablet. If we had questions she wouldn't stammer or stutter, she knew the exact answer. She anticipated our every need, check on us enough times and didn't bother us. She did such a great job that we told her manager how good she was. Even she agreed with us.

He gave us outstanding service and the recommendations that he made were on point. It was the perfect ending to a stressful day, great service and great food. Thank you Jordan for continuing to make Chili's my favorite spot! Today is March 12th and also my son's 7th Birthday. We have him a choice of where he wanted to have dinner and he chose Chili's Waikele. It was crazy busy which was fine, my Mom got their before us and Denise and Rayleen kept my Mom and get husband entertained. They were friendly, funny and accommodating as much as they could be while they waited. The wait was about an hour which didn't matter cause the service is worth it. Our server was Colt, he was also AMAZING! Very friendly, patient and quick. He was very apologetic because he felt that he didn't attend to us as much as he should have due to the busyness but that was not the case, he was very attentive and an excellent server. He always made sure that we were taken cared of and we were. The crew sang the Birthday song for my baby, he was happy. Before we left Colt made sure we had our to go boxes and food and that we were all good before we left. Our visit was awesome as usual and I'm grateful to Colt and the Chili's crew for making my son's Birthday memorable!

I live up in Mililani, but I frequent to the Waikele Chili's more often because there is usually less of a wait and it is a bit more quieter.   My bf and I love the baby back ribs.  I love the memphris rub, he goes for the original sauce.   I usually get corn and broccoli for the sides, but there are other choices such as sweet potato fries, cole slaw, rice, and mash potato.  A Must Have dessert is the Oreo Molten.  Half white/half chocolate cake with a creamy (not sure what kind of creme, tastes like melted ice cream) center, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  The cake portion is heated, making it a delight to the senses. Service is not the fastest here, but usually very pleasant staff.  We usually wait about 10-15 minutes for a seat at dinner time, about the same to put in an order, and then about 30 minutes for the food to come.  Not a place to come to if you are in a rush or need to get to an early movie.  Great to come to relax, they even serve alcoholic beverages.  Lava flow ftw!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=180

But he wanted the games. Had a huge tantrum, walked around for a bit, still wanted it, so I let him win this battle: wasn't worth it cause I already felt stressed out. I just wish Chilis would have ""warned"" parents, I dunno, cause some parents limit screen time and dangling awesome new entertainment in front of kids is just asking for trouble. Now let's get to the food... We love their burgers!! We almost always get them because they sub broccoli for free as a healthy alternative. Yet, they got my entire order wrong. I ordered broccoli, they have me fries. I wanted the new turkey guac burger no mayo. I got a regular burger. I just ate it cause I was still upset about the media thing and I was pretty hungry. I told the waitress, she offered to send it back, but I was already halfway done so oh well. I would have liked more to be done. Sending it back would have only made me wait longer to eat, thus making my kids wait longer for me, and allowing them more media time...see where this vicious cycle ends?

Michael C.,"Honolulu, HI",378,724,4179,1.0,11/6/2012,"I was unsure whether or not to post this update, but in the end I felt it might be helpful to others and future customers: I had dinner with a friend at this location this past Saturday, November 3.  We were seated immediately and received more than satisfactory customer service throughout our entire visit.  In the end, I decided to use my debit card to pay for the meal since I did not have enough cash.  My friend and I decided to leave a cash tip, and as I have always done in the past I drew a line thru the tip section/line on the check to signify that I WAS NOT leaving a tip on the card.  I then wrote in the total ($44.55) to be charged on the card and we left the restaurant. Today, Monday, November 5, as I was checking my banking statement online, I discovered the total deducted for Chili's that night was $10 more than the bill.  At first I was upset to discover this, but came to my senses and called the bank, who then instructed me to call Chili's.  I spoke to the manager and he took down all the necessary information so he could research the transaction.  It turns out the server keyed in the wrong amount into their computer (or so the manager says), and therefore my card was charged for $54.55, with $10 being recognized as a tip.  His apology seemed genuine when he said was sorry for the inconvenience, and that the server was not a dishonest person and made a very careless mistake.  He informed me that they could credit back the $10 but it would take at least 2 days since this transaction had to be processed thru their corporate office in California.  He said he would call me to let me know when the transaction had been completed. Bottom Line:  I guess the moral is to double-check your credit card statements and/or banking statements for the correct amount processed.  I'm not terribly upset since the manager was helpful, but I'm very, very disappointed, and will most likely stay away from this location in the future.

Food was just okay, best thing we ordered was the steak and shrimp fajitas, sizzling hot.  It's chili's food, you know what you're getting and they prepare it well here, not much else to say.

If youve read my other reviews with Chili'ls, you'll see why.  Something is ALWAYS wrong with the order.   On this lunch visit, my wife ordered the BLAZIN Big Mouth Bites.  This is the 3rd time she's ordered it at a Chili's restaurant and this is the THIRD TIME THEY GOT IT WRONG.  They keep bringing us the regular Big Mouth Bites.  Not only did she say ""Blazin Big Mouth Bites"", but she pointed to it on the menu.  And it is a SEPARATE menu from the regular food menu. So.....either the servers are not paying attention to it at all, or they dont know the menu....I have no idea what was going on.  We really just wanted to try the Blazin burgers.....will we ever get a chance? The regular ones are good, so we just ate it....no biggie. Just the fact that it has happened 3 times has me concerned about it.   I ordered the Caribbean Salad with Chicken(13.99).  I like the salad...second time ive had it.  The cranberries on it are awesome.   Oh....and that drink that they always seem to be out of ""Cherry Lime something...""

He also picked up on a lot of things without really having to ask (for example, refills, take-out boxes, and noticing us browsing the dessert menu) and he well deserved the tips.

Joei G.,"Mililani, HI",291,58,72,3.0,6/6/2013,"Well this place is okay.... What I liked, the taste of the food, the menu items, and the pretty (sorry if this is superficial) and nice servers. Okay I guess I will start off with the good and end with the bad.  First off when I went that evening for dinner I ordered the salmon and baby back ribs combo. Both were very delicious. I enjoyed every single bite. The fish was cooked nicely and the bbq ribs were sweet and tangy the way I like it.  Besides what I had eaten, it was a bit hard to pick what I wanted. They have a nice selection and I will definitely go back to try other stuff.  Now lastly for this section the service, the food came out at a decent time and the server was very nice.  Now for the negative. In this review I place the negative last because this is a chain restaurant so certain negatives are expected. These restaurants have to do really bad in order to lose business. This restaurant is okay... Let me start first with what is not really under their control. This is the Waikele location, so expect parking to be somewhat annoying during the peak hours. The area they are in is small and gets quite congested at times. Since this is partly the fault of the designers of this shopping center I will not count this against them too much. Next let me get to the food. Like I said the food was good, but for the price the servings were way too small. Seriously, the quality was nothing spectacular even though it was very tasty. But then again maybe I'm a bit cheap. But the ribs were barely meaty, it almost seemed like most of the taste was from the bones, and the slice of salmon could have been a bit bigger. The combo was almost $25, but in my opinion it should probably only have been $16 or $17 tops. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who feels the same, but oh well let's just see how it goes for them with these prices. Now as I have mentioned I will probably come back. I will definitely choose a different selection and the food will most likely be tasty. Now I leave it to you to decide whether or not you feel like paying a little but extra for nothing special. I do not mean to sound very negative if that is how I came out. But like I said I did enjoy the food and service, but it's just the pricing is debatable. Anyways, I hope you have a pleasant experience if you choose to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=300

Brittany L.,"Port Orchard, WA",25,125,20,2.0,8/2/2011,"This chili's is pretty bad. It's unfortunate that it is the only restaurant in the area where I live. Ok this is based on many experiences. The first thing I need to say is that management needs to check on their employees. Almost EVERY time I come here the waiter charges me for an extra soda. I wouldn't put it past the staff there that they are charging extra drinks without customers knowing, and Voiding it at the end of their shift to make and extra $3. Ok with that said, always check your bill.  The last time I went here the server was awful. I wish I got her name. I ordered soup, and of course she forgot about it and ended up bringing it to our table after our meals came. At that point she should have told me she forgot to order it because who wants soup while they are trying to eat their meal? Not to mention, she didn't even bring it out to the table, the kitchen did and the soup was in between room temperature and cold. When she came back to ask how everything was I told her the soup was disgusting and cold. Her response... ""Well, I see the kitchen gave you a bowl instead of a cup for the soup even though I specifically rang in cup."" UM I don't care? I just want hot or even warm soup why are you even telling a customer this? If you have problems with the kitchen bringing out the wrong size nasty soup, then maybe you should have brought it out to the table and you would have seen it was wrong. And telling me such is completely unprofessional.  On the plus side, whenever I am eating in the bar area I always have the best service and the bartenders are great here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=300

John L.,"Waipahu, HI",0,8,9,3.0,2/5/2015,"My wife and I like to go to our local Chili's every month or two for a decent (a relative term, since we live in Hawaii) Tex-Mex dinner four or five blocks from our house.  No great expectations, we know what to expect with Chili's, but then...maybe not.   For starters, the menu has changed.  Where's my country fried steak???  That's been my old Chili's standby for the last 30 years.  You don't just drop something like that without letting customers know.  But that's not what this review is about. Rather, I have now been propelled into the DIY restaurant check era, whether I wanted to or not.  Our last visit was before Christmas.  Since then our local Chili's has installed a unique interactive video device called the ""Ziosk.""  I'm told this is common on the US Mainland, but it's new to us in Hawaii.  The host that seated us gave us a quick user demonstration/operational checkride on how we could reorder our bar drinks that we didn't order to start with, order dessert before we even met our server, get calorie information on menu items (if we were worried about calories we wouldn't be at Chili's), pay our bill including tip, and best of all, play video games while waiting or eating ($1.99 each).  I noticed there's an e-mail function also...don't even want to imagine how that worked.   Excuse me, but if I want all that meal-time video I'll go to my son's house for dinner, which would be delightful since he lives in Portland OR and has a wonderful wife. So we completed our meals, ordered a piece of cheesecake to take home, and were presented with an inventory of our orders with cost (as opposed to the traditional meal check).  Our server would happily take cash, but if we wanted to use a credit card...then we have to deal with Mr Ziosk.  Now check out the photo...can you see all the fingerprints on the Ziosk, not to mention a couple unidentifiable organic substances permanently attached to the screen?  I am relatively okay with the DNA I currently have, don't need anyone else's, thank you.  I have to say I was eager to get home and wash my hands once that Ziosk transaction was complete. About that transaction...once you're handed a check, that white-light area at the top center of the screen turns bright red.  After you pay it turns green...a color-coded, guilt-driven collection enforcement system!  If we got up and left before paying it probably would have set off sirens, red and blue flashing lights, and laser fire across the aisle.  But we did pay, and then it thoughtfully suggested a 20% tip which I felt duty-bound to pay, since we did have a nice server as usual.  You can slide the on-screen tip scale left and right for smaller or larger percentages, but that would require additional contact with that screen. As it is, I'm still getting used to sliding my credit cards in grocery and department store card readers, gas pumps, et al, so this didn't have a huge comfort factor for me.  Except...pretty soon we're eligible for a smart phone upgrade and an iPhone 6 is definitely in our future.  Apple Pay...just touch that screen...someday.  Okay, that's a leap I can make.  Like paying for Starbucks with my current iPhone 5 (we are so-o 2013) by scanning my secret gold card barcode...way cool.  I wouldn't go to Starbucks even a fraction of the times I do now if I couldn't pay with my iPhone!  So maybe the next time we go back to Chili's we can just hold our iPhone 6 on Mr Ziosk and the two can make nice without actually touching that screen.  It's a step in the right direction, I guess. Oh, and the food at Chili's was great as usual, and so were the staff.  Kicking and screaming into the 21st century!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=200

I took my son there for his birthday, and the food came out extremely slowly. A couple of orders were wrong and had to be returned. Then, the server came out with a plate of food spilling over. Something fell on the floor, and more of the food was about to do that. The server then pushes the food back onto her plate with her bare finger. I told her to get a new order and asked for her manager.  The food is okay, especially the chicken. I will never eat at that location again, though.  The only worse location was the one at Pearlridge. My family and I waited 30 minutes after being seated, never being given water or a menu.

The wait felt like a long time, especially since smaller parties were being seated quicker than larger parties. What we've been saying was combine tables. Our waitress was Janine, the best we could ask for! Friendly and already knew when the guys I was with wanted another round. They don't have Irish car bombs though! Initially I was going to order the quesadilla, but the ribs caught my eye right after. I guess I should've ordered that instead! As everyone else's food started coming out, I was eventually the only one without food in front of them. Janine noticed and checked up with the kitchen. When my food finally arrived, I noticed my fries were hot but my ribs COLD:  . I tried eating one rib, and it was dissatisfying! I even poked at the next rib where there was meat and damn, COLD. Told everyone at our table and had Janine take it back when she came by again. When I got my ribs back again, it was the SAME half slab but reheated with BBQ sauce. I tried a piece, and was totally over it. It was comped of course. But I guess if I wanted ribs I should've gone to Tony Roma's. After that, ordered dessert. I really wanted to try the cake but ordered the Brownie Sundae instead:  . Hot brownie and cold ice cream, can't mess that up right? Before ordering dessert, we felt rush when Janine thought we were ready to go, since she came with our check after someone asked for a box. Towards the end, they provided us a bag of chips and salsa.

It can get expensive, but it's totally up to the person who orders. ;) I personally love their Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers!! Its sauce is the right kind of sweet and spicy that I'm looking for. Plus, it is one of the choices in their marvelous Tripple Dipper Appetizer, which I always get with their really tasty spinach and artichoke dip! I would ask for fresh Nachos, without salt, as it brings out more of the flavor of the dip, for the salt doesn't overpower everything else. Speaking of, we had a really awesome server at Waikele, shout out to Jennay! Mahalo for your service :) Their choices varies from burgers to salads, steaks and seafood. Moreover, the beverages they offer completely compliments their meal!! Total YUM! Their blackberry ice tea is my preferred beverage- that you can ask to adjust the sweetness of- more or less syrup. ;) Not to mention their desserts! We always get the molten chocolate cake with the hard-cover chocolate (which is the ice cream being shelled by chocolate goodness) that is oozing with caramel and chocolate!  And! To those who counts their calories, Chili's labels the calorie count for each meal. They also serve light portions and other healthier options. So I salute thee for considering those who are on this particular way-to-go diet. :)  Of course there is the bar side and TV everywhere.

Emy R.,"Kapolei, HI",1126,91,1401,2.0,9/29/2013,"I don't know why my experiences with Chili's always ends up with overly salted food. One of our friends was being sent TAD (temporary assigned duty) to the Middle East and someone made the decision to meet here since it was more convenient for everyone. I wasn't too thrilled but oh well.  There probably isn't much I can say about Chili's that hasn't already been said. Chain restaurant, usually crowded especially on the weekends. Reservations are recommended and even with reservations you might have a bit of a wait. Tends to get noisy and the AC is on full blast so bring a light jacket if you are like me and tend to get cold with AC.  On this night I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak on the suggestion of a friend who claimed it was ""really good"" and said that's all he orders when he eats at any Chili's. Since he seemed to be the authority on Chili's cuisine (he and his wife apparently go every weekend) I decided to take the plunge and go for it. BIG MISTAKE. I should've stayed in my safety zone and ordered a burger.  My plate looked like a plate of barf, there was chunky white gravy everywhere and it was super salty. At first I thought it was the gravy so I ate around the gravy but the Chicken Fried Steak was still salty and so were the mash potatoes. I hardly touched my food and the friend who suggested it also said it was too salty and only ate half of his. When the waitress came to clear the table she asked if I wanted to box my food but I told her it was too salty. She did offer to have something else made but I declined.  The pros - friendly and attentive service & they make a pretty darn good beer-garita. For me, Chili's certainly isn't on the top my list of places that I have to eat at. Food is meh.

Joe S.,"Mililani, HI",54,274,429,3.0,9/28/2011,"Chilis.  They are known for their appetizers and baby back ribs. Recently, online, my wife and I learned they have a happy hour.  I'm excited about good bourbon and something to ""snack"" on while relaxing celebrating our latest project completion.   My wife had just completed a massive undertaking on an Excel spreadsheet she created from scratch and entering data... all done ahead of schedule.  To brag, she put in 71 hours last week.  That qualifies as an undertaking of monster mental complexity deserving of a treat on the town. I digress.  We decided on Chili's.  It's close and although a chain restaurant, can't be all that bad or they wouldn't be a chain, right?   Well... We arrived at 3pm on a Friday.  After a courteous staff allowed us to wait for a table or booth at the ""bar area"" (only location of happy hour) we were seated with only a 10 minute wait.  Enough time to review the menu and enjoy the scenery.  Tacky as it may be, it still is something fun to see. We were seated and the table was wiped, though sticky all the same.  We had it wiped again, most likely with the same original cloth, though no proof of that, so it's only an opinion. You know you're in for a ""Denny's"" or ""Red Lobster"" type place when they show photos of the food on laminated menus.  That's ok, I suppose.  Again, I didn't expect Morton's or Ruth's Chris Steak House.  Our waiter was on the slow side.  Sure there was a full bar area, though with the 3 wait staff, I would expect a ""little"" priority in service.  Now, I had water, so I was o.k. for a beverage while I awaited my double Jim Beam. Here's the depressing note... If you are a man (or woman) who enjoys a drink, we know a ""double neat"" means a glass nearly half full (at an absolute minimum).  Not here.   The bartender measures each pour, as I observed, precisely.  She could have been a scientist making a solution of explosives with the exactitude in her pours.   My double came ($12) and it was no more than a single ANYWHERE ELSE on Island.  I assumed it was a mistake or oversight and poured a single.  I had fried cheese (deliciously precisely made, though could have used a lot more sauce.)  No complaint on the food.  Very delicious snacks. I ordered another double bourbon neat.  This time I watched and watched as the waiter never gave her the order.  He came to apologize and my scientifically measured drink was poured. I had to ask the waiter, ""Why are the drinks being so poorly made?""  He said, ""That's the way she is"".  I see, I said.  She is allowed freedom to screw patrons.  A beer would have been the way to go, in retrospect. So, here's my advice:   Enjoy the appetizers.  They are fun and affordable.  Two ""$$"" signs on prices.  Stay away from the hard liquor. Four ""$$$$"" on their price and quantity.  I paid TWENTY FOUR ($24) for two exact measures of bourbon twice.  I could buy a NEW, FULL bottle of their bourbon of choice, Jim Bean (white label), for $11 at the local grocery store (Times), which I do. The staff are young and therefore unknowledgeable of ""where to go"" and ""what to do"" in the area.  I can blame that on youth.   Please, if you're looking for a BEER Happy Hour, then this is the place to go.  If you want a beverage or liquor, go somewhere else.  You will pay an OUTRAGOUS fee for thimbles of drink. Pay head to these words of wisdom.  Enjoy your Happy Hour.  Oh, if I recall, it begins early, somewhere around 2pm.  Want an early beer, go here. Cheers mate!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=280

I always get emails from Chili's with coupon deals and have never had any problems redeeming them before. On August 15, I got an email from Chili's that said ""Triple Dipper only $9.99 for a limited time""  Since my friends and I always eat the Triple Dipper this was a GREAT deal.  So after work on August 16, we went to the Waikele Chili's. We were given the menu with their current specials & it said that the Tripler Dipper was $12.99 for a limited time. We asked our server about the $9.99 email & she said that people have been asking about the $9.99 prices all day, but that they do not participate in that offer.  We even showed her the email and said that NO WHERE on the email did it say, participating locations only (or something similar to that).   She said that they are a franchise and so they don't participate.  She said that only the Waikiki location was participating in that offer.  We were irked, but didn't push it any further.  We ordered 4 of the Triple Dippers and then when we got our bills, we were charged $13.99 each. When we asked about the incorrect price, she told us that $13.99 was the price. We said why does your menu say $12.99? She said that it was ringing up as $13.99 and she didn't think there was any specials going on, but she would check with her manager. She came back & said that there was a special and it was $12.99 and that she would change our checks. She said she just thought that the menu was wrong. H E L L O !!

C.

Tracie F.,"Redondo Beach, Los Angeles, CA",352,690,57,4.0,3/20/2012,"I always find it hard to rate chain restaurants. For the most part the food is generally consistent as is the service. Sometimes the servers (and restaurant in general) have a bad day and I find it really hard to give a restaurant a poor rating based on an ""off"" day. This rating is an average of a number of visits.  Generally staff is pretty friendly and the service is usually on point. I have never been here when an item was not available. The restaurant is usually pretty clean as is the bathroom. One thing I really like about this location is the fact that they tend to honor mainland deals more than the other Chili's (namely Kapolei). I will not even start my rant about businesses that do not honor deals in Hawaii. Overall, this is a pretty decent chili's. There are not a whole lot of eating options in the Waikele area so if you are going to dine while bargain hunting, I recommend that you do it here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=280

Kiichi R.,"Waipahu, HI",190,154,114,3.0,1/6/2014,"Real Rating: 3.5 stars. First off, NO MORE PARADISE PIE!?!?! WTF CHILI'S!? You heard me right, the paradise pie is no longer offered. Replaced by some pan-cooked cookie with ice cream. Decent alternative, but no where near a worthy replacement. Moving on, for this specific location: I've been here dozens of times over the past decade or so. It's affordable, staff has generally been great, and the wait time has been fairly reasonable as well. Food is what you pay for, and portions aren't undersized. I feel its a very worth family-restaurant. Problems with this location is that it gets extremely packed during any rush time. I would say venture to Kapolei or the lesser visited Pearlridge if you must dine at Chili's.

The lunch special that catches my eyes is the unlimited soup and salad.  Sounds intriguing, but I look over the menu again just to make sure.  Hey, what do ya know, Chilis serves chili!  Thats interesting, and they serve it ""local style"".  Sounds interesting, the chili and sticky rice combination, so I go for it as an add on to the soup and salad special.  It doesnt disappoint, but at the same time it doesnt win me totally over.  The salad was fresh out of a bag, but without the plastic bag taste and one BIG patter of chips and salsa, which were really tasty in my opinion.

Jessica-Nicole U.,"Honolulu, HI",1794,253,1103,4.0,5/10/2012,"So what can I really say about this restaurant that makes it a four star? I mean, it's hard to rate Chili's anything below a three anyways since they have such good food, and from my experience thus far, great service, at every restaurant I've been to. I think the restaurant in Mililani is much nicer with a great waiting area outside and just somehow a nicer ambience inside.  But this place deserves four stars because I've always had excellent service, no problem with parking and the food always came out right. Never had a bad or irritable time with anything. Temperature's about right too which matters a lot in my book. Very smooth... in and out... but I must say... I have no clue how this place is when it's super packed because I've never been here when it's really packed. I think I've been here overall of 8 times, so maybe it's the less busier Chilis?  Of course the food is great, but not much different from other Chili's food. My food always comes out fresh and sizzling/hot/cold. So not problem with that. And I don't think I've ever had to wait.... Why not 5 stars? Ehhh... it's not perfect... it could be better. The bathroom's all the way on the right side in the back... kind of sucks for those all the way on the left side... and it's not very ""chill"" near the bar area since the restaurant entrance just seems so RIGHT THERE.

The server was completely unfamiliar with any of the alcoholic drinks on the menu. Who doesn't know what's in a sangria? It was awful. When we wanted to pay the bill, the server messed up one of our checks. Instead of apologizing, she snatched our credit cards and receipts and left us not knowing what was going on. After 20 minutes we went to the kitchen to find out what was going on. With 5 servers plus the manager huddled behind the POS system, they still couldn't figure out how to fix the checks. The manager completely threw his employee under the bus and still didn't even apologize for the inconvenience.

They made him pay for his rice seperately and he paid for the extra onions seperately...okaaay Thing is he paid the main price for the fajitas. So he paid $20 just for minimal flank steak and some of the the onions on his plate. It wasnt much. They didnt even give him any of the sides.

(I ate at the Red Lobster in Waikiki once and everything about it was horrible and nothing like any of the Red Lobsters I've been to on the mainland.) What really ticks me about this Chili's is that my credit card was charged $2 more than the total I put down. I did call the store and they said it was a mistake. I don't see how it could be a mistake, but guess maybe give them the benefit of doubt....? They said they'll send it to home office in California and the $2 will be credited back... we'll see. My advice - if you use a credit card, make sure to check that what gets billed is correct (there's another Yelp review below with a $10 overcharge - and how many people will bother to check and then write about it????) The food was a huge disappointment: didn't know what to order as first time here - but I did the Chicken bacon ranch quesadilla. It was dry. Horrible. Partner did spicy grilled shrimp taco - it was better, but not enough sauce, rice not good, and the main ingredient - the shrimp - not good quality.

On top of that was the chicken, topped with cheese, tortilla strips and some tomato mix.  It also came accompanied with a little dish of black beans and some ""mexican"" rice.  The triple dipper was okay, the the boneless chicken wings did not look like the picture and came with a honey mustard sauce and according to my friend it wasnt as crispy as before.  The buffalo wings were okay too, nothing special, and the tiny dish of the dip was pretty good but came topped with a lot of Parmesan cheese.  As for dessert we got their new red velvet molten cake with the molten part being a cream cheese center and topped with vanilla ice cream and a chocolate shell.  It was good and delicious, the outer cake part was a bit dry but of course, towards the middle it was very good and moist.  Overall, food is pricey for what you get but just like service, it is just okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=360

She brings us our sodas and that is the last we see of her until the bill comes. Our glasses were empty longer than they were full and we would had to ask other servers to help us with a refill.

The waitress sort of apologized and offered me another rack but both of our moist versions were just the same. Really really dried out. They had covered it in bbq sauce to attempt to moisten it it seems but it was revolting! The meat was dried and we really had to work hard to get it off the bone. False advertising here Im afraid. Tried to make our way through the rack hoping that the end of it only was tough but stopped half way, it was a big let down.

The burger was cooked good, but the elements all together did not mesh. The maple bacon was too sweet to be eaten with the tangy sauce. For some reason, the lettuce was shredded, like the ones from Mickey D's. I mean, if I wanted mediocre lettuce, I would have went there. Our server took forever to check up on us.

We just kept waiting. and waiting. and waiting. until finally she showed up to check up on us again, but this time my friends and I were smart.

Classic burger was huge and cooked and done to her liking. Chicken tacos were SMALL and SUPER SAD looking. No sauce and very small pieces of chicken... it was just dry and she said it had no flavor and was nor worth $14. My burger was supposed to be medium but came out WELL DONE (eek!) but I was hungry so I didn't send it back... also I HATE onions and had read on the menu that it doesn't come with onions, but just to be on the safe side I asked the server and she confirmed it didn't come with onions... but of course it came out to me with onions. YUCK! I seriously woulda sent it back but I was SO hungry and my friend with the sad looking tacos wanted the onions lol.  Dessert: molten chocolate cake and red velvet style molten cake. I didn't care for the red velvet cake but they loved it. The molten chocolate cake was BOMB!  I still don't like this location and based on my last 3 visits I definitely won't be returing. Mililani and Pearlridge have waaaaay better service and the quality of the food is waaaaaaay better!

Teresa G.,"Honolulu, HI",216,52,3,1.0,12/15/2013,We came here for lunch today and all I can say is the food made us all sick to our stomachs literally.  I think it was the artichoke dip that we ordered as an appetizer but didn't get until after our meal came. The vomiting and  diarrhea have not stopped since an hour after we ate!  We will NEVER eat at this restaurant ever again!!!  I urge everyone not to eat here unless you enjoy getting sick.  The next call I will be making is to the health department tomorrow morning.  If I could give minus stars for this restaurant I would.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=340
Grant S.,"Waipahu, HI",1318,232,1025,5.0,12/7/2010,"*Update:  Just ate at Chili's tonight and had Carl K. as our server.  Best server ever.  Good timing, friendly, thoughtful.  As we finished up our meal he brought a strawberry lemonade in a take-out cup instead of a glass.  Keep up the good work! Whoa, I don't know whats with all the hatin on this Chili's location but I'm definitely a fan.  Located in busy busy Waikele parking can be kinda confusing but I promise you will find a spot even if its way down by Old Navy. I will outline my genuine liking of this restaurant in comparison to restaurants like it.  First Chili's has quite a few solid options that makes it a keeper.   The chicken crispers are by and far my favorite meal at chili's.   The medium bodied batter around tender chicken strips and fantastic honey mustard sauce makes it my kinda gal.  Can I get it with white rice? Yes.  Does it come with a corn on the cob to feign a shred of healthfulness?  Yes.  What does Outback have compared this this?  Alice Springs Chicken? Meh. Too much cheese and too oily (and more expensive).  Zippy's?  Nope.  Big City? Negative. The next ""money"" choice is the sampler platter.  First off you choose what you want on it from a list of appetizers.  Southwest eggrolls?  Superb.  Chicken crispers?  Whoa these again? YES PLEASE. Boneless wings, regular wings, you name it.  Order this sucker with a side of rice and BAM dinner with variety. One of their long running promotions is the $20 dinner for two.  Such a good deal.  You split an appetizer (the texas cheese fries are money in the bank) and each get an entree from a special list.  But the real question is, is the chicken crispers entree on this list?  YOU BET IT IS. I'm tired of mediocre honey mustard, thank you Chili's. The burgers are actually really really good.  The bun is something to be desired and the burger is more or less cooked to your liking.  The star of the burger though is the bacon.  Whoever makes their bacon is a genius.  None of your Bar-S store bought junk is a pack.  This is thick cut, savory, smoky bacon. Good job Chili's, sorry people hate on you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=340
Norm G.,"Honolulu, HI",156,493,139,2.0,1/7/2009,"Why, oh why don't I learn to stuff myself before I go shopping with my family in Waikele?  Or just head on down to a local Japanese restaurant in Waipahu before the blood sugar heads south, and I lose all rationality about what should be consumed?!  Not long ago, we stumbled in here after shopping too long, and we were famished!  Normally, when the family is starving, we will eat anything in sight and think it's great.  However, this was not the case at Chili's Waikele. Wherefore, thou asketh, doth thou thumb thy nose at this bastion of culinary delight?  I will enumerate as follows: One: The scullery maid had such an angry countenance and demeanor, it would surely frighten such a one as Vlad the Impaler; Two:  The victuals were cooked to such a degree, leaving no moisture therein, wherefore there was great danger that they would lodge permanently in the esophagus, had I not a big stoup of root beer at the ready; Three: The music, if it could be called such, which emanated from speakers in the dining hall, was played with such amplification as to risk rupturing the tympanic membranes of our delicate ears.

Emiko T.,"New York, NY",279,329,100,4.0,11/4/2010,"While we all know that Chili's is the quintessential chain restaurant that has the potential to gross us out with their C grade food and oily spinach artichoke dip, in a pinch Chili's seriously can hit the spot! Therefore I'm reviewing based on the awesome service we had when we walked in 30 minutes before closing time.  We were seated and served by a really enthusiastic waitress who I suspect might be the manager and hence the stellar service. If she's faking her happiness and is in fact putting her game face on throughout the entire night then she seriously deserves that position. Either that or she could really love working for the company that's notorious for the catchy ""I want my baby back baby back baby back baby back...""  Ordered a sampler appetizer with buffalo wings, spinach and artichoke dip and the southwestern eggrolls.  Yeah, it's horrible for your arteries. Let's not even critique the food. It is what it is: a heart attack waiting to happen in 20 years. Although I must say the blackberry iced tea was delicious.  I wish I got the name of our server but she really made the dining experience enjoyable and the food taste that much better. Also, on Friday and Saturdays they're open until 11 which is more than most restaurants on the island can say!

Brian A.,"Honolulu, HI",35,892,723,3.0,10/21/2010,"Unfortunately, this review is a bit skewed because I'm on a special diet and cannot partake in all the great stuff that makes burger restaurants so bad for us (see mainly french fries on this trip). Although what was good is that they were able to adjust our order, so we could stay within our diet plan and eat one of their burgers (Atkins style). You see, when I usually go to a Chili's it's mainly about the Mushroom Swiss Burger (not sure of the exact name), but it's money. Our waitress looked really young (compliment) and handled everything well since we had all this modifications and such. Although at the end, with my sad look on my face from having the french fries gone uneaten, she said, ""Oh, we could have got you vegetables instead!""  ""That's okay."" I said, thinking that the vegetables would probably be tossed in butter, thus nullifying their nutritional value to our health and current diet.

I will give a short review of what I ate. I have been dying to eat Mexican food so I ordered enchiladas and chicken quesadillas.  Surprisinly...I was shocked how much food it was and the taste.  All of it was very flavorable even the side dishes that were the black beans and rice.  It was so good that I somehow ate it all.  What I am sad about Chili's Hawaii is that they are not having the all you can eat enchillada meal that the States are advertising.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=80

Keisha B.,"Kaneohe, HI",294,155,192,3.0,9/6/2015,"Overpriced. Oh Chili's, why do you always make me spend so much money? After taking a break from shopping at the Waikele Outlets, Caitlyn G. and I decided to grab a quick bite at the conveniently located Chili's. We figured its mid-day, there should be a happy hour with some great deals. Well there is, but only M-F (3-6) - today was Saturday.  So, we arrive and were seated right away. Great. We were pleasantly greeted by our server Tim. He was a great server and I was very impressed. We looked over the drinks menu and I ordered the Grapefruit Margarita (sounds amazing right?) and Caitlyn ordered the Blueberry Pineapple Margarita. It really bothers me that there is no prices on their drink menu. Why do they not put prices on there? Oh yes, because the drinks are completely over priced. We payed ~$12-13 for our margs and they were about 16oz. Ugh. We checked in on Yelp and got the free chips and queso/salsa. SCORE. The menu has a lot more choices and a variety of choices than the last time I visited. It is completely overwhelming but I am extremely pleased they offer more vegetarian items. They have a blackbean burger that you can substitute on any of their burgers.  I ordered the Quesadilla Explosion Salad. I have always loved this salad but hate ordering it and paying $13 when I don't get the chicken. Tim was so nice when I told him I didn't want the meat and he asked if I wanted avocado instead. YES! I was so happy, this was the first time that I actually had someone ask (at Chilis) if I wanted something substituted because I don't eat meat. A+ Tim!  We also ordered fried pickles and the sampler with fried cheese, buffalo wings (for Caitlyn) and spring rolls. The buffalo wings were below average. The friend pickles were great.  We ended our meal by splitting the check on their Zoisk. This thing is great! No more waiting for your bill! Just pay it on the Zoisk! Want to play games, pay $1.99 to play on the Zoisk. Want to order drinks - do it on the Zoisk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=80

He immediately took our drink order while we browsed the menu and scrolled through the electronic ""ziosk.""  ""Checking in"" on yelp gave us a free chips, queso and salsa appetizer, which was just delicious. For my meal, I ordered my usual- the triple sampler appetizer with my selection of sliders, southwest egg rolls, and instead of the loaded potato wedges, I opted to try the cheese bites. -Queso Dip: rich creamy cheese with browned seasoned beef mixed in. secretly my favorite part of the meal -Salsa: diced tomatoes, onions, and cilantro had good flavor and was very mild, suitable for ""non spicy"" eaters. -Chips: fresh and plentiful, our server even offered a refill! -Sliders (2): perfect sized burger, patty cooked medium well with onions and bacon bits inside. Yum! -Southwest Egg Rolls (2 cut in half): shredded chicken, black beans, and corn mixture, wrapped and deep fried. This comes with an avocado ranch dipping sauce.  -Cheese Bites: little pieces of mozzarella, lightly breaded and deep fried. These were a little too salty for my liking but I ate them anyway, dipping them in the queso! The ""ziosk"" was so convenient and easy to use, showing pictures and descriptions of popular menu items as well as games to purchase and options for paying your tab. It offers to split checks and calculates tip when paying with a credit/debit card, cash customers pay their tab through the server.. so ""old school"" for this high tech world :) Although we had ""ziosk"" as a second server, Tim was always around and did check in with us periodically.

We ordered margaritas anyway, and because the prices weren't on the menu, the server gave us estimates (that were completely off by a lot lol).  The food I ordered was not hot, at all. I've heard they microwave their food which I'm starting to believe now because my food was barely Luke warm. The service was 4 stars, the guy was attentive, nice, professional, and always checking up on us. The food quality and not honoring a promotional thing they were holding was why I gave 2 stars.
