Ashley R.,"Washington, DC",175,51,121,4.0,7/30/2017,"You don't go to Chili's expecting a fine dining experience. It's a chain with a lot of options, and you go with that expectation.  That being said, me and my friends had a great experience for dinner last night - primarily due to our awesome waiter DJ. He was attentive, accommodating, and helpful. One of my friends is pregnant and asked about a virgin daiquiri. While he said they do not have those on the menu, he personally went to see what he could do and came back with one for us. Great service!  Food wise - my Tito's margarita was really good, as was my guacamole burger. From my friends reviews, the fajitas were good (but the steak was overlooked). I would definitely come back here - for DJ specifically!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf
Latoya M.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",0,7,9,2.0,1/14/2018,"Ordered the baby back ribs and fries. They came out pretty much room temp or heat lamp temperature definitely not straight from the grill. The service was just ""ok"" I had to flag down the server each time we needed a drink refill (3 in total)  or the sauces she didn't bring out with the food. Desert (chocolate molten cake) tasted like it was stale... I wasn't a fan. With all that said, it'll be a while before I visit this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf
Rachel B.,"La Plata, MD",52,40,7,5.0,6/4/2017,"Great experience at Chilis today. My fiancé and I did the $35 deal that comes with 2 meals, appetizer, 2 margaritas and a big dessert! The waiter with dreads was our server and he was so nice and polite! Was full and happy at the end. Thank you for giving out roses to all the ladies on Mother's Day too!  Came again (June 4th) and once again, great service and lots of delicious food. Thank you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf
Deborah F.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",1,3,1,1.0,8/26/2017,The service was poor.  When the server arrived by the name of Anthony when ask why it took so long he stated he was washing dishes.  He was rude and we left.  If you have an hour to wait on service once seated at a table this is the place to you.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf
J D.,"White Plains, MD",0,20,,1.0,10/9/2017,"Have been to this location several times.  The food is always good and we've had good service in the past.  However, the last few times we've been here the service has dropped off big time.  The last 2 times in particular we've had the same server and she is just horrible at her job.  I hate to be that blunt,  but she's just bad and it appears that she's not even trying.  Last time we were here , the hostess had to go get her after we'd been sitting for 6 or 7 minutes and she hadn't come out yet.  Then she disappeared for long stretches and would eventually come by, smelling of cigarette smoke.  We asked for extra chips for our queso and she didn't bring them until we were done with our meals.  All this and she only had 2 tables.  This time was much the same experience.  I had to go to the bar to get refills on our drinks after sitting on empty for 10 minutes.  It truly is the worst service I can remember getting in a restaurant.  I was frankly stunned to see she was still working here. We will not be coming back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf

Tameka Y.,"Bryans Rd, MD",100,18,12,1.0,4/28/2017,Not a good happy hour spot. Absolutely the worse service ever! Food was decent. Drinks were watered down.

Danielle M.,"Bushwood, MD",172,9,19,3.0,2/10/2016,"I decided to go to Chili's Happy Hour in Waldorf, MD because of the great happy hour prices. Chili's Happy Hour is Mon-Fri from 2pm-8pm (BAR ONLY) which is a great because it gives you more of a open window. I have been here 3 times so far for the happy hour. The first two times were cool. I was able to get a good seat and was pleased with my visit. When it comes to bar food, it is pretty much idiot proof unless you chef/cooks are just plan inexperienced. The food is nothing to celebrate over but it's good enough to help coat your stomach for the alcohol. The servers are cool but, overworked. Apparently today, the server on staff is by himself and overwhelmed. I walked in the bar today to a packed house with about 2-3 cocktail tables. I had to ask the host to clean a table off for me in a corner section of the bar. He was pleasant and didn't hesitate. My server, not sure what his name is because he never introduced himself, was running all over the place. I sat down at 6:11pm and I took about 7 mins for him to give me a menu, which I told him I knew what I wanted. I order the wings(fried hard), a glass of red wine and a margarita for later.  The kitchen was pretty fast because by 6:29 I had my food. Piping Hot! So word of advice, let your wings sit alittle. My margarita came and I forgot to tell my speedy Gonzalez server no salt around the rim. Once again I wasn't asked, which I'm used too. So I asked if they could make another? He offered to wipe the rim off instead of making a new one. I told him that regardless some salt ended up in the glass and I will taste it. He kind of looked at me like it was a issues but called the manager on his little walkie talkie and said ""I need the Margarita to come off"" then, he said loud enough for me to hear ""No! It's not our fault"". I'm like WTF? Broadcast? When he returned I had a margarita in a DRITY GLASS. Then, the restaurant cleared, my server disappeared.  The only reason I am not giving Chili's a 2 star is because of my pervious two visits. I will try again but and reevaluate if my next experience is better.

Sarah M.,"Greenbelt, MD",0,11,,1.0,7/28/2017,"I had lunch at chili's for the first time ever, that was my first and last time there.

Amanda T.,"Decatur, AL",0,8,5,1.0,3/11/2017,"My family and I have been here twice in a month and have walked out both times before being seated. 3:40 on a Saturday, tables empty and being told the wait will be 5-10 minutes. 10 minutes later still not being set. Seeing other customers sitting at their tables with empty drinks and coming up to the desk to ask when they will be waited on. Seems to me the management does not have their restaurant in order.

Mattie B.,"Sacramento, CA",11,4,,1.0,3/23/2017,Went in to Chili's to get some lunch. Was very hungry after a long morning. Had a long discussion with about four different people... at least two were managers... about why I was ordering just a burger and no sides. After they finally figured that out (I just ordered a burger with tomato and lettuce) we waited for about a half an hour before we got the order. There was cheese on it. It was cooked to well done. I walked out. I went to Five Guy's instead. Waited 6 minutes and had a perfectly done burger that did not betray my fructose intolerance. What a waste of time at Chili's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf
Will N Shirlisa C.,"Walkersville, MD",9,24,1,3.0,2/7/2017,"We went to chillis for dinner and the food, waiter AJ was on point. We got there between 8:45 & 9:00pm and we were having a really nice dinner until your staff that was hanging out at the take out pick up area decided to have a loud conversation. My wife and I could not even hear ourselves speaking to each other because they were so loud! AJ came by to check on us and asked if we needed anything else and we told him no but the people back there are really loud and he said he would relay the message but I guess they were not happy after they got the message and got even louder. One lady started loudly expressing after she obviously got her new work schedule, awww hell nawww, awww hell nawww I ain't working no weekends, I mean really!!!! A new staff is what you need Chilli's because these grown folks that was working need some taming in a bad way. One girl on staff made sure as she was leaving to yell at everyone Goodbye yall. My feelings on that is, if you had feelings about me saying you were to loud then you should have stopped by my table and we could  have handled it right there on the spot instead of walking out the door yelling and getting in your mother's van that came to pick you up. Your staff is rude besides AJ who handled us professionally. Thank you AJ and Chilli's you don't have to worry about seeing us anymore you ruined our quick anniversary outting!!!! The 3 stars you see is for AJ and the food and because of them I didn't give you one star for great parking!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf
Aly B.,"Hollywood, MD",0,1,,1.0,2/19/2017,Had the most disrespectful waiter ever. My mother asked if they had anything on the menu involving noodles since she has never been to a chili's before and the waiter told her she needed to go to another restaurant.

Katy R.,"Waldorf, MD",111,259,277,2.0,2/16/2016,"We came here last night at around 10:30. The menu isn't really my type, I guess it's kind of Tex mex? I never knew that about chilis. Anyway, me and the fiance shared the 2 for $20. They don't have many good choices for appetizers so we got fried pickles, which make me nauseous thinking about them. I got a 6 oz steak with mashed potatoes and salad, i finished the steak but didn't really touch anything else. Staff was nice, but the food isn't great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf
Tam J.,"Washington, DC",7,85,19,2.0,6/28/2016,"SLOW SLOW SLOW...Did I say slow?  Went there twice in a week.  First visit on a Monday and we sat in the bar area and saw a waiter 10 minutes later.  ""We have to ""FIND"" your server??? There were probably 8 other tables dining and two other tables in the bar area with seated patrons.  First, why do you need to FIND my server?  This spells poor management PERIOD.  Servers should have designated areas and help out in other areas when the need arises.  So, finally we had a server and he was nice (seems most area nice).  The food came out and was ok. Can't mess up fajitas and a drink.  We saw the server far and few during this visit.   Came back again on a Saturday. Sat down at 2:00 in the bar area (no one was in the front so we seated ourselves).  Finally after seeing no servers we were about to get up and get menus when a server arrived at our table. We placed our drink order (water and an iced tea as well as a margarita).  Ten minutes (2:10) later we placed our food orders, after the server took orders of tables that came in after us, yes, we needed a few minutes to look at the menu but when he finally returned, he should have taken our order first.  At 2:40 our food arrived...2:40...a salad and fajitas......totally unacceptable, as again, there were about 6-8 tables being served in the entire restaurant at the time of our visit. Why did it take 30 minutes for our food?  I ended up cancelling the margarita with the server who looked bewildered...but evidently he never put the order in or it was never sent to the table, either way...unacceptable. There also was a big disparity in the fajitas. We ordered the same dish on our prior visit and the quantity in no way compared to what we received this visit. The kitchen was throwing a loud party on Saturday, which I assume is why the food took so long coming out and was plentiful.?? Doubt I will go back here again.  Management really needs to step up to the plate on this place, I am sure they see the horrible reviews. Will also be sending this review to corporate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf?start=20

Once our waitress showed up, there was no introduction, it was simply ""what do you want to drink."" We also gave her our entire order figuring who knows how long it would be till we saw her again. She delivered our drinks and disappeared before I realized she brought the wrong thing. We didn't see her again until our meal came out. She dropped the food and disappeared before we even realized that we didn't have silverware.

I've been to this place a few times, but these last two times gave me the blues!  The wait staff were very nice and attentive when they were at the table, but it was the quality of the food & the dishes that the food was served on was what made us leave! So the first disappointment was getting our drinks, yes that's right we didn't even make it passed that, we ordered a glass of sprite and some hot tea.  They were brought out to us w/a smile!  It was when I got ready to take a sip when I realized what I did, the hot tea cup had lipstick stains on it, and the sprite had black floating debris in it!!  So I called the waiter to take it away and bring us another of both... he returned and this time the tea cup had a hair floating in it!!  At this point my husband was fed up and said look I can't sit here in confidence thinking that the food will be any better, if bringing us a CLEAN cup and a drink w/out mold/dirt in it was an issue; with that being said we left! I decided to go back w/a friend this time and see if it was maybe just that day that things were off... WRONG!  This time my friend ordered and when it was brought to her it seemed like the food was literally made on the plate and given to her all sloppy then you could see where they didn't even try to combine the seasonings in it & when she still decided to try it and see how it was she ended up spitting it back out immediately, they had put in too much hot spices so it made the dish inedible.  They did send the manager over and asked if it would be ok for them to make her another plate to replace that one she agreed to it, that one was much better, but it just seemed like it was a frozen dish that was microwaved and they sprinkled some seasoning on top...SMH.  It's unfortunate because we really liked going to Chilli's, I'm not goin to this one ever again!  & if you decide to go on your own, Good LUCK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf?start=20

How do you screw that up? I had California grilled chicken flatbread. I couldn't find a flavor other than salty and greasy.

Sal G.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",19,76,125,3.0,8/3/2014,"On this particular day recently I just felt like eating fajitas so I stepped on in. The place wasn't busy at all but the girl who brought me over the menu told me it would be a wait of like 35-40 mins for fajitas. I really couldn't be arsed so I ended up going for a burger instead. It was the usual alright quality but it was a sloppy second considering I really wanted a sizzling plate full of chicken and beef fajitas.  In the end the burger was tasty and the fries were not just warm for a change. Two beers rounded out this wee pit stop quite nicely and I left a satisfied chap that early afternoon. I couldn't figure out why it would have taken the kitchen so long to bring out certain food if the place was pretty dead. It was disappointing, almost as much as the table I was led to on arrival. Possibly the vestiges of the previous night's last patron; the last waiter/waitress could have easily followed Mr Miyagi's ""wax on, wax off"" self-help advice, as it would've certainly come in handy. I've been here a few times now, and this was probably the first time I had slightly below-par service.

I walked in and stood at the area where the hostess checks in guests. The hostess never made eye-contact or greeted me and my guest. We stood there and continued to look at her, she never looked at us or acknowledged us and we were standing directly in front of her. Then someone who looked like he could be a manager asked me and my guest to excuse him as he was trying to walk in the path we were standing in, never dawned on him to ask if we were assisted yet, clearly greeting customers as they arrive is not a priority, but we patiently stood there for 5 minutes, even after that happened. It was about 2pm in the afternoon, and there were empty tables, so it wasn't a matter of a busy lunch rush, after five more minutes my guest and I left and enjoyed a great meat at a place walking distance away. Hopefully their other locations have better customer service than this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf?start=40
Mattie C.,"Suitland, MD",48,5,,2.0,12/16/2013,The food was ok.  But the service was REALLY slow! The restaurant was only moderately busy and it took about 30min to get our food. Our waitress never came by to refill our waters and when it came time to pay she gave us attitude when we asked how the pay at the table POS system worked.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf?start=40
Michiko S.,"Waldorf, MD",4,13,23,2.0,2/16/2015,"I never had Chili's ever so the family and I decided to enjoy the experience together. The wait to be seated was not long at all. However, we did not see our waiter for quite some time before we even got to order our drinks. The wait for our appetizers alone was terrible. Once our entree had arrived the experience was beginning to crumble even more. They messed up the order of my meal and a family members salad were brown on the tips. Overall, I will not be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf?start=40
Adam B.,"Laramie, WY",142,27,5,1.0,12/16/2014,"The wait for a slow night to get our food was ridiculous, but that isn't the reason I'm writing this bad review. I have been up all night with food poisoning from the chicken crispers and have no desire to return ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf?start=40

K D.,"Washington, DC",2,14,6,3.0,5/22/2013,Nice place for food and drinks. The staff is a little slower and the workers and waiters are loudddddd in the kitchen.  Cheers to the bartenders.  The rest needs to be more customer service driven.   Thanks Kod,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf?start=40
Rick P.,"Waldorf, MD",0,1,,2.0,7/25/2015,"Despite all the bad reviews, I decided to try it anyway since I knew what to expect. Wasn't disappointed.  Even tho the place wasn't crowded, it still took too long for service. Was going to order an appetizer when the waitress took my drink order but she flew off to her next table before I could get a word out. So I ordered the appetizer when she took my meal order, and it came out after my meal (59 mins later). Every time the waitress came by, she'd say she'd check on in, but in the end I just had them take it back and make it to go. The food taste was marginal to OK compared to other Chili's. I doubt I will return to this one even for a to go order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf?start=40
Jane W.,"Fort Washington, MD",0,17,,3.0,7/1/2015,The taco tasted like sloppy joe mix and the tostada was like thin cardboard. My knife was dirty and the table machine didn't give me a receipt as requested. The waiter was polite and did bring me a clean knife and kept my drink filled. This used to be a good restaurant with consistent food. What on earth happened?!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf?start=40
Brian F.,"San Antonio, TX",39,387,199,2.0,4/2/2013,"I've never really been impressed here.  The service is okay at best and the food is average.  I like their table POS systems though, that's nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf?start=40
Ed C.,"Cheltenham, MD",0,19,,2.0,10/1/2013,"Had lunch today.  Ordered a ""Triple Combo"" to share and a bowl of chili.  My wife had a plate of nachos.  We also ordered iced tea -- $5.18!  That was a bit much for a couple of glasses of tea.  The combo had southwestern egg rolls -- not bad, spinach dip -- just as good as out of a jar, and boneless honey-chipotle wings -- pretty much flavor free.  The chili -- way too much cumin and way to little meat.  Pretty disappointing for a place that call's itself ""Chili's"".  Maybe it's named after a fat guy who shivers a lot.  The chili was more like soup.  The service was good.  Our server was attentive but did not hover. Of course, Waldorf is pretty much a wasteland as far as decent food goes.  So, I'm sure Chili's is at the top of the list for plenty of the locals.  I'll stay home when I'm in the mood for chili or open a can.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf?start=40
Leroy R.,"District Heights, MD",16,4,4,2.0,6/17/2012,"The service is always good, however I am not sure if it's just me but I like the atmosphere at Fridays over chili's. If I was'nt hungry and just wanting food I might have gone to Mcdonald's and get a big mac and some fries. It could have been an off day for them but I call it like I see it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf?start=40
Jess B.,"Waldorf, MD",12,61,7,4.0,12/2/2012,"Fun place to be! The staff is really friendly and if there is an issue they do their best to fix it. Mondays are great, with twice the serving of fajitas for the regular price and top shelf margaritas for $3. The sausage queso is utterly delicious and makes me want more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf?start=40
Elizabeth W.,"Brandywine, MD",3,7,2,1.0,5/8/2014,"My boyfriend and I decided to do an early dinner here since we found some unused gift certificates from Christmas. We usually don't eat at chain restaurants so we thought we would give it a try. The food wasn't great. I had the shrimp tacos that were bland and Em had a chicken sandwich. The service and management was awful. The waitress actually told us she forgot that we were her table. She forgot half out meal so our sides came 15 min after our entree. We didn't realize we had to use the pos system to pay and got attitude when we asked for our bill. I tried paying with the gift cards and the system wouldn't let me use them so I asked the waitress. She took then in the back and got the manager To try and help. She came back and said they wouldn't work but the manager could come over. Well it was an obvious struggle to get her to come because we watched her walking around aimlessly for 15 min before coming. She told me there was nothing she could do and would not honor them. I am 100% sure they have not been used and was offended by being accused of using blank gift cards. In the end we spent money we wouldn't have at a restaurant for average food, bad wait staff, and a terrible management. All corporate did was give us one free meal. That does not cover everything we spent money wise and I have no need to ever go back to that place!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf?start=40
Chris D.,"Fairfax, VA",17,280,114,3.0,3/6/2011,Standard Chili's Grill & Bar. Nothing fancy. The service is good and the prices affordable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf?start=40

Lyndell W.,"Newark, DE",25,42,3,2.0,8/23/2010,"My BFF and I decided to stop in for a quick bite to eat after shopping at Target. It was pretty late so I went inside to find out what time they closed. First of all the host(ess) was nowhere to be found so I wandered up to the bar to ask. What a lively crowd!!  By the time we parked the car and came back, there was the hostess who asked ""would you like to sit in the bar area?"" Immediately I replied ""no thank you  well take a quiet table -lol  our waitress was really nice  she did and said all the right things. Although when our food came out I had to wonder if their was a french fry shortage in the kitchen. At any rate, we had a great time catching up! One suggestion, that molten cake should have coconut sprinkled on it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf?start=40
