Justin L.,"Euless, TX",0,6,4,2.0,8/26/2017,"Place gets 2 stars because they don't know how to train the cook to make a steak, constantly order a 6oz sirloin medium well when we come here and guess what, it's constantly badly cooked, from bleeding out to dry and chewy, ridiculous for this to happen EVERY time I've been here in the last 2 months, it's like they just don't care that he is wasting these steaks, I'd have fired that cook and found a new one over all the wasted product! These are supposed to be medium well and the one on the bottom is clearly raw in the middle, mine is also raw In the middle.  Servers aren't usually a problem and overall the service is good but I'm tired of paying a place to cook the food wrong time and time again, oh, and it seems like a problem with the whole area as far as portions go, if someone orders a 6oz steak you need to cut a 7-8oz piece to make up for what gets cooked off. Edit: to further my point here I went ahead and weighed our steaks to show exactly what I am talking about. Pay for 6oz and get less than 4oz smh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-watauga
Ali L.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,20,,1.0,10/20/2017,"I wanted some salmon and got some. It was over $16 and it is so nasty!!!  The salmon has a funky taste to it, can't really figure out how to describe it.  I had this order to go, so I didn't have a real sit down experience.

I had a VISA gift card I was trying to pay with and the cashier kept telling me it was declined, but when I used it somewhere else, it worked fine so that was a bit annoying.

The burger was quite tasty. A bit smallish but eh, I got the new Skillet Smoked Potato Wedges to dig into while my daughter had the standard fries.  This is where the disappointment happened. I open the styrofoam container and low and behold... Nine (9) wedges. SERIOUSLY! NINE WEDGES!!! They are potatoes. The cheapest and most plentiful of the sides. I mean, do they come out of the employees pockets?! If you put more than nine wedges in there would you have to run a credit check on me?? Nine... That is just shameful. Ugh!

I laughed and replied, yeah right, it doesn't get any fresher than out of a bag.   We were the first to arrive for lunch, as door opened.   Went to wash hands before eating lunch and the ladies restroom completely reaked of urine.   Won't be returning.  Refuse to go to a place and be told we're not going to get anything fresher than it coming from a bag, heated up and served.   Gross!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-watauga

Jeremy A.,"Frisco, TX",5,14,,1.0,6/18/2016,Host was rude and did not acknowledge us as we walked in. She had her hand on her head and she just looked at us. She grabbed 2 menus and just walked away nit saying thus way or anything. Then put the menus on the table they were also dirty... she had thus pissy look on her face like it was a burden. But the second a manager comes to the front she is all of a sudden happy and chipper. Then they walk away back to her poor attitude. Just set the pace of the rest of the night. But Raygan saved the day she was sweet and very considerate we sat at table 51 at 643pm please let her know she was awesome and if she wants a job at my restaurant she has one.

Peyton W.,"Fort Worth, TX",77,78,51,3.0,6/27/2015,"We decided to have a simple date night at Chili's. Knowing that the North Richland Hills locations would probably be quite busy, we settled on this location. The food was pretty good, I had a cup of potato soup and that could have been life changing!! As an entree, I had the boneless buffalo chicken salad. It was a little watery, but decent. For my beverage, I had my favorite mango iced tea. It tasted more like watered down iced tea, than the delicious sweet mango taste I'm accustomed to. I'd come back to this location if and only if smoking wasn't allowed here. I had no idea smoking was allowed in restaurants?? It really bothers my allergies and although we weren't in the bar, you can still smell it. I left with a headache. Shoutout to our waiter, Jason...he was pretty nice.

Marcus W.,"Queen Creek, AZ",339,444,37,2.0,5/9/2014,"OK, it's a Chilis. Same menu, same prices, same layout. I like the new tableside tablets that allow a quick checkout, especially if you are dealing with impatient kids (or the service is poor). This trip, we had a nice server who was attentive and knew when to come to the table (really, it's a skill to know that!). The food, unfortunately, was pretty awful. Part of the meals were cold, and the textures were... off. I don't know why I come back to Chilis, wherever I am. Maybe it's the thought of knowing what I'll get, what to expect, etc. Oh, and this establishment allows smoking in the bar. Even though that section is ""closed off"" from glass walls- the smoke still seaps from the lobby area over to the non-smoking section. Lame! As a non-smoker I don't want to inhale second hand smoke while I eat my Chilis dinner! Will be staying away from this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-watauga?start=20
Latisha P.,"Fort Worth, TX",91,21,57,2.0,7/30/2015,"Blah at best. My family was looking at take out and didn't want the normal. We opted for to go from chilis. Three triple dippers was the choice. I only agreed to chilis because I could get the original chicken crispers. Apparently a wrong button push from ordering the app got me another kind of chicken crispers I didn't want. Again our mistake. As far as the food and presentation it was not good. We had 9 ranch dressing with deformed lids spill all over food. (No this was not rough handling on our part, the bag went directly to the seat and then to the table) every southwestern egg roll ordered was mushy. I almost had a heart attack that the three appetizers only cost almost $40! When I called to verify if the chicken crisper was a mistake on our part the gentleman was very friendly and apologetic so at least there was that. He offered to make the chicken crispers but I really didn't feel like loading back up and repeating the drive when my appetite was gone at that point. Only advice to offer the establishment is that presentation is everything especially When charging $40. I could of had much much nicer meals in that price range and had I known the cost before I probably would have selected a better place. Again my fault.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-watauga?start=20
Viralyn K.,"Fort Worth, TX",250,311,382,2.0,11/27/2013,"Very unimpressive in all aspects, but it's Chilis; your expectations shouldn't be high anyways.  We came in during a busy lunch, which I'm sure came as a surprise to them given it was a Monday during Thanksgiving break.  Service was standard. We got what we needed and that was that. The server did ""what's up"" me when I called for his attention. Food quality wasn't great but my expectations are low. The preparation was terrible - my bean burger burnt and dry (not how I remembered it back in the day), kids mac n chz all over the place, chips were very oily and flavorless, and my sister didn't eat her chicken tenders so one can only assume they were indeed yucky.

Cindy I.,"Fort Worth, TX",5,68,16,2.0,9/8/2015,"We went for dinner, my friend was craving their salmon. And I just wanted one of those fufu drinks chicks drink.  We came in the bar side as a gentleman opened the door for us.  Most bars of these type of restaurants have a fun easy atmosphere.  The part i like is the tv screens everywhere. Their were 5 people in the bar watching Rangers and having drinks when we walked in.  The waiter noticed us quickly and came over and took our order. He also made excellent suggestions on drinks and food.  As our food arrived it looked scrumptious.  I did as my friend if her salmon was burnt on the bottom. But she didn't seam to have a problem with however it was prepare.   Just as I cut into my burger with an onion ring bacon and bbq   Every person lite up at the same time. It was stove pipe and chimneys, Granny dont forget your pipe day.  My friend took 2 bites and said she was full. She blamed it in being a little under the weather. I ate the 4 rings and some of the burger. It would have been good or even better if I wasn't gaging smoke.  I just wish I had known this was a smoking joint. I know their aren't that many around. And there is a need for that.  Its not fair for those people to have to stand out side in the cold. I just wish I had known  before my food got there. Funny their were no ash trays on the tables, usually thats a good sign  So great food and service here but remember it is a smokers bar not a eating bar. Wouldn't it be nice if they made the rest of the dinning area as fun as the bar? Great place but my experience bad.  Both orders were small. I had 4 onion rings. The salmon looked like it shrunk on the grill.  Generous was not on the menu.   Cost 37 1drink, salmon,  1 burger   This is before the the tip was applied.

Both times when I have confronted the waiter about this, I'm treated as though it is my fault they told me the wrong price of a beer.

Tina W.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,18,6,1.0,1/11/2014,"Well now that I've calmed down after my visit on Monday January 6, 2014, I can finally write a review. Things started out good, no, they actually started off great. I didn't catch anyone's name during my visit so I'll have to use descriptors. The host was a youngish (maybe just out of high school but younger than me [25]? ) guy maybe 5'9""- 5'10"" with dark blondeish hair. He was excellent. Professional, competent, friendly. Things were off to a great start. The waiter, dark brown/black hair, maybe 5'11"", he seemed to be a decent waiter when the journey began, but by the end of the night I was in a literal rage spiral and he was part of the problem. So he takes our order, and me and my boyfriend did the 2 for $20 (share an appetizer, each get an entree). So we're waiting, and waiting, and finally we get our food! It wasn't too long, probably around 15 minutes, but the food is our entrees and not our appetizer? I told the food runner we didn't need the appetizer (because, duh) and I started in on my chicken covered with bacon and cheese (really very good by the way), macaroni and cheese (no, no, no and no) and broccoli. I've been to Chili's and had the broccoli COUNTLESS times, and it's always covered in some sort of very very light buttery type sauce and spices (unless I order it ""guiltless""). Well tonight the broccoli jumped off a crudités platter and straight onto my plate and skipped the steam basket!!! It was legit raw. My boyfriend had broccoli too and his was cooked and had the sauce and everything which was normal, but made it all the more odd that mine didn't have it. A manager appeared shortly after we got our food holding the appetizer and apologized about the timing and said it would be taken off the bill (again, because, DUH! you're not being the hero by not charging us for something we didn't receive/consume.) She then asked us if we would like to take it to go since it would just be going in the trash, we said OK. I appreciated that, but I do feel like this was the absolute least she could do (besides the obvious not charging us), but I also understand they're running a business, whatever. I told her about the broccoli and she was very polite about getting it replaced. We never had ANY contact with the waiter besides when he took our order, once when he refilled our drinks and said the appetizer would be out shortly, and when he cleared a few dishes from the table mid meal. He was however very present at a large group behind my boyfriend. So we're done, the experience was not the best, the waiter drops the bill off (never asked us once how the meal was, well, okay, sure, fine) which was $22.08. My boyfriend put down $30.00 and this guy brings back $7.90. So that means he brought us .02 less than we were entitled to and  I'm ALWAYS going to rage about waiters stealing change. It's the principle. When I told him he forgot some of our change he said he didn't have any pennies and produced a nickel?? So he had the money but he'd just rather us be out of .02 than him be out of .03? Unbelievable cherry on the proverbial cake. I started raging hardcore at that point and if I had been alone I would have found three pennies SOMEWHERE and gave him his change back and left without leaving a tip because if you steal from me you get no money but I think my sweet boyfriend tipped him, as measly as the tip may have been.

Joshua T.,"North Richland Hills, TX",99,84,,1.0,12/17/2012,"Been to this chili's twice and the service was awful both times. My latest venture to this chili's was horrid. The waiter was incredibly inept at his job that night. I ordered sweet tea, he brought unsweetened (and an unsweetened refill) my friend was drinking sprite, when he refilled it, he refilled it with water. My steak was rare and ice cold, I sent it back as I ordered a well done steak. Granted the restaurant was slightly busy, which our waiter kept reminding us that's why our experience was bad. Apparently he wasn't to busy to participate in signing happy birthday with half of the other waiters. It took about 20mins after we were done eating to even get a check printed. All together, we were there for just under an hour and half on a meal that should have taken 30-40mins.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-watauga?start=40
Corina T.,"Keller, TX",88,274,78,2.0,1/5/2011,Okay Chili's......Salt and Sugar? They're okay to use - NOT OKAY TO DOUSE EVERY DISH WITH. Me and the husband wanted a decent burger and it was late so we decided to settle for Chilis since it was close to the house. When we walked in it was thankfully not obnoxiously loud I got the Peppercorn burger and he got the Chicken crispers. I felt like getting a strawberry sugarwater - oops I meant lemonade - unfortunately it looked sparse on the strawberry and high on the sugar. I had to get a separate glass of water and pour some in to cut the sweetness. Once I got my burger - the patty was cooked fine but it really didnt have any actual peppercorn flavor. I should have probably gone with the classic chesseburge or a bacon cheese burger to get some actual flavor. Instead of fries I opted to get corn on the cob. The cob was cooked perfectly! Only downside? The dang salt. I swear that corn on the cob looked like winter wonderland with the amount off salt it had on it. Chilis your food would have been pretty decent - just lay off the salt and sugar. Please.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-watauga?start=40
Steve M.,"Keller, TX",39,218,36,2.0,1/2/2013,"Hadn't been by in a while but dropped in for Cobb Salad (no longer on menu but you can get without the eggs). Service was decent, music a bit loud and they forgot tomatoes on salad. And, despite moving into the center of the restaurant, the cigarette smoke wafted over and kept me from enjoying my meal. I rushed through as quickly as possible to leave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-watauga?start=40
Diana M.,"Watauga, TX",15,1,,3.0,12/5/2014,"Standard Chili's food. Service was great, however, you need to love the smell of cigarettes. Not-so-subtle wafts of smoke drift through the lobby leaving a pungent aroma on your clothes so that you can smell it the rest of the evening. I like Chili's food, however the overpowering smell of smoke left me slightly nauseous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-watauga?start=40
Jarrod J.,"Keller, TX",15,17,3,2.0,3/9/2013,"So, it's Chili's.  Not sure I need to say more.  But I did want to comment on the Chocolate Chip Pie.  That's my comment.  There are better places to go.  Chili's is one of those places that reminds me why I'm tired of food chains in America.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-watauga?start=40
Jeremy M.,"Fort Worth, TX",43,4,,4.0,6/25/2012,"Hey guys, when you review a place, know what you are talking about first.  The peppercorn burger hasn't been on the menu in years so it's not going to taste right.  Also, Chilis did away with bussers a while ago to save on labor cost, not every server can get to every table to wait on and clean.  Give them a break, they target the lowest demographic for business.  These waiters make $2.13 an hour with no raises, they get people that come in, order water and the 2 for $20 and tip 8-10%.   And you are wondering why the service isn't perfect or the food isn't stupendous.  My rule has always been, if you can't tip, don't go out.  This isn't just a part time while I go to school job for some of these guys.  They have families that they provide for and they get beaten down by the highest maintenance, most disrespectful customers around.  You get what you pay for, which at Chilis is 4-5 star worth.  Just thank your lucky stars that a place exists like Chilis where you can grab a burger and a beer for a decent price when you're broke.  They have a bottomless lunch meal where it costs roughly $8 to get bottomless soup salad and chips, wow! And you people complain about a few little things.  Be courteous of things you don't have full info on, and tip your waiters well.   And until you have something useful to say, stay off of yelp or urbanspoon, there is enough garbage jamming up the internet already.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-watauga?start=40
Lucy W.,"Keller, TX",21,11,,2.0,12/22/2010,"What a difference a couple of days makes since Marisa bragged about the service and we were disappointed with ours.  We have not gotten consistently good service here in a couple of years.  We were seated by the kitchen and watched all the wait staff except our waiter hustle in and out of the kitchen.  He strolled.  The kitchen floor was also very dirty.  On top of that, we didn't see a single busboy and tables sat there with all the dirty dishes etc. the whole time.  They weren't any busier than normal.  It all screams poor management.  We won't go back any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-watauga?start=40
