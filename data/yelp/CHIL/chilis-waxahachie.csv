Javi A.,"Waxahachie, TX",0,2,3,5.0,11/29/2017,"This is a super rare location. If you have experienced other chilis in the area then you know that service is not typically strong. BUT THIS location is different. It was such a relief when we have had multiple visits with OUTSTANDING service. The location is clean, well organized and we were sat immediately. The same can not be said for other locations in the metroplex. It's very clear that the management on site has a great relationship with his employees with respect going both ways. If you are looking for how a chilis is supposed to be run, look no further than this location. If you were like me and had written chilis off forever, give this location a chance and let them refresh your view of chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie
Morgan B.,"Waxahachie, TX",13,77,28,3.0,8/17/2017,"Food is pretty good, but overpriced. I'd rather go somewhere local, but we had a gift card. Service is pretty good. Decor is pretty good. Overall, it's just pretty good at best. I would suggest going to any number of other places here in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie
Lauren H.,"Waxahachie, TX",17,4,,1.0,3/11/2017,"You know that every Saturday in Waxahachie is a freaking nightmare with a huge influx of people. For the life of me l, how the hell are you understaffed and the patio dining area is closed when it is ""a sit outside kinda day""?  Isn't the bar where you make most of your money or should make most of your money?? No wonder this Chili's has such crappy reviews. The manager is almost non-existent even if they are on property. Pathetic. Never again...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie
Sadaf D.,"Plano, TX",11,9,,1.0,4/10/2017,"We came here with very low expectations because, well, it's a Chili's and they're not known for the best food or service. Unfortunately for us, they blew our expectations out of the water with their horrendous excuse for food and the snail-paced service. After a 9 minute wait for a table (confirmed times with the texts sent via their ""Nowait"" app), we were seated only to wait another 11 minutes. Nobody came so I grabbed the hostess who was sweet and took our drink orders. Our water came and a few minutes later our server appeared with utensils and napkins. Because we had more than enough time to decide, we immediately placed our order and began to wait again. 34 minutes later we got our steak and potatoes... My fiancés ""medium well"" steak was GRAY and had some sort of foam on top that looked even worse when it mixed with the melted butter and my steak was still mooing and bleeding from atop and spilling off the sides onto the plate (their version of medium) We obviously asked to speak with the manager and he acted as if nothing was wrong until we listed the several reasons why what we were served isn't edible. The replacements were only marginally better so we stuck to eating our potatoes and vegetables because it was clear that all of their meat had been frozen way too long and had developed freezer burn. Both of our water cups stayed empty for the entirety of the meal, even after she saw our glasses were empty upon bringing the check (we had to hunt her down to request the check).  We thought Chili's would be a safe choice because it's a chain but that clearly isn't the case. We couldn't get out of there quick enough. Lesson learned!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie
Jeannie W.,"Waxahachie, TX",29,24,3,2.0,12/31/2016,"My pics say it all.The service was terribly slow. If the waiter had checked back with us after he brought our food, be could have done something to fix the terrible food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie
Krystale T.,"Waxahachie, TX",27,4,1,1.0,8/7/2016,First let me start with the fact that I never post negative reviews! But I've never had a hostess so rude that it made me want to leave before I even got seated! I understand it's busy at lunch time on a Sunday but to seat several people ahead of a party of 5 just because there were 2-3 people in their party is ridiculous! When we approached her to let her know a booth would work for us (2 adults 3 kids) she got an attitude walked us to a booth way in the back by the to go order area and walked off! About an hour from the time we checked in we were sitting there with all of our drinks empty because we hadn't seen our server since she brought us our drinks and she finally shows up and with an attitude like we were a hassle for her to deal with refilled our drinks and then soon after we got our food! My kids ordered cheeseburgers and neither one had cheese on their burgers  all in all it wasn't a very good experience and we won't be returning unless they make some serious changes!!  P.s right before we left the same hostess seated another group and was very pleasant and nice to them which was very upsetting to see that she treated others nicer than she treated our family!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie
Marissa S.,"McKinney, TX",0,2,,1.0,3/10/2017,"If I could could give zero stars, I would.  Never again! Terrible service. Hot beer. Barely warm queso, cold burgers and fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie
Deb D.,"Wylie, TX",0,52,2,1.0,5/31/2016,"As a general rule I ignore kiosk ordering, as I feel it devalues our workforce and could cost jobs; however this time the kiosk has much more personality than the waitress. If I needed anything I had to order it through the kiosk, as she was visiting with friends at the nearby tables. Do these young people, who count on tips,  not realize that we old people are the ones with the disposable income to tip well? Duh? I'm not on Twitter, but if I were I would say #donotignoreoldpeopleoryoucannotpaytherent. Lmao",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie
Trinity C.,"Denton, TX",106,25,13,3.0,10/3/2016,"I used to come here on a regular basis but over time bar service has dwindled, under staffed and bartenders are waitressing and bartending taking good service from not only the bar but the surrounding tables as well, it should not take 30 min for them to take my order. Staff are amazing and are doing the best they can, management needs to schedule better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie
Kasmisha S.,"Waxahachie, TX",12,156,108,1.0,9/24/2015,"if i could give 0 stars i would.. this is the absolute worst chilis ive ever been to!! to go orders are never right, always leave things out, extremely terrible customer service!! go next door to olive garden instead!! disgusted!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie
Jonathan D.,"Waxahachie, TX",76,8,4,1.0,10/16/2016,"Went on a Saturday night around 7:30.  First time visiting.  Us and our 21 month old son.  Host sat us and then left us standing there without a high chair.  I had to go back to find him and he said he forgot.  We ordered guacamole and chips.  The smallest helping of guac I've ever had at a Chili's. It was maybe two small spoonfuls.  It took our food an hour to come out and when it did, it was wrong.  My wife asked to hold tomatoes and onions on her pasta, yet there they were.  My crispers had barely any sauce.  Our son's food didn't even come out.  The server said they forgot to make it...The worst Chili's I've ever been to.  Shame because this is our town.  The server was really nice and apologetic.  He didn't charge our drinks and gave us the coupon back we had for a free kids meal.  But I'd have to be crazy to go back during that time.  It wasn't a great experience.  They were clearly very short staffed and a lot of mistakes were made.  I hope they improve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie
Michael M.,"Fredericksburg, VA",18,7,2,1.0,2/8/2016,"Too slow, not busy either. Food is ok but they just don't care . I guess that what u get with all kids working.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie
David C.,"Portland, OR",140,28,8,2.0,6/24/2015,"If you are ordering to-go, make sure you schedule plenty of time in your schedule, because you most likely will be waiting there at least 20 minutes. When we put in our order they told us it would take 20 minutes, so we gave them an extra ten minutes; we waited 30 minutes and drove to Chili's to pick our order up. There were at least three orders in front of me, and no one had their food yet. Once we got our, it was a total prep time of almost an hour. The carry-out area in the back was very dirty, and slimy. The kitchen seemed like it was in chaos and we just felt like we were in everybody's way waiting in the tiny to-go corner. The food was what was expected when you go to Chili's - average American food, similar to what you'd find at an Applebee's. However, the horrendous carry-out service was one of the worse I've experienced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie
Amber K.,"Hendersonville, TN",327,3,,1.0,10/8/2016,"If I could have given 0 stars I would have.   Terrible service, dirty tables everywhere, food takes forever.   As our server was taking drinks to another table I kindly let him know we needed to place a Togo order when he had a moment, to which he responded under his breath ""I'm obviously busy"".  REALLY?!!! I get your management doesn't know how to schedule properly, but learn some respect!   We will never be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie
Brad D.,"Waxahachie, TX",58,47,2,1.0,6/13/2015,"By far one of the worst Chilis locations I have ever been to. Walked in and was met by the rudest hostess, we asked for a booth and were told none were available. As I looked around, all I saw were booths and she just said ""well I'll have to get a waitress to agree to take that table"" WTF? Just about everything we tried to order we were told they were out of and the waitress was even worse. Food was terrible, beer was flat and I can honestly say I'll never return. Whoever runs this place needs to seriously get this place together, judging by the other reviews here, I'm not the only one with this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie
James W.,"Midlothian, TX",0,4,,1.0,10/29/2016,I eat at chilis once a week at least. But last night 10-27-2016 at chilis in waxahachie the host was so rude to us. We went in around 9pm. He told us the wait was 15-20 min. We asked to sit on patio which was completely empty. He said they had a big group and we'd have to wait.  So we left. We we walked by patio the group was like 8 people and there was 6 empty tables. I went back in and asked again and he said that all we can put out there.  I asked why and agin he said big group. He argued with me and there was plenty of empty tables around. We was parked in front row facing patio. We sat in car as he liked to see if we was gone. Then he seated 2 tables out on patio of other teenagers that came in after us that he knew. This is why you should not have young tanagers representing your business at the front door. I've been to this chilis a thousand times and always been treated well. This guy had know clue about customer service and acted like he hated being there and we bothered him. Smh. Very sad. This location has slowly gotten worse and worse.  Maybe it's poor management. Not sure.  So me and all of my group will now be going to another restaurant in waxahachie now.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie
pamela p.,"Waxahachie, TX",0,4,,4.0,4/6/2015,The salmon here is awesome! The drinks are pretty good too. We seem to always get quick service and yummy food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie
P E.,"Waxahachie, TX",0,18,,1.0,6/29/2014,"What a dump.  It used to be good but I haven't been here in a while. The food served was pathetic. I ordered the fajitas loaded up with beef ,chicken and shrimp.  I was the poorest quality I have ever seen at a chain restaurant.  I know it's a chain brand and not going to be the finest food ever , but this was worse than fast food,  and I don't do that. Seriously I would have expected more from Taco Bell.  So the kitchen set the bar low , and the service at the bar was just below par. They need a total makeover here. If things are this bad you just have to start over. This is the worst Chili's I have been to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie
Wesley W.,"Ennis, TX",77,1,,1.0,9/2/2014,"Danielle Barrientez is the worst bartender and worst hostess there is. I came in and ordered a beer. I used my debit card but it didn't have money on it. I was on my phone moving the money over. While this was going on she is telling other customers "" he is going to rip me off"". The other customers and Danielle were threating my family. I finally paid with my debit card and walked out. I will never go there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie
Asher M.,"Midlothian, TX",68,2,,1.0,10/18/2013,"Incredibly slow service and and lackluster,  out of the box food ruined the experience for me.  I ordered the fajita trio,  which is among the more expensive items,  and received it as though it had been thrown out of a Walmart freeze-lock bag and onto a reheater.   Beyond that,  the manager was rude and short throughout the night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie
Brooke N.,"Norman, OK",9,1,,2.0,11/12/2014,"We sat for almost 5 minutes before we were approached, then when we got our queso AFTER our BURNED chips and salsa BC he was ""waiting"" on it, it was cold and runny. Next, when my margarita came out it was straight line juice and tequila with no mix in it at all. When my boyfriend took it back to the bar and brought it back it still wasn't right. We've never had these issues at the one in Ennis. So word to the wise.... Drive the extra 15 minutes where they have always seemed to get it right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie?start=20
Danielle D.,"Waxahachie, TX",0,22,1,4.0,1/4/2016,Their new lunch specials are a great deal! Our server was nice and quick at getting us what we needed.

Christine W.,"Austin, TX",83,294,280,3.0,9/15/2013,"We ate here on a crazy busy Sunday. Obviously short staffed with dirty dishes sitting around. Once the staff decided to clear the tables they pushed the food residue to the floor. They also allow smoking in the restaurant. That's just gross! Another peeve of mine... The community doesn't believe in removing their hats at the table either based on the number of baseball and cowboy hats perched on peoples heads.  The new manager and Lindsey, our waitress, were the only people moving with purpose in the front of the house. The food came out quickly and hot once our order was placed. The restaurant is in a nice location just off the highway. We would give it another chance on a different day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie?start=20
Gregory F.,"Midlothian, TX",3,4,1,5.0,4/3/2013,"My wife and I just had dinner at this location. We were served by the most amazing server, Amanda. She was very kind and attentive. If you go, ask for her table as she won't let you down. My wife had the soup and salad combo which is always a pretty safe order. Although the potato soup is incredible! I ordered something new on their menu, the 9 inch taco pizza. It was very good and surprised me a bit because it actually tasted like a taco. I have had several taco pizza's  in my day and this keeps up with the Casey's taco pizza up north.  Overall, great dinner and must for couples who don't want to cook and instead want to be served good food and decent drinks at a decent price. Total meal $32.15 Tipped $17.85 (Amanda was worth every penny) Total $50",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie?start=20
Allen A.,"Austin, TX",0,7,4,5.0,10/11/2015,"I ordered a to-go dinner and whilst awaiting my food, I had four different waitors/waitresses ask to make sure I have been helped. They were welcoming, caring, and respectful. I'll come back very soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie?start=20
Marye A.,"Lancaster, TX",105,49,32,2.0,7/24/2014,Food is good .. Service is awesome but the smoke from the bar is disgusting ... If they'd lose the smokers I'd give it a solid 4 stars.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie?start=20
Monica E.,"Midlothian, TX",40,7,4,1.0,7/7/2015,"If I could give it 0 I would. Party of 2 on a weekend. Restaurant wasn't busy~~no wait. Our table was dirty and we were sat by the To Go section. Waiter was okay...mostly talked to other staff about being ""tired"". Did not like that staff was hanging around to go section. No one seemed to be working. Husband and I ordered $20 meal. App: chips & salsa. Salsa was fresh. Entree 1: 6 oz sirloin, mashed skillet potatoes, broccoli. entree 2: chicken fajita with fixings. Sirloin was raw and had to send back. Second one was over Cooked and didn't send back. Beef looked unappetizing. My meal came without my potatoes since ""they weren't ready"" ??? Broccoli was mushy and so overcooked with no seasoning. Fajitas seemed like old chicken with mostly grilled onions and peppers. This meal should include rice and beans (it's an extra .99 charge). Had to ask for another salt shaker since the one on our table was so dirty and so old it had rust on top. So disgusting!!!! Chills food quality has decreased and is unappealing ""food"" .. Nothing special. Manager needs to clean up this location! Do not know how chills is still in business with this POOR food quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie?start=20
Kelly G.,"Plano, TX",1,15,1,1.0,9/5/2013,"Whaaaat! 5 stars?!?! I don't get it. This place is gross. What restaurant still allows their customers to smoke INSIDE?

Stacy M.,"Grand Prairie, TX",48,63,60,4.0,8/15/2011,"I worked at a Chili's once and I swore to myself I would never go back, even to eat! But I caved and I got hooked on Southwestern Eggrolls and Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers again. It's as yummy as any regular Chili's but I favor this particular restaurant because it's close to where I live, despite that they still allow smoking and they have smoking and non-smoking sections. Aside from that the service here is good and I recommend asking for Caleb. He's super funny and he's a wonderful server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waxahachie?start=20
