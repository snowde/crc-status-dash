Rashad S.,"Rochester, NY",369,1,1,5.0,12/8/2017,"One of the best experiences I've ever had. Went with my best friend and we both were pleased with the new Chili's of the town. Service was TOP notch and food was PERFECT! And for desert, Salted Caramel Molten cake. Our waiter was Brian and he was a really cool guy who made sure our experience was nothing less than CHILI PEPER HOT! LOL.  When you go, sit at the bar for the best seats in the house!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster-5
Michael W.,"Rochester, NY",147,117,1,1.0,1/11/2018,"This review concerns the take out service in this restaurant.    Eating in at this restaurant is a delightful experience that I would highly recommend. The take out service here is far below the standards of what I would expect. I have tried to use the take out service here twice and it has been unacceptable on both occasions.  The first time I came here I ordered menu items that they gladly accepted over the phone.  When I showed up,l I was informed that what some of what I had ordered was no longer on the menu.   This company needs to conform their to go orders so that it does not confuse the customers or the employees.  I refer to that as ""good common sense"".    My second experience was a huge disappointment to me and my family.  I called on the phone to order spinach queso, guacamole, and some egg rolls.   I am only ordering to go because I have hungry people at home that want to eat and I am in a hurry.  When I get to the store not one person knows anything about my to go order.   Now I verified the phone number for the store when I arrived and I know I called the right place.   So off I went because I had some place I needed to be and no one got anything from Chili's.   I give this store the lowest possible rating of one star and will not order anything to go from this place again.  I do not recommend that you use their to go service and I am actually upset enough to a point that I don't know if I will ever return at all.   Not only am I upset but so are the hungry people in my home.  It is such a shame to open a new business like this in my neighborhood and to see this place fail.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster-5
Marilynne L.,"Rochester, NY",154,67,81,2.0,11/20/2017,"Opening glitch?  I don't think so.  I specified no peppers because I'm allergic to them. My dinner came with .....peppers.   Ok.  Goofs happen.  When our server offered to have another made, sans peppers, sounded good. Time passed.  And passed . Companions finished eating. Wait staff did not offer to check on progress .of my dinner.  After 28 minutes, I found a manager and asked where my dinner could be.  By then it was so late we wanted to get going and I asked for it in a carry out box. The box contained  a smaller version of my original meal , but someone had removed the peppers.   What remained was a dried out, burned mess.  Much of the original meal was missing or maybe just burned beyond recognition. My  dinner  had  originally been served on a metal plate which continued to cook the contents. There were broken crisp burned pieces of something unrecognizable by sight and taste. I pointed out to our server  the bill showed we were charged twice for this meal.  She said she had to enter a second  order to get the new corrected meal and promptly removed the second charge.    Someone in the kitchen made the decision not to promptly replace the meal as promised.  They decided to pick through the original meal and re-serve it. It took nearly a half to pick  the chopped peppers out of the original meal,  resulting in an unacceptable wait and inedible food.  The place looks great.  Noise level is very high. Second visit same exact experience.  One of us gets their  meal.  Other sits and waits then has to go ask where the meal is.    If this happened on two separate visits,  I'm not going again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster-5
Marie E.,"Ocoee, FL",62,150,136,5.0,10/21/2017,"This location is new.  That being said the food, drinks,waitstaff were all a 10.  If there were kinks to workout they did it or were handled early because today I could not find anything anyone would or could complain about.  I am visiting here but would strongly recommend you local folk stop in and enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster-5
Jen K.,"Rochester, NY",38,21,28,4.0,12/1/2017,"Location is small so you'll probably wait at busy times,  but they send you a text when your table is ready.  We waited at the bar,  and they have 2 for 1 margaritas all the time! Food was good,  service was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster-5
Brian B.,"Webster, NY",59,53,6,5.0,10/12/2017,"My wife and I went here tonight for a early dinner. Wow, talk about the royal treatment. Door's were opened for us, the hostess was all smiles and very friendly. It has been years since either one of us has been in a Chili's, but I always loved their food. 2 manager's were walking the floor making sure everyone was being taken care of. Our waitress Aurora was just the best. She was very friendly, attentive, on point with everything from napkins, refills on drinks, asking if there is anything we need, and how is our food. She was great. Many other waitresses visited with us asking about our thoughts about the guacamole and how does it compare to other places. If it was our first time here, how is our food! We got the dinner for 2 for $22.00 and oh my gosh, the amount of food, and the quality of flavor...Just Excellent! I know it is only the beginning of the first week of their opening, but I do truly hope everything from how we were greeted, and the friendliness and attentiveness is something your location holds value too and continues for a long time to come...Thank you all so much!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster-5
Angilee T.,"Rochester, NY",0,57,7,5.0,10/14/2017,"First let me say, I hope this Chili's stays consistent. We like Chili's but the ones around here just suck. This one was great, and our waitress Aurora was excellent. It was busy and she was still on top of everything. Food was good and portions were good ad well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster-5
