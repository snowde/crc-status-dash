Lauren L.,"Houston, TX",31,152,78,3.0,8/19/2017,3 stars because the food was served hot and was flavorful but we were seated in a location which was close to bar and the cigarette smoke was awful even though there are glass divider along the booth almost a full wall.  So we asked to move and no hesitation we were.  I think it should this place needs to become no smoking or remodel and separate the dinning & bar area better.  It's chili's nothing fancy but it's tasty and saved me from a long evening in the kitchen since I had not prep my meal the night before.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster
BigFishLittleFish F.,"Dallas, TX",0,60,13,2.0,12/16/2017,"We were in town to visit family and considering Chili's is on a 'new and improved' campaign, we wanted to give it a try. I think the new menu is on track but sadly, the experience we had at this location cancelled out all the good things you are trying to accomplish. I have to give kudos to our server and partner/server and I wish I had their names. They did a nice job! However, we had issues with the temperature of the restaurant and on 4 occasions, had to leave our group to speak to someone about the freezing subzero temps. Think there were clues when the other diners were wearing winter coats while eating? Think there were clues when you had 3 other parties seated and left or asked to be moved? Where was the manager?? Seriously, where was the manager? We may give another location a try but my guess, not one person in that entire dining room will return to this location. Very sad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster
Whitney V.,"Pearland, TX",38,160,277,4.0,8/17/2017,"Chili's has upped their game in the past few years, offering lighter options and new recipes. We once avoided it after stomach aches and a lackluster menu, but we visit it at least monthly now for fresher options. Service at this one is also good, with the restaurant looking cleaner when we visit early on weekday evenings. The food is flavorful, but not quite as good as other Chili's we've visited. For example, the pesto mayo is more mayo and less seasoning than other spots, but those are minor details. They are always accommodating with our requests to remove or substitute for food restrictions as well. The biggest two drawbacks for us are atmosphere. The music is always so loud. Sometimes it's difficult to carry a conversation at the table. Their bar is also open with half bars. When I came in around 4:30 for a to-go order, I was immediately hit with the smell of cigarettes. Turns out one smoker had the entire restaurant smelling of smoke so badly I had to wait in the back to try to avoid it because the bar opens to the front. In today's world, not a classy move. If there were 3 1/2 stars, it'd be more appropriate, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and go with 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster
Rick Y.,"Webster, TX",14,54,202,4.0,5/14/2017,"I stopped by Chili's in Webster, Tx to get an early dinner with my girlfriend.  We both ordered the chicken crispers because we are just big fans of it.  I ordered the roasted corn version while my girlfriend ordered the standard corn on the cob. So as usuall, the chicken crispers were good but did seem a little more fried than other times.  Still good tasting and yes I ate all my plate haha.  The roasted corn was really really good. The closet thing I could compare it too is a Mexican version of an elote.  The mayo/butter and the seasoning was great and was in every bite.  We did order the Texas French fries (cheeze, jalapenos, and bacon).  They were tasty and came in a cool cast iron skillet.  I would of ordered another appetizer but it was not my decision that day I guess :) Either way, service was good and I will be going back some time in the short future.

Eric J.,"Pearland, TX",90,10,12,5.0,8/30/2016,"First of all let me say that as an ex Fridays bartender I am always ready to be judgemental of Chili's, but there was NOTHING I could judge the Chili's in Clear Lake about. The night started normal, just a couple of sexy individuals hankering for a drink and a place to feed at.    We walked in and Adam, the lead bartender and master of the mix, quickly whipped us up some Presidente Margaritas and threw down some White Spinache Queso dip before us Our minds were on the verge of being blown.  He then tipped us a wink and...KABOOM! We had to surrender to this man's charm and drink expertise or suffer a pleasant fate of alcoholic anonymity.  While we gave in and enjoyed the gifts this beautiful man bestowed upon us, the manager Shannon approached us. We noticed her official lanyard and demeanor and it caused a ""holy smokes!"" moment. Who did we piss off? But she quickly smiled and introduced herself and the love of my life and I found ourselves lost in her conversation. Needless to say, she was an absolute angel. We laughed, we talked, we bonded. Between Adam and Shannon, we truly felt like home with a beautiful family. Chili's in Clear Lake will forever be our favorite place to enjoy our date nights!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster

Waitress disappeared for 10-15 minutes, long enough for my husband to comment on it. We decided to just let it go because she did come back and delivered prompt service. Unfortunately, my margarita ***may*** have had a single splash of tequila in it. Not stoked, but alright.  Our order was incorrect so they ended up having to reorder the correct menu items and when the food actually came it was SWIMMING in grease.  I understand to expect a certain level of grease when ordering a hamburger, but the lettuce was DRIPPING, y'all. The top bun wouldn't even stay on it was sliding all over the place. Flavorless beef to boot.  What gives, Chili's?

Lori L.,"Austin, TX",0,25,5,1.0,8/7/2016,"Filthy! I will never eat at this Chili's again. And from the time we walked in, I knew we should have just walked right back out. Wish we had. Floors filthy. Table when we sat down was sticky and had hair on it. Waiter was never to be found. Food was typical Chili's, at least they are consistent there but definitely nothing like WOW, that was good. Just very basic, nothing special at all.  The expeditor that brought our food was the only highlight. Courteous, excited to be there and wanted to make sure we were happy and had everything we needed, and with personality. Put THAT guy on the floor! Or in management.  Ate there last night, Saturday around 9-930. Today, the friend I ate with is sick from the food and can't leave the house.  I'm not surprised at all.

We had to flag down a different waiter in order to get a refill on our drinks after waiting 5 minutes with them empty. Appetizer was good. When the food finally came, you could tell it was sitting under a lamp or something for a while. Fries were cold, and the burger, which had been cut in half, was also cold. In the mid portion where it had been cut, there was spinach or something on both halves. I'm assuming leftover from whatever that knife had cut previously. Can you say cross contamination?!

Danna G.,"Houston, TX",489,153,194,2.0,4/7/2014,"Late night eats & drinks. We arrived here at around 10:45 pm and the place closes at midnight. Hostess was not available to seat any guest. So my husband and I seated ourselves as well as the other couple that walked in at the same time as we did.  I guess with it being ""so close"" to closing the staff had mentally shut down already.  We were eventually approached by a very nice waiter that took our drink order and offered a free appetizer because of the inconvenience. Chips & Salsa...salsa was refrigerator cold and chips were stale. At least that was free. I'm just not a big fan of Chili's; it's a cheap mediocre place to feed the family and not go broke.   I ordered the grilled chicken club burger and it was pretty good; the chickent was juicy and the food was hot. My husband ordered the fajita trio (looks like they changed the shrimp to the smaller ones but kept the price the same). They cheated me on the fries. Seems as if they gave me the last bits that were in the bag which were a few little hard pieces. The staff that did decide to come out of the kitchen was fairly nice. It had been at least a year since I had been to Chili's and it will prob be at least two before I go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster

Once we went in, it was easy to see why. The place was filthy as if a parade had rolled through the joint and left a disaster for the street crews to deal with. The food here wasn't any better than it is in any other Chili's, equally as bland and tasteless. We quickly nibbled at our meal and bailed. The only saving grace was our hard working waiter who looked after us, and boom, was off to see other patrons in an equally fast and efficient manner!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster

HOWEVER....why in the HELL do they allow smoking?  That spoils the whole experience when you are greeted with second hand smoke when you enter or leave.  I was going to give the place a rating of four, but the smell of smoke is disgusting!  However, I didn't smell it where we were eating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster

Kimberly L.,"Webster, TX",318,475,758,3.0,5/11/2012,"So it seems like Chili's has become my go-to place recently. I'm not real sure if that's a reflection on me or them, but who am I to complain about decent priced food that tastes great? Less filling calorie wise? Not so much. But that's to be expected. I believe they do have some ""lighter"" menu items but truthfully I didn't even care that night....lol  The one and only reason this place gets 3 stars and not 4 or even 5 is that smoking is allowed at the bar. I am not a smoker, and I can't stand to smell smoke while I am eating. That's just a personal preference and one that weighs heavily for me when I write a review. The other night I wanted a burger and a beer, and not necessarily in that order, after a really long, trying day at work. Hubby suggested Chili's and it sounded like a good plan. I knew they had the 2 for $20 deal which included an appetizer and two entrees and one of the entrees included was a burger so it definitely fit the bill. I was hoping for some happy hour specials, and they did have those but they were only good at the bar, which was a little irritating but not enough to either make me leave or deal with secondhand smoke. The host did try to set us near the bar, but when we found out about the smoking, he moved us back to a corner which was behind the wall with no eye rolling or snide comments, so that was a nice surprise, as other hosts/hostesses at different places have been less accommodating when we ask to move. The server was attentive and prompt and when I ordered my beer, asked if I wanted a water while I was waiting, which I thought was nice. We ordered the Texas Cheese Fries and two bacon cheeseburgers from the 2 for $20 menu and man that was some good food! Either that or I was just eating and drinking my stress away......either way I was happy! The burger was huge! And you get a s*** ton of fries too.... seriously if we had three people there we could have all eaten for the $20! I mean, I ate all my burger and some of my fries, plus my half of the appetizer and I was so super stuffed! Actually over stuffed and feeling kinda yucky later but man it was worth it! Our server was Brook, and he was great! Very attentive and funny, yet not hovering or overbearing. He tried to talk us into dessert but we were so flipping full there was no way. He invited us to ask for him when we go back and I thought that was a nice touch, and we probably will. Our total bill was $28 and some change for the 2 burgers, the appetizer and 2 beers....that's a great deal and with the great service and yummy food, I will most definitely be back! Just not to sit at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster?start=20

No host or hostess to be found on a Thursday night so we just sat ourselves in the bar. As we were waiting to be greeted three more families came in waiting to be seated as well. It got pretty crowded near the door.  Bartender was friendly and as efficient as he could be given he was waiter for the lounge, bartender, AND to go. Somebody else was hanging out behind the bar on a headpiece but they didn't seem to be very helpful.  The food was alright, but nachos weren't what I expected. As good as it can get for a chain. They had pretty good drink specials going on in the bar but stay away from anything cheesy.

We walked into the restaurant about 59% tables were filled and a handful of people at the bar and not ONE EMPLOYEE TO BE FOUND. We stood in the entrance way for 5 minutes ( I looked at my phone). After seeing one employee bring food to a table in a heavily seated are we made our way over to the section, found any empty table and seated ourselves. The man finally came to our table several minutes after we sat down. We explained to him that no one was to be found and that we sat ourselves. Without even hesitating or apologizing he asks ""what do you want yo drink ma'am?"" in somewhat of an attitude. Our food was mediocre nothing really good, huge servings of decent quality food. The rest of the evening we barely saw him, had to ask for water and silverware. I do not expect a lot from Chili's but I do expect basic customer service.

My bf gets the burger, pretty hard to screw up a burger, every now and then the bacon gets burned but it's still a good burger.  This last time we went, it was extremely busy. It was strange because our server told us he might be the server or someone else, just seemed real chaotic all around. Meh...whatever, he took the order, life is great, then we realize 30 min later, where is our appetizer. Immediately our entree appears but no appetizer :( We tell our server and he apologizes and asked if we would still like the appetizer and that he would take it off the bill, we declined because we were already eating the main meal. No big fuss, we were a little ticked but they did warn us about the backup in the kitchen. No less than 1 minute later the manager, Jeff, came out with our appetizer, apologized and said there were no excuses, and if we saved our appetites the desert would be on him too. He was very professional and sincere with his apology and about the mishap...and to be honest, it really made us feel better to be acknowledged in a such a way.  So yea, is the entire menu a smorgasbord of awesomeness...no, of course not, it's Chili's. Are there good things to satisfy you, hell yea there is, especially if you like greasy.

Other than that, you can expect crappy service. At first I thought it was training issues which is why we had a string of poor service experiences but we kept giving them the benefit of a doubt.

How you gonna call that guiltless..my ass! That is like 3/4 of my recommended daily caloric intake.   OK on to this chili's..This location is not the best.

Before we ordered, A damn flying cockroach flew across the room and onto our table..So of course we did the girl thing and shrieked, the people across from us saw it too. Well the manager came over and gave us free food and our neighbor free food, told us to order whatever we wanted.   So we just ordered one of like everything-even chocolate malts to go. Now that i think about it, we shouldn't have even taken the severance -that shit is just nasty. we should have left right then and there! I hate to call a place out like that and i know there are bugs in Texas and all but a flying cockroach coming at you like 30 mph before you even order..Are you for real!?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster?start=40
Michael C.,"Houston, TX",0,8,1,1.0,7/23/2013,"This location has disappointed me more than once I will not be going back this time. Saturday night around 8 the place was deserted that should have been a clue. The floors were filthy walking to our table, the table next to ours was trashed,food all over the floor. Service was as bad as the place looked. The food was ok no problem there. We had to ask for silverware after the food was brought to the table,though. Took forever to get our check and the trashed table was not cleared throughout our meal despite there being hardly any customers. I felt like I needed a shower after I left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster?start=40
Lauren A.,"Heber Springs, AR",106,192,57,1.0,11/20/2009,"How is it that Chili's chili isn't good? Isn't that what they are famous for?!  My family decided ""let's eat at Chili's"" one evening and I'm not a huge fan of the place but I went along willingly enough. Signs for Chili's Terlingua Chili were hung all over the place so I decided to try to famous dish that the place was named for.  I was not impressed with Chili's Terlingua Chili. First of all, there is WAY too much chili powder in that dish. WAY TOO MUCH. Second, they don't serve onions with it, just cheese and sour cream and crackers of course. The cheese I can get on board with, but sour cream just seems odd and foreign to me so I opted for no sour cream on my bowl.  Also, a bowl is way too much chili for anyone to eat unless their stomach is made of iron. A cup, maybe... but as rich as the stuff is, I'd think maybe even a cup would be difficult to finish. The crackers are essential to eating this chili. Without them, I see no way to eat it. A spoon? Nay. It's too rich to shove spoonfuls into your mouth without something to dull it down a notch or two.  I could see maybe ordering some fries and then dumping the chili on them, but then you still face the iron stomach issue. It's just way too rich to be eaten by man.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster?start=40
Karen R.,"Bacliff, TX",0,5,,3.0,8/31/2014,"Food was decent. And the food comes out in a good timing. Our waitress tonight gave somewhat good service.  When we ordered our appetizer  she didn't bother to ask us if we were ready to order our entree and walked off before we could tell her we were ready to order, so we had to wait  an extra 10 mins until we could actually order.  She tried to give my bf a refill on iced tea and forgot to bring back our drink.  Not to mention it took a long time to get our check.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster?start=40
Paul G.,"Pearland, TX",1,22,4,2.0,8/31/2014,"Like all Chili's Restaurants, the food quality is practically the same.  The differences in the restaurants are the service and overall experience.  This particular Chili's not one of my favorites.  This restaurant allows smoking - so no matter what, the entire restaurant smells like cigarettes.  If you come in for lunch, the place smells like bleach.  I assume they are trying to dilute the cigarette smell.   The best way to get rid of it is not to allow smoking.  I will only do Take Out from this Chili's, I will never dine in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster?start=40
Patricia M.,"Houston, TX",2,9,3,5.0,1/6/2012,"Wow, what is up with all the bad reviews??? This place is so awesome.  I mean, come on...where else can you sit at the bar area, eat a decent meal, watch the game, drink your beer, and smoke?  Not very many places left in this area where you can do that unless you go to a crowded little bar.  But to do that in a restaurant....now that is KING!!  Love their food and service.  Our server always happens to be Ryan and he rocks.  He keeps our Presidente Margaritas (no salt) coming and always refills our chips when we run low.  To us, he makes this place what it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster?start=40
Alexis B.,"Cypress, TX",161,11,2,1.0,1/31/2012,"This was the worst Chili's I have ever eaten at.  The service was horrible, the staff was rude and forgetful. They forgot to ring in my child's meal, so I have a starving toddler.  They brought out my salad and it was soggy like it had been sitting in the back window, my friends burger was cold.  With a kids meal you can choose milk, juice or soda - I requested apple juice. They do not carry apple juice because that is not stocked in their bar - umm are you kidding me.  My options were pineapple juice, cranberry juice and they ""might"" have orange juice.  My child drinks none of those and I have a sippy with milk in it already.  There was no option to not have a drink so I can pay $5 for food that didn't get rung in and a drink he doesn't need.  When I spoke to the manager she was apathetic at best.  I was so unimpressed!  I will not eat at this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster?start=40
Marisa F.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",335,245,212,1.0,12/1/2008,"I wouldn't suggest vacating this Chili's.  I should have gone to Mc Donald's had I known the food would be so bad.  I ordered the fajita chicken salad and chips and salsa.  The fajita chicken appeared to be the prepackaged style chicken that gave the appearance that it was grilled.  The salad was old, saggy and limp, there were about 5 black beans and 5 corn pieces, I sent the salad back and ordered the broccoli cheese soup only to be more disappointed.  It looked like melted cheese and tasted like relish instead of broccoli.  I couldn't take a second bite of either the salad or the soup.  Needless to say the fries were terrible too, I stole some from my date's plate.  I would stick to what Chili's is good at, their fried boneless buffalo wings.  Although, my date did say that his ribeye was good, he prefers to go to Chili's because their ribeye is cheaper then Outback.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-webster?start=40
