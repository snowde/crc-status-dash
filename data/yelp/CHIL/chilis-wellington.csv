Mindy G.,"Vero Beach, FL",0,2,,5.0,12/5/2017,We love Chili's ! We often go because of its good food and cleanliness. The chips and salsa are our favorite and we love to have the 2 for 1 margaritas!  I had the buffalo chicken salad and it was so good and fresh! My husband had the margarita chicken and loved it!  The manager cane by to ask us how everything was. We told him the service was very good . We will be back for sure !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington
Jessica P.,"West Palm Beach, FL",1,22,65,2.0,1/11/2018,Wanted to grab a quick bite and use a coupon for a free guacamole appetizer. Once we got there the host quoted us 25 minutes so we decided to wait. They use your phone number to text you when your table is ready. We waited close to an hour before being seated. Once I received a text that our table was ready and went to the hostess. There I was asked for my name and waited again to be taken to our table. Two other parties that came after us were seated and then I was asked again for my name and were seated. It was annoying and very unorganized especially since the parties that came after us were larger/ or equal size to be seated before us. Service was ok since it was a busier time. Food was alright but that's what you get for Chili's. It's nice to be able to pay at the table kiosk with a card so you don't have to wait for the waiter. Not my ideal restaurant but it would do at a less busier time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington
Michael L.,"West Palm Beach, FL",33,6,1,1.0,10/16/2017,My family and I go to Chili's once every few months. We went there for dinner tonight to celebrate my daughters birthday. Absolutely the WORST service I have ever experienced. The food took so long to get and was cold by the time we ate.  I had to bus my own table to make room for desserts. I don't think I'll be going back to chili's any time soon. Horrible!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington
Jaclyn V.,"Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, CA",0,9,1,1.0,12/15/2017,I wish that I could give this place a zero rating. The absolute worst restaurant service I have ever had. It only took 5 minutes to sit down and from there it went downhill. It took the server 15 minutes to greet the table and by the time we got our drinks it was 22 minutes from the time we sat down. I had to ask a host to get our server before she even came to the table. When she came to get out drink order we decided to order our food as well. It took another 30 minutes to get our food and when it came out my husbands food didn't come out. I found the manager and spoke to him and asked why it took so long to get drinks and food and he tried to tell me that it was only 30 minutes from time we sat to the time we got our food. He began to argue with me and I told him we would pay for our drinks and leave. When he came back with the drink receipt he wouldn't show me the ticket from when the server took our order to see that she did take longer than he had said. I felt so disrespected and he made me feel like I was lying and that he didn't believe me. So unprofessional!!! He argued back and forth and snatched the drink receipt from in front of me and said to just go and to not worry about the drinks! WILL NEVER RETURN!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington
Rabia J.,"Boynton Beach, FL",2698,672,2144,3.0,2/16/2016,"After a disastrous trip to Chili's at the Ft. Lauderdale airport, this Chili's did the trick to make us happy diners.  We went to eat the molten chocolate cake, I haven't had this dessert in over 3 years and it was delectable in many ways.  It was warm and moist with a volcanic chocolate covered dome with vanilla ice cream.   This Chili's location is nice, it was my first time here but overall the company seems like they have improved their seating with colorful arrays of colors on the wall, contemporary style lighting and ziosk.  Ziosk are computer tablets where you can order desserts/refill of drinks, pay for your check without having to wait etc.  I like their strategies as a company to move forward with technology and stay relevant.   The restaurant itself was not that busy at 6 pm but the floors were messy and slippery.  We sat on one of the bar tables, our server was attentive and quick.  We ended up getting the 2 for $20 which has one appetizer to share and two entrees.  This deal has been going on for a few years now.  The cheesy jalapeño fries were a let down, the cheese was over cooked and it had dried out.  On to the entrees: Cajun shrimp pasta was good, the mango salsa and tilapia was decent but next time sauce on the side for that, it was a tad bit too sweet.   By the end of the meal we were stuffed, the portions are big for entrees.  However, we braved out and ate the molten chocolate cake, and were ready for nap time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington
Sam M.,"Boca Raton, FL",480,281,2420,4.0,2/17/2016,With our last trip to the Fort Lauderdale airport Chilis being a complete disaster we couldn't wait to get back to Chilis so we could set the record straight. This was my first visit to the Wellington mall location and it did not disappoint. From the outside it looks as if they have redone the place and the inside has also been refurbished.  The management has also kept up with the times and every table has a tablet from which you can order and pay for your meal. This is very convenient and using it for the first time I think more restaurants will catch up with this idea. Now the server is still a very integral part of the equation as they make sure your order is correct and bring it out immediately.  We ordered the Cajun shrimp pasta and the tilapia as part of the 2 for $20 dinner and later as dessert even though we were full ordered the molten chocolate cake which was super delicious and made my evening.  My recommendation: if you head towards Chilis and decide not to have their desserts you are missing out in a big way !!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington
Rita K.,"New York, NY",0,119,,4.0,3/31/2017,"We now know why the Chili pepper is relevant.   Their Mexican food menu items are terrific!   Fajitas and combo meals are plentiful and compete with any good Mexican restaurant.  The only negative is their ""green rice"" which is dry and not very tasty. Ask for an alternative  Glad this chain has revamped their menu!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington
Morgan D.,"Plant City, FL",10,22,8,2.0,3/22/2017,"I gave a two star review because the food was as decent as it can be for Chili's. I don't have very high expectations usually because I find their food to be overall flavorless and poor quality.  However, I agreed to go with a co-worker after work last night. My friend got there before I did and sat at the bar. Big mistake... When I showed up, the woman behind the bar, who obviously hated her life and her job, walked over and said something to the effect of, ""What do you want?"" I didn't know at that moment what my beverage was going to be. Instead of perhaps telling me some things on special, she walked away.  My friend had to lean over the bar to grab me a menu so I could browse the drinks. She finally came back and I gave my drink order. Now, I have been a bartender for over 12 years in corporate and unincorporated restaurants and there is one thing that I know to be true; Smiling gets you more tips and makes a guest want to return!  We didn't get one smile from this woman. Not. One.   Subsequently, I literally had to get the bartender's attention for every, single item we ordered or needed from our appetizer, to silverware, to a glass of water, and then the check. Mind you, she had one other couple at the bar the entire time and one man who was unfortunate enough to find himself in the same predicament we were in, sat down midway through our dinner. At one point, I heard him ask for some hot sauce and she shoved the pepper shaker at him!  I tipped her 20% because as a former restauranteur, I understand that every day is not a great day. Maybe she's losing her house or her kid isn't doing well in school and she was distracted from properly executing her job. Now looking back on it, I regret my 20% tip that went to someone that was absolutely miserable and hate the fact that we practically served ourselves.  Worst service without a smile.  PS- Chili's, you can save your generic ""We are sorry to hear that, please give us another try"" response. If a store manager can't take the time to personally respond to your guests' comments, then I can't take the time to try your awful restaurant again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington
Kristy S.,"Wellington, FL",41,1,,1.0,8/7/2017,Nobody here smiles! Bartender just seems pissed...atmoshphere horrible hopefully my food makes up for it. I've been in the biz for 21yrs if ure that unhappy find a different job.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington
Jason F.,"Wellington, FL",4,3,,1.0,7/29/2017,"Just got back from dinner, bottom line the food took an hour to come out of the kitchen and wasn't edible , ribs,steak chicken all gross.

Raj K.,"Lake Worth, FL",0,5,1,4.0,9/19/2017,"I love the food and the pricing. We usually pick up from this location.

Madison K.,"Boynton Beach, FL",0,3,,1.0,8/17/2017,"So I've been to this chilli's before but this time it took 25 minutes just to get a water on the table and 15 minutes for our server (chrisie) to notice we were sitting in her section, it was very slow so that didn't make much sense. She took app order and never came back to take  entree order, the apps came out and we had no plates, when asked for she had forgotten and by that time we were done with the apps.. then she finally came over to take the Order which took 45 minutes to come out... finally when coming to pay she gave us the check, and  it had multiple other tables orders on it. The  server kept telling us ""oh it's fixed now check again"" and still left multiple items from another table on the check.

Tiffany S.,"Boynton Beach, FL",86,122,438,3.0,2/24/2016,"Their Santa Fe salad was actually pretty good. The 2-4-1 drinks are weak; so I decided to go with wine.

Andrew S.,"Wellington, FL",3,14,109,5.0,2/23/2015,"As a weekly customer, I can say that this is a really solid Chili's. I would recommend their Ribs, Fajita's, and my personal favorite, the Buffalo & Ranch chicken sandwich. (Which I mentioned in my original review.) Service here is top notch. We've gotten great service from Joey, Jarrod, Alex, and Ana (who is usually working weekends). The management here does an excellent job running things as well. Recently, this restaurant completed a major renovation, and it now feels much more open. Even if you are not a fan of Chili's or chains in general, I highly recommend this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington
Carrie P.,"Wellington, FL",114,15,1,1.0,8/25/2016,"Took my daughter's to this location last night and was quite appalled at EVERYTHING from the time we walked in until we left (without finishing our dinner).  I would like to begin telling about my experience by stating that I have worked at Chili's in NC years ago so I know how things should be run from not only a customers P.O.V. but also a former employees P.O.V.  When we walked in their was no hostess at the front for at least 3 minutes and their were two other families standing with us. It wasn't busy inside so the hostess had no reason to NOT be standing at her hostess stand and greeting customers as they walked in. The manager finally walks over to seat us and when the server comes to the table he is looking everywhere OTHER THAN at us, the customers at his table. He took our drink and appetizer order. Someone else grabbed our appetizer and delivered it to us while our server grabbed our drinks. He took our order again while not ever looking at us and that was the last time we ever had him at our table. We needed refills before our meal came but couldn't find our waiter. The young lady that ran our food out to us got us refills on our drinks as she saw they were empty. My daughter needed salt for her dish and no salt would come out of the shaker. I looked at it for her and noticed that the lid of the salt shaker was caked over with, what I can only guess and hope was, dried black beans juice. Again, no server ever came to the table so I couldn't ask for another one.  We did not finish our individual meals and we sat and waited for someone to pay us some attention to get us some boxes. Again, no one ever came. I told my daughter's that were no longer going to wait on anyone so I paid on the tables kiosk and we left VERY unsatisfied.  The manager never even came by to check on any tables. The wait staff walked through the kitchen while singing rap songs to each other but once they came around the corner into the dining room they had the worst looks on their faces. They made it quite obvious that they didn't like their jobs and the manager made it quite obvious with how the store was being run that he either didn't care or was unable to get a hold on his staff. Someone needs to visit this store and get a handle on everything because that was an absolute mess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington
Jill C.,"Wellington, FL",44,67,,3.0,8/27/2016,"Hadn't been to Chili's in a very long time so we thought we would give it a try. First the good: Food was fine.  Not great.  Not bad.  Just fine.  I had grilled chicken my husband had a burger.  Our waiter was very good.  Gave us just the right amount of attention and was very professional. I liked how they text you when your table is ready; thought that was a good idea. Now for the bad. The place is dirty.  First table we were sat at was very dirty.  Second table was a bit cleaner.  All around us we saw people asking to have their tables cleaned.  Don't they bus their tables. We were seated at a half booth.  My husband was just standing there because he did not have a chair.  They finally brought one. The music.  It was blasting.  Really, really blasting.  When my husband asked if it could be turned down, the manager acted like it was a big deal.  But he did it.  Funny thing is, the music was turned down about 3 more times while we were there.  You want background music not concert level music.  Wonder how many wrong orders are taken because the server can't hear the order.

Scenario 2: The weekend's here, the game's on, but I've been in the house all morning -- time to head out and rejoin civilization.  I throw on a jersey, hop in the car, turn a couple corners, and there I am, pulling into the Chili's parking lot.  As soon as I walk through the doors, my eyes are on the big screen and I head right to the bar, sit down, get some hot and fresh tortilla chips, a bowl of the best salsa this side of the border, and a double-serving of my favorite ice-cold draft.  The crowd starts pouring in and soon the bar is electrified, as if we were all at the game, high-fiving in the stands.  I love this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington?start=40

The chipotle chicken crispers get spicier and greasier every time to cover up the lack of actual flavor, not to mention it seems like we are getting one crisper less every time we are there.

Eric C.,"Wellington, FL",57,3,,2.0,2/1/2017,"Went to Chili's this evening. I used to love the chain. The menu had changed a lot over the years. What was once a comfortable eatery is now LOUD with rock music playing constantly with mediocre but expensive food.  The waitress was nice enough, even though she neglected refilling my iced tea. She took about 15 minutes from the time we got the bill to the time she got around to actually taking payment (which had been on the table that entire 15 minutes). Meanwhile, as the music was turned up to the point my wife and I could no longer hear each other talk, my wife felt compelled to wait outside until the waitress collected payment. She waited in the cold for an additional 10 minutes. I waited at the table alone, no refill on the iced tea and the waitress ignoring me as I tried to get her attention to take my freaking payment.  The food was slightly above average, but I was still hungry after the dinner. Smaller portions than before.  We won't be going back any time soon. There are way better places to go, and for less money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington?start=20
Wendy B.,"Wellington, FL",61,254,241,3.0,3/7/2016,"2 for 1 drinks and free chips and salsa keeps me coming back.  I wanted  to like their flatbreads but we tried 2 of them and found them greasy. We got the pick 3 with mexican and I got tostada (liked it a lot) and a taco that was ok husband got enchilada maybe.  Not as good as the authentic Mexican food places we have around here, but OK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington?start=20
Mark M.,"West Palm Beach, FL",72,45,186,5.0,3/18/2016,"First off, Samantha (tall blonde waitress), is STELLAR at what she does! She anticipates needs, and moves with a sense of urgency! My 4 favorite things at Chili's Wellington location are: the quick and friendly staff, SKILLET QUESO, Southwestern Egg-rolls, and the Margarita-Lime Grilled Chicken entree... With all four of these, they'll ALWAYS have me coming back. As a guest of a sit-down, dine-in restaurant, I prefer to be in and out in less than an hour(so I know what I want when I get there). I am a busy guy, I don't have time to sit around forever. Samantha BLEW my mind today and she will make your day! Check it out",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington?start=20
Luly I.,"Lake Worth, FL",0,3,,1.0,12/15/2016,"Unsatisfactory service was given to my friend and I at this Chilis. When we first arrived the waitress was very complementary but as soon as a group of sheriffs arrived to eat, we were forgotten. We had to wait an hour to receive our food and weren't even asked if we wanted dessert and didn't receive an apology for the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington?start=20
Michael P.,"Boca Raton, FL",4,3,2,2.0,2/8/2016,"I've dined at this Chili's on several occasions.  The service and quality was the same each time.  The service was decent, 3 of 5.  The food was mediocre, another 3 of 5.  What bothers me the most about this Chili's is they water down their alcohol...a lot.  I like to start my meal with a drink to help unwind after a busy day.  I prefer a straight-up double shot of either tequila or vodka.  On every visit to this Chili's, the shots were so watered down that I could barely detect the alcohol.  I pour my own at home.  I do know how it's supposed taste (and burn).  These are shots mind you, not mixed drinks and no ice.  I gave this Chili's several chances, but finally gave up on the place.  The bar gets 0 out of 5 for ripping me off.  If you order a shot here, forego the chaser, you won't need it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington?start=20
R T.,"Lake Worth, FL",8,11,3,2.0,12/29/2015,"Had dinner with the family here tonight. The evening started off great until the food came out. My husband ordered fajitas that when they were brought out looking more like boiled meat than fajitas.  Then had to wait for condiments. No sizzle no color to the meat. I ordered the sour cream enchiladas with extra sauce. My order came out with no sauce. When I told the waitress I asked for extra sour cream sauce she brought me out cold sour cream. When I clarified that I wanted sour cream sauce she brought me out cold sauce. After asking for the manager she had my plate redone.  I did have to sit and wait for the remake while my whole family ate their food and then proceed to eat alone when the food finally made it out to the table. What left me the most flabbergasted was that after all that hassle, wait and inconvenience to the customer the manager choose to not take the enchiladas off the ticket nor did she offer a free dessert or anything to make up for the trouble.  Very disappointing service.  Will probably not go back to this location. Attached are before and after pictures of my plate what I got and what I should have gotten. UPDATE (1/25/16): No one contacted me about this I guess Chili's doesn't mind losing this customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington?start=20
Michelle M.,"Wellington, FL",48,235,332,4.0,3/13/2014,"Chain or not, I'm a sucker for a Chili's and they can really vary wildly on location. This is a great location. We have been here several times and never had a problem. This one is clean, the service is excellent, and the food above average.  They don't have a great beer selection, but their 2 for 1 happy hour all the time is pretty great. I really like their original chicken crispers and the skillet chocolate chip cookie dessert is awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington?start=20

Chris G.,"Wellington, FL",9,11,1,4.0,4/4/2016,Great food a lot of choices on the two for twenty.   Service was great in the bar. The 2 for one drinks were a little week.    So we went with the premium.    They need to clean the bathrooms an put them on a schedule to be clean.   All in all great time,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington?start=20
Crafty C.,"Wellington, FL",0,3,,3.0,4/5/2015,The food is okay. But the service at the curbside pickup STINKS! you wait forever for someone to notice you and end up going inside anyway.  The food is cold like it has been sitting. That is one of my biggest pet peeves. If it doesn't take 30 minutes to make then don't say come in 30 minutes unless you're going to cook it right before I get there! Other restaurants don't seem to have a problem with this.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington?start=20
Britney R.,"Loxahatchee, FL",1,8,3,4.0,11/22/2014,"Out of all the times I've been to this chilis (which is quite a bit because I live across the street from it) this has without a doubt been the best visit for my husband and I. Joey is probably the best waiter I've had. You never had to flag him down and he paid very close attention. My husband and I never even had to ask for a refill. Before our drinks were empty he would come out with the refill. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because one of the managers brought out my food. Notice how I said 'my' and not 'our'. This chilis is normally pretty busy so I understood but really? Joey came back over shortly after and noticed my husband didn't get his food and immediately got on top of that.  Honestly, unless he's there I don't think I'll be coming in haha!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington?start=20
M D.,"Greenacres, FL",0,10,,1.0,4/8/2015,"Really disappointed, second time that I've had some sort of big piece of nerve and fat in the enchiladas, that is a big turn off...
