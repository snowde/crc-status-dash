Shian N.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",101,12,21,2.0,8/16/2016,"My boyfriend and I come here time to time for dinner and mainly get items from their 2 for $20 menu. It's all tasty.  I've always disliked the condition the seats, booths and tables are in. Last time I was here the table was not wiped from previous diners and whatever they left got on my hands and menu. The menu sort of wreaked too. The booths are old and ripped  and the seats feel lumpy. Not comfy.  Service is always good. Very attentive. I don't think we'll be back too often just because I couldn't get too comfy because of cleanliness.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=20

Why do I say that? I'll tell you why,  From the moment I sat down in the bar area she acknowledge me and let me know she'll be right with me so I was just waiting wondering where and when so I'm going to come and take my order for my meal. ReAnna was attentive, kind and came back more the once to check on if I everthing was ok or If I needed anything else. She showed and explained to me the fancy high tech menu thing on the table. Point is even though the was kinda full,, she did not forget about me. This time I order the Triple Dipper and the White Spinish Queso, both I would recommend.

Neicha S.,"Granada Hills, CA",246,5,1,1.0,12/21/2016,"My wife and I will never be returning to this Chili's location. Andrew the  ""Manager"" has a horrible disposition and the service is just as bad.  We visited this location today 12/21/16 for dinner. We were excited to try the new smokehouse items they have available. It took 15 minutes to actually get our order in because our server just didn't return to take our order and to add insult to injury people that were sat well after we were, not only got their food, they seemed to get much better service than we were receiving.  When we finally got our food, it was though it had been sitting for quite sometime and was at best luke warm. It took another 10 minutes for the server to return so that we could have some fresh food brought out. She took our fries and never returned. I had to get up and request a manager to come speak with us. Insert Andrew the rude manager! He approached the table with an attitude and spoke to us with such a condescending tone, and asked if wanted to box our food up that was cold and not very good. Why would we want to take anything home? Andrew was extremely rude and borderline disrespectful telling us ""we could just get up and go now"" and blaming the horrible service on the holidays (the restaurant wasn't very busy at all). This is not how you handle a customer complaint and problem. They need to retrain these servers and managers immediately!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=20
Tom C.,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA",9,78,216,3.0,3/4/2017,"I read their story of how Chilis got started and sigh with the disappointment of what corporate America and greed can do to ruin what once was a dream.  That said, my last experience was decent, which has been the complete opposite of all my previous experiences.  This time, we had an attentive server that kept the (not complimentary) drink and chips and salsa coming, though I really hate their ""Pace Picante"" like salsa.  Our food was good, which has in previous been the low points of the meal.  Wife's tacos were really messy but good.  My kids quesadilla and mini burger were generic, and my baby back platter was above average.  I really liked their roasted corn.  I had some Be My Guest cards, which is the only reason why I came back.  But this time it was not too shabby!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=20

Ronin E.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,317,156,4.0,11/29/2015,"Been here many times, the food is always good, never a problem but a recurring theme is the disaster of the men's room and I keep hoping for a change but there never is. Tonight I finally said something. I was taking my two daughters to bathroom and, surprising... not an ounce of toilet paper on either roll, no toilet liners either. Apparently all of the tp was on the ground and the garbage can was spilling onto the floor. I can't show all of the disgusting 'stuff' but I'm attaching pix of it toned down.  The frustration was that I told the workers before we sat down to eat, because the kids had to go first. They said it would be taken care of. About an hour later, they had to go again. The floor was cleaned-up but still... no toilet paper or liners!  Come on management, this is unacceptable and, without fail, it's ALWAYS the same situation EVERY time I come here. Send someone in every 30 minutes to check.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=20
Jae J.,"Porter Ranch, Los Angeles, CA",35,129,84,3.0,6/15/2016,"Chili's is not somewhere I go expecting amazing food and service. I usually get take out at every location because it's the safest and quickest way to go. I'm usually a TGI fridays person, but hadn't been to chili's in a few years. Doordash to the rescue.  So...game 5 of the NBA finals, wanted food but wanted to be in my living room. I went with the triple dipper appetizer and 1/2 rack of craft beer ribs. A lot has changed on the menu (WHY did they get rid of the chicken with the bacon, cheese, and green onions?! It was amazing), but the ribs were great. I chose corn and loaded mashed potatoes and as usual, no disappointments there. As for the triple dipper, I chose big mouth bites, boneless honey-chipotle wings, and crispy cheddar bites. The first two were good, with the boneless wings being the best and I wish i would have just gotten those and the sliders. The crispy cheddar bites are disgusting and not crispy. Nor were they hot.  All in all, ill come here every once in a blue moon still, but not something to rave about since they have gone pretty much strictly tex-mex and low calorie for their menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=20
Victor S.,"Tujunga, CA",6,7,21,1.0,3/6/2017,"Worst Chili's ever! Total meltdown. Sunday night 7:30. Dirty uncleared tables all around. Kitchen looked like a tornado went through, wet floors, trash, food on floor, looked gross. The wait for the food was totally unacceptable! We almost walked out! Restrooms were discusting, trash can overflowing, paper toweles in urinal, just filthy. This Chili's was totally overwhelmed, mismanaged and understaffed. The servers were working hard trying to keep up. Never saw busboys. Servers were trying to clear tables. Felt sorry for the employees. The owners should really take a look at this Chili's! We won't be back! Now we are scared to eat at any Chili's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=20
Stan C.,"Henderson, NV",135,380,203,4.0,4/26/2016,"My wife and I  came for dinner with our two young granddaughters. I had gotten an email with a coupon that kids eat free with an adult entree. My wife and I really enjoy Chili's fajitas. So we got dinner for two for twenty bucks. We each got the chicken fajitas. My granddaughter's each had a child's meal at no charge. All in all, dinner for 4 for twenty bucks. Now that's a great deal. Ambience: typical Chili's restaurant. The booths are large. The restaurant is clean. Lots of TVs throughout the restaurant. In addition, each table has an iPad type device that allows you to view the menu and pay your bill. But more importantly when you're there with young children, there are video games that are appropriate for fairly young children to play for a nominal fee ( unlimited games for $2). A big hit with my granddaughters. Service: the service tonight was exceptional. Our server, Jacqueline, was to our table within minutes of our seating. She brought our drinks promptly. The service was well-paced. In addition, we had a minor problem. The manager, Jen , came over and handled it in an extremely professional way leaving us very happy. Food: The 2 for $20 comes with an appetizer to share .  We chose  the  guacamole and chips .  A huge portion  of chips with a very generous portion of guacamole and an equally generous portion of salsa. Way more than anyone should eat as an appetizer.  And the guac was delicious. The fajitas consist of a fairly generous portion of grilled chicken, grilled green peppers, and side dish with guacamole, sour cream, cheese, salsa, and chopped tomatoes. Really tasty and portion size large enough to bring home for tomorrow's lunch. Value: when four people can enjoy a dinner for $20 plus have leftovers for the next day, that's a great value. I will be coming back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=20
Noesh H.,"Woodland Hills, CA",18,115,203,5.0,6/11/2016,"My neighborhood Chilli's! It's a pretty solid restaurant, with a lot of options. Great place for families. Food is pretty good, and the customer service is always amazing. To-go food is also very efficient, although very time consuming. They say the food will be ready in 15 minutes but really it's 30 minutes! The best thing about this restaurant is their chocolate molten lava cake. It's probably the best dessert known to man. Hard chocolate coating over a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of hot fudge brownie. Does not get any better than that! A couple of my favorite entrees here are: Baby back (BBQ) ribs, fajita trio (Steak, shrimp, chicken), shrimp Cajun pasta, and the original battered chicken crispers with a side of loaded mash with all of those items. Not to mention their mango ice tea is really really good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=20
Loves Food D.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,52,,1.0,10/5/2017,"I remember years ago Chilis was the place to go when i wanted to have a special mother/daughter bonding time prior to us going wheat and gluten free. Last night we decided to go with the whole family and it was nothing like I remembered. We asked the server if they have gluten free menu and he gave us this list of which dish has no wheat in it, very slim picking. So we ordered GRILLED chicken for our son, steak for our daughter, salad for me and fajitas for hubby. The kids food came first which was great except they gave my son this deep fried chicken with tons of batter on it. Told the server (AGAIN) we have wheat allergies and we ordered grilled. He took it back and we had to wait another 10 mins. My salad came along with the grilled chicken which is so microscopic that my son asked for dinner after he ate his dinner! Mind you my son is a light eater and it didnt even fill him up. Once everyone was done with their meal, hubby's fajita finally came with FLOUR tortillas. No regards to allergy at all here. His $17 fajitas also had tiny portions. He was only able to eat half of it as we were all still starving so we were picking at his plate. All in all it was a true disappointment to come here and waste all that money for HORRENDOUS service, baby portions and zero regards to people's allergies. The whole family agreed that we will NOT be coming back....sad!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=20
Brian C.,"San Diego, CA",169,192,16,2.0,3/27/2016,"Standard Chili's with a few issues. They served me beef fajitas that were partially raw and bloody. Instead of replacing the dish they made me scrape the beef onto a side plate, then they brought it back and left me to dump it back on my skillet. Oh yeah, they charge extra if you want beans or rice with your fajitas. That's a weak move.  Server was nice and we were seated quickly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=20

Mark R.,"West Hills, CA",0,11,2,1.0,9/29/2017,"Went there on a Monday evening around 7. The place was pretty empty, except for the bar area. Took a while for the hostess to show up and seat us. Took another 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge we were there. There were only 4 tables with patrons, but no servers to be found. We had actually thought about getting up and leaving, when a server finally showed up. He indicated that he had very needy customers and that was why it took him so long. The server was pleasant and the food was okay. But, service took a long time and refills were scarce. Don't know what has happened to this location, but probably explains why it was so empty. Hope they improve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=20
Aryo S.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",420,233,778,4.0,1/11/2018,"---INFO, VIBE & SERVICE--- Your usual reasonable chain restaurant. The bar is usually a happening spot, and of course the dining area side will depend on times and days. Of course it's a casual place with a similar look and feel to other locations....so there's that.  I've had good service the times I've been with a nice greet at the door, and nice servers/bartenders. To help with service they use the tabletop ordering tablets for ordering, paying bills, and more. So that helps with somethings.  Lots of parking around available in the lot.  ---FOOD & PRICES--- I've been coming for some years every now and then, and I can't really say I've had bad times or bad food.  I'm a sucker for the Triple Dipper. Three appetizers featured with some dipping sauces.  Somethings I like: Boneless wings and bone in wings Southwestern eggrolls - crispy flour tortillas filled with chicken, black beans, corn, cheese, red pepper, and spinach.  Nachos - These are individual pieces of tortillas with the ingredients on each one (chicken, cheeese, beans, jalapenos, queso) Texas cheese fries - How can you not like cheese fries?! Skillet queso Big mouth bites I usually mess around with appetizers when I come and some drinks so I can't say much about the entree's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills
Laksh M.,"San Jose, CA",64,73,35,3.0,12/11/2017,"This is going to be a weird review.  We didn't have to wait for a table, we were seated right away. Our waiter was super nice and helpful, only thing was it felt like he was rushing with us... My dad was in the restroom and my mom did state we wanted to wait for him but still the waiter just stood there to ask us for our order.  After taking our order he just stood there because we only order 3 huge plates (we were a party of 5) and made it seem like it was weird to share food.  When our food arrived, I forgot to ask for ranch. I waited for the waiter to come back and ask ""if everything is alright""...the waiter never came! Not all the way till we were done and paid our check through the iPad...  Overall food is very very bland, very small portions.

Jack Y.,"Canoga Park, CA",0,70,,1.0,12/6/2017,"Hello Chili's corporate...anyone home? This location is totally off track and over-rated at anything above a 1 star. Wow. Where do I begin.   Ordered a selection of appies including the onion rings, fried pickles and buffalo chicken strips. All were sent back for being over cooked and almost burnt. The replacement were mostly an insult. The chicken strips came back uncooked and drowning in sauce.  I guess they are pre-cooked are sitting by waiting for an order and only then dropped into the frier....resulting in dry and rock hard chunks of chard chicken. The onion rings came back still dry to the core but at least we're not dark coffee brown as in the first go around The pickles better but MOSTLY BATTER PIECES leaving you to dig for the actual pickles in the oily mess. Come to main dish items was not much better.    Service was a little better than the food....but only slightly. Shame.  We used to love Chili's Goodbye",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills

Raquel F.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,82,73,5.0,9/27/2017,Not sure why this location has such a bad rep. It has a huge parking lot that you can pick and choose to your liking. That is a huge perk in LA. As soon as you walk in the host greets you with a huge smile. That is a huge plus for me.  The waiter came right away and took our appetizer order and drinks. Hubby and I ordered the smothered fries. Sad to say we practically licked the plate lol. They were so good!  For our entrees we ordered the blackened salmon and the shrimp fajitas. Food was hot and delicious just as we would expect from this franchise. For dessert we had the salted caramel molten cake. It was to die for! We did not even have to wait for the waiter to ask us because we ordered it right at the table. Love that! The waiter was really nice and kept giving us refills for our drinks. It was great.

It was dinner time and we drove past this place and I  quickly talked him into giving it a try. We tried to order regular things that we thought should be good here. We know you don't go to these places for steak or seafood. We got wings, fries, and some California egg rolls.  The fries were standard, the wings were just below that and the egg rolls were bad. They looked like they were cooked from frozen cut in half then put in the oven the next day before they were served to us. The taste was ok. But I couldn't help but think of cpk and cheesecake factory ones that are similar and for the same price!  The positive side of the experience is the waitstaff.

Sally A.,"West Hills, West Hills, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/27/2017,"I don't often write reviews but after just having a terrible experience I thought I should - as a warning to all patrons. Our main server (gabby) was wonderful but even her pleasant demeanor did not make up for the food. I ordered the low calorie chicken dish (which tasted like rubber and was inedible). My son had the crispers (batter soggy). I ordered a cup of chili as I couldn't eat my dinner and that had a sour aftertaste so I couldn't eat that either.  Gabby graciously took my dinner off the bill....and all was good ....but then along came Mark who prompted this review. We paid at the table kiosk and filled in the online review and marked things less than satisfactory. He said ""oh no you can't give us that review - it impacts us"" and promptly took the console and changed my review! I took it back, and told him his logic was backward and changed the scores back again.

We were finally seated and the sever took a while to check on us.  It took Evan about 5 mins to bring waters/beer. After bringing our drinks, he took our order. It took the kitchen about 30 mins to make our dinner. The food was really good and tasteful. They messed up on my sandwich, but it was still good the way it came out.  Overall, the experience was good. The menu had a lot of food choices that look really good. I will return for their happy hour all day Sunday's!

My spouse's coconut-pineapple drink was so sweet that we couldn't even drink it. The chips were good. The salsa was good even though it looked and tasted like it had come from a jar. The guacamole didn't look or taste freshly-made. The burger and fries were very good. The fajitas were delicious, although the beef was quite tough. We received the wrong fajitas initially. They were removed before we touched them to be given to another party. The burger sat on the table for several minutes while waiting for the correct fajita order to arrive.

Eric W.,"Canoga Park, CA",166,672,148,3.0,8/11/2015,"Came here on a recommendation of the promise of a new menu and innovative tabletop kiosks that allow you to get your order faster. I've been to Chili's all over the country and know them to be in the Applebee's and TGI Fridays department. My expectations were low so there was room for improvement. We walk in the two front doors carrying a baby carrier and navigating our young child and see the host standing by the host stand patiently waiting for us. Realized that holding down the stand was more important than grabbing a door for us. Seated on the side, most tables were crowded. People like their Chili's. We got a nice big booth. They have some nice big HDTVs in the dining area so it's ideal to watch a game. We had grown-up drinks and they were fine. Meals were mediocre and I had no idea what to order. Probably should have gone with a sandwich or salad but the new smothered burritos looked good so I had one. My wife had the quesadilla salad without meat but apparently they don't take a dollar or two off the price even if you hold the protein. If I were in a part of the country without Mexican food, I'd welcome a burrito. But here, it was bland and I could find a better burrito a block or two away. Chili's is the national chain for when there are better options and you don't know the area. We live nearby and know of a several better options. The kiosk/tablet on the table is fine. They have games for kids ... or adults for $1 all you can play. Didn't do that. I used it to sign up for their rewards program. I also ordered another drink and dessert using it. Made it easier but kind of negated the server's job. She asked for a drink refill at one point but I had already told the bartender through the modern technology. Their Oreo topped molten cake, which is according to their menu and website only available for a limited time, is literally their molten cake with one Oreo cookie crushed over it. The photo looks so enticing. It was not desirable and we could be more satisfied going home and eating Oreos. Service was mediocre. I ordered twice from the machine and it felt like the server didn't come around much. I wanted water but never got the chance to order it. I don't want my Chili's. We won't be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=40
Jamie V.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,399,1198,2.0,5/25/2015,"Dear Chili's, You've changed.  It's you, not me.  The one thing I could always count on was a decent (not great, but good) Old Timer Cheeseburger.   You've revamped your menu.  Claims were made of the ""Improved"" Old Timer.  It used to have a nice soft sesame bun.  Now it comes with a trendy brioche bun.  Kinda dense.  Fries come in a trendy aluminum thing-a-ma-jig. I ordered my burger medium rare.  The burger chef at Chili's decided that wasn't going to happen and gave me a well done burger.  I should have sent it back but I've got a cold and just wanted to gobble this thing down and go back to bed and rest.  It sucked. The Queen of Reseda sabotaged herself and ordered a very wacky dish call the Quesadilla Explosion Salad.  I'll spare you the details.  It sucked.  Perhaps she should have ordered the Pizza Shooters, Shrimp Poppers, or the Extreme Fajitas.

Brian S.,"Winnetka, CA",0,586,137,1.0,5/1/2015,"Question: how much is 99 cents worth? Answer: less than a dollar. Question: How much can 99 cents cost you? Answer (preface): Last night had a perfectly acceptable meal with perfectly acceptable service.  Booths were a tad uncomfortable (seats too far from the table for a normal sized person) and the light fixture was disgustingly dirty.  But other than that it was perfectly acceptable. Until it was time to pay the bill.  Waiter disappeared and no bill was delivered.  Instead he brought a mobile terminal and said, ""Oh... this was supposed to be at your table"".  No bill and we needed to go and this terminal was staring us in the face offering to settle the tab.  So we did.  So far so good. But the tip is defaulted to 20% which made me look like a cheap-skate in front of my date as I slid it to a more reasonable number.  Not just looked like one, she actually called me one.  Thanks Chili's... you made me look like a buffoon, and a cheap one at that. Then the bill shows up with a .99 charge for using the terminal. So here's the answer:  a 3-star review is now a 1-star review (minus 1 star for each issue cited above) and I'll never suggest going to Chili's again.

There have been times though, when I've stopped in for dinner on a weekday and it's crowded and your order may get taken quick but wait times for food are long and we sometimes have to track the waitstaff down for the check at the end. Food? It's yummy, salty and calorie-laden and most people know that when they decide to go dine here. I love their burgers and Cajun chicken pasta. They also still do their dinner for 2 at $20; an appetizer to share and two entrees, a good deal if you're on a budget. I've taken advantage of the dinner for 2 during lunch hour too, so it's not limited to dinner time only.  They've serve a signature lava cake dessert here; warm chocolate cake with chocolate syrup inside and a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.

My wife ordered some kind of grilled chicken but asked that they not put the habanero drizzle on it as she just had dental work done and didn't think she could handle it. Her first bite was was an exercise in pain as they forgot and put it on anyway. It took a while to flag down our waiter and she asked that they fix her food. I was almost done eating at this point. It took quite a while to get the re-done chicken so I had long since finished my dinner and got to sit and watch her eat hers. After all the waiting she discovered that all they did was scrape the stuff off of the top but it was still screaming hot. She just dealt with it so I took her for ice cream afterwards.

Every time I've been here, everything's alway has just been average. Average food, average service, average wait time, etc.  More recently, I had great and prompt service. We ordered the Guacamole (I think it was southwestern?) and found a mysterious black thing in there about the size of a dime. We fished it out and couldn't determine what it was. We asked our waitress and she couldn't figure it out either and said, ""I think it might be meat or something"". First, I'm glad I'm not vegetarian, or I would literally freak out. Second, gross!  She took it to the back where the manager said it was ""just an old piece of avocado"". They replaced it, but I pretty much was grossed out by then, constantly checking my food for something they may have missed. Up to this day, I have no idea what that thing was. It wasn't ""mushy"" so I don't believe it was an old piece of avocado. Dish wasn't comped or anything.

I love that they still have the soup / salad lunch special. They've had it for a few years now. It's a great deal. You have your choice of soups and salads to choose from and they give you a ginormous bowl of chips with salsa. You can get unlimited refills of the soup/salad. The bf took advantage of that. He was hungry. I ordered the chicken enchilada soup with a house salad. I've always loved the chicken enchilada soup. It was tasty and satisfying.  Yum yum.  It's been a while since I've been to Chili's and I was very happy I came back.  I'll definitely make an attempt to eat during my lunch hour again.

Overall the ordered seemed like it was rushed and thrown together.  I figured I give the place the benefit of the doubt. Decided to place the same order on yesterday. Got to the restaurant in 10 min and my order was done. The waiter on the phone told me it would be approx 15-20 min. Checked to make sure my order was correct and there were boneless wings. No biggie, the waiter took the order back to correct the order. Then when I got home to eat the food , the big mouth bites were literally raw and uncooked. The patties looked like breakfast sausage; that's how undercooked it was. I just threw everything in the trash. Chilis has definitely loss major points with me.

Our waiter was friendly and had a good sense of humor.  Everyone that came by to bring food or drink had a real good attitude. Our appetizer came out missing the chicken but it was quickly corrected and 2 people apologized for it.   Having sam Adams Oktoberfest on tap is a plus by far too.  The food was pretty good. Everything came out hot and tasty. We ordered one rack of ribs with mashed potatoes and Mac n cheese and they split it for us nice and even so we could share.  We had just come in for a beer and appetizer but ended up getting more food cause everything was so good.   It was slow in there for a Friday night but I did not mind that at all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=120

The service staff can't seem to run out of opportunities to come by your table to see if everything is ok, or you needs something else. Wow, do they really pamper you and make you feel like you are a VIP.  On a recent visit I had a server whose name was Evan. OMG, he gave so much good service that at times I felt like he owned the place.

Terrible. Like chewing rubber bands. We both ordered salads. Mine was a buffalo chicken salad that was great.  The reason for 3 stars is the restaurant was filthy. The front doors were so greasy looking with finger prints everywhere. The hostess could make better use of time by wiping those doors down occasionally instead of just standing around doing nothing... Just a suggestion.  We always try to sit in the bar as its first come first served. Again, the tables felt unkept. The condiments on the table ALL felt gummy. We literally felt we needed a shower upon leaving. I don't think we will be back. Sad, because it looks as though the restaurant has just been renovated.  As a company, I would seriously look at management pertaining to these cleanliness issues.

Ilya B.,"Canoga Park, CA",33,30,48,4.0,1/17/2014,"I've never been to Chli's before, only heard about it in the movies like ""Hall Pass"". So I've decided to try it and went there for my lunch break. My waitress, Kasi, was very nice, sweet and professional. She got my order right away and brought it to my table as soon as it was ready. I wish more wait staff was like her. I've ordered lunch combo: Salad, Chicken Sandwich and fries. They didn't have Caesar salad in the lunch menu, but Kasi told me that I could still order it and it wouldn't be a problem.  The salad was good, fresh romaine lettuce, cheese, croutons and dressing, as soon as I finished that Kasi brought me the sandwich and fries.  I was really surprised to see only 10 (TEN) potato strips on my plate :) It was kind of funny though, 'cause you'd think if you're going to serve someone fries, you could at LEAST cut up and fry one whole potato :) Seriously, I've never seen smaller side order of fries :) It didn't bother me that much though. The sandwich was VERY good. The chicken was just off the grill, seared on the outside, juicy on the inside. I don't know what sauce did they use, but it went very well with grilled chicken. I loved it. The sandwich was A+, I will definitely come back for more. The only problem that I had with my order was WATER! It was UNFILTERED, tap water. I know it's free and I shouldn't expect much, but I shouldn't be drinking water with chlorine dioxide taste ... My best guess is that they haven't changed their water filter in a while, so I asked Kasi to bring me Iced Tea and take away that horrible water.

Ritu G.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,9,,2.0,10/27/2012,"I wasn't expecting a gourmet meal...but when you're hungry and in a crunch, what can you do? As far as chain restaurants go, Chili's is usually pretty decent.  They seated us right away, which was great but it took awhile for the waiter to come and take our orders.  We had my one-year old nephew with us, so we needed to get a kids meal for him. We ordered the mac and cheese, which was basically boxed kraft mac and cheese. Don't get me wrong, growing up I used to love that stuff but I just feel like they could have had their own homemade type of deal. So we ordered our drinks and our meals. Luckily we asked to put a rush on the kids meal because my nephew was getting hungry. Good thing we did because our meal took another maybe 20 minutes after his meal came out. I started picking at the mac and cheese...what could I do?  Here's the kicker though... Finally our meals came out and we started to eat when I saw something crawling down the wall from the corner of  my eye. When I looked over I didn't see anything but I asked my sister-in-law who had a better angle to see behind the stuff on the table. She definitely saw something. Of course, I slid over to the opposite end of the table as far as I could go. She told me not to think about it, but I couldn't help it. Finally the little creature landed on the table. It had two really long antennae. We tried to get the waiter's attention, which eventually he did and grabbed the bug with the napkins sitting on the table.  Eek. Not what I had in mind when I went out to eat.  A few minutes later, another person came out and asked me if I was ok. She didn't introduce herself so I didn't know if she was a manager but she did apologize for the incident and said they were going to call an exterminator right away. I know this sounds snotty but I was really hoping they would have somehow compensated for the meal-perhaps a free dessert or drinks? When you go to a restaurant, you go not only for the food, but the experience...and this was not a good one.  Aside from the bug incident, not once did a waiter come to ask how our meals were, if we needed refills on anything and when we needed our check I needed to find someone who was not our waiter since he was MIA for a good part of the meal.  I'm ranting, I know but I had to do it....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=140

It's forsure pre-made and maybe fresh diced tomato and onions mixed into it.

When it crosses the border is when 4 minutes later those empty booths magically became available, just not for us.

So when Chad says he wants to make things right with customers that might have had a bad experience, he means it and takes care of it. I will be back to location with my family like we have many times in the past. Just very happy and pleased all the issues got fixed because I always loved this Chili's and didn't want to have to drive the extra miles to go to the Northridge location. Thanks again Chad S. Your customer service is great and keep up the good work! And Anthony is a great waiter and should be considered for management in the future.  Hope to see you there next time so I can shake your hand.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=180

They also moved our table in the middle of our meal so they could accommodate a bigger crowd that was coming for their birthday.  The Manager came over to apologize. They even gave us free Desert but after all of it we all ended up getting stomach aches and diarrhea.

We got seated right away, drinks were brought to us quickly - with refills. The place was clean, and our waitress was nice enough. I shared their Triple Dipper platter with my boyfriend. It's an appetizer where you get to pick any three of the choices offered. We had the Southwestern egg rolls, Boneless Buffalo Wings, and Honey-Chipotle Chicken Crispers. The egg rolls were a bit spicy, but really flavorful; the wings were good; and the chicken crispers were ok. I didn't care for the honey-chipotle sauce, it was almost as if they didn't mix it enough because some bites would be only honey flavor, and other bites would be only chipotle flavor. Maybe the original would've tasted better. I asked for extra sides of ranch for the table, which we got, but one of them was blue cheese. Personally, I HATE blue cheese so it came as quite the unpleasant surprise when I dipped my egg roll into it and started chewing. Anybody could make that mistake since they both look alike, but still you don't pay to have your order be incorrect.

I always order take out and it's never ready on time. And several times I've seen other customers pissed off that it's taking long and usually their orders are wrong. Tonight, we ordered an appetizer and two entrees. My husband got tilapia and corn, and I got ribs and fries (he eats like a girl). Everything was COVERED in pepper.

Appetizer samplers are a decent way to go.  And, I found it ironic that in all these years, I have never tried the chili at Chili's.  It was actually pretty good.  It tasted slow-cooked and had nice chunks of beef.  It was served with too much cheese, for me anyway, and with onions and jalapenos on the side.

Danis H.,"San Gabriel, CA",4,6,,1.0,2/16/2013,"I would give this place a ""0"" star, but Yelp doesn't let me.  I'll just add to the list or horrible reviews for this ill-fated restaurant. I have never had a worse experience with customer service in any restaurant than at the Chili's at West Hills.  I went in on a wednesday night and ordered the $20 meal for 2.  Our server seemed somewhat friendly, but was very pushy about ordering drinks.  During our entire meal, only once did he, server ""Wood"", ever come by and offer to refill our drinks.  It was nearly 10pm by this time and there were almost no more customers.  I mean, who else could he be waiting on?  A table across from us left and there were only 2-3 tables now.  I noticed another server had picked up Wood's tip and brought it to the back.  When Wood came back, he was confused and thought the patrons had left without paying.  Puzzled and frantic, he went to speak with the other waiters to find out that another employee had already finalized their bill.  I never had a good vibe with Wood.  At the get go, there was something peculiar about his actions.  At the end of my meal, I paid him a fair tip for his more than lack luster service.  I felt that I was generous, but he obvious didn't.  I never ever check my receipts at the end of the day or week to find out if the posted tip on my credit card matches what I wrote for the waiter.  But something about our server Wood made me think differently.  The next night, I checked the posted amount and lo and behold, the TOTAL AMOUNT DUE was NOT THE SAME.  He changed my tip and deceitfully added an EXTRA $10 for himself.  I wasn't all that surprised because of his interactions with me and the other customers.  I just didn't trust him. Side:  I couldn't figure out why the server WOOD would dare to cheat someone and add a $10 TIP to a $20 meal?  Have some common sense.  Obviously, my total amount would be around $25, not $35.   I called the manager, Chris, and reported the problem.   He said he would call back.  Chris never called me back.  Strike 1.  I called and he told me that ""Well, he kinda put a ""1"" in front of your tip.  You can tell he changed it, and also changed your total amount.""   I asked: ""What are you going to do about it?"" Manager: ""Well, we can give you $10 credit or $10 coupon.  Which option would you like?"" Me: I was thinking are you serious.  Why would I ever want to come back to Chili's again.  Did you even have to give me an option.  I might as well give you my bank account number.  And seriously, just $10 credit for the all crap you put me through?!?  STRIKE 2. Me: ""I'll just take the $10 credit.""  Trying to hide my frustration.       ""What are you guys going to do with the server?"" Manager:  Oh, well, we.. uhm.. we have to look into it. Me (Thinking): Look into what! You already told me that your CROOK server changed my tip amount.  That is ILLEGAL.  It is a CRIME.  6 days later: I patiently waited for a credit back to my card.  However, I never received one.  I called Chili's and spoke with Chris and he informed me that he needed my credit card # to process the refund through accounting.  Well why didn't he tell me 6 days ago!!  I have to personal call just to get my money back.  This is ridiculous.   I asked for cash instead, and he responds, ""Well, I can't, I have to ask my general manager, and he doesn't come in until tomorrow.""  Then take the darn initiative to call him. He abruptly hangs up before I do.  They lack even simple customer service.  STRIKE 3!   I know these managers could care less about their jobs.  To them, it's EXACTLY that: JUST A JOB to make ends meet.  If they truly cared about their job, I wouldn't have to waste my time.  All the time spent typing this review and getting my money back won't be in VAIN if all of you Chili's patrons don't ever visit their restaurant AGAIN!   If you want to keep your money, then stay away.  If you feel like donating your hard earned money to despicable and conniving servers, then visit this Chili's at your discretion.  But you've been WARNED!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=200

Ok service totally sucked...the waiter never brought out my dinner salad and later almost after my dinner had the balls to ask If I still wanted it!!! Told him no and as we got the check the wife had me check and sure enough the salad was not taken off...just lazy. On to the food...I used to get the ribs here until the quality went way downhill a few years ago...so now I order triple dipper for dinner cause the southwest eggrolls are really good, get it with boneless wings and chicken crispers, the crispers were filled with grease and soggy...nasty best thing about meal was when we left and made a family pact not to ever return to this west hills location EVER again!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=200
Tigran C.,"West Hills, CA",20,39,28,3.0,3/11/2010,"This place is down the street from my house and I've been coming here for years. I was solo this time (like a chump) so I sat in the bar area where it's self seating. My table and menu were a little dirty, but it Chillis so I wasnt expecting anything more. The chick serving was very prompt and polite. I ordered the ribeye medium rare, which came out very good minus a little bit of gristle. Also, I don't know how or why, but Chillis has the greatest mashed potatoes every. It comes with the whacky black pepper gravy that would taste good on my shoe. Altogether, pretty decent steak and beer for sub $30.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=200
Michael W.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",65,8,,4.0,9/7/2011,"My roommate eat here at least twice a week. The service is good and friendly. The food is mostly fried but the steak, shrimp and chicken trio is AWESOME! I also enjoy the fresh salmon and shrimp combo with loaded mashed potato's. And I like to end the meal with a nice piece of cheese cake. If you drink there is a full bar for those to enjoy more than just a glass of wine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=200
Michael D.,"Calabasas, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/13/2012,"after 5 minutes of waiting, we left! no service at all! this place has horrible service. sat in a loud corner near a big party of people, didn""t even get drinks. or anything. i was giving this place 1 more chance after 1 year ago when the manager quickly left burn food in front of me and i had to chase her down as she ignored me calling her from right behind. and then served us burned food again. what can i say i give up. we have no good chili's restaurants in the san fernando valley! this suck!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=200

Raul H.,"West Hills, CA",132,20,15,4.0,8/16/2011,"Love the Mini Burgers! We get Take-Out here a lot. Usually the service is top notch, but every now and then they forget something. The food is always good though :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=200
Anthony B.,"West Hills, CA",43,60,5,4.0,4/18/2011,"Despite a lot of negative reviews about this particular Chili's, my experiences have been pretty good.  My food has consistently been cooked to order, waiting to be served was never too long, and the waiters/waitresses have always been kind and helpful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=200
Eli G.,"Los Angeles, CA",2607,1293,3436,2.0,12/17/2007,"a couple of my friends throughout the years have raved to me about chili's burgers. how good they are, how big they are and how i ""really need to try it."" i avoided it like the plague since i generally know how these kind of burgers are. so while seeing a friend in woodland hills, she decided that we should go to chili's and i obliged.  i think we went on a friday or saturday night because it was packed! not surprising though, all these chain places fill up on weekends. we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, again pretty normal.  finally seated, i know i want a burger. i decide on chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger. sounds good right? i beg the server to have it cooked less than medium, no go. my friend gets a steakie thing. food comes out pretty quick and i dive into my burger. oh god not again! another dry, bland, not juicy, not seasoned, over cooked, over priced burger. the only saving grace was the bacon was excellent and the burger was a little greasy, that helped make up for the lack of quality burger juice. and size wise, i was expecting a much larger patty for something dubbed ""big mouth burger"" but no, just a thin little burger king patty.  i always knew my ""friends"" that loved chili's were idiots, but now it's official. at least i don't have to go there ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=200
Jon G.,"Winnetka, CA",37,72,49,3.0,1/5/2011,Chilis is a go to place in a pinch always know what you will get.  The burgers are big and tasty and for a chain the Mephis dry rub ribs are very good.  Also the kids menu has a good variety of choices.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=200
Khurram N.,"Los Angeles, CA",90,113,,3.0,2/20/2008,"After thousands of years in a vacuum, Chili's has started making broad strokes in revising their menu.  If you haven't been recently, the smokehouse burgers are a new addition that was surprisingly good.  I got the jalapeo version and it was delicious.  Another new dish that I liked was the buffalo chicken fajita.   Be aware, though, that something about Chili's alters people's interactions.  You'll remember from the Office that Michael Scott makes some of his best sales deals are brokered at Chili's.  Well, in my experience, the truth comes out at Chili's.  So, if you're trying to avoid telling your girl she needs to lose some weight, avoid Chili's; it's like sodium penathol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=200
Jason P.,"Sacramento, CA",211,193,1,4.0,12/17/2009,"Chili's in general are starting to up their game. The menus have better choices of food and actually seem to taste better. I dined at this location recently and it was pretty decent. It was a week night, so it wasn't too busy, which means good and speedy service. The food was pretty good, no complaints there. Reason I gave it 4 stars and not five is that I had to keeping reminding my waitress of certain things, she was pretty forgetful. but other then that she was cool.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=200
Nicole K.,"Minneapolis, MN",1,7,,2.0,9/9/2010,"Food's alright, I guess. Edible. But what really irks me about this place is how I never get seated. I've come to this location maybe three times in the past year and a half, and each of those times, the seater just refused to seat me. I have no idea why. One time, the excuse was that the hostess forgot to write my name. And another time, the hostess forgot that we were waiting. And the last time, we made sure that the hostess wrote our name, and I went up to make sure that she knew we were waiting...and she still sat three parties that came in after us before us. And these three parties were the same size as ours.... I have no idea??!! I swear I'm not on the FBI 10 Most Wanted. And I swear I've never done anything horrible to anybody here. I've never had some massive diva-fit. So I dunno....I hate it when people play the race card, but this place is starting to make me feel paranoid about being asian? hmm. interesting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=200
