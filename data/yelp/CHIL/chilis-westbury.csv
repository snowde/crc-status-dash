There were 10 or more tables open, so I asked the young lady why aren't we sitting she replied the ""guy"" has to assign the seats which I replied I been here 35 minuets and I have seen the freakin ""guy"" yet.

Mark C.,"BAYSIDE, NY",0,4,,5.0,10/3/2017,Best ribs on Long Island  The 2 for $22 dinner is a great value.  The salad is fresh & large Chili's is only place I go for ribs.

Carissa M.,"Elmont, NY",214,27,27,4.0,9/8/2017,"Went here today before class. My server was generally nice. She kept the conversation short and just took my order(I already knew what I wanted anyway) food came out quickly and it was okay.  It's really quiet during lunchtime so I assume that's why I was serviced so promptly. Come here from 11-4 to get the lunch special deals!  My salad was great, but the lettuce tasted kind of metallic ( if that makes sense). The margarita flatbread is my absolute favorite because of the aioli that's drizzled on top.  Generally it was a typical corporate restaurant experience, nothing really special though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westbury
Sherry S.,"Valley Stream, NY",60,62,80,4.0,12/10/2017,"Came with a party of 6; 4 adults and 2 kiddies, Around 10pm last night. The server was efficient and friendly, especially with the kids. Food and drinks came fast and were pretty yummy. Chili's had twofers, I'm all in there with the mango and blackberry margaritas. Haha. The table had; steak nachos, fajitas, chipotle ribs which were all pretty good. My brother loves a good burger but he wasn't crazy about their Old Fashion burger. One kid liked his Mac and cheese but my godson didn't like his Popcorn chicken looking meal, he said it was too dry (it was).  Another server was cleaning around and was kind of rude and gave us a non working mini kiosk thing that you can play games and pay the bill with. Overall, our server was efficient, kind, patient and attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westbury
Deborah M.,"Yulee, FL",956,462,3371,3.0,8/31/2017,"I have not been to Chili's in years but we popped in here for a quick snack before a movie. Well anyway, since a salad of some sort was on my mind I ordered this tex-mex bowl of sorts with chicken. When it arrived all I could think of was what is this????? This is the ugliest most unappealing bowl of I dont know what the hell I ordered.  I was able to see the avocado, there was a slice of chicken, a smear of sour cream, tortilla chips (maybe), corn, lettuce, cheese...and I dont know what else was thrown...and I do mean thrown in the bowl.  Someone in the back just must have been grabbing a little bit of everything and said oh that looks texmexy. If I had been making this dish at home I would have called it refrigerator buffet salad. Open the fridge throw it in a bowl...close the door and eat it.  Time being short, I did eat this gastronomic excursion with hopes I would not get sick. It was ok/tolerable. I will wait another 10 years before my next visit to Chili's.  The end.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westbury

Rashid M.,"New York, NY",1098,933,574,4.0,1/23/2017,"I've been to this Chili's many times now. It's always crowded here so there's always a long wait to get seated. Luckily last time we found a high table by the bar area, so we didn't have to wait long. I ordered the Prime Rib Fresh Mex Bowl, and I have to admit, it was better than I expected. I didn't think that I would like the prime rib with the avocado, but everything went together well. I also had the steak here once, but I didn't like it, so I wouldn't recommend it.

Leo A.,"OZONE PARK, NY",1,18,16,1.0,6/7/2017,"I normally don't go to large chain restaurants and chili's reminded me why! The waiter and service was decent, the restaurant wasn't crowded and there wasn't a wait at all. But the food was another story.  When the food arrived it was unbelievable, everything was cold. Three of the six dishes we ordered came too cold to eat, and we had to wait until they waiter brought out new dishes. I've never been to chili's and got served fajitas that wasn't sizzling, in face this time I think my fajitas was still frozen! To top it off the brought out the dessert without spoons, and by the times the spoons arrived the ice cream already melted. If only my food was as hot as the dessert.  The waiter promised the manager would stop by, and he never did. I guess we weren't important enough. Between the cold food and the cold manager, I would never eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westbury
Alexandra D.,"Long Beach, NY",172,240,1474,4.0,5/29/2016,I really love the honey BBQ chicken crispers and the margaritas. I think the fact that they have all day 2 fers really makes them a better value than Applebee's or Friday's.  They lost a star because the bar is made of a weird material that feels DISGUSTING. It's sticky and feels moist. It's porous so it feels like it absorbs dirt and grime. Ew. Don't sit here. Also the water from this location tastes nasty. I'm an avid 5 bottles of water a day gal so when I order water anywhere I can sense a dirty ice maker. This place has the oddest tasting water ice had in a loooong time.

Soon as we'd get about 1/2 way on our drinks, she was there with refills, the food was awesome! I ordered the old fashioned cheese burger and it was yummy, the wife had a ribeye and it was cooked perfect! The endless nacho appetizer was seriously good, the boneless wings were kinda cold but they were good, needed a little more kick on the buffalo sauce, the winner in our dinner was the mango tea, I need them to sell this by the gallon! It was sooooo good! All in all is was great! If you do happen to hit up Chili's, the mango tea is like crack addictive!, next time I'm gonna do the smoked platter, I went with the burger cause the commercial I saw made the burger look like a monster!

Antoinette E.,"Oyster Bay, NY",126,56,547,3.0,4/28/2017,"My first time eating at Chili's because I was deathly afraid of the huge Chili on the outside since I was younger. Not quite sure if my phobia had a name, I just knew it was real. Some colleagues wanted to grab a quick bite for dinner. the food was pretty fair, I ordered a salad, that left quite a bit to be desired but then again it was a salad (lol).

I had a salad, half rack baby back ribs and a molten chocolate cake (which was insanely good).. all for $10! Cant beat that price anywhere.

Taurean M.,"Amityville, NY",14,23,10,1.0,9/13/2017,"I don't normally go on rants but this was a horrible experience for me and my friends when we came here for a bite to eat. The server was horrendous, it took about an hour for us to get served after he kept passing us by and ignoring us after I went about calling for his assistance multiple times. And it took another hour for us to get our food and drinks, which already offset how upset I was at the terrible service. And again after we ate and was ready for the check it was terrible. I don't know if this is a normal thing for this area or Chili's but I'm livid at the experience I had here. And while we are waiting for our food he had the nerve to sit down at a table near us and talk with his friends, they were cursing and being very loud instead of checking on our food items which was beyond disrespectful and because of this I don't think I will go to chilis again, told all my foodie and critic friends about this and they were astonished about what happened to me and my friends here. Tried to talk to the manager but he wasn't coming out from the back to talk to us. The food wasn't hot and we just had a terrible time, that is not a way to run a business nor treat paying customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westbury

Chicken and steak fajita was salty, and nothing special at all. I wish I went somewhere else for lunch. There are plenty of other restaurants in the area that would've been far better than this.  Looked and felt dirty everywhere. Servers weren't too friendly and we waited forever for our drinks. Margarita sucked.

The bartender was helpful in helping me decide what I wanted to order according to what I told her I was craving. The lady who brought me my food was cheerful & happy. My order came out perfect & the fries were fresh out of the fryer/piping hot which was more than I could have hoped for. & the bartender was available & attentive when I need salt & pepper as well as when my drink was getting low.  My experience overall could not have been more perfect.

They messed up our to go order TWO SEPARATE TIMES. When I called to speak to a manger and try to correct it, she insisted I was wrong as SHE was the one who packed the order so it MUST have been right. She would rather argue with me instead of just trying to make the situation right. Her attitude was just spilling through the phone.

Alyssa P.,"Brooklyn, NY",613,1079,2515,4.0,10/24/2015,"Y'all can call me crazy if you want - but I love Chili's!  I really do.  And right now I'm craving their buffalo chicken salad... I'm pretty sure I could live off of this salad.  All the necessary food groups are there: chicken, bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, and pico de gallo over a giant bed of lettuce.  Yum!  I do recommend skipping the ranch dressing that comes with and try the honey-lime vinagrette, its so good and keeps the salad feeling a little lighter. Hubs and I had stopped in not too long ago for an early dinner (around 4pm).  The place was half empty so we were seated right away.  Our waiter was seriously the nicest kid, a little goofy, but so nice!  We never had to ask for refills - this kid had it covered.  He even sent us home with giant to-go cups of mango iced tea. To balance our leafy salads we ordered up the Skillet Queso for an app.  The haters can say whatever they want - the skillet queso is amazing.  Cheesy, salty goodness makes my belly so happy.  The dish came out piping hot and waiter man was great about bringing us some fresh chips when he saw our basket getting low.  I love attentive waiters! And I love Chili's!   So lets recap - Mango Iced Tea with free refills, Skillet Queso and Buffalo Chicken Salad with bacon and bleu cheese.  ::happy sigh::  Go to Chili's!  If there was one closer to my apt I'd probably be there right now...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westbury?start=20

My party of 5 was seating right away on a Wednesday afternoon as the place was not busy. What won me over is their happy hour specials. Their two for 1 well drinks or discounts on their beers was pretty nice. My friends and I got the frozen mango margarita, which was pretty good. I finished mine too quickly. It was worth it though and you can taste the tequila in it which was nice.  I had gotten the chipotle chicken bowl from their lunch special ($7) and it was good. Nothing stood out to me, but it wasn't like super special. Just your standard chipotle chicken bowl. My friend had gotten the 3 for $10 lunch special which came with a HUGE amount of chips and dip, a burger, and a mini chocolate cake for the dessert. All of it looked pretty good.  The service was good and our waitress kept bringing a lot of water to our table whenever she saw we were getting low.

The best part of my visit was our waitress, Jennifer! She was pleasant and very helpful when it came to helping us decide on what to order (I asked her what would she recommend ) everything on the menu looked so great! I got their ribs, and unlike other places, their ribs were amazing! It had that smoked flavor and didn't have a weird taste to it. Everything was cooked to perfection. I was quite nervous because it was my first time at chili's but I am sure glad I decided to give it a try.

I don't normally give 5 stars but a combination of our great waiter, much better than expected food, and decent prices left me impressed.  Ryan was a great waiter, he was polite and had a great sense of humor. Ryan interacted well with my family and sold items on the menu to us by good explanation and again, subtle humor. Overall, excellent job.  We had the loaded boneless wings....:WOW! Much better than I anticipated, very cheesy and nice flavor!  I had a humongous burger, I was ashamed after eating it all! Lol.

I really like that the silverware come in their own package. One of my biggest pet peeves is utensils on a table. I thought it was was great that this issue was avoided. Dear ordered the three appetizer and it was good. I had the chicken crisper and can't complain. Service was slow but the place was packed. Not my typical dinner venue but it was good during the middle of the week. It's also kind on my wallet. I wouldn't go here on a weekend night, too much ruckus.

The food however was horrible. My husband and I ordered the fajitas, I got shrimp and prime rib, he went with chicken and prime rib. The prime rib had the taste and texture of canned meat. The shrimp was stale, tough and tasteless.  Two hours after leaving the restaurant I was violently ill for the whole night. I'm sure that what I was experiencing was food poisoning from the shrimp.

I was looking forward to their Queso appetizer as always but it was a total miss. It was so thick and just didn't taste good. I usual love the Queso and dig in but yesterday I had two bites and was done. I was hoping for better with my boneless buffalo chicken salad which was okay for a fast food joint. My only problem was it was loaded with salad dressing. Take the healthy right out of it why don't you. We also ordered the chicken enchiladas which were loaded with salt. Not a very enjoyable meal.  I also noticed a change in the menu I guess their trying to go the healthier route. I believe that anytime any restaurant makes a change to their menu it never works out sometimes change isn't good at least for fast food.  The customer service was fine and the usual just wish they wouldn't bring your meal out 5mins after your appetizer which whatever I'm so use it to already. Paying with there small portal TV makes it for a quick in and out meal since you don't have to wait for your waiter to come back with the check and then wait for your credit card back. 1,2,3 and done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westbury?start=20

It took about 15 minutes for delivery and they forgot salad. Took another 10 minutes for salad. Southwest soup was good but only warm, must have been sitting in the back before they brought it out.

The last couple of times we were here left us very disappointed  so we took a break for a few weeks.  Being all shopped out and hungry we decided to give it one more try. McDonalds would have been a better choice. We ordered the chicken ranch sandwich and chicken crispers. The waitress was nice enough and got our orders quickly which surprised me because the bar area is usually very slow.  The food came out quick, and hot...too hot, my chicken sandwich was like a hockey puck. It was so over cooked and it tasted like old oil. You know that taste that literally leaves that greasy coating on the roof of ur mouth...yes gross. Change the oil!

Within the last few years, they've upgraded their technology. You can pay at the table, play games and even when waiting, you can get a text when your table is ready.  There are some food that are a little too salty. Like the chips with guacamole and the brocoli. I asked them not to put salt on my broccoli before, same with then chips...but i think the food is pre-packaged and all they do is put it in the microwave.  I've ordered different dishes and dont have any complaints about most dishes other than what I've mentioned.  Last night, I was there with family. We were all really pleased with our dinner. I had the combo meal. Salmon and steak made medium with loaded mash and brocoli. Cousin had the same as I, but without the salmon. My sister had the sweet and smoky burger: burger with melted pepper jack cheese, bacon, panko onion rings, lettuce, tomato, bbq sauce on the side, and onion rings.

It was way over the top. In some area's restaurants are required by law to put a the icon of a salt shaker in a triangle, if something contains more than a day's worth of sodium.

TJ H.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",0,18,5,1.0,1/3/2017,"Myself and 4 friends visited the Westbury Chili's on Monday, January 2 at 8pm in the evening. As soon as we walked in, there were some people waiting but there was no hostess. For about 4-5 minutes, we waited at the hostess area with noone around. A couple minutes later, shefinally came by and rudely said ""excuse me"" because I was leaning on the hostess area because I have torn ligaments in my foot. So I moved and I expected her to apologize for the long and unacceptable wait just to put our name in. Nope! Once we were seated, we all discussed that we wanted the guacomole so when our waiter arrived, we said asked for it and he told us that he was very busy and if we could give him a break and not order it. Never in all of my dining out have I ever heard that. I wanted to still order it but my buddies feared what might happen to our entres once we ordered them. Our waiter had the nerve to say that he could come back with the avocados and the raw materials and that WE could mix it ourselves. UNACCEPTABLE. Getting crackers for my chili and 5 waters was even met with attitude. This boggles my mind because he had time to interrupt our conversation about Universal Studios to ramble on and talk abt his vacation to Disney world to us while we payed the check.

One of the worst chain restaurants I have ever been to :( Came here for the unlimited enchiladas and had food poisoning the next day. Even though the restaurant was nearly empty at 4 pm, we were somehow put by the back corner. Our table was dirty and had left over food (including a juicebox and dirty napkins) The service was extremely slow and our waitress barely made eye contact and acted like she did not want to be there. She kept on walking pas us and not check up on us. Our water cups were empty most of the time. When it comes to the enchiladas, i have nothing good to say... The first round had maybe 1/2 meat and a little big of sauce, looked similar to the menu image and tasted 6/10  The 2nd round consists of two wraps with one tsb of meat each. By the 3rd round, we were eating just the wraps and 1 pinch of meat... and it was barely warm...

Zach H.,"Jackson Heights, NY",0,1,4,1.0,2/29/2016,"I guess I have to give Chilis one star (by default.) This being my first review I hesitantly descend down the path of food and business snobbery, and  I don't know if its even fair to begin bottom feeding on the likes of a discount chain such as Chili's, but this experience has created a need to verbify a website, and for the first time YELP.          Crowded to start, in retrospect can't even understand what the wait might be for, seeing that there is a halfway decent Cantina type spot two doors down. They tell us of a 25-35 minute wait and ask for a phone number.      Moments later we receive a text confirming we are on the list and it includes a link to download the app . It says ""Check you place in line with our APP!"" Considering we are two, and low wage hostesses are not usually the best logistical calculators, we stay after seeing 9 open tables and 2 finishing.  We also Also download the APP so we can SEE OUR PLACE IN LINE!.       Now Chilis, as a corporation does my first experience using your new ""technology"" have to be a complete sham for you to obtain contact information?  ""There are 5+ parties ahead of you"" DUH... that's why we downloaded the app to see how many there were, or is solely intended to be for people who are unable to count to 5? Worthless!           After 25 minutes we were seated, several of the previously mention available tables were still not being patronized, and for a little bit of fun we checked the app again, you know to measure your technological advances, and still there were 3 parties ahead of us at time of seating, .       Now the above was just the opening act, we came because we were hungry, had the reached the end of a strip of restaurants, and thought hey why not go here.    The first thing we got was the fried asparagus, besides the breading almost completely falling off, after a little self assembly they tasted fine. We never had it before and thought hey this is good. Then came our dishes, not only Yelp worthy, but worthy of opening a Yelp account to do so!   1. Shrimp is not white, or spongy, or under cooked, or chewier than the gum that had just been spit out. It was pink in the picture so it should have been on her plate. My GF had about three bites and was already thinking her stomach was going to hurt.   She does not eat meats besides fish and shellfish, so the thoughtful gesture of INCLUDING A CHICKEN CUBE IN HER RICE was not so well received.  2. I did not order my fajita meat, med, rare, and spoiled.  Unless that is the combo where you get different styles all on the same plate.  The beef tasted rancid, but the carnitas tasted worse. They were even more unpalatable, and gritty, and also had several different temperatures of cooking. About 3 bites total before we were on to the check.    They forgot to bring us the rice that was an upsize option for .99 with the fajitas, so the manager had to be found to take that off the check.     I understand that you are a chain,  you offer lower priced food.  But you market yourself as fresh, and it just wasn't even within an acceptable time-frame of being fresh.  I took the items to go,just  to get a second opinion, and gave the instructions ""just taste that"" and they spit it out.   The only reason i did not bring it to the attention of management because, I did not want to be punished with the potential that another option may be offered. That was the last time Chilis will be an option, and even if it was the only option I would decline. A more fitting slogan should be ""I want my moneyback, moneyback moneyback."" Because you did not serve food that was edible, and the only reason i just paid it,  was because i did not want to bring any stress to a Chili's waitress who probably had to deal with the repercussions of your poor management, and terrible products.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westbury?start=60

We had sparkling pomegranate margaritas and they were yummy. We split the skillet queso and the pretzel appetizers. The only problem was they gave us like the bottom of the bag of chips so it was like crumbs and hard to really use them for a dip,,,and the cheese that comes with the pretzels was not hot and pretty solid not creamy. But i had the margarehita flatbread pizza and mashed pot and we split a santa fe salad. Holy shit its spicy but good.

Joan R.,"Valley Stream, NY",350,360,105,4.0,8/11/2012,"Expect a wait. At least 45 minutes on a typical weekend night. Why? Because it's that good. Chili's offers some basic  building blocks for a little happiness in life. Good solid food. Reasonable prices. Friendly and accommodating staff.  A clean festive venue to socialize in. A place to get away from it all if only for a little bit. This Chile's is pretty big, bright, and lively with many colorful multi-tiled topped tables, booths, and a sizable bar. There is always a big mass of hungry people, families and young adults, waiting to get seated on a Friday and weekend nights. You can call ahead for call ahead seating, although I have not tried that. The servers were very nice and the guys were very built and pleasant to look at.  My single friend could hardly contain herself. If you join the Chili's Email Club you can get emails  with exclusive offers. I recently got an email for a free appetizer with a purchase of an entree. When you first join the email club you get a voucher for free queso and chips. The club sends a lot of different coupons over a course of time. Here's the good stuff: - Southwestern Egg Rolls $8.29 6 crispy flour tortilla filled with smoked chicken, black beans, corn, jalapeño Jack cheese, red peppers and spinach. Served with avocado-ranch dressing that had more ranch than avocado. This is absolutely delicious, rich, and flavorful. -Fire Grilled Corn Guacamole $5.29 Made with fresh avocados, cilantro, house-made pico de gallo, fire-grilled corn and jalapeños. Served with tostada chips and house-made salsa. Sweet, cool, and creamy. -Margarita Grilled Chicken $10.79 Classic Margarita-flavored grilled chicken with hints of lime and citrus, served with rice, black beans, tortilla strips and house-made pico de gallo. One of the healthier meals with only 550 calories and with good flavors. Heartening, nourishing, and tasty. -Fajita Trio Fajitas$14.89 Meaty grilled steak, tender chicken and scrumptious spicy garlic and lime shrimp with grilled onions and peppers. Served with 3 warm tortillas, house-made pico de gallo, mixed cheese and sour cream.  I would order it Cadillac style with rice and black beans for $0.99. The 3 tortillas it came with are small and may not be enough to use all the meat on the skillet. -2 for 1 beers on Friday night. We got 2 mugs of bud light for $4.

The onions and peppers were sad and limp and curiously devoid of any real flavor. The little dishes of condiments accompanying the fajitas were cute and contained some good choices, including a spicy butter and a jalapeño onion relish, which at least lent some spice and flavor to the otherwise bland food.

There are great specials that are a company thing, but almost all of our servers have been really kind. I've never received service from anyone at the restaurant that made me go ""wow"", but this place will do its job to satisfy your hunger. Sometimes my order will mess up (cook's fault, I suppose) or an item wasn't put in (and I therefore have to wait another 10-15 minutes for it), but I'm willing to put up with it as long as my family members like coming here.  Wait times can be 20-60+minutes during weekends - I usually wait 30-45. You can call ahead to put your name on the list so that the wait can be shorter for you. My deepest wish for this place is that the menu lists food allergies or contamination from shared oil or pots CLEARLY next to each food item. This is a practice that's becoming more common. While Chili's website has a list of food allergies, it is inconvenient to have to look it up each time and just takes more time to place the order. The waiters should be more trained in knowledge of what food allergies and specialty diets mean, and how to properly ask the right questions so that nobody has a breakout or a really upset stomach when arriving home (me).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westbury?start=80

Chips were extremely greasy.  Salsa was very watery and barely stayed on the chip.   Guacamole was decent. The chicken fajita was weird.  The chicken quality is not the best, and it seemed to be very skimpy with the peppers, onions, and rice.  Just seems like a poor value, and I only ate half of it because it just didn't taste that fresh... One mango iced tea was decent and not overly watered down, the other blackberry iced tea tasted funny (almost like a beer taste) and had to be replaced with another.  Aparently, it still had a mild beer taste to it.  Either it tastes like beer, or the plastic mugs they are using may be poorly washed and you may be drinking someone else's beer schwag that sat at the bottom (let's hope this isn't true). One of us ordered a grilled chicken dish and the chicken had a weird skin piece on it that even the waitress thought was strange.  They took the piece of chicken back and left the rest of the plate.  Well over 10 minutes later, the waitress came back with another piece of chicken on a small dish.  Most of us were just bout done eating by the time we got the replacement chicken piece.  They didn't even offer to take that meal off the bill.

Despite WANTING the chicken Crispers with every fiber of my being, I ordered a steak burrito (which I'm sure is not a healthy option, but compared to the chicken Crispers, it's a spa salad).  The burrito was pretty tasteless, which is surprising.  How does one fuck up a burrito?  It basically tasted like nothing and was a fairly boring eating experience until I felt a sharp pain and my mouth started bleeding.  I spit out the offending bite, and found a medially sized jagged shard of wood IN my burrito.  I mentioned it to the waitress and she apologized and removed my food.  The manager (who was appropriately contrite) came over and apologized but said ""I can't imagine what that could be bother than a chicken bone.""  When I informed her that I had ordered the steak burrito, she said it must be a piece of a wooden skewer.  She apologized and comped my disgusting burrito (although imo, she should have comped all of our food as that was substantially  large infraction.  Because we were still hungry, we did order an additional appetizer size of the chicken Crispers, but either they had changed since the last time I ordered them, or I just had horribly shitty taste as a 25 year old, because they were beyond gross and my husband and I were both doubled over in stomach pain for the entire night.  Chili's will not be a place that we go EVER again, but when we left there was a rather long line, so I am surprised that SO many people are willing to consume such shitty food on such a regular basis.  America, you confuse me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westbury?start=80

Don't remember her name. She said there were also two gentleman who would be helping out. Throughout the night not one ever came up to us to let us know they were helping out. First off the waitress had no knowledge about the beers. I asked her if she had pumpkin and she had no clue. She also told us incorrect beers that were include in the specials. I decided to just get an Iced Tea. I had a coupon for a free appetizer or dessert. We showed the waitress and ordered the Texas cheese fries as well as our entrees.  After that there was a leak starting above our table. I felt as if I was taking a shower. The hostess moved us to a different table and she was very nice. We waited a while for our food. When it finally came out, the entrees came out before the Texas fries. We weren't happy. The manager came over quickly after that with our fries. She dropped them on the table and said I'm sorry about that these are on us. She also got us refills. Well obviously the fries are on you we had a coupon so that really did nothing for us. She never told us her name of anything or ever come back to check up on us. Honestly nobody checked up on us after that for about 10 minutes to see how our food came out or if we needed anything. We had empty cups that sat on our table for most of the night. Horrible pre-busing.  The table across from us remained dirty for about 25 minutes. Not something we want to be staring at while we eat our dinner. The food was actually good though but that was defiantly the only positive. I got a to-go box for my food. Got our check then didn't see our waitress again for a while. Had to ask another gentlemen to find her for us so we can pay. He said he would take care of it for us which was the correct thing to do. We sat very close to the POS system where everyone was standing including the manager so I honestly think we should have been checked up on sooner and there should be no reason our table should be dirty. We all work at a restaurant down the street from this location. I am a manager, the other two friends I was with were a server and a cook. We were very disappointed with the service and our overall time at the restaurant. If this doesn't improve Joes Crab Shack opening next to you will steal a lot of your business. I know they will get mine as I don't plan on returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westbury?start=140

Seta M.,"Hempstead, NY",11,59,16,1.0,1/16/2012,"I will not be going back to Chili's again. My wife and I have avoided Chili's because we didn't see too much in the way of food for vegetarians. In 2012 that is actually bad business.  We received a gift card for the holidays for Chili's and on a whim we decided, hey, let's give it a chance. We ordered drinks and appetizers while we tried to scour the menu for something we could MAKE vegetarian even if they didn't have the courtesy to give us good choices. We are pretty adept at doing this (as a few places we have gone to haven't caught up with the times yet) so this was not unusual. We got our appetizers and main at the same time. Not quite what we wanted to do. What we did choose for a main took a lot of creativity and settling as even trying to find something we could switch to vegetarian took some doing.  We ordered a white zinfandel and I'm not sure what company it came from, but it did not tast good. Dessert was good however. We had a chocolate cake with 2 scoops of ice cream.  Now I probably would have given the experience 3 stars even though we did not get what we wanted, however here's what ruined my night and as days have gone by have made me angry. We had a gift card for 50.00. The bill was 42.00. Here is what the waiter did when he got the gift card. He took it and said thank you and began to walk away. We were surprised and kind of looked at him. He, acknowledging our surprise said it again and left. So we lost $8.00 on this deal. He did not offer us a credit for the difference, he did not acknowledge the difference in the bill, he just left.  Both my wife and I were annoyed by this. This is where the restaurant lost the other two stars. Chili's need to do a better job with things like this. They need to join the 2012 list of businesses like Red Robin and California Pizza kitchen that offer vegetarian alternatives and actual vegetarian meals. Their commercials make you want to go to the place. One visit.....Cured.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westbury?start=140
Geraldine S.,"New Hyde Park, NY",59,110,,3.0,1/6/2007,"If you just stick with the basics, you'll be okay. Usually, this is true but I had a tequila chicken dish that was pretty good for a chain restaurant and the my brother had some other mexican style dish and we were both pretty happy. It's a good place to go if you need food before or after a movie because you can walk to the theatre (Westbury Raceway Theatre is right there).  I liked it but the staff was a little inattentive because I was actually hoping for a refill on my coke but no such luck and we had to catch our movie so my thirst was left unquenched.  I will go back to try the ribs that everyone seems to love...except that guy Scott. I love ribs so this will be a good little test.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westbury?start=140
Ben B.,"New York, NY",0,55,,3.0,7/5/2010,For a cheap pretty good meal Chili's is a fine place to go.  The 2-for-1 margaritas are tasty although they never seem to have enough booze in them.  The biggest downside of this place is the crazy wait on a Friday or Saturday night.  At Chili's you know what you are going to get and that's why people choose it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westbury?start=140
Crystal P.,"Mineola, NY",495,720,1082,5.0,9/19/2011,okay all the whiners below my review. it's CHILI'S!! if you want some high class restaurant this is not the place for you. now I love high class expensive restaurants but if I ate there all the time we'd have no money! so for lunch some days or just one of those nights we don't want to go nuts me and my friends or me and my boyfriend go to Chilis. they have the $20 deal and the food is yummy. it's not 5 star restaurant yummy but it is yummy. anyone complaining just go somewhere else jesus. it's not the place for you. of course the food is not always amazing and sometimes I'm like what did they do? but that's anywhere you go. all places have an off night they can't be perfect and delicious every time. only complaint about Chilis is they close too early. stay open like applebees does! it sucks when we want to go out late and besides applebees all we have is diners at only 11 pm. long island isn't NYC but some places can stay open an extra hour until 1 am for those who work late and want actual food! this goes for all restaurants in the area besides applebees too. an extra hour will not kill you!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westbury?start=140

The next time I came back here I got the ribs and they were horrible!!! HOW CAN THEY NOT DO THIS RIGHT???? They have all those damn commericals and freakin' Mike Myers singing about them and they sucked!! They were dry and had very little meat on them and the sauce was like ketchup!

Another thing, the metal fork they have was so sharp, I accidentally bit on the fork with my fries on it and literally the edge of my bottom tooth was chipped. By that time, I didn't want to eat anymore... My friend had the cajun chicken pasta and I had the sante fe sizzling platter. I do not recommend the sante fe dish. It looked really tasty on the menu.

My son wasn't into his cheeseburger meal and he usually is a good eater. My friend ordered the cajun chicken pasta.
