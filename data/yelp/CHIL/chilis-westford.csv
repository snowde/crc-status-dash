Tabitha M.,"Reno, NV",79,139,306,1.0,6/22/2017,"We stopped here on a long road trip to get something quick but maybe a little better than fast food and were severely disappointed. First off, when we first walked in their was no hostess. We looked around, no waitress or bartender to be seen so we waited several minutes to be seated. This isn't that bad, but just unusual. The bathrooms were appalling, disgusting in smell and the floor was intensely slippery. There were 4 of us and the waitress completely messed up completely 2 of our orders, after we waited quite a while to get our food. So our quick stop put us at 1 hour 20 minutes. Refills were never offered on our drinks. The food was so greasy I barely ate half of what I ordered. I'm not a big Chilis fan to begin with but this location was a terrible experience for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westford
C L.,"Stow, MA",0,30,,4.0,4/27/2017,"Stopped by Saturday, April 22, 2017 for dinner @7pm.    39 minute wait that was only 10. Upbeat server, suggested the $5 margarita which was great.     Menu has many options, I enjoyed the combo platter with ribs, chicken & sausage - excellent choice.   My wife got the fajitas (beef&chicken) which was not very good      Meat was unusual flavor.   Several managers very active running food, helping were needed and keeping place running well.     If you have not tried child's lately give it chance.     We did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westford
Sue M.,"Westford, MA",0,40,2,4.0,6/26/2017,"There were three adults in our party. Service was friendly, professional, courteous, and very attentive. Tables are small considering the size of the plates. The portions are great prices are what you would expect.  Mid prices. Good food. Nice clean atmosphere. Music is just loud enough to be in the back ground.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westford
Rich Z.,"Acton, MA",35,213,73,2.0,6/5/2016,"Was just at this location this evening. Probably our 10th visit.  Each time we resolve to not go back.  Not because of the quality of food. It's good for the most part. What this location lacks is service.  Each waiter or waitress is worse than the last.  It is clear that there is no manager on duty, and the staff is lacking basic training. Solution? 1. Get the order right.  Confirm it when the order happens so there are no mistakes, no need for a re-do. 2. Check back with your customers every couple of minutes. If you can't, send the manager or the hostess. 3. If anyone asks for water, bring water for everyone. 4. If your customers have small children, bring their food first. Make it happen quickly.  Little kids get bored and restless. 5. If the place is super busy, call in your best people and make a fortune.   Chili's, get new management and staff for this location pronto.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westford
Snady G.,"Maynard, MA",0,3,,1.0,2/1/2017,"We were regular patrons in the past but lately their service has been extremely slow and inexcusable.  The appetizer was cold by the time it easy served, and that took 20 minutes.  We had to ask for the salad that came with the 3/ $10meal. We had to ask for refills on drinks. The table across from us had an even longer wait, they finally asked for chips. They never came, but 5 minutes later their food arrived. We've been here 45 minutes and are still waiting for our food. This is not the first time we've experienced this situation. Survey says: I  won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westford
Richard B.,"Apex, NC",0,9,3,1.0,10/2/2014,"Arrived at 10:30, well before the 11 PM closing time, but was treated as if I was inconveniencing them. I should have listened to the other reviews about the attitude. Maybe my food will be good, but I'll definitely need the dirty silverware replaced first. Ugh! Update: Fajita's were ok but they forgot my fries. I dare not ask for them for fear of the ""kitchen closed"" wrath. What happened to the Chili's I used to love????? :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westford
Linda E.,"Greenville, NH",0,3,,4.0,2/25/2017,"We had a great dinner tonight at Chili's.  We were seated promptly, served promptly and the food was excellent.  We had the best waitress ever!  They told us she's new, but anyway Shane, you added to the enjoyment of our dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westford
T B.,"Marlborough, MA",0,18,,1.0,6/14/2015,"The whole Chili's chain has gone down hill ever since they removed the grills and replaced them with infrared conveyor belts. They call this the kitchen of the future. This is supposed to speed up the orders. They are trying to make their food like McDonald's so anyone without cooking skills can cook in their kitchen. The chicken and shrimp come out like they have been boiled and not grilled like the advertise in their menus. All of the pictures on the menus and TV commercials show grill marks as if the food is grilled. This is false advertising and Chili's should remove the word grill from their name and stop calling their food grilled. They call the chicken grilled in several dishes. Today we had chicken fajitas and this is the last time we will be eating anything at Chili's. The fajitas at Chili's used to be the best and now they are the worst. Next thing will be salsa from a can and chips from a bag. It's coming. Anything to cut costs and lower quality. Now with the tablets at the tables they want to eliminate the interaction with the servers.  After 20 loyal years going to Chili's having fajitas weekly, we are done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westford
Brendan K.,"Westford, MA",70,2,,1.0,3/10/2016,"Called To Go and ordered a burger and chicken fingers at 619. They told me come by in 20. So I came by at 640 and waited until 720 to finally get my raw burger and the worst chicken fingers I have ever seen. They didn't have any more breaded chicken, so they fried the chicken and it wasn't even halfway cooked. Now my girlfriend is missing class because she's suffering from food poisoning from one bite of this ""meat"". This is a terrible excuse for a restaurant and I would advise anyone and everyone to stay away from here for safetys sake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westford
Matt W.,"Westford, MA",0,24,,2.0,10/2/2015,"I love the food at the Chili's chain. But the Westford location is so incredibly disappointing. I went in around 7pm on a weeknight. The place was 2/3 empty, but for some reason I had to wait about 5 minutes for a table. I thought the hostess was pulling my leg at first. I didn't see a lot of my waiter, even though, again, the place was about 2/3 empty. I ordered a burger, which took at least 20 minutes. I wasn't in any hurry, but it seemed odd. The table next to me was a family of 4, and they had ordered before I walked in. A bit after my food arrived, they complained that they still hadn't received their food. I heard the waiter explain that their pasta sometimes takes 13 minutes to prepare, even though they'd definitely been waiting twice that time. The burger was so-so. Not bad, but nothing to write home about. All around, this was a disappointing visit and I don't think I'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westford
Cassandra Q.,"Boxford, MA",0,6,,2.0,8/31/2016,"I don't really know why we keep coming here. The last time we waited 5 minutes for someone to wander to the host stand to be seated, another 10 minutes for the server to greet our table. We told her we were on a time crunch. We waited 25 minutes for our food. I thought Chilis was supposed to be quick especially because I ordered a quesadilla and my hubby got a med rare steak (which came out well done).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westford
Kathy M.,"Lexington, MA",0,10,,1.0,9/8/2014,Worst sandwich I've ever been served.  I have ago to Chilis sandwich that I always get and at any other location have loved it.  At this location I could not eat it!  I had to ask if there was someone to wait on me and I was one of two customers on the bar.  Even if you are a chili's fan I'd pass up this location.  If I could give zero stars or better yet negative I would!

Carlos A.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",9,12,,2.0,5/7/2015,"Amy at the bar was great.  However, the food was horrible.  I ordered the new Ranchero Chicken Tacos.  They appeared to be thrown together.  No presentation to be seen.  The contents of the tacos were skimpy, and they were served cold.  IN addition, I would have imagined that the chicken would have been shredded after having been sauteed in some sauce.  NOPE.  The chicken was grilled, and apparently microwaved, so it was rock hard.  Not recommended for food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westford
Jaysun L.,"Waltham, MA",19,15,2,2.0,10/17/2014,"Horrible service. Waited 15 minutes for the server to even come over to us. There was another table that just up and left because they didn't want to wait. I see their staff slowly rolling in through the door, it's 12:08 on a Friday... why is half the staff coming in after the start of prime lunch time. Food is okay, I normally get the Flatbread pizza, normally service is a lot better but this is horrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westford
Wayne L.,"Nashua, NH",17,94,3,3.0,7/13/2013,Chili's has had a formula of reasonable place for a reasonable price for years and it works for them. As long as you know what you are to expect you are going to enjoy yourself.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westford
Ted S.,"Ayer, MA",0,2,,1.0,10/31/2014,"Terrible. They now have tablets on each table that the kids just need to play with a fight over. Obviously, whoever came up with this bright idea has no kids.

Elle G.,"Toronto, Canada",25,296,42,1.0,4/23/2012,"This Chili's is totally missable. I don't know what happened to Chili's - it used to be good. This one is definitely missable. Why? How about? --- - wait forever to make my order - waiter brings my drink, but forgets water and cultery - wait forever and never see the guy - brings the food and I have to remind him I have no cultery and no water - run out of my drink -- and would probably have had another but alas the waiter is no where to be found - the food is messy -- one napkin -- you get the picture -- and no waiter, etc to get another one or two! - the restaurant was not busy but staff was busy chatting each other up instead of making sure clients were satisfied - finally was able to get the bill - waited a long time for someone to pick up the credit card - finally got the manager's attention and he did it and asked me if everything was ok - uh NO!!! - Was totally ridiculous -- he was as bad as the rest - chatting up the hostess - I mean people - get it together - the food was ok -- the service was brutal - I won't be back and won't recommend to others  Get with it folks.

Brit L.,"Littleton, MA",0,16,17,1.0,11/2/2013,"Food was ok nothing special. I'm not a huge fan of any of the chains in the area, but had a gift card. I think I had the worst waitress ever. She simply just disappeared, and basically just dodged our table, which only consisted of myself and 14 year old niece, ordering simple meals and waters. Basically had to jump out from our table to get her attention, just for our check. I felt like I aged a couple years waiting for some sort of service. Honestly we could have been served and brought our check, left a nice tip, and been on our way. I don't think I have ever left less than a 25% tip, up until tonight.

Andrew F.,"Westford, MA",11,35,20,3.0,6/13/2013,"After attempting to take my mom to her first Bruins game, the game was cancelled, so we just decided to crash here since it was close to home. I was never a big Chili's fan so I didn't expect much. This place was just a little bit better than I expected. We got a pretzel stick appetizer and that we actually pretty good. I got the Crispy Chicken Crisper's and they were well cooked and well seasoned, but I have had better. My mom got a burger and found it to be standard Chili's quality. The fries were good as well. Dessert was tasty as well. On a normal Chili's visit, it probably would have been so average that I wouldn't post a review, but I decided to make a exception for this time. Good place to go when your craving a decent burger and beer, as well as other grilled or fried food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westford?start=20

My sister and I had a really good leisurely lunch here yesterday. She ordered the chicken Caesar salad (was huge and she ended up taking home much of the chicken), and I had the sliced sirloin, with sautéed mushrooms, caramelized onions,  and arugula on warm flatbread. Both of our orders hit the spot. The waitress was very friendly and made sure to refill the water and iced tea. My sister and I spent a couple of hours here and no one pressed us to leave or handed us the check so we'd feel rushed.

Diane W.,"Westford, MA",3,16,1,1.0,7/24/2008,"While waiting for a takeout order, you get a good view of the kitchen staging counter. This is the area where orders are passed from the kitchen to waitstaff and others who put the last touches on the plates and make sure the orders are complete before heading out. At one point, someone who appreared to be a manager or shift leader reached over the counter area. Did he get on his tip toes and reach? No. Did he call over for someone closer to get whatever it was he was reaching for? No. He used the handle end of broom!!!
