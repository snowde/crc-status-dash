Shelbie A.,"Lynnwood, WA",92,25,58,5.0,3/28/2016,Our food was amazing as always. Fast and friendly service that we can always count on. We had a wonderful lunch this afternoon thanks to the wonderful staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wichita-falls
Robert P.,"Baltimore, MD",1,54,39,3.0,4/22/2017,"Service was good, queso and chips good, Presidente Margarita good. Fried Pickles, bad.  I don't recommend them here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wichita-falls
Lin G.,"Boston, MA",1003,771,10,3.0,7/9/2016,"2.5 stars Our first impulse when picking out where to eat is not to pick a chain restaurant, like Chili's.  But in a place like Wichita Falls, you are often left without much in terms of choices outside of chain restaurant.  Now that that's out of the way, I've eaten here twice in the past year.  The most recent time was last night where I got the full rack of ribs.  Usually in my weak old age, a full rack of ribs is more than enough to keep me satisfied but for some reason last night, I didn't feel satisfied.  Maybe it's because my friend ordered a ribeye steak and it came out like, the size of a chicken egg.  I felt bad for her so I gave her two ribs.  Why is a ribeye steak the size of an egg??  In any world?   The service was serviceable and like the ac was on so strong that I was freezing and found it hard to stick around and talk after the food was finished.  Maybe that's their goal.  They do have those nifty little pay screen machines at every table so you hardly have to interact with waitstaff at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wichita-falls
Kat W.,"Burkburnett, TX",2,121,18,3.0,1/19/2017,"Service is lacking, typical chain bland choices. But hey, their fried asparagus is good?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wichita-falls
Krystle H.,"Wichita Falls, TX",25,50,14,5.0,8/30/2015,"Service was on point, food was great, and no one apologized for ignoring me. I updated my review from 3 stars to 5 stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wichita-falls
Alysha K.,"Dallas, TX",6,62,17,2.0,1/17/2016,"What terrible service. My family and I (party of 3) were seated and not waited on until I finally got up and asked someone to help us. From there, it took me talking to a manager for us to get our appetizer which was only cheese fries. Our food was adequate. The asparagus was covered in salt. Like ridiculously covered, it was disgusting. We had to ask for another side because the one we had was gross. Our side of Mac and cheese never came out until we finally asked for it. We weren't the only ones who had bad service though, the poor old couple beside us had to get us and refill their own drinks. I felt bad for them. The food was ok, as prices are low but the service was absolutely terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wichita-falls
Kerry O.,"Frisco, TX",158,395,155,4.0,8/26/2015,Move in day at MWSU and needed a break.  This Chili's is just around the corner and we found the service and food to be great.  Had the weekday lunch special - double patty hamburger with iced tea; did I mention it was 96 outside and the air wasn't working in the on-campus apartment?  Anyways; it was very cool in the bar area where they assured us we could cool down and the food was excellent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wichita-falls
Andrey S.,"Derwood, MD",25,34,35,5.0,12/14/2015,"It's rare that I give a place a five, especially a chain restaurant. I have the lunch tacos, they were very yummy. And puts chilies at a 4 what bumped this place up was my server. Wow, he was great! He just keeper bringing me refills on my drink and checking in on me at just the right time. Was just as friendly and kind to the other tables.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wichita-falls
Maygen L.,"Wichita Falls, TX",49,22,23,5.0,9/28/2015,"As this is a large chain everyone knows what Chili's has to offer, I think the new tablet deals on the table are awesome and I think our local chili's has amazing service and the food is always consistent, it's one of my favorite run to restaurants.  It's a great place to go on a budget and when you need to eat and get back to business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wichita-falls
Keisha P.,"Dayton, OH",0,32,20,3.0,4/12/2015,Average. Good restaurant with more choices than I expected. Food was a bit salty. Service was slow and the waitress wasn't very on the ball.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wichita-falls
Lily B.,"Wichita Falls, TX",1,26,48,2.0,2/6/2014,Walked in and there was no one to greet or seat me AGAIN. Saw three customers. Waited for a fair amount of time and decided to leave. I'll be passing on this Chili's and going to Cheddar's instead.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wichita-falls
Larry S.,"Burkburnett, TX",3,18,1,3.0,11/27/2012,Went today and the wife and I got the 2 for 20 deal. Food was good and service fair. Only one observation ... our server was cleaning a table and dropped the cloth she was cleaning with on to the filthy floor. She picked up the cloth and continued cleaning the table with that same cloth as if nothing had happened.  YUCK!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wichita-falls
Duane M.,"Littleton, CO",51,269,8,4.0,12/9/2012,"Ya know - a Chili's is a Chili's.  You know what to expect from this chain restaurant.  We stopped here on the way to Houston from Denver and watched a little football and did the 2 for 20 deal.  The GF had the honey-chipolte chicken crispers and I had the fried shrimp.  Cold beer, college football, attentive bartender and friendly patrons made it a fun evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wichita-falls
Tiffany S.,"Lewisville, TX",72,6,2,3.0,10/14/2013,"Tasted like normal Chili's food. Both my husband and I got the triple dipper. Food was hot and quick. The table drove me crazy rocking back and forth. The waitress kept coming by asking if we needed anything and threw (almost literally) refill drinks on the table without even having to ask. The service was well methodical not really friendly, but then who can complain with actually getting service from a waitress instead of having to chase her down? Some updating and cleaning would hurt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wichita-falls
