Kris D.,"Virginia Beach, VA",193,208,169,4.0,10/9/2017,"I have not been to Chili's for some time, and I had forgotten how good their food is!   Say at the bar on a football weekend and really had a relaxing time.   We had a guacamole/Chips appetizer, and also ordered some chicken and steak fajitas.   Wonderful!   Server at the bar was great! One thing I did notice though...  guacamole and chips calorie count was listed on the menu.   1480 calories!   Holy crap, and all these years I thought guacamole was healthy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williston
Dave J.,"Colchester, VT",0,14,1,2.0,9/17/2017,"So, I suppose they're trying to save some money these days.  They removed a bunch of things off the menu, but did so BEFORE replacing the menus. That was tough when multiple things I tried to order no longer exist.  I said I'll take the cheese enchiladas. I was informed they no longer have red sauce for them. Ok? That's like still keeping pizza on your menu but doing away with the cheese. What's the point? Tonight was my first bad experience. There are too many good local restaurants around here to be wasting my time there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williston
Megan B.,"Burlington, VT",0,33,4,1.0,1/13/2018,"I hadn't come here in years, but came last night on a whim. I remember feeling unwanted the last time, and it was no different now....years later.

Sheb J.,"Essex Junction, VT",3,14,6,4.0,12/5/2017,"The whole office ordered lunch today. I tried the honey chipotle chicken crisper and waffles. I didnt expect much, just didn't feel like a burger. I was pleasantly surprised. It's a different take on chicken and waffles for sure, but if you like sweet and spicy its worth a try.   Everyone in the office was happy with their food. No mistakes. Ready when they said.  Thank you for a good lunch!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williston
Ryan S.,"North Raleigh, Raleigh, NC",16,8,,2.0,9/26/2017,"Ordered the fajitas takeout after a late night flight into town. They came out 15 minutes later than what the website said and the restaurant was not busy. They put the cheese, tomatoes, guac and sour cream in the same Styrofoam container and when i went to eat it it was all jumbled together and inedible. I dont like sc or guac. Steak for fajitas was tough and full of sinew, can't even chew it,  its so stringy. Chicken was okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williston

Louise C.,"Albany, VT",38,76,59,2.0,3/5/2017,"Not happy this time! We didn't get plates w. our appetizers. Drinks sat empty too long. Ordered a fajita without peppers, had to send it back. IN the meantime the sides got cold. A mgr brought the fajita mix back. Then I had to wait for our server to come so I could send the sides back because they were cold..waiting for the sides, the fahita mix got cold. The wraps were stuck together, falling apart, and cold by now. Ate it anyway..My friends steak arrived cold and the broccoli. I didn't get any plates w. the fajita. Server was MIA. Asked for a to go box, got a small one. By this time I was done! paid for our bill and left. Our table was never pre bussed. Our plates just sat there. Our server could of picked up the dirty plates, she always seemed to leave empty handed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williston

Amy S.,"Raynham, MA",15,14,,3.0,11/21/2016,"Ordered take out tonight. Visiting the area for work. Husband picked it up.  I ordered three different enchiladas, all tasted pretty much the same very salty and very little inside. I splurged for blackberry iced tea, they gave me a large plastic cup with only a tea bag in it, not even flavored tea bag. I found it quite funny, what was I supposed to do with this? But also miffed that I paid 3.29 ($4 including tip and tax) for a tea bag!  Give me a break. Wasn't a large or complex order. On plus side my husband loved the corn on the cob.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williston

Matthew E.,"Proctor, VT",0,2,,3.0,8/6/2017,"The food here was amazing.  As was the service.  There was a wide variety if things on tv to keep us occupied for the short wait for our order.  The only draw back which became increasing annoying was the Ziosks that offer games, also have sound on them and the child behind us was playing some war game and the noise was annoying and really made things unenjoyable over all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williston
Joanne T.,"Honolulu, HI",192,36,82,3.0,1/21/2015,"Okay I see why this place has such a rating. Food is like any other Chili's but is lacking in worker expertise, and at times also lacking ingredients for some dishes that some people want to order.  One of the lazier Chili's I've been to but I don't really care, I just like the food. Ribs forever!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williston

Jessica J.,"Colchester, VT",49,50,11,5.0,1/9/2016,Great food. Great drinks. Great service. Ever since they updated their menu they have so many options and it's all delicious. The service we've had every time we come here is excellent!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williston
Danny O.,"Williston, VT",11,22,,1.0,8/24/2015,"All you can eat fajitas, customer service excluded! We were told to stand and wait 15 minutes because if they seated us it would back the kitchen up. So we waited, all 8 of us. We got entrees and 3 of them were wrong. Came back with right stuff and my fajita has been done (ate) for about 15 min. Now we have not seen our waitress since drinks dropped off 10 min. ago. 20 more minutes went by and got another helping, now 15 minutes after finishing that one still waiting. Total time in chili's 2 hours at this point. I always respect the fact that they may be busy and that takes awhile but this place is half full. This was 8 months ago but never posted for some reason.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williston
Alia L.,"Jericho, VT",0,10,,2.0,11/14/2015,"Food - 3 stars  Service - 1 star  Lets start with the service. Once we were seated, it took a couple of minutes before our server approached the table. When he got there, his presence seemed like he was annoyed. Nevermind that, my friend and I proceeded to order our food and thats when everything got sour. He started asking these weird questions and making my friend uncomfortable, ok... What really got me irritated was the fact he practically threw the utensils and straw at me while my friend got the normal server to customer treatment. Now this is where it all goes downhill... Throughout the course of the meal, he was nowhere to be seen, and when he passed by to check up on us and made a few conversations here and there, he was only talking to my friend. I waited for them to finish so I could ask for another water and gave me the dirtiest look. And when we were ready for the check, that's when he ATTEMPTED to be nice to me. I did not have any of it. If you were rude to your customer from the first moment you approached their table, DO NOT expect a great tip. If you expect me to believe your ""Bear with me, it's been hectic tonight"" story. Save it. I had enough of your little stories because you were being completely friendly to my friend meanwhile I got the worst service ever.  Now onto food: food was your everyday Tex-Mex food. I must say, the burger I had was really good! The fried pickles were a debbie-downer for me. When I reached for one of them to dip in the ranch, the fried batter layer completely fell off!  I would NEVER come back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williston
brad l.,"Colchester, VT",3,127,2,4.0,9/18/2015,Enjoyed the renovation on the inside and the larger menu that has new offerings but also the classic Chili's options. Service was attentive and friendly and they had no problem giving us plenty of chips and salsa to go. Great place for the family to visit because they have something for everyone,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williston
CJ G.,"Grand Isle, VT",131,289,1,4.0,1/10/2014,"So over the past few months I have found my self coming here more often. It really is a great stop for a simple dinner or lunch. The staff is responsive to your needs and the food always comes out nice and hot. As far as the food goes we tend to like their egg rolls for an app! They serve them with a ranch dressing. Thinking about them just makes me hungry! For dinner we have had taco's, salads and even the chicken fajitas! Everything has come out great. As you may read in other reviews they menu has changed. Over all I think it has changed in a positive way. They offer something for everyone! The staff here has been pretty good as well. A bit slow and loud at times but I expect that at any restaurant. If you need a drink, they are there! If you need your check, they are there! So really what more can you ask for? Over all Chili's gets a thumbs up by me! Its one of the better chains in the Williston area. Waits are short and the food is good. If you want something that your familiar with then Chili's might be for you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williston
Jennifer F.,"Essex Junction, VT",24,19,10,1.0,12/20/2014,"After a long day of shopping we visited Chili's for a quick meal with my husband and 8 year old son.  We were seated right away at what we were told was a ""large"" table-- it was standard.  In fact, the table was squashed against another two in both directions which made it uncomfortable. The waiter was a young man; chipper and polite.  Didn't have much to say at all-- I wanted to chalk it up to them being busy, but had a hard time doing so when I saw staff and what appeared to be a shift manager talking near the computer by the restrooms about ""cute boys"". We were specific about wanting more ranch dressing with our app and salads and had to ask twice for more; not to mention we had no silverware to start and had to ask for that. The meals were correct; however my husband's fajitas came out with no tortillas and we had to ask for them.  My son also didn't have his corn and we had to ask for that.  Five to ten later their meals were complete.  Mine was cold by then, as I politely wait until everyone can eat.  No apologies or anything from the staff. The bill came and we were nickel and dimed on using their ""table entertainment"" as well as the beef choice for the fajitas.   No tip and I have only done that once.  They are terrible and a disgrace to the chain.  Surprising considering the typical level of service in restaurants in Vermont.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williston
Buck C.,"South Burlington, VT",6,65,,4.0,11/14/2014,"I decided to edit my review based on a recent visit to the restaurant. I had previously sworn that my previous visit there (about 6 months ago) would be my last. A friend of mine convinced me to give it another try, as she mentioned that the food preparation had definitely improved. Knowing that many of these chains have a revolving door of employees, I thought, why not?  I have to say that the food quality has certainly gone up a notch. My salad looked like a piece of art (yes, at Chili's...if you can believe that!) and my burger was delicious and looked like one you see on a TV ad. Not the heaping mess that they typically toss on the plate and serve. I commented to the waitress and she said it was because an Asian lady (I think the name was Anya?) prepared my food. She said her customers are always impressed when that lady is cooking. I certainly was. A pleasant, unexpected surprise.  So bottom line is that I'm giving a couple more stars because I guess it depends on who is preparing your food. Not sure what to expect upon my next visit but I'll definitely ask if the Asian lady is cooking! Also, the waitress was very nice as well and I hope she's on duty next time I return. I've gone from a nay to a yay...for now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williston?start=20
Nick P.,"Plattsburgh, NY",14,4,,2.0,2/15/2015,"Went here after a long day visiting Vermont from NY.  We walked in, and we're told there was a wait, unless we wanted to sit on he bar side.  Not a problem, when we said we were willing to wait because we didn't want to sit by the door on this day when it was negative temperatures.  Once we said that the host immediately got defensive and rude.  Apparently it was stopping him from walking around like he was big man on campus. The food was mediocre, the fries were ice cold.  our waiter, Jordan, mixed our plates up but other then that  he was an awesome server...he was a little sarcastic and while it was funny at first, it started to grow old quick.  Will we come back again, who knows, prolly not.  With all the other options in the area, I'll go somewhere where my business is appreciated by the entire staff",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williston?start=20

Esha W.,"St. Albans, VT",17,9,4,3.0,10/19/2014,"Service was okay as was the food...beer was a bit flat but I guess that's what you get for ordering a draft on special.

Karen O.,"Shelburne, VT",5,9,,2.0,11/11/2012,"The food MIGHT be good; I dunno, I never got to order. I arrived shortly after the place opened, around 11:20-11:25. I don't eat at Chili's much, but I had a coupon I wanted to use.  The girl who sat me had never hosted before, so she asked me to bear with her while she got things sorted out. For the record, she did fine. BY 11:50, I had been brought a soda but my server still had not come back to take my order. In the meantime, the table across from me (sat AFTER me) had just received their appetizer. I really did want to have lunch there, and I think 'well, I'll hang out 10 more minutes before I leave. She has to come back by then'. Nope. At noon, I promptly stood up, went to the front counter, and said I was going to pay for my soda. The young man there (sadly I missed his name) apologized for my inconvenience; at the time the shift manager came up and was filled in on what happened. They were both apologetic and offered to comp me anything on the menu, but I chose to decline. I did greatly appreciate their gesture, but by then to me the point was moot. In fact, it is only because of their stellar reaction that I am giving one star higher than I really want: I wish I had caught their names, because I want to applaud them for how they handled it with me. I'm not saying that I will never go back here, nor am I telling anyone else not to go. I think you should be aware that if ""Shelby"" is your server, you should ask to be re-sat, or else you might not get fed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williston?start=20
Hans A.,"Essex Junction, VT",0,3,,4.0,11/17/2012,"We've visited this Chili's a number of times and have experienced your typical meal and service for a chain/quick turnover restaurant.  Last evening 11/16/12 we got a glimpse of how good this restaurant can be.   The manager was on the floor, working with the hostesses, the waitstaff and I'm sure in the kitchen... obviously keeping on top of everything.  We were seated quickly and greeted warmly.  I had to take a call that put me in the takeout area where I was able to observe a clean and efficient kitchen, working the Friday night rush with good communication and quick turnaround times... no food waiting to be picked up.   Back at the table, my son's burger was cooked to the right temp, my Memphis ribs and grilled shrimp were excellent and my wife's chicken quesadilla was ""delish""!  Sides were also good.  Just a couple of mild hiccups on the service but nothing that I'd complain about. As this style of restaurant chain goes, I'd rank the chain of Chili's at the top and this location at the top of their locations.  Definitely the place to stop when shopping in the area for a quick tasty meal, drinks and sports (in the bar). 5 stars are saved for the outstanding... this last visit was 4+!

Morgan L.,"Underhill, VT",64,195,29,3.0,1/17/2012,"Eh.   Ended up here yesterday afternoon.  I used to looooove Chili's.  Used to.  Now, not so much.  They did away with the shanghai chicken wings a couple of years ago and my husband is still crying about it.  The rest of the apps taste very ho-hum.  I got a standard traditional margarita which used to be served in a 12 oz. beer stein... they have recently reduced it to a baby-sized glass!  I was a little surprised by that move. I always try to sit in the bar because I like the atmosphere more and there is far less wait for a table.  Service was on par, that's good.   But honestly...  if I am going to eat a weeks worth of calories in one sitting, I'd rather go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williston?start=20
A. Z.,"Montpelier, VT",2,120,,3.0,5/8/2011,"Meh. I really don't care for the team-styler server thing that they do. Each server has a partner for their shift, so you have not one, but *two* people checking in on your table throughout your meal. First of all, this terrifies me. What the heck do they think is going to go wrong so that I need two servers? Are the servers so unreliable that I won't be able to flag mine down if I need him/her?  All in all, I think that Chili's is better than Applebee's . . . but still not my first choice. The food is typical chain restaurant.
