Lawrence B.,"Tulsa, OK",1,10,,3.0,1/9/2018,"Kayla took very good care of me at the bar. I ordered a guacamole burger with the black bean Patty and no provolone, garlic asparagus and tomatoes, and fries.  The burger was very tasty but it fell apart. The peppers should be chopped up. The bun is airy and not dense. So it was difficult to eat, i had to finish it off with a fork.  The asparagus was really good with the tomatoes, however by itself it was bitter.  The fries were disappointing. Dry...  Next time i will ask for the black bean burger on a salad. Update: so sad that they dropped Lagunitas IPA",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon
Maren A.,"Yukon, OK",5,63,96,1.0,9/1/2017,"Bleh. We ONLY chose to eat here because we had gift cards from years ago we finally decided to just go and use. We were greeted and seated quickly and our waitress was right there to take our drink order. Because we had $50 to spend from a gift card and didn't want money left over on the card, we ordered the skillet queso appetizer. Omg. This stuff was seasoned goop. There was zero cheese flavor and the consistency and color indicated there probably wasn't any cheese in it. It is said to have ""beef"" in it, but I almost thought the chunks in the queso was TVP. It was spongey and in no way actual, real meat. The amount of tortilla chips this place throws away is probably astronomical. Many tables around us, us included, had a full basket left over, and had been eating on it the whole meal. Salsa was tomato-water. Thin with no discernible salsa vegetables, almost like they dilute the leftover juices and re-serve.  I haven't been to a Chilis since I was in high school, probably ~8-10 years, so I ordered what I remembered: the chicken crispers. Surprisingly, these were actually pretty crispy. The quality of the chicken was questionable, though. Thin, dried out, stringy pieces. My bf had the bacon burger, which didn't have any bacon on it and the patty was as dry as old shoe leather. The only positive note: the steamed broccoli was actually GREAT. Perfectly cooked and seasoned!  Now that our gift card is gone, I have a little more room in the pockets of my wallet and another Yukon chain restaurant I will NEVER return to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon
Glendena R.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,4,,1.0,1/7/2018,"The young ladies, hostesses, seemed to be bothered that customers are there. They were more into their conversation with each other. Our service was extremely slow. Not thinking my family and I will be returning anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon
Robbie C.,"Chanute, KS",51,7,16,3.0,8/12/2017,"Stopped in with friends for a ""brunch"" ""lupper"" or ""linner."" Service was very good today. Contrary to what I've read prior to coming. Had the fajitas with beef and shrimp. Added queso and pico... I'll be ordering that again. Might be a little elevated on the price when you have grown-up drinks with your meal. But all and all not bad food or service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon
Joann R.,"Yukon, OK",3,6,1,1.0,7/11/2017,"Absolutely disgusted. Had take out. Will be returning to get money back. Kids pizza had no cheese and burned. Food was cold and tasted like it had been sitting for days. Will not be returning, well only to ask for refund. I miss my Chili's in Moore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon
Haley Marlene B.,"Del City, OK",117,13,,2.0,9/28/2017,"I've tried this chili's numerous times. I love chili's normally but this one isn't worth it. The wait staff is awfully hateful most of the time. The bartender was nice, though. I'd rather drive to another location if I'm craving chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon
Tony R.,"Mustang, OK",22,38,67,2.0,10/16/2016,I thought Fajitas were supposed to come out hot. and sizzling! These were served lukewarm and they only give you 2 tortillas which were rolled up in foil and stuck together so you can't pull them apart so actually you get 1 thick tortilla. The service was good. Drinks and the appetizer were brought promptly. There's to many other places to eat in this area for me to go back here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon
Kristi S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",16,18,5,5.0,6/24/2017,Kayla's great and totally knows how to read a table! Happy they have Lagunitas IPA on tap,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon
Teresa L.,"Sweetwater, OK",1,38,3,2.0,8/12/2017,"Lunch today at Chilis. Ehh. The Waitresses did not have name badges on so I don't know who ours was. She was very inattentive and slow! We ordered drinks and they weren't out when she came by to see if we wanted appetizers.  The waffle crisper appetizer was really good. I asked for pepper jack cheese on my big mouth burgers and they came with American. I only ate 2 of the 4. My husband had fajitas which were not sizzling or hot and didn't have enough tortillas. When she came back by (once) she said how's everything tasting and before I could tell her the cheese was wrong she was gone, didn't even really slow down for an answer. This is the second Chilis we've eaten at that wasn't up to par, probably won't eat here anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon
John H.,"Muncie, IN",0,10,3,2.0,10/18/2016,"The food was so so I didn't finish my steak if that tells you anything. The worst part of eating there was the constant reminder by the manager that they close at 10:30. I got there about 9:45 and by 10 he was telling everyone who came in that they were closing at 10:30 to the point that it was super annoying.  It's simple in my humble opinion, if you have a customer show up before closing, you seat them and serve them. Don't let the first thing you say to them be we close at 10:30.  He locked the doors at 10:25 to boot.  The waiter did a decent job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon
Rick T.,"Yukon, OK",30,8,11,2.0,3/4/2017,Service not so great several things not in stock to make. Not one of the better ones of these I have eaten at,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon
Ronny A.,"Sparta, WI",40,13,41,3.0,7/10/2016,This place around 8pm was a little under staffed. Our server was pretty good. The hostess was not really a people person. When ask a couple of question he just walked away. Overall i would come here again just because the food outweighs there restaurant's downfalls.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon
Dane M.,"Yukon, OK",0,27,1,1.0,7/25/2017,"Worst chilis I have ever eaten at. We have eaten in the restaurant and takeout both, neither is satisfactory. Either way the food was cold and incorrect, so I would recommend you eat there so you can get your order corrected after they mess it up or check your takeout order carefully before leaving so corrections can be made, because you will NOT be able to trust that your order is correct.  For example I ordered a smokehouse burger, which was missing bacon and the BBQ sauce and was cold as well?! Anyway if you really like chilis go to the one in Oklahoma City or go somewhere else in Yukon to spend your hard earned money, because more than likely you will leave here unsatisfied and aggravated. Good luck!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon
Joe C.,"Yukon, OK",0,8,,3.0,11/22/2016,"We had burger and tex fries, good! Also ribs, not that good overcooked and not enough sauce. Very over priced!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon
Kris A.,"Duncan, OK",16,111,49,4.0,1/15/2016,Chili's is consistent. Food has always been good and fresh.  Usually have something on the menu for everyone. Ribs are pretty good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon
Jennifer A.,"Yukon, OK",42,3,,1.0,9/6/2016,"We never get To go out eat with three little ones, take out for us is a luxury. We get home ready enjoy our food to find in my husbands food long strains of black hair all in his food! We call they say that they are to busy for him to speak to the manager, take his number said one will call back. That never happened and next day he calls back up there and again said matter would be handled and will call back never happened!! We will never be eating at this location again down right nasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon
Doug J.,"Oklahoma City, OK",29,4,1,1.0,4/4/2016,"One star is to good for this joint. Under staffed, dirty,slow service,served the wrong food. Weak drinks. The manager told me it was a smooth evening. I won't be back. Managements standards are too low.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon
Lisa B.,"Gainesville, TX",1,8,,2.0,1/24/2016,"So disappointed. Ordered the sirloin steak with French fries & asparagus. Steak was ok, ff's were not even lukewarm. Asparagus was not warm. I guess everyone wants ""fresh"" vegetables but at least warm them up. I'm so done eating at this chain. 2 stars because waitress was really nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon
Michael S.,"Mustang, OK",9,2,,1.0,8/9/2015,Me and my girlfriend and our kids eat Chili's alot and everytime we eat here in Yukon there is always something wrong. One day this guy Curtis gave us horrible service and after we left  we called the manager lady and she seemed to not care so the next time we went back we walked in the door and he told the hostess once he saw us that he didn't want us and then starred at us the hole time we were there. We only had two waiters in 2 years that has actually did the job and made sure everything was right and his name is blake and the other guy colors his hair. Them 2 are the best. The food is never right and we always have to send it back. Eat at chilis at your own risk,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon
Paula S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,4,3,1.0,3/3/2016,Had dinner here tonight and would not recommend this place to anyone. We waited an hour for our food and when it came my chicken wasn't even cooked all the way. Our waiter was great felt bad for him but this place has always had poor food and it just get worse every time I go.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon
Jason B.,"Oklahoma City, OK",56,310,13,3.0,7/9/2015,Chili's is not what it once was when I was a kid. They change up their menu too often. The burgers are still good. The ribs are no where near what they could be. The fajitas are good but they have taken away some of the better choices for fajitas like the chicken bacon mushroom or the buffalo chicken fajitas. Average food from an average restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon?start=20
Lara M.,"Tulsa, OK",15,29,38,1.0,7/11/2015,I don't know what has happened at this restaurant but OMG it is so bad!!! I gave this crap hole two chances before I posted this review!! It is the worst food. I had the black bean burger that was like cardboard!! I have been to other chillies and loved it. I do not recommend you go to the Yukon OK location at lol. The staff there is so rude that alone will make a person never want to go back!! I emailed the manager and never heard back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon?start=20
Allen C.,"Fremont, CA",107,414,3998,4.0,4/4/2013,Came here for lunch.  The servers were very nice and the margarita chicken was tasty as always.  Overall everyone enjoyed their food.  I always like Chili's and this time was no different.  It's a good place for American style food with healthy options available as well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon?start=20
Andrea M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,18,,3.0,3/27/2016,Purchased the chicken fried steak. Corn was good fries were ok but the steak was mostly breading. The server was excellent and it was very busy. The triple berry margarita was delicious. It was a little more pricey than I remember.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon?start=20
Daya C.,"Oklahoma City, OK",13,22,13,3.0,7/15/2014,Came here for dinner with friends. We were seated within 10 minutes of arrival. The waitress was friendly. The food selection is plentiful. The quality of the food would be around 2-3 stars out of 5. Nothing fabulous to right home about but not a bad place to go for dinner. I do appreciate the games they have available on the tablet-this was helpful to keep the youngsters occupied. The wait time for the food was a little lengthy- around 20 minutes.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon?start=20
Brian F.,"Oklahoma City, OK",1,15,,2.0,10/19/2014,Food was good but had to pay $5.09  for a Michelob Ultra long neck. That is more expensive than a Vegas drink!!! Never again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon?start=20
DeLaughter B.,"Yukon, OK",15,16,,1.0,5/15/2015,"This place is HORRIBLE and after several, well, let's give 'em one more chance....FAIL, again.  What restaurant in Oklahoma doesn't get that serving a hamburger with RAW meat is a bad idea ?  That's the last straw for me....it's over and I am DONE with this place (overpriced by the way) and they will have to make it without my money (note: the one full star is WAY more than they should get. Move on folks....you can get a REAL HAMBURGER at the Miller Grill that will leave you smacking your lips for days.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon?start=20
Alan H.,"Yukon, OK",0,6,,1.0,9/19/2014,For starters...the girls who work up front seating guests have no clue as to what they are doing.  Probably not getting trained.  They were not busy at all...but it still took us 10 minutes to be seated.  We noticed that the girls working up front were also clearing tables and cleaning them.  Our table was not very clean and the salt and pepper shakers were very sticky.  We ordered the fajitas and the beef was very fatty and had no flavor.  The chicken had a strange orange color and it also had no flavor.  The food was very poor.  We had not eaten at Chili's in Yukon Oklahoma for over 2 years...but decided to give them another try.  We won't be going back ever again.  Terrible service and cleanliness !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yukon?start=20
