Shameka P.,"Yuma, AZ",9,20,54,5.0,6/30/2017,"Went out for a birthday dinner for me and my mom and it was amazing! I had the new Crispy Fiery Pepper Crispers and the new Coconut State Of Mind drink. Be prepared for the hot goodness that will enter your mouth. Just as a warning the heat delivers, but there is a hint of sweet in the sauce. The Coconut State of Mind was also great drink, I went light on the alcohol, so it would probably be better with the normal amount of alcohol. The service was great our waiter Casey was great, super chill dude, he made sure that are meal was okay and checked up on us regularly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yuma
Philip M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,18,,1.0,8/3/2017,"I came to Chilis after a hard day's work, expecting Danielle, who I have seen before on Thursday nights.  She wasn't there and I should have walked out.  A young lady who couldn't muster a smile asked me for a drink first and I requested a martini.  She made it perfect but alas was at the end of her shift.  Enter the stoner... Her replacement was some stoner with the obligatory arm tattoos and a baseball cap.    He looked at my martini and admitted he couldn't make one if I wanted another.  (strike one!).  He took my dinner order and I told him what I wanted but because he had the memory of a gnat, I had to repeat myself which I did all day on my job and don't expect to do it again for a casual dinner.(strike two!).  The dinner came and sure enough he got one of the sides wrong (strike three!!! You're out).  When he asked if I wanted another martini I was afraid of what I'd get. I spoke to the manager who offered to comp everything and I refused.  I am not looking for freebees.  I would like to go out after an aggravating day and chill out.  I used to live in Las Vegas and the bartenders/waiters can take an entire order without writing it down.   Shouldn't we elevate our expectations to other wait staff in other cities?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yuma

Kerri M.,"Yuma, AZ",0,10,2,3.0,5/8/2017,Went with family for lunch when they opened at 11:00 on a Sunday. Not terribly busy. The waitress was nice. I ordered the prime rib steak tacos with corn tortillas. I should have asked if the tacos came fried! Most horrible taco I have ever had. The rice and beans were cold as was the greasy hard taco. I guess they were waiting on my husbands fajitas before they brought the rest of the food out for our party of 6. I have never had any issues with the food here but this is as the worst. I will say the watermelon margarita was awesome,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yuma
Haley B.,"Yuma, AZ",2,2,,2.0,9/20/2016,"Worst customer ever.  Took a good 10 minutes before someone even noticed that my family came to the front to be seated. Employees walked by but no one mad it apparent that we were waiting or needed help. Then towards the end of our dinner the waitress disappeared and we waited for awhile on someone to come deliver the dessert or to ask if we needed anything else. The first part of dinner was great and the waitress made her appearance a lot but after we got our food , it took atleast 30 minutes for her to even make an appearance again.

Paul J.,"Yuma, AZ",75,528,1401,5.0,10/30/2015,"I have been here a few times and always had a good experience. Tonight I was alone after a movie and was pleasantly surprised that the kitchen is open till 11 on Fridays. I decided to sit at the bar and the bartender was cleaning but noticed me right away and greeted me warmly. I ordered the bacon avocado chicken sandwich and substituted a salad (for a small cost) but they no longer have caesar. Instead they offer a house salad but what really excites me is that the offer what the call a fresco salad. It's spring mix with queso fresco and honey lime vinaigrette. It's fresh and full of flavor. You can't go wrong with juicy chicken, cilantro pesto, avocado and bacon on a warm pretzel roll. This salad sandwich combo is so good I'm going to eat it regularly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yuma
Wendi A.,"Yuma, AZ",0,10,28,1.0,2/19/2017,"Probably the worse experience I've had in a while, after sitting for 30 mins, we had to go ask to be taken our order since there was no waiter around thAt cared enough to take our order. We got no forks, no napkins no straws, we were lucky enough to get our drinks at this point. The waiter was so careless, like his laid back attitude was nice at first until it started affecting the way or lie service was, we got appetizer and it was okay after we had to ask and wait for every single thing whenever he would come around like can I give us napkins, even the straws we had to to get them ourselves at the bar,  when our food came in , it was just bad ..... my Nieces burger was not cooked and my chicken strips were over cooked and dry and nasty , when my niece told the server about her burger he didn't say anything and just left, the manager came to say well the meat is never frozen so you can even eat rare and you would be okay .. as if that was the point.

Can't go wrong with the chips and queso. Wish we got more burger bites, they were very good. We both wanted more of those.  The egg rolls were pretty tasting too. The guy come with tea before it was empty, we drink a lot of tea. Better just bring us a pitcher.  Had a little problem getting started, but after we did, no more problems.  Place was clean.  We walking down, the parking can suck. It's busy down in this area.  You can only get happy hour in the bar area.  $24 for us to get our grub on.

Melanie L.,"Lemon Grove, CA",1,119,,5.0,7/29/2016,"Now I have had some bad Chili's experiences, but this was not one of them. Stopping on our way home to San Diego, from Colorado, last Saturday, we took a chance on Chili's. Glad we did.  I ordered the club that came with turkey, deliciously cooked bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and avocado on lightly toasted wheat bread.  It was neat, it was proportional, it was done right and it was delicious.  The fries served with it were delicious too, hot, fresh, and crispy.  I was not sharing.  Perfection would have included a spear of crunchy dill pickle. My husband got the smothered smoked chicken burrito that was huge and delicious.  Rice and beans that came with it good too.  He could not finish the whole thing and if we had refridgeration, we would have taken it with us. One daughter ordered the cajun chicken penne pasta and everyone really liked it, her included. One daughter ordered the chicken enchilada with sour cream sauce and that was really tasty too.  Personally, I really liked it too. Youngest ordered mac n cheese kid meal.  She went nuts over the ""just like home"" mac n cheese.  (I think she was talking about the blue box we sometimes make).  It was creamy, not dry and it was really a good sized portion. Lastly, the girls ordered the brownie dessert with ice cream on top, topped with toffee. Had a taste, delicious.  Not a bit left. Service was good.  Bathrooms and table were clean.  Food was really, really good. I hope they have the same menu here in San Diego.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yuma

Trudy W.,"Houston, TX",2,8,2,2.0,1/10/2016,"First off, I am a big fan of Chili's. I have loved Chili's since my first visit in 1980. Some Chili's are a hit or a miss.  This Chili's is a MISS. I have dined at this Chili's once to twice a week over the last two weeks during our YUMA season. My food is luke warm at best. Yes, I have brought this to the manager's attention. Consistently our food is luke warm. Never hot. The menu has changed over the years and what they did best: chili tacos and burgers they have moved away from to compete with Tex Mex. Down the street is a little place that never serves luke warm food and in my opinion would give the Cheese Cake Factory's burgers a run for their money.  We will dine at Eddies until Chili's address the temperature of their food. I gave them a two because I once loved Chili's. It should be a Zero now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yuma?start=20

We ordered 2 simple appetizers and the quality of the product was terrible. Fried pickles (one of my personal favorites) was not thoroughly cooked to only an off white color and the batter just didn't stick to the pickles, also they did not drain grease, it looked like it came directly from fry grease to plate!  Chips and salsa with fresh made guacamole tasted okay, the guacamole had several nickle sized pieces of avacado skin and also over ripe avocado.  The last time we had been there over a year ago I was dissatisfied with the product and made an online complaint on the Chlilis website, no more going back for food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yuma?start=20

I had to go to the front hostess and tell her that I've been waiting back there. She said she'd let somebody know. I waited for another 5 minutes while I could physically see employees standing around doing nothing and talking like trash. All the ladies were using fouls language and talking about a party that apparently they had attended over the weekend. It was off-putting. So I finally got my food and got out of there. When I got back to my hotel I discovered that they had not given me any dressing for my salad and forgot the beans that was supposed to come as a side with my tacos.

When they were delivered, the guy just dropped them next to me. The expo ticket was still on the tray and the ranch had tomato and avocado in it that had probably dropped in there and not been pulled out. When he dropped it the ranch spilled all over the lettuce. I then ordered the southwest smokehouse burger and went for the turkey patty option. I asked Dee, my server, if this had mayo on it because I absolutely cannot stand mayo. She said ""No sir just the BBQ sauce"" perfect. Much to my surprise, my burger comes out with about 2 tablespoons of mayo on it!!! I brought it to her attention and she said she would go get me a new bottom bun. She came back a moment later with a bottom bun and a wilted piece of lettuce. I asked about the pickles and tomatoes and all the other stuff that came on the burger and she went back try again. She returned the final time with the bottom bun setup in a bag and to go box. She was nice but come on poeple. If you mess up a sandwich, take the whole sandwich to the kitchen and make it right. Don't make me rebuild my food that you messed up.

Ann D.,"Rochester, NY",0,12,,1.0,4/30/2014,"Last time I was at this location was 2 weeks ago with my mother. We sat at the booths in the bar area and needless to say this visit was hands down the worst visit ever!! Not only did the waitress take forever to bring us drinks, there were flies all over the place. The dining experience was not at all what I was hoping for. We opted to switch seats but saw flies were at other tables. This is not appealing to the customers when eating. Won't be coming back anytime soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yuma?start=40
Daniel G.,"Long Beach, CA",137,12,,2.0,10/5/2011,The food was great but the service was sub par to say the least. Over 20 minutes for a salad seems a little excessive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yuma?start=40
Bill D.,"Monterey Park, CA",122,37,13,3.0,9/6/2011,I thought the service was very slow and the food was just ok.  I have been to many Chili's over the years and this one was just ok.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yuma?start=40
John P.,"Phoenix, AZ",39,161,11,2.0,10/3/2008,"It has to be Yuma.  Last time on the trip back we  did Appleby's ( this was prior to iPhone and yelp so some slack please)  and they managed to immolate the ribs.      The manager must have  canned that cook  since he's apparently  now working at the  Chili's across the road.   Appetizers took quite a while to come out at 1400 with hardly anyone in the place  but that's ok since it was wrong order.  I declined a ""do over"" since we were traveling and frankly the habanero wings don't go well with main entree  if you actually want to taste any of it. They made them and gave them to me , gratis ,anway.  Coffee was weaker than either parties economics skills ( seriously ) and no amount of sweeteners could make it fly.   It's like they'd taken out all the coffee then paid someone to replace it with grounds that no one wanted yet were lying around.   The rest wasn't too bad.  Buffalo like fajitas  ( I know wrong word but most people understand it )   The bed of peppers it was meant to be on was  sparse, the onions  were hiding under the  peppers.This is the first time I've had more meat than veg with this dish  at any chili's.     While I did get the order free it really wasn't required, e.g asked them not to try again , yet they still did which is why a  2.5 is now a  solid 2.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yuma?start=40
Alysia W.,"East Bay, CA",3301,592,72,3.0,1/28/2009,"Just another typical Chili's.. nothing special or outstanding about it. On the upside it isn't one of the lack luster twigs of the branch. If you're looking for what you would usually expect from this place, then definitely stop by.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yuma?start=40
Albert H.,"Scottsdale, AZ",117,1223,281,3.0,7/29/2009,"Given that this is the pathetic town of Yuma, sometimes you feel like you have to take refuge in a chain where the food will be at least reliably average.  Their $20 deal with an appetizer, two entrees, and desert is a bargain right now.  Good service, clean tables & atmosphere, and the food was like it is at any other chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yuma?start=40
Nomadic T.,"Yuma, AZ",0,198,19,3.0,10/14/2012,Nice laid back alternative to BW3s also in the mall..Just a few tvs on without sound. Food was very good for Chilis. Nice place for a quick bite and a beer or three.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yuma?start=40
B S.,"Murrieta, CA",8,80,42,3.0,10/21/2008,"I usually come here for lunch and have ok service. Out of the 6 or 7 times this past year, only once have I had really slow service and they gave me the wrong order as well. Maybe it was just the server that had everything wrong, but she brought out the right order the second time pretty fast. I've probably only been here during dinner once, and ordered a strawberry margarita and reminded the server to sugar the rim (not salt) and he brought out salt rimmed glasses. Come to find out, it was the manager who made them. He apologized and made new ones, and still charged us for the drinks, but whatever, I would still come here because I love their honey chipotle chicken crispers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yuma?start=40
