Jessica S.,"San Diego, CA",235,920,2051,3.0,11/15/2017,"I mean, it's a CPK. You know what you're in for when you step in. You should, at least. My friend and I were in Anaheim for the weekend, up to celebrate our birthdays the only way we know how: a weekend full of Disney geekiness. We drove up midday on Friday, checked in to our hotel, hopped over to a spa for a facial and massage, and as we were driving back to our hotel, we both realized that we hadn't eaten anything all day. It was almost 7 pm by then. We were starving, and CPK was the only restaurant that had no wait at that time. We got a table on the patio because though it was 7 pm in October, it was still hot as balls. Our waitress was sweet, but golly, she took her time getting to us. Never a good thing when you're famished, you know? Once we were able to place our orders, we got the Spicy Buffalo Cauliflower to share. I went with the Wild Mushroom Strozzapreti and my friend got the Banh Mi Bowl. We of course also ordered cocktails, because vacation. The food took forever to get to us, but at least we had bread to gnaw on. When we did get fed (and had our second round of cocktails - we each got the sangria flight), the food was okay. I think I liked mine a lot more than my friend liked hers, which is unfortunate because she was the one most feeling the need for food. She had to ask for extra dressing for her bowl because she said everything was so dry. She didn't seem to like the flavors of the meal, either. My pasta dish was okay. It was saucy but not very flavorful. I powered through the dish in record time, then sat there feeling like a pig and wondering if I was satiated. Side note - there was an altercation on the street outside of CPK while we were sitting there. The police were called, and at one point, the CPK manager came out to check on us. It was nice of them to be concerned, at least.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-anaheim-2

Matt F.,"Yonkers, NY",45,401,540,4.0,9/11/2017,"Tasty.  I was staying in the Anaheim area and this was located in the Anaheim Gardenwalk, so we decided to give this place a try. Was so dependable, that we came here at least 4 times during our visit.  The pizza is good and light. While the pizza is good, it's of course going to have a different taste than most pizzeria slices. A personal pie is probably the equivalent of 2 regular pizzeria slices for a size comparison. The one thing I wasn't exactly a fan of was the prices, which were high with what you were getting. A kid's pie and 1 personal pie was over $20 - but I had no real complaints, since it was a filling option with minimal wait. The pizza always tasted great. I only ordered takeout, so no comments on the dining in experience. The staff in which I encountered were always friendly and courteous.  Located on the Katella side of the Gardenwalk next to PF Chang.  A good option if you're in the area, whether you live or are staying in the vicinity.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-anaheim-2
Lesley C.,"West Covina, CA",422,521,24,3.0,7/30/2017,"Came here last Sunday night (7/23/17) prior to the concert at HOB Anaheim and there were just so many problems during our meal... 1. Dirty Plates and etc. No silverware and napkins. 2. Chicken Tequila Fettuccine Undercooked pasta and burnt. 3. Pizza Dough Rewards Processing the rewards is as slow as molasses. Ordered: 1/2 Waldorf Chicken Salad Chicken Tequila Fettuccine 1/2 Thai Crunch Salad Gluten-Free Crust Roasted Garlic Chicken Having been to the GardenWalk multiple times over the years, I've been to Cheesecake Factory, Bubba Gump, and now CPK. The GardenWalk is conveniently located nearby to the Convention Center and the nearby hotels so there are often lots of tourists around so some restaurants can get pretty packed. Having known that, we decided to try the ""Call Ahead"" feature where one can call up to 1-hr ahead prior to arriving at the restaurant and get priority seating.  We called ahead and arrived within 30 minutes of the time we stated and did have priority seating. There were a few groups waiting here and there but also lots of empty tables. It seems that they were short servers, thus half the restaurant was empty.  The plates initial plates on the tables still had food encrusted on them and I had to ask Franky, our server, to switch one of the plates out. We were sat at a table of 4 for the 2 of us but it worked out because our 2 other friends were able to join us for dinner prior to the concert at HOB.  Granted, I haven't had the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine in years but I do not remember it being this poorly cooked. I had the hardest time trying to figure out why my pasta wasn't al dente but there were burnt marks also. So they undercooked the pasta and then tossed it with the sauce but let it sit on the burner too long and burned the bottom. There were lots of ingredients but the noodles themselves were quite disappointing and that is what makes the dish a pasta.  We didn't have enough time to head to a coffee shop nearby and decided to order coffee here, there was something black inside of my creamer container. I am guessing it is a pepper or something but what is it doing in the container?  When our other 2 friends joined us for dinner, no utensils/napkins or even bread were brought over for them. The two of us had already finished our bread and was starting our main dishes so there obviously was not bread for them. I had to go ask for menus from the hostesses and also grab utensils for them when their food was brought after they ordered.  When we were paying for our bill, it took a very long time. I had mentioned at the beginning of the meal that I had a dough reward and Franky mentioned I could provide my phone number or email address at the end of the meal. A bit of a tedious process as I had to write it on the check and then have him re-run and then have the manager apply the dough rewards. It took over 10 minutes having the manager apply the rewards. We were running a bit later than we had expected and hoped to pay and head over to HOB but this was the part that took the longest. Even my friends who had only 1 card for one check, took them the same amount of time. It seems that the servers do not clear the check and that the manger does it. I am also guessing only 1 credit card machine. For a restaurant located on the GardenWalk, I expected more efficiency as they must have high volume of customers during busy times. Â  They do validate for 1 hour and can be validated by the server when paying for your meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-anaheim-2
Jenn K.,"Cerritos, CA",78,246,66,4.0,10/26/2017,"This place and location are great since theres hardly a wait unless you come with a group of 10.

I was surprised since i don't really mix it up that much once i find my favorite dishes.

Karen L.,"Rowland Heights, CA",247,340,482,4.0,4/19/2017,"Lunch on Saturday, 3/25/17 Our large party of 10 came by after a matinee showing at Downtown Disney. The parking structure had plenty of parking spots around 1pm. With our restaurant validation, parking was free. The wait was about 15 minutes for the server to set up our table. Even though our party was quite large, the server was great in following up on our orders. He came to assist us with refills and additional condiments when he was available since the restaurant was full. The complimentary bread comes with olive oil instead of butter. It's been a while since I've visited a CPK. I ordered the Original BBQ Chicken Pizza to get a refresher of how great it tasted. It's not loaded with too many toppings and it still has quite a thin hand-tossed crust so I was able to finish it. The crust was crispy and soft enough to bite through. I didn't have room to order anything else with my meal after the nachos and soda from the movie theater. It's definitely a recommended place whenever there's a pizza craving. I remember liking the Kung Pao spaghetti and the Original BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad.

After a long day at Disneyland we wanted to get out of the park and eat close by. We saw CPK was close and hopped in the car. (About 7 mins from Disneyland). I have to make a notable mention to Tommy the manager here who saw we were with hungry kids and made sure we got our food very quickly. He went ABOvE and BeyOND to take care of us. CPK is mt favorite chain restaurant and the food is always good. But it was Tommy who took the experience to another level by the exceptional customer service he provided us. It was unforgettable.

Greeters welcome you, servers are accommodating and knowledgeable about their offerings. I never had a bad experience at any of their locations. In fact, CPK is one of my top 10 favorite restaurant chains. Try the Kung Pao Spaghetti. It's a signature dish that can only be found here. I know, the name sounds a tad bit strange but it is absolutely 'Da Bomb"" for the lack of a better description. Add chicken and shrimp. You'll need to wash your meal down with a fresh strawberry mango cooler. I mean, I could probably drink those all day and night but then again I wouldn't get any sleep. They are non-alcoholic.

Lawrence D.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",368,109,123,3.0,2/19/2017,"Every restaurant at Anaheim Garden Walk was packed and the average wait for a party of 5 was about 1.5 hours. The wait at CPK was only 50 mins so we decided to stay because we were starving.  The wait wasn't too bad and the greeter was really nice.  After we were seated the first thing I noticed is that CPK has really moved away from highlighting their pizzas on the menu. I was a little disappointed as I've been a fan of their pizzas since 1990. There was a ton of other stuff on the menu that I didn't even know they served like steak, fish, and pasta.  The food took a while to get to the table and the waiter didn't really check in with us but hey, I get it, it was packed and it was really busy.  We ordered the plank Salmon, a pasta dish, arugula salad and a kids pizza. The sizes were a little small and the taste was kinda average. Not bad, but just average. Now the key is that if you are going to serve smaller dishes then the taste needs to be BIG. and they just didn't accomplish that.

I thought the soup would be in one bowl that was split into two. However, it's served in the same bowl.  -BBQ chicken salad: Can never go wrong with this salad. Always delicious  -Chipotle chicken pizza: My favorite pizza!! Love all the toppings on this pizza.  I was a bit disappointed with the service though.

Andrew O.,"Tustin, CA",185,69,18,2.0,11/2/2016,"Located in Anaheim's GardenWalk, California Pizza Kitchen (hereafter referred to CPK) is a beautiful interior in a fine location, heck, it's located next to the happiest place on earth, how could it not be a sweet spot?  Although they make their pizzas by hand (and you can see chef's tossing pizza dough behind the counter), there are very few modifications that can be made to any of the items on the menu because most of the food is pre-made. So right away, if you're particular about your food or want to pay for freshly created food, this is not the spot for you.  The food itself was okay just like any CPK. For the money you're paying, though, I'd expect the quality to be better. It's like Applebee quality food with Outback Steakhouse prices.  We had a party of five, we all ordered cocktails, beer, and speciality drinks, we ordered two appetizers, and an entree apiece, and yet our waiter tried to upsell us with EVERY. SINGLE. SENTENCE. Look I'm not against the upsell, I get it, but it was just this intense back and forth. For example: Me ""I'll get the lettuce wraps"" Waiter, ""Would you like chicken and shrimp on that? Chicken and shrimp are my personal favorite.""  Me ""Sure, we'll get chicken and shrimp. And we'll have the BBQ chicken pizza."" Waiter, ""Ok, would you like bacon and pineapple on that? Those are my personal favorite I'm a huge fan."" And everything we ordered was like that. It's like, calm down bud, we're already ordering appetizers and drinks (two rounds) and whatnot, you don't have to go so hard. We aren't being chincy and ordering water for the table. I can only assume this is management's directive which is why I'm not singling out our waiter by name but check yourself CPK, when people come to spend money they want to be treated with respect, not like cheap human beings whom you have to hard sell for every additional dollar. Heck, three of our five person party showed up a few minutes before the rest and we paused at the front door to see if the other two had arrived and a hostess had sprung out of the restaurant asking us if we had any questions about the menu -- calm down now, we're already eating at you establishment, no need to reel us in.  The water and drinks took forever. At least 20 minutes for water. So service was mediocre, and it wasn't busy so no excuse there.

(Pretty sure the kid that bagged up my order was new, it happens). I called them to let them know I was going to come back and was placed on hold so she could grab someone to help me. I got in my car to drive back and was left on hold the entire time. As I walked up to the counter a guy answered and told me sorry for the wait (30 minutes into it!). I was beyond irritated by this point so I asked for a manager.  The man I spoke to was polite, listen to my complaint and was quick to fix the issue. He explained that the toppings are boxed separately (warm chicken and veggies) and grabbed the two containers that had been left. He asked me if I would like the whole thing redone and guaranteed me that they would figure out what happened for the hold time. He then refunded my ticket. Not one time did he offer an excuse or try to defend what happened. Just heard my complaint, apologized and fixed it.  Driving there I was ready to leave an aweful review (messed up order, 30 minute hold time and a 20 minute drive back so they could fix it). But the professionalism of the manager changed my experience. I've worked in restaurants before and I know mistakes happen it's what's done after that can make it or break it, they did well.  I had never ate there before. Once my salad had all the pieces it was fantastic! I will definitely try it again. Great job changing a cappy situation into something positive!

Another thing, my order was a Cali sandwich which had to have chicken,avocado, bacon and lettuce. But was more lettuce than anything else AND NO BACON added to my sandwich. The waiter came back with some after I had told her and when she brought it I had already finished my sandwich. To top it off, it was COLD bacon. Didn't like it at all.

Once we arrived, we checked in and waited about 10 minutes before our table was ready. I have to say the customer service here was impeccable!!! It was probably the best restaurant experience I've had in a very long time.  Alex was our waiter tonight. It was a busy night and we all knew we would have to be patient. He checked in on us often and made sure we weren't forgotten! He had a great attitude and personable character. He not only highlighted our evening there tonight, but definitely made us want to come back again and again. He deserves a glowing review and certainly earned our loyalty to this location alone.

Nick W.,"Austin, TX",149,115,19,1.0,6/23/2016,"Results may vary. So me and my friends wanted to go to a near by restaurant that we found was closed for private event so we decided to check out this place. We went and it was busy, it was like 7:30 dinner rush, so yes this might be bad and I don't typically put places on blast but I had a bad time here so now for the main story. We walk in and see someone we know working they suggest the bar so we check it out and see its full except for the end, but we see a table and ask is it cool if we take this unused table and they say no. Then two girls walked up a minute after to the same waitress and they said that it was completely fine. As we Awkwardly sat split on the handicapped bar set up and one at average bar height seat so I'm kinda miffed about that but then that lady took those ladies orders and slipped us, and instead of telling the bartenders to remember us we sat there for ten minutes before someone got us drinks and the ladies got food. Then the server got to us ten minutes after that. Meanwhile we held menus in the air to be served. Honestly disappointed greatly with service, but like I said results may vary.  The salads took around 17 mins with another wait for our silverware. We could have eaten faster if we waited for a table. By the time we started eating the ladies who took the table we were denied were gone.

Upon calling we were told that we could walk back for another pizza, otherwise the cost of the Truffle Oil would be refunded. Who, seriously, on vacation, at Disneyland nonetheless, after walking 10+ miles with another early morning and busy day ahead, now wants to spend another 40 minutes walking back and forth to make up for CPK's lack of due diligence?

We have gone twice recently and have had good experiences both times. My husband is on the pizza dough points club and the first time was able to get a free small plate. (Basically an appetizer) We went with the chicken tinga quesadillas. They were tiny, but good. At least it was free. I had gone with the bbq chicken pizza and loved it. My husband had the garlic cream fettuccini. He added chicken (at 2.79 and not much chicken), but boy was it tasty. Great service, on top of drink refills, friendly, gave you all options, etc. We went back recently. This time his pizza dough points had a $10 off $40 or more. Awesome.  Both times I had the frozen raspberry lemonade. (Yummy). This time for a meal I went with the garlic cream fettuccini but I did not add the chicken. My husband had the tostada pizza and added lime chicken for around 1.79 or so. It looked like a gigantic tostada! Great service again. On top of everything. Appetizers were offered but we declined. Recommendations on yummy food items were made, and dessert was offered. We went with the butter cake and added ice cream. A bit pricey, but they weren't chinsy on the size like most places and desserts. Wow! That was deeeeelicious! Now it might be a must item dang it! TRY IT!!!!

Q. M.,"Chicago, IL",11,99,109,2.0,8/30/2015,"On vacation again for Disney and this restaurant is across the street from my hotel. I ordered a new item...tricolor salad pizza. Since it was take away, the 'breading/pizza' part came in a pizza box while the salad and vinaigrette came in a separate container. The description on the website indicated the pizza crust would be a parmisean crust...I've made one myself before but only used actual parmisean...melted it down and formed a crust like form (thin and crunchy). This pizza however used a very, very, very hard to chew bread with parmisean crumbles on top. I'm not one to complain about bread being chewy...I take home blue bayou bread and eat for 3 days...stale and chewy bread is ok with me but this crust was hard to even tear into smaller pieces in order to crumble on top of the salad. I only ate 1 (ONE!) Slice of the pizza bread and half of it I had to tear up in order to try to enjoy it on top of the salad. My effort was futile because the fork they provided wouldn't penetrate the bread anyway!  Salad was good...seemed 1-2 day old greens. The vinaigrette was ok but they could probably do much better if the tried. If I decide to get a salad again here, I will just ask for a side of red wine vinegar instead. Don't get me wrong...I ate the salad but it was a small amount of greens compared to the size of the crust and I had wished I ordered a plain old salad in the end cause I threw out the remaining crust.  It's a chain restaurant and I don't expect much but you can't expect stars for screwing up pizza breading. I just won't order that item again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-anaheim-2?start=60

They have options to combine a soup, salad, sandwich, or pizza. This location is also beautiful. There is a great ambiance inside and it really is quite nice.

Steven C.,"Anaheim, CA",891,654,8175,4.0,1/24/2014,"This was my first time at this particular California Pizza Kitchen location but it was definitely a good one. Â We arrived early as we typically do to beat the dinner rush and were quickly seated inside. Â The server quickly took our drink order and asked if we wanted any appetizers. Â I had recently joined the Pizza Dough club which entitled me to a free small plate. Â Having never used this before the server very nicely showed me how to use the app and check into our location so he could get the three digit code to use for our order. Â  After looking over the options quickly we settled on ordering the spicy chicken tinga quesadilla for our small plate. Â The order quickly came out the presentation was nice and the quesadilla (more like quesadilla bites) were quite good. Â They gave off a very light heat from the ranchito sauce and pepper jack cheese but not enough to bother my wife who really has no tolerance for spicy foods. Â Despite the great flavor these were a bit lacking to me as 4 small bites of quesadilla for 5.49 seems a bit excessive but after all they do call it a small plate and they meant it, lol. For my meal I decided to go with the Garlic Cream Fettucinne with added chicken and was very pleased with the dish. Â The garlic flavor was very nice and the chicken was just enough to add another layer to the overall taste of the dish. Â The fettuccine itself was 10.99 but the chicken was an additional 2.75 so the pricing could be better but it was decent enough for the portion I received. Â I topped off my dish with some parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper flakes. Â I would definitely recommend this dish and will for sure order this again on a future visit. Â My wife had to sample to pasta herself after saying how good it looked and she too approved. Overall we had a pleasant experience here for dinner which I was worried about after reading several reviews regarding terrible service but luckily we experienced none of these issues. Â I am sure we will be back soon as they offer a large and varied menu with several other dishes catching my eye as well.

Kristin Leigh M.,"Las Flores, CA",701,1127,1789,2.0,11/9/2013,"Yuck, what happened to CPK? I grew up eating CPK pizza and loved it. Great memories, great pizza. Recently (though I'm not sure how recently, as I haven't been in about a year), they rolled out a new menu. New starters, new crust, new pizzas. Yuck. Why change something that is good, that people have grown love and expect? Yes, some of the new starters are pretty good. We had the avocado wrap things -- nice, crispy, flavorful -- and the mac and cheese bites. I must've missed where the mac and cheese things were stuffed fried nugget-like things. Nevertheless, they were pretty good, just luke-warm. I wouldn't order them again though, just a strong sense of being fried and clogging my arteries.  My issue comes down to the pizza. Some classic pizzas (like the BLT) are no longer on the menu. And the new dough is TERRIBLE. The pizza was so doughy, it became disgusting. I always finish my pizza, but instead I felt bloated with dough. Also, the dough used to have a slightly sweet taste. This had no flavor. Yuck.  I have no idea why CPK is trying to become something else -- why they are trying to reinvent themselves. If this is what they've decided on for the ""new them,"" then I can see why they were the only restaurant in the GardenWalk that didn't have a wait at 7:30 p.m. on a Friday night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-anaheim-2?start=60

We got to the restaurant at 4:45pm (based on our parking structure ticket), and didn't get to leave until 6:15pm. The restaurant was NOT busy at ALL. Our server appeared to have our table and one next to us. They were a table of two, and we were a table of two adults and one child. Everything was pretty normal up until we put our order in. After that, our server seemed to mentally and physically check out of serving. When he first brought our drinks, he was missing one straw, and said he'd bring one right over. It took him FIFTEEN minutes to come back with ONE straw. Then we asked for a water for the little one, and another straw (since one had dropped on the floor), and that took another ten minutes. Then he brought our food, and we had to ask for a second plate, since we were sharing a dish, and ranch. Mind you, we had asked for this second plate when we placed the order, since we were sharing. He came back about 7 minutes later with JUST THE RANCH. We asked for a plate AGAIN, and he brought it back in a few minutes. The chicken in the kids plate we ordered was stringy and gristly, and we wanted to let the server know, but he NEVER came back to check on us. As the other part of my party went to the restroom, twice with the little one, the server was spotted standing at the end of the bar, counting his money and chatting with a fellow employee. As I went to the restroom, I saw the same thing. So three times he was spotted in the same place, NOT checking on us. So as we are sitting there, not able to ask a question, or replace our food, we then saw our server standing near the kitchen with his SUNGLASSES on and keys in hand. Mind you, he's facing us, and still not fazed that he hasn't checked on us, or even brought us the check or anything. About 5 minutes later, we watched him walk out of the restaurant. I then had to get up to ask someone to see a manager to find out what is happening with us, the server followed me to the table and asked if she could get us anything (I'm then picking up the fact that we were her problem now, and she realized she hasn't checked on us either.) A few minutes after that, the manager then came by and asked how we were, and we then told him all that was wrong. He himself had a bit of an attitude about it, but said he understood and will talk to them, and doesn't condone the behavior. He took care of the child's meal, and offered to box the rest of our pizza, but at this point we just wanted to get the hell out of the restaurant.

Jennelle L.,"Placentia, CA",394,61,169,1.0,3/23/2016,"We had a party of 12 and 3 kids. We were celebrating my nephew's party. If you get Alex as your server, Â good luck. He seemed a bit frazzled, maybe because we had a big party? But the place was empty. We arrived at 430pm and the place was dead. As he served everyone else drinks in my party (I came 5 min later than everyone else) I asked for a sprite and water. He said he needed to tend to his other customers before he could get to me. Like he was busy or something. I kid you not, I saw one guy on his laptop, and a mother with her baby. We also asked for extra bread cuz he only served 2 small plates of bread to a party of 15. Anyway, whatever you do, don't order the fusili alfredo on the kids menu. There's nothing in it. They literally serve you cooked noodles that are naked. Maybe there is a teaspoon of what looks like milk. Not even cream, lol. I asked Alex if this how it always looks. He said that their recipe calls for light sauce. (Which is literally a teaspoon of milk.) He gave us extra sauce on the side. Too bad the consistency was of milk. I took the rest home since my son only took 3 bites. I'll have to jazz it up myself with some real sauce, lol. So if you enjoy CPK, I recommend Brea or Irvine.

Don't get me wrong they are great people, friendly & aware. But the awareness is what bothers me a tad bit. Just wish they are a bit more attentive and consistent with their customer table service.  My family and friends pretty much ordered the pasta plates whereas I ordered the Ciabatta Club sandwich with salad. What is funny is that all the pasta plates including the kids meal all arrived around the same time from one another. My meal however, the sandwich and salad, arrived 5 minutes later. The easiest meal to make & it arrives last and late.  Observations about the staff. The Greeter, some lady, loves to chit chat in the back with the staff. Rest of the Male Waiters try their best to keep up with the customers and their orders. My waiter was cool but it seems something was on his mind. There was this group who kept raising their hands to place their orders and was later served. So either they know that the Lunchtime crowd is slow or today was just one of those lazy days for the entire staff.  Maybe later this week I'll go their for dinner and see if there is a difference between the two staffs. The food is great and there were no complaints from anyone.

We were sitting on this nice leather couch located literally right next to the hostess, and none of us heard then calling anyone of our names, and there were five of us. So we waited about another 10 min, a total of about 50 min. As we were being seated, we were lead to a very small table with only three chairs...??? The hostess looked awkward and uncomfortable, whispered something into the the head set communicator, and took us to a different table.  We ordered food, family style, so that we can try out different dishes. Food came out, and none of us had silverware or napkins. Further, the dishes didn't accompany any serving spoons when we specified that we were ordering family style. I was there with my girl friends, and I wanted to treat, so I had discretely given my credit card to the server pretty much right after being seated.. Well, he must have forgotten about that, because he brought the check and placed on the table. I must have given him a look that reminded him of the previous arrangement, because as he was about to walk away, then he came back and simply picked up the check without saying anything.

The ingredients are fresh and good quality and I'm generally happy with the taste of their pizzas. The dough is a bit chewy is my only criticism. I personally SPIN or Pizza Press slightly better than CPK but that isn't a knock on CPK. Lastly, this isn't CPK's fault, but the parking situation at Gardenwalk sucks for take out orders. Other CPKs usually have a couple of spots reserved for them but that's not the case here.

Alicia D.,"Wayne, NJ",0,29,,5.0,8/21/2013,"This is by far the best California Pizza Kitchen location I have ever visited, so much so in fact that my group went there twice during the convention we were attending at the convention center which is within walking distance.  The first time we went was during lunch and while the restaurant was relatively empty, we did not feel like the servers were being lazy or like we were being overly loud or anything. Most seemed to order one of the salads and all have rave reviews. I do not remember the name of my salad but it had cold and warm components including corn, avocado, and artichoke and it was delicious. When we returned the second time for dinner there was about a 30 minute wait but it was kind of expected during dinner at a big convention. We ordered some more substantial entrees which included pizza and pasta all of which were good, nothing spectacular but nothing was bad either.  What really puts this location over the top was the fantastic service. Both times we had the same waiter and he was magnificent. He took custom orders, took mistakes back to the kitchen apologetically, asked us about our meal, and split the checks individually without being snarky. He also recommended we sign up for the app which enabled all of us to get a free small plate and gave us a free desert. At chain restaurants like CPK where the food is more or less the same service is make or break in the experience and our server made the experience great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-anaheim-2?start=160

Â My Korean beef small plate was pretty good; the plate consisted of two tacos with plenty of cabbage, scallions, and medium spicy sauce. Â Kind of reminded me of a western attempt at bulgogi and kimchi! Â Mediterranean plate: white bean hummus was rather bland, the 4 pita bread wedges were cold and oily, but the Greek salad was fine. Â We decided to share a piece of the key lime pie and really enjoyed it: creamy filling + Graham cracker crust = win. Service was ok. Â Don't expect out-of-this-world service or food.

We have been to this location before & it's usually packed during this time. We were seated right away & our server was awesome. Very attentive & super friendly.  We ordered one of the flatbreads which came out pretty quickly. The person who brought it out said a piece feel off the plate so they were going to make us a whole new one but still left the rest that didn't fall. Great service there!  My husband ordered the jumbalay & I had the asparagus & spinach spaghettini. Both dishes were very tasty & hearty portions as well.  What really made our night was when an employee named Kirby came to our table to see how everything was. We saw her throughout the night doing this with other tables. We thought she was the manager & thought this was excellent customer service. Anyway, she asked if we were celebrating anything & we told her it was an early Valentine's date for us. We also mentioned that we recently got married in December & never had a honeymoon so this was our chance to have a little time to ourselves without the kids. Kirby had a very bubbly personality & was just very sweet. She left our table & came back a little while later with a card signed by their staff congratulating us on our recent marriage! In addition to that, she also gave us a voucher that was good for a free appetizer on our next visit. I was simply blown away by her service!

Don't even ask... or do... but prepare for them to forget about 6 times before actually doing it. Top the night off, we were seated outside and mid-dinner we had COCKROACHES on the umbrella next to our table and a few underneath our feet!! THEY WERE ALIVE AND KICKIN'! This place went from one of my favorites to one of the worst places ever. Other than that, the food was pretty good. Hats off to the chefs who work hard, but sadly everything else sucked.

Swathy S.,"Chino Hills, CA",137,87,30,2.0,10/7/2013,The food I definitely do love and enjoy here but their service just erks me so much. They take forever to attend you and then they are not so sure about the options that they have for vegetarians which is quite annoying.  They give us the allergy menu and ask us to figure out what does and does not have meat. I think that was quiet unprofessional by them. I think the servers need to have more manners and attend their tables in a timely manner. I doubt I would go back here again.

So DO NOT order this second rate fried Mac & Cheese. DO order the steamed dumplings, they were light and the filling was on point and the sauce was perfect. Loved them. On to the main course, the pizza! So, my hubby had the Chipolte BBQ Chicken pizza, and I had the Margarita.  Was it good, yes. Was it something I would have to go back for?

We walked over to a block of chain restaurants including Cheesecake Factory, Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, PF Changs, and a California Pizza Kitchen. CPK seemed like the best option.

I got an everything pizza and my wife got her veggie sandwich. Our food was delicious and there were some little differences from our regular location in the Bay Area.

This CPK was a 2 minute walk away from our hotel. We came inside and it was no crowded at all. We were seated right away and basically given great service the entire night. I ordered the Asparagus and Spinach Spaghetti, requested without the parmesan cheese they sprinkled on top to make it vegan friendly. Boyfriend got a mushroom ravioli dish. We shared a a bowl of soup. The soup came out first and it was a tortilla vegetable soup or something I forgot. It was quite tasty and warmed up our bodies as it was chilly in the restaurant. My spaghetti was well made and I really enjoyed it. There was enough spaghetti to last 2 small meals (I took it to go and ate it for lunch the next day). the asparagus was kind of chewy though. It could have had more of a crunch to it. Overall, very satisfying. Boyfriend's ravioli, which I've had in the past, had nothing wrong with it. According to him, creamy, fatty, and filling. Alls well here. Our server was this upbeat outgoing and talkative woman who knew her specials. she KNEW them. She made us laugh and after dinner she gave us these CPK lottery cards or something but we never used it. a little over $10/person without drinks makes this a $30 meal for 2.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-anaheim-2?start=180

Erika L.,"San Lorenzo, CA",56,17,5,5.0,1/5/2014,"Gluten & Dairy Free!! I haven't gone to a cpk in years, since before my gluten/dairy free lifestyle. They are GIG approved so I had to try it. It did not disappoint, they had a gig approved menu. I ordered the mushroom pepperoni sausage pizza with no cheese. It was really good, the crust a little on the sweet side but good. And I didn't get sick! The manager brought out the pizza and it had a little certified Gluten free stick in it. They have other gluten free items but they can't certify GF. If your as sensitive as me to cross contamination stick with the GIG menu. Also they offer crisp in GF cider. Below ill copy and past from   about what makes it gig approved:  1) The Gluten Intolerance Group of North American (GIG) certifies restaurants that use the strict procedures approved by GIG. There are currently four ""GIG certified"" items on the CPK menu. They include the pizzas listed on the small menu above: GF Margherita, GF Chicken Barbecue, GF Mushroom Pepperoni Pizza and GF Pepperoni. 2) To be a ""GIG certified"" GF menu item at CPK, the food must be prepared in the new GF dedicated part of the kitchen and all of the ingredients used on the pizza must be from that dedicated area. For example, I requested goat cheese on my son's pizza since we don't do cow' milk cheese. They could not certify his pizza because the goat cheese comes from another part of the kitchen that is not certified. 3) You can order a different style pizza not listed on the above menu with the GF crust, but it will not be ""GIG certified."" 4) They use a blue sticker as seen below to seal all pizzas that are considered ""certified."" 5) The manager is supposed to deliver any certified GF pizza. It is to be delivered upon completion, even if it's done before the rest of the table's food so that it does not sit around and potentially become contaminated with flour/gluten. The manager is also supposed to wash his/her hands before handling the pizza. 6) There are other menu items listed as ""GF"" on their regular menu. These dishes are not considered ""GIG certified."" They are free of gluten ingredients but are not prepared in the dedicated part of the kitchen. The white corn guacamole and chips listed on the menu below is an example of this. This basically means that the dish is free of gluten ingredients but they cannot guarantee against cross contamination of gluten. I have inquired with CPK as to whether the chips are fried in dedicated oil but have not heard back yet. 7) CPK now uses rice flour to work all their pizza dough including wheat flour dough. This prevents the very small airborne flour molecules from contaminating the dedicated part of the kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-anaheim-2?start=200

I LOVE thin pizza but this thin pizza was not only paper thin (literally) was also so hard it was difficult to chew, and all my crust was burnt. Definitely went cheap on the pizzas for how much you paid. Might as well go to pizza hut or little Caesars for the same, if not better. We kept seeing them and wanted to try something new, the smell basically dragged us in. Don't let that fool you though. We didnt get utensils or napkins either.

Jennie K.,"Anaheim, CA",295,97,1,4.0,5/24/2011,"Boyfriend and I came here before going to Disneyland. The CPK here is located on the outskirts of Garden Walk, an extremely empty shopping Â center if you can even call it that, and we were seated right away by who I presume to be the manager. Our server was extremely nice, always checking up on us to see if we were doing alright, so a plus for customer service. Boyfriend and I ordered the original bbq pizza; absolutely love the spinach sauce/green stuff(?) they drizzle onto the pizza. I got the original bbq chicken chopped salad........which I ended up throwing up that same day due to my lightweight consumption of alcohol. :-( They are having a little promotion where they are giving sealed paper coupons to customers. You can't open it until your your next visit in which the manager has to open. Silly me, I opened it, which made my discount of 10% for next times visit pretty much unusable, but the waitress gave me one more.

Every other place I've been doesn't charge you if you've gone over your time. If you've visited a restaurant, bar, or theatre there they shouldn't charge you even after its been validated.

Me having the allergies and being picking when it comes to where we eat, they left the decision up to me. I decided on California Pizza Kitchen in Garden Walk. I had eaten at this particular location before and knew they had gluten free pizza and I really wanted pizza so we agreed to go there. You can imagine how annoyed I was when I found out that this location no longer had the gluten free crust. The waitress explained that there was a recent change in ownership and they dropped it for the time being and I don't know for sure if they will be bringing it back, but it was good when I had it before. They do have little 'gluten free' logos next to the items in the menu so you know what is gluten free. I ended up getting a salad. The caramelized peach salad. Although the peaches were not caramelized there were just grilled, it was still really good. It comes with Gorgonzola cheese, but I asked for no cheese. It was also really big too. They have a half size and the full size and the full size is $11 or so but it was worth it. I was expecting it to cost more so to me it was worth the price. And afterwards I rushed to costuming to change and go to work. -Charlotte ",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-anaheim-2?start=200

At the other CPKs when you order a salad they come to your table to put pepper on the salad for you. The server here didn't even ask us if we wanted pepper or not. Also at the other CPKs the manager goes to your table and ask you if like the food. Not here, the manager at this location was nowhere to be found. We tried asking for red pepper and cheese to go with our pizza and the waiter forgot about our request. This place is extremely understaffed when we were there. It's not even crowded, we saw about 10-15 people there including us and the chef had to take the food to the tables because there were not enough waiters. Service was extremely slow.

The tamale ravioli (why?) was a huge hit with my friend, but I really couldn't understand the reasoning behind it. My marsala was average, if a little bland.

My family of 4 came in for a late lunch around 3 on a slow Saturday afternoon--there were a total of maybe 5-6 parties including us there at the time and 3-4 waitresses + 1-2 busboys wandering around, so there was really no excuse for the long-ish gaps waiting for her to come by so we could ask for our check and then for boxes, etc.  But what really made the experience upsetting was our waitress's attitude--she was very cold and brusque/borderline rude from start to finish, and we weren't even a loud, rowdy crowd or complaining for extra this or that or anything like that--just a nice, quiet adult family of four. @_@ But I swear, every time she came by, she was just about bursting with irritation or something. Maybe something had ticked her off just before we'd come in and that made her a little snappish at the beginning--okay, I can forgive that. But we were there for a full meal and dessert (a good hour at least) and were perfectly polite through all of it up until the very end and she just couldn't crack a smile or look like she was remotely happy we were there (seriously? You don't want easy business during a slow afternoon? Don't want tips??).

A friend ordered the chipotle pizza it was like having a taco salad, taste better than it sounds.

Â  The good thing about CPK is if you don't like your food they have an adventure guarantee that if you try something new and not like you can return it for something else. The alcoholic drinks were strong and their signature drinks were tasty. The appetizer we ordered was the lettuce wraps with shrimp...it was good but the sauce was a little sweet for my taste. Â We had the red velvet cake for dessert and it was good but the cake part was too thick for my liking it wasn't fluffy.

Ken M.,"Hartford, CT",6,208,36,4.0,1/6/2011,"My friend from Carlsbad and I met in Anaheim and we were deciding where to go for dinner. There are a lot of great restaurant chains in the Anaheim Garden Walk. When he suggested California Pizza Kitchen, I balked. Pizza! Pizza in California, no way, I am from New England and we have the best pizza in the States, all styles, thick crust, Greek style, thin crust, Italian pies, and organic flat bread pizzas. Why should we go there. He replied that they have more than pizza: great salads, pastas, specialty items, sandwiches, great desserts, etc. So I relented. We parked in the parking garage, and as I looked longingly at Roy's as we passed by, we walked into California Pizza Kitchen and were greeted by a cheerful hostess. We asked to be seated away from groups of kids, and that was quite a feat as they were scattered throughout the restaurant. After moving around the restaurant on a scouting mission, we finally found what would be our table. As soon as we were seated an effervescent waitress full of energy and personality approached. I thought she and my friend were old friends, because they developed an immediate rapport, and that rapport was soon extended towards me. Her name is Samantha. We talked about the menu items, and ordered drinks. Sam suggested the pinot noir and I ordered a half glass to go with my CPK Cobb Salad w/blue cheese dressing. My friend ordered Tuscan Hummus and a series of other flat breads and iced tea to go with it. The salad arrived and there wasn't enough dressing on it for me, and Sam took care of that promptly. The salad was good: I would rate it as the second best Cobb salad I have had. Oh yes, I must add that the fresh beets were a nice touch with the salad. Sam kept on cruising back to the table asking if everything was alright, and I noticed that she kept that same energy up with all of her tables; she really is a ball of positive energy and definitely an asset to this restaurant. She alone moved this restaurant from a three to a four star rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-anaheim-2?start=280

However, my coworkers and I come here from time to time for birthday lunches. CPK has lots of variety so everyone can eat happy, and it's a good place to go for a group meal. However, a gripe about CPK in general is that they've raised some of their prices since I last went, so it's pretty pricey for a small thin-crusted pizza now. Your meal will probably cost around $15 for lunch, more for dinner! But, CPK pizza is delicious and does not disappoint.

Went to the Anaheim Gardenwalk location last night at about 8:15PM. There was a security company convention in town down the road at the Anaheim Convention Center so most of the restaurants were pretty crowded. They told us a table of two would be about 10-15 minute wait so we put our name in. As my cheeks hit the bench to wait the server called my name and took us to our table. Nice! Prompt seating shorter than the estimated wait, I like it.  We were seated in a two top at the back of the restaurant directly behind a server station, cleverly disguised behind two plants that offered as much privacy as a fish bowl. We had a clear view of our male server grabbing his girlfriend servers butt every time they crossed paths. Cute.  I ordered a Bud Light draft which was about 14.5oz of the 16oz glass it was served in. $3.75. My boyfriend ordered The Works pizza. It was about a 10""-12"" pizza on the relatively thin crust with light sauce and a sprinkling of cheese, sausage, pepperoni, green bell peppers, slivers of onion, olives and mushrooms. All in all it was an ""OK"" pizza but I was very disappointed to find that the mushrooms had the quality and taste of canned produce. For the prices at this place you can't offer fresh fungi?  Check came and luckily I was wearing my work uniform so they gave me a 20% discount, which equated to a free soda. Wooo! I was pleased to see they offer fund-raising nights which donates 20% of the check to your cause if a flyer is presented.

Stella K.,"Irvine, CA",38,102,29,1.0,3/27/2009,"Ahem, please prepare for a long rant ahead... I have visited this location about 4 times since it has opened. Out of the 4, 1 was disappointing and the other made me a little angry. The first time I was disappointed was when my church friends and I visited for dinner. The sun was setting and it was shining into the restaurant. The host wanted to sit us directly in the sunlight which I did not want therefore I asked her to sit us somewhere else. She hesitated and acted like she almost did not want to see us anywhere except in the direct sunlight which baffled me because the restaurant was wide open. After some thought she moved us out of the sunlight, dispairingly. Now this most recent experience, last Friday night to be exact, was a little more upsetting. My sister decided to have her rehearsal dinner at this location because it was down the street from our church in addition to the fact that everyone likes CPK. She made reservations for our group at 7 p.m. Well the wedding rehearsal ran a little late so we called them and asked to push back our reservation to 7:30 p.m. which they said was fine. Again there were some delays so we called CPK again and apologized and inquired if we could push our reservation back to 8 p.m. which they said was fine. Our party arrived a little before 8 p.m. only to find out that they had moved our reservation outdoors onto the patio when we had reservations for inside the dining room. It was freezing cold Friday night but what got us was the fact that they decided, on their own, to move our party outside. I understand that they got busy but they did not give us any notice, not in the two times that we phoned them. Maybe if they would have informed us we would have been prepared and understanding but at that moment and time, all of us were not happy about it. That manager just gave us some excuses and informed us, yea they could have called us with an attitude of (but its too late so what are we suppose to do). The hostess was more professional then the manager of the restaurant. They ended up seating us separately. The attitude of the manager was very unapologetic and unprofessional. She did not even come to apologize to our party and just seemed to want to get us away from the front area of the restaurant.

Well at 1 hour 5 mins the manger brought our food. Still waiting for my tea refill from 25 mins ago. Food at least looks good. My wifes spaghetti bolognese with sauce has a ton of pasta and a tiny amount of sauce...tiny. I ordered the jambalaya fettucini. Its very tasty overall. I just do not like tails on shimp in pasta. We also shared a hand tossed pepperoni mushroom sausage pizza. The crust is outstanding. It should be called two handfuls of mushrooms a couple pepperonis and 3 sausage chunks pizza. . Great crust. We will be taking the red velvet cake home. Well maybe. It was forgoten it seems. So reordering that. Now it seems the coupon was not used the waitress is confused and here we wait on the manager once again. So no. Cake and overcharged about $20. So far... well on my 4th receipt. All were wrong. Now up at the take out with manager tring to fix the ticket and add the missing red velvet cake to the bill. Who knows we might actually get it sometime tonight to take home. A complete waste of 1 hour 30 mins. Still waiting for the bill and cake. Got bill now can not pay the stupid thing. Screw the cake take the money so I can leave this........................finally was able to pay the bill revised by the manager for the 6th time. I paid cash and I guess the waitress assumed the change was her tip since she never came back with my change. I was gojng for no tip but she decieded to keep the $2 and change so be it. After asking 3 other people not my waitress or the manager who went into hiding I got the cake that was partially melted. From walk in the door and seated to finally forcing them to let me pay so I could leave to 1 hour 53 minutes. Should have taken 25-30 mins max. Will never eat there or at any of the chains ever again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-anaheim-2?start=240
Michelle M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",99,139,16,4.0,6/19/2011,"first off i would always get my bread toasted but all of a sudden they tell me they cant because it slows down the time it takes them to make their pizzas? i call BS. Â but whatevers.. they are just too lazy to do it.. thats just what i think.. other then that i like this location a lot. Â i like to go right when they open to avoid any crazy waits or it being busy since they do get a lot of tourist and business people here. Â  i love their salads! the chinese one, thai, cobb, and bbq chicken ones are my favorite.. im always battling and debating which one i should get! Â prices are high for what you get. thats for sure. but i only go once in awhile so its ok.. lol service is good.. sometimes it is lacking and they hide in the back or something.. kind of lame especially when you are trying to get their attention and they are no where to be seen.. annoying.. other then that great place for lunch or dinner! good service. and VALIDATE THAT PARKING TICKET!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-anaheim-2?start=240

At first, we thought that the sangria wouldn't be such a great idea for brunch ... but it went perfect with our meal! I haaave to learn how they do the vanilla bean cream cheese frosting for the red velvet cake. It was really nice inside and our server was very professional. He suggested his favorite items for each section of the menu & refilled my bf's water as soon as he finished it.

Gabriel M.,"Garden Grove, CA",14,21,1,4.0,4/29/2009,"My wife and I are regulars to this location, so it's only fitting that I put in a review for the locals. The restaurant is next to Disneyland and as such tends to attract many, many tourists. Â This is why there is usually a wait and most of the people waiting look like they are from the Midwest. That's the main reason we bypass everyone and sit in our usual spot at the bar. Â The bar staff are friendly, funny and extremely fast when it comes to providing drinks and the food. Â I also found that bar staff tend to be the most honest when it comes to dish opinions and meal suggestions. This location in particular, is great for locals because after seeing tourists come in from opening to close, they tend to treat locals a little bit nicer. Â Go, if you are in the area.

Kaela H.,"Orange, CA",27,147,28,2.0,3/15/2009,"I really love CPK. I do. I can't help it...but this location was a disappointment. I called in my order to go, ""2 carne asada pizzas, table bread, and an OBSCENE amount of ranch, Please"" the girl on the line giggled and said ""Ok, it'll be ready in about 15-20"" My boyfriend went and picked it up and brought it back and when we got ready to eat, we realized, no bread, and about the equivalent to 4 tablespoons of ranch. (It's TO DIE FOR, if you've never had it. It isn't a thick sweet ranch, it's got a TON of herbs and flavors to it. - You'll thank me) Oh, and our food was cold. I just LOVE microwaving my food. Not only did they forget 2 out of 4 things I ordered, it took about THIRTY minutes for the order to be ready.  I guessssss next time, I'll have to do the pick up and inspect every item before I bring it home.

Kathy L.,"Portland, OR",179,290,394,3.0,5/21/2016,"After a morning of being at the Dental Convention, we thought we deserved a beer and some pizza! Â It was about 12:30 on a Friday and it was pretty empty for lunch I had the lunch special and choose the half salad and pizza- I asked if they had gluten free crust and she mentioned that they only have gluten free for the regular size, not the lunch size which is probably the personal size. When I think of CPK, BBQ chix pizza is the thing that pops to mind. Â People always talk about it yet all these times I've been, I've never tried it BUT today was the day for that to change! Â There was a good amount of Caesar salad although I was given barely any dressing. It was enough to coat the top portion of it and I was too lazy to ask for more because I wanted to dig into my BBQ chix pizza. Â It was pretty darn good- crust was thin and yet fluffy at the same time? if that makes any sense- it had just the right sweetness from the BBQ sauce but not overwhelming.

The server was nice but the service was severely lacking. It took awhile before the server came to take our order. When one of the girls in our group was going to order a veggie soup, he straight up told her to not get that because it tastes disgusting. He recommended a different soup instead. I ordered a Thai Chicken pizza with no peanuts on top (I'm not allergic but just don't like peanuts). Even though I specifically requested no peanuts on top of the pizza, when my order came out...there were peanuts on my pizza.... Throughout the entire time when we were eating, he never once came by to refill our waters. The only time he asked if we wanted water was when he gave us our check.

Well portioned and fresh. We both enjoyed that. The pizza was thin crust. My wife loves this pizza; I thought it was kinda bland. With that being said I did eat two pieces. I would prefer a more traditional pizza. The service was solid, restaurant was clean. For a chain restaurant this is a safe choice, post DLand it's a great choice.

I had the chicken strips and my boyfriend had a few slices of pizza. Of course, no dinner is complete without a beer so I had one at Dinner.

Noelle C.,"Fullerton, CA",141,10,16,3.0,12/28/2016,"I'm not sure if this review could be applied to all CPK's nowadays or just this location. But after visiting here, I wondered if the food quality at CPK's have lowered drastically over the years--or if this location just doesn't feel the need to put effort into their food, because they know people will inevitably stop by due to Disneyland.  Me and my sister shared a Bolognese using Fusili pasta with added mushrooms. It was our favorite dish growing up because of the meaty sauce with cheese. For years we would go every week or so with our family and order that exact dish off of the kids menu. (You would think we would've thought to try the pizza first.)  We were excited to order it again after such a long time, but the dish we got was a disappointing shadow of the one we remembered. There was barely any meat in the sauce, and even less cheese. The only thing done right was the pasta itself--cooked al dente. Well done, California Pizza Kitchen, well done... My sister thought it was her cold preventing her from tasting much flavor, but after trying some salt she confirmed it was just the blandness of the Bolognese. She felt like she could've made the dish she had gotten at home. Knowing her, I knew she could've made something better. The only reason why this review isn't sporting two stars instead of three is because the quality of other dishes we got (Thai Crunch salad, BBQ Chicken Pizza, some-lemon-Chicken-dish-I-forgot, and chocolate soufflÃ© a la mode) were not bad Tldr; we paid $15-16 dollars for a mediocre dish--there seem to be some fair choices on the menu, but choose wisely.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-anaheim-2?start=20

Bonnie C.,"Surrey, Canada",200,112,181,5.0,5/5/2016,"We came here for dinner on a Saturday night with a group of 9 and were seated under five minutes. Not sure if that was a miracle, or they're just really well staffed and have tons of space for large parties. A number of individuals in our party had allergies towards onion and garlic and our server, Joseph, checked with the kitchen to see what could be done to accommodate. We ended up ordering five pizzas, two of the wild mushrooms, one of the California veggie, one of the tostasa, and one of the artichoke spinach. Everything was absolutely delicious! Ambiance for the location is comfortably lit, great for family and groups of friends. It was a bit loud at times, but that's to be expected. Free bread is provided throughout the meal, so if you're hungry and having a hard time deciding, munch on that in the meantime. Not many of us ordered drinks, but those who did said they enjoyed it.
