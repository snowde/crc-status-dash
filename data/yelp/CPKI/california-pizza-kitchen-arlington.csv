Jennie K.,"Washington, DC",97,263,459,4.0,11/27/2017,"I don't know what it is, but this CPK has beat every chain that I've been to in CALIFORNIA. The servers are really friendly and easy to talk to, the food comes out spectacular every time, and I also have the greatest company and talks whenever I'm here. I love the pesto pasta, and the California Club pizza. The eggrolls are also amazing, and I can't get enough of the pink ranch sauce that it comes with. MMMM, so good.  Also, I don't go out drinking at restaurants very often, but they have this strawberry/honey sangria that is just out of this world - it's dangerous though, because you can't taste the alcohol. It is absolutely delicious, and I'd recommend it every time (especially if you don't like the TASTE of alcohol). I am definitely coming back here. It's my favorite place to go after shopping around at Fashion Center.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington
Long S.,"Arlington, VA",0,41,,1.0,10/11/2017,"I really wish I could give ZERO stars!!! This CPK is well below the usual not so great corporate CPK standard! Food quality is well below the typical not so great CPK corporate standard. And don't even get me started on service! For some reason, the less than clever manager has the bartender not only tending bar and providing food service for the bar customers, but also taking drink and food orders, as well as, running food to tables in the dining area!!! What?!?!?! How STUPID is that??? Question:  how long should it take for chicken fettuccine in a half-full restaurant? 10 minutes? NOPE!! 15 minutes? YEAH RIGHT, that would be like light speed for this CPK!! 20 minutes? NO WAY!! 25 minutes?? I can't tell you because I walked out after 20 minutes and no food in sight!! Conclusion - DO NOT EAT at this CPK!! Find another restaurant in the area, you have lots of choices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington
Chad H.,"Arlington, VA",139,304,601,4.0,10/7/2017,"I know it's a chain restaurant, but they have a pretty good lunch special. Between $9 to $11, you get a combination of 2 items, whether that be pizza, soup, salad, or sandwich. I had the Sedona Tortilla soup which has tomatoes, mild green chilies, spices, and crispy tortillas. It has a little bit of a zip to it, but still found it to be flavorful and not overwhelming. I also had the super spinach & quinoa salad with grilled chicken. There were granny smith apples, marinated cranberries, spiced pecan, and a champagne vinaigrette. It was the right combination of ingredients and enjoyable. Felt like a healthy meal and I was feeling good afterwords.  Service was everything I hoped it would be. Our waitress checked up on us several times, brought over the food in a timely fashion, and refilled my water on a consistent basis. This is a good place to go to with the family. I wouldn't take a date here, but definitely a solid lunch option in the Pentagon City neighborhood.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington

Candyce B.,"Charlotte, NC",320,767,878,3.0,1/3/2017,"I came here for lunch. The place wasn't packed and we were seated right away.  Our server was prompt and courteous. He gave us a few minutes to go over the menu and then took our order. I ordered the Basil Pesto Pasta with chicken and shrimp. The food arrived quickly but I was a bit disappointed with the ratio of chicken and shrimp to the pasta. I found myself searching for the chicken and finding only pasta.  On a more positive note the flavors were there but since you pay extra to add meat I expected to well you know...see and taste the meat. Meh, it was an experience for sure. If I'm in the area I'd definitely come again and maybe try another signature dish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington
Desiree D.,"Washington, DC",129,223,138,4.0,11/18/2016,"I had been here for a few Happy Hours (drinks only) and ordered delivery once, however I had not fully dined at  CPK until Veteran's Day this year. As a Veteran, I heard they were participating in providing a free entrée for Vets, so my BF and a friend decided to stop by. I was very impressed that they had the Fallen Comrade Table set up in the entrance to honor the fallen, missing, or imprisoned military service-members. Honestly, this speaks highly of the establishment and I plan to dine here more often in the future. When we arrived, we were seated right away. We had Brenda as our server and she was friendly and attentive. For the appetizer we order the Avocado Club Egg Rolls which were phenomenal and perfectly fried. Even my not-easily-impressed BF said that he is going to order these every time we come. For the entrees, we ordered The Original BBQ Chicken and Five Cheese Fresh Tomato Pizza. They were both delicious and a lot bigger than I expected. My friend ordered the Thai Crunch salad, and it looked and tasted amazing. It was seriously the most delicious looking salad I had ever seen. Next time I am definitely ordering one. For the cocktail I had the Beehive Sangria. It was tasty and very refreshing. It did take us a while to get our check (due to CC machine issues) but otherwise a great dining experience. I will definitely be back :).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington

Mindy D.,"Washington, DC",332,642,604,1.0,12/21/2016,"CPK is one chain I actually go to and enjoy, but why oh why do they always have such terrible service? Tonight was no different at Pentagon City CPK and probably one of the slowest service I've ever experienced. Our server, Dylan, was so forgetful or just plain bad at his job, it was ridiculous. He brings water glasses filled to the brim, but no straws. 20 minutes later he brings the lemonade and still no bread. Understandably, the kitchen was backed up due to a large party, but all we wanted were drinks and bread. Parties that arrived after us seemed to get everything before us.  When you have to ask 5 times for bread, something's gotta be wrong. It took close to 40 minutes before we were served just bread and olive oil. The entrees came much later. He was so SLOW. It honestly wasn't that crowded on a Monday night, as there were plenty of empty tables, minus the one large party. I'm not sure what the hold up was, but the service was horrific from beginning to end. We were cutting it close in time and needed a box for the pizza. When we asked another server who happened to walk by our table, she straight out refused to help us. She could have at least acknowledge our request, but instead she rudely dismissed us with a rude stare and asked who our server was. She waited until our server was in sight and directed him towards us instead. Really, you couldn't just give us a box? Is it that difficult?  I did forget my credit card after paying, and our server was nice enough to run after us to return the card. I appreciated that, but unfortunately it didn't help to mend the terrible experience I just had.  Lesson learned. Take out it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington
Rae M.,"Bowie, MD",340,377,524,2.0,10/14/2016,"I've never been a fan of California Pizza Kitchen, which is why I usually stir clear from it. I hadn't been in years and I was recently reminded why I stayed away for so long.  Alas, I found myself dinning here (not by choice) for a work meeting. I'm a firm believer that when you visit an establishment and they specialize in a specific food, you should order it, hence the reason I ordered a pizza. All the pizzas are personal size, so I ordered the pepperoni, sausage and mushroom pizza. The pizza was just okay.  The sauce was bland, the crust was unmemorable and the pizza as a whole just seemed to be missing something....flavor, yeah...that's it. The service was pretty good, and our server was attentive, but nothing really stood out to me.  What's funny is, I've purchased California Pizza Kitchen frozen pizzas from the grocery store and those seem to have more flavor in them, than the pizza I ordered that night.  Oh well...on another note, we did get a lot of work accomplished.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington
Renon G.,"Alexandria, VA",58,146,33,3.0,11/21/2016,"Waiters and staff who constantly ""check up"" on you to see if everything is ok sends two messages to guests.  One; you're trying to get a good tip.  Two; you're not trained well in the art of waiting.  It's extremely annoying to have wait staff constantly do this. And that needs to change about this place. Maybe some people don't mind constantly being interrupted while you're talking to a friend who's sitting across from you but I don't. Once around the beginning when you've began eating your meal and once after the check is given. Let your guests do their thing. Let them have a conversation, it otherwise completely defeats the purpose of having a friend with you to eat at an establishment.  The food... Well its basic Italian, and it's ok.

Michelle K.,"Washington, DC",13,35,5,1.0,12/27/2016,"I'm so very disappointed. I've been here a million times but am unsure if I'll ever come back. What's happened to this place? It's not very busy here right now and I'm here. Party of one. I just came for a cheese pizza and ginger ale- I'm easy.  The hostess was clearly angry that people on her mic weren't answering her on where to seat me. After a few minutes of this, she sat me. After people being served all around me, I finally after 5 minutes went back to the hostess to ask who my waitress was. The hostess took my order. Several minutes later a waitress came, did not apologiZe or even say who she was, and handed me a ginger ale. She never checked on me again. She handed me a pizza- no longer hot- without a word, and I didn't get a chance to ask her to refill my completely empty ginger ale. It took me a few minutes to flag her down after that and I asked. Please keep in mind that I've been nothing if not pleasant to her. But then before getting my drink she loudly started complaining to another waitress about the hostess overbooking her section. She's continued to stand there now for 20 minutes talking to other waitresses and I've yet been asked how I'm doing or if I need anything. I'm not sure how I'll get the check.  I waited to post the review so I could add the name of the waitress: SABRINA. She did finally come over and ask if I wanted a box.  Super disappointed.

I guess there was a typo on the menu, because what they brought was more like a quesadilla molecule. My high school chemistry is a little rusty at this point, so I don't know exactly how much a mole is any more - is it about 6.02 x 10 to the 27th?

Ashley G.,"Washington, DC",287,200,75,4.0,7/4/2016,"I've been eating at CPK since I could eat. I'm not sure if it's always been on the east coast but as a CA native, it was always within a 15-minute drive. I have seen it develop and essentially re-brand over the years. I remember the days with their bright yellow menus, when they would bring out sliced bread with butter and I would order ""corkscrew"" pasta with butter or a traditional cheese pizza for dinner. Now, they bring out bread with olive oil and I order things like mahi mahi tacos (which are quite delicious!). The menu and decor have evolved over the years, and while I wouldn't call it an upscale restaurant, it's more upscale than it used to be. I don't mind the changes but I can sometimes be nostalgic for the past. One thing I really love about this location is the photos on the wall. They have stunning metal photo prints of California and Washington, DC landmarks. They probably do this at other locations, switching out the DC photos for whatever locale in which the restaurant is located, but I think it's a super nice touch.  The pizza and pasta remain delicious. I don't often stray from what I know but everytime I have (like with the mahi mahi tacos referenced above) it's been a good decision. This restaurant will always be a staple to me, no matter where it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington?start=20

Tessie E.,"Arlington, VA",288,92,192,1.0,8/2/2015,"I really wanted to like this place. My boyfriend took me here for the first time, raving about how good the pizza was when he was a kid (and he is a pizza snob.) Yet, service was awful, didn't get a water refill until we were paying our bill, the server argued with us about a coupon we had, initially rejecting it because it was expired, until I found proof it was still valid, at which she rolled her eyes and stalked off with my phone.  During the long stretches of waiting for our food, we saw the place wasn't even that crowded, it appeared a lot of chit chat was going on between servers. When our pizzas came out, they looked very pretty. Asthetically speaking that is. Mine was mushroom and white, his was five cheese and pepperoni. They were borderline COLD. Like they had been sitting out on the counter for 15 minutes before being brought to us (speculation) and the mac and cheese balls brought out 15 min later were the same. Cold. The waitress did not check on us and only asked how the food was when she brought out the mac and cheese balls.  Upon this experience, wouldn't return.

Tiffany Taish D.,"Alexandria, VA",1,20,2,3.0,3/6/2017,"So I frequent this place a lot. The service is never really that great but I enjoy the food tremendously. I placed a Togo order today, and I assume the managers were having their manager meeting (I'm in the restaurant industry so I know a manager meeting and the terms used in one) and I hear one of the managers say ""that's because bitch's talk too much"" Not really an appropriate thing to say around/in front of guest.  Aside from that, I go to pay for my Togo order and I leave the cashier a $6 tip on a $30 Togo order and he never said ""thank you"" Again, I work in the industry and know that most people don't even tip on Togo orders.

Ryan Z.,"Washington, DC",63,590,8,2.0,11/23/2014,"20 years ago, California Pizza Kitchen was the best, but nowadays, something just tastes different. It's hard to pinpoint what's changed, but overall eating here has a very ""corporate"" taste that doesn't strike me as particularly fresh or flavorful. There's an open kitchen, but either this was the quietest kitchen ever, or there wasn't a ton of cooking going on, leading me to wonder if a lot of what they serve arrives pre-cooked. Hmmmm.  My pizza was perfectly edible, but perfectly blah. Plus, the pizzas are pretty small for being almost $14. I wanted to try some appetizers, but they were sent back because they arrived after our pizzas, a full 45 minutes after arriving and when other people around us, who were seated after us, were getting their checks and leftovers packaged up. Service was really lacking, from the no-greeting hostess who seemed totally stressed out, to our well-meaning but frazzled waiter who admitted it was his first day and that he ""wasn't mean't to serve.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington?start=20

What I love about CPK is their extensive menu (pizza, pasta, soup, salad, entrees, tacos, desserts, etc) and their unique topping creations.

Mary R.,"Fairbanks, AK",58,25,7,1.0,10/12/2015,"Although the customer service at the take out window was great, and they had just had an exceptionally large group of teenagers in the restaurant before I arrived to pickup my order, the experience I had with the food at this location can't be attributed to any of those factors  I ordered chicken wraps, a garlic chicken pizza and a piece of key lime pie to take back to my hotel, which was literally five minutes away. The weather was fair, so I'm positive the walk had nothing to do with the food quality either.  The meat for the lettuce wraps was hot and tasty and about what you'd expect for a dish like this. The top leaf of lettuce for the wraps was crisp and green, however, every leaf below was brown and beginning to wilt. It made the dish very unappetizing, and I ended up throwing the lettuce away and eating the meat on its own.  The pizza was extremely cold and scarce on toppings. I believe I counted four scraps of chicken on the pizza as a whole, and it was as cold as might have been expected if I had left it out on the counter for an hour or more prior to eating it. Yet, it was the pizza that was supposedly holding up my order and forcing me to wait 15 minutes longer than the time I was told the order could be picked up when I made it online.  The one saving grace to the meal was the key lime pie, which is one of my favorites. The cream for the topping of it was fresh, and the pie itself was light and not overly sweet. It was the one meal item that I did throughly enjoy and felt lived up to the menu's description.  I travel to DC regularly and am unsure if I'll give this California Pizza Kitchen another shot. It's a chain I've never been hesitant to dine at before, but if I'm going to spend $32 on a meal, I'd like to at least feel like I'm getting my money's worth. I definitely can't say that was the case this time around.  Again, I want to stress that the customer service and attitude of the gentleman working at the take out counter was fantastic, and I didn't actually feel slighted as a customer until I went to eat my dinner. That being said, great customer service and great food should go hand-in-hand at a restaurant.

I can't help but comment, however, that it's strange that it seemed that whoever does the hiring here is only interested in hiring an army of young, in shape, and very attractive people, check and see for yourself, it's odd but not necessarily a complaint.          The atmosphere was, again, highly corporate. You could tell that the decorations were there to match every other location as all chain restaurants do and therefore not offer to the local community something new, vibrant, and unique.           To conclude, I do not plan on returning.

Thankfully we didn't have to wait for a table and were immediately seated.  We ordered mojitos, spinach dip, the tortilla soup and a pear and gorgonzola pizza. Our mojitos, dip, and soup came in a timely manner. The drinks were good as was the dip. The tortilla soup however was a little gross. It tasted like heated enchilada sauce with a mound of melted cheese. Probably will never get that again, but what do you expect when you're ordering soup from a chain restaurant? We had to wait for a very long time for our pizza. People that came in after us got theirs first. The kitchen might have forgotten about our order. The waitress made up for it with her kindness though. She seemed sincerely sorry that we had to wait and kept checking in on us to make sure we were okay.  When the pizza finally did come it was yummy as always. When it came time to pay we were pleasantly surprised by  the waitress when she informed us that the manager took care of the pizza for us because we had to wait for such a long time. We didn't even ask for this, we generally understand that people make mistakes. Lessons learned are to stick to pizza when going to a pizza place and that you can still get great and attentive service even at a busy chain.

Our waiter was on top of his game.  He gave us a lot of information about the vegetarian pizza, as well as, spinach artichoke dip that he recommended as an appetizer.  We could tell right away that he had been working there a while.  Our drinks were refilled fast, our table was wiped and cleaned ahead of time, and the food came out right on time.  Everyone who helped us was very friendly and conscientious.  I think it's a great place to eat and the location can't be beat!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington?start=80

David H.,"Falls Church, VA",324,1219,1897,3.0,10/3/2010,"I had the BBQ chicken and bacon pizza. It is pretty good, has BBQ sauce as the ""pizza sauce"" and has chicken, bacon and onion as the toppings. It's around $13.00 or so for a pizza which is either an individual or two can share depending on your appetite. Good pizza and not very greasy.  We went around 6pm on a Friday and it was crowded but there was no wait. The service was good but a little odd. I think the waiter must have been trained specifically to ask us if we wanted any appetizers on three different occasions (I don't want one and will let you know if I change my mind after the first time you ask). Similar story with the dessert menu where the waiter awkwardly set the dessert menu down on the table at the end of our meal and said ""I'll give you a few mins to look this over"" even after we both had said we weren't interested. He came back a few mins later to ask us what we wanted for dessert. Only after saying no again were we able to get the bill and leave. CPK, enough with the freaking upsell attempts, I want something I will order it!

Unfortunately my waiter had to deal with multiple special requests from neighboring tables and this meant less than great service for me. He forgot a straw for my drink and the bread and olive oil.  Refills were almost too slow. And yes you will want all of these ""services""..  I ordered the Jerk Chicken pizza. It has a thin crisp crust. The center was a bit soggy and the pizza is very sweet. So if you select this pizza, dessert will not be necessary. This pizza was listed as a restaurant favorite, so I had high expectations. When the chicken is rubbery, I am not inclined to believe them. The mediocre food and service result in three stars.

Gabrielle M.,"Derwood, MD",60,20,94,4.0,12/22/2010,"Recently I tried CPK's Chicken Tequila Fettuccine. I had considered ordering the garlic cream fettuccine, but the server enthusiastically recommended this dish so it seemed worth a try. I ordered mine without the red onions or cilantro as the dish calls for because I'm not a fan of either... WOW, this was some really tasty pasta! The recipe melds together beautifully to create a colorful burst of flavor in every bite. I feel I can safely recommend this dish with as much enthusiasm as my server did :) I also highly recommend the Original BBQ Chicken Chopped salad. Ordering a half-size is a great option, as the portion-size that they give you is still quite substantial. My colleague swears by their Original BBQ Chicken pizza. I've had their pepperoni, and the moderately thick pizza crust is a nice balance of chewy and crispy. I would rate this CPK restaurant 5 stars based on the food alone, but the service could definitely be a little better. Sometimes they are quite prompt, but other times you're left waiting for a little while, or you have to ask again for that bread or drink that was forgotten.

I've never had trouble with their service - they're usually pretty quick at all times of day. I've been here for lunch and dinner AND when the masses are at bay - the waiters and waitresses pretty much have the place under control.

Josh S.,"Fairfax, VA",83,173,57,2.0,8/28/2010,"Apparently this is a chain restaurant across the nation and I never heard of this until I moved to Arlington. I didn't have any foods at home and was too lazy to go food shopping and prepare foods, so I asked a friend to go with me to this place because I didn't want to go 23rd St. for bad foods. We got there around 5PM on weekend. It wasn't crowded at all, we were quickly seated. First thing I noticed, out of all empty tables we walked across, they seated us on table where they just had other customers and didn't clean the table cleanly. There were some foods on table and condiment drops which I cleaned myself. Not cool at all. The waiter came about few minutes later. He wasn't very enthusiastic. He didn't really greet us - just handed the menu and asked us what we'd like for drinks. I wanted lemonade and they had multiple choices. He did recommend the best lemonade (Strawberry) which I thought was strawberry flavored Kool-Aid. Too sweet for me. I should've just gone with Diet Coke. My friend and I ordered this Korean BBQ Taco for appetizer. Now, I'm born and raised Korean boy who is now American citizen and lived in the States for 10+ years. But I still know what Korean foods taste like. This appetizer comes as two soft-tortilla taco. I guess it's perfect to share with your date, but way too small to be considered as appetizer. They actually call it 'small craving' which is smaller version of appetizer I guess. Nonetheless, the meat had some Korean BBQ flavor, but the food in general didn't taste anything like Korean foods. It actually tasted more like Thai foods (no offense). Just my two cent and again, I am a Korean. So I think I know a thing or two about my country's foods. The actual meal. The pizzas. They were great. My friend and I ordered only one thinking we'd share the pizza. The waitor gave us a look of 'really? that's all you're gonna order?"" to us - which made me think that pizzas are small size. At this point, I refused to believe the pictures on the menu or the wall because the Korean BBQ taco was 4 times smaller than what picture had. We ended up getting BBQ Chicken Pizza w/ Bacon. The pizza is somewhat of middle size pizza you'd get from Papa Johns. It was perfect for my friend (girl) and I to share because I don't eat a lot of foods and she's a girl. We finished our meal with fullness. However, I do believe if two dudes go to this restaurant, they'd need to order one for each. The taste? I thought it was alright, nothing spectacular. I think local pizzeria can match it or even top this place. I definitely had better pizza elsewhere - most notably from New York. The waiter was probably in hurry. He gave us check way before we finished our foods. I thought this was very rude because we were trying to enjoy our meal but the check just ruins it. Again, just no enthusiasm from him what so ever. It would've been better if we had better server because he was not happy working there. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place unless you're really craving some cheap pizza for yourself. They do have lots of different choices for pizza and I'm sure they're all pretty tasty. For me, I'd only come back to this place because I live close by and lazy to go in to city for better pizza (ie. Matchbox). Definitely more of family dining place than take-your-date restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington?start=160

Helen S.,"Salem, MA",0,9,,1.0,4/19/2010,"The service here is an absolute joke. Single white females traveling alone on business are apparently invisible.  I showed up last Thursday afternoon, a little after 6:30. I was staying at the hotel across the street from this location, and was interested in getting an early dinner and a cocktail, without dealing with the scene in the hotel lounge or paying the ridiculous mark-up for room service. I was still wearing my suit, though I had switched out my heels for walking shoes. Not that this is the Ritz, but I was looking neat and orderly.  No one was waiting when I entered, and there were several empty tables on the floor, at least five spots at the bar, and only two couples on the patio. Regardless, I made a point of asking the hostess if they were too busy for a single diner. She just sighed, disgusted, and asked where I wanted to sit. I agreeably said anywhere was fine. She plopped my menu on a table close to the door and marched off, never to be seen again.  I waited for 30+ minutes. No one ever even offered me a glass of water. I tried to make eye contact with every server that went by, but they studiously looked down. Three staffers (one turned out to be the MANAGER!) were laughing and carrying on by the kitchen door.  When I finally demanded to speak to the manager, she was more upset by my angry tone than with the abject FAILURE of her staff to provide service to a customer. She said that the servers were ""on break"" and if I wanted to be served, I could ask for take-away. I pointed out that I had been waiting half an hour, and that if paying customers were waiting, then no one should be ""on break."" I added that in that time, several men (at the bar) and a family of four (on the floor) had all been seated and were now eating.  ""What do you want me to do?"" she sneered.

Tamra B.,"Stanford, CA",8,4,,4.0,12/5/2011,"With a couple of young kids in tow, even hard core foodies (aka snobs) start to look for different things in frequented restaurants.  We still expect to eat well and value solid service, but things like an ample kids menus and comfy booths, where you shouldn't get dirty looks if your toddler gets out of hand, might trump valrhona chocolate desserts. My family has been frequenting CPK in Arlington, VA now for about 4 years.  Compared to other CPKs that we have visited, I would rate this one highly.  The food is consistent, the service is great and it's a very clean establishment. My kids love CPK.  They have an excellent kids menu both in that there are lots of fun activities (it's a book) in it, and they have a huge selection.  Mom likes it too since they have healthy sides like fresh fruit and vegetables. If you are new to CPK and wondering if you should go, because maybe you are not in the mood for pizza, I'll tell you that I am mainly drawn to the array of salads, which are very good.  Do not miss the Tri-Colore ""Salad"" which is listed with the pizzas.  This is, in my opinion, the best dish on the menu.  Simple, yet perfect blend of greens, sweet tomato bites and a nice pungent grana parmesan tossed in homemade Dijon balsamic vinaigrette. I also often order the Four-Cheese Raviolis with Mushrooms which are pretty good, but I do think it was better a couple of years ago (although that could be because I was pregnant then and was having cravings for this dish).  Another great dish and odd for a pizza restaurant, are the Fish Tacos.  The fact that the fish is sautéed is a real plus for me since I don't like fish tacos that are prepared with fried fish. We like the selection of small plates and appetizers, but sometimes I am left thinking that we didn't get a good bang for our buck.  For example, I remember ordering the Tuscan Hummus for the table but it was really only enough for maybe 2 people with a couple of spoonfuls of hummus.  They have these really tasty Korean BBQ Steak Tacos  with napa cabbage on the Small Cravings Menu--I wish they had a full sized dinner of these. The desserts are pretty good, but as a chocolate connoisseur, the Chocolate Soufflé Cake was disappointing in that is just doesn't taste like a high quality chocolate.  A decent chocolate layer cake would probably suit CPK better.  We like the Butter Cake which is like a pound cake and the Red Velvet Cake, but skip the Tiramisu, it is unmemorable. As for beverages, for the level of dining that CPK is -- a family restaurant -- the liquor, wine and beer selection is pretty good, but if you are looking for a pre-func Negroni, you may have to teach the bartender how to make it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington?start=140

Meg G.,"Washington, DC",146,450,66,4.0,8/25/2009,"Firstly, the staff here is always nice - much appreciated!!  I would come in and they usually knew that I wanted my bread toasted and would have it ready ahead of time.   NOW, this is a pizza kitchen, and most come for the pizza.  I always have to be different.  I'm more of the Cobb/BBQ salad & peach iced tea kind of lady.  However, my absolute favorite item on the menu is the chicken chowder.  YES, I know, it's the typical Tex-Mex sort of fare; with the corn, tortilla strips and all that.  I have a confession to make - I always order two cups - dinner portion size.  I will eat it morning, noon and night if I want to.  This is one chain that I'm not ashamed to say I love.  The soup, alone, deserves four stars.  Creamy, flavorful and filling - it is.   Super-sweet customer service, and top-notch location does it every time.  So, do I qualify as a CPK groupie?  Methinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington?start=140
Dustin T.,"Menlo Park, CA",76,109,3,4.0,5/14/2012,Love this location.  Servers were great.  New small plates menu is amazing.  Made a meal out of two of them.  It's the perfect end to a great shopping trip to Pentagon City Mall.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington?start=140
Jonathan H.,"San Diego, CA",416,327,1006,3.0,5/8/2009,"Note: The following must be narrated in the voice of Arnold Schwarzenegger for proper effect.  Today my appetite was really gigantic, like a handsome barbarian. All the restaurants in Pentagon City are for sissies. Except CPK. CPK is where I go to save John Connor from the T-1000. Haha. Just kidding. I eat pizza here.  The pizza I ordered is called a jerk chicken pizza. It's not too big, but neither is the California deficit. Haha. Just kidding. The deficit is really gigantic.  I ate here with a girly woman, so I was forced to order soup. If I were by myself this would never have happened. It was the asparagus soup with the croutons. It tasted like a cybernetic poly-alloy. Liquid metal.  After we demolished the food, I planned an ingenious escape through the confusing revolving door to the metro stop right outside. Then we... Get down! Get back to the chopper!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington?start=140
Aisha J.,"Washington, DC",43,22,,5.0,1/19/2010,"First I have to say that before Saturday night, I hadn't been to a California Pizza Kitchen in years. I was still expecting an in & out 'diner' type of feel, but they've seriously upgraded. I had to take the time out to give this particular location a Yelp because our server that night was phenomenal. She knew the menu, the specials and even told us about the new wine menu. (If I knew any better, I would dare to call her a sommelier - after explaining the wine menu, she brought samples to the table and walked us through the tasting and comparing. Seriously, where else does that happen?!) The appetizers were great, but I'd ordered a Carne Asada pizza and wasn't really satisfied with it. It wasn't terrible, but honestly, I was going to pay for it anyway - I didn't think about having it taken back since I'd eaten about 3 slices already. J*, our server, came around to check on us and she asked how I'd liked my meal. I said it was kinda so-so and do you know what she did? She took it off the tab! Color me amazed! Even with the not-so-great pizza I ordered (my fault), I really have to give this CPK 5 stars for the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington?start=180
gene A.,"Alexandria, VA",0,5,,4.0,12/5/2010,"There are many gourmet pizza places in and around Washington and I am sure they all have amazing pizza but my weakness is Margarita Pizza. Whenever I try q new Pizza restaurant I will go for Margarita. For a chain California pizza kitchen makes one extremely thin, crusty and prefect Margarita. Its my ritual  to pick one from day every Friday night. The California pizza kitchen in Arlington is one handful in their chain that still uses wood burning oven and it shows.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington?start=180
Marsha D.,"Alexandria, VA",0,3,,4.0,9/25/2012,"I haven't eaten at this CPK in a while, but it's definitely changed.  The food is still outstanding, but the menu is much smaller, there's not as many waitstaff as I've seen previously, and there's been no wait whatsoever for a table with the two times I've eaten lunch there over the past two weeks.  On previous visits with a party of two or four, I've waited 10-30 minutes for a table to clear.  Another reviewer mentioned about the long wait for your food order.  They are absolutely right, but there's also equally long waits to get waited on and to get your bill paid.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington?start=180
David K.,"Encinitas, CA",170,673,16,2.0,1/25/2009,"This is pseudo-gourmet pizza.  At this point in the life of California Pizza Kitchen, you are just as well off getting one of their frozen pizzas from the grocery store.  CPK is reduced to being nothing more than just ordinary.  For what you pay, you are getting a small pizza, with 8 small slices.  It is about enough for 2 people with moderate appetites.  I think the BBQ chicken pizza is fine, but not great.  The carne asada pizza is also good but not great.  I just think there are better options in the DC area than CPK.  It is a convenient location right next to the Metro, and is ideal for take out on the way home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington?start=180
Maryanne G.,"Arlington, VA",1,51,,3.0,3/9/2012,"Overall, good food, fresh ingredients, very California. Everything could go with a little more spice, or at least some choices on the table (like red pepper flakes, hot sauce) BUT... Considering  the prices...   eg $9 for a glass of Santa Marguerita Pinot Grigio, $15 for a very modest sized Asian Salad - I think it's very pricey, especially since the atmosphere is big chain, and the service is okay... Just okay. The pizza is good, not great. Crust a little too sweet, and we didn't even have the whole wheat crust. I would go again if I was famished and shopping nearby and there was no line. Otherwise, I'd pick another place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington?start=180
Kadian F.,"Orlando, FL",24,142,5,3.0,3/9/2009,"I love the adobe chicken chowder is my favorite item on the menu. The pizza is ok, not a great as you would expect but it's decent. They do have a full bar so that's a plus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington?start=180
Bi N.,"Washington, DC",4,47,,4.0,7/21/2009,"I haven't been herre in a while but I met up with a friend for dinner.  I usually like to get their bbq chicken salad although I was tempted to get pasta.   For some reason, they don't make the one pasta dish that I used to really like....some creamy dish with bacon and peas.  Maybe it was because it was a million calories and an instant heart attack. The waitress was very attentive in the beginning but then she kind of disappeared.  Maybe she felt like she was interupting us.  It wasnt a big deal.  We just wanted boxes to take home our stuff.  The salad was delicious as usual.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington?start=180

Kristen J.,"Arlington, VA",0,16,,4.0,1/12/2009,"Definitely a fan!  I normally don't ever choose to go to a chain restaurant but this is one I crave for quite often.  I always have a little internal battle about whether to order a pizza (I love the shrimp scampi, thai chicken, and pear and gorgonzola (yes I know that doesn't sound like a good pizza, but it is!!!))  or if I should order soup and salad!  I am a big fan of the pea soup and the field green salad (they are giant so a half size has always been sufficient).  The service has never been astounding but it's a dependable place for a tasty lunch or dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-arlington?start=180
