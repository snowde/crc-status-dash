Sunny D.,"Torrance, CA",20,188,,4.0,1/18/2010,"I like the setup of this place. Half sit-down, half fast-food, and little wait. I like the more simplified menu and not having to wait for a waiter to get my order. Sure, I don't get the white table cloths, but I do get my food faster and it tastes just as good as CPK. Still, it remains a little expensive, but I guess that's what you get with the chain restaurants. Seating is good, with some outdoor seating too. The staff does seem a bit overwhelmed at times. I ordered my beloved BBQ Chicken salad and we had a marguerita pizza which was delicious, although a bit on the small side. I would definitely go to this restaurant again should I want to forgo cooking dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-redondo-beach
Lisa S.,"Long Beach, CA",1311,1836,312,1.0,10/19/2009,"The inside is rather nice -- much nice than expected.  They seem to have a few items with which I'm not familiar, but mostly along the lines of soups and salads. We ordered a Sicilian pizza and an oriental chicken salad.  The pizza came out small, and we didn't realize that was the only choice in that option on the menu.  :(  Also, the salad was bad.  PLUS, it took FOREVER for us to get our food and we were hungry.  If they were cooking a full-sized pizza, that'd be one thing.  But it was a mini one, so it should have been faster, no?  :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-redondo-beach
Johnny G.,"Redondo Beach, CA",694,264,2801,3.0,1/24/2009,"Stopped here with wifey during a  bikeride on Saturday afternoon. Had the Buffalo chicken ranch pizza. Yes, seriously. And ... it was GOOD.  Maybe a bit pricey for being pizza, but hey, it's ""California"" pizza,...we'll go back sometime to spend the rest of the gift card we got for Xmas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-redondo-beach
Matt M.,"Logan, UT",98,248,40,4.0,1/5/2010,"I went there with my mother and a family friend. We thought it'd be like any other CPK restaurant, but no, it's more like a ""fastaurant."" You order something at the register first then you sit down and experience the regular restaurant service. That's one difference. Another is they have sizes for pizza. There was the individual and ""family"" sizes. We got the family size. And the third difference id that they don't have my favorite pizza, the white pizza. :-( But we went with some kind a pizza with chicken on the top. I remember we ordered something else together, probably pasta, or salad. The service was terribly slow and the price was a bit outside the friend's comfort zone. However the food was excellent and we had a good, jolly time so there was nothing too distracting for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-redondo-beach
Heather R.,"Redondo Beach, CA",227,246,80,4.0,5/25/2007,"I'm a ""Girl on the Go.""  I rarely have time to stop for a meal.  So, for helping me out, I give CPK ASAP 4 stars.  Why?  Because they have curbside service! I love being able to just call in my order and then drive to CPK and pick up the food without even stepping out of my car.  It makes life so much easier sometimes.  Just grab and go! I also like the menu.  Though they have taken off the pastas, the panini selection is extended from the regular restaurant's offerings.  They also have four choices of fresh made soups and some tasty salads.  Slurp! I should note that while most of the time I'm on the go, there are tables inside which are always clean.  I usually eat on the patio when I've dropped my car off to the car wash next door.  Then I can watch to make sure I'm finished eating before my car is finished being washed. ...Girl on the Go, you know...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-redondo-beach
Judy C.,"Rio Rancho, NM",5,47,29,4.0,10/31/2008,"Food = 4 Stars Service = 2.5 Stars I like the food at CPK but the service is slow, very slow.  It is almost impossible to place a take-out order on the phone, they have you on hold for at least 30 minutes while they are helping the people inside the restaurant first.  Walk in a place your order is my recommendation. Love the BBQ Chicken Pizza hold the cilantro.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-redondo-beach
Beth F.,"Redondo Beach, CA",14,171,16,3.0,1/3/2008,"I can't decide how to rate this restaurant because I am really TRYING to be fair.  I had one really bad experience here a couple months ago but my other visits have been fine.  The menu is way more limited than the full service CPKs and I don't recommend getting a salad to go here because they are prepackaged & not so fresh.  But moving on... I came here with my kids, a friend & her kids one evening.  Now understand my friend is pretty skinny and the bitch needs to eat dammit!  The kids food came out & my food came out but my friend's did not.  We waited about five minutes and finally I went inside (we were sitting on their patio which is nice!) to see what the deal was.  The young guy I spoke to was not apologetic and kind of had an obnoxious tone.  I showed him the receipt & lo and behold I was charged for her meal so he said he would make her another one (WTF happened to the first one?).  Fifteen minutes later her meal arrived and the rest of us had already finished. Funny how one bad experience can jade your whole view on a place...seriously though, haven't had any other bad experiences here but that one sucked, their parking lot leaves alot to be desired and their menu is not so comprehensive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-redondo-beach
Marc B.,"Long Beach, CA",40,38,5,4.0,5/10/2010,"Yup... another CPK master piece, but only right near the beach in Redondo Beach. The great thing about CPK asap is the price is slightly less than the full on restaurant CPK, but with the same atmosphere and a wide food selection. They pretty much take everything good to offer from the mainstream CPK's and compile them in a smaller, more afforable restaurant. The customer service has been good and the location is great. The only thing that separates CPK asap from 5 stars for me is that even though the prices are good, they still could be slightly cheaper. I will return time and time again for the original bbq chicken pizza with applewood bacon....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-redondo-beach
Kelly T.,"Newport Beach, CA",19,85,,4.0,5/2/2007,"This place is perfect for picking up something on the way home from work.  If you call ahead, they'll even take it out to your car. They do not serve pastas here like they do at their other restaurants, which is unfortunate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-redondo-beach
Tosh I.,"Los Angeles, CA",570,806,604,4.0,1/9/2008,"This location seems a little smaller than the other one I used to frequent over at South Bay Galleria.  However, I prefer this location mainly because of the closer proximity to my home.  My favorite is the BBQ chicken salad for the past few years.  After attempting to make this at home based on their cookbook, it's given me a greater appreciation for this dish despite how easy a salad seems to be and I'm not a salad fan either!  The appetizers and entrees are pretty good.  This is a great place with good food despite being a chain.  Check it out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-redondo-beach
Izzy W.,"Redondo Beach, CA",9,129,12,4.0,3/17/2009,A friend of mine took me here and I have to say anywhere I can order a beer with my lunch is perfect for me :) but seriously I ordered a creamy pesto chicken pasta...the pasta was al dente and the pesto was creamy and oh so good.  will def be coming back.....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-redondo-beach
