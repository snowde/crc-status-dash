Haily W.,"Beaverton, OR",79,308,45,4.0,6/9/2009,"Wanted to grab a quick bite to eat before jumping on a plane to head to Disneyland. Grabbed the tuna sandwich to split with the BF out of the cooler. Seriously one of the best tuna sandwich ever! It was the bread that made it so good. Soft onion bread with carmalized onion pieces on top. I was full with the half, but still made myself finish it cause it was so tasty.  Mmmm. The cashier was a b*tch, but that sandwich made it all better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-san-jose
Isabelle K.,"Austin, TX",186,572,452,4.0,6/19/2008,"I was stuck at San Jose airport for 5 hours because I missed my flight. The security line is ridiculous long. The end was in far deep airport parking lot. Can you believe how slow the security line is? Especially there is one Asian security guy who can take at least 5 minutes on each person. He must suspect everyone is a terrorist. Better avoid him next time. Finally reach the gate, they just shut the door. So I decided to explore the airport restaurant options. There are not many choices at all since it's a small airport. I decided to eat at California Pizza Kitchen. It should be authentic since it's called California and I'm in California. I ordered tortilla soup and Thai chicken Pizza. The pizza is really good. I loved it. The best food ever at airport. But the tortilla soup is horrible. It's faster than the regular CPK restaurant because they are all pre-made pizza. They have pizza frozen in the freezer. After customers ordered it, they will move it from the freezer to the oven directly. It doesn't matter to me, it still tastes as good as the restaurant quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-san-jose
Emma F.,"Fremont, CA",1,13,,1.0,12/6/2008,"I might have liked the food if they had ever made my order.  When I followed up since several orders after mine had been called, I found they never made it.  Since I had a flight to catch - imagine - I had to have them cancel the order so I could get something I would have time to eat before my flight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-san-jose
