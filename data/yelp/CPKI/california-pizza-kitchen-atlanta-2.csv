Mary W.,"Jonesboro, GA",26,145,120,3.0,9/24/2017,"It has been a very long time since I dined here. The restaurant is badly in need of some new chairs/tables. My tacos were more cabbage than fish and the fish was dry. The Thai Chicken spring rolls were served hot but gooey in the middle. Not exactly overwhelmed but the food. The service was great though. When using the restroom, the floor was a mess. Mentioned to the  server and it was promptly cared for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=20
Isabel S.,"Atlanta, GA",172,104,1328,4.0,3/23/2017,"I like to come to this CPK specially because when you dine in you can buy movie tickets for just $8.50 instead of $13.50 at the Regal's Box office. They mess up sometimes in the order, but they have great customer service taking care of the mistakes.

Natalia P.,"Atlanta, GA",112,19,20,3.0,4/13/2017,Had a decent experience here--food was fresh and came out quick. The Baja egg rolls were bland. The barley soup was nice and creamy.

Berhane A.,"Atlanta, GA",634,154,1348,4.0,12/26/2016,"I really do love this location. It's right in Atlantic station near Copelands. They have plenty of indoor and outdoor seating (when the weather is nice). I usually always get the same thing every time I come which is the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pizza. My daughter always gets the same thing as well just cheese and pineapples. As for as appraisers I've tried the avocado egg rolls, the lettuce wraps, crispy Mac and cheese, and the buffalo cauliflower. They are all pretty good I keep them in rotation when I go. When I feel like being healthy I'll get the blacked salmon Caesar salad which is really good. They usually have complementary bread w/ olive oil but they were out when I was there 2 days ago. The service is usually pretty good. BUT the last two times I went I did see 1. Two of the cooks about to get into a fight (which was kinda entertaining). & 2. My server was not attentive and really nonchalant which was annoying to me. I don't believe the validate parking but you do get 2 free hours when u get there which is usually plenty of time to eat and go. Or they have street metered parking which is what I usually opt for. It's $3 for 2hrs. Overall 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=20

Andrea M.,"Lawrenceville, GA",531,1117,3672,4.0,8/20/2015,"I'm fairly certain I've eaten here before, but it has been many years before. The bf and I went here to grab dinner with his friend, but we chose this location because of the Improv in the Park that happens every 1st Wed of the month. I think this mostly occurs during the summer so check it out before coming out.  The service here was attentive and great. The food was pretty good; it wasn't super super awesome or divine but merely good. Some of the pizza creation was unique: Thai chicken and the pear gorgonzola. The pizza size here was funky: it is between a personal pan pizza and a medium pizza. I chose the pear gorgonzola (a type of cheese). It had unique ingredients and tasted unique as well. The hazelnut slices (?) atop the pizza gave it an interesting texture as you take the 1st bite. The pear was sweet, and the cheese had a slightly bitter taste. It was sort of like blue cheese.  The bf's Thai pizza was also unique. If you use the dip, it will be super spicy. Without it, it was somewhat plain. There was also a rewards membership that you can sign up for. For every $100, you get a percentage back. Parking is free for the 1st 2 hours and thereafter you're on your own.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=20
Kaila T.,"McDonough, GA",59,48,28,4.0,8/5/2017,"It has been a long time since I came to this location. The surrounding restaurants have definitely changed over the past couple of years. The Copeland's cheesecake restaurant is no longer around, which surprised me. For the purpose of this review, I will get back to the topic at hand. I went to CPK with a friend of mine on a Friday night. Given the time and Day I went, I expected to be a huge crowd. There was a huge crowd and I had to put my name on the list to be called. We were initially told that wait time would be 10 minutes, however we were waiting for about 20 minutes. I was very disappointed I figure it would take them time to clear off the tables. Our waiter was very nice and professional. For an appetizer, I had the spinach artichoke dip  and the five cheese + tomato pizza. The only reason why this review lost a star was because the pizza wasn't as warm as I would have liked it. I still enjoyed coming here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=20

Deborah W.,"Sandy Springs, GA",8,55,8,3.0,10/15/2017,"Being a ex waitress I have high expectations for servers and expect my service to be A1 and that wasn't what we got. My friend had a birthday dinner party of 12 the wait took forever but when we were finally seated I guess the waitress was tired and ready to go because you can see it on her face she was throw down straws didn't speak to non of us I had to look up at her and say ""hello how are you doing today"" for her to even acknowledge us . She then walks away and didn't take our drink orders I had to tell her to order my drink. I know some of the people at our table was extremely loud but that don't have anything to do with her service. She finally took the rest of the drink orders after I got mine and I had to ask to put appetizers in so when she delivered them she didn't ask if we were ready to put in our entrees and half the table got their meal first.

Iva C.,"Atlanta, GA",66,6,4,1.0,3/27/2016,"The worst experience to date!!! At 8 PM I ordered a Thai chicken pizza with a substitute of shrimp instead of chicken ( I DON'T eat CHICKEN) I wrote very specifically in my order instructions....""NO chicken please I only want shrimp on it... I know there is an up charge I will pay for it""... At 9:45 I received a very cold, very shifted pizza with chicken all over it. At that time the restaurant had closed for business... However the delivery service was able to reach someone. They were told they made the pizza exactly as it was supposed to be. And they refused to refund me my  money.  So I was left with a pizza I COULD NOT eat... A hunger headache an empty stomach and no dinner... And a refused refund!!!

Vaughn W.,"Canton, GA",0,2,,1.0,3/12/2017,"Ridiculous experience. Showed up for St Pats celebration.  At 5:00 pm tried to get a table for 7 .  The two patio areas were not in use and I saw a few empty tables inside. Hostess tells us it will be an hour and a half to get a table. We asked to be seated outside. Hostess tells us it is a ""server"" issue (??) and that we can sit outside and wait for a table inside. We go to 2nd patio area and see a table of 4 being waited on. We seated ourselves and watched the server come and go several times to the other table, taking their order and serving food. Tried to get his attention but he would not even make eye contact with us. Finally ordered our food by placing to-go order at the bar. Meanwhile another group was seated and served in our patio area. Same server continued to avoid eye contact and would not acknowledge us Bartenders delivered our food to our table in to-go boxes We hauled our own drinks and silverware Throughout the night all but these three tables remained empty in the patio areas (10-15 tables) Management non-existent.

Kenyatta B.,"Savannah, GA",8,114,261,5.0,10/17/2017,"My boyfriend and friends decided to stop in for dinner before we headed out. Our party started with four people then it grew to five mid-way through the dinner. Our waiter Solomon immediately greeted us upon sitting and met everyone of our needs. We was personable and helpful throughout the entire experience. We ordered two shots, the sangria trio, a beer, the shrimp scampi pizza, and the California club. Our total came up to approximately 70 dollars, which, is a decent price for the amount of food and drinks we ordered. When the fifth member of our party came to the table, Solomon allowed us to pull up a seat and continue on with our dinner with no hesitations. Before we finished dinner we asked for additional bread and olive oil and every item we tried that night was delightful. This was an overall amazing experience. I hope the shrimp scampi pizza stays for a little while longer.  Overall the restaurant deserved an A. This is due to our awesome waiter, great food, family atmosphere, and decent wait time. Pitfalls, the pizza did take a little longer (this could be due to the large dinner crowd) and parking in this area may be confusing due to the numerous shops and eateries in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2

Joy B.,"Atlanta, GA",1,35,33,3.0,6/24/2017,"CPK is a solid consistent experience. It's in a great location. There's a parking garage. So, unless there's a big event, there's usually parking available. There are shops around and a movie theater. So great mix use community.  The restaurant has a nice size bar and plenty of seating for small and larger parties. The decor and atmosphere is relaxing and good for gatherings. The service was good and the restaurant was clean and well-kept. The food here is pretty good. It can sometimes be under seasoned and bland depending on what you order. I ordered the spinach and artichoke dip. It was ok. I wasn't too impressed. I also order a daiquiri. It was not good. But the butter cake is delicious. So moist and buttery. It's one of my favorite menu items there. The service was good and the restaurant was clean and well-kept. The prices are reasonable, but they could work on the quality/taste to match the price more fairly.  I did learn that CPK customers receive 50% off of their movie theater tickets at Regal Atlantic Station.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2
Lauren R.,"Culver City, Los Angeles, CA",66,139,141,1.0,4/7/2017,"Very bad customer service. Subpar food in comparison to the other California Pizza Kitchen's that I have been too. I went to the California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) in Atlantic Station for dinner last night out of convenience. I have been to this location of CPK twice before and have been disappointed in their pizzas and salads both times. However, I was set on getting pizza and didn't want Papa John's or Sarpino's so I went to CPK. Upon entrance, I asked the hostess where the takeout was. After an annoyed sigh, she said ""Over there.. that way.. you see the sign.. in that corner."" As I walked towards to take out sign in the very back corner of the restaurant, I still heard her shouting directions at me as I was walking away. I was shocked! The host/ess is the first impression of a restaurant and for her to be so rude and have such a terrible attitude was appalling. I contemplated turning around and walking out of the restaurant due to the very unfriendly welcome. She was a brunette and I believe her name was Tez.  Luckily I was greeted in a very friendly and welcoming manner by the women at the Take-Out counter. One of their name badges said Alex and I couldn't remember the other's name but she had dreadlocks. They were very nice in stark comparison to the hostess and brought out the manager for me to speak with about my experience while I waited for my food. I shared my experience with the manager and all that she said to me was ""thank you for sharing."" That was it.. No apology, just thank you. She then proceeded to walk over to the hostess and presumably discuss her behavior towards me while I was still in the restaurant! To make matter worse, once I got home about 5 minutes later, my pizza was cold. The cheese tasted very low quality for a CPK and it was just not good. The brownie that I got from there was as hard as a brick and lacked in flavor. I ended up throwing everything away and will not be frequently that California Pizza Kitchen again. Their other locations have much better customer service and great tasting food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2
Bianca G.,"Atlanta, GA",203,63,177,3.0,3/18/2017,"CPK is one of the better places to eat in Atlantic Station, and I've been to this specific location twice now. Once I came here on a date, and then the other time I came here for dinner with my boyfriend and his mom when she came to visit.  Ambiance: Dining inside in a booth provides a nice intimate setting, and the general setup of the restaurant is nice. When there aren't kids around it's a nice place to be for an evening dinner out.  Service: Service is pretty good, although there can sometimes be a long wait just to get in to the restaurant. I tried to come here once with a group of friends on a Friday night and ended up leaving because the wait was 45-60 min.  Food: The California club pizza is delicious! I've also tried two of their soups, the squash and the potato soups, and they were good too. I would recommend going for something a little more hearty though as two-in-a-bowl soups are not very filling.  Overall: If you want to go a sit-down restaurant in Atlantic Station then CPK is a great option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2
Vincent M.,"Atlanta, GA",68,49,232,3.0,9/20/2017,"So I was not as pleased with CPK as I expected to be compared to my experience with the one in Birmingham, AL.  My first experience I had their pasta.  On this visit I decided to do the barbecue pizza off the lunch menu.  You get a soup or a salad with your entree.  I chose the potato soup and to my surprise it was not bad.  You just have to add a little salt! Now I was not impressed with the pizza. My coworkers and I walked about a mile there so I was pretty hungry.  It was not satisfying taste wise. Plus it was barely warm. The crust is not good and it's very thin.  The sauce was okay, nothing special.  Maybe it's because it's lunch but I wasn't impressed overall with the pizza selection. Service was okay. Upon being seated the staff were huddled in the corner looking, so my coworkers and I waited to see how long it would take for someone to come to our table, which was about 6-7min.

She gave us plenty of time to look over the menu & was friendly. We shared the spinach dip as an appetizer and it was hands down the best spinach dip I've had in such a long time.  Their chips are thick and crispy vs the usual thin, oily chips at most places. I ordered the crispy thin margherita pizza! I was surprised how large it was for only being $14. We ate 4 slices and took 3 slices home, it's a pretty good deal.

Tip: do not pay for toppings on the pasta b/c they will jip you. I literally got 4 small balls of chicken (the size of a dime) and 2 thin mushroom particles even though I paid and extra $5 for them. Oh, and don't expect any assistance or customer service efforts from Morgan. She is extremely rude - ignored me when I asked for more napkins. Will never go back. UPDATE: after leaving this review, the cpk social media team reached out to me to address it. but when they put me in touch w/the ""managing partner"" of this location, brandon, he never replied back. now we see why the customer service here is so dismal - it starts at the top.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2

The front of the house staff was warm, friendly and inviting. However, our server was inattentive and aloof. We waited for 15 minutes to be greeted. In fact another server felt pity for us and offered to take our drink order. 5 minutes thereafter our actual server came to ask if we wanted drinks. We informed him that someone beat him to it and he appeared nonchalant. My guest and I requested bread...we're still waiting. The table next to us who were seated roughly 20 minutes after us were greeted promptly with smiles and eagerness. Their drinks arrived promptly and they ordered right away. I definitely don't feel like we received equal service for equal pay. I'm truly disappointed because this is not the service that I have grown accustomed to in my 20+ years patronizing CPK.

It was approximately 30min from our first bread request to find out they were now putting it in the oven. Of course I was almost done with my salad.

Julian R.,"Los Angeles, CA",131,169,84,1.0,4/19/2016,"Absolutely horrible service. The Yelp app for this restaurant had a thing to click that says free small plate when you sign up. I signed up and then the waiter Nick was a total asshole to me about it. Apparently you have to wait for the next visit. That wasn't on the deal on Yelp, but I signed up for the rewards program. The manager stopped by and told me that their system couldn't update fast enough which is why they want it on the second visit. He said he'd run my rewards card and see if it was there, and it was! Win for me. After asking about the rewards thing, the waiter Nick didn't return to the table. The manager had to bring us silverware that he never brought. We never had our drinks refilled. After the app and pizza came to the table, it took about 45 minutes for the free small plate to come. We practically had to wave Nick down to get our bill. He couldn't be bothered to wait on our table anymore. I think in the hour we were there he took the order and dropped off the check. Basically not another word. It was really disappointing that all of this was over a $5 small plate. They shouldn't have the alert on yelp to sign up to get a free small plate if they don't want to honor it. I guess there's no real reason to have signed up for the rewards program since I'm pretty much over the whole chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=40

Herschel G.,"Lithia Springs, GA",134,60,392,5.0,8/12/2013,"Following our awful experience across the way at Rosa Mexicano (see my last review) we were starving even more than we had been earlier.  And needless to say, we were eager to have any semblance of a decent meal and would almost settle for halfway-decent service. We had never been to CPK despite all the good things we had heard, so we decided to give it a shot. We were seated right away and greeted by our waiter ""Really Good Actor"".  My wife asked him to repeat his name, and sure enough he said it again: ""Really Good Actor"". Never caught his real name, but I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume he is an aspiring Thespian.  Either way, he was a very nice enthusiastic server who lifted our spirits, and I hope his acting career takes off. Drinks were obviously made with high-end ingredients and were not watered down at all.  If you're looking to get a buzz before dinner, try the Top Shelf Long Island Iced Tea.  There was a minor issue with my wife's drink, but RGA took care of it right away. For appetizers we got the Tortilla Spring Rolls.  Fresh, flavorful and just downright good.  That Thai peanut sauce was awesome all by itself. I had the Jambalaya Fettuccine, and when I ordered it RGA got a look on his face of excitement that told me this was one of his favorite dishes.  And I saw why.  Perfect Cajun spices that weren't over-the-top hot; perfectly-cooked pasta and lots of shrimp, sausage, chicken and crawfish.  It seemed to get better and better the closer I got to the bottom of the bowl.  Hope my wife wasn't embarrassed because I HAD to grab some bread and sop up the rest of that sauce.  It would have been a shame to waste it!   RGA suggested the butter cake for dessert.  His exact words were ""it's a beast"".   It is indeed... Think of the best pound cake you've ever eaten, and then think of that cake on steroids.  Heat it up and throw some Haagen Daz on top then drift off into a sugar coma.

We were already at Lenox Square, but they were no longer seating people, so thought we'd have to go to the location near Perimeter, which is in the other direction we were heading, so it was a delight to find this locale. Upon going in we were told there would be a 35 minute wait for a table, but we could sit at the bar if something became available.  Within 5 minutes, I was sitting at the bar and ordering my drink.  We were offered an outside table, but in 35 degree weather in late December, I don't care if there are heaters, I'm not spending $15 on a pizza to sit outside in the cold to eat it.  I've been a fan of the chain, and this visit made me just as much so.  Our waiter, Brent, was not all smiles and charm, but he was efficient, quick, and didn't let us go lacking for anything napkins, honey for our hot tea, water, appetizers, and PIZZA. His facial expression didn't change one bit the entire nite.  Not even when I asked him if he could make me a hot toddy.  He ran down the list of teas, I made my choice and he bought back to me in the nicest presentation.  Just like some high end place.  Small things like that make me happy.  My usual even when I buy CPK pizzas to pop in the oven at home is the BBQ chicken pizza.  I went with it again. I also had a wedge salad that as wedge salads go was fresh, had enough dressing and I was able to share it with my mother.  I don;t go for all the other tasty brands of pizza they hawk.  some places do certain things well, and for CPK its the BBQ chicken pizza.

We ate here so we could sit outside and hear the concerts going on outside at Atlantic Station, it was really the only affordable option to do so with a heated deck. I'd not eaten at a CPK in many years, because the last time I'd went I'd been underwhelmed, but every once in a while you are limited in your options. This was that time. This time, it'd be myself, my wife, and my in-laws.  My wife and I shared two pizzas, the Hawaiian and a Classic Pepperoni. My in-laws split a different pizza. First, the pizza. BORING. BLAND. Very little sauce added to the generic crust, with very little toppings. I understand they were busy, it was a Saturday night after all, but it seemed like it on the plate, and that's never ok. This pizza was no better and almost worst in some ways than frozen pizzas my wife makes at home sometimes. Certainly not worth the ridiculous prices they're asking for these things. Perhaps the BBQ Chicken pizza is slightly more worth it, but the pizzas I ordered sucked. Bad. Crust had no crisp, was chewy in the ""previously frozen, thawed out and heated up"" way. And man, come on, a little more sauce would have made it at least a smidge better. Then, there was the service, or, lack thereof. Maybe the guy didn't like coming out into the cold air. Whatever the reason, coming to deliver our food and coming to give us our check doth not count for real service. Drinks were not filled, we had to ask for plates to the manager, just a real lack of service at all. Guy was semi-friendly when he was around, just not very much around.

Our table top felt sticky, and the floors were dirty. The spinach dip we ordered was oily and not great. To be fair, our pizza was good. Our server was nice, but the service was slow and my water glass was empty for a loooong time. I'm not a super picky person, but all of these things combined left me underwhelmed at best. I've been to the Nashville CPK and had great experiences, but I'm going to pass on this particular location in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=80

Alexis C.,"Atlanta, GA",0,2,,1.0,1/16/2017,"Today at about 3pm my guest and I dined at the bar of this location. The bartender on duty at the time was Seth. First of all, upon entering the building somehow I became the host because I first had to acknowledge the young lady before she acknowledged me, the guest. She then proceeded to, in a less than pleasant tone direct us to the bar because there ""weren't any tables"". Reluctantly we complied, not because we'd intended on sitting at the bar, but because we felt like we had no other choice. We get to the bar and order fairly quickly. The beverage I ordered, the strawberry mango cooler, which I've had before at the Dunwoody location tasted not like I remembered so i simply asked for a strawberry lemonade instead. Inconsistency in the dining experience is not what I expected. Next came our pizzas.  I explicitly ordered a cheese pizza, light cheese with extra sauce on the pizza and on the side. So out comes the pizza. Honestly this had to be the most poorly made pizza I've ever had at any California pizza kitchen location. No symmetry whatsoever, I had more crust than actual sauce, and I didn't get any sauce on the side. Okay,  sometimes people forget.  But when I reminded Seth about my extra side of sauce,  this gentleman proceeds to give me a nice COLD scoop of marinara sauce on a saucer. Not only did I touch the sauce and feel that it was ice cold, but I could clearly see Seth from my seat. WHY WOULD I WANT COLD SAUCE ON HOT PIZZA?? Seth seemed to find humor in that, obviously. At this point I am so over the entire thing and we ask for the check. Somehow Seth forgot I got the strawberry lemonade instead of the poorly made strawberry mango cooler because it was still on the check.

I was talking the place up to my boyfriend so I finally took him to the one in Atlantic Station for dinner last Thursday night and to my pleasure, it was just as good as the ones I had been to in other areas. I got the Hawaiian pizza, which I had never had (from CPK) and it was delicious. Big slices of ham and pineapple all over the pizza, definitely no skimping on toppings here. My boyfriend ordered the Sicilian, which looked even better and devoured it, so it must've been good. haha  While their pizzas may be smaller and more expensive then other pizza places, you have to remember all of their pizzas are hand made (the dough and everything) and baked wood fire oven. If you want take out pizza for $7 that's cool, but the quality is what makes CPK's pizza prices a little more.  I also am in love with their Avocado Club Egg Rolls! My best friend and I used to order these if we didn't want pizza along with another small plate and just eat those for lunch/dinner. I have also had their salads, which are all pretty good from what I remember but haven't had them in a while.

They have an excellent choice of salads, but they keep retiring my favorites.  Greek-Mediterranean, the old Steakhouse Chopped salad - both gone.  But there are always plenty of choices. The apps are all decent enough, but my favorite are the Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings.  The are served with a zingy soy-ginger chili sauce and topped sesame seeds spring onions.  They are delicious and addictive. Now let's talk pizza.  I am a big fan of their honey-wheat crust under just about any pizza.  My usual choice is the White Pizza. 5 cheeses, sauteed spinach and I add the bacon.  Rich and delicious.  The pizza always comes out perfectly cooked with a crispy crust and perfectly melted, but not over done cheese.

Lisa C.,"Miramar, FL",805,406,1477,2.0,6/23/2011,"On a night I was hanging out with my kids, while waiting to see Green Lantern, we decided we'd grab a bite to eat.  I let the kids choose from the vast variety of choices available to us at Atlantic Station.  And their choice for CPK was where it all began to go wrong...except we just didn't know it yet. When we first walked in I was pleased that it didn't seem overwhelmingly busy, which was a bit surprising for a Friday night, but no complaints on my part.  We were informed that we'd have a 5-10 minute wait.  Not a problem since we had approximately an hour before our 9:45 show was to begin.  We were seated at our table promptly, our drink orders were taken, and were told our waitress would be with us shortly.  The kids got their flavored lemonades soon enough, but I would have to wait....and wait....and wait for my drink from the bar. Finally, just as I began to become nervous about how much non-productive time had passed (not ordering, not eating, and no drink for me), at about 9:20 our waitress finally shows up to take our food order.  She had already passed by some time earlier and apologized for the wait.  By this time, I felt the need to inform her that we were pressed for time as our movie would be starting in 25 minutes.  And oh, by the way, that Moscato I ordered....I like it now please. To their credit the food arrived quickly, and that relief was soon displaced by the disappointment in the meal itself.  Fortunately I ordered a pasta dish for myself, and rather enjoyed it.  Not so lucky for the kids, who opted for 2 different varieties of pizza.  I didn't realize that the Hawaiian in the hawaiian pizza referred to the fruit punch they must pour into the sauce to give it that ""special"".......well, I'm not sure what it is other than it was not in the least bit, enjoyable.  Same for the white pizza my daughter ventured into.  We all ended up sharing my pasta dish and had to pass on the much anticipated dessert in order to catch our movie. Overall the experience was just, ok.  The service was extremely slow, and the pizza was disappointing.  I'd give it another shot if it were just for the service, chalking it up to my bad timing, but I just can't imagine enduring another round of ""guess what's in this pizza"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=100

It took the waiter another 15 minutes to bring room temperature water with no ice and the rest of the meal did not go better. I still tipped our waiter in the end but apparently it wasn't enough to compensate for his lackluster performance and he rudely and quite loudly complained to the other waitstaff and then was bitingly sarcastic as we were walking out.

Patrons were almost sitting on each other. We had to squeeze our way to our table. The food made up for our tight position in the restaurant. We started off with drinks...the peach tea was amazing!!! The lemonade was a tad bit tart but it was worth trying. Then onto the appetizers. We tried the Avocado Club rolls. I'm still speechless on how delicious they were and the dipping sauce made them even better. For the entree, I had a jerk chicken pizza it was above average, but my mouth was still salivating over the Avocado rolls though. The experience here was great, even though it's a really small and busy establishment. It was well worth the money!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=160

I come here for the ridiculously delicious Waldorf salad (Field greens, chilled-grilled chicken, seedless grapes, Granny Smith apples, candied walnuts, celery and Gorgonzola cheese; with Dijon balsamic vinaigrette or blue cheese dressing), expensive but HUGE in portion size. I hardly ever order salads at restaurants, but this is the one place I just have to.  I've heard their other salads are just as good, but the Waldorf has stolen my heart and since I don't come here often, I haven't tried anything else thus far.

I had only been to CPK once or twice before at Perimeter with coworkers and never really liked it, but a bunch of us came here the first week Atlantic Station opened because everything was free. The pizzas have always looked pretty bad to me. I think they are small and overpriced. I remember seeing one that looked like they had taken a salad and just dumped it on top of the pizza. I think I ordered the white pizza. As I sat there looking at the thing I was longing for Fellini's delicious white slice. Pretty much one or two of their slices equaled the whole CPK pizza and CPK wants to charge much more for it. At least it was free for me that night. I am annoyed by pretentious places like this.

Sarah E.,"Lawrenceville, GA",229,397,1,3.0,6/13/2009,"I am not really into chain restaurants OR pizza, so you may want to take my review with a grain of salt.  I very rarely give more than three stars to ANY chain, and when I do it's usually for a place that other people don't love nearly as much as I do. I went to this location two nights ago with some co-workers.  We had a round of drinks that were tasty but seemed to contain VERY little alcohol, which is a little sad for the price.  We also had a spinach and artichoke dip appetizer, which tasted fine but was kind of skimpy on the chips.   My entree, the buffalo chicken pizza, was surprisingly good.  I don't know why, but I am always surprised when I order pizza here and it's good.  I've never had a bad experience or anything, the pizza is just always better than I expect it to be.   Our server was pretty prompt and attentive for the most part.  He kind of disappeared for a while after our food came out, though.  It didn't seem like the place was swamped, so maybe he was in back doing sidework?  I don't know, but it was a little annoying because we were trying to leave and a couple of people wanted to get to-go orders for family members.  The person to my immediate left finally flagged him down and asked to order something to go.  He seemed surprised that she would need a menu before actually placing the takeout order. Other than that, I have no real complaints.  If you have been living under a rock and don't know this already, CPK is FUSION pizza.  So if you go here expecting your standard meat-mozzarella-and-red-sauce fare, you will be sadly disappointed.  However, if you can tolerate the chain atmosphere and are looking for a somewhat creative pizza, you might enjoy this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=160

Rick D.,"Acworth, GA",54,188,20,1.0,1/4/2009,"Where to start with this review... We were in Atlantic Station to see the ""Bodies"" exhibit. We were pretty hungry so we went in here and initially left because of the wait, but after checking at another place decided that rather than pay astronomical prices across the way that we would rather pay only ridiculous prices for some overblown pizza.  After this experience, I wish we would have paid the astronomical prices across the way. Things started when we got seated in the back of the little area that would be facing the patio if they had opened the ""garage doors"" and I think this is where parties get seated that are either loud, grungy, with children or just edgy enough so as to cause other patrons alarm.  Anyway, I digress.. so the first waiter comes and takes our drink order and informed us he isn't our waiter but that he will be right along to help us and the waiting begins... So we get our drinks, 10 minutes later and then along come the appetizers we ordered with the drinks about 5 minutes after that. We place our food orders, 2 pizzas for the one couple and a pasta dish to share for me and my significant other.. and then we wait.. and wait some more.. and wait some more after that. Well, the pizzas and pasta make it out but one of the other couple needs a fork and knife to eat hers and me and my s/o need silverware and we dont have any on the table so we ask for some, meanwhile our food is getting colder by the minute. Eventually the wait gets so long (10 minutes) that the person who needs the silverware to eat her pizza gets up and just as she does the waiter appears and brings us silverware.  Then another drink get ordered and the wait begins again. Oh, did I mention that we were still waiting on another drink that was ordered right after the appetizers? So that drink finally shows up but without the other beer that was ordered 5 minutes before. How can you go to the bar and bring one drink and then not just grab a bottle of beer and bring it all at the same time? So the wait begins again (sensing a pattern here???) and then 10 minutes later the beer shows up. We ask for the checks and, you guessed it, we wait another 10 minutes to get the checks and then when we hand them the folios he disappears for another 10 minutes. By this time the other couple is so ticked off that they get up and head outside (they paid cash) because of this and I am waiting to get my card back for yet ANOTHER 10 minutes. Finally I get my card back and tip (with appropriate reduction for what I felt was bad service all around) and we get up and leave.  I think, ultimately, I spent more time waiting than I did eating this meal and for that, this place gets 1 star.  Service was bad, food was decent, but combine the two and you get this.  I won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=160

Nicole M.,"Atlanta, GA",27,84,2,1.0,6/19/2008,"CPK should stick to making frozen pizza.  I seriously considered walking over to the Publix (which I could see from my table) and buying a frozen pizza and then asking if they could heat it up for me.  No doubt it would have been better than the crap they serve.   First, I have NO idea why I even decided to eat at CPK other than it was convenient at the time.  Next time, no matter how hungry I am, I will go somewhere else. Second, the food was awful.  We ordered the thin, crispy crust pizza and the first one we got was a piece of rubbery, microwaved crust with some crappy toppings on it.  The crust was actually cold when we got it even though the cheese was melted.  I also ordered a salad which was pretty flavor-less despite the beets, eggs, herbed ranch and bacon (how does bacon have no flavor?). Third, the service was less than good and for a chain restaurant, I would expect some basic service requirements but since the manager  was so rude to everyone, I'm sure expectations are low.  It took forever to get our food and it was 1 pm (after the lunch rush but not during a shift change).  We had to hunt the server down to ask him to re-do the crappy pizza they brought us, which I found annoying -- he should have come back to us within 10 minutes of dropping the food to check to see if it was OK.  I used to wait tables, it's not that hard no matter how ""in the weeds"" you are.  The manager told one party to ""Follow me NOW!"".  Not a ""please follow me"" or ""Hi, how are you?  I will lead you to your table.""  I was quite shocked at the tone of his voice and the words he chose.

She made suggestions and answered our questions. We ended up ordering a small app - chips and guac, shared a pizza - five cheese tomato, and a desert - strawberry shortcake. All the food was great. I wouldn't expect gauc to be good at a pizza place but we were pleasantly surprised. It was delicious. I had never had pizza before at CPK and I was happy with our selection.

The Italian Deli sandwich comes with ham, salami, and pepperoni on herb cheese focaccia bread. This sandwich is usually amazing and I usually crave this sandwich for weeks to come! While the sandwich was still good, I didn't have the magical warm and fuzzy feeling that I have at the end of my dining experience at California Pizza Kitchen. Both side items are good. I enjoyed my Caesar salad but had the chance to taste the cole slaw and it was by far the best cole slaw I've ever had.  Moving along to my drink, I was so disappointed. The margarita lacked flavor... Maybe the bartender was new. I dunno. Just wasn't feeling it. Overall, the food was good... Just not great. Our server was friendly. I am not ready to give up on CPK...

On my last (and only) visit to this one, before heading to the movie theater, I had the half Cobb Salad, and it was all I expected it to be. I love their Cobb Salad - it has lots of big chunks of avocado and you can get beets on it. This place gets a crazy wait with the crowd including lots of families. I really don't think I have to worry about them not doing well for all that time I wasn't coming here. Anyway, we bypassed the line by snagging some seats at the bar. The service here was very quick and we got our food very fast, although our Mediterranean plate appetizer came out literally 30 seconds before our salads and that was a slightly annoying (the Mediterranean plate went largely uneaten, although it was fine, if not great).

Don't judge me.  So yes, I happened to be at Atlantic Station and hungry and craving a salad. CPK seemed like the obvious choice. I typically go with the Thai Crunch, but a quick googling of the nutritional facts made me swear that one off forever. Bummer. So instead I opted for a lighter one with some sort of miso dressing, avocado, edamame, jicama, and other healthy fixins. A half order, of course, because their full sized salad encompass an entire garden's worth of veggies. I was a little disappointed by the lack of goodies in this one, though: I think I found one chunk of avocado in the whole salad. Still, it tasted pretty good and didn't totally eff up my diet, so I was pleased.  During the course of my lunch here, I had about 4 different servers and they were all a little pushy with the upsell. No, I don't want an appetizer. Or a cocktail. Or bread.

Great for after a movie, because you get another two more hours of free parking. One cool thing is that the food comes out amazingly fast...like almost in an odd sorta way. Makes you wonder if they have the frozen variety from Kroger chillin in the kitchen waiting to get zapped. Anyway, like I said, a good bet.  The one odd thing about this location...and odd in a way that's actually pretty humorous...this location has a thing about hiring some of the most boring servers.. EVER. I don't mean that as an offense to anyone but only as a sincere observation. The service brand here is PERSONALITY FREE. I don't think I've ever seen anything like it so I can only assume that it's intentional. It's actually worth the trip just to see it...very robotic and faceless.  Of course someone will read this, go there and get a real charmer....but dollar bet that if you go back the next week, THEY WILL BE GONE. :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=180
Rebecca O.,"Atlanta, GA",356,299,10,2.0,1/15/2007,"Call me harsh, but I think CPK is overrated.  Although the food is always consistent, I wouldn't consider it constantly outstanding.  Nothing here is above par, though all is pretty decent. Good pizza - I prefer mine on the honey wheat dough.  Tasty flavored lemonades, although the flavor is accomplished via a few squirts of Torani syrup (not that I have anything against Torani). I don't understand, and probably never will, the appeal of the not just room temperature, but cold, white, uncrusty bread they bring to the table.  That just doesn't do it for me.  Call me crazy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=180
A G.,"Ellenwood, GA",0,72,1,3.0,1/30/2009,"My sisters brought me here for my birthday.  The pizza was good but I'm just a good ole Papa John's type of girl!  I first of all don't like the fact that you have to buy a whole pizza!  (It has like 5 slices and it's $10 or more depending on your toppings) This seems like it should be the type of restaurant where you can buy a slice (like Felini's - I know it's not the same but they put me in the same mind set.) Me and my sisters never like the same toppings so we ended up with 5 different pizzas.  The ground beef or italian sausage (whatever it was!) was huge, I just was honestly disgusted. The waiter was not prompt at all.  I know it took him like 15 minutes to bring our check after we asked, then he had my sister's cards forever, I don't like for anyone to hold my debit card for too long!  All in all I just really wasn't impressed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=180
Morgan C.,"Smyrna, GA",53,14,8,5.0,12/8/2010,My family gatherings always seem to take place at CPK Atlantic Station. I have no complaints about this. I only wish it were easier to select which pizza to hungrily devour. The Greek was a long running favorite but now I'm starting to lean toward the Wild Mushroom pizza. I also tried the Pear and Gorgonzola pizza which was quite an experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=180
T. Murray -.,"GA, GA",97,264,10,4.0,3/1/2007,"Who doesn't like California Pizza Kitchen? In the middle of a shopping spree, before a movie or during an event being held at its home, Atlantic Station, this location is the perfect solution for the hunger that typically comes along with a day of frivolity.  During the week the wait can be longer at lunch than at some of the surrounding options. You have to make it a point to get there early if your impatience is going to be driven by your hunger pangs.  This California Pizza Kitchen also has a nice bar. Get a cocktail to go with your gourmet pie. If you are with a group, the menu has options for people who don't want to eat sliced goodness, making this a restaurant with the potential to please everyone in your part.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=180
Ebony S.,"Atlanta, GA",0,46,11,3.0,3/30/2010,"PRICEY FOR ""OK"" PIZZA Ok, lets be honest here. No one goes to this place because this is the best pizza in town, or even because its cheap. I would say 90% of Atlantic Station CPK's customers are people who are waiting on a movie or some other event, and decided to grab something to eat. Since the selections at Atlantic Station isn't stellar people decide just to go anywhere. That is exactly what I did on Friday night. A friend and I was waiting on a movie and decided since CPK was the only place that didn't have a ridiculous wait time, that we would eat there. I had the chipolte chicken pizza, and it was good. It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either. Also a frozen margarita. With me and my friend splitting a pizza and both of us ordering 1 drink, i think we paid about $40 total (including the tip). I must give them credit for the orginality of their pizzas. I have seen things on their menu that you normally wouldn't see at your average pizza bar.  To our surprise, on a very crowded night, there was 2 seats available at the bar, once we sat down, we realized why. The room between seats was very small. That didn't bother me too much though, I didn't mind the couple beside me they turned out to be quite nice. I've always liked sitting at the bar in restaurants, and sitting at this bar was great. Since the kitchen is open you could see everything, being made. And since it was still a little cool outside the heat from the brick oven felt great.  I wouldn't say this is a kid friendly place (although I might be a little biased since I'm not a big fan of children in restaurants), and I heard the salads are very good here. All in all this is is a ok choice because it was convenient. This wouldn't be my first choice, but when I go to Atlantic Station, and want something to eat, I wouldn't mind this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=180
Kathie S.,"Maryville, TN",9,31,3,4.0,12/20/2009,"Thoroughly enjoyed our meal. I had the vegetarian tricolore salad pizza. Yummy! It was an arugula salad with shaved parmesan on top of a thin-crust pizza. Fabulous (although more than I could eat myself). My hubby had the Thai chicken pizza, flavorful and not too heavy. Others in our party had the Asian salad and the asparagus soup. Everyone LOVED their meals. This is a family-friendly restaurant, with servers who were very friendly and helpful and even though this is the weekend before Christmas, we did not have to wait long for our table. We will definitely return in the future!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=180
Tulie L.,"Atlanta, GA",481,390,23,3.0,8/4/2008,"Solid BBQ pizza... My friend had the Creamy Penne w/ chicken, and the penne was slightly undercooked to me. This place is like any Cali Pizza Kitchen,right down to the decor.. Our waitress was very friendly, and for a quick bite to eat before a movie, without feeling disappointed,, this is your place.. consistent food, nothing to get excited about, but it won't make you pissed off before a movie either.. and for the convenience it's a bonus..it's located almost across the street from regal theater's in Atlantic station.  My BBQ pizza was delicious, would like a little more BBQ sauce on my chicken but it was still tasty.  The diet Pepsi did have a funky taste but maybe that was just my palate playing tricks on me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=180

Daniela S.,"Douglasville, GA",37,52,,3.0,6/27/2009,"Pizza is okay, but the prices are steep!  I was surprised at the size of the pizza for how much it cost!  Luckily I ate a snack right before or I would've left still hungry!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=180
Matt H.,"Loganville, GA",37,116,45,3.0,3/28/2009,"I wouldn't have normally come here, but we had a $50 gift card (which turned out to be just the right amount for me and my wife - tip included).  We went on the weekend about 6 or so expecting to wait...and we did.  The wait was about 45 minutes, so go earlier if you hate waiting around.  We got the cheese bread appetizer which was awesome, and the pizzas we had were pretty good to but nothing special.  If it were not so expensive I would probably eat there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-2?start=180
