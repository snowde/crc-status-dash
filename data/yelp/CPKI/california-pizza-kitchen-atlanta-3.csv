Nicole K.,"Atlanta, GA",153,8,2,1.0,11/9/2014,"Bad experience. The Manager Angelica was extremely unprofessional in her dialogue with the patron in addition to her appearance . Her sly remarks, we are not in the business of giving free food in response to rectify an issue with food ( but you give away free bread) , her sarcastic grins, and rolling of her eyes is not appropriate or a quality a manager should possess. Her appearance was as sloppy as her attitude problem. She was wearing a rough dry shirt and her hair was  not neat. I suggest a manager boot camp or something!  Apparently she didn't take math. You threw away a $20 salad for what would be less than $3-4 cost to rectify a loyal patron.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=40
Alpana M.,"Atlanta, GA",183,107,171,4.0,8/30/2014,Been to many CPKs but the service here was great. Mojitos were delicious. I usually order my favorite which is the BBQ chicken chopped salad or the BBQ chicken thin crust pizza but this time I decided to try the mushroom pizza. Our order was messed up and our server realized before he even brought it to us. He let us keep both and didn't charge us. Mushroom pizza was good. I would definitely come back here again especially because of the great service and presentation of food. Location is great inside Lenox mall.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=40
Neha G.,"Atlanta, GA",12,68,81,4.0,3/12/2016,I go to CPK for their think crust pizza and my most favorite was their Tiramisu! I am so sad that they no more offer that in their menu! I wish they can include that back- I will increase my frequency of going to this place again! I have been to mostly all of their branches in Atlanta! I like this one but I don't like that this one is in mid of the mall! It's give more food court feeling then restaurant! Service is great! We had once issue with service and left the comment! The same waiter served us next time and he was at his best! But I loved the best CPK at perimeter!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=40
Pamela S.,"Waxhaw, NC",140,234,302,4.0,11/17/2013,"Went to CPK for dinner on a Sat night.  Family of 4 and we arrived at approximately 7:00.  We expected to have a long wait, but we were seated within 15 mins even though the restaurant was fairly busy.  We had two pizzas and two salads to share.  My Mom and I each had a (giant) glass of Red Sangria... YUM!!!  We ordered a small Caesar salad, small Moroccan Chicken salad, Garlic Chicken Pizza, and The Works pizza.  Everything was delicious!  My favorites were the Moroccan salad and the Garlic Chicken pizza.  Service was fast, friendly, and attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=40
Lily T.,"Atlanta, GA",85,23,34,5.0,6/24/2013,Love their spinach dip! And I love the Asian Salad and  The Original BBQ Chicken chop!

Diedre R.,"Atlanta, GA",374,944,582,4.0,10/23/2013,"When I say I've been going here 20 years, its no exaggeration.  For years, I've worked, played and ate at Lenox, and while I normally just hit up the food court, there are times when my mother and daughter act as if I'm such a snot for not wanting to go to this verison of CPK. Well, for one thing, if its a busy mall day, it can take up to an hour to get sat.  Are you serious?  Yes.   It has somehow maintained the same location at Lenox since forever, but yet, you always run into people that ask if you know where CPK is.  That being said, its a great ""meet-up"" location, as almost anyone can tell you where its located.  I've eaten the pizzas, the salads, the pastas, and tried the Sangria. I say yes to them all.  Never had an issue with staff, as they are mostly young, and probably appreciate having a job in the world famous Lenox Square.  94 of 100",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=40
Jamie P.,"Atlanta, GA",41,200,74,4.0,10/13/2013,"I absolutely love this place! The pizza is delicious (try the BBQ chicken!) and the pastas are just wonderful. It'd be hard not to find something you like here. The portions are fairly large too. Despite being in a mall, it's set apart somewhat, so it doesn't feel like you're in a food court. If you come in during a peak period, you might have to wait a little to be seated. Otherwise, it's all gravy, or BBQ sauce!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=40
Don D.,"Atlanta, GA",124,153,5,5.0,8/14/2014,"I had never been to a CPK but I've been a fan of their frozen pizzas for sometime.  The wife decided she wanted a date night so we got all spiffed up for a big night of people watching at Lenox Mall and headed over to CPK for dinner. The server was a REALLY great server.  Very helpful and welcoming and kept our water glasses full but didn't bug or annoy us.  We ordered a starter of the Thai Crunch Salad and it was absolutely amazing.  We ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza with Bacon and I have to say that I was totally making sweet love to my face.  The pizza was so fresh, hot, and delicious and it was the perfect size.  Actually, I totally could've had TWO of those mo fo's but I probably would've died right there.   CPK is a bit pricey but I have to say that it was worth every penny.  The quality of the food and service really made for a great evening.  We capped it off by going people watching in Bloomingdales and running in the rain to our car!  All in all,  a pretty fantastic night!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=40
Sam C.,"Atlanta, GA",1,14,3,4.0,5/6/2015,The jerk chicken pizza is the BOMB and I'm a huge sweet tea guy.  This place has a cool vibe and good staff.  The one in Lenox Mall is my favorite~,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=40
Leilani A.,"Conyers, GA",30,59,174,5.0,12/23/2014,"This was my first time at the pizza kitchen and I really enjoyed it. The waiters were all super nice and always smiling. They were also extremely helpful when I was confused about the new pizza they had. We ended up ordering the works and Hawaiian pizza. That was one of the best works pizza I've had in a while. The toppings were generous and the crust was soft with a little bit of crisp to it and that saying a lot because I don't like thin pizzas. However, I didn't really like the Hawaiian pizza, the pineapple pieces were to large and it just wasn't all that appealing to eat or look at. I wasn't expecting such a small pizza so my only regret is not ordering one for myself. This place was awesome and I would love to go here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=40
Jay S.,"Jefferson, GA",44,68,159,3.0,10/25/2014,"Was in the area with some friends and wanted to grab some dinner and decided to go here. I ordered the hawaiian bbq pizza and a white tropical sangria, and to sum it up nice and short, you get your moneys worth. The pizza was good, crust was light and not to heavy, and the sangria was awesome and a pretty good size. This is a nice place to eat with friends or if your in the area and don't want to spend to much i would reccomend this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=40
Kristen C.,"Gainesville, GA",10,14,5,2.0,5/18/2015,"I was disappointed by my experience here.. The service was mediocre, the meat lovers pizza was basically slices of deli meat layered on top of a pizza, and you don't exactly get to choose what size of pizza you want.. Strange concept to me. However, the kung pow spaghetti was pretty tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=40
Mayona R.,"Decatur, GA",3,8,2,3.0,8/6/2016,"The food was pretty good and that why it has 3 starts however the service was mediocre. Me and my fiancé had to look for the waitress to order our meals.

Kevin M.,"Princeton, NJ",704,838,1247,3.0,10/9/2012,"Came here for dinner after being in the Atlantic Station area and hearing it was a decent place from my buddy. The atmosphere is ok, a mix between all ages and it seems like a place has a little bit of everything for everyone. The line was incredibly long and we waited about 20 minutes for a table to open up. Had a few drinks at the bar in the mean time. Once we sat, we started off with some chicken lettuce cups. They were ok.. Definitely not anything special at all. I then ordered some grilled chicken with veggies and my gf ordered a BBQ chicken pizza. I had some of the pizza and it was pretty good. Nothing amazing, but definitely pretty good. My grilled chicken dish was very basic and didn't blow me away by any means.  We ordered some red velvet cake for desert and that's always a pleasure. Enjoyed that very much and that, for me, was the highlight of the meal. Certainly not saying the food here is bad, but it just isn't anything special. I would go out of my way to come back here, it was just ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=40

Great job ! It was the topic of our meal conversation (:  But let me back up. The Host staff was warm and welcoming. The waiter, ( Brad ), was friendly and knowledgeable regarding the ingredients....

Phoebe T.,"Marietta, GA",49,553,4,4.0,2/5/2014,"Came here on a weeknight and had the most wonderful server. I do think their pizza's are a bit ridiculously priced (LOVE the bbq chicken pizza though), but I got a coupon for a free small plate (the quesadilla is good) and my strawberry lemonade drink was always filled so there were no complaints here. Come on a weeknight and there will be great service.

As a former hostess in a busy midtown Manhattan restaurant, I really appreciated this! The greeting hostess could have been friendlier and maybe smiled as she took our name but the quick wait and seating made up for this.  The pizzas were perfection, our server was great! I can't remember her name but we were sitting in the second to last booth right by the escalator.  We will be back again!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=40

Stuck right in the middle of everything, this open-air, yet surprisingly quiet place offers a variety of seemingly strange pizzas to delight all tastes.

Angel L.,"Atlanta, GA",257,158,61,4.0,11/4/2013,One dish Hawaiian BBQ pizza...ok.. a couple more... salads and that arugula pizza ... as you can tell. I have several go to dishes that I love.

Katherine G.,"Powell, OH",5,21,3,3.0,3/1/2015,CPK is always reliable for a decent salad or pizza.  This one proved as consistent as the rest.  I had the asparagus argula salad.. a small plate that was the perfect size.  The spinach-mushroom flatbread could have used more seasoning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=60
Danae G.,"Atlanta, GA",83,102,132,4.0,12/1/2014,"After walking around Lenox for a few hours I've ended up here a lot. I'm okay with that I love their pizza and it's super convenient because it's right in the mall. I usually get pepperoni or the BBQ chicken pizza. I can't decide which one is my favorite. They do allow you to do half n half which is kinda like the best of both worlds. The last time I came here I decided to do half pepperoni and half White Pizza. It was absolutely delicious and getting spinach on my pizza made me feel like I chose a healthy option lol. The servers are really cool and fun here everytime I've went we've laughed and joked around with them. Also, my friends phone was dying and our server let her use his charger to charge her phone. That's cool because it's not fun to have a dead phone. If you usually say no to dessert and I usually do because I'm full...don't do it here. Get the Butter cake, I can't put into words how good it is. So just get the butter cake.

Server was really nice and attentive. Food was not as good as other CPK's I've eaten at. Just a little off. Pasta a little overlooked. Olive oil a little heavy.

Jules H.,"Atlanta, GA",0,47,9,2.0,11/27/2015,"Since this location has been closed for renovation we were so excited to see them back open on Black Friday. There was such a long wait to dine in we got our order to go.  I guess they lost some of their regular personnel while the restaurant was closed and with all the newbies they are having operational challenges.  Our pasta was very dry.  Despite paying and tipping for our order when it was placed, when we came back to pick it up we had to wait an extra 10 minutes while the very person we paid had to look through the receipts to make sure we had paid.  Why not ask to see the receipt instead of holding up a number of other guests waiting to place  and pick up orders?  Hey guys Cheesecake Factory gets it right every time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=60

This location is in Lenox Mall in Atlanta, which makes it somewhat difficult to get to, but fun to visit if you are out shopping. Our server was efficient, but did not smile once at us! However, the food came out in a timely manner. The pizza could have used a bit more sauce, but other than that was fantastic as usual. The manager came around to our table to ask how everything was.

This particular spot always delivers when it comes to service and the food is consistently good. They recently started serving olive oil dip with their bread and I'm not really a fan of the spices used in the oil so I opted for ""good ole butter"".

It was a Sunday evening, and T and I were famished after a LONG day at the mall. We literally couldn't leave the mall before eating SOMEthing. I was lightheaded and the whole 9 yards.  The only place open was CPK. I have never been to a CPK. I was slightly irritated but T loves this place, and well, I have no reason not to trust my husband's judgment! Our server was INCREDIBLY friendly and welcoming. I ordered the mango italian soda - OMG it was amazing. Not too sweet, was mango-y and just REFRESHING. And I got a refill and wasn't charged for it! (Free refills on fancy sodas!! Yay, chains!) We ordered the Barbeque Chicken Pizza - wow.  The crust was perfect, the pizza was bursting with flavor, had a ton of fresh veggies, and was very satisfying.

Angela K.,"Decatur, GA",8,65,,4.0,7/19/2012,"Wanted a quick lunch after making some returns, and this fit the bill. Ordered the half CPK Chopped salad, and it was excellent as always. Even with it beng a ""half"" size, I still have leftovers to take home. My server Naomi was warm and pleasant, even with me being a table of one; host was also friendly and accomodating, not making it a big deal to give me a booth. One minor annoyance was they were conducting a survey wherein you sample their new pizza and fill out a critique in exchange for a gift card you can use towards your meal. I get it that a tab for one person doesn't meet the $ threshold, but they could at least acknowledge me and explain that when every table around me is being fawned over by the survey lady and tasting some new bbq pizza.  I mean, eating alone is always a little awkward...that kinda made it more so.

It has become ""cookie cutter"" food just as most of the other fast casual chains have done.   Had the pepperoni pizza and it was OK, but I've actually had tastier frozen pizza from the supermarket (and not even the CPK brand).  Wife had the thin crust margahrita and it was very bland.   And the price is way too high for the quality.  Each pizza was about $12 and they are just large enough for one person.  Not a good deal at all.  Would rather just go to the supermarket and get a $5.99 frozen pizza and eat it at home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=60

I ordered the Shrimp Scampi Zucchini...surprisingly this dish was good! I almost at the entire thing...which is not good and I believe I will spend the entire weekend running it off, but hey when it's good it's worth it.  The atmosphere was nice we had good conversation, the waitress came by and refilled drinks accordingly made sure everyone was comfortable and enjoyed their meals, had enough napkins...you name it, she did it!  We were full and just about comatose when we left but sure as my name is Tanesha I waddled right out of there with my food baby leading and back to work (after stopping at Sweet Hut).

Emily S.,"Decatur, Atlanta, GA",106,61,57,4.0,1/14/2018,"This CPK is a bustling location in Lenox Mall. It's above the food court but below the main level of the mall where most of the stores are. We came here on a Sunday around 3pm and had a 10 minute wait which wasn't bad at all. Our waitress came promptly and took drink orders and then returned to take our order for food. I got the pepperoni pizza and my boyfriend got their Caesar salad. While you wait for your food, they bring out bread with olive oil to dip it in. The bread is warm and crispy on the outside but soft on the inside (yum!). Their pizzas are on the large size for one portion so two people could easily share one, but if you're very hungry or eat a lot, it might be worth it to order your own.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3

For desert you gotta try the butter cake!! OMG its the best butter cake you'll have in your life. Way better than the butter cake sold at Hortons Steakhouse believe it or not. It just melts in your mouth. My mouth is watering just thinking about that cake. The staff is always nice and the restaurant is always super clean.

Daralynn L.,"Marietta, GA",56,198,33,5.0,3/19/2017,"My go to spot every time I'm at Lenox Square Mall. I took my nephew whom has always wanted to see Lenox Mall. I explained to him I'll take you to my restaurant for lunch ..as if I own it hehe I've always loved how it's situated in the mall above the food court. It's certainly draws your eyes to it. There is a waiting area as I walk in. We were seated quickly. Some things changed since my last visit. There was a station in the front with a tv and a place where the staff keeps your glasses filled with beverages.  Have never had any issues with the food or the location. The staff is always friendly . The tables are always clean and the food is always good. I guess I'm just lucky when I eat here as opposed to other reviews.  I will admit I play it safe and order the same thing each time. My favorite order is half caesar salad. It was far from being a half salad, but no complaints here. I ate the other half for breakfast. Also the Thai chicken pizza; with grilled chicken breast with peanut sauce topped with  bean sprouts,  carrots and slivered scallion. My nephew ordered a spicy chipotle chicken pizza. It was topped with chipotle adobo sauce,shaved poblanos and Monterey Jack with roasted corn & black bean salsa, fresh cilantro and a  lime crema; which is a sauce on the side. He was too chicken  to try the sauce.  See you on the next review.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3

I had their Waldorf Chicken Salad which was very good.  I would have to say that part of our group order 1/2 salads and the rest ordered full salads and they came out the exact same size.  Not sure if this is normal or not.   As for our server, he was a disaster.  We waited more than 10 minutes for him to bring the bread to our table - even though the restaurant was almost empty.  Once he took our orders he never came back to check on us.  We got no refills on any of our drinks - even the almost $3 ice tea.  We had to flag him down (took a while to find him) to get a bill.  We asked for to-go containers and a to-go salad dressing.  He brought the containers - with no bags - but no salad dressing.  As it had been 1 hr and 20 mins by then we just went ahead and left.

D.J. K.,"Atlanta, GA",96,263,960,2.0,8/5/2016,"Will usually eat here on Friday's after work when I hit up Lenox Mall. It's not the best quality food or service, but it beats eating in the food court. We always end up getting the same thing within our group of 3 (my sis and BIL).  -BBQ Chicken Salad - I always request dressing on the side here just because if you dont they normally drown your salad in dressing. -The Sicilian on thin crust and light cheese - meat pizza, but less carb so I feel less guilty! I like that CPK has a thin crust option for their pizzas. It still satiates my pizza craving and it's pretty tasty. -Chicken Lettuce Wraps or Jambalaya Fettuccine (alternates between the two) - Just OK. I always request less salt for both. They don't always use the freshest lettuce or if they even wash them for their salads.  I've also noticed they are increasing using more iceberg than romaine lettuce. Sometimes lettuce looks dirty.  Sometimes the service is slow and just lack common sense at times. I always feel like they are understaffed when they are slammed.  Oh and every table should get complimentary bread. If they don't give it to you make sure you ask your server for some.  But hey, if you're looking for a sit-down restaurant in the mall, CPK is super convenient since it typically has less wait time than Cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3

Andrew S.,"Duluth, GA",31,7,,3.0,11/23/2017,"Located inside one of Atlanta's most upscale mall, the Lenox Mall, there is a casual dining restaurant chain that specializes in California-style pizza. It is California Pizza Kitchen. The California Pizza Kitchen is known for its innovative and nontraditional pizzas. I have tried California Pizza Kitchen in my different locations statewide and I would have to say this location was one of the best and the worst experience ever. Since this location is inside the mall, it is loud as expected and would not be consider fine dining to me. Now for the Positive notes. The Server was very professional, gave us pointers on which we should order with good suggestions, very attentive, and customer service oriented. (Customer Service was on point for the Server) Now for the bad. The two hostess at the front was not friendly at all and had a dull face when was greeted. They had no customer service experience and showed that they did not want to be there. I had a pair of customer sitting right next to me at the bar, who was debating if they should steal the Wine glass that they were drinking out from and literally walked out with it. If the hostess were paying attention, this would of not happened at all. As a business owner I would definitely be worried. What if they walked out with Alcohol in it, what would have happen? Nevertheless, the food was great! I Suggest trying the Shrimp Scampi pizza, it is Housemade lemon-garlic shrimp with caramelized onions, Mozzarella, Parmesan and red chili, topped with fresh arugula and wild Greek oregano. I am only giving 3 stars because of the Server, Customer Service, and the Food.I will probably give this location an another Chance to Redeem themselves once again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3

Judy L.,"Atlanta, GA",519,285,1922,4.0,2/8/2016,"I would say that this location of CPK is the center of the Lenox Mall Food Court. I've eaten at the Lenox CPK over the years and am still a loyal fan of California Pizza Kitchen. I've dine there twice since they finished their renovation a few months ago. They are still busy as ever as I always see people waiting to get seated which is a good sign that their food is still great even after renovation.  My first time after the renovation was for an early dinner after shopping for a few hours. They did not have any available tables so we opted to sit at the bar since we were starving. We ordered light by sharing the CHICKEN CLUB PIZZA, which is my usual order at CPK. I love how they give complimentary slices of French Baguette and olive oil for dipping. We definitely helped ourselves by asking for more. The service was great near the beginning but was dwindling toward the end. Had to grab our server's attention several times. I think next time I would wait a bit and sit at a regular table. The bartender was both a server and making drinks at the same time.  My most recent visit was exceptional. I was able to try a lot of their new items from their menu. Service was phenomenal. Everyone was so nice and described to us the new items on their menu.  Overall, I do see myself dining at CPK quite frequently in the future. I love a few items on their menu and I can't find it anywhere else.

Stephani M.,"Airport Mail Center, CA",607,405,1744,5.0,5/6/2016,"#94 Yeah, okay... So I came to ATL from California, and ""yes"" I have had the pleasure of California Pizza Kitchen on the west coast, so can the east coast really do California Pizza the way Cali can?   I was shopping at Lenox and met a few friends there.  We were really working up an appetite running around this HUGE mall.  There are several choices in the mall proper to decide upon; however, we all agreed a martini lunch with salad was in order.  CPK it is! There was a little wait to be seated, but that was okay.  We grabbed cocktails from the bar and the time truly flew by as we planned out the rest of our shopping excursion.  The hostess called our name for the table and off we were.  The restaurant is beautifully designed, especially for a chain restaurant.  It overlooks much of the Lenox mall area and is totally open in design.  The employees looked happy to work in such an open atmosphere--shoot, I would like to work in an open environment like that too.  It was really modern, clean and fresh looking.  Everyone had smiles on their faces and cute shirts, easily identifiable. Once seated, our server greeted us with charm and knowledge about the menu.  There were several salad options, so we wanted to know what was her favorite--and why.  She never skipped a beat.  Informed us about the ingredients, the pairings, the most popular salad, etc.  She did not just describe salads to us, she brought out a couple of her favorites from each section of the menu.  The choices all sounded amazing--this is going to be harder than I originally thought. We decided to go ""family style"" so we could try a few items but not commit to anything: Bianco Flatbread Thai Crunch Salad Chicken Tequila  And lots of martinis... The flat bread was really delicious.  I think there were about three or four kinds of cheeses sprinkled on this thin bread along with fresh sage and truffle cream.  Really simple, yet really tasty.  Next came the salad.  It was absolutely HUGE.  There were rice sticks, fried won tons, a delicious mix of cabbage slaw, tons of veggies, peanuts, chicken, avocado and a stupendous dressing to tie it all together.  Finally, the pasta came out after the salad.  A massive plate of spinach fettuccine served with chicken, onions and peppers, cilantro and some little kick of heat in a creamy sauce.   Everything was yummy.  I think what I love about CPK is that they are super consistent no matter which location you visit.  That is always a plus in my book.   Stephani Smiles for CPK ;) #bringfriendsandshare",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3

They suggested I get a kids sized pizza and a salad, which is what I did and was actually a good alternative in terms of portions and variety. The Waldorf Chicken Salad was good even without dressing. The pizza I chose was the barbecue chicken, and it was woefully dry. Barely edible. That said, the service (Holli) was excellent and the adult beverage menu is pretty excellent, too.

Their pizzas are big, 6 slices (well maybe not big for some). I usually like splitting a pizza and salad with someone. They even have different crust options to choose from.  They are a little pricy for pizza, anywhere between 12 and 16 dollars for 1. Their pastas are good too and portions are big.  In addition the service great!

The drinks are super well made and super creative - avocado, blueberry, and etc. - not too alcoholic, but perfectly well balanced. 3. The decor has completely changed! They used reclaimed wood to give this open and super modern feel. 4. People watching - where do I start. 5. Some of the best service I have EVER HAD.  Minor annoying features 1.

This particular CPK is one I tend to frequent the most, if I'm feeling it, and in the area, and the staff is always rather friendly as well (also given they sometimes goof up my drink choice, but they're really nice about fixing it.)

It was not busy at all when we arrived. Who knew California Pizza Kitchen offered more than pizza? Well, I know now. They also have salads, pasta, flatbreads, main entrees, and other items. I ordered a white pizza, usually my fave. They have a different spin on the white pizza, adding spinach to it. Since I have liked spinach on other pizzas I have ordered, I thought I'd give it a go. Big mistake. I didn't realize this would be stewed spinach. Ick! Who wants that on pizza? It was terrible. I tried to pick out as much of it as I could. I was also not a fan of the cheese - tasted weird. Well, at least they had Coke freestyle. That is the best thing I can say about this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=20
Allen W.,"Doraville, GA",0,2,,1.0,7/17/2016,"There's a girl working in take out window. I don't wanna post her name. Very bad attitude when I ask her the price of my picking food(cuz I'm picking for my coworker)and she didn't give me receipt, when I'm asking the receipt, she just walkaway. Few mins later, other guy come to print it for me.  I think ur store should send a well trained people come to work, not someone like this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=20
Berhane A.,"Atlanta, GA",634,154,1348,5.0,2/10/2016,"They recently remodeled this location and it is gorgeous now! It's modern and up to date. The tables are made of butcher block and they have a ton of that reclaimed wood on the walls. It was a pleasant surprise to see how beautiful everything was. Ok on to the food.., I've never had anything bad from this establishment. I've tried so many of their pizzas I could tell you how each one tasted. But my absolute favorite is the spicy chipotle pizza. I'm a big fan of corn and black beans & this pizza has that and more. You also can't go wrong with any of their salads. I usually get the salmon one. I usually don't do deserts but my best friend introduced me to the butter cake and omgggggggg it's so good! You have to get it w/ some ice cream because it comes out warm & the ice cream helps to balance the temperature. The staff is always so friendly. The servers, hostess, and to go employees always seem to be in a happy mood. Overall 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=20
Gina K.,"Atlanta, GA",0,5,22,1.0,3/5/2017,"I have been here before and have loved the environment and food. However, today we got seated right away around 2.  Ordered an appetizer, the lettuce wrap, and got that shortly after. His name is Cameron.  Ordered drinks and it didn't come. Not even the water came.. isnt that the basic??  A glass of white wine and a corona. Didnt see our server for 20mins. So finally flagged him down and he said,"" what did you order?"" So he basically forgot. Had to even flag down another server to ask about our drinks.  Then another 20mins later we flag him down again. And he said that the bartender is busy making the drinks. Making a glass of wine and a beer? I saw a customer sit in front of me and they got their slushes and wine before I flagged him down the last time. He got in my bf face and we decided to leave. The server told us that drinks are ready but you can leave if you want. No apology. Nothing! Just an arrogant kid.  Just sucks because I have great memories here.  All i wanted was a glass of wine! Thats all.  Then the manager is too busy doing everyone elses job. Very poor management and the way you train your employees!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=20

M B.,"Atlanta, GA",1,31,,5.0,5/23/2017,Great lunch spot if you're visiting Lenox Square. They recently went through a remodel and it looks wonderful. I love the chic open air design - very cosmopolitan! I eat here usually 1-2 times per year. The food is always delicious and there are so many unique entrees to choose from. The waitstaff is always friendly and accommodating. The food is a bit on the pricy side but well worth it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=20
Mary Margaret B.,"Atlanta, GA",396,305,1100,2.0,12/13/2013,"This place is a bit of a nightmare... Appetizers were alright, the food is good here. The service sucks ass. Sorry to be crude, but it just does. An hour to get a white pizza, veggie pizza and Thai crunch salad? Oh ya, and no refills on our drinks. After the long wait we FINALLY got our pizza and it was ICE COLD. Thank God I already asked for a box because if I wanted to eat it at the table I would've pitched a fit. I didn't see our waitress forever and after using two gift cards and still receiving a $45 bill the manager was completely unconcerned.  After I had mentioned that we were in a huge hurry he wanted more explanation. After then learning the pizzas were served cold he gave the false air that he gave a damn and explained to me in so many words that the hood was broken.  I'm in the industry I know things happen but if there was a kitchen issue the manager should have come by the table or AT LEAST our server could've given us a heads up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=20
Cristie B.,"Camp Wood, TX",0,26,4,5.0,11/18/2015,"From the beautiful dining room and friendly waitstaff to the delicious food it was definitely the highlight of my day.  I had checked out the menu after seeing it in the mall as my coworkers and I were in town for a meeting, and surprised at all the choices.  I had the half-sized roasted veggie salad and also the two soup combo with Sedona Tortilla and Split Pea.  Way too much food but somehow I managed.  We unknowingly timed it just right, this was their first day open at the Lenox mall in Atlanta.  Highly recommend it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=20

Tiff H.,"Dunwoody, GA",952,1379,5345,3.0,10/20/2014,"An impromptu lunch during work. We were going to explore the food court but got stopped here instead. Lunch service had died down since it was later in the afternoon. We were seated promptly by a nice guy who constantly toyed with us (he was kinda cute hehe) and took good care of us. He had us download the CPK app so we could get a free appetizer. My free appetizer was the white corn guacamole and chips, and on top of that, I ordered the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pizza. The guacamole was light and easy to eat, although it wasn't seasoned too strongly, so it lacked it a little flavor. However, I still couldn't stop eating it. The pizza was hearty and full of flavor, which was completely opposite of my guacamole. But the kick it gave you was relieved by a light lime and avocado sauce (I assume was what it was, the menu didn't indicate that this was provided). I left CPK with half a pizza left over and a full belly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=20
Maria Eduarda M.,"Atlanta, GA",106,127,101,4.0,12/27/2015,"It's a good chain restaurant, but most of the time have waiting list. I like their pizza and the arugula salad. I order the pesto pasta with shrimp and Cesar salad and both were very good . The kids pasta sauce was a little bit dry but it was a lot and 2 small kids can share it.

Annie C.,"Atlanta, GA",241,407,980,3.0,3/8/2014,"California Pizza Kitchen is for me, the ""happy medium"" restaurant, in that it's a restaurant where everyone can find something to suit their tastes at a decent price point.  This particular location is smack dab in the middle of Lenox Square's food court wing, and seems to be perpetually busy - particularly on weekends. Prepared to be in for a bit of a wait for a table and then for your food - which is enjoyable - over the years I've had their pizzas, pastas, and salads and I've yet to find any fault with them - decent portion sizes, nice dish presentation, and overall - tasty. However, on my last visit, I decided to deviate from the norm and order one of their taco entrees: the ""Carnitas Tacos"" ($11.97 + $0.99 for avocado slices), which came with a side of salsa and black and white corn tortilla chips. Again, palatable, but incredibly overpriced for two tacos (TWO!) and a side of chips - I couldn't help but think of Buford Highway and the bounty of tacos $13 could allot. I'll stick with the pizza next time.  Generally I like CPK, but this location's much too crowded, the service and kitchen expedition is slow - go to a free standing location for a more enjoyable experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=20
Britt K.,"Atlanta, GA",26,26,1,5.0,6/7/2015,"We took my daughter there after shopping to get her pizza and we were looking forward to the Gluten Free pizza there, but they had run out and informed us before seating, which is appreciated.  Apparently, gluten sensitivity is becoming more popular and that's a good thing in my book. We asked about an appetizer that wasn't marked GF and the kind manager Aaron went well above and beyond the call of duty to pull one together.  We were blown away by the kindness of him and the staff.  We got the Waldorf Salad and my daughter got the white pizza.  All were good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=20
Jayati A.,"Atlanta, GA",0,1,,1.0,11/28/2015,Absolutely horrible experience especially if you are ordering take out. If you order ten things be ready to make ten trips before you get everything you ordered!! And when you go back they will tell you how they had indeed given everything that you asked for. And the worst of all is that all this happens after you check with them twice when if all is put when collecting the order (coz yes this is not the first time it has happened to you.) They are liars at best. Ahhh.. and in the end when I check the order is still wrong.. Can the service BE any worse??,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta-3?start=20
