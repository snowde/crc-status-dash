Leslie T.,"Atlanta, GA",69,92,37,1.0,10/21/2016,"Can I give less than one star? Every time I come to this California pizza kitchen, which is very rare now, there is always a problem. Tonight I ordered my food, which were spring rolls, and when I got there the girl said that they had no guacamole. That is the only dipping sauce that comes with the Baja spring rolls. Last time they gave me a pizza that someone had looked like someone had taken a bite out of. It turns out it was a servers food they gave me by mistake. Stay away from this California pizza pizza kitchen. Eat anything else on the street beside this place. Seriously, thats probably why on a friday night the restaurant is a ghost town. I've worked in restaurants on and off my whole life, it's really not that hard to give a courtesy call and tell you that your item is out of stock.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=20

T M.,"Nashville, TN",0,33,,4.0,7/2/2017,I love CPK because they have the best salads around. I know this location has gotten dinged for service but the service has been great both times I've gone.

Les R.,"College Station, TX",5,125,318,5.0,12/3/2016,"To start, seated as soon as I walked in, greeted very nicely too. The waiter got my tea instantly, no wait! Then I was able to watch them prepare my Original BBQ Chicken pizza, and the ""oven wizard"" Cooke dot perforator, I like sitting at the bar, so I can see everything being prepared, cooked and then plated. Anyway, finally got it, it was perfectly cooked and tasted awesome! The service was amazing and if I lived near here, would be back on a regular  basis... so until next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=20

Customer service was superb which is rare nowadays. Our waitress's name was Carson, she was amazing! I will definitely request her for my next visit! The establishment was clean and the food was appetizing . I ordered the steak and Sicilian style pizza...

Sherry U.,"Hershey, PA",132,130,862,4.0,8/13/2016,Solid food.  Always do a split of a pizza and a half salad with lunch buddy.  Decor feels a little dated - needs a refresh.  Booths by the windows are a bit snug - get a 4 top instead.  Service is very friendly and they handled custom pizza orders well.  Join the rewards club it builds up quick.  They also cross promote with AMEX currently - spend  $40 and get a &10 credit on your AMEX.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=20

Hillary' E.,"Atlanta, GA",48,13,,1.0,12/26/2016,"I've been to this location a couple of times and service has been ok. Today, however, I had the worst dining experience I have ever had in my entire life. I went with my sister and my girlfriend at around 4 pm. My girlfriend's family is from Vietnam as are many of her friends. As we were walking to our table, my girlfriend was greeted by a Vietnamese lady whom my girlfriend knew because this lady is my girlfriend's friend's aunt. I thought to myself, since this lady knew my girlfriend, she was gonna be very nice and friendly to us but she was completely rude and racist.  She came over to my table and completely disregarded my sister and I. She only spoke to my girlfriend and only in Vietnamese. I did not even know she was asking what we would like to order because she literally only spoke to my girlfriend and only in Vietnamese. I asked the lady, whose name I later found out to be Mrs Hong, what flavor sweet teas they had and she rudely opened the menu and wavered her hand across the drinks section. I finally found the flavors for the sweet tea and asked for a raspberry one. She then asked my sister what she would like and she said she was going to share a drink with me. Mrs Hong rudely said we could not share a drink and proceeded to ask my girlfriend in Vietnamese where we are from. My girlfriend responded from Ecuador and Mrs Hong said ""that's why"" in Vietnamese.  I immediately wanted a new server but did not want to put my girlfriend in an uncomfortable situation. However, Mrs Hong continued to give me bad looks and disregard my presence every time she came around.  Food arrived when my girlfriend was in the restroom. She was sitting inside which made it uncomfortable for the server to put the plate down, so I offered to help put the plate down and Mrs Hong yanked the plate and refused my help.  After that, I had had enough. I asked for another server and she said OK.  New server came around and I thought that was the end of her rudeness, but I was wrong. She came to my table once again and handed my girlfriend a check, once again speaking in Vietnamese. She had given my girlfriend her very own separate check and had given her check a 25% off. She never asked if she was paying by herself, we always get one check. By this time I was fed up, so I was asking my girlfriend what this lady was saying because I did not understand. My girlfriend later told me Mrs Hong was telling her to not tell me anything.  That was the worst customer service I had ever experienced in my entire life. I asked Mrs Hong to call a manager. I was extremely angry at her rudeness, racism, and just lack of customer service to the point where I started crying. I had never before cried in a restaurant, I barely ever cry but that's how angry I was. I would not have cared if she had been all of that behind my back, but if you work in customer service, you have to fake niceness if you do not have a nice attitude. I have worked in restaurants, I've dealt with customers for about four years, I was a manager and customers have been horrible but never not even once have I acted the way this lady acted.  The manager was very apologetic and tried to make our visit right but there was nothing he could do. He took care of our order but we could not even finish our food out of anger. My sister was crying, my girlfriend was about to cry, and I could not help it but cry out of anger.  I am most likely never going back to this location and my advice to you is to ask for another server if you ever get Mrs Hong because my girlfriend told what happened to her friend and she explained that Mrs Hong is known for being racist.  I will definitely be taking this to corporate and I hope that their chain does not support racism and takes some action after this incident.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=20
Keturah H.,"Smyrna, GA",154,9,3,1.0,5/21/2017,"Ordered online. My boyfriend went in to pick up my order and all the servers waiting around all of the sudden had other things to do.

Nonah G.,"Morrow, GA",66,30,97,5.0,6/3/2016,I love CPK! I especially love this location. Whenever I go it's not crowded and the servers are always nice and helpful when you can't decide what to get...even though I always order the same things. It's either the tequila fettuccine or the BBQ chicken pizza.  both are delicious.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=20
Michael T.,"San Diego, CA",60,37,3,2.0,10/20/2016,"There are 2 major factors of how I feel about a dining experience: the food (obviously) and the customer service.  Food was overall good. Went for dinner and got a couple appetizers, salad, pizza, and a couple pastas. Spinach Artichoke dip with chips is always a go-to for me at CPK. No complaints here. BBQ Salad is always great, too. Still delicious as always. Pastas are good. Pizza was okay. Surprisingly, I feel like their pizza is their most mediocre food item they serve, despite their restaurant's name. This location's downfall is the customer service. The first person who greeted us and led us to our table seemed very disinterested and unenthusiastic. Our waitress really was bizarre. Way too casual, not at all professional. It seemed like she was digging into the depths of her soul to try to find her customer service self. Her service seemed forced and unnatural, hard to explain. Rarely anywhere to be seen, hard to talk to, and when she did come by our table, tried to take away food we weren't finished with yet. She wasn't necessarily rude, but she was definitely not friendly. At the end of our meal, she placed the check on our table and walked away - no words said. She spent most of her time chatting and hanging out with coworkers.  Her customer service ruined our experience. We felt like we were burdening her, and felt uncomfortable every time she came to our table.  Will not return to this location. It looked like most other waitresses seemed to have the ""I'm only here for my paycheck"" attitude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=20
Kellie M.,"Woodstock, GA",2087,394,547,3.0,5/11/2015,"I'm a fan of CPK from way back.  My go to is the BBQ Chicken Salad with a cup of the Sedona Tortilla Soup. During this visit my former boss lady and I went for lunch.  We ordered our normal salads, soup, and tried the Bianco Flatbread. The flatbread was pretty tasteless.  Being that this is a new signature app I would have thought it would be much better.  Our salads and soup were as expected. Here' the thing, lunch was way over $50.00 and we didn't event have WINE!  There are much better places around this neck of the woods for a lot less expense.   Service was mediocre, nothing to rave about. I hope CPK reorganizes a bit.  I really think it's a great concept but they seem to be missing the boat in so many areas lately!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=20

Nina N.,"Atlanta, GA",108,69,149,3.0,4/4/2016,"I'm a little biased because I love Antico's pizza; however, I'm going to comment on my pasta dish. I gave it 3  stars due to the following:  1. Location: it is pretty easy to get to... It's on Ashford dunwoody, .02 mile pass the mall on the left.  2. Service: the service was great. Our server was informative and accommodating.  3. Food: the server started us with a basket of complimentary bread and olive oil. Pretty good bread. My friend had the avocado and bacon pizza, which she really likes.  I had the Kung Po pasta dish. I didn't enjoy it. I honestly think it has potential, but the dish was so overwhelmed by salt that it was a little too salty to eat. Couldn't even taste the flavor. However, I took it home, added some water into it and recooked it - absolutely yummy afterwards.  4. Setting: there's plenty of seating inside and outside. It was raining the day I went, so couldn't enjoy the outside seating.  Overall, CPK is a reputable restaurant with great food to offer. I'm not a big fan, but that's just me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=20

Jyoti G.,"Seattle, WA",5,27,14,4.0,9/13/2015,"Food is delicious! They recently started a lunch 2 for $12 deal where you have a choice of either a soup or salad with a personal sized pizza - this is incredibly filling and worth the money! I ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza with the Mediterranean Salad, and both came out 1) presented beautifully and 2) incredibly fresh tasting. I did enjoy the salad far more than the pizza, but they both were definitely good.

Tuong Vi P.,"Atlanta, GA",133,759,2206,4.0,6/15/2013,"Was just here for lunch with some of my buddies from work a couple days ago. We were quickly seated (got there around 11:45 am)  and I noticed that this location was similar to any other CPK that I have been to. Not a bad thing. This is the thing with eating at a chain; hopefully, the the level of ambiance and the food is consistent from one place to the next. Our server stopped by within a minute or two and brought us all water. Asked if we were interested in some bread, to which one of my companions eagerly said, ""Yes!"" We perused the menu and I settled on the Moroccan Chicken Salad. Before our food came out, another round of bread was enjoyed by all at the table. Didn't try the other guys' pizzas, but they looked good. One had a special order, which was accommodated and brought out with no mistakes. Good sign. My salad was the half size, but it was the perfect portion for lunch. It was actually very fresh and yummy, with chunks of butternut squash and avocado throughout, in addition to the featured protein. We were in and out in less than an hour and we dined in! If you go after 12 pm though, I imagine that the Perimeter work crowds may swamp this place, like they do most of the eateries in this area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=40

Getting here after lunch rush should free up time to make a great pizza. We were seated by a smiling face and the approached by another smiling face. My point here is that the service was fine nothing amazing but it was average.    Everyone on my table order and I went last only because nothing I read felt that I was worth the suggested price. When I got my pizza I was right about my hunch. The pizza tastes like an average pizza maybe just a step above cici's and step under Stevie b's which to me isn't a compliment for a gourmet pizza place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=40
Thomas L.,"Atlanta, GA",8,79,33,3.0,4/6/2015,"I don't know what the big deal about CPK pizza is honestly. If you're baseline is Papa Johns and Dominos, yea CPK is better but if you do a little more searching around Atlanta you'll find really good specialty pizza at around the same price CPK charges.  When you're talking about almost $15 for a pie that might serve 1 or 2 people I kinda expect a really amazing pizza, but it doesn't have that ""I need to go there every week"" pizza quality you have with really nice pizza joints.  Blue Moon Pizza or Mellow Mushroom are def better options for a similar price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=40

Drinks - Fresh Agave Lime Margarita  For the appetizer We ordered the Avocado Club Egg rolls which if you're a sucker for avocado these are a must! The aioli sauce that accompanies the appetizer is ranch IN hot sauce and its delish; I'm not a big fan of ranch. Now to the good part, We stuffed our faces with two different pizzas. One was the California Club which is a hand tossed pizza. It's not a thick pizza it's relatively thin about 10"" oh my goodness this is a yummy pizza especially if you're into salads. Not saying this is a salad pizza guys no no. Envision this pizza more like a sandwich club :) the applewood smoked bacon, roasted chicken and mozzarella is put in the oven first and after they top the pizza with avocado and lemon pepper mayo arugula. For our second pizza we had a crispy thin crust roasted artichoke with spinach + chicken which was about 11"". Your usual mozzarella and Parmesan with chucks of artichoke hearts, roasted garlic with sautéed spinach. Of course this pizza was extremely yummy! Oh and I added goat cheese to Both pizzas.

Gill B.,"Atlanta, GA",88,155,26,3.0,10/16/2014,"My summary of my experience at the CPK at Perimeter: middle of the road chain restaurant, not so stellar customer service, lovely setting.  I came with a large group of ten co-workers for a little birthday lunch in the middle of the work week. It was not very crowded on this particular Wednesday afternoon - a few groups of two or three here and there spread throughout the spacious restaurant. I like the atmosphere of the bright, open dining room with lots of windows. We were seated at a long table in a little elevated dining area with booths lining the walls, and two giant flat screen TVs positioned above on the wall airing the NFL Network on both of them (which I certainly appreciated as an avid football fan!). There is also a little patio area outside that had about 5 or 6 tables. I arrived a little bit late to the gathering with one of my co-workers, and promptly asked for a water when I sat down. The server seemed a bit distracted and neglected to bring it while she refilled teas and brought out second sodas to the rest of the party. I politely inquired again, and she apologized. Very sweet! They had a little table tent promoting their signature cocktails including mojitos - my weakness! I had no idea that they offer such an array of fun cocktails. If I were to come in for dinner (and not with the work group), I could certainly be enticed to try these out (and perhaps I would bump my rating up a star or two). I ordered the chicken chimichurri, and was impressed when our orders came out in about 15 minutes. Well, most of them did. The servers promptly delivered the fresh looking salads and pizza plates to their rightful diners, but there seemed to be a bit of confusion on two of the pizza orders. One of them came out a good 15 minutes after everyone else's, leaving the forgotten party member to scarf down his pizza long after everyone else had finished. This was a bit frustrating on a not-so-busy Wednesday lunch break when we all felt a bit rushed to get back to the office for meetings and email inbox control. The food was decent. I thought that the sauce was a little spicy, but the chicken was a good texture and the veggies were cooked just right. Satisfactory meal. The place gets a passing grade, but I was by no means blown away. There are so many great dining options in the Perimeter area, so this one can easily be overlooked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=40
Steven G.,"Clarkston, GA",57,177,50,3.0,7/18/2014,"Good pizza, odd environment, ok service...3 stars is right.  I love pizza (who doesn't), and I like weird pizza and CPK is the place for odd/unique pizzas.  Great menu selections and different way varieties than what you would expect at your typical pizza joints.   Ok, so the food was great, no complaints there!  I had the thai-chicken pizza with thai-peanut sauce that is both spicy and savory.  It was awesome!  They pulled it off and ate every bite!  My wife loved her pizza, too.  Food is A+ The layout & vibe of the place is strange.  I felt like they were reaching for a semi-fancy sit down vibe, yet it didn't quite make it there.  LIMBO is the best way to describe it...somewhere between sit down fancy and casual.  There is an identity crisis going on and it confused me; not enough to scare me away but I had to scratch my head over it a few times.  Again, because of the weird limbo-thing the service is stuck between 2 worlds as well.  I felt like we got good service at times and just OK service at times.  I'm conflicted, yet again.  I want to go back (mainly for the food) and give this place another shot.  I think with an understanding of what to expect and maybe a different server that my opinion will change.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=60
Heidi P.,"Marietta, GA",806,491,1824,3.0,1/17/2014,"I have mixed feelings about CPK. Eaten here 2-3x and I can't tell if it is supposed to be fancy or not. I guess I always had it in my head that as far as chains it was a slightly more upscale pizza place. However everytime I go in there, my first thought is wow there are a lot of children in here.  It is like the food is a 3.5-4 but the atmosphere is 1.5-2. It is a large, pretty badly lit room with no walls. The sound is just all over the place and it feels more like a cafeteria than a restaurant. Pepperoni pizza pie just under $12 plus white truffle oil for over $1, chicken avocado spring rolls about $9, 6oz glass of wine 7.99, soda probably $2. For about $36 for 2 people, I think it is pretty good. But I would probably see it as a better value if there were less children. It brings it back to like a Chili's or TGI Friday level. Which is not terrible but super lacks excitement and uniqueness.  Very friendly wait staff, although the hostesses can work on their warmth and ffiendliness.  Also, very large Americn flag, like huge, on the wall. We always wonder why not a California flag?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=60

I've been here many times and have never had a bad meal. Their salads are really great. Perfect options for meat (I always choose the salmon) and fresh, FRESH ingredients make it a complete meal. Oh yes, they're not shy about the onions and that brings the salad alive.  Of course, their pizzas are great too. I have an appetite for the spicy stuff so I choose the habanero carnitas pizza.

Once again I ordered the Margarita Pizza, and it was NOT even close to what it has always been. Canned tomatoes smaller size It was awful! When I ordered it a week ago I just assumed they ran out of ingredients. But no they have changed everything. The bread is smaller and not as fluffy.

He loves the Thai chicken pizza and every once in awhile he craves it. There are definitely better places to get pizza in the area, so this wouldn't be my first choice, but it isn't horrible.  We had two servers and they were both super attentive. One guy was training and I had to help him figure out how to use the pepper mill, but other than that they are very nice and accommodating. I got the spinach and artichoke thin crust. The crust was half crispy half floppy, but tasted good. I could tell based on taste that the spinach had been previously frozen and the artichokes came from a can. Two simple changes to using fresh ingredients would have definitely elevated the pizza. I personally think I can make better pizza at home.

After receiving my drink, nothing more than water, another 15 minutes went by before the waitress returned. At that point I asked to speak to the manager in an attempt to discontinue a bad experience at my first dining experience at that location. The manager was apologetic and offered a free appetizer. I declined her offer as all I wanted was satisfactory service. Interestingly, when the manager asked who my server was, I pointed out the person and the manager rolled her eyes. The impression left with me was the manager knew this server was a problem. The manager then offered to watch our table closely and at one point refilled my water glass after I had already sat with an empty glass for some time.

It's another restaurant we don't have in the Northeast, so if I need a pizza fix and I'm traveling I know that they're reliable. On this visit I ordered the chicken quesadilla appetizer off the small tastes menu. At 5 dollars it was a great value. It was very tasty with a little spice and the side dipping sauce had some kick as well. The portion was tiny, but for five bucks you can't expect a huge portion. For my entree I tried the white pizza with applewood bacon added to it. The pizza was passable, although somewhat dry, it had decent flavor. I guess it's to be expected from a pizza without red sauce on it. In my opinion it needs some oil on the crust. My server was excellent, very attentive to my needs and quick to offer a refill on my soda. This was OK, the price is good, the portions are generous, but the flavor leaves me looking for something just a little better. Overall, serviceable, but nothing to go out my way for.

When I first came into the restaurant, I was greeted promptly and seated. After that, it went downhill.  So my server was K (I can still be nice by not sharing his full name.... K will do.) It took K about 5 to 7 minutes to even greet us. Now I must say, I understand that servers get busy so I let it slide. By the time he came to greet us, we already knew what we wanted so we placed our order. I didn't know it took 5 minutes to just bring water with lemon, but who am I to judge? Maybe they have a well in the back of the restaurant? So he brings the water and bread to our table FINALLY. Then.... It was a game of Where's K? I kid you not.... I did not see K for about 20 minutes after he dropped off the water. Not only did he not give us straws for the glasses, he didn't even check on his customers! Why is it that I see servers around us frequenting their tables constantly? Ok.... So K then decides to check on us. I then ask him ""K, where have you been? We haven't seen you in a while."" His response is ""I have other tables and had orders to take."" I then respond back ""Ok, but we are your customers, too. You haven't checked in with us for about 20 minutes. We don't have straws and wanted more bread."" Instead of apologizing and remembering that the customer is always right (guess he wasn't trained on that) he tells me ""Well I had to take X amount of drink orders blah blah blah""... Sorry that I cannot remember the rest of the bull that crawled out of his mouth. He had a smirk on his face and an attitude that I definitely did not find acceptable if I'm paying MY money and part of YOUR pay. I then asked for the manager..... Manager comes. Shouldn't have even asked for him. Didn't resolve my disappointment, so we advised that they lost a customer, which I don't recall hearing a comment on. I understand it's your job to nod and agree to what I say, but please be aware that I deal with customer service on a daily basis. I know how frowns can be turned upside down and how to make customers happy from a bad experience.  So beware. If K is frequenting numerous tables, he will forget about you. That was the excuse I was given, just not in those terms. So sad because I was definitely hungry for a grilled chicken caesar sandwich. I took my business elsewhere and will never return!

Also, when I pay $14 for an individual pizza, it better be stacked with meat. This one was not. I had about 5 pieces of sausage on two slices, but had a hard time finding the sausage on the other slices. The entire pizza had only 1 piece of salami.

I was absolutely starving...starving to the point of gnawing my hand off...to the point of snapping at any point if even asked a question. Then solution...or so I thought...CPK! Then I hastily placed my order & scurried over there for my pick up excited for what was to come. Only to 1st be disappointed at how incredible tiny the pizza's were for the price I was paying. Then I get home & think to myself...ok I'm starving so anything should taste good at this point right? WRONG! The Hand tossed pizza which I mistakenly made half & half (for an extra $2 might I add) was crazy BAD. The pepperoni & cheese tasted cheap and the bread was flavorless. The Hawaiian BBQ Chicken literally tasted like dog food....or what I imagine Dog Food would taste like.

They have a large lunch crowd and we only waited about 10 minutes to be seated. We were promptly greeted by our server almost instantly and she was pretty good about recommending some new items and she was attentive. Their chop salad is by far one of the best in town and adding barbecue chicken makes it extra good (I recommend that you hold the peas, though).  I wish that they made a smaller portion of the salad that could be eaten with pizza.  We ordered salads plus I wanted pizza, but by the time it got to the table I was already full and didn't enjoy it as much as I could have.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=100

Although, the appetizers were very expensive! I am a picky eater and we got the Avocado Egg Rolls for an app, they were delicious!!! I ordered the Chopped salad and the dressing was amazing. The salad is not worth the price you pay, I am not a big fan of the salami being shredded on the salad. At the end of our meal she suggested a dessert to me because I told her that this was my first CPK experience, I really liked that she went out of her way to point out what her favorites were. When we got the tab, she charged me for that Diet Pepsi that I never received, which I just took out of what I would have tipped her. Little mistakes like that can ruin a near perfect experience.

If you aren't a fan of garlic, then, you shouldn't be looking at this pizza at all. But if you do like garlic..def recommend this pizza.

You can normally tell when someone is being fake friendly or when they are genuinely nice- So she was one of those genuinely nice people who like what they do.

My wife and I had pasta bolognese and pepperoni pizza.  Everything tasted good.  The service was quite good.  The atmosphere was nice, though unfortunately there were a couple kids yelling through much of our meal behind us--not that that is the restaurant's fault, but is a shame that that happened.  The taste of the pizza is as good as I could ask for.  One small drawback is that the crust was a little hard (for my taste), particularly on the end of a piece.  All in all, though, the food is quite good and this place is worth going back to. As for the red velvet cake, we ordered it as takeout and had it later.  We liked it a lot.  It was not too ""cheesy"" because of the good texture of the vanilla ""whipped cream"" cheese icing.  The cake was moist and sweet, and it is one of the best red velvet cakes we have had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta
Kendall S.,"Pompano Beach, FL",99,43,161,4.0,3/16/2017,"I always enjoy California PizzaKitchen and this experience was no different. I met family for a quick lunch and was quickly seated at a table. Our waiter Terrence was so wonderful and made us all feel right at home. He quickly brought us water and gave us time to look over the menu.  I ordered the mac and cheese bites for an appetizer. Honestly I wouldn't recommend these. They were a little too greasy on the outside and not cheesy enough on the inside. Luckily there are plenty of other appetizers like the hummus and spinach dip that are soooo god and I wish I'd ordered instead.  At least I knew my meal would be perfect! My cousin ordered the side by side soup. It looked so good and I loved the presentation of the two vibrant soups in the white bowl.  I ordered the Jamaican Jerk Chicken pizza. I absolutely love the crispy crust and the flavor combination of the chicken, bacon, peppers, red onion and seasoning. The portion size is huge! For the price and the amount you get is a great deal. Even though they say the pizzas are a personal size, two people could easily share. The thin crust pizzas are slightly bigger than the regular. My cousin had the wild mushroom pizza which is her favorite and my aunt had the Moroccan chicken salad. She was disappointed in the salad stating it seemed like it was missing something and wouldn't order it again.  Terrance really went above and beyond as our waiter. He heard me say in passing there was no way I'd be able to finish my meal and brought over a to go box without me even having to ask. If you go here, ask to be seated in his section.

Jacqui H.,"Atlanta, GA",22,89,200,3.0,3/15/2017,"Was in the Dunwoody area and we were with a vegetarian who suggested this place.  We also had another mate who had previously been going on about how great the pizza was, so decided to try it out.  It was 12.30pm so lunch time and there are heaps of office people out so it was relatively busy, but we were able to get a booth.  The service was a bit slow, we asked for the drinks menu and the waiter kept pointing to the menu we had, after two attempts he finally got that we didn't have the actual drinks menu at our table.  Ordered our drinks and food together, got the Blueberry Ginger Smash cocktail, Blue Moon beer, Shrimp Scampi Zucchini ($14.79), Spicy Chipotle Pizza ($13.99) and a vegetarian pizza, I didn't try it and don't remember the name now. Shrimp Scampi Zucchini - had more zucchini ribbons than fettuccine, when they say a touch of fettuccine, it is literally just that.  It tasted ok, the garlic flavour came through but it was still a bit bland.  Quantity was more than enough and I had to pack it up as I couldn't finish it.  I ended up putting chilli sauce and a home-made spicy gravy on it - wish I had that before, it was amazing lol.  The mix of the lemon garlic and spicy gravy was so good, will definitely try making it at home some time. Spicy Chipotle Pizza - I tried this without the adobo sauce, which is apparently what makes it spicy.  The pizza on its own is mild and honestly a bit weird with the corn on it.  I wasn't a fan, it's a bit of a funny mix.  The base was nice though and I liked the pizza crust - if that counts. Overall, CPK didn't really deliver on my expectations - it was sold as one of the best pizza places in ATL, so that didn't help their case either I guess. Service wasn't great and most importantly the taste wasn't either.  If you're not particular about the food you're having then I suppose it would be good as the quality and ingredients are, and just to be a bit positive, maybe I need to try some of their other menu items.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta

For us that's prime time dinner time, but this place wasn't super busy. About 8-10 tables were full.  We ordered drinks and then the guacamole and chips. The appetizer was really good. Sweet corn mixed with avocado and black bean salsa. They also brought out bread with herbs/spice mixed in EVOO. Delicious. Bread was soft and spice mix was really good as well.  My husband ordered the pepperoni pizza on thin crust, and I got the BBQ Chicken on Thin Crust. The pizzas were a lot larger than I expected!! They were delicious and so filling!!  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is our waiter was subpar. He disappeared for 15-20 mins at a time so our drinks did not get refilled in a timely fashion. And he had the personality of a wet sponge. We'd say thanks for something and he wouldn't even smile or acknowledge. Maybe he was just having an off day, but definitely not personable like I saw other wait staff being with their tables.

I wasn't quite sure so I asked the waiter and she said the roasted garlic would be a good choice because it's a restaurant favorite. I wasn't too sure about this pizza because there wasn't that many ingredients that go into the pizza so I thought it might be too plain. But when the pizzas came out. Oh goodness. The supreme pizza was kind of just whatever. The reason it tasted so whatever was because the garlic pizza was so bomb..!! I had no cloud it was going to taste so amazing. If you aren't a fan of garlic, then, you shouldn't be looking at this pizza at all. But if you do like garlic..def recommend this pizza. The garlic flavoring isn't too strong or weak, but good enough amount to taste in the bites. The taste was very unique. I also got the zest cilantro lime sauce on the side cause that sauce is heaven.  But overall, I had a great experience and def will have to come back for to try out other items!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta
Gretchen Y.,"Atlanta, United States",14,57,109,5.0,12/5/2017,"Came here on a Saturday night almost 40 minutes before closing with my parents. I was a little worried the food and service would be bad because it was pushing 10pm but everything was great. I don't remember our servers name but she was amazing. You can normally tell when someone is being fake friendly or when they are genuinely nice- So she was one of those genuinely nice people who like what they do. The table behind us even asked to speak to the manager to compliment her service. I don't remember what pizzas we ordered but they were both delicious. My mother ordered the Jambalaya Fettuccine that comes with blackened chicken, shrimp, crawfish, Andouille sausage, and Tasso ham. It was a big serving of pasta and surprisingly had a lot of shrimp. it wasn't mostly chicken with 2 of this and 2 of that which was nice. I always enjoy my food no matter what CPK I go to- but this place gets 5 stars because of the server. Please. Listen. Make sure you order the butter cake. Don't turn down the waiter when they offer you a dessert. Even the description in the menu says ""Trust us. Just try it.""  Seriously. Just try it.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta
Derek G.,"Decatur, United States",0,64,78,4.0,1/7/2017,"I went here for the first time today and was very pleased with the food and the experience.  My wife loves red velvet cake, and we went here partly because we found out red velvet was on the menu and partly from a pizza craving that struck when we were in this area. My wife and I had pasta bolognese and pepperoni pizza.  Everything tasted good.  The service was quite good.  The atmosphere was nice, though unfortunately there were a couple kids yelling through much of our meal behind us--not that that is the restaurant's fault, but is a shame that that happened.  The taste of the pizza is as good as I could ask for.  One small drawback is that the crust was a little hard (for my taste), particularly on the end of a piece.  All in all, though, the food is quite good and this place is worth going back to. As for the red velvet cake, we ordered it as takeout and had it later.  We liked it a lot.  It was not too ""cheesy"" because of the good texture of the vanilla ""whipped cream"" cheese icing.  The cake was moist and sweet, and it is one of the best red velvet cakes we have had.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta
Kendall S.,"Pompano Beach, United States",99,43,161,4.0,16/3/2017,"I always enjoy California PizzaKitchen and this experience was no different. I met family for a quick lunch and was quickly seated at a table. Our waiter Terrence was so wonderful and made us all feel right at home. He quickly brought us water and gave us time to look over the menu.  I ordered the mac and cheese bites for an appetizer. Honestly I wouldn't recommend these. They were a little too greasy on the outside and not cheesy enough on the inside. Luckily there are plenty of other appetizers like the hummus and spinach dip that are soooo god and I wish I'd ordered instead.  At least I knew my meal would be perfect! My cousin ordered the side by side soup. It looked so good and I loved the presentation of the two vibrant soups in the white bowl.  I ordered the Jamaican Jerk Chicken pizza. I absolutely love the crispy crust and the flavor combination of the chicken, bacon, peppers, red onion and seasoning. The portion size is huge! For the price and the amount you get is a great deal. Even though they say the pizzas are a personal size, two people could easily share. The thin crust pizzas are slightly bigger than the regular. My cousin had the wild mushroom pizza which is her favorite and my aunt had the Moroccan chicken salad. She was disappointed in the salad stating it seemed like it was missing something and wouldn't order it again.  Terrance really went above and beyond as our waiter. He heard me say in passing there was no way I'd be able to finish my meal and brought over a to go box without me even having to ask. If you go here, ask to be seated in his section. We had a great meal and I look forward to returning again soon.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta
Jacqui H.,"Atlanta, United States",22,89,200,3.0,15/3/2017,"Was in the Dunwoody area and we were with a vegetarian who suggested this place.  We also had another mate who had previously been going on about how great the pizza was, so decided to try it out.  It was 12.30pm so lunch time and there are heaps of office people out so it was relatively busy, but we were able to get a booth.  The service was a bit slow, we asked for the drinks menu and the waiter kept pointing to the menu we had, after two attempts he finally got that we didn't have the actual drinks menu at our table.  Ordered our drinks and food together, got the Blueberry Ginger Smash cocktail, Blue Moon beer, Shrimp Scampi Zucchini ($14.79), Spicy Chipotle Pizza ($13.99) and a vegetarian pizza, I didn't try it and don't remember the name now. Shrimp Scampi Zucchini - had more zucchini ribbons than fettuccine, when they say a touch of fettuccine, it is literally just that.  It tasted ok, the garlic flavour came through but it was still a bit bland.  Quantity was more than enough and I had to pack it up as I couldn't finish it.  I ended up putting chilli sauce and a home-made spicy gravy on it - wish I had that before, it was amazing lol.  The mix of the lemon garlic and spicy gravy was so good, will definitely try making it at home some time. Spicy Chipotle Pizza - I tried this without the adobo sauce, which is apparently what makes it spicy.  The pizza on its own is mild and honestly a bit weird with the corn on it.  I wasn't a fan, it's a bit of a funny mix.  The base was nice though and I liked the pizza crust - if that counts. Overall, CPK didn't really deliver on my expectations - it was sold as one of the best pizza places in ATL, so that didn't help their case either I guess. Service wasn't great and most importantly the taste wasn't either.  If you're not particular about the food you're having then I suppose it would be good as the quality and ingredients are, and just to be a bit positive, maybe I need to try some of their other menu items.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta

Jessica S.,"Mooresville, United States",39,24,8,3.0,8/7/2017,"We were in town for a weekend, going to a concert and the Aquarium. We stayed at the Le Meridian right next to this restaurant so it was super convenient and easy to walk to.  We were sat right away around 6:30. For us that's prime time dinner time, but this place wasn't super busy. About 8-10 tables were full.  We ordered drinks and then the guacamole and chips. The appetizer was really good. Sweet corn mixed with avocado and black bean salsa. They also brought out bread with herbs/spice mixed in EVOO. Delicious. Bread was soft and spice mix was really good as well.  My husband ordered the pepperoni pizza on thin crust, and I got the BBQ Chicken on Thin Crust. The pizzas were a lot larger than I expected!! They were delicious and so filling!!  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is our waiter was subpar. He disappeared for 15-20 mins at a time so our drinks did not get refilled in a timely fashion. And he had the personality of a wet sponge. We'd say thanks for something and he wouldn't even smile or acknowledge. Maybe he was just having an off day, but definitely not personable like I saw other wait staff being with their tables.  He also disappeared when we paid the tab for 10 mins which raised a red flag as to what he was doing with our card the whole time...we'll be keeping an eye on our account summary while in town.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta

They charged me extra for having two favors on one pizza. I also ordered the shishito peppers that was new on the menu and I actually loved it!

Hillary' E.,"Atlanta, United States",48,13,,1.0,26/12/2016,"I've been to this location a couple of times and service has been ok. Today, however, I had the worst dining experience I have ever had in my entire life. I went with my sister and my girlfriend at around 4 pm. My girlfriend's family is from Vietnam as are many of her friends. As we were walking to our table, my girlfriend was greeted by a Vietnamese lady whom my girlfriend knew because this lady is my girlfriend's friend's aunt. I thought to myself, since this lady knew my girlfriend, she was gonna be very nice and friendly to us but she was completely rude and racist.  She came over to my table and completely disregarded my sister and I. She only spoke to my girlfriend and only in Vietnamese. I did not even know she was asking what we would like to order because she literally only spoke to my girlfriend and only in Vietnamese. I asked the lady, whose name I later found out to be Mrs Hong, what flavor sweet teas they had and she rudely opened the menu and wavered her hand across the drinks section. I finally found the flavors for the sweet tea and asked for a raspberry one. She then asked my sister what she would like and she said she was going to share a drink with me. Mrs Hong rudely said we could not share a drink and proceeded to ask my girlfriend in Vietnamese where we are from. My girlfriend responded from Ecuador and Mrs Hong said ""that's why"" in Vietnamese.  I immediately wanted a new server but did not want to put my girlfriend in an uncomfortable situation. However, Mrs Hong continued to give me bad looks and disregard my presence every time she came around.  Food arrived when my girlfriend was in the restroom. She was sitting inside which made it uncomfortable for the server to put the plate down, so I offered to help put the plate down and Mrs Hong yanked the plate and refused my help.  After that, I had had enough. I asked for another server and she said OK.  New server came around and I thought that was the end of her rudeness, but I was wrong. She came to my table once again and handed my girlfriend a check, once again speaking in Vietnamese. She had given my girlfriend her very own separate check and had given her check a 25% off. She never asked if she was paying by herself, we always get one check. By this time I was fed up, so I was asking my girlfriend what this lady was saying because I did not understand. My girlfriend later told me Mrs Hong was telling her to not tell me anything.  That was the worst customer service I had ever experienced in my entire life. I asked Mrs Hong to call a manager. I was extremely angry at her rudeness, racism, and just lack of customer service to the point where I started crying. I had never before cried in a restaurant, I barely ever cry but that's how angry I was. I would not have cared if she had been all of that behind my back, but if you work in customer service, you have to fake niceness if you do not have a nice attitude. I have worked in restaurants, I've dealt with customers for about four years, I was a manager and customers have been horrible but never not even once have I acted the way this lady acted.  The manager was very apologetic and tried to make our visit right but there was nothing he could do. He took care of our order but we could not even finish our food out of anger. My sister was crying, my girlfriend was about to cry, and I could not help it but cry out of anger.  I am most likely never going back to this location and my advice to you is to ask for another server if you ever get Mrs Hong because my girlfriend told what happened to her friend and she explained that Mrs Hong is known for being racist.  I will definitely be taking this to corporate and I hope that their chain does not support racism and takes some action after this incident.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=20

Michael T.,"San Diego, United States",60,37,3,2.0,20/10/2016,"There are 2 major factors of how I feel about a dining experience: the food (obviously) and the customer service.  Food was overall good. Went for dinner and got a couple appetizers, salad, pizza, and a couple pastas. Spinach Artichoke dip with chips is always a go-to for me at CPK. No complaints here. BBQ Salad is always great, too. Still delicious as always. Pastas are good. Pizza was okay. Surprisingly, I feel like their pizza is their most mediocre food item they serve, despite their restaurant's name. This location's downfall is the customer service. The first person who greeted us and led us to our table seemed very disinterested and unenthusiastic. Our waitress really was bizarre. Way too casual, not at all professional. It seemed like she was digging into the depths of her soul to try to find her customer service self. Her service seemed forced and unnatural, hard to explain. Rarely anywhere to be seen, hard to talk to, and when she did come by our table, tried to take away food we weren't finished with yet. She wasn't necessarily rude, but she was definitely not friendly. At the end of our meal, she placed the check on our table and walked away - no words said. She spent most of her time chatting and hanging out with coworkers.  Her customer service ruined our experience. We felt like we were burdening her, and felt uncomfortable every time she came to our table.  Will not return to this location.

The flatbread was pretty tasteless.  Being that this is a new signature app I would have thought it would be much better.  Our salads and soup were as expected.

My friend had the avocado and bacon pizza, which she really likes.  I had the Kung Po pasta dish. I didn't enjoy it. I honestly think it has potential, but the dish was so overwhelmed by salt that it was a little too salty to eat. Couldn't even taste the flavor. However, I took it home, added some water into it and recooked it - absolutely yummy afterwards.  4. Setting: there's plenty of seating inside and outside.

This is the thing with eating at a chain; hopefully, the the level of ambiance and the food is consistent from one place to the next. Our server stopped by within a minute or two and brought us all water. Asked if we were interested in some bread, to which one of my companions eagerly said, ""Yes!"" We perused the menu and I settled on the Moroccan Chicken Salad. Before our food came out, another round of bread was enjoyed by all at the table. Didn't try the other guys' pizzas, but they looked good. One had a special order, which was accommodated and brought out with no mistakes. Good sign. My salad was the half size, but it was the perfect portion for lunch.

My point here is that the service was fine nothing amazing but it was average.    Everyone on my table order and I went last only because nothing I read felt that I was worth the suggested price.

When you're talking about almost $15 for a pie that might serve 1 or 2 people I kinda expect a really amazing pizza, but it doesn't have that ""I need to go there every week"" pizza quality you have with really nice pizza joints.  Blue Moon Pizza or Mellow Mushroom are def better options for a similar price.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=40

The aioli sauce that accompanies the appetizer is ranch IN hot sauce and its delish; I'm not a big fan of ranch. Now to the good part, We stuffed our faces with two different pizzas. One was the California Club which is a hand tossed pizza. It's not a thick pizza it's relatively thin about 10"" oh my goodness this is a yummy pizza especially if you're into salads. Not saying this is a salad pizza guys no no. Envision this pizza more like a sandwich club :) the applewood smoked bacon, roasted chicken and mozzarella is put in the oven first and after they top the pizza with avocado and lemon pepper mayo arugula. For our second pizza we had a crispy thin crust roasted artichoke with spinach + chicken which was about 11"". Your usual mozzarella and Parmesan with chucks of artichoke hearts, roasted garlic with sautéed spinach. Of course this pizza was extremely yummy! Oh and I added goat cheese to Both pizzas.

Gill B.,"Atlanta, United States",88,155,26,3.0,16/10/2014,"My summary of my experience at the CPK at Perimeter: middle of the road chain restaurant, not so stellar customer service, lovely setting.  I came with a large group of ten co-workers for a little birthday lunch in the middle of the work week. It was not very crowded on this particular Wednesday afternoon - a few groups of two or three here and there spread throughout the spacious restaurant. I like the atmosphere of the bright, open dining room with lots of windows. We were seated at a long table in a little elevated dining area with booths lining the walls, and two giant flat screen TVs positioned above on the wall airing the NFL Network on both of them (which I certainly appreciated as an avid football fan!). There is also a little patio area outside that had about 5 or 6 tables. I arrived a little bit late to the gathering with one of my co-workers, and promptly asked for a water when I sat down. The server seemed a bit distracted and neglected to bring it while she refilled teas and brought out second sodas to the rest of the party. I politely inquired again, and she apologized. Very sweet! They had a little table tent promoting their signature cocktails including mojitos - my weakness! I had no idea that they offer such an array of fun cocktails. If I were to come in for dinner (and not with the work group), I could certainly be enticed to try these out (and perhaps I would bump my rating up a star or two). I ordered the chicken chimichurri, and was impressed when our orders came out in about 15 minutes. Well, most of them did. The servers promptly delivered the fresh looking salads and pizza plates to their rightful diners, but there seemed to be a bit of confusion on two of the pizza orders. One of them came out a good 15 minutes after everyone else's, leaving the forgotten party member to scarf down his pizza long after everyone else had finished. This was a bit frustrating on a not-so-busy Wednesday lunch break when we all felt a bit rushed to get back to the office for meetings and email inbox control. The food was decent. I thought that the sauce was a little spicy, but the chicken was a good texture and the veggies were cooked just right. Satisfactory meal. The place gets a passing grade, but I was by no means blown away. There are so many great dining options in the Perimeter area, so this one can easily be overlooked.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=40
Steven G.,"Clarkston, United States",57,177,50,3.0,18/7/2014,"Good pizza, odd environment, ok service...3 stars is right.  I love pizza (who doesn't), and I like weird pizza and CPK is the place for odd/unique pizzas.  Great menu selections and different way varieties than what you would expect at your typical pizza joints.   Ok, so the food was great, no complaints there!  I had the thai-chicken pizza with thai-peanut sauce that is both spicy and savory.  It was awesome!  They pulled it off and ate every bite!  My wife loved her pizza, too.  Food is A+ The layout & vibe of the place is strange.  I felt like they were reaching for a semi-fancy sit down vibe, yet it didn't quite make it there.  LIMBO is the best way to describe it...somewhere between sit down fancy and casual.  There is an identity crisis going on and it confused me; not enough to scare me away but I had to scratch my head over it a few times.  Again, because of the weird limbo-thing the service is stuck between 2 worlds as well.  I felt like we got good service at times and just OK service at times.  I'm conflicted, yet again.  I want to go back (mainly for the food) and give this place another shot.  I think with an understanding of what to expect and maybe a different server that my opinion will change.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=60
Heidi P.,"Marietta, United States",806,491,1824,3.0,17/1/2014,"I have mixed feelings about CPK. Eaten here 2-3x and I can't tell if it is supposed to be fancy or not. I guess I always had it in my head that as far as chains it was a slightly more upscale pizza place. However everytime I go in there, my first thought is wow there are a lot of children in here.  It is like the food is a 3.5-4 but the atmosphere is 1.5-2. It is a large, pretty badly lit room with no walls. The sound is just all over the place and it feels more like a cafeteria than a restaurant. Pepperoni pizza pie just under $12 plus white truffle oil for over $1, chicken avocado spring rolls about $9, 6oz glass of wine 7.99, soda probably $2. For about $36 for 2 people, I think it is pretty good. But I would probably see it as a better value if there were less children. It brings it back to like a Chili's or TGI Friday level. Which is not terrible but super lacks excitement and uniqueness.  Very friendly wait staff, although the hostesses can work on their warmth and ffiendliness.

There are definitely better places to get pizza in the area, so this wouldn't be my first choice, but it isn't horrible.  We had two servers and they were both super attentive. One guy was training and I had to help him figure out how to use the pepper mill, but other than that they are very nice and accommodating. I got the spinach and artichoke thin crust. The crust was half crispy half floppy, but tasted good. I could tell based on taste that the spinach had been previously frozen and the artichokes came from a can. Two simple changes to using fresh ingredients would have definitely elevated the pizza. I personally think I can make better pizza at home.

It's another restaurant we don't have in the Northeast, so if I need a pizza fix and I'm traveling I know that they're reliable. On this visit I ordered the chicken quesadilla appetizer off the small tastes menu. At 5 dollars it was a great value. It was very tasty with a little spice and the side dipping sauce had some kick as well. The portion was tiny, but for five bucks you can't expect a huge portion. For my entree I tried the white pizza with applewood bacon added to it. The pizza was passable, although somewhat dry, it had decent flavor. I guess it's to be expected from a pizza without red sauce on it. In my opinion it needs some oil on the crust. My server was excellent, very attentive to my needs and quick to offer a refill on my soda.

The pizza rocked, but I think that wouldn't be something I would order a whole lot. I did try the passion fruit mojito and it was really good. Unfortunately, I could tell that two different bartenders made my two mojitos. The first one was way better that the second one. All in all and normal experience. We got exactly what you expect from CPK plus a little more because of the awesome service.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=80
Alan J.,"Atlanta, United States",4,27,7,2.0,11/5/2015,fast friendly service. that's about it. the California Club sandwich was mostly bread and didn't come with any sides. not even chips or a small anything else. definitely not worth $13.00.   I'm gonna need more value for my money.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=80
Mo G.,"Lawrenceville, United States",3,8,,1.0,10/3/2014,"This review is based on my experience, since I never got to try what I ordered since I walked out.  Ok... Where do I begin? When I first came into the restaurant, I was greeted promptly and seated. After that, it went downhill.  So my server was K (I can still be nice by not sharing his full name.... K will do.) It took K about 5 to 7 minutes to even greet us. Now I must say, I understand that servers get busy so I let it slide. By the time he came to greet us, we already knew what we wanted so we placed our order. I didn't know it took 5 minutes to just bring water with lemon, but who am I to judge? Maybe they have a well in the back of the restaurant? So he brings the water and bread to our table FINALLY. Then.... It was a game of Where's K? I kid you not.... I did not see K for about 20 minutes after he dropped off the water. Not only did he not give us straws for the glasses, he didn't even check on his customers! Why is it that I see servers around us frequenting their tables constantly? Ok.... So K then decides to check on us. I then ask him ""K, where have you been? We haven't seen you in a while."" His response is ""I have other tables and had orders to take."" I then respond back ""Ok, but we are your customers, too. You haven't checked in with us for about 20 minutes. We don't have straws and wanted more bread."" Instead of apologizing and remembering that the customer is always right (guess he wasn't trained on that) he tells me ""Well I had to take X amount of drink orders blah blah blah""... Sorry that I cannot remember the rest of the bull that crawled out of his mouth. He had a smirk on his face and an attitude that I definitely did not find acceptable if I'm paying MY money and part of YOUR pay. I then asked for the manager..... Manager comes. Shouldn't have even asked for him. Didn't resolve my disappointment, so we advised that they lost a customer, which I don't recall hearing a comment on. I understand it's your job to nod and agree to what I say, but please be aware that I deal with customer service on a daily basis. I know how frowns can be turned upside down and how to make customers happy from a bad experience.  So beware. If K is frequenting numerous tables, he will forget about you. That was the excuse I was given, just not in those terms. So sad because I was definitely hungry for a grilled chicken caesar sandwich. I took my business elsewhere and will never return! Remember the K!!!!!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=80
Katie W.,"Fourth Street, Louisville, United States",0,1,,1.0,6/6/2013,"The food was great but the service was not. Will not return due to our sever's apathetic and rude attitude. The service was very slow. The manager came over to our table to ask how everything was, and we told him that we had been waiting much longer than usual for our food. He checked the ticket time and confirmed that it was taking too long. Once the server found out that we had ""ratted her out"" she had a chip on her should and was rude to us. The manager discounted our meal and gave us free dessert, but the problem could have been better resolved with an apology and friendly service.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=80

Sterling L.,"Roswell, United States",616,161,21,4.0,16/8/2011,"California Pizza Kitchen has turned into one of my favorite chain restaurants. Our regulars are what keep us coming back. I love the Four Seasons Pizza and the one with Roasted Artichoke & Spinach. They also serve a great Thai crunch salad. This time we tried some of the newer items on the menu. The new Artichoke & Broccoli soup was just so-so, though. I wouldn't order it again. I found it a bit bland. The Strawberry Shortcake was pretty good though. Nothing fancy, just nice sweet, big ripe strawberries on a tasty pastry that wasn't exactly shortbread, but close enough.

R.c. K.,"Miami, United States",5,57,5,2.0,1/1/2013,"This is a good example of a chain restaurant ""phoning it in."" Nothing here was terribly bad, but just so mediocre. Service was ok...nothing bad, but nothing great either. My wife's pizza was very bland. Mine, which had every meat imaginable, was very short on cheese. You know how low-end pizza is missing about an inch of cheese between the main area and the crust? Well, that happened here. Also, when I pay $14 for an individual pizza, it better be stacked with meat. This one was not. I had about 5 pieces of sausage on two slices, but had a hard time finding the sausage on the other slices. The entire pizza had only 1 piece of salami. I think the food prep people are just working too fast and not paying attention to preparing a pizza carefully. I would forgive a place that sold $5 pizza. I cannot ignore this on a $14 pizza.

Chantel W.,"Bay Area, United States",61,64,33,2.0,10/10/2014,"I normally order my food to go from this location and it's always quick and easy (and good).  Since we had a little extra time, we decided to dine in.  Bad choice.  While it was lunch time, it wasn't as crowded as I expected, but, the service we received was horrible.  Our server, Darold, forgot about us several times and we started to believe it was purposely.  He'd walk by looking up or in another direction as if he was trying to avoid us.  The table next to us had the same experience.  The food was good, as usual, but, I can only hope this was just a bad day for service.  When we finished, we sat with our cash and credit cards on the table for about 10 minutes as we tried to flag him down.  Another waitress who noticed us finally yelled across to him and said ""These ladies need something"".  He came with our bills, took mine (which was cash) and didn't ask if I wanted change.  Of course, I did.  I wasn't planning on leaving a large tip for that service.  We waited, he returned my friends cards and receipts and ran off, we waited for the return of my change...it never came.  We left, since we were now running late due to his delays.  I left feeling like he had stolen from me.  It's dramatic, I know, but, given his service, I can't believe he would think I'd leave a 30% tip.  And the nerve to not even apologize...and assume I didn't want change.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=100

I've been to several over the years and this is the first one I've gone to one in Atlanta. I'll have to say, the service here and the staff as well as the place itself is one of the better CPKs that I've been to. Our waiter was courteous and even checked in a few times after we got our food to make sure we were satisfied. I usually get the bbq chicken pizza on honey wheat bread but this time i got Hawaiian bbq chicken pizza on honey wheat (the same but with pineapples) and it was just as good. My fiance got the jambalaya and we both finished our entrees and were more than happy with our meals.  Overall I thought the service was great - very prompt. And our food came with no delay even though we didn't order appetizers.

I was absolutely starving...starving to the point of gnawing my hand off...to the point of snapping at any point if even asked a question. Then solution...or so I thought...CPK! Then I hastily placed my order & scurried over there for my pick up excited for what was to come. Only to 1st be disappointed at how incredible tiny the pizza's were for the price I was paying. Then I get home & think to myself...ok I'm starving so anything should taste good at this point right? WRONG! The Hand tossed pizza which I mistakenly made half & half (for an extra $2 might I add) was crazy BAD. The pepperoni & cheese tasted cheap and the bread was flavorless. The Hawaiian BBQ Chicken literally tasted like dog food....or what I imagine Dog Food would taste like. I literally turned to my boyfriend and said ""OMG I think someone chewed this already & put it back on the pizza. The margherita thin crust...which looked amazing online...certainly lacked taste & imagination. So in summary...NEVER eating at CPK again.

They have a large lunch crowd and we only waited about 10 minutes to be seated. We were promptly greeted by our server almost instantly and she was pretty good about recommending some new items and she was attentive. Their chop salad is by far one of the best in town and adding barbecue chicken makes it extra good (I recommend that you hold the peas, though).  I wish that they made a smaller portion of the salad that could be eaten with pizza.  We ordered salads plus I wanted pizza, but by the time it got to the table I was already full and didn't enjoy it as much as I could have.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-atlanta?start=100

I am a picky eater and we got the Avocado Egg Rolls for an app, they were delicious!!! I ordered the Chopped salad and the dressing was amazing. The salad is not worth the price you pay, I am not a big fan of the salami being shredded on the salad. At the end of our meal she suggested a dessert to me because I told her that this was my first CPK experience, I really liked that she went out of her way to point out what her favorites were. When we got the tab, she charged me for that Diet Pepsi that I never received, which I just took out of what I would have tipped her. Little mistakes like that can ruin a near perfect experience.
