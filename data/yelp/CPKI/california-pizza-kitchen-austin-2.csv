Paul P.,"Round Rock, TX",47,33,71,4.0,1/1/2018,"We have eaten at this little restaurant several times when we go to the Domaine and I decided it was time to make the time for a review. We were disappointed that they have removed hummus from the menu, but their delicious bread and olive oil quickly made us forget about it. We substituted or normal request fro hummus for their Tortilla Spring Rolls for an appetizer. We chose the Mediterranean nd Baja Chicken. Both were good, but I'll pass next time on the marinara sauce that comes with them. The guacamole that accompanied them was very fresh and delicious. I had Sicilian pizza and I really liked the thin crust. The Italian sausage was very good as well as the other meats and ingredients. We enjoyed a glass of La Crema Pinot Noir and Mark West Pinot Noir with our meal. We will keep going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2
Sandra S.,"Austin, TX",146,159,877,2.0,12/30/2017,"What a disappointing visit from start to finish :/ Our uninterested hostess sat us at a table right under an ac vent so we never took off our coats.  We mentioned it to the waiter and he simply said oh i didn't notice.  I asked for a sample of sauvignon blanc and the bf wanted some hot tea.  The waiter came back and said they were out of the label i asked for and brought teas for bf to choose from.  I ordered a different wine and bf picked his tea.  We ordered our pizza and salad and asked for no sausage since i don't like it.  No problem.  After more than enough time i got my glass of wine and our waiter comes back with a cup with a rather large cup on the rim and says all their mugs are dirty so would he mind using the mug with the chip on the rim.  If not,  he says he could hand wash a mug for him.  REALLY? ?????????? THAT MUG BELONGED IN THE TRASH!!!  Why would they even offer that as an option? ??? So BF says that's ok I'll just have water.   We get our salad pizza and bread ALL at the same time,  what's the point of bringing bread if it comes at the same time as the pizza? Oh and BTW they sure did put the sausage on the pizza that we asked to take off. Ugh. After we started eating the waiter comes after we're about on our second piece and says how's everything?  Can we get some parmesan and also we asked for no sausage.  Oh sorry!   What a terrible experience.  It feels like what used to be a borderline upscale restaurant has turned into a second rate cutting corners place. I've been to this location and others in San Antonio and Vegas and never experienced anything like this.  Not feeling it,  probably not coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2
Danni M.,"Granbury, TX",227,6,3,5.0,1/5/2018,Employees are so sweet. I didnt dine in but i got a Togo order. Everyone approached me to check on me. I'm not sure if it's suppose to be team service but i enjoyed being acknowledged by everyone for the 15 minutes i was there. 15 minutes includes me being indecisive and them getting my pizza out. Also. Best pizza. Hands down.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2
Sarah L.,"Austin, TX",242,74,207,2.0,12/7/2017,"I knew this was a chain, so i thought cpk would be quick and an inexpensive meal. But CPK is overpriced pizza and I happenedd to order the cpk club which included avocado, shredded lettuce, and bacon. The pizza was your average one but I think the thing i regret the most is that this pizza was something i could clearly make at home if I had chosen to do so. Not only was the pizza very bland and not special but it was a whopping $16! Def would not recommend when there are other places nearby",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2

They ended up being about $15-$16 each. The service was pretty good, except they were a bit pushy trying to upsell us on appetizers, drinks, and desserts.

Kanika B.,"West Campus, Austin, TX",283,27,98,4.0,12/12/2017,Came here during lunch for the first time and got to try their lunch duo! I got the Chicken Meatball Piadina and Sedona Tortilla Soup. It was about $10 and you really can't beat the price. You get half a piadina and a smaller bowl of soup. The food was good and the waiter was kind. The restaurant wasn't packed either.

Tanya G.,"Austin, TX",50,6,5,1.0,11/29/2017,"In August I held a fundraiser at California Pizza Kitchen under the pretext that a percentage of meals would be donated back to my non profit.  During the event there were many displays of ""hospitality"", and ""customer service"" so I wrote reviews, positive emails etc. Boy was I fooled! It's now 2 days from December and all the promises are faded, I've had to beg for follow through, and now, apparently no one is responding anymore AND, still no payment for our fundraiser. How is this OK? How is it legal? Can't believe a business operates this way. My non profit has received grants and other funding for much higher amounts, way less drama and frustration, and full follow through.

Rini S.,"Denver, CO",238,157,220,4.0,6/6/2017,"Pesto Cream Penne. That's all I have to say. It's so good!! California Pizza Kitchen is a well known restaurant chain and this food made it clear why they've lasted and been able to expand. I cannot put into words how delicious this pasta was.  The waiters were super nice, the wait wasn't too long and I had plenty of leftovers which tasted amazing once I heated it up in a pan. I personally won't come back because I love trying new places but I will definitely recommend this place and that amazing pasta to people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2
Cindy Y.,"Pearland, TX",14,65,132,2.0,4/26/2017,"Quite disappointed with this place. To start off we arrived around 4:30 (a party of 4). No rush at all, passed the lunch rush and not quite dinner time yet. So the restaurant was not busy at all. There were at least 6 people I saw scurrying around and only our booth and a lady at the bar (who arrived after us). We walked in. Got seated and we waited...and waited. We didn't even get our menus for a very long time. I had to raise my hand and wave it in the air like I was back in elementary school waiting my turn to be called on by the teacher. Let me add, this trend did not stop.  I was finally able to hail someone down to ask for the menus. The waitress took our drink order but I guess she misheard me; gave me lemon with my water when I explicitly said, no lemon. We were given bread...which was pretty stale. It was so tough it could chip a tooth. Was able to hail someone down again to take our order.  They were kind enough to give us a complimentary white corn guac and chips for it being our first time there (probably an apology for the terrible beginning service, but I don't know). The corn was good; sweet, but it was not a ""dip"" or ""guac"" in any way. It just had chunks of avocado, a lot of white corn, and some chunks of chile. It was more like a topping than a dip. Difficult to scoop and eat. Wasn't super special. Just eating corn and corn chips.  Shrimp scampi zucchini By description this would've been something I should love. Love white wine sauce. Love zucchini. Love shrimp. It was terribly executed though. The wine caused the zucchini to pickle and it became really really sour. The zucchini was inedible. There was a decent amount of shrimp, I give that, but the star of the dish was the zucchini so 3/4th of the dish was trashed.  We asked for more bread and she stated that they are currently making more and that the first one we got was the last one (no wonder it was stale).  We told the waitress that we were in a rush and she still took forever with everything she did. I don't understand why an empty restaurant with multiple employees can't work together to serve the two parties in the building.  Took forever to give us the check and a to go box. Overall, the food I got was terrible. I give them the benefit of the doubt that it is a pizza place and that's what you should order. The pizza looked good so my advice is go for the pizza not the pasta. But the service was brutal too though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2
Hannah P.,"Pflugerville, TX",176,310,1137,2.0,7/14/2017,"I don't think I will be back here. I never realized how over rated this place is. With all the new businesses opening up, I don't know how long CPK will stay in business?? Prices are quite high for little portions. There are many competitors out there so I hope CPK can keep up with their marketing and have specials or something. Everyone has there opinions though (which I do) and unfortunately I'm not a big fan of this place. Pizza was ok and the scampi was very bland. On a different note, we had great service! A bit slow near the end but realized he seem to be doing so much work - including taking care of to-go orders . Two entrees, two drinks, and a kids entree- $75.. hmm",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2
Brett J.,"Pflugerville, TX",184,198,591,3.0,6/12/2017,"So only had a cheese pizza... however it was very good! The crust was the way I like it... crunchy on the outside with a bit of chewy on the inside. The wait staff was Johnny on the spot addressing all of our wants... though they were few. Seemed like there was a good menu... lots of selections including some artisan drinks. However I do remember thinking that I wanted an appetizer and not being able to find anything that my son's would eat. They are 8 and 3 and although not picky I don't think they are ready for the California Kitchen menu selections. I was quite intrigued by their sangria selections... My wife ordered one of the sangrias and it was pretty good! (There were 5 types to choose from) The restaurant itself was clean and neat but for this day and age a little dull... it just was kind of like a diner. Nothing popped about the place and really gave off a ho hum vibe. Maybe it was the time of day... but it just felt really quite boring. This is somewhere I might take my boys again (although thank goodness for cheese pizza as I don't think much else would trip their triggers)... but I would probably not take my wife here on a date night. There are so many choices here in the Domain that offer it all... ambiance, food, and service... the California pizza kitchen fell a bit short. Worthy of a honorable mention... but certainly no prize.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2
Maria K.,"Austin, TX",28,103,137,4.0,1/6/2017,"This is a great spot for a quick lunch that won't break the bank like most places in the Domain. It tends to get quite busy and since it's not very big there can be a wait. I will say the could use some refinement when it comes to how they address the waiting list. They are on the old school pen /paper and yell your name. They should offer to text you when your table is ready. It would help especially if it's a 30 minute wait you can hop next door to Macy and what not.  That being said I must tell you about their drinks which are down right tasty! Yes I know I said it's a solid spot for a quick lunch but it's also a solid option for a drink! I highly recommend the Apple Berry Sangria!! I will say CPK does get a little too generous on the ice that comes inside my sangria so maybe ask them for 1/2 the ice to assure you get a full pour of the tasty tasty!! As for food I enjoy the small plates, the asparagus arugula salad is top notch and it's filling for being so cheap!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2
Jinsl J.,"Austin, TX",199,50,37,5.0,4/3/2017,"Always a good option. CPK (California Pizza Kitchen) never fails me; their chipotle chicken pizza and kung pao spaghetti are my favorite. They have a twist on the classic Italian dishes, but I would describe the place as more Italian with an American twist. Not too expensive so it'a a good place to go out for a casual dinner if you're looking for something nicer than fast food. Also their mango tea is a must, so order that instead of your regular sodas or water.  For portion sizes, the pizza is pretty big and really filling; I usually take some of it in a to-go box cause I cant finish it. The spaghettis aren't as big of portions but it's enough to satiate your hunger! I'm a die hard fan of CPK so my review might be a little biased but I would really recommend if you need diverse types of dishes for a nicer- than-fast food meal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2
Kris U.,"Austin, TX",509,903,859,4.0,8/2/2016,"CPK is one of my long time favorite workday lunch places.  Now, it's even better with the introduction of the ""combo lunch"".  You can essentially pick two from their sandwich / pizza / salad / soup combo selection; there are less choices than the full menu and everything is  lunch portion sized, but it works well for me!   Pro Tip: the Mediterranean salad comes light oil-based dressing, but you can ask for a side of any dressing you prefer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2
Peter C.,"Austin, TX",9,28,33,2.0,4/9/2017,"Service is variable but generally good. If they have a trainee then don't expect to many visits or drink refills. Pizzas quality seems to be going thru a tweaking process , dough does not go to the edge of the pan, the toppings are about five of each ingredient. Looks like an accountant was standing next to the chef and handing him the items while building the pizza. The taste was good but there was a lot of grease on the Sicilian pizza. Waite rests took my plate while I had a slice of pizza in my hand! The restaurant was during the afternoon and virtually at 20% capacity. No reason to hurry me along I thought to myself. It was Aquarius since I had to ask for a napkin so I could lay my slice down to take a drink.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2

The portions are quite big and I like that they are happy to sub whole wheat pasta if you so desire. We came in during the day and there were sooooo many people, but somehow we were seated within 10 minutes.  The service is nice and the food came out pretty quickly.

While waiting I looked around and counted 16 empty tables. I asked hostess, why the wait with empty tables? She said it was to rotate the customers between the servers so as to not overload them. If that's the case hire more servers or more efficient  ones! The only time you should wait is when the restaurant is 95-100% full. Now the food... do they have a new manager and all new kitchen staff? The salad I ordered, Thai Crunch, seemed different. Smaller and soaked in the peanut dressing.

Robert B.,"Houston, TX",42,419,809,3.0,11/6/2014,Good service.  Good location So I have been to California Pizza Kitchens before. Nothing really crazy or exceptional to write about.  The pizza options are vast. But nothing really stands out over another.  To put it to you this way I just always have the server pick my food.  The location in Austin is by far the nicest and least busy I have ever been too which in both aspects is great.  I had the Thai chicken pizza.  Really the only this that's actually rememberable is the freshness and softness of the dough/crust. To me that's very likable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2?start=40

Joyce Z.,"Austin, TX",49,109,201,4.0,2/19/2015,"WHAT!!! I don't know why CPK has only 3 stars on Yelp because I love this place! It's my go-to lunch or dinner spot whenever I come to the Domain for shopping. I have never had a bad service experience here and the food is always up to par. Sure it isn't the best pizza I have ever had, but I think for the price, this is a pretty good meal!  I love getting the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Pizza and the California Club! Their BBQ Chicken pizza is the best!!! I love the tangy BBQ sauce combined with the chicken, and if you get the Hawaiian version the pineapple just adds that extra blast of sweetness! The California club looks like they just dumped a salad on your pizza but it is actually pretty good! It has lettuce, avocado, and pieces of chicken and bacon on top! They also used to have a veggie pizza with eggplant which I don't know if they still have, and it is a great choice for all you veggie lovers.  As for the pastas, my go-to is the Pesto Penne! It is absolutely delicious with the sun-dried tomatoes and shrimp! I have also had the Cajun pasta and it is good as well for those of you who are craving something a little spicy.  For the salads, I love the pear Gorgonzola one, but I don't know if they still have it on the menu cuz I haven't ordered it in a while. The caramelized peach one is also good!  I wouldn't recommend getting any appetizers because I feel that they are overpriced and not worth it.

Harley G.,"San Diego, CA",0,135,26,5.0,11/6/2015,"This eatery is located within a shopping mall. The eatery itself has an outside patio and looks welcoming as you walk up to the establishment.

The order was taken, reconfirmed and provided the water I ordered right away. The food arrived within twenty minutes after placing the order. Having visited previously, the food looked wonderful and tasty once again. Anytime that food looks tasty before a bite, you usually will enjoy your meal. This was no exception. The ordered sandwich was a California Club with chicken and a side of Cesar salad. Everything within the meal tasted fresh, had plenty of flavor and was well and patiently made. I enjoyed my meal.

Me and my girlfriend split a pizza (yields 3 slices each, but slices were a good size) her half Hawaiian w/ pineapple and ham and my half I got roasted garlic chicken.   I thought the pizza was good it was thin sliced bread and my particular pizza didn't have tomato sauce which was great.

I think people are a little harsher on rating chains like this to the point where they are sort of punishing them for being a chain instead of some local unique creative out of this world food experience. While I do like trying new local places, this is one of those places you always know what to expect and it fits a variety of different palates so it's good to go to if you're having trouble coming to consensus on dinner plans.  I think their drink menu is especially good with lots of tasty fruity drinks and frozen drinks to choose from which I'm all about.

I don't know just weird, but it is good. Enjoy the pizza here, there is nothing to not love about the pizza. The Honey Wheat Crust is a specialty that you must try as well. The ingredients always seem so fresh as well. The desserts are delicious, save room for the butter cake and ice cream. Seasonal special, strawberry shortcake is out of this world, wish it was around all year. I wish they would have it all the time. I really just come here a lot for the seasonal dessert otherwise I am not a frequent goer. The staff is ok, some of them are really good, and some of them leave you hanging though.

They have many gluten free options and the gluten free pizza is pretty good.  I do find the service helping me when I am picking up a to go order is better than the service I get at a table. I don't know of the to go people are just happier or what but when I go to the to go bar they smile, greet, make sure I have everything and if there is someone in front of me a person will come around to get my name and make sure my order is ready when I get up there.

Amanda W.,"Austin, TX",134,315,297,4.0,8/12/2014,I actually really like cpk. My favorite pizzas are the bbq chicken and the chipotle chicken. The mushroom and pepperoni is good as well and i think it kind of tastes like homeslices. I love their mac and cheese for kids too because its actually pretty filling and comforting. I think the lack of good ratings is because its a chain and it is pretty pricey for how small the pizza is. One pizza can feed one or two people. The thai chicken one is worth trying as well!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2?start=40

When I paid my bill I was watching them having issues with my Credit Card, they came brought me my bill and did not mention that anything was wrong with the transaction. I just assumed they were having issues swiping my card because it does that sometimes. But the next day I have two charges on my Card from California Pizza. Once for almost twice the original amount. I understand accidents happen but they could have told me. It appeared the waiter called on for help from a man with normal clothes on. I assumed a manager of some sort. This person should have came and apologized for charging my card twice. Then all would be well on my side because accidents happen. So this was a horrible trip, doubt I'd ever eat there again.

Walking in, it felt like I was walking in to an old Denny's off the side of the highway. A little... no, a lot, less pleasing atmosphere compared to other restaurants at the domain with the same price point. Also, the menu was weird, the focal point on the menu seemed to be dishes other than pizza... you would think their pizzas would be what they put on display, but I guess I was wrong. My friend got a drink and dessert. I had the guacamole (which wasn't good). Presentation was nice, but that's it. I had a pizza (which was twice as much as a frozen pizza at HEB or Target). Pizza was good, but that was it. If I ever decide to try another pizza, I'll check the frozen section at HEB first. If they don't have it, I'll just go without.  P.s. my friend said her drink wasn't good. There was no alcohol in it! And her drink and cake totaled to just as much as my pizza and guac.

Erin A.,"Austin, TX",225,142,506,3.0,3/31/2016,"Honestly speaking- for the price of the food. My experience was just okay. If you're not up to paying ~$20, get a pizza and share with another friend and split the cost. This place is called ""California Pizza Kitchen"" so maybe that was a better choice. Atmosphere: It feels really casual and clean in here and I felt super at comfort. I walked in and felt like I could stay for a long time without feeling like I had to leave as soon as possible. It was pretty quiet and welcoming. Service: Our waiter was actually very kind and did all he can to communicate with us. He did seem busy even with the restaurant being really empty.  Time: The food took way to long to make its way to the table. I came in a group of 6 (including myself)- which really isn't too big of a group. But I feel like after we put our orders in, we were sort of forgotten. Even the bread they normally bring out took a long time. Food: The bread came out warm and it was crispier on its sides. We had to ask for another side of the bread because they only brought one dish to our table when we had 6 people. I ordered the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine which was pretty good initially/ at first bites. Later it got really really salty and I drank multiple cups of water. There was a lot less chicken pieces than I imagined and the serving size wasn't as big as I thought. For the price, it was alright (not a problem, but not an absolute wow either).  It's definitely nice coming at least once but I'm not too sure if I'll be visiting again/ frequently. I feel like I paid for what I got- I just feel a lot more satisfied when I get a W O W experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2?start=20

With pizza in the name you would think their pizza would be on point. But you have a 50/50 shot of getting a soggy pizza that has been sitting in grease. Slice after slight a puddle of grease is usually revealed on the plate. However, when the plate is grease free the pizza is somewhat enjoyable.  The truth is this isn't a restaurant you just choose to go to. You are out at the domain, and almost every other restaurant is filled with people, so you settle.

Chris M.,"Austin, TX",4977,535,2556,5.0,3/14/2011,"CPK is typically a 3.5 to 4.5 star experience (IMO).  I discovered them over 10 years ago, in California, while on business, when I requested we go out to lunch at some nice kitchen, in Cali, that makes really good pizza and salads.  Hence, I was introduced to CPK.   Over the years I have frequented this chain, love their Thai Chicken Pizza (my fave).  Unfortunately I felt over over time that their quality took a slight dip (overall), with food, portion sizing, and customer service.   Last weekend I was at the Domain, exhausted from furniture shopping, and slightly hungry.  I had a good experience at this CPK a couple of years ago, it's time for a repeat.  I wasn't too hungry, so my mind wasn't set on eating here, I figured I would check out the menu and see if anything tugged at my waistline...and if not then it's time to bounce.  Enter Bartender Nancy, who was professional and prompt with her greeting.  She proceeded to go over several of the new small menu items and was a suggestive selling queen.  The new Korean BBQ tacos caught my eye, but Nancy highly recommended the Chicken Tinga Quesadilla.  She told me that the Korean tacos were very good, but they're very small - - just an FYI - - we wouldn't want to get your hopes up.  Alright - let's try both.  I'm so glad for Nancy's feedback because she was right on.  The quesadillas were very good, love the southwest sauce.  The Korean BBQ tacos were small as hell - - I mean I was picturing Chi'Lantro tacos, but these literally fit in the palm of your hand.  Full of flavor, though but maybe not worth $6.  And here comes the next Bartender Alicia, it's a shift change at CPK.  She watches me take pics of my food and is curious, asks me WTF are you doing?  Enter my Yelp plugs as I suggestively sell this website about ""Real People Real Reveiws"" to her like there's no tomorrow.  She digs comfort food and will start utilizing Yelp to help find her picks.  She was busy taking inventory of the liquor but still was able to provide excellent service and support with a smile.  Nancy and Alicia - - they run the bar at CPK in Domain, stop in and they'll take care of ya, and load up on those quesadillas and korean tacos.  Their excellent and friendly customer service and skills bumped this up to a 5 star experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2?start=60

Karol M.,"Austin, TX",343,413,575,3.0,3/20/2012,"This is the storefront for the corresponding yellow pizza boxes in my grocer's freezer.  It's a bright and cheery-looking place, and I love all things California (except crowds and high prices), so I was expecting something fairly interesting. What I wasn't expecting was to stand around quite so long for a table.  The place was crowded with a wait on a weekend afternoon, mostly with families with young children.  My group was seated by a trendy, slumpy young woman who mumbled something unintelligible as she set down our menus (no silverware or drinks, either), and we waited around some more for our server to finally show up, and even longer for food and silverware (in that order, and we had to hunt her down and actually ask her to bring napkins and forks while our food sat there waiting patiently...more patiently than we were, by this point.) In a pizza kitchen, naturally you'd want to order the pizza, and naturally you'd expect to share it.  With the prices especially, you'd think that a 10"" pizza would feed at least two people.  Our server informed us with disdain that we weren't ordering enough food, that she regularly ate one by herself.  She must have weighed all of 100 lbs, so I thought maybe she just burned off all those calories.  We ordered a 10"" pizza for every two people, and side salads off the appetizer menu.  I didn't see any larger pizzas offered. Turns out, she was right.  Their 10"" pizzas are thin, and our toppings were partially burned, so we ended up picking some of them off.  The salads were tasty but also small.  We were still hungry at the end of our meal, but it was so loud in there and the service took so long, that we just wanted to exit and move on with our day. From the look of the menu and the stylish interior, the dining experience here should be better than it was.  But for now, I'll stick with an occasional yellow California pizza box from the freezer section.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2?start=80

We ordered the Original BBQ Pizza & I ordered a raspberry tea. When I took a sip of the tea, I was surprised at how bitter it was so I asked for sugar & lemon. As we waited for our pizza, we looked around & notice that EVERY table had bread & olive oil in front of them as they waited as well. I looked over at another young couple who got there a little after us and they had some too! We questioned this to ourselves, but let it go since our pizza came out kind of fast. We finished it in like five minutes because it was literally the BEST pizza I've ever had, and I've had a lot of pizzas. We ordered another of course. As we waited, she came around with two plates of bread. One with olive oil & one without, she handed us the plate without the olive oil.

I don't know if maybe you have to pay for the bread or whatever, or maybe since we looked super young & dressed in work out clothes and beanies that maybe we looked broke or misplaced or whatever, but we were treated differently than her other costumers which for me being a waitress myself, definitely brought her tip down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2?start=80

I notice that their website actually has a special menu, which you can also request if you go there, which lists exactly what you can order if you are vegetarian, vegan, or gluten free.  I was very excited about this.  I looked it up in advance and figured out what I wanted to order.  I ordered the vegetable lettuce wraps, and the California Veggie Pizza (thin crust, no cheese).  Our waitress was skeptical that I could order the lettuce wraps vegan, and double checked with the kitchen, even though I insisted that it said I could on the website.  But I appreciate that she was thorough and cautious.  The appetizer came out at the same time as the entrees, and they immediately comped us for the price of it.   The lettuce wraps were quite good.  I had them bring me some limes that I could squeeze on them, and that made them extra tasty.  I do think I still like PF Chang's lettuce wraps just a bit more. I have to admit, I had my reservations about the pizza.  To start with, I'm not the biggest fan of thin crust pizza.  The eggplant, mushrooms, and sun-dried tomatoes sounded pretty good, but the broccoli, corn, and purple onions sounded a little weird.  Ultimately, it was pretty good.  I'm very curious to try the wild mushroom pizza, but the menu confuses me a little.  It says ""all veggies are ok"" for vegans, but it only specifically suggests ordering the California Veggie pizza.   Ultimately, the ambiance was nice, there was very little wait time, the service was great, and the menu has a wide variety of appealing options that I'd like to try.  I'll probably go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2?start=80

I sat with an empty glass of water most of the time I was there. I even resorted to slurping the last of the ice out of the glass, which brought looks from the folks behind the counter/bar, but still no water. Granted, we stayed and visited for quite a while, but they were NOT busy, so what difference did that make? Does my meal come with an allotted time limit? And there must have been a shift change somewhere along the way, because our waitress left, and we were consequently completely ignored for the rest of the visit.  It was not like we just came in and ordered a drink and gabbed for hours. We all ordered meals, and the bill was not cheap. The food did not impress me. It was okay, but had a very 'chain restaurant' out of a freezer quality to it. I thought it was way overpriced from a price-to-quality ratio standpoint.

She had just fallen asleep and I knew I'd have the perfect amount of time to eat before doing some more shopping. Was seated at a nice table with room for the stroller. Then I was ignored by my waiter. I had to wave someone down and tell them that no one had been by my table. A waitress arrived to tell me she wasn't my waiter/waitress but she'd help me out. Then my waiter showed up and asked if I had been waiting long, I said yes. He acted like he didn't hear me and asked me again, I again responded yes. He took my drink and food order - a salad with chicken. 20 minutes passed. No food. Waiter stopped by and expressed concern that my food had not arrived. 5 minutes later, he told me there was a mix up in the kitchen and it would be 5 more min. The first waitress came by again because she saw how long I had been there. She asked if I was doing alright. I told her I still hasn't received my food and she offered to go check on it. More than 10 min later, my food finally arrived. I ate half of it but then my daughter woke up and wanted to be held. The waiter returned and asked how it was. I said good. He said worth the wait? I said no (honestly). At no point did a manager approach me. I expected waiter to tell a manager about the issues and i definitely think my food should have been comped. I even told the waiter that the people next to me had arrived 15 min after I ordered and they still got their food before I did. He seemed annoyed and said ...

All of the high end shops are buzzing and complimentary horse and buggy rides are free flowing.

It is simply a description of a perfectly suitable activity for adults who are no longer able or too unsavvy to navigate Downtown Austin but still have enough of a pulse to want to leave the house for a drink and some chow now and then.  We had the Pear and Gorgonzola pizza with a starter of spinach dip and another large salad with a Moroccan theme (read: meat and fruit with some spices). It was all good and heavily marked up. Maybe the dip was a little too watery. But hey, it's bright, festive and the waitstaff is family friendly. They will even offer you half a glass of wine if you're nervous about what you may spend in the Apple Store afterward.

Catherine T.,"Austin, TX",539,410,1438,3.0,8/24/2010,"Keri B, Darla A and I ended up here after the Cupcake Smackdown on Saturday.  They wanted food; I really just wanted alcohol.  Sheesh... I probably shouldn't admit to being such a lush on a public site. Anyway, they were crowded, but we got seated within ten minutes.  This is where the service can take a flying, painful leap off the Empire State Building.  We sat there for about ten minutes with no attention at all.  Just as I was about to suggest getting up and going elsewhere, our waiter finally showed his face.  I don't think he even introduced himself, so I'll just call him Vern. I ordered a raspberry mojito, but was sorely disappointed with it.  It was extremely watered down.  I wondered just how long my drink waited at the bar before Vern brought it to me.  Was there really raspberry in there?  I couldn't taste it.  How about rum?  Couldn't taste that, either.  All I could taste was mint and water.  CPK, you have officially come in last place on my Mojito list. So Keri ordered the spinach artichoke pizza, and Darla got... what did Darla get?  Oh yeah, the Tuscan panzanella salad, and the Korean bbq tacos.  Pizza does terrible things to my blood sugar, so I only eat it once per month, and I've already had some this month.  Also, everything on the menu seemed overpriced, so I ordered the $4.99 asparagus and arugula salad. Our food came out in due time, and Keri gave me a slice of her pizza.  I figured one slice wouldn't hurt my blood sugar so much.  The pizza was outstanding.  Thing is, it took me about 15 minutes to eat that one slice.  I still had half of it left, and I hadn't even touched my salad, and I looked over at Keri's plate to see she'd finished more than half her pizza.  And Darla was well on her way to finishing her food, as well.  Darla clued me in.  She said I'd been doing the most talking.  I need to learn how to let other people talk, I guess, so my food won't get cold. As far as the salad, I didn't like the lemon herb vinaigrette dressing at all.  The parmesan was in huge crumbly slices, so it was hard to get it on my fork.  I'm not the biggest arugula fan, but I ate it like a good girl should.  The asparagus was steamed, and tasted as good as it should.  Full disclosure:  I hated asparagus growing up.  See, my mother would make it in such a way (boiling it, maybe?) that the asparagus would get soggy and mushy.  As a result, I would take one bite, and would immediately have to excuse myself to the bathroom to puke.  A few years ago, I decided to try it again at Eddie V's.  It was steamed, and I therefore quickly developed a taste for it.  Don't think my mother is a bad cook.  She's not; she just can't cook asparagus properly to save her life. Anyway, I have to interrupt this review with another service diatribe.  Keri ran out of water just as a manager walked up to our table to ask how everything was.  Keri asked for more water, and the manager (whom I'll call Ernest) said he'd get it.  We completely finished our meals, but poor Keri still did not have her water.  The pitchers were sitting right there at the end of the counter, so Keri got up to fill her own glass.  That's when Vern intercepted her and filled it.  Inexcusable that Ernest was right by the water pitcher, yet his California Pizza Self couldn't be bothered to get it.  Either that, or he desperately needs to do some memory exercises. And it doesn't end there, folks.  We got our bill, gathered up money (Darla and I paid cash, and Keri put in a credit card), but Vern never came back to pick up the check.  He passed by several times, and Keri waved the check folder around right in front of his face, but he didn't notice.  That's when she took back her credit card and put in cash instead, so we could get the hell out of there.  As a result of me and Keri needing change but not wanting to wait around, Vern lucked out and got a much bigger tip than he deserved.  Of course, Vern noticed us and our check folder as soon as we got up to leave.  Way to go, Vern! Look, Vern, I know you guys were busy that day, but if you can't handle all the tables in your section, then you should either ask for help or find another line of work.  Hell, you didn't even have a sense of urgency at all.  You fail at Waiting Tables 101.  Know what I mean, Vern?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2?start=120

But this is one of those places that is special - because face it, where else are you going to find a Chinese broccoli/eggplant/sun-dried tomato/goat cheese pizza? Not everywhere, I can tell you that! CPK is one of those places where you can either pig out and 'grease your wheels,' so to speak...or actually have a relatively healthy dining experience! Something pleasant about chains is that they are typically consistent. CPK is certainly in that category for me. I can always count on CPK to provide a thoroughly satisfying dinner salad (the Waldorf Chicken Salad, vinaigrette dressing - light - and no celery) or a generous and filling pizza which will tucker out your taste buds midway through (yay left-overs!). My only complaint is that - being a pizza joint, this place is typically packed with rowdy kiddos. Parents, please. Kids are fabulous, I know - but this isn't Chuck E. Cheese! Please keep them in their seats. Also, I really wish they'd bring back two of my old favorites: the Peking Duck pizza and the Tandoori Chicken pizza. They were amazing, and I miss them so... This is a great place to take the both the picky eater (unless they think a double-digit pizza is outrageous) and the adventurous. You can be as close to home with a pepperoni pie, or as wacky as the mood strikes you. Their drinks are also fabulous. The kids are in for a treat with Italian sodas and flavored lemonade too - all refillable (and you can change flavors) at no charge! Can't beat that.

Chris B.,"Austin, TX",2,29,5,2.0,4/13/2011,"OK, I have written a few reviews for pizza places I like, but I thought to be fair I would write a review for a pizza place that does not get my approval, CPK. I never go to CPK out of choice. Sadly I have friends who like it, so I find myself there more often than I would like. If given the choice between going to CPK or staying home and picking my nose until it bleeds, I would start digging in my nose. But I love my friends so I will go there just to be with them.  So why all the hate for CPK? Well, I am a New Yorker and sorry, the following pizzas are Biblical abominations in my mind: -Buffalo Chicken (Come on, I am a NYer, there is no such thing as a Buffalo Chicken Pizza) -Thai Chicken (Pizza crust and Asian flavors don't mix.) -California Club (Lettuce on  Pizza? Ugh.) -Pear & Gorgonzola (OH COME ON! PEARS ON PIZZA. FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!) If for some reason you have to go to this place, get the fish tacos. The fish tacos are passable.

Because my new obsession is the pear gorgonzola pizza.  On a recent visit I was debating between two or three choices and asked the waitress her opinion. She said the pear gorgonzola was their most unusual offering, so I decided to go for it in a ""people love it or hate it"" kind of experiment. I've been back twice since and don't even bother with the menu. I'd like to say that I take half home for lunch the next day, but alas, I usually manage to devour every sweet-and-tangy crumb right then and there.

Phillip Y.,"Chicago, IL",27,67,1,4.0,4/16/2013,"Grabbed dinner here after a shopping trip at the Domain on a Tuesday night. Atmosphere: Very nice, classy, trendy restaurant with a large bar. It was pretty chilly inside, but there was also outside seating. Service: Our server made being a waiter seem like the easiest job in the world. It was actually really nice and simple. Came over, took our orders, asked about desert, and gave us our checks.  Food: The friend I went with can down a large dominos pizza no problem, and I can finish a medium pizza. With that said, for $14 a pizza, it would take 3 pizzas to fill me up. We ordered the sicilian and the pepperoni mushroom and shared them. They were absolutely delicious. Granted, I haven't been to many nicer pizza places. The ingredients were fresh and cooked perfectly. The cheese melted in your mouth and had the movie-like gooeyness. They had a large, delicious looking, variety of deserts. Unfortunately we were on a time crunch and did not order any. I will definitely be trying some the next time I come.  As a summary, the pizzas are delicious but a bit pricey and rather small. Will be coming back to try their deserts!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2?start=100
Darla A.,"Austin, TX",682,368,2000,3.0,9/5/2010,"It seems the more of these places they open, the more the quality is compromised.  Stopped here for lunch a few Saturday's ago. The wait was not bad, 10 minutes or so. The service was just downright missing. No seriously, we were seated (well 2 of them were) until they brought me a chair. Then we sat... (think Jeopardy music for a long time) waiting for someone, anyone to come by and take a drink order. We were there so long, I changed my mind nearly 20 times.... not a good thing.  Finally, we get a waiter. Waters around and I ordered Prosecco. They have the Zonin Prosecco splits on the menu... that was a plus.  I ordered off the small cravings menu - a Tuscan Panzanella Salad which had cannellini beans, little red and yellow tomatoes, croutons, red onion, cucumber, beets, avocado and basil all tossed in a vinagrette. It was ok, but a little too soggy.  I also tried the Korean BBQ Steak Tacos (which in my head seemed like an oxymoron - tacos and Korea, ok). These while small (small cravings = itty bitty corn tortillas) were actually pretty tasty. They had some sort of Korean marinated grilled steak, with a small amount of greens (shredded cabbage, Romaine, sweet onions, scallions and cilantro) and a spicy chili sauce. Perfect size for a snack, but if you are hungry - I suggest you get a second item off the same menu as I did.  While they get extra points for a creative taco and Prosecco, they loose major points for AWOL service. We had to trip anyone going by to get our waiter, and one of my friends actually got up to go pour her own water. When it was time to pay, same problem. I know it is CPK and I know it is the Domain... but that should not be an excuse for poor service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2?start=100

I like the pizza here.  The rest of the place could fall off into the ocean for all I care.  I mean,  if this is what California is bringing to the Austin culinary scene, we need to erect yet another border wall.   Three of us wandered in, parched and hot from watching zombies getting killed by a cupcake cannon (seriously, how often do you get to say THAT??  I love Austin!).  This place was overpopulated.  After a brief 10 minute wait, tho, we were seated... or 2 out of 3 were seated.  They had to run and get a third chair after bringing us to the table.  Awwwkwward.....do the other two of us sit?? who gets seating seniority?  who decides?  Well, I did.  I told Darla she had to eat on the floor.  Done :)   Without going into a lot of whiney detail, our waiter was virtually absent the whole meal.  He buzzed around us busily, without making eye contact or checking in or refilling waters.  Did I mention how thirsty we were???  He only noticed when I went up to the serving station myself to get my own.  And the manager, who stopped by before this, also ignored my water request.  Water.  It's a basic need.  It's relatively cheap.  Look into it California.  It's that blue stuff extending down half your border. If I can't get it at your place, I won't be back.   I really did like the pizza tho and after reading some reviews here, I've discovered you can buy them frozen at the store??  And then I can supply my own water and not deal with the frustration of the restaurant???  Done and done. ***jk, I actually love alot of California and would be put out if San Fran or Napa fell into the ocean.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2?start=100

Although I don't recommend sitting at the bar, maybe we went on an off day. The bartender we got was extremely rude, didn't smile not once. Even when a girl next to us exclaimed, it was her birthday! My order was messed up, and the bartender offered no apology, and just walked off, leaving me in limbo, whether the mistake was being fixed or not, another server I flagged down had to tell me it was being fixed! She refused to split our checks(it was only two of us).   Do Not mention the fact that it took a good 15 minutes to get the check.  The only time she smiled was when she handed us the check. I'm usually not the one to the complain  to managers, I have worked in the service industry, and I get it, sometimes waiting on people can be exhausting. But the Manager was super sweet and helpful.

Garlic Cream Fettuccine- (this is what I ordered)  the flavor was pretty darn good!  I asked for extra sauce because I like my pastas saucy.  I also added chicken for $3 and sauteed mushrooms for $1.  Unlike my gf, I had a whole heap of chicken in mine.  :)  Everyone else at the table enjoyed it as well Sicilian Thin Crust pizza-  this was quite flavorful- I was quite surprised how flavorful it was actually.  Only complaint on this was the pizza was more chewy than it was crispy for a thin crust. The Works Original crust pizza- eh, it's basically a surpreme pizza.  Nothing too exciting.   Classic Caesar-  Talk about a big salad!   We also add chicken to this.  It was enough to share with 6 people.

I'm somewhat of a pizza snob - I bake my own from scratch at home.  One thing I've noticed is that their pizza ovens actually aren't that hot, so they need to use chemicals in the crust to allow it to brown.  Both the crust and sauce have a lot of sugar.  It takes at least 20 minutes to get your pizza, so if you're in any sort of hurry, forget it.  Don't get me wrong, they have some tasty pizzas, but is that taste just a trick?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2?start=140

Megan W.,"Austin, TX",8,15,6,2.0,12/11/2008,"To clarify, this is the location in The Domain, not Barton Creek Mall. I so badly want to like CPK here in Austin, but they make it very hard.  The food is good as far as taste and appearance goes.  I usually start out with the spinach artichoke dip and then either order the half chicken caesar salad or the hawaiian pizza with honey wheat dough.  The portions are adequate, but the price is outrageous.  To order a half salad, spinach dip, and an iced tea, the total comes to nearly 27 dollars!! (also, they do not have a lunch menu with reduced portions and prices)  I dine in every so often and each time I was diappointed by the waitstaff.  Everything is pretty open....so you can see them chatting with each other instead of refilling your drinks and bringing out your food that's been sitting there for 10 minutes.   After such a bad dining experience, I still found myself wanting the food.  So I decided to order take-out.  WAY WORSE than going inside.  I would NEVER recommend take-out CPK to anyone.  I have done it several times and every single time they either don't have my order, completely screwed it up, or I get all the way home with a caesar salad with no dressing.  They don't own up to their mistakes and give you even worse service when you bring it to their attention. I will say that there is ONE server in the entire place that makes it worth going, and that's Jokabeth.  If you ever find yourself dining there, request him.  He is perfection.  He runs to and from the kitchen and always pays attention to the details, remembering you and your order when you return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin-2?start=140

The food was good, if expensive for what it was. To start, we had the lettuce wrap with chicken and shrimp. The chicken and shrimp were hot and tasty, the lettuce was cold, they went together like lettuce and meat. For our main course we had the pear&gorgonzola pizza and the carne asada pizza. Both were tasty and filling. I don't know that I'd really call what we had pizzas though... besides the lack of tomato sauce, which was fine, the pizza crust was more thin and crunchy than chewy and soft like NY style pizza. The prices were kind of expensive for the food, but on the other hand it seemed pretty cheap for the Domain.

Christy G.,"Austin, TX",2,26,,1.0,10/13/2007,"I agree with Andrew C.'s observation.  This CPK location sucks.  The one at Barton Creek Mall is much better - food-wise and service-wise.  I have been to many CPKs in the past and the food is always of the highest quality and even though the price is moderate, you feel like you're getting your money's worth because the service is excellent and the food is delicious.  Not so at this Domain location. In fact, the food and service have been consistently so bad (I have eaten at this location about five or six times) that I've been compelled to write a letter to the manager detailing my experiences.  Why eat there so many times if it's so bad, you ask?  My experiences at other CPKs had been so good that I hoped that the bad food/service was just a fluke, plus it's a convenient 2 minute drive from my work.   Here is an outline of some of my experiences: -First time I ate there it was pretty late at night (around 9-ish) and there were maybe only four other tables occupied.  Our waiter looked so bored and lacked any kind of enthusiasm  when he asked us what we wanted to order.  He didn't come around to refill our drinks the whole time we were there and we had to ask him where our food was a couple of times.  It wasn't busy at all and for some reason it took 25-30 minutes for our food to arrive, if not longer.    -I went to dinner another time - again, fairly late.  We had a waitress who was explaining to my husband which soups were vegetarian when another server walked by and said, ""that's not vegetarian, it has chicken broth in it.""  She then proceeded to yell at her co-worker as he walked off: ""NO IT DOESN'T!  I CHECKED!  IT'S VEGETARIAN!""  At that point things were just awkward.  She then started to lightly bad-mouth the other server to us.  The food arrived in acceptable time but it took us forever to receive our bill and it took a long time for her to process our payment.   -Another time I went with a co-worker and we called in our food order - we both ordered completely different salads.  Somehow they managed to screw that up so when we got there we had to wait another 20 minutes for our food to be fixed.  I ordered a salad with shrimp and it took 20 minutes to cook the shrimp?  Granted it was during the lunch rush but you would have thought that it would have been rushed through as a priority order.  When we brought our food back to work, my co-worker realized that her salad was chock-full of chickpeas.  That wouldn't have been horrible if she didn't HATE chickpeas and didn't ask them for NO chickpeas in her salad.  She spent 15 minutes picking out all of the chickpeas and chickpea parts.  Additionally, the lettuce in her salad was wilted and most of the lettuce leaves were red around the edges; it did not look fresh.     -The last time we went (and after this I SWORE to never eat there again), I ordered a field greens salad with pear, shrimp and gorgonzola cheese for take-out.  This is my favorite salad at CPK, so when I got it home I was horribly disappointed to see that much of the salad was tainted with wilted and mushy leaves.  I spent 15 minutes picking out the inedible soggy parts and wiping off leaves with mushy parts on it.  I ordered the full order of the salad and by the time I got all of the gross parts out of it I had little more than half a salad.   If you decide to ever eat there, I suggest sticking to pizza - don't even bother with the salads.  And don't expect the service to be anything more than horrible.  If you are still craving some CPK, eat at the Barton Creek Mall location.  Don't waste your money at the Domain.

Sarah P.,"Austin, TX",6,19,,5.0,10/14/2007,"I'm really surprised at the other reviews.  I have been there several times since it opened, and have had good experiences each time.   My only complaint was one time I went with my boyfriend and his dad, and our server was so over-eager and friendly it was awkward and annoying.  However, I would rather have that any day of the week than someone who is angry or absent. I was super excited when it opened, as it's much closer than Barton Creek for me, and it's one of my favorite restaurants, even though it's a chain.

Quani C.,"Austin, TX",588,476,64,3.0,10/8/2008,"CPK didn't, by any  means, knock my socks off.  To be quite honest it was a pretty forgettable experience, as in, I'm trying to forget about it as I sit here typing. After our standard lunchtime decision making spat, partner and I decided to head to CPK... I, never having been before, and he not having been in a long time.  We should've gone for one of our backups.  Most of the wait staff looked burdened to be there, as if they couldn't find jobs at any other restaurant in town.  Regular ol' beverages (not of the adult variety) STARTED at $2.39... my partner drew the line and ordered water in lieu of his usual iced tea.  Everything else was kind of pricey as well, especially for lunch.  We had to inquire about the size of the pizzas and if we'd need an additional food item to tide both of us over until dinner, the waitron's answer was yes, but she was unable to tell us the inches of the pizza (you know how us girls are about the inches).  We ordered the Thai Chicken Pizza and chicken lettuce wraps, which came out at the same time.  As I said before, my socks remained on the entire time.  Pizza was tasty, however.  I'd rather have lettuce wraps from the likes of PF Chang's or PeiWei.  Service, overall, was acceptable, I suppose. The place itself is kinda fancy, which I guess is to be expected from a restaurant in The Domain, but it also seemed like it perhaps was ""trying too hard to fit in.""  I like my divey pizza joints.  They have a full bar and a few beers on tap, I noticed Live Oak taps.  Seems, however, that the clientele that they get there wouldn't take full advantage of the full bar.  Really... three types of Grey Goose, five types of Absolut?  And the list goes on as such.  We also noticed a slight abundance of families, although the place was relatively dead.  At least the little kids were well behaved.

Rose K.,"Austin, TX",2,14,,1.0,4/9/2012,"Sometimes I'm at The Domain and I want to grab something to eat that isn't too fancy, too expensive, or too uppity.  Despite it's casual air, it's a bit pricey and the service is consistently downright terrible. We've eaten there about 24 times over the years and we've yet to have a single instance of consistently decent service.  The waitstaff are not even remotely prompt in checking in with you when you first arrive and once you place your order, good luck on it arriving quickly or having your waitperson check on you for any reason. The food ranges from tasty to nasty. We've found that if we stick to certain items, we get what we're expecting (i.e., their sandwiches tend to be good along with their side salads, but beware the croutons...stale yuckiness!). The final straw for us came when I was having a bad week and decided to splurge on getting a pecan praline cheesecake that was on special.  I couldn't stuff it down while at the restaurant, so I got it to go.  Later that day, I busted that baby out and with great anticipation dug into it for my first bite. Oh dear God, was that ever horrible. It had a salty, vinegary taste that overrode the sweetness of the cheesecake.  Because I was in denial, I actually ate three bites before I took a deep whiff of it's aroma and recognized the odor.  It wasn't a lovely praline sauce on top of the cheesecake, but instead, was the asian potsticker dipping sauce.  You may have a hard time imagining the sheer nastiness of the co-mingling of flavors, but please believe me, it is one of the most horrible things I've ever eaten in my life.
