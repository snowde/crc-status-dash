Ron C.,"Garden Grove, CA",91,11,,5.0,8/4/2017,"Ariyah provided the most extraordinary service.  She was extremely conscientious and friendly:  a delight in conversation.   Ariyah went beyond normal service in helping us perfect our pizza choice - Vegetarian with white sauce, wheat crust, goat cheese and added light garlic beneath the cheese (she explained previous customer experiences of raw garlic under cheese being overpowering, while another had garlic on top where the garlic had burned).   Unsure of a soup choice, she brought samples of two of the soups we were considering.  She did the same with a drink I considered.  My best friend loved the Strawberry smoothie, and when we described what we liked and didn't, she came up with the idea of mixing Fresca and Ginger Ale, which was awesome!  Highly creative. Ariyah was able to enhance our experience by relating her own as well as previous customer preferences.  Together, we came up with dining choices we would never have thought up on our own.   Ariyah helped turn what could have been a typical dinner out into a truly delightful and fun evening!  Thanks, Ariyah!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bakersfield

The BBQ, the Sicilian and the Mushroom. In addition we ordered the Kung Pao spaghetti with shrimp. Everything was delicious. I ordered a Beefeater on the rocks as I usually do at a dinner house and was surprised at the generous pour.

This is what the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine did to me from CPK.  I think I'm in love. It is spinach fettuccine with red onions, bell peppers and fresh cilantro all being caressed with this amazing creamy jalapeño lime sauce. Oh my gosh!  The BBQ chicken pizza is one of our faves. The kid's pasta was also tasty, although I wish they would include some kind of veggie with it. The service was amazing, the manager even checked in with us.

They actually have pretty good tasting salads. One of my favorite salads from CPK has to probably be the Thai chicken salad. The mixture of greens and goods go well together and surprisingly very filling. The BBQ chicken salad is also a good choice. I'm not a huge fan of the unique types of pizzas that they make, but if I had to choose a favorite then I would definitely have to choose the spinach artichoke pizza. The artichoke and spinach seem to team up great together and even better when you add chicken. One of the things that stand out for me has to be the cookies.. Haha.. I know I know.. It's a pizza place and I'm choosing cookies.

But this place....I mean they are charging at the lowest cost $13 for a pizza, and the dough isnt even fresh, its frozen packaged. They are stingy with the toppings and sauce as well. We also got an appetizer, another 9 bucks down the drain for processed and frozen meat filling. There thin crust pizzas should be sold as ""crackers with toppings"".

Tim P.,"South Kensington, London, United Kingdom",173,176,30,4.0,3/11/2011,"Sure, it is a chain, but they are very reliable and provide a lot of unique and innovative flavors for their pizzas. I always enjoy a great greek salad, so I decided to try the greek pizza and I was not disappointed. They also make a fabulous spinach and artichoke pizza. It are these unique blends of flavors that always brings me back to this chain.  If you are not a pizza fan, no worries, the salads will not disappoint. Personally, I am a fan of the waldorf chicken salad. And if you are an individual who eats gluten free foods, CPK has a variety of gluten free options (always a relief to those trying to find gluten free alternatives at restaurants). I am a big connoisseur of spinach artichoke dip and I believe they serve the best dip in town. BJ's is good as well, but I think CPK edge's them out. Lastly, they always serve up a warm basket of bread with butter with every order. Seriously, who doesn't love a basket of bread?!?! Also, if you are looking to save a few books, you can buy $100 worth of CPK gift cards for $80 from Costco.

Joe W.,"Bakersfield, CA",7,18,,1.0,1/20/2015,"Seriously, if your seeking something that resembles actual pizza keep moving. I imagine that there are some people who prefer a razor thin crust cooked to cracker consistency. I think there might be people who like a 2-3 inch space between the edge of the crust and the start of the tomato sauce. I might even entertain the idea that a tasteless and thin tomato sauce is really desired by some people. I however cannot believe that anyone wants to find a stick on their pizza. I found a piece of wood, the size and thickness of a tooth pick on my pepperoni and mushroom pizza. Perhaps a piece of sage brush, maybe the trunk of a bay leaf bush, never the less stabbing yourself in the gum with foliage is NOT my idea of a great pizza experience. Expensive, badly made, and simply not worth the money. Oh, by the way, pepperoni is not being rationed by the government just yet, but at this place they act as if It is.Each slice is worth its weight in shaved gold by their standards and they ration it out accordingly.

Kyle B.,"Bakersfield, CA",275,41,79,5.0,6/26/2015,"So last Tuesday My daughter, her boyfriend and myself decided to check out this new Next Chapter menu at California Pizza Kitchen.  We hadn't been to California Pizza Kitchen in over 7 or 8 years.  We arrive around 7pm and the place was not to busy for a Tuesday evening so the hostess seated us right away.  Within less than a minute our server Blake came over and greets us.  My daughter asks about the Strawberry Mango Cooler and decided it sounds refreshing so Blake fills our drink order and proceeds to tell us about the new menu, we ask a few questions and we make our choices. The first thing we order is our Appetizers.  I get the Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings and she gets the Chicken Lettuce Wrap with Shiitake Mushrooms. First the Dumplings were wonderful!  light with just a hint of ginger, not over powering at all. It came with 6 or 7 on the plate I think and that was enough for all three of us.  I would defiantly order them again. The Lettuce wraps.  I enjoyed the lettuce wrap. But not as much as Taylor,  She had two.  I Liked the the fact that they didn't skimp on the Shiitake Mushrooms. The Main meal.   Here is where I was really impressed with their whole new menu.  They may be called California Pizza Kitchen but they have so much more now. I ordered the Ribeye.  Yep, you read that right!  A Ribeye at a pizza place.  Who knew?   This was a 12oz ribeye cooked perfect (the way I ordered it).  I'm already a blue cheese fan, so when I saw it came with a creamy blue cheese butter I was hooked.   I like the fact that when it was delivered it was still piping hot, not like it had been sitting around waiting on the rest of the food.  I tried the other entrees and will give you their review in a moment but this was by far my favorite and I will return for this steak again. My Daughter ordered the Halibut, now she lived in Alaska and worked at a fishing lodge last summer so she is a bit spoiled when it comes to salmon, halibut & crab.  In her opinion this halibut reminders of being back in Ketchikan, AK.  Not quite as good as catching it, filleting it and eating it all in the same 12 hours but about as close as you can get.  I was lucky enough to get a small sample of the halibut and I have to agree.  The halibut was tender but not to flaky and well it had really good flavor it certainly was not fishy. The boyfriend.  Being young and a boy played it safe and ordered a pizza.  Half pepperoni and half pineapple.  California Pizza Kitchen Bakersfield peperoni and half pineapple Pizza Jeremy, not one to give a lot of accolades did say he liked the pizza and after the last pizza place we went to (no names) he was happy they actually put enough topping on the pizza that you could taste the flavor.  This individual pizza was so big he had to take some home.  This is about as good as it gets coming from this kid. All in all it was a wonderful meal.  The service was top notch.  We really enjoyed the fact that not only did our server Blake make sure our drinks were never empty but, that the chef him self delivered some of the food and cared enough to check on us.  Now before you go thinking it was special treatment, sadly we're not that special, I noticed Chef Esteban, Ast Manager Zack and even the GM Frank seem to be taking a real interest in the customers. checking in on them, asking if there is anything they can get you, etc.  It was nice to see the attention they payed to all their customers.   They offered us a tour of the restaurant. How could we say no.  From the prep station to the back area and even the brick oven. We saw it all.  during the tour Chef Esteban told us how on days and evenings when they have time they love to take young kids back their and show them how to toss a pizza. As you can see I'm a pretty big kid. They showed us how to toss the pizza dough.  Must say this was a really fun night with my daughter and her boyfriend. One of the things that stood out to me is over the entrance to the kitchen was the American Flag.  I asked the GM Frank, who's idea was it to fly the flag.  He said it was his flag and he was proud of it.  I was very happy to hear someone proud to display the flag in a public business.  This alone goes a long way in my book.  Not to mention the fact that they also displayed images of  Bakersfield including The Fox Theater, The Clock Tower & The old Chamber Building at the Kern County Museum among other local images.  I have not seen many restaurants show as much pride in Bakersfield as I did on Tuesday night from the staff at California Pizza Kitchen. So in the opinion of just another Bakersfield local I would have to say that California Pizza Kitchen gets 5 out of 5 Stars from all three of us.California Pizza Kitchen Bakersfield Ohh, I almost forgot.  The best part was desert! I'll leave you with this.  A picture is worth a thousand. . . Enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bakersfield?start=40

OMG!  The bomb. I've got just one thing that bugs me. They have two waiters in there that have beards. Just so you don't send me a bunch of pissed off responses, I don't have anything against beards. But the one guy pulls his hair back in a knotted mess and he looks like he just crawled out from under a bridge. The other guy wears his neat. If the other guy ever gets assigned to me as a waiter I will request someone new. Most people won't do that---they just won't come back. I think this is negligent on the managements part. The thing is, I feel there is just too big a chance that some of his gross beard hairs could end up in my families food on the way from the kitchen. I'm sure if management reads this they will just scoff at it. That's fine. Free world. Just so you know, I would be equally upset if a girl waitress had a gross head of hair!!  Gotta dock the whole review 1 point for the gross beard.

My fiance and I usually look at a restaurant's menu prior to coming in. We usually know what we want. When the waitress (believe her name was Bree? Brea?) asked if we had questions about the menu, I said no not really, we are ready to order, she seemed rather annoyed and responded with ""Hmm, oh ok"" Sorry we made your job easier? After ordering she also asked ""So um did you want some bread?"" Do you have to ask? Of course! When another waitress brought our meals out, we had to ask for refills. We sat and finished our drinks, not once did our waitress check on us. Another waiter brought us drinks. It wasn't until the end when she was ready to hand us our bill that Bree/Brea, came and checked on us.  My pizza was cold and the dough was not fully cooked.

Ariana B.,"Bakersfield, CA",88,83,121,4.0,12/6/2015,"I usually try not to frequent chain restaurants. Especially here in Bakersfield where we have so many incredible local food options. However, there are a few exceptions, including CPK. Their food is pretty consistently good, the service is very friendly every time I come here from the hosts to the wait staff, and it seems that the company makes an effort to be creative and inventive with their menu choices. I remember being in like 7th grade (over a decade ago) when this place opened up. Through the years, I've noticed staff members that have been around since the early days. I think it means something to see that the employees generally enjoy their time here and have stayed put for so long.  My son, my mom, and I had a good lunch experience here this week. Our waitress - Jules - was very sweet and attentive. It was a little hectic from me changing my mind mid-order, my son being hungry and grouchy, and my mom wanting a slew of things for her coffee. Jules didn't bat an eye and gave us friendly service that I generally expect from CPK.  The food was pretty great, as usual. I ordered a lunch combo of half soup/half sandwich. It was tasty & a good amount of food for about 8-9$. I usually order a pasta dish or an appetizer (especially those avocado rolls...omg yum) and I'm never disappointed. Plus they have flavored lemonades...I know that sounds so menial but seriously they're so good. It's hard to come here and not get a raspberry lemonade. It comes looking like two solid stripes (lemonade + raspberry) and just trust me, mix it up and you'll taste heaven. I know there are other flavors but I'm hooked on the raspberry. May need intervention.  We tried their seasonal pumpkin + gingerbread cheesecake and I decided pretty quickly that I would do my best to emulate what I tasted that day into an equally delicious dessert for my post-Christmas meal. So scrumptious.  CPK is not always my first choice because I try to frequent local joints over chains. However, it's a great lunch spot and they've earned a spot in my general monocle of food choices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bakersfield?start=20
Jennifer W.,"Bakersfield, CA",237,312,702,3.0,11/23/2015,"This is the third time I've ever been to CPK. I've been to one in three different cities: Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, and now here. I really haven't been impressed with any of the 3 restaurants we have been to. I don't know why. We had a gift card for here, so we tried it. I must say, I probably won't be spending my own money coming here, I'd rather go somewhere else.  As we walked up, my husband and boys took the rotating door and the hostess opened the door for me and cheerfully greeted us. We were seated right away as it wasn't crowded at all. I also liked the fact that the hostess asked if we wanted a booth. I like having that option  because I absolutely dislike sitting at a table. They are so uncomfortable to me.  We were greeted right away by our server. She took our drink order and brought us freshly baked bread. Unfortunately, she spilled my son's whole drink all over. We were not upset at all because we're all human and she apologized profusely. But, boy was it a mess!  My husband and I shared a Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza. My youngest ordered Cheese Pizza and my oldest ordered Curly Mac & Cheese. The boys both like their food. Although I tried a bite of the Curly Mac & Cheese and didn't care for it. There was no flavor at all. Honestly, a box of Kraft Mac & Cheese is better. Now for our pizza...I was not impressed at all. There was something missing, I can't say what.

So bizarre, but he loved it! haha (2) Crispy Mac n cheese - it's basically mac n' cheese balls, breaded all around. 3.5 stars (3) Pepperoni sausage mushroom pizza - yes, this tastes like any typical pepperoni pizza, kinda reminds me of the costco kind (4) Habanero carnitas pizza - this pizza was interesting, the husband picked it and thought it was decent. I don't remember what it tastes like to be honest. (5) Spicy chicken tinga quesadilla - this was an appetizer item and i thought it was tasty, but the portion size is so small!

Vishal N.,"Miami, FL",126,4,5,1.0,8/16/2015,"I fell in love with CPK when I used to live in Fresno. And as a pizza lover one would think you can't go wrong. Well here in Bakersfield we teach you how to do everything wrong. Whether you have take out or dine in service, you're always left unattended and leave this place annoyed.  Unless you're lucky and get one of the older and sweeter waitresses, don't expect a good time there. Oh yeah, did I mention that their dough for pizza is frozen?! No wonder it always feels so soggy.  Avoid this place and find better quality of pizza elsewhere.  If you are seated at a table, as per my experience, you will get your food before you get your water, napkins, plates, and silverware. Am I supposed to eat like a slob when I'm out?

Jen H.,"Bakersfield, CA",52,169,988,3.0,7/11/2015,"CPK is located on the corner of Stockdale Hwy and Old River Rd/Calloway by the Elephant Bar. Adjacent parking lot is fairly large but is also utilized by people going to the Riverwalk nearby. Inside the decor is clean and modern. We recently tried some of the new dishes and were pleasantly surprised. The Maine lobster flatbread from the new summer menu actually had decent amount of lobster meat! The addition of dill gave it a nice cooling flavor. For dessert, the S'mores dish was delicious though I thought the graham cracker bottom was a bit dense. The toasted marshmallow was yummy-thick and gooey. My favorite pizzas are the mushroom pizza (with over 3 different types of mushroom including portabello and shiitake), the Californa veggie (inc red onion, mushroom, tomatoes, corn, eggplant) and the mushroom sausage pepperoni pizza. Spinach artichoke dip is consistently good. The white corn guacamole app is a bit in the small side. They have a good range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. The strawberry cooler is a bit saccharine tasting to me. There are also no refills on that drink. A better deal are the lemonades (peach, strawberry, etc) which have unlimited refill for less than $3.  Our server for dinner recently was friendly and checked in on us constantly. However, she was vastly different from ones we have had at lunch. I'm docking one star due to the erratic lunch service we've had in the past which often required asking for water/bread and reminding the server about our order. Btw, the Rewards program is worth joining. Each time you go, after registering, you give the server your phone # which is associated with the account. This ensures you receive points for each meal that you have. After two meals, I recently received a coupon for $10 off a $40 meal which was instantly applied to our last meal.

Host was there at his station, very friendly and so were our servers. Our main waiter was very attentive without being overbearing and did not hesitate to make menu suggestions. Ordered was a margarita pizza and a quinoa/arugula salad. Both arrived promptly and were great dishes! The pizza for $13 is huge and I took half home with me and that was after sharing. The restaurant IMO is beautiful but we learned today this location is about to undergo a 1.3 million dollar facelift to make it more modern and sleek (with more TVs at the bar). It will not close at this upcoming time but will shut down sections at a time until completion! I cannot wait to see what it will look like! There is a take out door as well. I love this style of pizza. Cooked very quickly in a hot oven with a chewy crust and quality ingredients. And NOT cooked until it is burned! The menu is vast and has something for everyone!

Jimsy V.,"Bakersfield, CA",5,150,124,5.0,7/3/2016,"First time ever to visit this place.   Awesomeness all the way around.   I actually had to meet a client tonight and he happened to be a regular.   The staff knew him, what he typically orders, and his beverage.   That was cool.  He recommended for me the garlic creme fetucini with chicken...It was excellent.  One of the waitresses happened to be a former student.  Friendly staff, great food, and wonderful decor.  Can't wait to go back next week.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bakersfield?start=20

Eileen K.,"Pasadena, CA",532,475,1123,4.0,8/26/2011,"Nicer part of town, clean, spacious, open, fountain outside, friendly service (our server was soo nice!!) and comforting food. (who didn't grow up on CPK food?!)  I havent been to CPK in awhile, and was sad to see that they no longer have the Garlic Shrimp pizza. Am i the only one who remembers this?! Anyone!?  Also, didn't they used to have chunks of strawberries in their strawberry lemonade?? Anyway, I digress.  BIG plus: I asked for tobasco (my default hot sauce when I eat out..since no one has sriracha..) and the server looked apologetic and said they don't have tobasco...(Imagine my horror here!!)...BUT...they do have sriracha. YAY! Brought out in a cute little bowl on top of a napkin on top of a plate with a small spoon on the side (see picture) Definitely made my day :)   I enjoyed my food, clean, open, relaxing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bakersfield?start=60

Jesus B.,"Bakersfield, CA",32,26,21,3.0,4/20/2014,"Finally had an opportunity to eat here after having a gift card for a few months sitting in the back of my wallet.  we were going to sit on the patio since it was such a nice day, but the hostess said it might be a little bit of a wait outside since there was only 1 server, since my wife and I were hungry we opted for a booth inside,  no biggie.  Now the food. I picked the avocado, chicken, bacon (eggrolls? ) as an appettizer. They were amazing, nice and crispy with big chunks of chicken and bacon.  For the pizza my wife got the chicken club,  and I asked our server which she recommended between the spicy chipotle or the habanero carnitas, and she suggested the latter.  The chicken club was hard to eat, all of the toppings kept falling off . It looked like a salad in a bread bowl. The spicy habanero was pretty good and I was surprised the dipping sauce actually had a little heat to It.  I was a little dissapointed in the sense that it wasn't really what I would consider pizza. I love cheese, toppings, and my marinera.  I ended up paying 50$, (2 pizzas, 1 appettizer, 1 lemonade, 1 water) which is a little steep especially for the pizzas being so small. Taking that into account with the fact that it's a 25 minute drive, I don't think we will be back anytime soon. If we do decide to give it another chance, it won't be for the pizza. Maybe one of their sandwiches or salads, those looked pretty good.  Oh before I forget to mention it, the service was great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bakersfield?start=60

Carrie N.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,2,,5.0,5/20/2015,"Best experience I have had at a restaurant in a long time. I was there with a group of 10, which we were quickly accommodated. Frank set up a table for us on the patio with a beautiful view of the fountain. He graciously went over the new menu with us which had the most delicious handcrafted drinks. My favorite was the ""Executive Decision""!  It was a refreshing martini with a hint of mint.  Our server James was efficient, friendly and very professional. He gave us excellent recommendations from the salads to desserts. The butter cake is a must have when coming here. We will definitely be coming back to try the rest of new menu items as the service and food was above excellence.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bakersfield?start=60

Teresa E.,"Bakersfield, CA",2,1,,5.0,6/17/2015,Unbelievable. We walked through the door and the hostess asked us if we had been in before.  We told her it was our first time. She immediately recommended the butter cake. (Amazing! ) She had to tell the waiter because he went through the whole menu for us. He recommended the avocado chicken eggrolls. (Deeelicious!)the manager came over and introduced himself asked how things were and then brought the chefs! Wow. I gave never been so impressed.  Uou Could Tell That This Restaurant Was Top Notch Customer Service Oriented!  I would definitely come back.

Kim R.,"Bakersfield, CA",35,40,15,2.0,11/22/2015,"Where do I begin--don't you love when sentences start with that?!  I have been disappointed with CPK in one way or another with every single order. Unfortunately my main squeeze has CPK cravings from time to time and he won't stop begging for it until I make the trek all the way to the other side of town to appease his CPK appetite.  We used to love the ""BLT"" pizza then it changed to the ""California club"" which is not a step up at all. It was a simple fresh pizza with cheese, bacon, lettuce with some sort of mayo and tomato.  The pizza now has chicken, avocado (which is actually good) and added arugula to the lettuce mixture. (I'm sorry CPK, arugula needs acidity and saying you add lemon to the mixture, which I didn't taste, is not enough. So now I'm forced to specialize the order which the gladly do.  I have to order  it with no chicken and no arugula, I know it sounds like I'm whining...I am.  This last time I ordered spinach artichoke dip....it's usually always good and it was good this time too, but they didn't put the lid on correctly and it spilled all over so I ate it out of the bag grrrrr..I also ordered a petite wedge salad that was just ok. They put egg in the salad that I thought was weird and even weirder when I started chewing an egg shell...CPK is getting 2 stars because I always order take out and the customer service has always been on point but I can tell you than when I hear the words ""I want CPK"" I'm secretly annoyed....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bakersfield?start=60
Sarah D.,"Bakersfield, CA",4,30,6,2.0,1/28/2015,"Not impressed. This is the 2nd CPK I have visited. The 1st was in Omaha, NE and I was not impressed then. My 6 year old had been really wanting to try CPK so we decided to give it another go here in Bakersfield. No surprise, it wasn't very good. It wasn't terrible but nothing makes me want to come back again. I think the food was over priced for the quality. Oh, and the entire meal, we heard various wait staff and managerial staff fighting. Threatening to just quit and making snarky comments like ""I don't need your help"".

Julia R.,"Arvin, CA",0,2,1,2.0,11/2/2014,"This was not our first time eating at California Pizza Kitchen and in fact consider it one of our family's favorite restaurants ,but the last couple of times we've visited, the service has been terrible. Yesterday however was the worst. Our waitress, I believe her name was Breanna, seemed to be in a very bad mood and was not friendly. Throughout the visit, my sister accidentally spilled her soda and there was a group of employees watching yet they did nothing. My dad had to get up and take a rag from the bar to clean the mess himself. Not only was the service terrible ,but the food didn't taste as good as it used to. I ordered the kung pao spaghetti, a favorite of mine, and it seemed to have no flavor.

Tangerine S.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,16,1,1.0,8/1/2011,"Every time I go to this place I end up leaving asking myself why I continue to do this to myself. I have never once had a good meal at CPK. I know it is a big chain and a lot of people love it; but the food never tastes fresh to me and the design of the restaurant itself is enough to make someone want to run out yelling and screaming! It is as if they took a time machine back to 1972. It is horrible.  Also, I hate being ""persuaded"" by my waiter/waitress. They always try to get you to order an appetizer, or desert, or try their favorite thing on the menu. I DON'T CARE IF YOU LOVE IT, I DON'T WANT IT! It is like I am shopping for furniture every time I am there; I have to think of an excuse why I don't want dessert this time, or why I don't really care to try their most popular appetizer. If you want a good tip, don't try to upsale the bill. The worst part about it is, they do this knowing exactly what they are doing, but try to do it in a way that makes you think they are just here to help you. Well no one honestly thinks that, we all know what you are trying to do. It makes you and your restaurant look cheap! If I tell you I don't want dessert, DO NOT waste my time getting the check to grab a dessert menu (this process took 10 minutes) ""Just in case I change my mind.""  This last time we went, we weren't even offered bread. At first I noticed just the larger parties were receiving the bread, but after a few tables with 4 people and one with 2 people got bread I was officially upset! So our waitress will do whatever she can for us to spend as much as possible on everything on the damn menu, but not even get us complimentary bread that comes our for everyone! She was very friendly, but man I was ready to get out of there ASAP before my dinner even arrived!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bakersfield?start=60
