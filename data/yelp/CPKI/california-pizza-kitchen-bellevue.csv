T K.,"Bellevue, WA",2,50,21,5.0,1/1/2018,"Bellevue's California Pizza Kitchen always leaves me with a smile on my face. The pizza is top notch -- I'm convinced CPK is the best chain around. You'll get soft, chewy crust and totally fresh-tasting ingredients. Each pizza I've had here tastes, and looks, wonderful. Plus, the service is polite and proactive without being overbearing. Added bonus: (1) Free parking, and (2) warm, crusty bread with olive oil & herbs for dipping.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue
Elbert F.,"Redmond, WA",1,3,,2.0,12/6/2017,"Very underwhelmed by the service. Last night I came in with my family (wife and 3 kids) to dinner for the first time. Being a first time customer I really didn't have any expectations but not in a million years did I think service would be that deficient. For starters they gave the kids those kid's menus that have activities but when we inquired about crayons they said they'd run out since Thanksgiving! Having the activity book with nothing to write with made the kids even more restless than if they had not received anything in the first place. That aside we ordered drinks (including lemonade for the now restless kids) and it took them almost 20 minutes to bring! All this while the restaurant was, at best, half full. After this waitress took our order (pizzas and an appetizer) and the waiting game began once more..after about 20 minutes they brought our pizzas out and when we inquired about the missing ( and quite frankly unwanted by this point) appetizer we were informed that they'd run out!!! How the waitress couldn't come and inform us of this BEFORE bringing our food out is something that escapes me completely. To top it off once we were done with the pizzas and asked for the check we, once more, had to wait more than 10 minutes to be charged. Don't get me wrong; the waitress was very courteous and apologetic and I actually felt bad for her but I fail to understand how a simple pizza and appetizer dinner could've taken so long to complete in a restaurant that was barely half full on a weeknight...That said, I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue
Catherine M.,"Brier, WA",282,146,236,1.0,10/18/2017,"Down with CPK! A few weeks back I used a coupon from a friend (which hilariously and ironically didn't save me money but cost me more - good job marketing team, I see you). We showed up like 20 minutes before closing to place a pretty simple take out order. Attitude across the board between the bartender/takeout guy and the manager. I don't blame them for being tired and cranky, so that didn't really matter. But the food, the food matters. And the food we got sucked.  I will say the Italian chopped salad was and always has been good. The Kung pao chicken and shrimp spaghetti was a let down- small and no doubt overpriced, considering the meats add-on costs I think $7 and the portion size is truly that of a decorative garnish.. The most infuriating part of getting home with our take out was opening the pizza (Cali Cobb pizza)---- this was supposed to be the main event. And, there in the box was this little crusty thing with some cheese on it; the toppings came separate!!! (As if this is an effing toy I'm supposed to build at home) so there I am, after raving to my friend about how good the food is here, and now I'm equal parts embarrassed and disappointed. But I build my pizza (i.e. Lay out the slices of tomato, avocado, and mix the iceberg lettuce with its aoli, then top the pie with all this. With my bare hands. Cuz the chef couldn't do it. Because... the pizzas gonna get soggy...? Sure, whatever) one last thing about that pizza, a few years ago it was to die for and one of the highlights of it was the arugula they topped it with, which like I said is now a cheaper mix of iceberg. In summary, quality and value has all around fallen out the back of the truck.  It was a waste of $45. We sorta picked at it and spent most of the meal talking about how much of a let down it was. Never eating here again.  I feel sad because at one point I loved CPK. I give up with this chain *_____*",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue

Holli M.,"Renton, WA",74,180,439,2.0,7/7/2017,"Haven't been to CPK for about 3-4 years. I'm glad they offer 2 hour free parking because parking would be difficult. The place is clean, staff were friendly and service was pretty good. Our drinks never went empty.  I ordered the barbque chicken salad with avocados. Oh the avocados were an extra $3. My salad arrived  with minimal amounts of dressing. Very bland and the barbque chicken was COLD!!! With barbque sauce on it which was the only thing that gave it flavor. So I paid $19 for a full tasteless salad. Um was this why I haven't been here in years?!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue
Taylor Z.,"Austin, TX",551,272,1165,1.0,6/28/2017,"Wow, just wow. This California was just so bad when I came here. The service was slow, the food was meh, and the price was probably the worst part. First on the service, it took us ages to get seated even though there were 10 tables for 2 (I counted). And they continued to be empty even after we ate and left. The server took forever to take our order, never refilled our water, and then took ages to get our check. Everything that could go wrong, went wrong. The food was way overpriced and was really small in portion. Probably would've went to a grocery store with a pre-made meal with better taste and bigger portions for half the cost. Avoid at all costs. I'm definitely not coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue
Eric E.,"Bellevue, WA",192,76,85,4.0,5/25/2017,"Been to a few CPK across the states, and this is one of the better establishments I've visited. Of course, that is contingent on the staff and if the load is manageable enough for them that day--waits can be extremely long sometimes.  Lunch here most of the time is smooth and parking can be validated to avoid some charges. The pizza is good...not amazing or anything but it hits the spot. I'd suggest The Works or Sicilian as safe picks for pizza. For salads, maybe a Waldorf or Italian Chopped will whet your appetite for the main courses--don't forget sourdough bread.  Personally, I opt for the Ribeye or Halibut/Salmon with some quinoa on the side and the lady usually gets the Shrimp Scampi Zucchini. The kids occasionally enjoy a simple Pepperoni Pizza with some panko crusted Mac n Cheese...then smash a Brownie and Sundae haha.  It's good here. Do ittt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue

Rohit G.,"Maywood, NJ",40,126,229,3.0,10/14/2017,"I went to this place for lunch. Was clean and not crowded at all. I was attended to promptly and seated. Ordered charred Shishito peppers, spicy buffalo cauliflower and Bianco flatbread. The order came quite late considering their were only 5 table worth of guests. Shishito peppers were burnt with a bitter taste. Cauliflower was delicious and bianco flatbread was ordinary.

Mon L.,"Bellevue, WA",162,122,1591,5.0,12/9/2016,"***service can be either great or super slow. There are 2-3 wait staff for the whole restaurant in the weekend. If the place is full, get ready to wait for your food.*** This is my family favorite 's restaurant. I go there a lot. I mean 2-4 times per month for over 5 years. I have tried almost everything they have on the menus. First of all, their salad is the best in town.  I don't order salad anywhere else except at CPK. Super fresh and tasty. I love cooking and I can tell their veggies and meat are fresh. The comp sourdough bread also tastes so good. We love their ice tea (mango, strawberry, peach). My husband go there so often because he loves the ice tea. My favorite dish are Cobb salad, Waldorf salad, The work pizza, and green pasta with chicken(first one on pasta menu) and pasta cream sauce added shrimp. Desert  for kids, 99 cent for ice cream Sunday, 1.29$ for the brownies. The price is much higher now.

Jess R.,"Grand Terrace, CA",1,7,1,2.0,12/21/2017,"I don't usually take the time to write reviews but this was the worst CPK experience ever. We got there at 8pm so it wasn't during the busiest time or anything. But we waited almost 10 minutes just for someone to greet us once we were seated. Waited another 10 minutes to get 4 waters! We didn't even have our appetizer til 30 minutes after we had been seated. The place was freezing cold cuz the front doors don't actually close properly. And to top it all off, by the time the food came out, it was mediocre at best. The poor server was new and had way too many tables so I don't blame him, except he should have asked for help, or at the very least sent a manager over since we had so many problems! Never going back there again. My free breakfast at a Hampton Inn & Suites last week was better than my $60 meal here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue

Sheri C.,"Seattle, WA",210,1826,1634,3.0,1/8/2017,"CPK is average and giving a review on a national chain is more about what the specific location's service is and how they prepare the dishes.   I don't like the crust on the pizza here so I ordered the BBQ chicken chopped salad.  It's good and filling.  Comes with tortilla strips, beans, jicama, tomatoes, corn, onions, and herb ranch.  I paid extra for the avocado.

When we first arrived, there were at least 5-6 free tables, but were still told there would be a 20-25 minute wait? Finally got seated and our server's name was Raudel, who was probably the worst server we have ever encountered. We had to request for more water, whereas we saw him refill the tables around us multiple times. We asked for a box for our leftovers and he helped us put it into the box, but he made a mess of the box, and there was still food left on the plate.

One thing to note is that they DO validate parking for the lot next to them. We didn't know that initially, and ended up parking somewhere else and walking. We decided to only order three small plates from experience. Usually these plates were a great value, and we didn't feel like stuffing ourselves for lunch. We got the Crispy Mac 'N' Cheese, Spicy Chicken Tinga Quesadilla, and White Corn Guacamole and Chips. The Crispy Mac 'N' Cheese is under $5 and is always delicious. The quesadillas were also fantastic. I didn't find them to be that spicy, but that how I like them. They were probably my favorite item. The guac and chips were also great.

The waiter was very nice and did comp our bill for the drinks and kid pizza.  But the 45 minute wait wasn't worth it for the food.  Food was fine but nothing special enough to make me want to come back.  With their prime location, you'd think they'd step it up a notch with the quality and flavor of food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=80

Well usually they don't hold back on giving you plenty of shrimp for the amount of greens. Not anymore the manager told me that you get the same amount of shrimp added and that it doesn't matter if it's a full salad or half you will get the same amount of shrimp now. Which they use to give more for the bigger order. Not the case anymore.  To add to it I tried their new flat bread the mushroom spinach and I'm pretty positive flat bread is suppose to be crispy this was soggy and not completely cooked. It was cold :( I had this ordered curbside and I live 5mins away. I didn't even want to bother to bring it back to be fixed I just won't be coming back. This place is becoming cheap and stingy.

Whitney B.,"Seattle, WA",250,405,696,1.0,7/15/2013,"This place is crap.  And it doesn't even have that mouth-watering smell that a pizza place should have when you first walk in.  I have only been here once and I have since never had any inclination to come back because everything about this place was just flat-out bad.  The only memorable thing about my experience at California Pizza Kitchen was that Ichiro, prior to selling out like A-Rod, came in to eat the same night I did and I was so close I could have hugged him.  This also adds nothing constructive to my review at all. Anyway, between 3 people, we shared the Jamaican Jerk Chicken, Roasted Artichoke and Spinach, and Thai BBQ Chicken pizza.  The Jamaican Jerk Chicken and Thai BBQ Chicken tasted almost exactly the same, meaning it was a tad bit spicy and sweet to the point that it tasted like it was candy.  Really?  Which knuckle head in the kitchen decided that Thai flavor is identical to Jamaican flavor?  They deserve to be out of the culinary industry forever.  There was nothing to the pizza other than it being mind-numbing sweet and spicy.  To top it off, the chicken was rubbery and dry on both pizzas.  It's like they couldn't have made it more obvious they used pre-frozen, pre-cut chicken breast that came straight from a box.   My choice of the Roasted Artichoke and Spinach was no better but in its own way.  I think I could have made a better Roasted Artichoke and Spinach pizza with my butt cheeks and with me being blindfolded at the same time.  The artichokes obviously came from a jar.  Probably Costco.  The sauce had no flavor dimension whatsoever, it was bland as hell.  It had no salt on it to bring out the taste in the artichoke and spinach.  Also they skimped on the vegetables, so you're essentially left with a light layer of cheese and horribly cooked bread.  Worst vegetarian pizza I've ever had.  What the hell?  How do you screw up a vegetarian pizza? Instead of being a consistent, quality chain restaurant like Pagliacci's, it's more like a prepubescent slumber party attempting to make pizzas with an Easy-Bake oven in the back.  While my crust for the Roasted Artichoke and Spinach pizza came out fine, the crust on the Jamaican Jerk Chicken was burnt.  It had too much leftover flour on the bottom, as well.  In all honesty, I hope that they made Ichiro a better pizza than what we had.  I would have rather eaten pizza bites that night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=80

I'm sure some locations put out a little bit of a better pizza, but it's all the same ingredients and recipes. I'm not a fan at all, I've tried several times and just don't like it.

Brad S.,"Redmond, WA",23,50,,3.0,8/13/2007,"Took the wife and 3-year-old daughter here last Friday evening for some CPK.  They had one in Grapevine, Texas, when we lived near there a few years back, so I hadn't been to CPK in a while.  Not much had changed.  Still a very good menu, lots of variety.  Still a bit overpriced, which is part of what keeps me from rating it higher.  I had the Carne Asada pizza, and it was very good.  My daughter loved the water fountain out front, so much so that it was hard to get her to sit down and eat.  My only other complaint is that the place is pretty loud - high ceilings make for a lot of noise, especially on a Friday evening at about 7:00.  Service was a bit slow but that's to be expected in a very busy place.  On the plus side, they did validate parking (otherwise would have been $4), on the downside, they do not take the Prime Card.  All in all, not a bad experience, but for $35, there are better options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=200
Sakshi B.,"Bellevue, WA",0,43,,3.0,4/17/2008,"CPK has often been my go-to place for lunch when i needed a break from the MS cafeteria salads (so bored of them!). I like their Vegetarian special (pizza with goat cheesewithout the japanese eggplant thogh-that tastes very blah on the pizza), their thai crunch salad (amazing!) and their recent new addition-the wonderfully crisp and fresh Miso salad. My only complaint: there was not a trace of avocado in the miso salad i ordered yesterday (and this is weird-because i have this one so often, i know it really well!). The edamame, cucumbers, subtle sweet and tangy dressing-all perfect except i sorely mr avocado. Especially because that is one of the key ingredients they list in the menu for this salad. Oh well-maybe they ran out of it one time. I also love sneaking a taste of hubby's favorite: the Mango Tandoori Chicken pizza (after i remove the chicken bits off it). Oh yeah-and they do have some great mojitos and their baked tortilla starters (with 3 choices of fillings) are super! My only problem with CPK is that it becomes a little boring every now and then. They don't update their menu too often (and when they do-they get rid of old favorites-like the pear an gorgonzola pizza that vanished unannounced!) and the ambience is so ho-hum.  I gotta say though: the quality of CPK food here in bellevue was wayy wayy better than the food i had at CPK Hollywood (or again- i just choose the wrong days to show up huh?!) Tip to avoid having a long wait at lunch: use their call-ahead service to get on the list 15 minutes before u expect to get there. They usually get you seated right away when you reach. ******Update: The Pear and Gorgonzola Pizza is back, and it is delish!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=200

Other than that, no big complaints. I started with the Waldorf salad which was much better than I expected, with surprisingly distinct flavors and delightfully crisp apples. The greens were a slight bit mushy and there was a touch too much dressing, but the flavor was still fantastic. I got the Jamaican Jerk Chicken pizza as an entree, which was delicious. The pieces of meat were spiced just right, and complemented the other flavors instead of drowning them out. Then I tried a piece of my friends BBQ chicken pizza - WOW. Probably because it's their signature dish, this was incredible, tasty, sweet, and soft. Service was nice and quick, my soda cup was barely half-empty before the waiter noticed and brought another (free) refill.

Tom J.,"Everett, WA",0,8,,1.0,2/2/2012,"I'm not sure why everyone seems to like this restaurant.  Other than I used to...  Last Saturday night my family and I decided to go because we knew we could get some good food for dinner.  HUGE MISTAKE!!!! Here is my list of complaints... :( 1.  For some reason they no longer serve beef pizza.  This is not good for someone that doesn't eat chicken or pork.  Those seem to be the only 2 meats on the menu. 2.  The wedge salads were unacceptable.  These I did pay for because we did eat them.  The lettuce was not clean and there were purple egg whites in my wife's salad. 3. I overheard one of the waitresses telling a table near us that she would have to check to see if a particular pizza was available as they hadn't taken enough skins out of the freezer.  Really????  You use frozen skins in your restaurant????  I worked in hospitality for over 20 years including 3 as a pizza dough boy (I made fresh dough every day)  I can't imagine that a major chain would use frozen dough... 3.  When we did get our dinner, a cheese pizza, there was more grease on it than came out of the Gulf Oil spill... Another pizza (after 1 bite) had the blandest tasting sauce I have ever had in my life.  It was almost as if the restaurant didn't want us to eat there and never eat there again.  I told the waitress that I refused to pay for this garbage.  None of  food was good enough to pay for.   I did pay for the salads and drinks.  Then promptly went somewhere else.  You should too... A manager never came over to hear our concerns or to attempt to right the massive wrong.  I did send mail to their Corporate office and was told that I would be hearing from a manager.  This was almost a week ago and nothing. I'm saddened that you can buy one of their frozen pizzas in the grocery store and it tastes better than it does in the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=160
Anthony C.,"Bothell, WA",94,131,136,3.0,6/8/2008,"i have spent many evenings dining at a CPK in California, but never here in Washington.

It was saturday evening around 545p when we put our name on the to be seated list and waited about 30 minutes to be seated...OUCH!!!!  Why are people waiting to be seated at a CPK?  The service was decent and what you would expect, hurried and basically cordial. The manager on duty stopped by to see how we were doing, which was nice. The food was exactly the same here in WA state as it is in California, so thats a good thing for them when it comes to consistency across states lines... If you are looking for a unique flavor in a pizza and good salads that will break your diet, then CPK is for you. I give them 3 stars based off the OK service, OK wait times... the food is a solid 3 because it is just good. nothing great stands out, but they do offer interesting flavors from the standard pizza and salad",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=160

Sara C.,"New Ulm, MN",11,72,,4.0,4/19/2008,"CPK is a standby restaurant for me: if I'm in an unfamiliar city, I seek out the CPK first and explore later. I LOVE so many dishes at CPK, and not just the pizza either: the spinach-artichoke dip, any pasta, and the strawberry lemonade is a perfect combination of sweet and tangy. I like many of their pizzas as well, too many to list here, and I can't remember them all either.  :-)  The one with yukon potatoes comes to mind, as does the one withe eggplant slices. Atmosphere: mehhhh.  Don't go between 6-8pm on a Friday or Saturday, or you will be waiting for at least 10 minutes and shouting at your dinner companions.  CPK is also a magnet for bratty, loud children, which I frankly despise.  Going later in the evenings is always better, for service and noise levels.  Service even at busy times is attentive. One of my favorite staple chain restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=160
Zannah B.,"Bellevue, WA",1,12,,1.0,7/14/2013,"We used to really like CPK. It was a regular in our eating our rotation. However, in August 2012 someone at their corporate office starting messing with what worked. Now the place is no longer a rotation regular and after tonight's awful experience not an even an option.  1. Uniform changes- not a major issue you think- think again.  Tonight one big issue was no one wore name tags. This would not be an issue if they wore some type of uniform so I could tell who worked at the restaurant and who did not. The outfit used to be black slacks and a logo dress shirt of some type with a name tag. Now the outfit is jeans- any color- and any color dress shirt with no logo and no name tag.  Tonight the service was so slow guests were getting up and searching the restaurant for someone to wait on them.  Also you used to be able to tell who was a manager. Generally the person with the tie and the name tag that said Bob and Manager on it. Now it is anyone's guess who is running the place as no one identified themselves as a manager during our meal.  2. When you arrive at the restaurant there used to be glass panels between the booths and the waiting area. This prevented you from having some curious child reach over into your booth while you were eating to investigate. It also gave you some semblance of privacy while dining even if the panels were clear glass. Now the panels are gone and you are left with the curious adults, those who love to ogle what you are eating, and their long armed children to pester you while dining. The panels need to go back up. 3. The food is $2-$4 higher than it used to be. Many items were dumped off the menu or changed in a way that makes it so one does not order it any longer without compunction. The Thai Crunch Salad was a favorite of mine. I can't have peanuts so I always ordered it with the Lime/Cilantro dressing instead. Well, now if you want to order it, it only comes with the peanut dressing. Sorry if you have allergies but CPK does not care.  The Jamaican Jerk Pizza, you either love it or hate it, is a heavy pizza. I mean the toppings are heavy. Why on earth would you put heavy toppings on a thin crust pizza? I ordered it not knowing it had been relegated to thin crust pizza list and spent an annoying evening reloading toppings back onto the pizza slices. Mental note now anytime I want to order it I have to ask for the original crust.  4. Table settings- CPK is not a fine dining establishment. It is a higher end pizza place in a causal atmosphere. One of the changes made were the napkins from black cloth to recycled brown paper. What a letdown. The napkins look cheap and you only get one and have to beg for more. I preferred the cloth napkins.  Then we have two large wine glasses set on the end of each table along with some annoying trifold advert for this month's specials. All items set at the end of dining tables automatically get moved to the back of the table. I know some marketing person claims otherwise but it is annoying and should be stopped. It does not motivate me to have wine with my lunch or to purchase the meal of the week. Trifold adverts remind of me of Denny's and their forever sticky dessert menus at the back of the table. YUCK!  5. Upon being seated you are no longer handed one menu, with possibly a drink menu. No, you are now handed no less than three menus and sometimes more depending on who is working in the sales and marketing departments that week. I honestly do not want to be handed several menus. I want to be handed one menu and have a drink menu placed at the end of the table. Otherwise the collection of the menus is now this size layering task for the server instead of a simple collection process. Just put the options on the menu!  Finally, our dinner experience this evening. What a travesty! I honestly felt as if I was in the Twilight Zone and dining with Gordon Ramsay on Kitchen Nightmares.  Three out of four items we tried to order they were out of.  We found this out at the initial order, then when the waitress returned 10 minutes later and then while my husband attempted to order something different. At that point our server told him what they did not have and then pointed out the two items they did have. Numerous guests got up and searched for someone, anyone to take their order, get them a drink or just show up and say ""Hi, I am your wait person"". Food took 30-40 minutes to make its way out of the kitchen. Some food items came out of the kitchen clearly ready for compost and not fit to be served to a guest. The guest behind us was told ""Your server is very busy right now but I can take your drink orders for them,"" this after I know they had been seated and waiting at least 15-20 minutes.  At no point did a manager appear and again no one wore a distinguishing uniform or a name tag so who knows who did what under what title.  At no point was anyone offered a discount or complimentary beverages for the lengthy wait time.  We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=160

nate j.,"Renton, WA",53,257,66,3.0,8/13/2007,"Worth checking out but not nearly as special as it was hyped out to be.   Relatives and friends have habitually gushed about how great this place is and while I wasn't disappointed by my lunchtime visit, I certainly did not think it garnered the high degree of accolades I'd heard. Generally good points: it has a pretty wide variety of menu offerings to suit many diners' preferences.   Service was prompt, although as with any decent establishment, there was a 10-15 minute wait for a table for 3 at 1PM.  Outdoor dining is available, but it is shaded during the lunch hour.  I wasn't sure if this was due to how the restaurant is situated or if it was due to the large number of high-rise office and residential buildings going up nearby.   Food tasted better than average but there was what seemed to be a longer than typical wait from the time the order was put in to the time it arrived.  We had two pizzas... a regular pepperoni and a Sicilian.  And one of us had a chicken lettuce wrap.  For a starter, we shared (sesame ginger?) chicken won tons.  Generally good stuff.        Neutral: parking is validated for 2 hours, and with the wait for the table and food we needed every second of that 2 hours to complete our lunch.   This might be a better place for a day out shopping lunch than a serious, quick weekday, workday meal.  It would have been nice if the server had offered up some favorites from the menu or even if they'd asked if this was my first visit, etc.   As it was, a portion of our party was delayed, so I got to know the menu pretty well by the time we were set to order.   Other observations: while there were some really casual dressers here (like cut-offs, t-shirt, and flip flops) most were office casual and a few were ""real estate chic"" (flip through the glam shots agents feature with their real estate ads in ""Homes & Land"" magazine and you'll know what I mean).   The parking lot spaces are very tight.  Please leave the Escalade at home for this trip... take the Prius. Best thing about CPK: I didn't hear one single server sing happy birthday to anybody.   Bottom line: if I'm in the area and have a craving for pizza that's outside of the typical with good flavor and casual atmosphere, etc.  I'd give the place a shot.  I just wouldn't fight through I-405 traffic to go out of my way to eat here.

Adrienne H.,"Kirkland, WA",175,212,94,5.0,2/26/2007,"I'm a fan, what can I say?! I consider myself a total pizza snob, but when I order their crazily concocted pizzas, I'm not expecting your typical pepperoni and cheese. I have recently discovered their fabulous Greek pizza.  Basically flatbread with grilled chicken and cheese, then topped with tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, kalamata olives and tzaiki sauce.  It doesn't taste at all like pizza, but I dont expect it to! I love it.   My fiance' had their Neopolitan Thin Style pizza crust with their Pepperoni Pomodoro, and it was excellent, even tasted like ""pizza"". For an appetizer the Tortilla Spring rolls are great, our favorites are the Baja Chicken Torilla rolls! Yummmmm! Another good recommendation I can make is their Kung Pao Spaghetti! The only thing I can say bad about the place is the volume.  Its so damn loud in there, and its usually FULL of kids at around 7pm.  Many of them go there for birthdays, or after softball games, etc.  Its LOUD.  If you go during peak times Friday-Sunday, expect to wait, a LONG LONG time.

Some of their food is great!  I go for their Thai Chicken Pizza--an unexpectedly delicious taste of cilantro, carrots, chicken, peanuts, etc.  It's fantastic, easily my favorite plate there.  I'm a little disappointed that the julienned carrots look to be a few days old (shriveled), but everything else on the pizza is gold. The salads aren't half-bad either.  But I would recommend getting the dressing on the side as they like to douse the greens in the stuff. Every table is given a stack of white bread slices and butter, but the bread is always, always, always dry and not fresh.  It's a source of disappointment for me. The staff is friendly enough.  Maybe one out of every five times I go, I get someone with no personality.  Not bad odds for a chain restaurant.

Stay away from big chain restaurants (boring food, one size fit all restaurant setting, service,etc) 2. Stay away from restaurant offering `everthing everyone may like or want'.  This shows me the restaurant has absolutely no speciality or very hard to keep everything tastes good.  Finally food turns out average. period.

I ordered Chicken Tequila Fettuccine, i know it is risky choice. The best is the spanish fettuccine isn't over cooked, but it is just green pasta, that's all.  Description says it has pasta, chicken, and peppers in it.  Sorry i can't hardly find any chicken breast chunks, more pepper obviously, very out of balance.  Tequila-lime and jalapeño cream sauce is too heavy, oily and thick that there isn't much coating over the pasta.  Overall taste is blend, not the worst pasta dish i have ever had but far from the passing line either.

Both were as delicious as I remembered them being from my last visit. I'm not sure what it is about the crust, but CPK's is just the right crust for me -- it's not greasy by any definition, it's cooked but not crispy. It's fabulous. I have been disappointed by the pastas in the past [namely the price being high for a small dish] but the pizzas never fail to please.

Receiving adequate service for a group that large despite all the hustle and bustle is commendable. The second time I visited with a group of 10, everyone ordered the honey wheat pizza crust only to find that CPK had run out. A manager came out to personally apologize.

We decided to go to California Pizza Kitchen as it is ""teen friendly""....my kids like the pizza there which is good for me so I don't have to hear complaints while I am enjoying my wine. When we arrived at 6ish there was a note on the door that said ""No Pizza"" which is odd since it is after all California PIZZA Kitchen. Well okay fine because we like pasta also and they make a decent sandwich. After waiting 20 minutes for a table we are seated. As we wait and wait and wait and wait for our water (another 20 minutes) our harried waitress takes our drink order. Then we wait and wait and wait and wait and she comes back (sans drinks) and asks for our order. My kids want pasta, she says that is fine but the wait for pasta is approx 30 minutes as the kitchen is backed up. I am thinking well maybe we should order a bottle of wine and have an appetizer. Then Wayne orders a sandwich, no they are out of bread and have no sandwiches, ok well what about the hummus plate, no they are out of pita. So what DID they have??? Salad and pasta with a minimum wait of 30 minutes. Me thinks they should have closed the doors and waited until they had the items on the menu. This is a chain after all..........but they did not and tried to make a buck. We said the buck stops here and we walked. What is surprising most of all is they did not TRY for our business. They should have at least comped an appetizer or something to put us in their good graces.....alas they did not.

Matt C.,"Bellevue, WA",0,1,,1.0,12/29/2012,"California Pizza Kitchen has jumped the shark. Don't bother. They've moved away from their old delicious pizzas and now pizza seems like almost an afterthought on their menu or something they're ashamed of. They've moved to traditional pizzas like ""Canadian bacon & pineapple"" and other standard toppings. For this type of pizza surely every city has many better restaurants than CPK.  In the past they had many innovative pizzas. At one time I used to love the Philly cheese steak pizza, the carne asada pizza, the buffalo chicken pizza, and the greek pizza. All of these pizzas have been removed from the menu over the years and have been replaced with boring versions of traditional topping pizzas. There is one good remaining pizza, the California club, but I don't think it's worth going to the restaurant for that particular pizza when that's the only interesting one left.  The Jamaican Jerk pizza is still there but that's just not a good tasting pizza. It sounds like it should be good, but it isn't. It's like if you mixed Aunt Jemima syrup and habanero peppers and put them on a pizza. It's like Aunt Jemima is finally getting revenge on your tongue for allowing the negative stereotype to continue. The BBQ chicken is good, but the frozen one is almost as good (which is actually pretty amazing to me) so just go to the grocery store and pay half the price or less. So unless you're really into the salmon or the tacos or whatever it is CPK has replaced pizza with that week, try another restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=120

The Mac & Cheese for the little guy was the star of the afternoon though.  It shone through & helped CPK go up a star too.  It comes with a beverage, and we also paid $.49 more for edamame in it.  The reason I had to get the Mac & Cheese for the little guy is because I heard that it was really good on the Men's Room on KISW.  I thought it was better than my pizza.  : )  Maritess thought it was so good that she ordered one for herself.  : ) The service was ok.  Our server was a bit inattentive, but the service wasn't terrible.  It wasn't great either.  But, I can't knock CPK too much because they _are_ kid friendly.

I also feel like service was especially good because of my status, and it's nice to see people so thankful for the men and women in uniform. I ordered a Sicilian pizza, and the rest of my family ordered a Hawaiian barbecue chicken to share. The waitress told us that we could always get more later, and that the pizzas don't take very long to make. That was a surprisingly accurate statement. In a few minutes, they brought out slices of bread and butter as an appetizer. The pizzas came only a few minutes after that, and they were a bit better than what I was expecting. In terms of quality, it's a little above average, but it's still just pizza. I think I actually liked the pizza that I didn't order more; the Hawaiian barbecue chicken pizza was an interesting blend of pineapple, barbecue sauce, and chicken. It's no surprise given the name, but I liked how it was less generic. The Sicilian pizza had a saltier flavor with the salami and ham. I feel like it's not quite worth the fourteen-dollar price tag that I would have paid, but it's still not bad. I don't want to give five stars because it's nothing exceptional. Pizza is more or less the same across the board, but here it feels a little less greasy and the service is good.

If you're shopping at Bellevue Square, it's convenient to park in the mall's garage and walk over.  I visited for lunch with a friend around 1:00pm on a Saturday and the restaurant was about half full. CPK has many unique pizza options in addition to classic ones and pastas / other entrees.   We ordered two items to share: **Original BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad (half-size):  In addition to lettuce, tomato and chicken pieces, it included tortilla strips, BBQ sauce, scallions and cilantro, all tossed in a well-balanced herb ranch dressing. Although pricey, we added avocado for an additional $2. This was easily one of the most flavorful salads I have ever had - it was so fresh and crisp with a nice smokiness from the chicken. ** Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pizza: Similar to ingredients in a burrito bowl, it was topped with chicken, shaved poblano peppers, Monterey Jack, roasted corn / black bean salsa, cilantro and a chipotle adobo sauce. A lime crema sauce was served on the side to drizzle on top which tames the heat. I found this pizza to be spicier than expected but I really enjoyed it.  It actually did remind me of a burrito bowl from Chipotle, but just on bread instead of rice. The crust is nice and thin and completely full of toppings. Together, all the ingredients melded into a delicious southwestern flavor. I consider the pizza an ideal size for two people. As lighter-eaters, between two of us, we still had about three slices of pizza leftover to take home.

Elbert F.,"Redmond, United States",1,3,,2.0,6/12/2017,"Very underwhelmed by the service. Last night I came in with my family (wife and 3 kids) to dinner for the first time. Being a first time customer I really didn't have any expectations but not in a million years did I think service would be that deficient. For starters they gave the kids those kid's menus that have activities but when we inquired about crayons they said they'd run out since Thanksgiving! Having the activity book with nothing to write with made the kids even more restless than if they had not received anything in the first place. That aside we ordered drinks (including lemonade for the now restless kids) and it took them almost 20 minutes to bring! All this while the restaurant was, at best, half full. After this waitress took our order (pizzas and an appetizer) and the waiting game began once more..after about 20 minutes they brought our pizzas out and when we inquired about the missing ( and quite frankly unwanted by this point) appetizer we were informed that they'd run out!!! How the waitress couldn't come and inform us of this BEFORE bringing our food out is something that escapes me completely. To top it off once we were done with the pizzas and asked for the check we, once more, had to wait more than 10 minutes to be charged. Don't get me wrong; the waitress was very courteous and apologetic and I actually felt bad for her but I fail to understand how a simple pizza and appetizer dinner could've taken so long to complete in a restaurant that was barely half full on a weeknight...That said, I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue
Catherine M.,"Brier, United States",282,146,236,1.0,18/10/2017,"Down with CPK! A few weeks back I used a coupon from a friend (which hilariously and ironically didn't save me money but cost me more - good job marketing team, I see you). We showed up like 20 minutes before closing to place a pretty simple take out order. Attitude across the board between the bartender/takeout guy and the manager. I don't blame them for being tired and cranky, so that didn't really matter. But the food, the food matters. And the food we got sucked.  I will say the Italian chopped salad was and always has been good. The Kung pao chicken and shrimp spaghetti was a let down- small and no doubt overpriced, considering the meats add-on costs I think $7 and the portion size is truly that of a decorative garnish.. The most infuriating part of getting home with our take out was opening the pizza (Cali Cobb pizza)---- this was supposed to be the main event. And, there in the box was this little crusty thing with some cheese on it; the toppings came separate!!! (As if this is an effing toy I'm supposed to build at home) so there I am, after raving to my friend about how good the food is here, and now I'm equal parts embarrassed and disappointed. But I build my pizza (i.e. Lay out the slices of tomato, avocado, and mix the iceberg lettuce with its aoli, then top the pie with all this. With my bare hands. Cuz the chef couldn't do it. Because... the pizzas gonna get soggy...? Sure, whatever) one last thing about that pizza, a few years ago it was to die for and one of the highlights of it was the arugula they topped it with, which like I said is now a cheaper mix of iceberg. In summary, quality and value has all around fallen out the back of the truck.  It was a waste of $45. We sorta picked at it and spent most of the meal talking about how much of a let down it was.

Lunch here most of the time is smooth and parking can be validated to avoid some charges. The pizza is good...not amazing or anything but it hits the spot. I'd suggest The Works or Sicilian as safe picks for pizza. For salads, maybe a Waldorf or Italian Chopped will whet your appetite for the main courses--don't forget sourdough bread.  Personally, I opt for the Ribeye or Halibut/Salmon with some quinoa on the side and the lady usually gets the Shrimp Scampi Zucchini.

If you're shopping at Bellevue Square, it's convenient to park in the mall's garage and walk over.  I visited for lunch with a friend around 1:00pm on a Saturday and the restaurant was about half full. CPK has many unique pizza options in addition to classic ones and pastas / other entrees.   We ordered two items to share: **Original BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad (half-size):  In addition to lettuce, tomato and chicken pieces, it included tortilla strips, BBQ sauce, scallions and cilantro, all tossed in a well-balanced herb ranch dressing. Although pricey, we added avocado for an additional $2. This was easily one of the most flavorful salads I have ever had - it was so fresh and crisp with a nice smokiness from the chicken. ** Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pizza: Similar to ingredients in a burrito bowl, it was topped with chicken, shaved poblano peppers, Monterey Jack, roasted corn / black bean salsa, cilantro and a chipotle adobo sauce. A lime crema sauce was served on the side to drizzle on top which tames the heat. I found this pizza to be spicier than expected but I really enjoyed it.  It actually did remind me of a burrito bowl from Chipotle, but just on bread instead of rice. The crust is nice and thin and completely full of toppings. Together, all the ingredients melded into a delicious southwestern flavor. I consider the pizza an ideal size for two people. As lighter-eaters, between two of us, we still had about three slices of pizza leftover to take home. I enjoyed my experience here, but I would consider it a little pricier than expected.. our pizza was around $13 and adding avocado to our salad was an extra $2.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=20

Military personnel get a free pizza and drink here on this day. That's definitely not my primary reason for being a soldier, but I really appreciate this kind of deal! I also feel like service was especially good because of my status, and it's nice to see people so thankful for the men and women in uniform. I ordered a Sicilian pizza, and the rest of my family ordered a Hawaiian barbecue chicken to share. The waitress told us that we could always get more later, and that the pizzas don't take very long to make. That was a surprisingly accurate statement. In a few minutes, they brought out slices of bread and butter as an appetizer. The pizzas came only a few minutes after that, and they were a bit better than what I was expecting. In terms of quality, it's a little above average, but it's still just pizza. I think I actually liked the pizza that I didn't order more; the Hawaiian barbecue chicken pizza was an interesting blend of pineapple, barbecue sauce, and chicken. It's no surprise given the name, but I liked how it was less generic. The Sicilian pizza had a saltier flavor with the salami and ham. I feel like it's not quite worth the fourteen-dollar price tag that I would have paid, but it's still not bad. I don't want to give five stars because it's nothing exceptional. Pizza is more or less the same across the board, but here it feels a little less greasy and the service is good.

Whitney B.,"Seattle, United States",250,405,696,1.0,15/7/2013,"This place is crap.  And it doesn't even have that mouth-watering smell that a pizza place should have when you first walk in.  I have only been here once and I have since never had any inclination to come back because everything about this place was just flat-out bad.  The only memorable thing about my experience at California Pizza Kitchen was that Ichiro, prior to selling out like A-Rod, came in to eat the same night I did and I was so close I could have hugged him.  This also adds nothing constructive to my review at all. Anyway, between 3 people, we shared the Jamaican Jerk Chicken, Roasted Artichoke and Spinach, and Thai BBQ Chicken pizza.  The Jamaican Jerk Chicken and Thai BBQ Chicken tasted almost exactly the same, meaning it was a tad bit spicy and sweet to the point that it tasted like it was candy.  Really?  Which knuckle head in the kitchen decided that Thai flavor is identical to Jamaican flavor?  They deserve to be out of the culinary industry forever.  There was nothing to the pizza other than it being mind-numbing sweet and spicy.  To top it off, the chicken was rubbery and dry on both pizzas.  It's like they couldn't have made it more obvious they used pre-frozen, pre-cut chicken breast that came straight from a box.   My choice of the Roasted Artichoke and Spinach was no better but in its own way.  I think I could have made a better Roasted Artichoke and Spinach pizza with my butt cheeks and with me being blindfolded at the same time.  The artichokes obviously came from a jar.  Probably Costco.  The sauce had no flavor dimension whatsoever, it was bland as hell.  It had no salt on it to bring out the taste in the artichoke and spinach.  Also they skimped on the vegetables, so you're essentially left with a light layer of cheese and horribly cooked bread.  Worst vegetarian pizza I've ever had.  What the hell?  How do you screw up a vegetarian pizza? Instead of being a consistent, quality chain restaurant like Pagliacci's, it's more like a prepubescent slumber party attempting to make pizzas with an Easy-Bake oven in the back.  While my crust for the Roasted Artichoke and Spinach pizza came out fine, the crust on the Jamaican Jerk Chicken was burnt.  It had too much leftover flour on the bottom, as well.  In all honesty, I hope that they made Ichiro a better pizza than what we had.  I would have rather eaten pizza bites that night.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=80

In the past they had many innovative pizzas. At one time I used to love the Philly cheese steak pizza, the carne asada pizza, the buffalo chicken pizza, and the greek pizza. All of these pizzas have been removed from the menu over the years and have been replaced with boring versions of traditional topping pizzas. There is one good remaining pizza, the California club, but I don't think it's worth going to the restaurant for that particular pizza when that's the only interesting one left.  The Jamaican Jerk pizza is still there but that's just not a good tasting pizza. It sounds like it should be good, but it isn't. It's like if you mixed Aunt Jemima syrup and habanero peppers and put them on a pizza. It's like Aunt Jemima is finally getting revenge on your tongue for allowing the negative stereotype to continue. The BBQ chicken is good, but the frozen one is almost as good (which is actually pretty amazing to me) so just go to the grocery store and pay half the price or less. So unless you're really into the salmon or the tacos or whatever it is CPK has replaced pizza with that week, try another restaurant.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=120

The crust was still legit.  The cheese was nice and melted, YUM!  The chicken actually tasted better the 2nd day.  Sauce was lovely, and the red onions gave it a subtle kick. As a part of my dinner, I ate the remaining goat cheese pizza and Thai tortilla spring roll.  The pizza was still awesome, caramelized onions= LOVE.  Like the chicken on the BBQ pizza, the spring roll tasted better, the 2nd day.  Who knows why?

The Mac & Cheese for the little guy was the star of the afternoon though.  It shone through & helped CPK go up a star too.  It comes with a beverage, and we also paid $.49 more for edamame in it.  The reason I had to get the Mac & Cheese for the little guy is because I heard that it was really good on the Men's Room on KISW.  I thought it was better than my pizza.  : )  Maritess thought it was so good that she ordered one for herself.  : ) The service was ok.  Our server was a bit inattentive, but the service wasn't terrible.  It wasn't great either.  But, I can't knock CPK too much because they _are_ kid friendly.

Other than that, no big complaints. I started with the Waldorf salad which was much better than I expected, with surprisingly distinct flavors and delightfully crisp apples. The greens were a slight bit mushy and there was a touch too much dressing, but the flavor was still fantastic. I got the Jamaican Jerk Chicken pizza as an entree, which was delicious. The pieces of meat were spiced just right, and complemented the other flavors instead of drowning them out. Then I tried a piece of my friends BBQ chicken pizza - WOW. Probably because it's their signature dish, this was incredible, tasty, sweet, and soft. Service was nice and quick, my soda cup was barely half-empty before the waiter noticed and brought another (free) refill.

Tom J.,"Everett, United States",0,8,,1.0,2/2/2012,"I'm not sure why everyone seems to like this restaurant.  Other than I used to...  Last Saturday night my family and I decided to go because we knew we could get some good food for dinner.  HUGE MISTAKE!!!! Here is my list of complaints... :( 1.  For some reason they no longer serve beef pizza.  This is not good for someone that doesn't eat chicken or pork.  Those seem to be the only 2 meats on the menu. 2.  The wedge salads were unacceptable.  These I did pay for because we did eat them.  The lettuce was not clean and there were purple egg whites in my wife's salad. 3. I overheard one of the waitresses telling a table near us that she would have to check to see if a particular pizza was available as they hadn't taken enough skins out of the freezer.  Really????  You use frozen skins in your restaurant????  I worked in hospitality for over 20 years including 3 as a pizza dough boy (I made fresh dough every day)  I can't imagine that a major chain would use frozen dough... 3.  When we did get our dinner, a cheese pizza, there was more grease on it than came out of the Gulf Oil spill... Another pizza (after 1 bite) had the blandest tasting sauce I have ever had in my life.  It was almost as if the restaurant didn't want us to eat there and never eat there again.  I told the waitress that I refused to pay for this garbage.  None of  food was good enough to pay for.   I did pay for the salads and drinks.  Then promptly went somewhere else.  You should too... A manager never came over to hear our concerns or to attempt to right the massive wrong.  I did send mail to their Corporate office and was told that I would be hearing from a manager.  This was almost a week ago and nothing. I'm saddened that you can buy one of their frozen pizzas in the grocery store and it tastes better than it does in the restaurant.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=160
Anthony C.,"Bothell, United States",94,131,136,3.0,8/6/2008,"i have spent many evenings dining at a CPK in California, but never here in Washington.

It was saturday evening around 545p when we put our name on the to be seated list and waited about 30 minutes to be seated...OUCH!!!!  Why are people waiting to be seated at a CPK?  The service was decent and what you would expect, hurried and basically cordial. The manager on duty stopped by to see how we were doing, which was nice. The food was exactly the same here in WA state as it is in California, so thats a good thing for them when it comes to consistency across states lines... If you are looking for a unique flavor in a pizza and good salads that will break your diet, then CPK is for you. I give them 3 stars based off the OK service, OK wait times... the food is a solid 3 because it is just good. nothing great stands out, but they do offer interesting flavors from the standard pizza and salad",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=160

Sara C.,"New Ulm, United States",11,72,,4.0,19/4/2008,"CPK is a standby restaurant for me: if I'm in an unfamiliar city, I seek out the CPK first and explore later. I LOVE so many dishes at CPK, and not just the pizza either: the spinach-artichoke dip, any pasta, and the strawberry lemonade is a perfect combination of sweet and tangy. I like many of their pizzas as well, too many to list here, and I can't remember them all either.  :-)  The one with yukon potatoes comes to mind, as does the one withe eggplant slices. Atmosphere: mehhhh.  Don't go between 6-8pm on a Friday or Saturday, or you will be waiting for at least 10 minutes and shouting at your dinner companions.  CPK is also a magnet for bratty, loud children, which I frankly despise.  Going later in the evenings is always better, for service and noise levels.  Service even at busy times is attentive. One of my favorite staple chain restaurants.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=160
Zannah B.,"Bellevue, United States",1,12,,1.0,14/7/2013,"We used to really like CPK. It was a regular in our eating our rotation. However, in August 2012 someone at their corporate office starting messing with what worked. Now the place is no longer a rotation regular and after tonight's awful experience not an even an option.  1. Uniform changes- not a major issue you think- think again.  Tonight one big issue was no one wore name tags. This would not be an issue if they wore some type of uniform so I could tell who worked at the restaurant and who did not. The outfit used to be black slacks and a logo dress shirt of some type with a name tag. Now the outfit is jeans- any color- and any color dress shirt with no logo and no name tag.  Tonight the service was so slow guests were getting up and searching the restaurant for someone to wait on them.  Also you used to be able to tell who was a manager. Generally the person with the tie and the name tag that said Bob and Manager on it. Now it is anyone's guess who is running the place as no one identified themselves as a manager during our meal.  2. When you arrive at the restaurant there used to be glass panels between the booths and the waiting area. This prevented you from having some curious child reach over into your booth while you were eating to investigate. It also gave you some semblance of privacy while dining even if the panels were clear glass. Now the panels are gone and you are left with the curious adults, those who love to ogle what you are eating, and their long armed children to pester you while dining. The panels need to go back up. 3. The food is $2-$4 higher than it used to be. Many items were dumped off the menu or changed in a way that makes it so one does not order it any longer without compunction. The Thai Crunch Salad was a favorite of mine. I can't have peanuts so I always ordered it with the Lime/Cilantro dressing instead. Well, now if you want to order it, it only comes with the peanut dressing. Sorry if you have allergies but CPK does not care.  The Jamaican Jerk Pizza, you either love it or hate it, is a heavy pizza. I mean the toppings are heavy. Why on earth would you put heavy toppings on a thin crust pizza? I ordered it not knowing it had been relegated to thin crust pizza list and spent an annoying evening reloading toppings back onto the pizza slices. Mental note now anytime I want to order it I have to ask for the original crust.  4. Table settings- CPK is not a fine dining establishment. It is a higher end pizza place in a causal atmosphere. One of the changes made were the napkins from black cloth to recycled brown paper. What a letdown. The napkins look cheap and you only get one and have to beg for more. I preferred the cloth napkins.  Then we have two large wine glasses set on the end of each table along with some annoying trifold advert for this month's specials. All items set at the end of dining tables automatically get moved to the back of the table. I know some marketing person claims otherwise but it is annoying and should be stopped. It does not motivate me to have wine with my lunch or to purchase the meal of the week. Trifold adverts remind of me of Denny's and their forever sticky dessert menus at the back of the table. YUCK!  5. Upon being seated you are no longer handed one menu, with possibly a drink menu. No, you are now handed no less than three menus and sometimes more depending on who is working in the sales and marketing departments that week. I honestly do not want to be handed several menus. I want to be handed one menu and have a drink menu placed at the end of the table. Otherwise the collection of the menus is now this size layering task for the server instead of a simple collection process. Just put the options on the menu!  Finally, our dinner experience this evening. What a travesty! I honestly felt as if I was in the Twilight Zone and dining with Gordon Ramsay on Kitchen Nightmares.  Three out of four items we tried to order they were out of.  We found this out at the initial order, then when the waitress returned 10 minutes later and then while my husband attempted to order something different. At that point our server told him what they did not have and then pointed out the two items they did have. Numerous guests got up and searched for someone, anyone to take their order, get them a drink or just show up and say ""Hi, I am your wait person"". Food took 30-40 minutes to make its way out of the kitchen. Some food items came out of the kitchen clearly ready for compost and not fit to be served to a guest. The guest behind us was told ""Your server is very busy right now but I can take your drink orders for them,"" this after I know they had been seated and waiting at least 15-20 minutes.  At no point did a manager appear and again no one wore a distinguishing uniform or a name tag so who knows who did what under what title.  At no point was anyone offered a discount or complimentary beverages for the lengthy wait time.  We won't be back.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=160

nate j.,"Renton, United States",53,257,66,3.0,13/8/2007,"Worth checking out but not nearly as special as it was hyped out to be.   Relatives and friends have habitually gushed about how great this place is and while I wasn't disappointed by my lunchtime visit, I certainly did not think it garnered the high degree of accolades I'd heard. Generally good points: it has a pretty wide variety of menu offerings to suit many diners' preferences.   Service was prompt, although as with any decent establishment, there was a 10-15 minute wait for a table for 3 at 1PM.  Outdoor dining is available, but it is shaded during the lunch hour.  I wasn't sure if this was due to how the restaurant is situated or if it was due to the large number of high-rise office and residential buildings going up nearby.   Food tasted better than average but there was what seemed to be a longer than typical wait from the time the order was put in to the time it arrived.  We had two pizzas... a regular pepperoni and a Sicilian.  And one of us had a chicken lettuce wrap.  For a starter, we shared (sesame ginger?) chicken won tons.  Generally good stuff.        Neutral: parking is validated for 2 hours, and with the wait for the table and food we needed every second of that 2 hours to complete our lunch.   This might be a better place for a day out shopping lunch than a serious, quick weekday, workday meal.  It would have been nice if the server had offered up some favorites from the menu or even if they'd asked if this was my first visit, etc.   As it was, a portion of our party was delayed, so I got to know the menu pretty well by the time we were set to order.   Other observations: while there were some really casual dressers here (like cut-offs, t-shirt, and flip flops) most were office casual and a few were ""real estate chic"" (flip through the glam shots agents feature with their real estate ads in ""Homes & Land"" magazine and you'll know what I mean).   The parking lot spaces are very tight.  Please leave the Escalade at home for this trip... take the Prius. Best thing about CPK: I didn't hear one single server sing happy birthday to anybody.   Bottom line: if I'm in the area and have a craving for pizza that's outside of the typical with good flavor and casual atmosphere, etc.  I'd give the place a shot.  I just wouldn't fight through I-405 traffic to go out of my way to eat here.

Adrienne H.,"Kirkland, United States",175,212,94,5.0,26/2/2007,"I'm a fan, what can I say?! I consider myself a total pizza snob, but when I order their crazily concocted pizzas, I'm not expecting your typical pepperoni and cheese. I have recently discovered their fabulous Greek pizza.  Basically flatbread with grilled chicken and cheese, then topped with tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, kalamata olives and tzaiki sauce.  It doesn't taste at all like pizza, but I dont expect it to! I love it.   My fiance' had their Neopolitan Thin Style pizza crust with their Pepperoni Pomodoro, and it was excellent, even tasted like ""pizza"". For an appetizer the Tortilla Spring rolls are great, our favorites are the Baja Chicken Torilla rolls! Yummmmm! Another good recommendation I can make is their Kung Pao Spaghetti! The only thing I can say bad about the place is the volume.  Its so damn loud in there, and its usually FULL of kids at around 7pm.  Many of them go there for birthdays, or after softball games, etc.  Its LOUD.  If you go during peak times Friday-Sunday, expect to wait, a LONG LONG time.

Some of their food is great!  I go for their Thai Chicken Pizza--an unexpectedly delicious taste of cilantro, carrots, chicken, peanuts, etc.  It's fantastic, easily my favorite plate there.  I'm a little disappointed that the julienned carrots look to be a few days old (shriveled), but everything else on the pizza is gold. The salads aren't half-bad either.  But I would recommend getting the dressing on the side as they like to douse the greens in the stuff. Every table is given a stack of white bread slices and butter, but the bread is always, always, always dry and not fresh.  It's a source of disappointment for me. The staff is friendly enough.  Maybe one out of every five times I go, I get someone with no personality.  Not bad odds for a chain restaurant.

The second time I visited with a group of 10, everyone ordered the honey wheat pizza crust only to find that CPK had run out. A manager came out to personally apologize.

Sean M.,"Newburgh, United States",2,2,,5.0,24/4/2012,"The service and the food both were excellent!  We had a group of 33 people and they didn't make a single mistake!  The general manager came and checked on our group often, and really made us feel like valued guests.  The wait staff was ON IT, keeping our drinks full and ensuring that all the orders were straight.  A great meal and great service made for a great evening!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=180
karen r.,"Bellevue, United States",0,7,,3.0,15/1/2012,I have eaten lunch and dinner here..The pizza-we had wild mushroom and tropical was good-sort of a pretentious west coast yuppie style-but not great.I prefer Topolino's close by-which has a more original garlicy seasoned flavor-New York style.  CPK is a light airy place and I understand why it is always busy.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=180
Melissa S.,"Bellevue, United States",5,27,2,4.0,10/5/2009,My children love this place. The pizzas are just their size although not nearly the selection offered on the adult menu. The prices for the children's meals seem a bit high and yet they do have the most extensive kids menu ever seen. They love the kiwi flavored sodas and sundaes that come with their pizzas. I am a huge fan of the carne asada pizza. I always ask for extra peppers which truly makes it a spicy pizza. I don't recommend ordering a mixed drink. They are medium at best. Stick to wine or beer if you're in the mood for a little something to go along with dinner.  You will walk away satisfied.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=180
Kelly A.,"Mercer Island, United States",563,40,,1.0,9/5/2011,"We went out to celebrate Mother's Day last night. We decided to go to California Pizza Kitchen as it is ""teen friendly""....my kids like the pizza there which is good for me so I don't have to hear complaints while I am enjoying my wine. When we arrived at 6ish there was a note on the door that said ""No Pizza"" which is odd since it is after all California PIZZA Kitchen. Well okay fine because we like pasta also and they make a decent sandwich. After waiting 20 minutes for a table we are seated. As we wait and wait and wait and wait for our water (another 20 minutes) our harried waitress takes our drink order. Then we wait and wait and wait and wait and she comes back (sans drinks) and asks for our order. My kids want pasta, she says that is fine but the wait for pasta is approx 30 minutes as the kitchen is backed up. I am thinking well maybe we should order a bottle of wine and have an appetizer. Then Wayne orders a sandwich, no they are out of bread and have no sandwiches, ok well what about the hummus plate, no they are out of pita. So what DID they have??? Salad and pasta with a minimum wait of 30 minutes. Me thinks they should have closed the doors and waited until they had the items on the menu. This is a chain after all..........but they did not and tried to make a buck. We said the buck stops here and we walked. What is surprising most of all is they did not TRY for our business. They should have at least comped an appetizer or something to put us in their good graces.....alas they did not. I received a$50.00 gift card for Mother's Day as a gift from my mom who did not want me to buy my Mother's Day dinner. I think I am going to put it on ebay.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=180
Marcie C.,"Renton, United States",10,224,5,4.0,21/9/2009,"This is the nicest CPK I've been to! Much better than Northgate, SouthCenter, or DC. Very clean and spacious. The food took awhile to arrive and they didn't give us any bread! This made me a little grouchy :( My Hawaiian pizza was delicious and hit the spot. We ordered the chocolate soufflé, but it ended up being just a brownie and ice cream. Anyone who has tasted a soufflé knows what a letdown that is. I think when you go to CPK you should understand that it's not a traditional pizza joint, but more of a casual dining experience.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=180
Tod B.,"Tukwila, United States",45,79,16,3.0,9/11/2005,"This is a see and be seen place at lunch time, especially in the summer. There is a patio and a constant stream of people walk past on their way to and from the mall. The prices are a little high for lunch, and the food is good, but not amazing. I agree with the other reviewer that the Thai pizza is pretty good.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=180
Katie K.,"Renton, United States",6,187,15,2.0,2/12/2008,I've had better pizza for way less. Here I think you pay more for the atmosphere than good pizza.

Joel G.,"Seattle, United States",15,66,,4.0,8/1/2006,"The Jerk Chicken Pizza was really good, although it ended up being like $14 including tax and tip, which is kind of on the expensive side for lunch.  Bill Gates was sitting a few tables over.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=180
John M.,"Issaquah, United States",5,24,,4.0,15/11/2006,"This is a delightful restaurant across from the Bellevue Galleria Theaters and only a block from the Lincoln Square Theaters. Their pizzas are not your ordinary cheese and tomato sauce variety but the specialty variety like the Milan with Italian sausages, mushrooms, caramelized onions, Fontino, Mozzarella, and Parmesan cheeses, and herbs, or the Margharita. And don't forget their Barbeque Chicken Pizza. They also have a spicy Jambalaya with linguini pasta which is excellent. Their bar has about anything you could want including a good selection of beer both bottled and on tap. This place can get a little crowded, but there is excellent seating at the bar which works well if there are only 2 of you in your party.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=180
Marti O.,"Shawnee Mission, United States",0,53,,4.0,27/9/2010,"Though I've visted several CPK's around the country, my aunt was a CPK virgin. So this was a mandatory stop on our trip. We ordered the BBQ chicken pizza & a cobb salad to split. Both were delicious & we couldn't eat all of the salad. Asked for more dressing as the salad needed it, but the toppings were plentiful. Strawberry lemonade tasted ""instant"".  Our waiter, Jessie, was friendly but disappeared for long periods of time. The bathrooms are downstairs & inconvenient. Look for a tall waiter who resembles Jimmy Smits - he's very nice too!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=180
Adinarayana B.,"Seattle, United States",0,4,,5.0,19/1/2012,we went in there on newyears day for the 1st time and we became fan of their quesadillas..the pizza was delicious too..mexican blend in the pizza was really awesome..can't wait to go there again!!,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=200
Elizabeth E.,"Bellevue, United States",47,43,5,5.0,9/7/2007,"As a vegetarian, all I can say is this place is paradise.  I am used to having only one or two choices in most non ethnic restaurants, but CPK has close to 10 menu items I can eat.  They even have a vegetarian split pea soup!!  I love the spagatini, the fussili with sun dried tomatoes and broccoli, the grilled veggie salad, the pita and hummus, the field greens salad, and this other thing I forget the name but it is sort of like brushetta.  It is always fresh, and the combination of flavors in their dishes burst with flavor.  Ever since I first had their split pea soup, I can never have canned or instant split pea soup again.  I also like some of their drinks, like the raspberry lemon drop, and they have a nice smooth sangria.  They are always busy on Friday and Saturday nights, so it is a long wait, but worth it!  I also like their management team, they are professional and really know how to take care of their staff and customers.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=200
Brad S.,"Redmond, United States",23,50,,3.0,13/8/2007,"Took the wife and 3-year-old daughter here last Friday evening for some CPK.  They had one in Grapevine, Texas, when we lived near there a few years back, so I hadn't been to CPK in a while.  Not much had changed.  Still a very good menu, lots of variety.  Still a bit overpriced, which is part of what keeps me from rating it higher.  I had the Carne Asada pizza, and it was very good.  My daughter loved the water fountain out front, so much so that it was hard to get her to sit down and eat.  My only other complaint is that the place is pretty loud - high ceilings make for a lot of noise, especially on a Friday evening at about 7:00.  Service was a bit slow but that's to be expected in a very busy place.  On the plus side, they did validate parking (otherwise would have been $4), on the downside, they do not take the Prime Card.  All in all, not a bad experience, but for $35, there are better options.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=200
Sakshi B.,"Bellevue, United States",0,43,,3.0,17/4/2008,"CPK has often been my go-to place for lunch when i needed a break from the MS cafeteria salads (so bored of them!). I like their Vegetarian special (pizza with goat cheesewithout the japanese eggplant thogh-that tastes very blah on the pizza), their thai crunch salad (amazing!) and their recent new addition-the wonderfully crisp and fresh Miso salad. My only complaint: there was not a trace of avocado in the miso salad i ordered yesterday (and this is weird-because i have this one so often, i know it really well!). The edamame, cucumbers, subtle sweet and tangy dressing-all perfect except i sorely mr avocado. Especially because that is one of the key ingredients they list in the menu for this salad. Oh well-maybe they ran out of it one time. I also love sneaking a taste of hubby's favorite: the Mango Tandoori Chicken pizza (after i remove the chicken bits off it). Oh yeah-and they do have some great mojitos and their baked tortilla starters (with 3 choices of fillings) are super! My only problem with CPK is that it becomes a little boring every now and then. They don't update their menu too often (and when they do-they get rid of old favorites-like the pear an gorgonzola pizza that vanished unannounced!) and the ambience is so ho-hum.  I gotta say though: the quality of CPK food here in bellevue was wayy wayy better than the food i had at CPK Hollywood (or again- i just choose the wrong days to show up huh?!) Tip to avoid having a long wait at lunch: use their call-ahead service to get on the list 15 minutes before u expect to get there. They usually get you seated right away when you reach. ******Update: The Pear and Gorgonzola Pizza is back, and it is delish!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bellevue?start=200
