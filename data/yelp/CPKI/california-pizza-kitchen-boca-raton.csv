Brian W.,"Miami, FL",106,12,,5.0,11/25/2017,I took the mother of my child and my daughter to this location and it was a great decision. At first I was reluctant to go in because of past experiences I've had at other locations but I was wrong to judge this one without giving it a chance. Suhhel was our server and she was great from start to finish. She also anticipated our needs and we really appreciated her service. Then there was Peri the hostess that was sweet as can be. We talked to Peri for a while and she was very pleasant. We will definitely stop by again in the near future when in the area. Thank you.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boca-raton
Dave H.,"Boca Raton, FL",1178,675,784,2.0,12/28/2017,"Taste: mixed bag, drinks and app good, pizza lacking, I do not think they know what tomato sauce is; Service: mixed bag again, nice waitress with food on her chin, rushing servers with thumbs in the food, glasses dropping several times, this rushing about business does not help them provide good service; Decor: very plain, tight, cramped, outdoor is on the parking lot; Price for quality: over priced by a bit, coupons available; Beers: none worth having.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boca-raton
Betsy S.,"Delray Beach, FL",818,248,1405,3.0,12/3/2017,"Sometimes good, sometimes not. I like it mostly b/c I like their salads. Though I never did understand why they removed their mediterranean chicken salad -it was to die for! Now I do ok with their Chinese chicken salad though I don't love it. We were there yesterday while the manager was firing an employee - not exactly totally professional to do it in front of customers... It's easily accessible in the mall (Boca Town Center) and it is moderately priced. It's good for all ages which is even better! You can also sit outside which in the nice weather is a bonus. (It's located near Nordstrom's).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boca-raton
Cassidy C.,"Boca Raton, FL",332,76,80,4.0,2/27/2017,"I personally really enjoy coming to CPK. The food and service is always good when I come.  They start you off with realllllly good bread and an oil. I'm pretty sure the bread is hot too. I always sit outside because it's less crowded and also better for bigger parties, especially if your party is loud. They do have fans but it's Florida so it does get hot depending on when you go.  The kids menu is pretty good, and the kids Mac & Cheese is amazing. I also always get the Waldorf Chicken Salad with iceberg lettuce, (It doesn't say cheese on the menu but it does come with cheese if you're not a cheese person), and it's very good!! The ""half"" portions are bigger than you would expect. I get half, and I'm full after.  I've never had problems with the service, all the staff that I have met are friendly. If you come to CPK often then I suggest you become a member so you can get points which will lead to discounts or free pizzas!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boca-raton
laura g.,"San Francisco, CA",0,22,5,1.0,11/11/2017,The worst service. Food took forever to arrive and we only ordered pasta and a salad.

Alex Z.,"Orlando, FL",0,20,5,3.0,12/6/2017,Service is pretty hit or miss but the Thai Chicken Pizza is bomb! Always get it with extra sauce on the side to dip the crust in.

Kylie C.,"Boca Raton, FL",212,111,328,4.0,2/26/2017,"Woah ok, so my friends love this place and I was never that big of a fan. BUT once I started ordering things other than the pizza, I started to understand. (Which is ironic)  What I've been ordering is the Thai Crunch salad. It's seriously amazing. It's not like your ordinary salad, you have to try it.  With the salad, depending on how hungry I am because it is pretty filling if you get the full size, I get the Farmers Market soup. Which is this amazing squash soup that has plenty of flavor and really hits the spot.  I hear the tea's are really good! So, you can give that a try! Other than that, I haven't really tried much on the menu. But if you're shopping and need a quick but delicious bite, this place will do it! Not too expensive and plenty of choices on the menu!

Sarah F.,"Boca Raton, FL",67,161,279,5.0,7/9/2016,"In my opinion, CPK always hits the spot. Their menu has options that satisfy any mood you're in. Whenever my friends and I can't pick a place to eat, we end up here. The thai crunch salad is my favorite thing on the menu. It's actually my favorite salad ever. The salad is fresh and has a little bit of a kick in the dressing. I once bought a bottle of the dressing to go... My other fave is their mac and cheese with edamame. You wouldn't think to add edamame to it, but I promise it's fire. Sometimes I get a half salad and a kid's mac, when I crave both of these. I have never had a complaint with this location. The service is great and the food is delicious. Definitely one of my favorite places for a casual lunch or dinner. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boca-raton
Ashley D.,"Boca Raton, FL",3,8,3,2.0,11/3/2017,We arrived at 9pm on a Wednesday night.  They close at 9:30.  The hostess seemed very reluctant to seat us and told us the kitchen would not be happy with us arriving so late.   There were many other customers in the restaurant.  We sat down and the server even had an attitude.  We ordered drinks but decided after that to leave.  It is unfortunate that the claim certain hours but really don't expect to serve during the entire open hours.  We will not likely return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boca-raton

Julie C.,"Lake Worth, FL",133,53,23,4.0,4/11/2017,"Love love love CPK. Their broccolini is my favorite thing!!! I come here a lot because the menu has a lot of different things on it that I enjoy. I don't get the same thing every time but I do get that broccolini always. Their grilled chicken is good. I also like their mac n cheese and pizzas. I'm not a salad person, but my girlfriends love the Thai crunch. My kids also love the pizza here so it's a win. The service is pretty good. All of the servers are nice and most of the time the food comes quickly. The cocktails are great but pricey. And I've never tried the desserts. Other things to point out... Awesome patio area.

We sat outside which was nice. Our server came out with fresh bread and olive oil. He made some great suggestions on what's good on the menu. My boyfriend went with the chicken Milanese and I had the chicken piccata. Both plates were delicious! They also recommend wine that pairs well with each dish and we ordered that as well. They were both chilled white wine. Delicious. I wish I could remember the name of them. They paired really well with our dishes. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the presentation was super cute! We enjoyed our dinner here and enjoyed the food and drinks. Our server was attentive and kind.

Lenny K.,"Edison, NJ",252,682,369,3.0,8/28/2016,"Pleasant server.  So-so Cobb Salad.  A decent choice if you are already in the mall but definitely not as a destination even for a casual lunch.  I ordered blue cheese dressing for my salad and although the dressing had chunks of blue cheese in it, it tasted like ranch dressing.   I should note that the front of the house staff was very helpful and accommodating too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boca-raton

Marissa R.,"Delray Beach, FL",3,67,,1.0,1/15/2017,"We were here for a family birthday.  After being seated promptly, the waiter came to take our drink order.  He then brought the drinks and left a few straws on the table, but not enough for all of our drinks.  We finally got his attention and he came over and stated that he had 'counted the number of straws he needed'.  Huh??  You don't have extras in your apron?  What waiter does not carry straws - or even worse counts them??!!  He brought some extras over after that.   Next we ordered appetizers. I had the Sahara desert - oops, I mean the Italian chopped.  It was drier than the Sahara desert!  I could have picked some greens and thrown them on my plate and it would have tasted the same.  The general consensus of everyone was that the appetizers were just okay.   For my main course, I ordered the Margarita pizza.  Although it clearly states on the menu (as does every single restaurant I have ordered this from) that it comes with Italian tomatoes, there was not a single tomato on the pizza.  I asked the waiter where the tomatoes were and he said they're in the sauce!  For real??  Noooo!  A Margarita pizza means there are tomatoes ON TOP. The others in our party who ordered pizza all said the same thing; they were just okay, nothing special and on top of that they tasted as if they were premade and reheated.  Hard crusts on the top and they looked very dried up.   This was my third and final time dining in CPK.  There is nothing redeeming about it.  The service was so-so, food was subpar and overall not worth returning for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boca-raton
Lauren C.,"Brooklyn, NY",167,64,238,4.0,7/10/2016,"CPK is always a crowd pleaser, and never disappoints. However, their food is nothing to write home about. My friends and I go here often because of its universal appeal--literally anyone can eat here and be happy with the menu. I love the Waldorf Salad and jalapeño fettuccini Alfredo. The thai crunch salad is also amazing (the best version of that type of salad in my opinion), and the soup is surprisingly tasty. They also do side by side soups and if you're an indecisive nerd like me then you will find that pretty cool.  Contrary to their name, I don't think their pizzas are anything too special. I'll order the pizza occasionally because I like the personal sized portion, but I've definitely had better pizza. I don't think they get enough credit for their drinks. I've had great sangria , margaritas, and Moscow mules there as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boca-raton

Juan E.,"Boca Raton, FL",75,23,8,1.0,7/16/2017,"I've been in some other CPK but this one wasn't good.  My steak pizza came incomplete some of the slices didn't have any meat.  They made a mistake with my daughter's order and gave her a pizza with no pepperoni then they ""fixed"" the order so instead of making a new pizza they simply put pepperoni on top, so all the pepperoni were stuck together and were not cut with the slices. We couldn't find our waitress because she was taking care of people not only inside but also outside the restaurant.  I hope the fix those problems but it seems that management can fix that.  I don't know if I am going back again there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boca-raton
Rachel M.,"Boynton Beach, FL",727,683,293,5.0,10/15/2013,"Stopped in for a celebratory group lunch with some colleagues. My friend and I arrived a bit later than the rest of the party and was happy to see that the waitress could accomodate our beverage orders quickly.  Pressed for time I skipped the appetizers and went straight for the carnitas pizza on a thin crust.  When the food for the rest of the table was brought out, I realized my pizza was prepared on a regular crust. Having noticed the error, our waitress offered to remake the pizza. As we were waiting (no more than 5 mins later) the manager brings over the white corn appetizer as a courtesy.  It was delicious! Nice chunks of avocado mixed into white corn and jicama.  My pizza arrived within minutes and was absolutely delicious. The flavors were better than expected and was very filling.  When our check was brought out, the manager had comped both the appetizer and the pizza for the delay in delivery and mix-up.

The chile relleno consist of spicy poblano that is stuffed with chicken, cheese, roasted corn, black bean salsa, wild mushrooms, spinach and eggplant. I have also had the Pesto Cream Penne and it was delicious as well.   Recently I came here for lunch. Service was very fast and our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  I decided to give the lunch duo a try. My pick was the 7"" pepperoni pizza with the  sedona tortilla soup. Our orders were ready super quick. This duo definitely fills you up.

Smith J.,"Orlando, FL",327,180,126,5.0,9/3/2015,"Dining experiences come down to one solid single thing in my opinion and that would be SERVICE. It wouldn't be likely that I would say CPK has the best pizza in all the land but it's great, the bread is great, the guacamole is good and they even have VEGETARIAN and even VEGAN  options which are a big plus for those of us that don't partake in eating meat or dairy. I've been to this location three times and each time I've gotten good service but one server stuck out in particular, she went by the name of CHELSEA and greeted my girlfriend  and I with a smile and prompt descriptions of the food choices, specials, personal favorites and INGREDIENTS... I could get served a rock and a shoe and would be more understanding of that than getting bad service when I'm a paying customer. Great service is key to a successful restaurant, you can check my other reviews if you think that's anything short of my bar of tankards.

Jonathan W.,"Coconut Creek, FL",0,1,2,1.0,6/24/2016,Went to California pizza kitchen for the third time and had an awful initial experience. I was with my girlfriend so there was only two of us to seat. The hostess initially said 5-10 min. We sat there for the next 20 mins watching three tables that came after us get seated before us. I do not know what happened but we felt like they seated the larger tables first so they could make more money. We almost took our service elsewhere but I know how good the food is so we stayed.

Brad S.,"Coral Springs, FL",50,138,104,4.0,12/21/2013,"Never been to one, as wasn't sure of the concept. California pizza? Do I make my own? And not real big on chains either. But I was always curious, and having been Xmas shopping all afternoon, and not really desiring mall court food, we went with the convenience of having the CPK right at the end of the mall we finished at. Fate brought me to try this place. I really liked the interior, the lights were not bright nor was it dark and we were seated right away. They have flat screens and a view of the kitchen.  So first glance of the menu and I see you don't stick the pizza in yourself. Hmm ok, lets try the Moroccan spiced chicken and white-corn guac and chips. I should have realized right away the ""California"" means ""Avocado-in-everything"". We ordered the ""California Club"" pizza. Hey we're at CPK, may as well live out the experience the whole way through! And sure enough, our pizza looked like a salad complete with avocados on top. I'm not complaining, I grew up with them and love them. But my wife doesn't at all, and my kid... forget about it. So I wound up eating mostly all of them, but next time will be holding back on ordering the guac. I was going to give a 3-and-a-half-star, but little things bumped it up. The peach iced tea was great, the bread came with a dipping sauce and was attentive and we just enjoyed the evening after being tired of walking round the mall, so it bumped it up to a 4-star. Would I come again? Sure, but be mindful of all the items with avocado, i'm surprised they haven't come up with a avocado desert! hmmmmm",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boca-raton?start=40

We usually eat at the restaurant  Tonight we ordered a to-go order, for the first time, for a family of 4. Two pizzas- Spinach and Artichoke and BBQ Chicken Pizza, and two cups of Tortilla Soup. And a side Caesar salad. We ordered online and we're told to pick up at 7:10.  When we got there we had to wait for our order because they said the pizza is still in the oven. They brought us our food and good thang we looked because our soup wasn't in there.  We live less than 2 miles from CPK. By the time we got home our pizza was cold. I could understand it being warm but it was literally cold.  The soups were almost laughable. They were hot but were filled up MAYBE a 1/4 of the container. If that's their cup size, that is a very expensive cup at $4.25.  I would advise for a to-go/online order you make sure to really check your order before leaving the restaurant. We ended up having to heat up the pizza when we got home.  We did call to let the manager know and their customer service definitely is superior to other places.

Fedo F.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,3,,1.0,3/10/2015,"I had to write this review for all the CPK take-out lovers like my self. One star is overrated for the repeated experiences my family has been having with this company. We fell in love with CPK while in Culver City CA and had great experiences as we did later at the Palm Beach Garden FL location: great staff, great food, great service. When we moved to Boca Raton it all went downhill. Pretty much every take-out we get is missing items or we receive smaller portions then we ordered. We had contacted the location from the very first time it happened and the resolution we were offered was for us to drive right back and pick up the missing item (about a 30 min drive for us...while CPK does offer delivery for some extra cash it seams an error on their part is not worth management those extra bucks to get it delivered....not even when repeatedly commiting the same mistake over and over and over again drawing shoulders and blaming it on management). For those unfamiliar with the reasoning: not providing a service or product that has been payed for is simple: theft! Last attempt was at the Wellington FL location where we were given again an item short and a salad filled with rotten black avocados...the math of which skips me: gourmet prices for low end fast-food services and products.  But it does not end here: my husband finally got trough to management (national) and presented his complaint. with heartfelt apologies for the money and trouble we were offered a gift card that was supposed to arrive sometime...since november?! last year! the next deplorable experience we had we tried to contact them again and were once again offered heartfelt apologies for both the crappy service and for not receiving our compensation and were told we were going to receive our gift card. It is march now...still nothing. Fact is, I would not eat from KPC if they had Buddha him self on the staff. It is not a decision we took on an impulse but after multiple sessions of ""rape"" and disrespect for a regular paying customer. It almost feels like they are being cheap asses trying to save a buck on our behalf...which should never be the philosophy of a company with their pricing. I actually took the energy to contact consumer protection services and, believe it or not, i hate complaining as  i hate spending time on the web writing long reviews like this one. I do no longer even trust the quality or sanitary conditions they have as such loose treatment of customer orders and complaints denote negligence and carelessness and, well, you know ""the way we do anything is the way we do everything"" hope this is helpful",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boca-raton?start=40

I've also had the garlic and cheese pizza. The last time I had it though I thought it didn't have as much garlic taste as I remembered so I was a little disappointed. The flavored teas are tasty and appetizer wise the spinach artichoke dip and the dumplings are definite winners. The fried Mac and cheese from the starter menu however is a bust.

SOOOO GOOD!!!   But, if you are craving some pizza... well, you will have a long list to choose from.  Unfortunately they lost a star because they took my favorite pizza off the menu:  The Greek!  GONE... bye bye... never to be heard from again.  But, they still have one of the best, the pear and Gorgonzola pizza.  Get it on honey whole wheat, totally worth it.  Slices of pear on the pizza, with hazelnuts and topped with a salad of arugula and Parmesan.  Very very good.  The Thai and the carnitas is really good too.       I've never had anything else there besides soup, salad, pizza and dessert.  The peach tea is pretty decent too!  Overall, its a decent place to grab some food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boca-raton?start=60

I'm a traditionalist when it comes to pizza, and just want it with cheese and sauce.  I would've gotten the regular one on the honey wheat crust, but I decided to try the neapolitan pizza, which is a thin crust pizza and came with a pomodoro sauce with smoked gouda, fontina, and mozzarella.  You could definitely taste the gouda, which gave it a different flavor.  It was really good, but quite big (I only managed to eat half of it).  The boyfriend got the hawaiian and had all except one slice of his. We came around 8:30 on a Wednesday night, so seating was hardly an issue.  Our waiter was attentive, and service was quick, so overall it was a good experience :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boca-raton?start=60

Chris, the manager, came over to greet us shortly after Emily left the table. He wanted to welcome us back and thank us for coming in. He mentioned that CPK was reinventing their menu selection and their look and that Boca was one of the first to do so. He recommended the halibut and the ribeye steak since they were new items. Our server was Jaquez, who was such a polite server. We loved the halibut, the butter cake, the service, the ambiance and the welcoming staff who made sure we loved our experience.

The Tequila pasta...oh, mouth watering good. Seating service was a bit slow - but I guess that's always going to be the case when arriving during the lunch hour traffic.

Paulina F.,"Delray Beach, FL",34,45,92,5.0,12/12/2016,"CPK gets 5 stars because every time I come here I am happy with the food and service. They also have awesome Kids Menus. You can make reservations and call do ahead seating as well. It's located in Town Center Mall by Saks Fifth Avenue. CPK works well with big parties. I have tried many entrees on their Menu including the Kids Menu and love all of them. From their pizzas and pastas to their salads and appetizers everything has great flavor. They also give you bread with a seasoned olive oil dipping sauce. Sometimes they forget to bring it out, so you have to ask for it. My favorite dish on the Kids Menu is the Mac and Cheese with edamame. You can choose whether you want the edamame or not (it's a small extra charge). The dish is pretty big and sometimes I can't even finish it. My favorite salad is the Asian Thai Crunch with Chicken. It has crunchy rice noodles, peanuts, and the dressing has a little kick to it, but nothing crazy. My favorite pasta is the Mushroom pasta. It is filled with flavor and if you love mushrooms, try this out. I've tried most of the pizzas and all of them were delicious. I love the thin crust. CPKs portions are pretty big. It  may look small in the dish, but it is more than enough! Sometimes when I come here with my family, we'll order a pizza and 2 or 3 entrees to share.  The service here is awesome. Every waiter I've had always came to the table several times throughout my meal to refill water or to ask if we needed anything. The wait is never long either and it's great that it is in the mall because you can go walk around and shop, which makes time go by faster! CPK is a relaxed environment, no need to dress up, but you can if you want.

From being seated, to waiting on our server to acknowledge us, to placing our order (which of course, came out completely wrong and ill-timed), the entire experience was a clear reflection of a place putting college kids to work who 1) don't care 2) have never been formally trained by management. All of this being said, there didn't appear to be a manager who seemed to care about her job. I called her over, we had a very nice discussion, and she expressed her frustration as well. On my way out, I noticed another gentleman asking for the manager who was also visibly frustrated.
