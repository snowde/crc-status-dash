Steven P.,"Brookline, MA",159,36,1,3.0,10/12/2017,"Ambience: Located in the Prudential Shopping Mall, it is a decent spot to dine and shop. I like the modern look and basic bar setting. There isn't much flashiness to the whole restaurant, but it is clean and comfortable, which counts for something. Service: Our waiter was nice and the service was pretty quick between taking our orders and delivering on said orders.  Food: My table ordered the buffalo cauliflowers, spring rolls of different varieties and I personal got a large cobb salad. The buffalo cauliflower was delicious, mostly due to the tangy sauce. I felt the spring rolls were decent, however I wouldn't order them again. Lastly, the cobb salad was huge, fresh and tasty. I like the large portion of avocado and chicken.  Overall Rating: Overall this place earns 3 out of 5 stars. I was not blown away by this place, but did enjoy my meal. I think the atmosphere was overall average, service again average and food pretty good. I would recommend to try this place since it's relatively affordable and provides quite the variety.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston-2
Araxie Y.,"Cambridge, MA",39,167,9,1.0,9/24/2017,"Where do I begin?  We were set to come in here after the Jimmy Fund Walk, we had a party of 11 and Rafael was nice enough to accommodate everything for our party as we arrived. We sat and our troubles began when we were introduced to Charolette.  First off, it's quite clear she lacked the personality and work ethic to even be in on a Sunday afternoon. She seemed incredibly slow and confused the entire time she took simple drink orders. The drinks arrived late and unorganized, some missing ingredients even! The food arrived with the drinks, we sat around as they did nothing and continued to talk amongst themselves. I get it, it's a Sunday, you don't wanna be here, but really? The food was even horrible quality, the halibut was undercooked, the foods with dairy allergies had dairy! Charlotte seemed incredibly uninterested and even to protect herself brought out the slip to show proof she requested it the correct way. What good does that do for me? The waitress or waiter is supposed to let the kitchen know it's wrong and immediately solve it. Not sit in front of the person and say oh I'm sorry, want something else?  We waited forever to simply eat and enjoy after a long committed walk. The general vibe of this place was just lazy and their employees clearly not invested in a job at all. Several people need employment, why stay where you're miserable? You're only making the experience awful for the proprietors.  My suggestion is regardless of the day of the week, hire servers who look and act like they're alive; not dreary, undetermined or disconnected from reality. Charlotte was just insufferable, half asleep and not even empathetic. She just was a mumbling girl that attempted to serve us food that sadly was not edible. Suffice it to say, we left happily and most certainly won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston-2
Mitul M.,"New York, NY",30,56,3,2.0,8/13/2017,"I have been to many different CPK restaurants and this one is by far the worst service I have had. I went on a Friday at 2pm and it wasn't busy. I was seated right away. After 20 minutes no one had approached us and we didn't even know who our waiter was. So I flagged down another server and asked if we could have a waiter and they said sure. 10 minutes later another waiter came and asked for our drinks, she ran away while I was ordering and so apparently didn't hear about my appetizer order.  10 minutes later we got our drinks from someone else and we told her we were ready to order food. A few minutes later our waiter came back and we ordered. I ordered the appetizer again (flatbread) with my pizza and told her to just bring things out as soon as they were ready because at this point we were there for 45+ minutes for lunch.  The pizza came in a reasonable amount of time after that but no one refilled our drinks (water or soda). One of my friends got the fish tacos and stopped eating after a few bites because he became nauseated. My pizza was overcooked (burned) but edible. Certainly not as good as the other 5-6 CPK locations I had been to previously.  My appetizer never came.  Basically I'm never coming here again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston-2
Kim M.,"Boston, MA",290,265,635,4.0,7/30/2017,"Rounding up from a 3.5/5. I had a $50 gift card to CPK burning in my pocket for well over a year so I figured why not head over and claim my free lunch? The Boy and I started our meal with Baja Chicken Tortilla Rolls. These were just meh. Really would serve the dish well if it was served with salsa or sour cream instead of just guacamole. We also shared an order of Szechwan Chicken Dumplings. These were tasty as all hell for dumplings; however, wouldn't call them szechuan, they're not spicy at all. Also they were stingy with the delicious sauce. As aghast as the Boy was (and subsequently my sister later when I told my sister about this meal), I ordered the Kung Pao Spaghetti. with Shrimp Similar to the dumplings, this dish was tasty - nowhere near authentic and also lacking in spice even though there are red hot chiles in this dish. Overall, the meal was decent and we didn't have any issues with service as stated with other reviews. Tasty for sure but don't go in expecting a meal equivalent of a 4-star steakhouse.

Ben T.,"Glen Iris, Australia",0,1,,1.0,1/4/2018,Worst bar service I've ever received in 5 years of visiting the US and 4th visit to Boston.

Prateek S.,"Boston, MA",99,168,650,3.0,6/15/2017,"Ever seen a bunch of first-time offenders spearing garbage on the highway?  They have humiliation dripping from their foreheads and a puss on them like a dead cat.  They won't make eye contact and they don't so much spear as stab.  A lot of them struggle with even this concept. Their second round of community service was, without a doubt, to be servers at the California Pizza Kitchen in Prudential Center. When I asked for a table for four, I awoke the hostess from a deep slumber.  Annoyed at being startled out of her sleep, she grabbed four menus like they had murdered her parents and walked to the table quietly and fast.  She was gone in a wisp of smoke before we even sat down.  She said nothing in reply to our thank yous. We were early and the other couple we were meeting was still twenty minutes away.  It took fifteen minutes for a server who looked like he had smoked every ounce of ganja in the Caribbean to amble over.  We placed drink orders and I really wanted to place a food order in case he wandered out and forgot where he worked but our friends were still parking. As I watched him walk away, I felt like you do when you run up to the check-in counter at the airport and see the ""GATE CLOSED"" sign in red on the monitor. It took almost another ten minutes after our friends arrived for this dude to come back.  We finally got to place our food orders.  Judging by the items available on the menu, CPK is to pizza what Olive Garden is to pasta.  Hooded in the cloak of Italian cuisine, both restaurants boast one type of dish as their pride and joy and, a little less proudly, also offer other common Italian fare. I got two toppings on each half of my pizza: Roasted garlic chicken on one half and mushroom pepperoni sausage on the other.  I also had a bite of the carne asada. I'd like to say something about steak on pizzas . . .  I love 'Everybody Loves Raymond.'  It's pure genius.  When Brad Garrett's character finally gets married and is taking his vows, the mom stands up to make a comment, to everyone's shock and no one's surprise.  That's what steak is like on a pizza.  Like Marie Barone, steak is a force to be reckoned with and a full meal on its own terms.  A pizza already has cheese, vegetables, and a crust.  It's Robert's wedding and it doesn't need steak to make it better.   All steak does is trample all over the wedding ceremony.  Avoid the carne asada. Get the mushroom pepperoni sausage instead.  The chunks of sausage are huge, three times bigger than the fingernail-sized pieces you find on most pizzas, and the pepperoni is pure fatty, crisp yet chewy tonguegasm.  I don't even remember if there was cheese.  I don't think it needs cheese.  The meat is enough. The roasted garlic chicken was like the ugly friend of a hot person.  Next to the pepperoni, it was a 4 at best.  Want to guess what the problem was?  You got it: Not enough salt.  I would suggest generously salting the onions while you caramelize them.  Salt releases the natural juices of the onions and makes them even more flavorful.  Then, it combines with the juices to build the flavor of the onions to the very best it can be. That's all the salt the roasted garlic chicken needs.  The mozzarella was okay and the chicken just about got away with having no seasoning so this dish could be improved just by salting the onions.  But it could be even better if CPK got a really good char on the chicken.  Salt and char will ALWAYS make your food taste better. And don't talk to me about the ""link"" between the substances in charred meat and cancer.  There is always a study that shows a ""link"" and people think it's a hard-and-fast rule.  If I tried hard enough, I could show you a correlation between the thickness of nose hair and the size of your balls. Enough paranoia.  Live, love, fuck, char. While we're on this subject, ignore CPK's calorie information next to their menu items.  If you're eating at CPK, chances are you're not on a diet prescribed by Dr. Nowzaradan.  Just order anything with pepperoni or sausage on it, avoid everything else, and remember to pencil ""stair master"" into your to-do list for the next day. Done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston-2

My fiance and I decided to eat here right before we drove back home from Boston.  They have GF pizza, which is awesome.  I have enjoyed CPK many times in the past, but had not been back in several years. Long story short - I ordered a gf pizza and my fiance ordered a salad.  That's it, nothing else.  From the time we arrived, until the time we left, 2 hours had elapsed!!  Seriously!  Partly they messed up my GF pizza, so they had to re-do it, and partly, they are just damn slow.   Our server was running around taking orders and delivering food to tables.  It was just too much.  So he would disappear for long stretches.

The place was not even full, I don't know what she was busy with. She came back, while I told her about the fork, my husband realized she got us dirty plates . Really??? He was quick in letting her know, coz God knows when she will be back. She came back with cutleries and plates. At that time she bothered to ask us, do u want th complimentary bread??? We were so busy digging inc we just nodded as we were not sure. Then came our pizza, the main course, but the complimentary bread appetizers were no where in the picture.

Beans, tomatoes, peppers, onions, and the sauce, it's as if instead of putting those things in a burrito, you just placed them on top of a pizza pie crust. If I'm in a group I always get it as one of the pizzas, since you can still try the other ones that others in the group want to try. The other two that we got were the California Club Pizza and the Thai Chicken Pizza. The Club is like a salad on a pizza; loved the big slices of avocado that were placed on top.

I ordered for my friend who was running late and myself then my cousins ordered their meals.  Our food came and it was delicious of course! I did want a refill on my water but it took her a while to come and see if... A. How our food was.. B. Can she get us anythign else.. When my friend finally arrived, our waitress did not even come to ask her if she wanted a drink or anything. Oh wait, she did after she finished her meal and was very quick to ask if we wanted dessert.  The last thing that irritated me about this experience was that when I first ordered my meal, I said I wanted to Avocado instead of the CHICKEN on my pizza since I am a vegeterian and I verified that it was STILL an equal exchange and she said YES to me. Well she charged me an additional $5.00 for avocado but when I pointed this mistake out to her she got defensive and questioned me.

I used to go to the one downtown where the food was always great and the service was as well, but once that got shut down I began going to the one at the Prudential center. BIG MISTAKE! I have gone to this location twice and the service has been constantly terrible.  One my first visit we were not greeted for over 10 minutes by a server and we then had to track down the hostess to a get a server where she told us that she was unaware of who our server was and walked away. we then tracked down the manager who got just grabbed someone and told them that they were our server. The entire time he served us he kept asking that we nit write a bad review and when we left the manager asked us to write a nice review. I found that to be very unprofessional and uncomfortable.However my worst experience was one my 2nd and last time at this location. I was planning to celebrate my boyfriends birthday there with some friend. I called first and asked if I could bring a cake in and then come back because it was a surprise. When I delivered the cake the host seemed very annoyed that she had to walk the 2 feet to put t in the freezer and the guy doing take out window seemed even more peeved to put it in the freezer. On that note I asked for it to stay out as it had to defrost and that I would be back with my party in a hour. When we returned to eat I noticed the cake was not out so I once again asked the hostess to make sure that the cake was taken out so it could defrost and if she could ask our server to bring it at the end of the meal. After waiting 15 minutes for our server who was exceptionally slow and also seemed to be annoyed when we asked for water with lemon (she blatantly rolled her eyes)we ordered. Towards the end of the meal I was already a bit annoyed by the service, she was slow, and never refilled our glasses. I asked her if she could bring out the cake ad she said that she assumed I and the hostess would bring it out although I specifically gave it to the restaurant so my server could bring it, I went back to the hostess stand to ask about the cake. Although it had only been 1 hour she seemed to not remember me nor the cake and told me that she didnt know if it was taken out and that I should ask the guy at take out. When I went over to ask him he also seemed confused and told me he forgot to take it out. At that point I was so annoyed I went and spoke with the manager who was less than helpful as he just told me to sit and wait.After waiting ANOTHER 10 minutes I asked for the check and to just take my still frozen cake home with me, It was the worst CPK experience I have ever had and I will never go back, nor will the people in my party.

Once I finished, the only taste left in my mouth was that of dough and salt. I also believe that this pizza used to come with truffle oil, which contributed to the deliciousness. This is now an optional item (extra $$). I usually get it with chicken (extra $$) and even the texture of the little chicken that was on there was different. the pieces were completely cold too. I really hope that these changes are limited to this location only and were not a change as part of a corporate initiative to reduce cost/increase profit margins on their pizzas.

Amanda was super helpful in mentioning that they can do half-and-half pizzas, for those who want to share two different kinds of toppings, or if you want to try two for yourself. So there we were, happily eating our pizzas, when the house lights suddenly and inexplicably got much brighter.  This was not a temporary failure but something that seemed designed to make people leave.

It wasn't bad but it's not something I'd order again unless there was an option to change the cheese. Then I tried the Garlic Cream pasta with chicken the first time and it was pretty good. Then I got it again and it was not as cheesy as before so it can be a hit and miss unfortunately,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston-2?start=80

The pastas here aren't anything special. They aren't the best either, mostly on the bland or oily side. The guacamole here is pretty good though. However, for the price you pay, you only get about a mouthful. It was probably 2x the size of the small ketchup cups you get at a fast food restaurant. Not worth it. The fried mac and cheese balls were alright. Nothing great either. The service was decent. Not superb but alright.

Hurnan V.,"Riverside, CA",519,253,215,4.0,3/12/2014,"CPK is always a great way to fill up after a day at the mall, post work, post classes etc. Spacious seating areas inside, CPK accommodates any size parties. As they specialize in their pizza, your orders are also out in a very timely manner. In the past, I have ordered and stuck with the California Club, which is essentially greens/avocado on top of a pizza topped with chicken and bacon. This pizza never disappoints and satisfies both my salad and pizza fixes. :) The staff is always super friendly as well. Also, you can ask for bread and butter/oil after you are seated! (You can also get free re-fills of bread.)

I'm a fan of their Thai salad, especially with avocado, but this time I decided to try something different. I got the wedge salad appetizer, and the pesto cream penne. They were okay. The wedge salad was very plain, like a Cobb salad in wedge form, but the blue cheese dressing was unimpressive. Not bad, just not particularly good. The pesto cream penne with chicken was more flavorful and creamy, but nothing to write home about. The flavors were simply dull. I might go back on occasion, if other places have a wait, but I wouldn't really recommend this place.

However, didn't know where to go on the weekend and stepped in here.  Glad to say I was very relieved that this is a NORMAL CPK, with none of the shadiness attached.  The chicken tequila fettucini actually has chicken inside and the pizza actually had toppings on it! haha.   Not asking for much, really.

In terms of catered lunch prep, they do a great job. When I order online, they show an estimated completion time which they usually meet. However, the food itself is mediocre. The pizzas are $10-15, but are really personal sized. You could get a much better pizza from Upper Crust or Figs for about $20 that feeds 2-3 people. The Habanero Carnitas and Jamaican Jerk pizzas are good, but the others are mediocre at best (I've actually tried them all). The field greens salad is tasty, but this is a pizza restaurant and I hope for better. If you must eat pizza in Back Bay, try Pizzeria Regina.

Another plus was the unlimited refill on the strawberry lemonade which was delicious, but very sweet. Our server was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was casual.  The appetizer we got was focaccia bread with oil for $3 which wasn't bad. We spent $30 on a lunch in Boston for 2 people, that's not too bad in my opinion.

CPK is right on par with the rest of the chain restaurant fare at the Pru (Legal, PF Chang's, Cheesecake Factory), so it's certainly not a bad decision to stop in if you're looking for a meal after you're done shopping.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston-2?start=80

The Shrimp Scampi had little baby shrimp which were yummy. We also had a Greek, Jamaican Jerk, and another Tostado and everyone was happy! We were worried we might not have enough pizza for 8 people and planned to order more but 5 was plenty. It made it really affordable but there were no leftovers.

I ordered a piece of cheesecake and a spinach artichoke pizza with honey wheat crust.  I waited for about 20 minutes and swatted at some fruit flies while I waited.  Side note observation:  their ""bar"" is pitiful.  About 15 bottles of bottom shelf liquor.  I'm not sure how many different drinks that can make, but when they're lined up on the ledge above the pizza prep table, I'm not impressed.  Liquor deserves special treatment. My pizza and cheesecake finally arrived, and so did my bill.  No discount.  So I had to wave down the manager, who made a slight deal about it, until he corrected my tab.   When I got home, the pizza wasn't on the honey whole wheat crust, but whatever.  I had a couple pieces and then went to take a few bites of the cheesecake.  Brrr.  The cheesecake was still frozen.  Not only did it survive transit on top of the pizza as I brought it home, but it sat in the apartment for approximately 20 more minutes as I ate my pizza.  Still frozen?  Pitiful.  I'll get my CPK from my local Shaw's from now on, thanks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston-2?start=100

Allison R.,"Somerville, MA",239,689,173,2.0,3/13/2009,"Review #200, here goes... I was reclining on the couch last night with a hookah and some television (typical night at The Home), lamenting that I was standing at the precipice of a milestone: Yelp Review 200. I had started and stopped a couple reviews that I felt were not worthy, but the truth is, I simply was not inspired. My roommate said he ought to sit down someday and read my reviews, and asked if I had Yelped the CPK that touched my avocado. Gasp! I had not...until now.  It was a crisp spring night, and we had tried to go to multiple Cheesecake Factory locations with no luck-- every restaurant required at least a 45 minute wait, and we were huuung-ry. The solution turned out to be this California Pizza Kitchen, where we were able to be seated at the bar immediately.  Our waitress/bartender seemed moderately ticked that we ordered just a water and a coke, and nothing from the bar. She kind of disdainfully poured our drinks and plopped them down in front of us. We ordered, and whatever pizza I chose was topped with slivers of avocado-- probably the defining reason I chose it. I saw our food come out of the kitchen (I was starving and watching for our food like a hawk), and noticed the pizza lacked avocado. The waitress then proceeded to reach her-- gloveless (!)-- hand into a plastic cube and place the coveted green goodness on top of the pizza...with said ungloved hand! One dropped on the cutting board below, and she made sure not to waste it and added it to my pizza. Gross. I ate the pizza anyway, but when we got glared at for ordering refills on our drinks, that sealed the deal on the service.  The bill arrived and we left a meager tip (under 50 cents, if memory serves) along with a note: ""Be nice and you'll get better tips. :( PS- We saw the avocado."" Sure, it was mean and vindictive, but oh so true. Looking like you don't want to serve your customers makes them feel like tipping you is optional.

Wanting something inside the mall (it was POURING) and with quick service, we stopped here and found out it was a 10 minute wait. Pretty good for a Friday night! We got sat really fast and our waiter was awesome - patient, funny, helpful. We ended up sharing the The Original BBQ Chicken Chopped (Chopped lettuce, black beans, sweet corn, jicama, cilantro, basil, crispy corn tortilla strips and Monterey Jack cheese tossed together in herb ranch dressing - we got the balsamic and the ranch on the side. Topped with chopped BBQ chicken breast, diced tomatoes and green onions) and the Chinese Chicken Salad (Shredded Napa cabbage, crisp iceberg and crispy wontons tossed with julienne carrots, red cabbage, green onions, toasted sesame seeds and fresh cilantro in a spicy sweet & sour sesame dressing. Topped with chilled-grilled chicken breast). We liked the BBQ better, but both were great. For our main course, we shared the Roasted Garlic Chicken pizza (Roasted garlic, grilled chicken, Mozzarella cheese, mild onions and Italian parsley with a white wine and garlic-shallot butter sauce) which was quite tasty, but was not as good as the Thin Crust Pepperoni Supremo (Italian Pomodoro sauce with pepperoni, Mozzarella, Parmesan and fresh Mozzarella cheeses. Topped with fresh herbs). This was by far the favorite of the table! We didn't get any bread, but we didn't need it. For 4 people, this was a great meal and we were pretty full after!

Julie T.,"Boston, MA",145,262,35,2.0,11/13/2008,"One of my all time not favorite chains. The food here is mediocre when compared to other chain restaurants and I'm not the only one who thinks so. CPK makes the Cheesecake Factory look amazing, in my opinion. CPK serves up the same kind of food, but lacking in quantity and quality. When I eat at Cheesecake Factory, I can get a dish with no starches (a salad, a soup) and leave incredibly full and sometimes, with leftovers! I've ordered burgers and pizzas at CPK and left hungry after eating everything on my plate. Now, their food isn't HORRIBLE, but I'd say in comparison to other chains, they're beat in more ways than one.  Example: Thai Lettuce Wraps: one of my favorite appetizers to order as an entree. Cheesecake? One of those and I can barely inhale. CPK? I need to order an app to eat before my entree comes out. Maybe you're thinking that my stomach was in a different condition on each of those days. You're right, it was. I was hungrier when I went to Cheesecake, but left more satisfied with more money in my pocket. So what do you think of that? Anyways, it's just in my opinion that CPK loses to nearly all chains.

We were seated quickly and that's when the fun times ended. The waitress though pleasant, did not have her act together. First it took about 10 minutes for us to get waters. Then it took about 3o minutes for the first of our sandwiches/personal pizzas/soup/salads to arrive and there was at least a 15 minute gap between when the first of us and last of us was served our main meal. Also, she must have thought that the word  ""tortilla""  sounded like ""asparagus"" because instead of the warm bowl of Mexican soup I was expected, I was instead presented with an oddly green steaming concoction. Not usually a big deal, but by this point all I could think of was ""come on already!"". The food itself was not prepared the way we requested it. The kitchen decided that my friend asking for no cheese on her pizza meant that they could still top it with ""queso"" sauce......I ordered the Tuscan Salad off of the small cravings menu and it was gross. The cannelli  beans were mealy and the dressing tasted like straight flavorless oil. 6 dollars for a cup of untastey veggies? never again.  The tortilla soup(when it finally arrived) was flavorless, and reminded me of cardboard. The closest thing I can compare it to would be slightly cheesy cream of wheat. So yeah, I won't be going back to CPK anytime soon.

Hisham K.,"Cambridge, MA",38,104,,4.0,11/12/2008,"I love the pizzas at CPK, and the service is usually very good. This CPK in particular made me laugh until my BBQ chicken pizza nearly came out of my nose. I was sitting at my table with my friend Melis, eating my pizza while she had her soup. Suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I saw something streak across the floor right past our table. At first I thought it was the glint of someone's jewelry reflecting on my glasses, but when I turned around to look at the gray streak of lighting, it actually turned out to be a mouse. Certainly, that is no laughing matter. A mouse in a restaurant? You may as well have a can of Raid at every table sitting next to the salt & pepper! That mouse had jetted across the floor of a VERY crowded restaurant located in a MALL on a FRIDAY NIGHT. And NO ONE saw it. Serious bravado. I caught the attention of a passing waitress. ""I don't mean to cause any alarm or anything,"" I began to say, ""but I just saw something..."" ""Oh,"" she cut me off, ""Was it the mouse?"" I paused for a moment and hissed, ""What do you mean THE mouse??"" That's right. They knew about the mouse. She told me that they're right above the Green line, and sometimes the mouse turns up... but she assured me that it's harmless and that the kitchen is squeaky clean. At first I was incredulous. I could not fathom this. CPK has a pet mouse! Soon after we left, Melis and I just couldn't stop laughing at the whole thing. I have said nearly nothing about CPK itself, although I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this chain (other than this little mascot they have running around). Their pizzas are great, their salads are awesome, and the venue is always clean. And even though I saw a mouse in this restaurant with my own eyes, I still eat there because the food is just so damn good. Yes, my taste buds may need some fine-tuning, but that's just me. Talk about a brand positioning success - even though there's a mouse in the equation, I still prefer CPK over Pizza Hut. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston-2?start=120
Adam Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",276,229,48,1.0,11/25/2008,"Where to begin, well to start off I have been to this location of California Pizza Kitchen four times before. Previously they've been great.  On Monday night (11/25/08) my brother and I decided to grab some dinner here after shopping. The place wasn't packed at all with empty tables everywhere (half the restaurant was empty).  Yet the hostess told us there would be a 20 minutes wait. We asked for a medium or large booth (not a small one).  We asked nicely what the reason for the wait was (due to the very apparent emptiness) she replied that they only had 3 waiters and were understaffed. We said okay and asked her if we had to wait or if we could go browse the shops and come back in 15 minutes). She said ""Yes that's fine but be back in 20 minutes not 15. We found her reply a bit abrasive but ignored it. We came back 20 minutes later and they were packed (every table). Not only that but she said they had a medium booth open but it was just taken and now we would have to wait 30 (more) minutes unless we wanted to take a small both. My brother was rather upset and wanted to leave to go to Cheese Cake Factory but I calmed him down and said let's just take the small booth (I should have trusted his instincts and left). Now to the fun. The small booths at this place, keep in mind my brother and I aren't big guys we're both 5'10"" - 5' 11"" and are average weight for our height. These small booths were made for stick figures. There's no way to be comfortable in them. Add to that the table can barely hold the plates the serve due to the width. Not only that but the small booth they sat us at was right in middle of the high traffic error and at the mid-height wall next to us we the waiters register/station was there. So while we were chatting/eating we'd constantly have a waiter staring at us from the other side of the mid-height wall next to the booth. Now that we have the bad seating of this restaurant out of the way to the good stuff...not... So we get our appetizer and enjoy it (they have decent food in my opinion).Before we can finish our appetizer our waiter brings out our entrees (huge no no when waiting ones table in my opinion). So we're eating our entrees and we're half way done, then the waiter comes to the table and says having desserts guys? My brother replies ""most likely but we're still eating our food"" the waiter replied ""I'll come back in a few"".  We finish our food and the waiter brings us our check. My brother is extremely upset as am I due to the fact that the waiter knew we wanted dessert. So we finally get the waiters attention and ask for the dessert menu. He lives and we start looking over the dessert menu. We know what we're getting and wait for the waiter to come back. As we're waiting from underneath our booth two cockroaches come crawling up the wall. YES that's right cockroaches! I nearly throw up but decided to just up and leave the restaurant. We didn't make a scene my brother waited at the table quietly for the manager. 10 minutes go by and the manager doesn't show. The hostess walks by and says to my brother ""Did you enjoy your meal?"" He pointed at one of the roaches and she took one of our used napkins and killed one of them (the other had gone somewhere else by that time). The manager told my brother in not so many words 'What can we do to make up for this and keep it quiet?' End result being we got our meal free (which didn't make up for anything to me). I felt bad for everyone eating in that restaurant at that time if they knew surely they'd all leave. Now that I think back on it maybe we should have made a scene out of respect for everyone else.  To end this review that was all of the bad. The good was our waiter was very friendly he just seemed inexperienced. Also the food was decent but makes me sick thinking of the roaches.

Antonio Z.,"Lake Jackson, TX",28,305,8,2.0,11/14/2008,"I joined this site just to give this restaurant a bad review. We went in with a coupon for a free app. before we realized it had to be used at a different specific location. Oh well, right? We still got an app. ($5 for a big piece of cheesebread) and we ordered two pizzas because we noticed the people next two us each ordered a pizza. Shrimp Scampi Pizza and Sausage and Peppers Pizza....both on Honey Wheat Bread. Olive Garden has better pizza and a better price and they give you free bread and salad with your meal. Service was slow although the restaurant was dead. Don't go here, just save yourself $20 and go eat down the street somewhere else like a real college kid on a budget. I think people go here to spend more money on purpose, because spending any less for pizza would be too pedestrian or something. First and last time I have a craving for trying CPK.

L H.,"Boston, MA",4,125,,2.0,6/21/2006,"This particular branch restaurant is very conveniently located inside the Copley mall right next to the bridge across Mariott Hotel side. The food is well-controlled and taste about the same as the other branch on Stuart st. between Wang Center and the common.But I find their food taste a bit shallow and very sweet.  What I find awkward is the young diners, who are mainly dressed like they are sitting there dying to be displayed. You will have to see it yourself to find lots of people wearing hats and sunglasses while eating, i.e. Men with tight jeans showing the bulging tummies, girls chatting on the phone till they leave. The next drawback is the waiting service. In general, the food is served extremely slow and it can take 1-1.5 hours to sit and have a quick lunch. I advise that  ordering appetizers definitely slows down the next course.  Personally, we had a bad waitress who did not get us a menu for first 15 min. and the drinks were delivered after another 20 min. And, appetizer was served for another 40 minutes later.  When we were leaving without leaving any tip for her, she confronted us at the door poking my back with the receipt plate. And I had to have a good talk with the manager about the slow service and mostly the rudeness I experienced from that waitress. Whether it was the waitress's negligence or the kitchen forgetting the orders, it was never explained to us and the waitress knew we were not happy, yet still confronting us for not leaving any tip or expediting the service. I stopped going there because of that incident, plus, the menu is barely changed and because the food tastes like take out Chinese cooked with any combination of 5 sauces and 4 different meats.

Buffy H.,"Philadelphia, PA",10,24,7,1.0,4/23/2008,"No. Just, no. When I was visiting my older sister in Boston she took us out to lunch and decided on California Pizza Kitchen. We were seated quickly, and the restaurant was a nice place but the serve was sarcastic and although I suspect he was trying to be funny, failed miserably. We waited quite a bit for our water. Yes, water. And then we ordered some pizza, salad, etc. As I was drinking my water I looked down to see things floating in it. My first thought: Ew, did they wash this glass? Then I saw it. A spider. Floating around. I think it took about five years off my lifespan. My waiter took quite a bit of time to notice my hand in the air, and when I said ""there's a spider in my water"" he answered ""I put it there just for you."" Yeah, okay, his tone was just obnoxious.  I will admit the manager was very kind and apologized, she gave us a free appetizer and a bottle of water. Then the water came back with plates, and there was one plate that my sister was able to wipe off a whole load of gunk with her napkin. Hm...do they wash their dishes there? So we got a new one, and our serve admitted we were not having good luck. The food finally came, and my two sisters were sitting across from each other and sharing a salad. My older sister had just put the first bite into her mouth and started chewing when my little sister was like, ""Look, a hair!"" Sure enough, there was a curly black hair that had come along for the ride. Lovely. I raised my hand once again and waited for the server, whose response was ""you're kidding, right?"" The manager came back and apologized once again, saying nothing like this had ever happened before. Yeah, right. We left, without eating, at least we didn't have to pay for the food. (Although we would have been extremely angry if we had been expected to.) That experience effectively killed our appetites and any chance that I will ever be returning.

Big mistake. I ordered the roasted vegetable salad with chicken, a cpk kobb salad, and a meat cravers pizza. I was told it would be prepared in 20 minutes. When I returned in 20 minutes the woman (who was not at the take out window every-time I showed up) told me she was just waiting for the vegetables for the salad.  Another 25 minutes went by until I got my food. 45 minutes later, after ordering, I got a wonderful cobb salad (the only redeemer) , a very cold undercooked pizza, and a roasted vegetable salad that had 4 stips, roughly a quarter of a chicken breast, which was also cold.  So I totally get the up charge at restaurants, BUT that $4 chicken add on could have bought 5 chicken breasts at a grocery store.

Food: My table ordered the buffalo cauliflowers, spring rolls of different varieties and I personal got a large cobb salad. The buffalo cauliflower was delicious, mostly due to the tangy sauce.

We were set to come in here after the Jimmy Fund Walk, we had a party of 11 and Rafael was nice enough to accommodate everything for our party as we arrived. We sat and our troubles began when we were introduced to Charolette.  First off, it's quite clear she lacked the personality and work ethic to even be in on a Sunday afternoon. She seemed incredibly slow and confused the entire time she took simple drink orders. The drinks arrived late and unorganized, some missing ingredients even! The food arrived with the drinks, we sat around as they did nothing and continued to talk amongst themselves. I get it, it's a Sunday, you don't wanna be here, but really? The food was even horrible quality, the halibut was undercooked, the foods with dairy allergies had dairy! Charlotte seemed incredibly uninterested and even to protect herself brought out the slip to show proof she requested it the correct way. What good does that do for me? The waitress or waiter is supposed to let the kitchen know it's wrong and immediately solve it. Not sit in front of the person and say oh I'm sorry, want something else?  We waited forever to simply eat and enjoy after a long committed walk. The general vibe of this place was just lazy and their employees clearly not invested in a job at all. Several people need employment, why stay where you're miserable? You're only making the experience awful for the proprietors.  My suggestion is regardless of the day of the week, hire servers who look and act like they're alive; not dreary, undetermined or disconnected from reality.

A few minutes later our waiter came back and we ordered. I ordered the appetizer again (flatbread) with my pizza and told her to just bring things out as soon as they were ready because at this point we were there for 45+ minutes for lunch.  The pizza came in a reasonable amount of time after that but no one refilled our drinks (water or soda). One of my friends got the fish tacos and stopped eating after a few bites because he became nauseated. My pizza was overcooked (burned) but edible.

Prateek S.,"Boston, United States",99,168,650,3.0,15/6/2017,"Ever seen a bunch of first-time offenders spearing garbage on the highway?  They have humiliation dripping from their foreheads and a puss on them like a dead cat.  They won't make eye contact and they don't so much spear as stab.  A lot of them struggle with even this concept. Their second round of community service was, without a doubt, to be servers at the California Pizza Kitchen in Prudential Center. When I asked for a table for four, I awoke the hostess from a deep slumber.  Annoyed at being startled out of her sleep, she grabbed four menus like they had murdered her parents and walked to the table quietly and fast.  She was gone in a wisp of smoke before we even sat down.  She said nothing in reply to our thank yous. We were early and the other couple we were meeting was still twenty minutes away.  It took fifteen minutes for a server who looked like he had smoked every ounce of ganja in the Caribbean to amble over.  We placed drink orders and I really wanted to place a food order in case he wandered out and forgot where he worked but our friends were still parking. As I watched him walk away, I felt like you do when you run up to the check-in counter at the airport and see the ""GATE CLOSED"" sign in red on the monitor. It took almost another ten minutes after our friends arrived for this dude to come back.  We finally got to place our food orders.  Judging by the items available on the menu, CPK is to pizza what Olive Garden is to pasta.  Hooded in the cloak of Italian cuisine, both restaurants boast one type of dish as their pride and joy and, a little less proudly, also offer other common Italian fare. I got two toppings on each half of my pizza: Roasted garlic chicken on one half and mushroom pepperoni sausage on the other.  I also had a bite of the carne asada. I'd like to say something about steak on pizzas . . .  I love 'Everybody Loves Raymond.'  It's pure genius.  When Brad Garrett's character finally gets married and is taking his vows, the mom stands up to make a comment, to everyone's shock and no one's surprise.  That's what steak is like on a pizza.  Like Marie Barone, steak is a force to be reckoned with and a full meal on its own terms.  A pizza already has cheese, vegetables, and a crust.  It's Robert's wedding and it doesn't need steak to make it better.   All steak does is trample all over the wedding ceremony.  Avoid the carne asada. Get the mushroom pepperoni sausage instead.  The chunks of sausage are huge, three times bigger than the fingernail-sized pieces you find on most pizzas, and the pepperoni is pure fatty, crisp yet chewy tonguegasm.  I don't even remember if there was cheese.  I don't think it needs cheese.  The meat is enough. The roasted garlic chicken was like the ugly friend of a hot person.  Next to the pepperoni, it was a 4 at best.  Want to guess what the problem was?  You got it: Not enough salt.  I would suggest generously salting the onions while you caramelize them.  Salt releases the natural juices of the onions and makes them even more flavorful.  Then, it combines with the juices to build the flavor of the onions to the very best it can be. That's all the salt the roasted garlic chicken needs.  The mozzarella was okay and the chicken just about got away with having no seasoning so this dish could be improved just by salting the onions.  But it could be even better if CPK got a really good char on the chicken.  Salt and char will ALWAYS make your food taste better. And don't talk to me about the ""link"" between the substances in charred meat and cancer.  There is always a study that shows a ""link"" and people think it's a hard-and-fast rule.  If I tried hard enough, I could show you a correlation between the thickness of nose hair and the size of your balls. Enough paranoia.  Live, love, fuck, char. While we're on this subject, ignore CPK's calorie information next to their menu items.  If you're eating at CPK, chances are you're not on a diet prescribed by Dr. Nowzaradan.  Just order anything with pepperoni or sausage on it, avoid everything else, and remember to pencil ""stair master"" into your to-do list for the next day.

After while, sitting there clueless, one lady came with our appetizers. She was so fast, that the moment we realized we didn't have plates, she had already gone. Again we waited for our server to show up. Even though our food was there in front of us, we couldn't eat it. Finally after a while she showed up, we asked for plates. When she went to get plates, I opened the cutlery from the paper towel and what did I see, a dirty fork. I was losing it. The place was not even full, I don't know what she was busy with. She came back, while I told her about the fork, my husband realized she got us dirty plates . Really??? He was quick in letting her know, coz God knows when she will be back. She came back with cutleries and plates. At that time she bothered to ask us, do u want th complimentary bread??? We were so busy digging inc we just nodded as we were not sure. Then came our pizza, the main course, but the complimentary bread appetizers were no where in the picture. Finally she got them, but we couldn't eat it, as we were already eating our ordered food.

Beans, tomatoes, peppers, onions, and the sauce, it's as if instead of putting those things in a burrito, you just placed them on top of a pizza pie crust. If I'm in a group I always get it as one of the pizzas, since you can still try the other ones that others in the group want to try. The other two that we got were the California Club Pizza and the Thai Chicken Pizza. The Club is like a salad on a pizza; loved the big slices of avocado that were placed on top. I couldn't tell what kind of sauce/dressing was used.

I come here frequently with clients and coworkers and I have never had a problem until I came last night with my cousins.   It was NOT the food, I repeat.. NOT THE FOOD! It was the Service!!! Our waitress was horrible and she was just not with it. We were seated and we ordered some drinks but said we were expecting one more person and we wanted to wait. She took our drink orders but it took her about 15 minutes to bring us the drinks. When she finally came back she just dropped off our waters and left. We figured since our friend was running late, we would start off with an appetizer to snack on. So she finally came back again and took our orders. I ordered for my friend who was running late and myself then my cousins ordered their meals.  Our food came and it was delicious of course! I did want a refill on my water but it took her a while to come and see if... A. How our food was.. B. Can she get us anythign else.. When my friend finally arrived, our waitress did not even come to ask her if she wanted a drink or anything. Oh wait, she did after she finished her meal and was very quick to ask if we wanted dessert.  The last thing that irritated me about this experience was that when I first ordered my meal, I said I wanted to Avocado instead of the CHICKEN on my pizza since I am a vegeterian and I verified that it was STILL an equal exchange and she said YES to me. Well she charged me an additional $5.00 for avocado but when I pointed this mistake out to her she got defensive and questioned me. Again, 10 minutes later she finally came back with the corrected bill and apologized.

Hubby and I split the BBQ chicken pizza which was fine - nothing to write home about. Kids got mac and cheese and a cheese pizza, which they seemed to like. On a non-food note, the women's bathroom was nasty. I didn't dare enter two out of three stalls because they were so dirty, and the third had no toilet paper. The trash barrel was overflowing.

Last night I had postmates deliver from here and there was bacon yet again as well as a few other toppings that ended up on the pizza.

Service was pretty fast and we brought our own cake which they cut and served for us. The food menu has changed a lot since coming here a few years ago---what happened to the chicken garlic pizza CPK?!?

Anyway, the portions are pretty good, I was able to make some left overs for the future meals of tomorrow and everyone had a good time.

I used to go to the one downtown where the food was always great and the service was as well, but once that got shut down I began going to the one at the Prudential center. BIG MISTAKE! I have gone to this location twice and the service has been constantly terrible.  One my first visit we were not greeted for over 10 minutes by a server and we then had to track down the hostess to a get a server where she told us that she was unaware of who our server was and walked away. we then tracked down the manager who got just grabbed someone and told them that they were our server. The entire time he served us he kept asking that we nit write a bad review and when we left the manager asked us to write a nice review. I found that to be very unprofessional and uncomfortable.However my worst experience was one my 2nd and last time at this location. I was planning to celebrate my boyfriends birthday there with some friend. I called first and asked if I could bring a cake in and then come back because it was a surprise. When I delivered the cake the host seemed very annoyed that she had to walk the 2 feet to put t in the freezer and the guy doing take out window seemed even more peeved to put it in the freezer. On that note I asked for it to stay out as it had to defrost and that I would be back with my party in a hour. When we returned to eat I noticed the cake was not out so I once again asked the hostess to make sure that the cake was taken out so it could defrost and if she could ask our server to bring it at the end of the meal. After waiting 15 minutes for our server who was exceptionally slow and also seemed to be annoyed when we asked for water with lemon (she blatantly rolled her eyes)we ordered. Towards the end of the meal I was already a bit annoyed by the service, she was slow, and never refilled our glasses. I asked her if she could bring out the cake ad she said that she assumed I and the hostess would bring it out although I specifically gave it to the restaurant so my server could bring it, I went back to the hostess stand to ask about the cake. Although it had only been 1 hour she seemed to not remember me nor the cake and told me that she didnt know if it was taken out and that I should ask the guy at take out. When I went over to ask him he also seemed confused and told me he forgot to take it out. At that point I was so annoyed I went and spoke with the manager who was less than helpful as he just told me to sit and wait.After waiting ANOTHER 10 minutes I asked for the check and to just take my still frozen cake home with me, It was the worst CPK experience I have ever had and I will never go back, nor will the people in my party.

Once I finished, the only taste left in my mouth was that of dough and salt. I also believe that this pizza used to come with truffle oil, which contributed to the deliciousness. This is now an optional item (extra $$). I usually get it with chicken (extra $$) and even the texture of the little chicken that was on there was different. the pieces were completely cold too. I really hope that these changes are limited to this location only and were not a change as part of a corporate initiative to reduce cost/increase profit margins on their pizzas.

She was warm, friendly, and (possibly most of all) patient (I couldn't make up my mind on what pizza to get). Amanda was super helpful in mentioning that they can do half-and-half pizzas, for those who want to share two different kinds of toppings, or if you want to try two for yourself. So there we were, happily eating our pizzas, when the house lights suddenly and inexplicably got much brighter.  This was not a temporary failure but something that seemed designed to make people leave. If I wasn't eating, and didn't have another whole bottle of Newcastle Brown Ale to drink, I certainly would have left pretty quickly.

In the past, I have ordered and stuck with the California Club, which is essentially greens/avocado on top of a pizza topped with chicken and bacon. This pizza never disappoints and satisfies both my salad and pizza fixes. :) The staff is always super friendly as well. Also, you can ask for bread and butter/oil after you are seated!

The wedge salad was very plain, like a Cobb salad in wedge form, but the blue cheese dressing was unimpressive. Not bad, just not particularly good. The pesto cream penne with chicken was more flavorful and creamy, but nothing to write home about. The flavors were simply dull.

However, didn't know where to go on the weekend and stepped in here.  Glad to say I was very relieved that this is a NORMAL CPK, with none of the shadiness attached.  The chicken tequila fettucini actually has chicken inside and the pizza actually had toppings on it! haha.   Not asking for much, really.

The pizzas are $10-15, but are really personal sized. You could get a much better pizza from Upper Crust or Figs for about $20 that feeds 2-3 people. The Habanero Carnitas and Jamaican Jerk pizzas are good, but the others are mediocre at best (I've actually tried them all).

I ordered a piece of cheesecake and a spinach artichoke pizza with honey wheat crust.  I waited for about 20 minutes and swatted at some fruit flies while I waited.  Side note observation:  their ""bar"" is pitiful.  About 15 bottles of bottom shelf liquor.  I'm not sure how many different drinks that can make, but when they're lined up on the ledge above the pizza prep table, I'm not impressed.  Liquor deserves special treatment. My pizza and cheesecake finally arrived, and so did my bill.  No discount.  So I had to wave down the manager, who made a slight deal about it, until he corrected my tab.   When I got home, the pizza wasn't on the honey whole wheat crust, but whatever.  I had a couple pieces and then went to take a few bites of the cheesecake.  Brrr.  The cheesecake was still frozen.  Not only did it survive transit on top of the pizza as I brought it home, but it sat in the apartment for approximately 20 more minutes as I ate my pizza.  Still frozen?  Pitiful.  I'll get my CPK from my local Shaw's from now on, thanks.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston-2?start=100

Dimitri D.,"Worcester, United States",5,34,,4.0,24/10/2010,A Review of California Pizza Kitchen. By Dimitri D. What you can expect from this fine Boston restaurant is pretty good traditional American/Italian food. I came here with my cousins as well as my brother. I had a pepperoni pizza and everyone else ordered varying forms of pasta. The pizza was delicious and very well portioned. I also tried a bite of my brother's spaghetti and meat sauce which was very tasty as well. The woman who served us was helpful and nice but also appeared kinda bored. Maybe she just had a bad day. All-in-all I would recommend this restaurant and would definitely return.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston-2?start=100

So I called them reserved a table for my birthday and for my surprise there were no reservation when my friends and I arrived. We ended-up getting a table 30 min after, so it wasn't that bad.

I was too lazy to suggest an alternative, and I had some errands to run in the area, so I agreed.  Service is SLOW. It didn't even seem too crowded/ busy.

When we were here, we were served by this one waitress that tended to avoid eye contact with us : we would raise our hands to flag her down, for sure make eye contact, but she'd never come.

L H.,"Boston, United States",4,125,,2.0,21/6/2006,"This particular branch restaurant is very conveniently located inside the Copley mall right next to the bridge across Mariott Hotel side. The food is well-controlled and taste about the same as the other branch on Stuart st. between Wang Center and the common.But I find their food taste a bit shallow and very sweet.  What I find awkward is the young diners, who are mainly dressed like they are sitting there dying to be displayed. You will have to see it yourself to find lots of people wearing hats and sunglasses while eating, i.e. Men with tight jeans showing the bulging tummies, girls chatting on the phone till they leave. The next drawback is the waiting service. In general, the food is served extremely slow and it can take 1-1.5 hours to sit and have a quick lunch. I advise that  ordering appetizers definitely slows down the next course.  Personally, we had a bad waitress who did not get us a menu for first 15 min. and the drinks were delivered after another 20 min. And, appetizer was served for another 40 minutes later.  When we were leaving without leaving any tip for her, she confronted us at the door poking my back with the receipt plate. And I had to have a good talk with the manager about the slow service and mostly the rudeness I experienced from that waitress. Whether it was the waitress's negligence or the kitchen forgetting the orders, it was never explained to us and the waitress knew we were not happy, yet still confronting us for not leaving any tip or expediting the service. I stopped going there because of that incident, plus, the menu is barely changed and because the food tastes like take out Chinese cooked with any combination of 5 sauces and 4 different meats.

We were seated quickly, and the restaurant was a nice place but the serve was sarcastic and although I suspect he was trying to be funny, failed miserably. We waited quite a bit for our water. Yes, water. And then we ordered some pizza, salad, etc. As I was drinking my water I looked down to see things floating in it. My first thought: Ew, did they wash this glass? Then I saw it. A spider. Floating around. I think it took about five years off my lifespan. My waiter took quite a bit of time to notice my hand in the air, and when I said ""there's a spider in my water"" he answered ""I put it there just for you."" Yeah, okay, his tone was just obnoxious.  I will admit the manager was very kind and apologized, she gave us a free appetizer and a bottle of water. Then the water came back with plates, and there was one plate that my sister was able to wipe off a whole load of gunk with her napkin. Hm...do they wash their dishes there? So we got a new one, and our serve admitted we were not having good luck. The food finally came, and my two sisters were sitting across from each other and sharing a salad. My older sister had just put the first bite into her mouth and started chewing when my little sister was like, ""Look, a hair!"" Sure enough, there was a curly black hair that had come along for the ride. Lovely. I raised my hand once again and waited for the server, whose response was ""you're kidding, right?"" The manager came back and apologized once again, saying nothing like this had ever happened before. Yeah, right. We left, without eating, at least we didn't have to pay for the food.

Big mistake. I ordered the roasted vegetable salad with chicken, a cpk kobb salad, and a meat cravers pizza. I was told it would be prepared in 20 minutes. When I returned in 20 minutes the woman (who was not at the take out window every-time I showed up) told me she was just waiting for the vegetables for the salad.  Another 25 minutes went by until I got my food. 45 minutes later, after ordering, I got a wonderful cobb salad (the only redeemer) , a very cold undercooked pizza, and a roasted vegetable salad that had 4 stips, roughly a quarter of a chicken breast, which was also cold.  So I totally get the up charge at restaurants, BUT that $4 chicken add on could have bought 5 chicken breasts at a grocery store.

My girlfriend had a red sangria, and I tried both the top Shelf long island iced tea as well as the strawberry mojito. I liked the iced tea better, as the mojito was a little hard to navigate, I was getting pieces of fruit jammed in my straw every sip.

Allison R.,"Somerville, United States",239,689,173,2.0,13/3/2009,"Review #200, here goes... I was reclining on the couch last night with a hookah and some television (typical night at The Home), lamenting that I was standing at the precipice of a milestone: Yelp Review 200. I had started and stopped a couple reviews that I felt were not worthy, but the truth is, I simply was not inspired. My roommate said he ought to sit down someday and read my reviews, and asked if I had Yelped the CPK that touched my avocado. Gasp! I had not...until now.  It was a crisp spring night, and we had tried to go to multiple Cheesecake Factory locations with no luck-- every restaurant required at least a 45 minute wait, and we were huuung-ry. The solution turned out to be this California Pizza Kitchen, where we were able to be seated at the bar immediately.  Our waitress/bartender seemed moderately ticked that we ordered just a water and a coke, and nothing from the bar. She kind of disdainfully poured our drinks and plopped them down in front of us. We ordered, and whatever pizza I chose was topped with slivers of avocado-- probably the defining reason I chose it. I saw our food come out of the kitchen (I was starving and watching for our food like a hawk), and noticed the pizza lacked avocado. The waitress then proceeded to reach her-- gloveless (!)-- hand into a plastic cube and place the coveted green goodness on top of the pizza...with said ungloved hand! One dropped on the cutting board below, and she made sure not to waste it and added it to my pizza. Gross. I ate the pizza anyway, but when we got glared at for ordering refills on our drinks, that sealed the deal on the service.  The bill arrived and we left a meager tip (under 50 cents, if memory serves) along with a note: ""Be nice and you'll get better tips. :( PS- We saw the avocado."" Sure, it was mean and vindictive, but oh so true. Looking like you don't want to serve your customers makes them feel like tipping you is optional.

Wanting something inside the mall (it was POURING) and with quick service, we stopped here and found out it was a 10 minute wait. Pretty good for a Friday night! We got sat really fast and our waiter was awesome - patient, funny, helpful. We ended up sharing the The Original BBQ Chicken Chopped (Chopped lettuce, black beans, sweet corn, jicama, cilantro, basil, crispy corn tortilla strips and Monterey Jack cheese tossed together in herb ranch dressing - we got the balsamic and the ranch on the side. Topped with chopped BBQ chicken breast, diced tomatoes and green onions) and the Chinese Chicken Salad (Shredded Napa cabbage, crisp iceberg and crispy wontons tossed with julienne carrots, red cabbage, green onions, toasted sesame seeds and fresh cilantro in a spicy sweet & sour sesame dressing. Topped with chilled-grilled chicken breast). We liked the BBQ better, but both were great. For our main course, we shared the Roasted Garlic Chicken pizza (Roasted garlic, grilled chicken, Mozzarella cheese, mild onions and Italian parsley with a white wine and garlic-shallot butter sauce) which was quite tasty, but was not as good as the Thin Crust Pepperoni Supremo (Italian Pomodoro sauce with pepperoni, Mozzarella, Parmesan and fresh Mozzarella cheeses. Topped with fresh herbs). This was by far the favorite of the table! We didn't get any bread, but we didn't need it. For 4 people, this was a great meal and we were pretty full after!

The food here is mediocre when compared to other chain restaurants and I'm not the only one who thinks so. CPK makes the Cheesecake Factory look amazing, in my opinion. CPK serves up the same kind of food, but lacking in quantity and quality. When I eat at Cheesecake Factory, I can get a dish with no starches (a salad, a soup) and leave incredibly full and sometimes, with leftovers! I've ordered burgers and pizzas at CPK and left hungry after eating everything on my plate. Now, their food isn't HORRIBLE, but I'd say in comparison to other chains, they're beat in more ways than one.  Example: Thai Lettuce Wraps: one of my favorite appetizers to order as an entree. Cheesecake? One of those and I can barely inhale. CPK? I need to order an app to eat before my entree comes out. Maybe you're thinking that my stomach was in a different condition on each of those days. You're right, it was. I was hungrier when I went to Cheesecake, but left more satisfied with more money in my pocket. So what do you think of that? Anyways, it's just in my opinion that CPK loses to nearly all chains.

We were seated quickly and that's when the fun times ended. The waitress though pleasant, did not have her act together. First it took about 10 minutes for us to get waters. Then it took about 3o minutes for the first of our sandwiches/personal pizzas/soup/salads to arrive and there was at least a 15 minute gap between when the first of us and last of us was served our main meal. Also, she must have thought that the word  ""tortilla""  sounded like ""asparagus"" because instead of the warm bowl of Mexican soup I was expected, I was instead presented with an oddly green steaming concoction. Not usually a big deal, but by this point all I could think of was ""come on already!"". The food itself was not prepared the way we requested it. The kitchen decided that my friend asking for no cheese on her pizza meant that they could still top it with ""queso"" sauce......I ordered the Tuscan Salad off of the small cravings menu and it was gross. The cannelli  beans were mealy and the dressing tasted like straight flavorless oil. 6 dollars for a cup of untastey veggies? never again.  The tortilla soup(when it finally arrived) was flavorless, and reminded me of cardboard.

Hisham K.,"Cambridge, United States",38,104,,4.0,12/11/2008,"I love the pizzas at CPK, and the service is usually very good. This CPK in particular made me laugh until my BBQ chicken pizza nearly came out of my nose. I was sitting at my table with my friend Melis, eating my pizza while she had her soup. Suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I saw something streak across the floor right past our table. At first I thought it was the glint of someone's jewelry reflecting on my glasses, but when I turned around to look at the gray streak of lighting, it actually turned out to be a mouse. Certainly, that is no laughing matter. A mouse in a restaurant? You may as well have a can of Raid at every table sitting next to the salt & pepper! That mouse had jetted across the floor of a VERY crowded restaurant located in a MALL on a FRIDAY NIGHT. And NO ONE saw it. Serious bravado. I caught the attention of a passing waitress. ""I don't mean to cause any alarm or anything,"" I began to say, ""but I just saw something..."" ""Oh,"" she cut me off, ""Was it the mouse?"" I paused for a moment and hissed, ""What do you mean THE mouse??"" That's right. They knew about the mouse. She told me that they're right above the Green line, and sometimes the mouse turns up... but she assured me that it's harmless and that the kitchen is squeaky clean. At first I was incredulous. I could not fathom this. CPK has a pet mouse! Soon after we left, Melis and I just couldn't stop laughing at the whole thing. I have said nearly nothing about CPK itself, although I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this chain (other than this little mascot they have running around). Their pizzas are great, their salads are awesome, and the venue is always clean. And even though I saw a mouse in this restaurant with my own eyes, I still eat there because the food is just so damn good. Yes, my taste buds may need some fine-tuning, but that's just me. Talk about a brand positioning success - even though there's a mouse in the equation, I still prefer CPK over Pizza Hut. :)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston-2?start=120
Adam Z.,"Los Angeles, United States",276,229,48,1.0,25/11/2008,"Where to begin, well to start off I have been to this location of California Pizza Kitchen four times before. Previously they've been great.  On Monday night (11/25/08) my brother and I decided to grab some dinner here after shopping. The place wasn't packed at all with empty tables everywhere (half the restaurant was empty).  Yet the hostess told us there would be a 20 minutes wait. We asked for a medium or large booth (not a small one).  We asked nicely what the reason for the wait was (due to the very apparent emptiness) she replied that they only had 3 waiters and were understaffed. We said okay and asked her if we had to wait or if we could go browse the shops and come back in 15 minutes). She said ""Yes that's fine but be back in 20 minutes not 15. We found her reply a bit abrasive but ignored it. We came back 20 minutes later and they were packed (every table). Not only that but she said they had a medium booth open but it was just taken and now we would have to wait 30 (more) minutes unless we wanted to take a small both. My brother was rather upset and wanted to leave to go to Cheese Cake Factory but I calmed him down and said let's just take the small booth (I should have trusted his instincts and left). Now to the fun. The small booths at this place, keep in mind my brother and I aren't big guys we're both 5'10"" - 5' 11"" and are average weight for our height. These small booths were made for stick figures. There's no way to be comfortable in them. Add to that the table can barely hold the plates the serve due to the width. Not only that but the small booth they sat us at was right in middle of the high traffic error and at the mid-height wall next to us we the waiters register/station was there. So while we were chatting/eating we'd constantly have a waiter staring at us from the other side of the mid-height wall next to the booth. Now that we have the bad seating of this restaurant out of the way to the good stuff...not... So we get our appetizer and enjoy it (they have decent food in my opinion).Before we can finish our appetizer our waiter brings out our entrees (huge no no when waiting ones table in my opinion). So we're eating our entrees and we're half way done, then the waiter comes to the table and says having desserts guys? My brother replies ""most likely but we're still eating our food"" the waiter replied ""I'll come back in a few"".  We finish our food and the waiter brings us our check. My brother is extremely upset as am I due to the fact that the waiter knew we wanted dessert. So we finally get the waiters attention and ask for the dessert menu. He lives and we start looking over the dessert menu. We know what we're getting and wait for the waiter to come back. As we're waiting from underneath our booth two cockroaches come crawling up the wall. YES that's right cockroaches! I nearly throw up but decided to just up and leave the restaurant. We didn't make a scene my brother waited at the table quietly for the manager. 10 minutes go by and the manager doesn't show. The hostess walks by and says to my brother ""Did you enjoy your meal?"" He pointed at one of the roaches and she took one of our used napkins and killed one of them (the other had gone somewhere else by that time). The manager told my brother in not so many words 'What can we do to make up for this and keep it quiet?' End result being we got our meal free (which didn't make up for anything to me). I felt bad for everyone eating in that restaurant at that time if they knew surely they'd all leave. Now that I think back on it maybe we should have made a scene out of respect for everyone else.  To end this review that was all of the bad. The good was our waiter was very friendly he just seemed inexperienced. Also the food was decent but makes me sick thinking of the roaches.  I'd like to warn everyone to stay away for this location of California Pizza Kitchen at all costs.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston-2?start=120

I would stick to the original sauce/topping combos, though, and avoid regular tomato/meat pizzas - they don't compare well with great traditional pizza restaurants.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston-2?start=120
courtney d.,"Boston, United States",15,33,,4.0,1/5/2006,"I seriously love this place.  I actually usually get the same thing whenever I go, the Thai lettuce wraps and the BLT pizza. I've had lettuce wraps everywhere possible, and these are the best I've had in awhile, they aren't too spicy either.  And even though I know the cheesecake factory gives a bigger portion, these win hands down. And yeah, you have to be brave to order lettuce on a pizza, but trust me its worth the risk.  It tastes exactly like the sandwich, but a whole lot better.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston-2?start=120
Gordon f.,"Needham, United States",0,35,,3.0,2/5/2009,"Decent pizza, but unspectacular.  Pizza's are kinda small for the kind of money they charge, $10- 12 for a small  (approx. 10""). Service  was excellent though, food came promptly and drinks were always full.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston-2?start=180
