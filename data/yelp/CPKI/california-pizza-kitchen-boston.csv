Mark T.,"Salem, MA",181,368,312,3.0,5/12/2014,"I may overuse the word ""good""... If I come back, I will get pizza that time, and I will get it to go. I may overuse the word ""good""... : I will talk about my complaints at the bottom, now, on with the review.  The bread and oil they give you is good. Usually the bread in restaurants is under-cooked, I can tell because the insides can be squeezed, and will stay mushed like play-dough. this stuff re-rose. Oil and the herbs in it were good too.  Even though this is a pizza place, I had the fish tacos. The Tacos were ""good"" but not ""very."" They were light, airy, but were kind of lacking in flavor, or rather spices a bit. The chips that came with them were good, nothing too special. Salsa was great though, did taste hose-made, and fire-roasted.  My experience was not particularly bad in terms in the food, but it was a little unpleasant in some other respects. When I went, it was not at all busy, and yet the service was extremely slow, I mean WICKED slow. Maybe it was because the waiter was a little new, but the service was inexcusably slow, especially for the money you are paying.  Also there was a problem with attention to detail. While the restaurant was not unclean, the salt and pepper shakers were full of salt and pepper, but were dirty. And, when I ordered a dessert that was supposed to have some sea salt on top, but didn't.  In any case, it was still good, just not worth the money for tasty pudding with caramel.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston
Court S.,"East Bay, CA",929,872,1775,3.0,1/17/2013,The service was slow as hell. The restaurant was empty so I don't understand why. The fettuccini Alfredo was only ok. Half way through eating it I started to suddenly not like the taste. Something was off.... My niece ordered cheese pizza that was good.  Maybe I'm just used to food tasting fresher and more flavorful in California.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston
Kristine A.,"Boston, MA",224,434,10,3.0,12/11/2013,"I am usually a fan of CPK but feel like the past several years they have been going downhill.  The change in menu & how things are made, not as good as before. As a NYer I have certain standards for pizza & this used to be way better. At least they still have the honey wheat dough but it seems to be less tasty than before. I think the service has been hit or miss & I've been coming to this location for probably a decade. I usually don't run into any issues here but I basically did the last time I I was here. I don't like when you have to repeat things to your server several times when trying to order, but even worse don't make me wait to order either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston
Nishita V.,"Mississauga, Canada",27,83,202,4.0,11/17/2013,"Stopped in for a quick little solo dinner here one night while in Boston for a conference. I've heard such great things about the food at CPK so I thought I'd give it a try.  I ordered two small apps. Corn chips with guac, fried mac and cheese and a drink. Both items were delicious but unfortunately, I didn't get my drink until I was almost done for my food and even then I had to ask for it twice. Great food, but I give it four stars because of the mediocre service.  I'll probably et at CPK again. There are lots of things on the menu I'd love to try so next time I'll pop in with some friends so we can share!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston

We came in and there was no one at the host stand or even a server for a couple of minutes. Our drinks came after this party that sat down after us, and my frozen mango lemonade took even longer to arrive. The food was meh. My co workers pizza was burnt under the salad (salad pizza).

Vivian C.,"Boston, MA",126,1441,14582,3.0,5/18/2009,"My go-to dish at this chain is the bbq chicken chopped salad (YUM!), but I haven't had that in a while.  Dishes here are sized to satiate one average diner, but I can normally split 2 between three people.  So we shared the cobb salad, an asparagus spinach pasta with the add-on of salmon, and three pizzas: Chicken Garlic, Hawaiian, and The Works. The pizza crusts were thin and soft and crispy.  The salad refreshing.  Everything was okay, but nothing to get excited about. + the pineapple on the Hawaiian didn't look like the canned sort... maybe fresh? - $4+ for the salmon add on was a bit much, given the portion +/- pleasant waitress, but we were often looking for her *** 5/2011 visit *** It seems to be the trend here that service is friendly enough, but lacking... today the requested bread never arrived, and the box for leftovers were long in coming... never mind that my water refill could not be requested at the time of need because the server was busy for much of our meal time.

Katie C.,"Boston, MA",180,587,92,2.0,9/10/2013,"We stopped in one night to grab some appetizers before heading over to a show.  Hubs is the parking whisperer so when he scored a prime-time spot on the street in front of the restaurant, I knew we would end up here one way or another.  We walked into the restaurant around 6:00 on a Saturday night and we should have been tipped off that the restaurant was virtually empty.  On a Saturday night, that should have clued us in.  Regardless, we've dined at the Braintree location more than I'd like to admit, so maybe our standards were high?  When we explained we were just going to sit at the bar, we were given a look of discontent.  We only wanted appetizers and rather than holding up a table for a measly $30 check, this was going to be it. We sat at the bar.  And sat.  And sat.  And about 5 minutes later, we were greeted by a server and we ordered both our drinks and appetizers -- chips and guac followed by an order of taquitos.  When the server came back and asked what we wanted for dinner, we politely explained that this was it and once again, were were given a subtle eye roll.   Overall, the food was just okay.  The food wasn't hot (temperature wise), but it wasn't cold and it was to about the same standards of the corporate-chain-restaurant-level, but nothing spectacular.  The service was sour at best. So if you're looking to grab a quick bite before a show, cross this off your list.  Mediocre food and subpar service just isn't worth the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston
Marceline V.,"Boston, MA",19,158,101,2.0,3/17/2013,"Talk about cramped!  Let me start over, I enjoyed my salad here at CPK, I had the caramelized peach salad and it was yummy.

Andria T.,"Providence, RI",72,198,17,3.0,9/16/2013,"We stopped here for a bite and a drink before a 7:30 show on Tremont and left happy and full.  While this certainly wasn't a dinner with a lot of ambiance, it got the job done and I would likely go back. The first thing our server asked was if we were on our way to a show.  I appreciated that very much, and he did mind the time pretty well.  We were a little late because we opted for another beer, but it wasn't a curtain call situation, so it was no big deal. I got the wild mushroom pizza--hand tossed and BF got the works.  We were both pleased with our choices and one pizza was just the right size for each of us (I had had a small lunch).  It was a little hard to get a sense of how big the pizzas would be since no one sitting near us was actually eating one (which was odd, but maybe they all just got there?), but the server said it was 10.5 inches diameter for the hand-tossed, and that was just the right size for one, kind of greedy person. So, the food was good, the service was good, the restaurant itself was a lot like eating in a cafeteria.  Maybe that's the ""California"" aspect of this place because the decor was kind spare like something you would find near a beach.  The booths we sat in had no divider wall between ours and the one on the other side, so I kept finding myself staring at other diners.  Also, it got pretty loud later on. Overall, I left full and happy. This would not be my first place to eat--indeed it wasn't even the first choice the night we went, but it got the job done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston

Joe H.,"ALLSTON, MA",10,59,15,1.0,11/15/2013,"The place felt bright and sterile like a cafeteria. The sangria was flat and had no evidence of club soda. My cola tasted bad. The waitress forgot to put the salad order through. The chicken club pizza barely had any chicken on it and you could hardly tell it was a pizza because there was a mayonnaise salad on top of it. The Gorgonzola pizza was sweet but not salty or savory. Crust was bubbly, crispy, and hollow. It fell apart and tasted more like a cracker. If you want a good alternative style pizza, go to Otto instead. You will not be disappointed. Avoid this place like the plague!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston

They are currently running a lunch special of some if their popular dishes with a beverage for $9. Good deal! The staff at this location can be great or just plain bad. Luckily, I've had more great than bad, but the bad is bad and has made me question going back, but then I do and get great service so they are redeemed!

Michelle T.,"Portland, ME",173,507,227,2.0,11/25/2010,"There are definitely better CPK places out there. We came here at noon (group of 8) and had to wait 1 full 10 minutes before someone came out to seat us in this 85% empty restaurant. We asked for bread after we ordered and it took another 15 minutes before it came out. Our lunches took even LONGER. Sad, considering we all ordered salads and sandwiches.  The salad I had was fine - mediocre at best, but for $13, it was NOT WORTH IT at all. The chicken salad had few toppings, including the butternut squash. One person ordered a salad that she described as ""GROSS"" as the greens were soggy and drenched in dressing (probably to cover it up.)  It's fine. Not anything amazing and definitely not a place I'd go back to again.

Over the past year I've had lunch here probably once a month or so, whenever I visit my mother for lunch. We like the fast lunch service, the server who we usually get and is pleasant, and the low/fair prices. It's nothing to write home about it terms of great food, but a solid place for something dependable that isn't gross. They seem to be pushing their new mini-apps (they have some quirky name, I think ""small cravings"") and I tried a corn-guac dip that was fine. Only problem - if I get a pizza, hold the cheese, add avocado, how are you going to still charge me full price plus the add on for the avocado?

Julia F.,"Somerville, MA",297,840,193,2.0,2/6/2011,"It's not italian food, it's a chain pizza joint. I get that. I wasn't sure what to expect after seeing a whole bunch of frozen pizza stuffs at the grocery store with the same brand name on it.  A group of about 7 of us found ourselves meeting up in the theater district for a comedy show, and this was the easiest place to meet for a few beers and share a pizza before the show (and heavy drinking) occurred.  I'm not sure what aspect of this cuisine is derived from Cali, I've never even been that far West, personally. It is so-so food. Nothing about the experience would make me come back here though. Nothing stands out about the food, which I think is why I'm not crazy about chain restaurants in general --- all the foods seem to taste very similar to me... It was smaller than the mall stores I've seen elsewhere in the area, which was nice. The service was pretty good, and our waitress in particular was very nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston
Taja M.,"Attleboro, MA",116,25,,3.0,3/17/2013,"Hey Yelpers...haven't reviewed anywhere in a long time. Although I've been out, just haven't had the chance to come on here. Tonight's experience was Yelp-worthy. So its my friends 29th bday. A whole bunch of ppl were supposed to come out to celebrate, but it was just her sister, my best friend and I. Anywho, we decided to go here. It was my 1st time ever eating here but I knew of the one in the Prudential but some reason never went in. So, my first impression was that it was a glorified cafe, like a step up from au bon pain, but only because they served alcohol and they had waiters/waitresses. I hadn't yelped this place beforehand which would have been better if i did, but again, my mind wasnt there. Anyway, all of us looked nice, especially the bday girl. I ordered the appetizer and it was the spinach dip with tortilla chips. Which was priced at $9.75, it was very delicious, not too cheesy, not too spinachy, just right. I only wished they werent so cheap and actually filled the bowl with some dip. I'm sorry but i can make my own and it would be loads less or i could buy the unhealthy brand of tostitos spinach and cheese dip from the store and a bag of tortilla chips and still spent less. I hadnt eaten all day so i was ravenous...that may have been a contributing factor. So I couldnt decide what i wanted but i know i did not want pizza...sorry i know thats your signature and trust me, they had a very extensive pizza list that took up 75% of the menu, lol. But I ended up going with the Jambalaya pasta sans crawfish (yuck!) or whatever it was called. It was listed as spicy, and yea for someone who doesnt like spicy foods that may have been a lil spicy but it wasnt for me. I think it had sausage bits, shrimp and chicken. Hated the shrimp so i gave the majority of them to my bestie and then the meal was complete. The meat was seasoned well but the pasta lacked flavor, however the spice made up for the taste and although salt was bad, they couldve added some natural flavor like cilantro or tomato i think that would've been really pungent. Bestie didnt like her food and birthday girl and her sister shared a salad with peaches, which they loved. Our waiters name was Alonzo and he was a sweetheart. Very accomodating. Overall a great experience...CPK did not WOW me but I will say id give them another couple of chances when I was less ravenous and order the same pasta as well as come back another time to try their pizza and maybe a different appetizer. I indulged in 2 glasses of pepsi which believe it or not is totally not like me, I've been a 95% water girl since last October and I'm loving it. Trust me, it was a weak moment and won't happen again.  Hope you enjoyed this review...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston
Erica D.,"Revere, MA",26,64,21,3.0,3/8/2011,"After much trudging through the unexpected snowstorm, my friend and I decided to have dinner at the California Pizza Kitchen. We walked in and the restaurant was packed. We were told that the wait would be 15 - 20 minutes so we were happy to take a seat or stand awkwardly in front of the door until our name was called.  After an appropriate amount of time we were seated in front of the kitchen. We had no waiter. We sat there for 20 minutes before someone from the kitchen took our drink order. If the weather wasn't so ridiculously awful that day, we would have left! Once we put in our order the food arrived pretty quickly, and it was really good. I got the Japanese eggplant pizza with whole wheat crust--excellent. My friend got the chicken lettuce wraps and an arugula salad, which were both tasty. The people in the kitchen know their shiz!  Then our waiter went missing, he came by once to refill my friend's iced tea early in the meal. Unfortunately, instead of getting her a new cup with ice, he refilled her glass at the table (which had almost no ice) with freshly brewed iced tea. I.E., still warm. He never came back to refill my water or ask if I wanted another Riesling wine (which I didn't, it tasted like it was cut with sprite). After we finished eating, we sat and talked for another 20 or so minutes. The crowded restaurant quickly became empty and we were aware that we were the only people in our section. Our waiter made a few passes by us, exiting/entering the kitchen each time. Again, we were seated in front of the kitchen, is this a blind spot? Finally he brought out the check. Then I had to flag him down to make the transaction. He thanked us and said good night, a few minutes later he returned asking how to handle the cash/credit card combo. First day on the job, buddy? Don't most waiters ask if you need change before assuming that you left them a tip. What if we had paid in cash, would he have walked off with the difference?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston?start=20

This location is tucked inside the Boston City Plaza food court barely visible from the street in the theatre district. It is a smaller location but has the same type of menu and service as other locations.

While I like the variety of selections they offer I find the pizzas to be on the small side and prciey. So while certainly better than your average pizza joint if you want a creative pizza there are a number of places serving larger, better quality and cheaper creative pizza's in Boston. That said I had the pear and gorgonzola pizza with some chicken added to it. The pizza was very tasty although it looked a bit strange as it had what looked like a small salad on top of it. The pears and hazelnuts tasted very good with the gorgonzola and salad topping. The staff were friendly and tolerant of the fact that we were all borderline drunk.

I should add that I'm not a fan of particularly strong cheese and cheese-like flavours. The staff were very attentive, knowledgeable about their menu, and friendly. Dinner was a Cobb salad and the aforementioned mushroom pizza; it was satisfying, and I would return to CPK again if I wanted to try another unique dish.

Stephanie G.,"Somerville, MA",61,201,,3.0,11/7/2009,"So I'm walking around Boston with a bunch of foreigners looking for pizza. So we see this place. It says pizza. Alright. I'd never heard of it, but we can't go too wrong. It definitely has a feel of a chain restaurant (which it is), but the service is good and friendly. We got three pizzas for four people - I would say normally they would feed one person a pizza - and they're all around $11 so it's definitely a little pricey.  The menu is kinda curious - very unconventional pizzas like ""cheese burger pizza"" and ""shrimp scampi pizza"". We got The Works (a meat pizza) which was savory and good, the pear and gorgonzola, which came with a surprise salad...on the pizza, and a margerita pizza - probably the most disappointing because it had no flavor. My foreigners ate the pizzas happily, but it was definitely not what they were expecting. If you want some wacky pizzas that are a little overpriced in a sort of sterile atmosphere, then I would recommend this place for you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston?start=20

I must have eaten CPK more than 5 times a week at one point! Although I don't head here as often anymore, I still go back for the salads! Its hard to find a good salad in Boston and the the BBQ Chicken Salad (I now do it with avocado instead of chicken as a vegetarian) and the Thai Crunch are both GREAT!  The staff here is more international than any of the other locations. They are also sometimes more surly, but I attribute that to the theater crowd.

The crust is sort of lifeless and flat - no taste, no jump, nothing to set off the ingredients on the pizza. The ingredients are all fresh, don't get me wrong - but the pizza simply fails to be in any way remarkable. The bread they place on the table is simply sliced italian bread you can purchase at any store. A wood fired grill you really would want to make their own. The shrimp roll crammed full of cilantro really didn't taste like anything except that. The desserts are good, but nothing spectacular. Decor - Whatever. There really isn't much to speak of. Each CPK is much the same - the giant open space feels a little like a stadium - and the giant glass wall facing whatever street you happen to be on makes you feel a little like you're in the .406 club at the Sox game. It's loud, boisterous and family-oriented, which isn't a bad thing - but there's nothing really here to recommend it.  Service - a shining gem. The waitstaff is friendly, knowledgeable, and most of all, well-versed in what the food tastes like! When my girlfriend and I go out to eat, she often has questions about different dishes - she likes to really pick the thing she's going to like best. She'll ask ""How's the ____?"" or ""How fresh is your _____?"" Waitstaff who give blank stares, or who say things like ""I don't really eat here"" lose a lot of points in my book. Our server most recently, and in visits past, had a lot of personal feedback about the food. This, above all else, distinguishes CPK. Crowd - again, Whatevs. Shoppers, people who couldn't get into the Cheesecake Factory, random people, families, it's a mishmash. Again, not a bad thing, but overall just a place to get food, as opposed to a crowd-type of place. Overall, CPK is just a place to feed. Aside from the fantastic service, there's nothing special about it. True, there's nothing *bad* about it, it's just rather unremarkable. If you want great pizza, go to Caruso's in Melrose, or Santarpio's in East Boston. If you want great apps, hit the Naked Fish. If you want great desserts, go to the North End.

But I've never been disappointed in the food I've gotten from them. For around $10 you can have a full sandwich with a side salad and a cup of soup, and neither of the sides are really that small. I've gotten the cranberry walnut chicken salad sandwich, the grilled chicken sandwich, the pea and barley soup, and the caesar salad, all in different combinations and all satisfying. Last time, I got a half size of the Thai crunch salad, which was so gigantic I couldn't eat it all in one sitting.

Alicia Y.,"Brighton, MA",21,112,92,4.0,5/28/2008,"CPK was a happy accident for me.  Having grown up in the sticks of northern New England, I had never heard of CPK until a few months ago when some coworkers invited me there for lunch, raving about how it was one of their favorite eateries.  On my maiden CPK voyage I was not terribly impressed: the Hawaiian pizza was tasty, but for some reason it did not really taste like genuine *pizza* to me - the dough was too chewy, the toppings were too pretty, and the choices were too elaborate (who the hell wants shrimp scampi on a slice of pie?).   However, not wanting to be the party pooper, I went again when my coworkers invited me again a few weeks later.  I tried a BBQ chicken pizza, and again, it just did not taste like real old-fashioned pizza... yet again, I found myself chowing down.  What was the deal?  By the third trip, I no longer cared - I had accepted that CPK does not conform to my usual pizza standards (meaning Crazy Dough's) but that I can still enjoy it as it exists in its own pizza-esque-but-not-quite universe.  I relish that I can order shrimp-scampi-topped non-pizza that I eat with a knife and fork while sitting in overly-trendy-to-the-point-of-garishness surroundings.  I revel in sipping non-alcoholic pina coladas to complement my pretty Hawaiian pie and petite, delectable appetizers, which I eat while wondering if the waiter/waitress that day will lean in awkwardly close... wait, no, I don't revel in that last part.  The one drawback to this CPK is that the waitstaff have NO conception of personal space - and when they aren't leaning two inches from your face to ask if you wanted Canadian bacon on that, they are hoping you choke to death on your complimentary bread so they can go home early.  Not the friendliest lot, but maybe they are just angry that their pizza is not *real* pizza.

When I went down to pick up my order the takeout section was closed, and there was no one there at the counter to take care of the customers waiting to pick up their lunches. Also, the usually add in bread with the takeout meal, which is good becuase the peanut sauce is a bit spicy, but not today. I guess it was just an off day for CPK.  But instead of spending $8 for a salad, I'll spend $10 and make 3 for the week. Sheesh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston?start=40
Ami R.,"Jersey City, NJ",9,87,52,1.0,9/28/2010,"This place has mice.  Need I say more??  Also, the waiters, host and managers all know this and yet, when you spot one during your dining experience, they all feign surprise.  Aw-hell no!!!  Next....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston?start=40
Charles K.,"Brighton, MA",3,31,19,3.0,12/16/2010,"First, people don't tend to go to CPK for real pizza, but rather the bizarre pizza concoctions that they have come up with. The servers tend to think that each person will order their own pizza, which is even more bizarre, given their unhealthy food. A pizza and an appetizer should be enough for two people. Be sure to check out the serving sizes, calorie counts and sodium levels for you go there. With that being said, the Pear and Gorgonzola pizza has an absolutely amazing taste when coupled with the wheat grain crust. I could live without the caramelized onions on it, but I really have no other qualms about this particular selection. Another notable pizza is the Jamaican Jerk Chicken pizza if you would like a spicy kick to your meal. When it comes to appetizers, I would definitely recommend the California Spring Rolls as they come with some pretty amazing dipping sauces.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston?start=40

MR ..,"Boston, MA",1,55,,2.0,10/29/2007,"i was there over the weekend for a lite lunch with a friend. The place was not very clean and the staff seemed like they were in another world and not really interested in working or helping customers. Nevertheless we were hungry and sat down for something to eat. It took a while for someone to show up and take our order. We ordered the following: chipolte chicken pizza, spinach dip, and shrimp and crab salad. All were pretty good and took care of our hunger. The food is not all that healthy so I am not sure when I will be back. The prices were ok, somewhat above average but what do u expect in the city?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-boston?start=40
