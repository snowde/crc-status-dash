Chris M.,"Boston, MA",0,19,10,2.0,1/12/2016,"I went here for a lunch with a party of 2 and we ordered 2 dishes to share. This was our third time here. Service was okay, we had to repeat our orders to the waiter a couple of times. However, he was very nice, so I'll give him a break. California cobb salad- This was okay. The salad came 5 minutes after we ordered it. There isn't dressing on the salad, but it comes with a side of blue cheese. The lettuce tasted kind of old, the other parts were just okay. I don't think I'd order it again. Garlic creme fettuccine- We got chicken with this, and I'd ordered it before on a previous visit. I liked this a lot, especially the chicken. However, it is a heavier lunch, because of the thick cream and whatnot.  We also tried some of their desserts. Wouldn't recommend. They didn't have a lot of choices, probably 6 things were available. Smores dessert- basically marshmallows and chocolate pudding. Not worth it. The marshmallows in the picture were melted but that wasn't the case on the real thing. The chocolate pudding was sickening sweet. My friend found a little plastic thing (almost like a wire?) in the pudding, and we told the waiter. The manager came over and apologized and took the item off the check.  Belgium chocolate souffle cake- The plate didn't look clean. That was the first thing I noticed. Around the edges, there were some stains. Ugh. The cake itself was not that great. It, again, was sickening sweet. We couldn't finish it.  Food here is below average. I'm not sure if I'll be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree?start=20
Jessica N.,"Quincy, MA",239,146,66,3.0,3/14/2015,"Unless you're going to CPK during dinner hours the place is pretty quite. One of my usual first places to visit once I am done with my shopping spree. Its located near the Nordstrom side of the mall and is actually quite clean and pleasant.  The servers are always extremely friendly as well as the hostess. There is a current promotion going on right now where they are offering dinner and movie tickets, worth a checkout .  I got the BBQ pizza, fish tacos, and pasta. All of which tasted pretty decent and the portions are huge!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree?start=20

Ashlee S.,"Milton, MA",0,32,91,2.0,5/7/2016,"Got the fried mac and cheese as a main entree with my boyfriend. We have gotten this before here and we loved it but this time, it was not that good. It was overcooked and the mac and cheese was very dry inside. The cheese sauce that is served with it is good, but there was not enough to help make this dish less dry. Disappointing meal here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree?start=20
J H.,"South Weymouth, MA",0,11,,1.0,12/15/2015,Worst service ever!!!! Do not go here if you want to eat or even get a drink.... we sat at our table for 20 minutes before someone came to get our drink order (I know my fault for not leaving)... so our order is in and we sit for 10 more minutes before we ask to move to a different section with a better server....

Melissa C.,"North Reading, MA",0,38,,4.0,4/19/2016,"Had a very quick wait before being seated. Got a white mushroom pizza and ordered the truffle oil for $1.50 though it didn't seem to make a difference to the pizza.

Victoria C.,"Weymouth, MA",0,39,,4.0,9/11/2016,My boyfriend and i visited for the first time today. Our server was friendly enough and we shared a small plate of guac nd chips. I ordered chicken piccata and he got some sort of veggie pizza. Both plates were pretty good. Overall the restaurant is pretty average for a chain place.

Francisca W.,"Boston, MA",128,470,1014,2.0,11/1/2014,"used to like this chain, a lot... ok maybe that was some 15 years ago, but always wanted to come back (and i had, few years back in the boston downtown location).  was utterly disappointed today and left with a grumpy husband. found the name being mentioned on the gluten-free app; convinced GF hub to try the place.  he might have been partial because he didn't particularly care for the mall, but here's what we think need serious attention from management: - came in on a Saturday around 3:30pm; greeted by a 15-minute wait while there were quite a handful of empty/just left tables waiting to be cleaned; - seats and plates were not entirely clean when we arrived at our booth (i.e. food crumbs left on them); - our server was split between waiting our table and manning the take-out counter, contributing to his inevitable absent-mindedness and non-appearance during our meal (ex. aforementioned plate was not replaced until reminded, after food has arrived -- and he didn't bring it to us); - food was grossly overpriced (ex. $9+ for a ""half"" salad; need to pay extra $3-4 for protein);  - our salad was missing ingredients -- we did not bother returning it bc we didn't want to wait another 20 minutes to have it remade.  besides, our waiter was busy manning the take-out counter; - we only ordered a pizza and a salad; the pizza somehow managed to come out way before the salad; - GF menu had 4 items on it -- though, the main menu lists quite a few things that ""contains GF ingredients"", which i suppose can accommodate special dietary needs.  but i wouldn't entirely trust that the staff knows what exactly to do for people with more severe allergies, especially at this point. in general, aside from them serving alcohol (which probably helps put customer complaints to a minimum), we don't understand why the place is slamming like it is.  it seems to look more like a circus (maybe a controlled chaos?) than a restaurant.  staff appears to be of a younger, eclectic crowd, which is totally fine otherwise, but based on service (or the lack thereof) that we have received and observed today, it appears that they either need more professional training, and/or a really good raise. i don't know... doesn't seem like the morale was low or that they don't care about their job, but...something seems very loose about the place. and i'd usually turn to management for all these unanswered questions. not necessarily the actual manager on duty (who seemed to be working quite hard), but more on the overall operation, leadership, and vision for this brand.  maybe they are successful in putting themselves on this ""fine casual dining"" map -- good for them -- but we do not intend to come back, due to all of the reasons above.  i wasn't as grumpy as hub, but i agree that this has ruined the brand for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree?start=20

Grace L.,"Braintree, MA",0,19,3,4.0,2/19/2016,"Not the best, but definitely worth a try. Their raspberry, strawberry, and regular lemonade are all to die for.  Portions are on the small side, but i don't mind since i never have a huge appetite anyway.  The best dish I've ever had from here was their four cheese ravioli but they discontinued it even though this was a lot of my friends' favorites as well! Hopefully they bring it back.

Nandanie S.,"Quincy, MA",418,523,355,4.0,3/5/2013,"Came here for dinner last night, and it was good. I had an all-time favorite - the Jamaican Jerk Pizza. It has everything I like, and it was tasty. I only had 3 pieces because it's super filling. I also tried the salted caramel pudding, which was odd to me at first because I never had salted caramel pudding before, but it warmed up to me. It's salted caramel pudding atop cookie crumbles, and then then this is topped with whipped cream that had salted caramel syrup drizzled on top. I scraped off the whip cream because I hate the stuff. It wasn't bad. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree?start=20

Jess A.,"Seekonk, MA",0,4,,1.0,12/17/2016,"Terrible experience. My family (2adults 2 kids)came here after a long flight as we headed home. My daughter in only 18months old and doesn't stay in restaurants long. Waiter-stephen- asked our order and our food came out pretty quickly. Pizza was ok. But that's where the good ends. Our waiter was at the hostess stand pretty much all night chatting with the hostess, we could see him from our seats....took a while to flag him down to get another round of drinks....to which he forgot one. Then we asked for boxes to take the pizza home, he brings out the wrong sizes....asked if we wanted dessert, we said no, we had to get little one to bed and will just take the check....he disappears to the hostess stand again. Then finally brings it over, I quickly put CC in it....he takes a long time getting back to the table to run the card. When he does, he then goes back to the hostess stand and starts dancing and celebrating something....then I see him run card and go BACK to the hostess stand. Not for nothing, but that was the last straw. We will not return here and do not recommend it to anyone who wants good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree?start=20

Courtney O.,"Foster City, CA",164,96,16,1.0,8/10/2016,"I normally love CPK, but I will not be back to this location after the way they handled a dining experience with myself & my friend. **DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES** During a dining experience with my friend, they served her a dish WITH nuts in it after she asked her server several times if it contained nuts. We could not believe that the server was unsure about whether or not a certain dish contained nuts. Luckily, she asked once more with the manager before consuming it and he then confirmed yes the dish had nuts, HOWEVER this did not happen until we had already ordered, waited for the food and it was sitting in front of her.  After we confirmed this, my friend was able to order something else that was confirmed to not have nuts in it and the dish was taken off the bill. Good, fine, great. Meal goes on and everything is fine. However, upon receiving the bill, we found that she had been charged for the new dish she ordered, which we were under the impression had been taken care of. I was blown away and could not get over how much their management did not understand the severity of the situation. In this case, the replacement dish my friend got SHOULD of been on the house regardless since they nearly served my friend a dish that could of sent her to the hospital.  After receiving my bill and informing the server that we disagreed with the bill and wanted my friend's entree comped (not the whole bill, just that one dish!) they looked at us like we were crazy and gave us major attitude back, stating, ""Well, we gave you the first dish for free..."" You mean you gave the dish that could of hospitalized because your server couldn't say for sure whether there were nuts in it or not? You're giving that for free now? My friend and I were absolutely shocked and immediately asked to speak to the server's manager.  Then, the manager came over and the same thing....""Well we comped your first dish for free, and we can take maybe $10 off."" Thank you CPK, I'm glad you care about your customer's safety and well-being so much! After more arguing, the manager FINALLY offered a free dessert as well to help fix the problem. At that point we were so done and wanted to leave the restaurant we accepted, ate the dessert as fast as possible and left.  Long story short, I will never be back and my friend is lodging a formal complaint with this location's CPK supervisor and I'm writing this lovely Yelp review about our absolutely horrible experience at this location.

Kat B.,"Dorchester, MA",541,57,213,4.0,3/11/2016,The staff at CPK were awesome. They were able to seat us where we wanted and accommodate us with a baby chair and room for our stroller. Mina was our server he was great! The food was awesome the only thing that was the issue everyone had there food but me mine came 20min after everyone else's. I ordered the garlic cream fettuccine pasta with chicken. It was delicious. The mango lemonade was very tasty as well. The baby seem to love her Mac and cheese as well. The kids ate up their BBQ chicken pizza and my mentor enjoyed her salad as well( they were really good with subbing out certain ingredients for her as well but the only thing that was wrong was instead of toasted almonds they put peanuts BUT the manager was great and made up it up to her) I would definitely go back and eat here with friends :) ------------------//-------///------ Came back again this time Delilah took care of us the food was DELICIOUS & she was a sweet heart everything was fabulous loved every thing. 2/16,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree

I personally prefer thin pizzas and not many places can make great flavorful thin crust pizza. Though this place does, in a brick oven! My favorite dishes so far are:  -White Corn Guacamole - if you're gonna share this with someone; good luck fighting over it! -Avocado Club Egg Rolls - These are delicious but pretty heavy on their own; I would never order this as an app with a pizza -Cobb Salad - If you're ordering a main dish as well; get the half salad because their full salads are huge!  -Thai Cruch Salad - Not too shabby  -Spinach Artichoke Pizza - In love!!

Amanda R.,"Easton, MA",245,149,798,3.0,12/5/2015,"I've honestly experienced better food elsewhere, sorry to say. I have had better pizzas, salads and pastas at other chain restaurants and local mom and pop restaurants. However, their appetizers and desserts are worth trying. Starters: Try the small plate of the Spicy Chicken Tinga Quesadillas.  The ranchito sauce that comes on the side is on the milder scale and pairs well. The quesadillas have cilantro, black beans, roasted peppers, lime chicken, Monterey Jack cheese and caramelized onions. Get this:  It's baked, not panini pressed! I tried the Sesame Chicken Ginger Dumplings two nights ago and wow, I wanted more! The secret's out...I really like dumplings and ginger and I'm glad those two go well together.  Soy-Ginger Chili sauce comes on the side with those lovely dumplings and it's big enough to share. If you're getting the lunch combo, add these to complete your meal...you won't go wrong.  Pizza: I tried the California Veggie pizza and was disappointed. The veggies were really dry and there wasn't enough sauce on the pizza. The sun-dried tomatoes aren't a nice touch either. To me, the crust on CPK'S pizzas is dry and tasteless. Salads: I can't do it! There are way to many toppings to sift through and I really couldn't enjoy my salad. I got the Thai Crunch Chicken Salad, but without avocado. There were more rice sticks than veggies. The highlight was the Thai peanut dressing and the edamame.  Pastas: I got the Garlic Cream Fettuccine with both chicken and shrimp. All that I tasted was cream. I had to add black pepper and salt to give it a pasta lift. Also, the dish was extremely oily.  Desserts: The Pumpkin Cheesecake was bitter and has way to many spices for a pumpkin cheesecake.  It gave me a headache and it's a humungous slice.  The praline sauce drizzled on top of it and at the bottom made it taste even worse. I have a fix for that.  Try the Butter Cake with or without ice cream, your choice!  You will really LOVE this dessert because it's sweet and not too heavy.  I get it all the time when I go.  Sorry CPK, I'll come back just for appetizers and for the Butter Cake dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree

We did let our server know and a manager did come by our table to apologize and took the price of the salad off our bill. That however is not the point! Cross contamination of meat is a risk for ethical and religious grounds. We were told that this occurred because the meats were placed alongside the salad ingredients for efficiency.

The drink i had, mango iced tea, very mango tasting...enough flavor. Then for entree I shared a roasteD Garlic CHicken pizza. The pizza def needs more chicken...kinda skimpy on it! But very very good. Add some pepper and cheese and you are good to go! The crust was not too thin or two thick, just the way i like it. i'm glad i was advised to just try it myself before i wrote this place off :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree?start=40
Tanya Y.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",344,200,547,4.0,11/15/2011,"There's something for everyone at California Pizza Kitchen, and was pleasantly surprised when they finally opened one up in the new expanded area of South Shore Mall. Almost anything beats eating in a mall food court, therefore I frequent CPK pretty often.  There has never been a line or a long wait to get a table, which is amazing.  The service hasn't disappointed me either; the glass was never empty with refills constantly coming,and I am greeted with a smile, every single time.   Their menu is updated pretty often to add ontop of their regular menu, which consists of small cravings, appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pizzas, and pastas.   Things worth trying?  Their spinach artichoke dip (comes with chips) is TO DIE FOR.  Creamy, cheesy, gooey - perfect in every way.  If it weren't so strange and I had this in my house, I'd like the bowl. Their pizzas are pretty good too, and large for an individual portion.  My favorite one used to be the Santa Fe Chicken Pizza [came with seasoned chicken, caramellized onions, salsa, and guacamole] until they took it off the menu [cry! T__T ].  You can add on or take out whatever you'd like from the pizzas and even change the crust [wheat, thin crust, etc], which is a plus. Their salads come in full and half portions. Most of the salads are available with chicken or shrimp on top for additional cost.  I love love the Waldorf Chicken Salad [field greens, chicken, granny smith apples, red grapes, celery, gorgonzola, with either blue cheese or balsalmic dressing] and find that the half portion gets me pretty full.   For those watching their weight or are concerned with what's going into their bodies, the nutritional information for everything on their menu is on their website.  For even more convenience, California Pizza Kitchen remains open on its own hours, independent of when the mall closes. Oh!  And their Cherry Limeade is delicious!  :3   Try it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree?start=40

As we walked in it was me, my daughter and 1 y/o grandson. They put us at a table right up from where the breeze from the mall entrance froze us (this was a 10 degree day). We asked if they could close the doors and was told that they were not allowed to. When we asked to move tables they grudgingly moved us 2 tables down. The waitress was good and the food was tasty, but it took almost 30 minutes for a pizza and salad. Once we finished it took 10 minutes to get our check and get out..

Matthew M.,"River North, Chicago, IL",10,2,,1.0,4/8/2014,"It was so bad I walked out. Expensive for average Italian classics with west coast twist. I ordered off small plates menu. Got the petite wedge salad, size might of been okay but the presentation was awful. Tomatoes not properly diced and only 1 strip of bacon in to 3 pieces.  I also got the spinach and mushroom flatbread, look good but way too small for $6. Looked like they used a breadstick as the base.  Although I get it, they were small plates. The service had no personality and asked if I wanted bread. I thought bread is standard when you sit down here.  I got the bread with the salad and the pizza at the same time. This is what I mean by no personality, instead of me asking for the salad first he could of been proactive and ask me if I wanted the salad before or all together.  CPK need a fresh start because they are overpriced and outdated, food may taste good but not good enough to be #1",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree?start=40

Lettuce in the salad was fresh and crisp, and topped with freshly shaved cheese and an average Caesar dressing. Would have been a good Caesar salad except for one thing: NO CROUTONS! Major oversight. Toppings on the pizza were good, but crust was a little underdone, doughy, and bland. Our server was very friendly, although I specifically had to flag her down and ask for a refill on mine and my wife's drinks despite two ""walk-bys"" with our empty glasses on the table. Christmas music playing on the background ""Muzak"" system was strange. I love Christmas as much as the next person. But I don't believe in playing Christmas music 2 weeks before Thanksgiving. Granted, it wasn't all Christmas music..just a couple songs in the overall mix..but still weird and way too early. The place is okay, but not great.

After telling the waiter multiple times to bring in more bread they finally bought out 3 plates for the party. After waiting for 30 more mins the main course started to come out one by one. Most of the folks ended up not enjoying what they ordered. The pizzas were every pale. I ordered a California club with chicken and Mediterranean salad with chicken topping. They bought out the sandwich with turkey. After I asked the waiter to check the order he insisted that the sandwich had chicken and bought out a piece of both meats to show me that both meats look the same.

The pepperoni pizzas from the kid's menu was just right for our boys. My husband and I ordered sandwiches. I liked that they came with soup or salad rather than fries.

Emily D.,"Quincy, MA",251,394,942,3.0,3/6/2012,"After a little shopping on the ""newer"" side of the mall.. we decided to stop and get something to eat. I was too lazy to walk to the other end of the mall.. luckily we noticed there was a CPK.  I have been to a CPK before.. once at Galleria Mall and Prudential. Both times were okay so I didn't expect anything different. We were seated fairly quickly.. the restaurant is large.. good for big groups but it's not as big as the Cheesecake factory. On the menu they have some new ""smaller plate"" items which are great if you're coming for apps and drinks. We were hungry!! So we ordered the ""small plate"" Mac n Cheese bites and Guacamole with chips. We also shared the Habanero Carnitas Pizza. The Mac n Cheese bites were bland but they were crispy. It needed more cheese. I really enjoyed my gauc with chips. But, if you're looking for a traditional guacamole.. this isn't it. This was pieces of avocado with black beans, corns, and peppers. I enjoyed it.. but the hubby hatessss beans. It's already prepared with the beans so it's not like you can have it without it. I thought the pizza had great flavor.. it's one of their newer items on the menu. But, it was bit chewy and I would've preferred it to be crispier. It came with a side of insanely spicy salsa. Seriously, the manager was walking around and she noticed we ordered this pizza and she asked if we'd tried the salsa yet. We had and our mouths were on fireee!! She said that for her it's too spicy also but other customers love it. The salsa did have great flavor but I couldn't have more than a drop on my pizza.  Truth is... I really came in here for the Red Velvet cake. I've had it before and I secretly just wanted to come here for the cake.

Once we sat down we waited even longer for a server to come and take our drink order. By the time Calli, our server even showed up, we knew what we wanted to drink and eat. My BBQ chicken pizza was Luke warm, the chicken was cold, and it seemed to have been cooked and then placed under heating lamps for quite some time, waiting for someone to come along and to order it. Calli walked past our table multiple times, ignoring us it seemed like. I had finished my water soon after we got our food, and put the glass at the edge of the table indicating that I needed more. Calli walking past it multiple times did not EVER offer to refill my glass. I had to finish my meal, with the only thing to drink was the ice I had to chew on.  When it came to the bill, which took a lifetime to receive, we had to make sure we received the right one! The table behind us received not only the wrong bill from Calli, but when Calli took it back to give the, the right bill, she said out loud, ""It does not make a difference if you get their bill or yours!"" I was appalled to hear that! Not only did she say it to the guests but she said it out loud in the middle of the restaurant!  This was my first and very last time ever at CPK.

Katie C.,"Boston, MA",180,587,92,4.0,6/25/2011,"I'm not typically a fan of reviewing chain restaurants since they are all pretty much the same - same menus, same layout, same service standards, etc.  However, after going to the CPK in the South Shore Plaza a few times, I figured it was time to review.  Contrary to popular belief, there is more than just pizza on their menu.  In fact, I have yet to try their pizza.   My fiance and I went here this evening after running a few errands in the mall, and we figured our past two experiences had went well, so we'd give it a try again.  We got there around 7:45 p.m. and were quoted with a 15 minute wait.  Okay, that's not bad for a Saturday night in the Plaza considering the Cheesecake Factory down the hall most likely had an hour wait, and that's on the conservative side. Once seated, we were promptly visited by our server and drinks hit the table less than two minutes later.  My better half ordered the Kung Pao chicken spaghetti dish, I ordered the barbecue chicken salad, and we decided to split the fried macaroni and cheese appetizer.   The appetizer was good, but not great.  Honestly, the fried macaroni and cheese from Trader Joe's was just as good, if not better.  But, it hit the spot and was perfect enough as an appetizer since it did not fill us up completely.  Next came the entrees!  The salad was served on an oval dinner plate which made it a little difficult to eat at first without it toppling over on the table.  It was like a Jenga game.  But, it was absolutely delicious and more than filling.  My fiance enjoyed the pasta dish, although he did mention that it could have been a little spicier and it did leave him wanting more as he did not find it completely filling (or, at least that's how he justified getting a piece of cheesecake to go from the Cheesecake Factory!) What really set this experience apart was our server.  Not only did she make excellent recommendations, she joked with us and genuinely wanted to make sure we were enjoying our meals.  The manager that stopped by our table to make sure we were enjoying ourselves even asked how the service was - A+ in our books!  In fact, in all our visits to the CPK, we've had service that has gone above and beyond what is typically expected, and that alone has made it a great dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree?start=60

Beth R.,"Boston, MA",158,393,111,4.0,5/26/2012,We love California Pizza Kitchen!  Their thin crust pizzas are delish...we've tried a good number of them.  I think it's safe to say that the Jerk Chicken is my fave & The Works is the husband's.  The small wedge salad is perfect for starters as are many of the apps to share.  The specialty drinks are yummy & odd fact to note: the bar is situated pretty much INSIDE the kitchen.  It trips me up everytime.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree?start=60
David D.,"Braintree, MA",0,9,,2.0,3/30/2011,"Having been to several other CPK's over the years I didn't have high expectations, and it pretty much delivered on that.  We were there on a Saturday afternoon and although it wasn't that busy service was slow and didn't look that interested in helping anyone out.  We ordered a couple of pizzas, peperoni and the classic bbq chicken.  The pizzas were OK, but not really inspiring.   I would rather go to a locally owned place that cares about its customers, this was just corporate food that really is over priced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree?start=60
S. W.,"New Haven, CT",0,13,,2.0,3/16/2014,"Food is great, when you get what you ordered.  Every single time I come here I get my order messed up.  Every time I have gotten take-out and forget to check to make sure it was correct, and got home and it was not what I ordered.  Every single time.  The reason I gave it 2 stars was because the food is delicious.  The manager is very accommodating but doesn't make up for the staff's lack of knowledge on how to make their food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree?start=60
Neric P.,"Quincy, MA",176,13,,5.0,12/1/2011,"I'm a frequent diner at this establishment and I figured it was about time to write a review.  CPK gives you quality food without breaking your wallet.  The one in Braintree is a very clean looking establishment with all of their employees looking like they enjoy working there.  It's more than just pizza, as they have good drinks, apps, salads and desserts.  I order their Waldorf Chicken Salad every time and I'm not even a fan of salads!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree?start=60
Dee L.,"Boston, MA",25,104,,4.0,2/16/2011,"Extensive menu, tons of salads, pizzas, sandwiches and meals. They have small plates mini apps. Really great idea. Came for lunch the place was empty don't get it Cheesecake is always mobbed maybe no one wants to walk down the other end of the mall. Well it's worth the walk! The server I wish I could remember her name was friendly, efficient and didn't try to rush 3 middle aged gals having a lesiurely lunch. We got the chicken avocado eggrolls - yum and 2 salads Thai Chicken and BBQ chicken, salads were huge! Will be back soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree?start=80
Phil W.,"Quincy, MA",8,27,6,3.0,11/7/2011,Ok we had take out from this place. My first time at CPK but it was a fund raiser for a church. Food was very good but very expensive for take out. and also for pizza. Probably go for eat in and not get pizza. What I paid for a nine inch pizza I could get probably just as good for a local place and a regualar very large pizza.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree?start=80
Betty B.,"BOSTON CLG, MA",0,23,,5.0,7/27/2014,"Went here for lunch on a Saturday.  No waiting, nice décor, restaurant not too crowded, not loud at all.  Got the small Cali Fields salad, one of if not the best salad I have ever had anywhere!  Only minor gripe is the pistachios are miniscule bits, thought they would be actual whole or half pistachios, could not taste them but again, salad was delicious!  We were also served bread, which was warm and delicious and was cut into small pieces which I loved cause I can really overdo it with bread.  Bread is served with very good oil, a little spoon would have been nice to serve it; no spoons to be had anywhere but no biggie, did not bother to ask for one.    Waitress was excellent, very patient and helped me figure out the nutritional info as the salad was new, on the menu but not on the nutritional menu yet.  All in all a really great meal, price was very reasonable; was pleasantly surprised at the food and service quality considering this was at the Braintree mall and I don't expect much from mall restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree?start=80
Michael K.,"Boston, MA",0,4,,4.0,11/24/2012,"A great choice for casual dining.  The chicken dishes are fantastic (e.g. piccata and creamy pesto) as are the appetizers.  The only improvement I would make is to offer a delicious basket of bread (a la Not Your Average Joes).  The prices are not bad, and so all in all, probably one of my top casual dining options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree?start=80
Chris B.,"Boston, MA",1,32,3,4.0,10/3/2011,Great experience. Great service from Zoe and wonderful food. The chicken Milanese is excellent. This particular location has wonderful decor.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree?start=80
Daddy G.,"Braintree, MA",0,9,,2.0,10/17/2011,"Food was just ok and the service was non-existent.  Now I remember why I haven't visited a CPK in more than two years.  The Braintree location is only a few months old, had only a few customers on a Monday at lunch time and still just a very long wait for a mediocre meal.  Don't waste your time or money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree?start=80
Laura R.,"Boston, MA",52,6,,1.0,4/10/2011,GROSS! just awful. How can you eat here a 2nd time? The ridiculously expensive pizza is tasteless and doughy. The only reason it gets one star is my cocktail was decent. Go to Bertuccis or Regina if you want chain pizza. At least it's good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree?start=80
Tom R.,"Canton, MA",2,14,,3.0,6/1/2011,"I have been going to CPK since the 90's.  First time was in a suburb of Chicago.  There are two things I love about CPK.  Their foccacia appetizer (regular or with cheese) and their shrimp scampi pizza.  Guess what?  This location does not have either of these.  Big time turn off.  The wait staff did not really know much as corporate I gather did not warn them that they were doing something different which is a shame.  So, they offered a wedge salad for $4.29.  For the size of what came, it should have been $3.00 and not a penny more.  It was very small but at least the lettuce was crisp and the egg, bleu cheese, tomatoes and bacon were good.  The prices for the wine made me gag.  They have a half glass price, full glass price and then the bottle.  Better to just drink some wine at home than pay the prices they want for their half glass of wine.  We then had the signature barbecue pizza with smoked applewood bacon and the all meat pizza (sausage, ham, capicola, pepperoni and probably one more I am missing).  The pizzas came and looked fantastic BUT, the barbecue chicken was missing the bacon.  Not the end of the world as it was still delicious, just not as delicious as it could have been.  The all meat was in place of the shrimp scampi pizza and very good however it could not replace the shrimp scampi.  The waitress we had was very good and pleasant so no issues at all with how served, in fact, this was the best part.  The food we received was also good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-braintree?start=80
