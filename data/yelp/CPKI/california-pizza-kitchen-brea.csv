Tiffany N.,"Arcadia, CA",653,476,692,5.0,1/4/2018,"I absolutely love their spinach artichoke dip! It is one of the most delicious things I've ever tasted. I cannot dine in at a CPK without ordering their spinach artichoke dip ($11.69). Another item I always have to order is their signature BBQ chicken pizza ($15.49). We also ordered their Garlic cream with Chicken pasta ($16.79) and it was so creamy and delicious! As soon as my boyfriend and I sat down, it got really busy so our server wasn't able to come to our table as often as we'd like. Ip did apologize and we were totally fine with it. We still got our fresh bread from Jeff (whom I believe is the manager)! He was able to help Ip out by refilling our waters and getting us cheese and pepper flakes! We had a wonderful lunch dining at CPK and I appreciate how consistent every CPK is with their ingredients. Their BBQ chicken pizza has tasted the same since I first tried it when I was in elementary school! The employees seemed understaffed but were so professional and kept their composure throughout. I applaud them for it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea
Jasmine J.,"Los Angeles, CA",343,262,1357,1.0,11/21/2017,"No wonder this place has such a low rating on yelp. The African American woman at the take out counter didn't want to come out to deliver my order, so I went inside. Then she gave me the wrong salad. We got a roasted vegetable salad with salmon on top, she gave me a bowl of raw lettuces with several super dry salmon cubes on top, and charged me $21.69 for it.  Don't come to this CPK, the food court inside of the mall is probably a much better choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea
Ashlyn O.,"Paradise Valley Village, Phoenix, AZ",68,63,5,1.0,11/16/2017,"I've been to several CPKs and this one was by far the worst. The food was the same as it is at any location, but the ambiance and service was awful. My husband and I got to the location after my friends had been seated. There were 4 of us all together and we only got 2 menus at the table despite them being aware that we would be joining a couple minutes after they were seated. When we asked for more menus they looked panicked and must have forgotten or not had any more because they didn't bring menus or mention it when they came back to take our orders. We put in our orders and the food came eventually, but they forgot my husband's order so that took another 15 minutes and I let him eat some of my food while he waited. When his food finally came out it was great. I was downing water so I had to run to the restroom a couple times and each time I went in the bathroom was a mess and there was a group of drunk girls in front of the mirror. The first time it was funny watching them stumble around like idiots, but after the 3rd time I got run into while standing at the sink washing my hands. At that point the drunk girls were wasted and started getting aggressive with myself and the other patrons. It was clear this restaurant overserved that group several drinks too many. When I came back and we got our check, I thought we made it clear earlier that the check was being split for the two couples so we could get our own CPK card points, but apparently it wasn't so I asked for it when the bill came as one. They said they couldn't split it on the paper check but could take both cards and do it manually in the system, so we handed over our cards. When the bill came back I was given the wrong credit card so they grabbed it from me and after 10 minutes gave me my card back. I had a feeling they messed something up so I checked my bank account and it turns out they charged me $100 for someone else's meal in addition to the $30 meal we ate. I saw the reversal pending on my account, but it was a weekend so I knew it was going to take a couple of days to get that money back whether I complained or not so I just didn't leave a tip (which I never do) and got out of there as quickly as I could. The money is back now, but the memory of that experience has destroyed my view of CPK. I have a feeling the attitude and lack of service might just be this mall. It was packed and parking was a nightmare. It felt like black Friday or Christmas Eve with how pushy and rude people were acting. Whatever it was, I don't plan on going back to that CPK or mall again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea
Kari T.,"Los Angeles, CA",433,436,335,3.0,10/17/2017,CPK is okay. Their pizzas are over priced for me and the pastas are whatever. What makes me coming back for more is their butter cake!!! Who doesn't love butter cake? Comes with ice cream and whipped cream :)  Service here was attentive and the waiter was really nice and even brought out lemons with our water. I'll away order butter cake here. Comes out warm and is a perfect combo with the cold ice cream,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea
Rebecca W.,"Rowland Heights, CA",329,227,434,4.0,7/15/2017,"Food: Huge fan of the avocado egg roll. It's fried perfectly with bits of bacon, avocado, etc in it.  Come with thousand island and ranch dips. BBQ Chicken pizza and Carne Asada pizza was delicious as well.  Service was ok. Took a while for us to get our water refills. Also, our server seem so tired of his job. Caught him multiple time smiling to us as we talk but once he moves away, the smile drops faster than the speed of light. He just seemed done. Right when we got our pizza and started eating, our bill was given to us immediately. Almost felt like we were being told to get out asap (maybe they have to give you your bill asap? Not sure...). Overall, I love the food here and it's worth going to. Service is a hit or miss though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea
Rachel T.,"Irvine, CA",67,969,239,4.0,9/28/2017,"I don't know what blew me away, the great food or the excellent customer service we received from Annie Jo! I haven't been to this location in years, I stopped going because of the bad service LOL, recently my sister reintroduced us back to CPK (the Irvine location) and we were hooked! It started with the small bites and bread and then it turned into a love fest of all their yummy food!! My sister has their app on her phone and it makes it so easy to place your order and customize from beginning to end! If your like me and prefer extra sauce and cheese this makes it easy to get what you really want and leave off what you don't want LOL! We already know the pizza is solid but their other entrees are delicious! I enjoyed the spaghetti bologense along with my fried mac and cheese bites! My sister came over last week and we figuring out what we wanted for dinner since we were in the area and I'm really glad we decided to give this location another chance! Even though we a did a to-go order the wonderful Annie Jo made us feel like VIPs! She was running the pick up order station and was on point! When we asked for extra bread and ranch she delivered! Nor did she have an attitude unlike most people when you ask for extras or charge you for them! Every step of the way she had a great attitude! At the last minute I decided to get one of their drinks to go and she didn't skip a beat, gave us a smile and it was ready in two seconds! She made sure we had all of our food and extras, she gave us so many olive oil, utensils and napkins! I only hope the rest of the staff takes a lesson on how to give green customer service like Annie Jo does! She is so friendly and inviting, making you feel valued as a customer! We were so enthralled with her great customer service we even called later that same night even though they had closed the manager answered the phone and was happy to hear about our great service! I hope Annie Jo gets the props and recognition she deserves! ^___^",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea

Pryscilla T.,"Westminster, CA",294,170,365,3.0,8/12/2017,"Came here for dinner. The food was great but service was lacking. Food/Drinks: Good - Ordered the Spinach Dip, BBQ Chicken Pizza, Hawaiian Pizza, Kung Pao Noodles, and Chicken Tequila Fettuccine. - I have to say the pastas stole the show on this one. My favorite pasta was the Kung Pao. It was sweet and slightly spicy after you have a lot. I really enjoyed it. - I had a small taste of the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine and remember it tasting good but can't recall the flavoring on this one - The two pizzas were mediocre and didn't really stand out. The Hawaiian Pizza was primarily dough and you couldn't taste the flavors of the pineapple and ham.  - The BBQ Chicken Pizza let you taste the sauce and was good but I preferred the noodles - Also ordered the Strawberry and Lime Cooler, de-li-cious. It was sweet and tangy, but after one it got slightly too sweet for me. Seating/Parking/Service: Decent - Tons of parking since it's located at Brea Mall - We didn't have a hard time finding a table for a party of 7 - Our waitress was kind and patient with helping us find something to eat - I could tell the servers, who brought the food out were ready to leave for the day since they would just drop off the food without bringing utensils, plates, or napkins.  Overall, I liked the food here and would recommend getting the pastas over the pizza but this wouldn't be a go to place for me unless I'm already at the mall and hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea
Kat G.,"Orange, CA",3,43,13,5.0,8/10/2017,"My husband hadn't eaten at a CPK in years, and our visit to this location in Brea in June was the first time we'd ever eaten at CPK together. We weren't expecting much -- maybe mediocre food and service -- but it exceeded our expectations. We were seated right away, and the manager Jeff introduced several of the new menu items to us. He really wanted us to try something new, so he had a server bring us the spicy buffalo cauliflower appetizer -- free of charge! It was surprisingly really tasty. My husband said he would definitely eat that again. We ordered pizzas for our meal, and they were delicious as always. I love their pizza dough. Our server checked on us several times to see how we were doing, and we got some drink refills as well. It was a nice experience eating here. So nice that I'd likely eat here again in the near future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea
Tom I.,"Placentia, CA",230,184,246,5.0,1/7/2017,"Introduction: I would say that I come to this CPK location at least once a week. Always get consistent great food and service. Being served by Scott for the second time is what prompted me to type them this updated review. Quality: 5/5 The quality of the food is always consistently amazing! We got the Wedge Salad with Ranch dressing vs blue cheese and BBQ Chicken Pizza with bacon and garlic, well done with extra cilantros and red onions.  Both came out perfectly and equally outstanding.  5 stars all the way! Quantity: 5/5 The portions were super generous, we barely finished them, so definitely enough for two. Especially when it comes with free courtesy breads.  We prefer eating the bread with butter vs the free oil dipping sauce.  Customer Service: 5/5 As previously mentioned above, we were serviced by Scott twice and today was no exception. Scott was on point, I was blown away by how many tables he covered and was still amazing.  I hope I get him every time, talking about amazing service!  Cleanliness: 5/5 Of course 5 stars, this place is nothing other than immaculate. So clean you can eat off the table if you drop something.  Price: 5/5 If you get great service and and great food, which we did, nothing is too expensive at that point. Miscellaneous: I can't say about other CPK's, but if you haven't tried the one in Brea, I highly recommend it.  Especially served by the one and only Scott.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea

Belle B.,"Walnut, CA",155,914,12849,1.0,3/6/2017,"When the kids love CPK and it's their birthday, you take them to CPK. Yes, it's a chain restaurant so you generally don't expect too much. What I did not expect was to spend 2 hour at the restaurant for this meal. No, it's not because we were having so much fun. It was because our server Israel was the worst. We sat at the tail end of the lunch rush on a Sunday. At that point, the restaurant was only 3/4 full. 40 minutes to order and get drinks. Good luck with refills. I would have had better luck walking to the food court and buying drinks for the table. 40 minutes to get our food, then the waiter wants to argue about what we ordered. We ALWAYS get exactly the same thing (come on, you know how it is with kids) so don't argue that we ordered something different. Even if we did, where is your customer service?? Then Israel disappeared never to be heard from again. Just kidding. He did not come back to check on the table or offer drink refills (The kids were thirsty). Another 40ish minutes to get the check. Really? Do you know how difficult it is to keep a 7yo and two 5 yos content for that length of time in a restaurant?? We were so frustrated, we didn't even order a dessert for the birthday kids. We just wanted out of there. Waiting, waiting, waiting, We put the credit card away and paid cash. We couldn't wait any longer. We had to walk up to the bar to get take-out containers for our food.  As we were getting up from the table to leave, suddenly Israel appeared. I'm sure he wanted to make sure we paid. I let him know we were disappointed with the service. It was the worst service we have had at this type of restaurant. He just started blankly. No apology. Nothing. Not seeing a manager around, I went and complained to the hostesses. They apologized and said they would inform the manager. I heard Israel tell a different table he was ""slammed."" Umm, sure. The restaurant was not even half full at that point. Since I did not get to speak to a manager, I contacted corporate. I received an email stating someone would get back to me within the next few days. Good thing I didn't hold my breath. It's been 4 weeks now. I waited to write this review, giving them the benefit of the doubt that it would be resolved. Obviously CPK does not care about customer service. Thanks, but no thanks.  If you come to this location, make sure you are not seated in Israel's section. God forbid you have an issue. Management won't help you out either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea

It was creamy and flavorful. CHICKEN TEQUILA FETTUCINE, -The best dish of tonight. It tasted kind of like Thai Food, a little sour and spicy.

We were so hungry we sat down and gave the pager back to hostess. Took about 5 mins for bartender to acknowledge us and she said to give her a minute. She then took about 5 minutes to make 1 drink then took that persons order and walked away. We sat there about 15 minutes with not even a glass of water, bar flies buzzing around in our faces.

MAGGIE K.,"Anaheim, CA",37,20,15,1.0,10/20/2016,"We usually love CPK, so this is difficult to write this 1-star review, but write it I must. The main problem we had at this Brea location was the poor service (never actually received our meal, so I can't comment much on the food). We should've learned our lesson from a previous visit, in which the manager profusely apologized for poor service and gave us coupons for free entrees on a future visit. Since there were many months in between these two visits, we still had hopes for a decent experience, but we will not EVER be back to this location.  We were there for lunch on a Wednesday, arriving around 12:40 pm. We were seated promptly in the remodeled SUPER-NOISY barn of a dining room. That right there cast a pall on the visit, as my husband and I had to shout to be heard over the din. I realize hard surfaces are easy to clean, but they don't make for a good conversational atmosphere. Obviously a big reason for the remodel was so they could cram more seating in there. Looks like the service hasn't caught up with the bigger capacity.  It took at least 15 minutes for anyone to stop by our table and acknowledge us, not even a glass of water. That should've tipped us off. Finally a waitress apologized and took our drink and food order. Husband's drink came out, but not my San Pellegrino. We both ordered soup and salads. 5-10  minutes later my soup arrives, but not hubby's soup or my drink yet (WTH?). I'm feeling rude as I apologetically begin eating, as the soup is already not as hot as it should be. My drink arrived about 5 minutes after my soup. We waited another 10-15 minutes or so, with no additional food in sight, no one checking in, and finally got disgusted and left (we left $20 on the table, which was $20 more than the experience was worth). UNACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF SERVICE!!! 40 minutes without food is just too long. SOME SERIOUS SERVICE and MANAGEMENT ISSUES at Brea CPK. Guess I'll learn to make that salad at home.

Of course, the pizza is good but they've got lots of delicious-sounding options on the menu. The Quinoa + Arugula Salad with house-made champagne vinaigrette made me drool a little. Maybe the Hearth-Roasted Halibut on a cedar plank with butternut squash farro? I couldn't order something that required googling the side dish, haha. It sounds delicious though.  We ended up with the roasted garlic chicken (whole wheat crust) and roasted artichoke and spinach pizzas (thin crust w/chicken added for $2). My thin crust pizza was great, crispy and cheesy. The crust on the garlic chicken pizza was a little but sweet, and chewy. I thought that the wilted scallions and gorgonzola went well with the chicken and garlic, it was yummy.

It was more of a crumbly texture, like corn bread. I hate corn bread! It was not like cake at all.  ;(  The pizza was pretty good. I got the California veggie. The Sesame Chicken Salad is my favorite, but since I don't care for meat, I take out most of the chicken. I should ask if they could give me more salad if I ask to leave out the chicken.  They used to serve a brownie sundae a while back but I am not sure they have that anymore. Now I am not sure if every location is the same but I was at The Spectrum location and the server encouraged me to order a NEW dish that I haven't tried, saying that if I don't like it, they'll take back and bring back a dish that I normally buy. Just throwing it out there.  Thanks for reading! ~*Kenzie*~ P.S. You can also order online and pick up at the restaurant. They normally reserve a couple of parking spots for pick-up. And PLEASE please tip, even though you are just picking up. The person who does phone orders, only does that. They package everything up and make sure you got everything. They don't get paid much.

Their menu is easier to follow and it takes you directly to other plates rather than just their pizzas.  I had the chicken piccata today and I loved it.  It was delicious.  I really recommend it.  The lemonade was too sweet so that's minus one star.

The floors were dirty and that was the 1st thing I noticed. We ordered an appetizer, a pizza, a salad and a pasta dish to share. We got our appetizer pretty quickly, but when our server brought our plates they were unwashed and had food stuck to them. ewwww. The 2nd set of plates we got had residue water mark from the dish detergent, and I had to use my napkin to clean them myself. It's disturbing.  Our meat craver pizza was pretty tasty but the pasta we got had some undercooked shrimps in there, not a fan of raw seafood unless it's at a reputable sushi place. Then we ordered the brownie dessert and the brownie was dry, powdery and hard: tasted like it was frozen and reheated in the microwave. Yuck!

At other location such as Huntington Beach or Victoria Garden mall don't charge you ridiculous price for a substitute salad with the rib eye dish. I could not eat angular salad and asked for green or house salad instead, some guy came out and said will be extra $3 which is so awful. Other location just give it for free. It is not like the salad come with is big, it is just really small and vegetable is very cheap. I have to pay almost $27 for rib eye steak and they charge me more for that.

Merlin C.,"Los Angeles, CA",40,36,32,2.0,5/11/2015,"I do not get this place.  I do not get it at all. I've eaten at CPK's maybe 2-3 times prior, and never liked it. We came to Brea mall on Saturday to get some late mother's day shopping in. We were hungry and couldn't decide what to eat on, but we happened to park at the entrance where CPK is located on.  Against my past experiences, I gave it another chance. So I'll start with the food.  I got a pepperoni pizza.  It was pretty decent, but to be fair it's kinda hard to screw up a pepperoni pizza.  Girlfriend got a green pasta thing, forgot what it was called.  It was pretty good, but be warned I've been told it makes your poop green.  So you just kinda gotta weigh that out if it's worth it. Now, this dining experience adding into my previous CPK experiences pretty much solidifies that I will never eat at CPK again. We got seated like right in front of a huge elementary school party.  At one point, all we could hear is 25 kids yelling ""CHEEESE CHEEESE"" for 5 minutes straight to take a picture.  There were like 15 kids in front of our table playing with balloons like volleyballs.  At one point, a few of them decided they wanted to play with us (we didn't want to play) and we got balloons thrown at us repeatedly. Not only was this a huge annoyance, but this is also dangerous - common sense where there is hot food being moved around is not a good place for kids to be running around.   Disappointed the parents didn't keep the children under controlled but even more disappointed because CPK should have said something.  I saw one kid fall.  I saw one girl almost hit her head on the corner of a table. No place that allows this kind of behavior should have steaks on their menu.  CPK is like Chucky Cheese's pseudo-classy, lame cousin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea?start=120

The girls didn't get learn anything about owning a business, or how long you been established, how many pizza you make in a day. They gave us dough and left us alone at the table for over 20mins. We have been on other tours from other restaurants and they were AMAZING! This was an awful experience for the girls. We never saw the manager or owner. We had to pay $10 per girl. The Girl Scouts is a nonprofit organization.... I was disgusted by the lack of cleanliness of the kitchen. There was raw chicken and Shrimp left out defrosting in a tub on the floor. We had to walk on the wet slippery floor with dirty dishes everywhere. I mean Really!!! They didn't even seem like they to care that 15 little girls and there moms were coming to visit their restaurant that day. It looked like nobody even cleaned up from the night before, that's a health violation for sure. I will not go back to that restaurant or any other CPK ever again because of the uncleanliness of your establishment. I felt like we should have got a better tour or even apology from the manager. I've called the manager a few times and he doesn't even seem to care. I'm sorry I wish I had better things to say about my experience at CPK. I've called corporate a few times and left messages, I've Instagram, twitter, and facebook and I've got no reply back from anyone.

The bread was probably the worst part of the meal since it was a little tough to chew, but the rest was perfect. From my yummy strawberry lemonade to their incredibly delicious Kung Pao Spaghetti (a must try!). Everything tasted great.

I wanted to get food fast and go my way. Apparently taking a bigger order over the phone is their priority rather than the guest sitting at the bar.  I was really disappointed by waiting 25 minutes for my appetizer to come in and obviously waiting that long there is no more appetite for entrée. They are busy over the phone I understand, but common pay attention to the customers that are at the restaurant as well.

We asked for bread 5 times and never received it. He even told us it was still baking when we noticed the two tables next to us all received hot bread.  When we asked him to check on the food we waited almost an hour for he said it was still cooking.  When the food finally came it was cold and the kids' pastas were hard and dry. We always order the chicken piccata and every other time lately it's not made to taste correctly. Today it was so cold AND THE ANGEL HAIR WAS AGAIN BOILED IN A CLUMP!   IT was so unsatisfying; It's definitely not worth $16.99.    We waited so long we ate what we got and hurried home to get the kids to bed but we are sick of having to complain to management.

Jon B.,"Irvine, CA",678,860,3629,3.0,3/24/2011,"My favorite parking spot when we come to Brea mall is always the CPK side. Always walking by here but never cared to dine in. I been going to CPK for years at other locations, but as much as I've come to shop this mall we finally paid a visit here about a week ago. It was a Sunday morning after church and a visit from the Apple store we went in for brunch, the place was wasn't busy at all and we got seated at one of the booths very quickly and I was like f*** yea!!! my stomach was growling like crazy since mass ( excuse my Language I just left church )  So we got our menus and my mindset was to get a pizza, and for the track record CPK is known for good small hand tossed pizzas. My stomach was telling me to get the Buffalo chicken pizza BTW something caught my attention I noticed there were calorie counts labeled on every food in the menu and that buffalo chicken pizza was worth about 1400 calories!!! Whaaaaaaaaaat!?!?! Tha F************k !!!!!! for a small pizza?  I'm watching my calories so no more bloats... I don't know when the last time I had CPK but seeing calories counts for something I want to eat makes me go hands off easily, but this is new to me seeing that here and this place threw me off by surprise but hey I can't complain it's all about ""Stay healthy America"" I ordered the California Club pizza topped with grilled chicken, avocados,  tomatoes, lettuce, mozzarella cheese and applewood smoked bacon. It's a few hundred calories less than the Buffalo chicken pizza but it will do.  The pizza was pretty good it's light and hearty, you can add some ranch sauce on your thin crust pie, overall not bad.  To me the Cali pizza was like chicken salad on toast bread.

They also use the GIG standards, which is rare to find and very impressive. The service here is excellent and the wait time is usually not too long.

Anyways, this place completely changed my opinion on it. I had the Jambalian pasta and shared it with my boyfriend (btw it's not that big so I don't recommend sharing) and we also had the spinach dip appetizer with pita bread. The service was fast, we got seated immediately, and service was friendly. My only complaint is the price and the dessert; just for what it was, definitely wasn't worth the price, but whatever. Also, the dessert menu was non existent... They had 4 things to choose from and for me, they were all things you'd leave on a platter at parties because nobody wants them. It was pudding and 3 other things, and also, I don't want to pay $10 for pudding that I can make at home for $1.25. At least add ice cream to the menu, I didn't get anything for dessert it all looked really in unappealing.

Last night, my husband and I ate dinner here and ordered the Spicy Buffalo Cauliflower. When it arrived, it's obviously different from what we used to order in other CPK locations, in terms of the serving size, it's as if they chopped a 2 big cauliflower and just spread it out. Asked our server and she was clueless about the real serving size. A manager came over and talked to us, I even showed him the picture that I took and posted on my Facebook account, on how different it was in terms of the serving size. I even compared it to the picture that they have displayed on their table (they're promoting it because it's new). He said that he'll talk to their chef, BUT didn't do anything about our order. We were truly disappointed, left without any explanation why is their Spicy Buffalo Cauliflower different from the rest of other CPK branches.

They also serve bread with olive oil now like other authentic Italian restaurants, it used to be just regular bread and butter. Food is pretty good, if you don't order anything other than pizza. I love their Hawaiian BBQ chicken pizza. The spaghetti bolognese is pretty bad here compare to BJs, Bucca, Olive Garden, Cheesecake Factory and etc,. I would just stick to their pizza next time. The price they charge is also very reasonable, it's not a bad place to visit from time to time. The parking is pretty bad if you come during weekend mall opening hours.

My waiter had approx 5-6 tables.  He was unable to handle that light load.  I waited over 5 mins to place a drink order.  Easily waited over 5 mins for the drinks to be brought out.  Then waited an additional 15-20 mins to place the food order and receive the complimentary bread.  Every time I tried to flag him down, he'd say, ""I'll be right there."" but never came to the table.  This went on over and over.  INCOMPETENCE.   A full kitchen of cooks, but food easily took almost 30 mins to come out to the table.  Taste and quality of food?  Horrible.  INCOMPETENCE. As my table is eating, other tables finished their meals and started leaving.  The busboy was nowhere to be seen.  My table was surrounded by 8-9 empty tables piled with dirty plates.  As I was paying the check, the busboy finally came out and started to bus the tables.  INCOMPETENCE. The manager should know when a waiter or busboy is falling behind and failing.  He should then step in and assist as needed.  This guy deemed himself above doing any menial work and just strolled through the place doing nothing.  INCOMPETENCE. This place is overrated and overpriced.  The quality and flavor of food is laughable.  My table didn't touch one of the pizzas because it was just horrible.  Rest of the food was mediocre at best.   This is why my previous visit to CPK was well over 10 years ago.  I was forced to go by members in my party, and honestly I was curious how the food was now.  This visit once again reaffirmed CPK is overrated and overpriced.  I do know that I will never again spend my money at CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea?start=180

We asked for bread 5 times and never received it. He even told us it was still baking when we noticed the two tables next to us all received hot bread.  When we asked him to check on the food we waited almost an hour for he said it was still cooking.  When the food finally came it was cold and the kids' pastas were hard and dry. We always order the chicken piccata and every other time lately it's not made to taste correctly. Today it was so cold AND THE ANGEL HAIR WAS AGAIN BOILED IN A CLUMP!   IT was so unsatisfying; It's definitely not worth $16.99.    We waited so long we ate what we got and hurried home to get the kids to bed but we are sick of having to complain to management.

They also have free bread while you wait for your order!  Their pizzas are great, thin crust and quite filling for a person, that I usually have to take home. Their salads are great too. The right ratio of dressing to the salad. My only complaint is that the roasted garlic chicken pizza that I have come to love and frequently come to order does not exist! Even when it was on the menu, they ran out of the sauce! Completely unacceptable,  especially when there were three days left for it to be on the menu. That pizza will forever be missed.

Very witty and so funny she had my cousin and I laughing out loud. She was very attentive. No complaints there. Besides her being amazing, our salads were delicious, tasty, fresh, and we didn't have to wait very long. The only downer was when the bill came. Who knew just ordering 3 glasses of wine, 2 salads, and a Lettuce Wrap Appetizer would come out to over $65.00?! What? INSANELY OVERPRICED for the portions you get.  I was very specific about which wine I wanted, but I guess you have to specify if you want the $7.00 glass or the $9.00 glass. Obviously, our server took it upon herself to bring us the ""pricier"" glasses of wine. Pretty slick, Jill. But that was my bad.  And because she had such a great personality, we overlooked it, and still tipped her very well. If only alot of servers out there realized, if you have a killer personality and great attitude, it's amazing what customers will overlook. (wink).  Would I eat here again?

I don't want to bore with a long review about a place you are familiar with so here is the skinny... This place gets packed but to my wonderful surprise we were seated within 15 mins when we were told 25! That was my first surprise. The second, and way better, was the change in the comp bread. They switched from kinda dry French and butter to a fresh delightfully crispy on the outside soft and yummy goodness on the in. Also instead of butter they now give olive oil with herbs. Funny how a little change like that can really revitalize the meal! We ordered two house salads and shared the spinach artichoke thin crust pizza. The salad was plain but good. If you don't like your salad drowned with dressing than this is the salsas for you. Mixed greens, tomato, croutons and light ranch. Next was the cheesy, garlicky, spinachy, artichokey, crispity crunchy goodness!! If that doesn't sum it up I don't know what will. This was one of the best CPK pizzas I've had to date. Service was great. I'm always a sucker for a real, not overly nice server and Sabrina was her! She was super fast, friendly and accurate. She kept my wine glass full so that is always a plus.

There other salads are good too, but I always order the BBQ chicken. There pastas are okay, but this is really not the place for pastas. Another dish I love is there Tiramisu!!

The ambiance is nice, with dim lighting, great for casual dining after shopping or night out with friends.  We received okay service, our waitress wasn't very prompt, but not to the point where it got annoying.  I ordered the usual, bbq chicken pizza and my friend ordered the california club pizza. The bbq chicken pizza was delicious, as usual. Who knew bbq sauce would taste so good on a pizza? The chicken was very moist and flavorful.  As for the california club, it's a very unique presentation. It literally looks like  caesar salad on top of pizza dough, with slices of avocado going around the pizza.

For some reason every time I go to cpk I always order the Sicilian even if I don't eat it. Cpk use to have a tower of bread and butter which was perfect but now they have traded it up for a few chucks of bread and some olive oil and   Vinegar. Horrible.  Service.  The service is great.

Comes out warm & toasty, with a nice herb/Olive oil for dipping instead of butter like in the past. I most definitely love the healthier ingredients including more enriching greens in their CA Club Pizza. CPK doesn't normally pop up in my head when deciding on places to eat, but I can say that now it will. I also love their BBQ chicken salad with the perfect crunch of julienne jicama.. Yum! It comes pre-tossed with dressing. I normally don't like it that way because I feel like salads at all restaurants are just overly drenched with it. Luckily, my salad came out with the perfect amount; just right. Service is decent... Not spectacular but not horrible either.

He mentioned that he went to the back of the kitchen to make sure that they got the order, but the pizza still came out funky.  I gave that 1/2 Roasted Artichoke and Spinach with Pineapple a try. The first slice was sweet combination, but the second slice didn't kick up the taste buds as much so I stopped eating and waited for my Hawaiian BBQ Chicken.

When I told her my party was here she basically shrugged her shoulders and said ""I can't keep another party waiting"". Well, what was I doing, I believe I was waiting too?   I asked to speak to the manager but apparently there wasn't one available, only a kitchen manager, Christian, who at least was respectful and was listening to our complaint.  As my friend and I were expressing our concern to him, SARA was shaking her head and rolling her eyes.  She was even laughing for a moment after whispering to another employee.  My friend told SARA that this was not a laughing matter.  SARA's response was ""How do you know we're even laughing at you?""      To the CPK manager in Brea....you need to rethink who you put at the front hostess area.  These people are the first employees that your customers are in contact with.  SARA not only needs an adjustment in her attitude but she also needs to know how to approach customers in situations like these.  If she would have come to me and tell me, ""I'm sorry but if your party doesn't get here in 5 minutes I will have to give your table away"".  That I could understand.  But to just give our table away after I've been waiting and then speaks to us in a disrespectful tone if front of the children?   SARA does not have the customer service skills or did not receive the correct training in handling a large party.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea?start=220

Tuscan hummus, Feta cheese topped with extra virgin olive oil and a Greek salad with cucumbers, red onions, fresh Roma tomatoes and Greek olives in a homemade lemon-herb vinaigrette served with pizza-pita bread. I also ordered my favorite beverage here the Cherry limeade - it's so yummy!  For main entrees I ordered the Thai Chicken Linguine - spicy Thai peanut-ginger sauce with julienne carrots, green onions, cilantro and roasted peanuts and topped with fresh bean sprouts. This was very tasty but it was a little rich and heavy. In addition, we ordered Chipotle Chicken Pizza - This was so tasty - contained grilled chipotle chicken, fire-roasted mild chilies, chipotle sauce, Mozzarella and Enchilado cheeses. Topped with roasted corn & black bean salsa, cilantro and lime cream sauce.  For desserts to go - Strawberry Cheesecake and a piece of Tiramisu. I was full so I only tried a couple of bites that evening of the cheesecake and then polished off both the next evening. Both were very good but I enjoyed the strawberry cheesecake over tiramisu.

Now, they've put on some big boy pants and now the bread thickness is about double to triple what is was before, they dropped the butter and serve it now with a side of olive oil and seasoning. Pretty sure you can get butter still if you ask, as they still give you the olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The server was attentive, and even when he was busy there was always someone who came by and asked if we were okay. Once we were finished our waiter delivered our check and even started clearing some of the plates. Glad to still see mid priced restaurants with old fashioned hospitality, and not just leave all the plates until you leave.

I tried to use it again today at Anaheim and they told us sorry it has $0 on all 3 cards. WTF!?!? We were LIVID. So I called Brea CPK (where it was bought) and got a hold of Jeff, the nicest manager you will ever meet in your life!!!! He was so understanding and just as frustrated as I was! He took the time to figure out what was going on (apparently when swiped the cards say $0, but when typed in it says $15, so bizarre!!!!) AND compensated us with a butter cake desert for the hassle!

Second visit: At first we thought the server may just be a nervous new server. (I know how it is) But after a while we just realized it was something else. He made us feel extremely uncomfortable the entire visit.  Third visit: We were hesitant to come, but thought we'd give it one more shot since we were craving their Chopped Salad. This time we waited 10 minutes at our table and no one came by to greet us so we left.

There was no wait for seating although it was lunch time during the weekend. The hosts and server were all friendly and had smiles. Service was great with just enough time to decide on our lunch items and Jesse, our server, came to check up on our refillable peach lemonade and root beer periodically. We started off with sourdough bread and olive oil. It was delicious compared to the original white bread and butter they used to have. For our entrees, we ordered the salmon and Chipotle chicken pizza. The salmon was not dry and was served with a corn salad. The pizza could have been spicier and perhaps a little more saucy. Aside from the minor details, both dishes were good. I would order the salmon again but try a different kind of pizza.

Michael S.,"Washington, DC",43,53,15,4.0,4/28/2009,"While the food is kinda expensive, it's definitely worth it. CPK is a great place to take a date or to just have a nice dinner without totally breaking the bank. Be prepared to wait a while on peak times, like Friday and Saturday nights. There's generally about a 20-30 minute wait, even for just two people. The restaurant itself is very nice, but a bit small. An unfortunate side effect of the smaller size is that they have a number of ""half-booths"" that have spots for two people on a shared booth and two more people sitting opposite on regular chairs. You get the table to yourself, but these are located incredibly close to other tables with the same layout and so you'll wind up sitting nearly right next to another party which sucks. There's hardly any room and definitely no privacy. I would highly recommend asking to wait for a booth. This will add to your wait time, but will make your dinner much more enjoyable. Consistency is a huge selling point here. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal and the service is always great. The waiters and waitresses will hang out for a second to make sure you've got everything you need and will chat a bit (but not too much) if you start it off. Having great customer service is definitely a priority at this location, and it shows. Appetizers come out very quickly, and if you haven't tried it yet you absolutely need to get their spinach artichoke dip. It is absolutely amazing. Make sure to ask for pita bread on the side (don't have them replace the chips with it), because that makes an already awesome appetizer even better. Main courses sometimes take a bit to make it to your table, but I've always been kept up to date by the waiter or waitress and I've rarely had to ask for a refill of my drink. I've had deserts or other small things comp'd on my check if I had to wait too long for something, always without having to ask for it. The outside dining was recently converted to allow it to be enclosed (thing BJ's patios) and they have numerous portable heaters so you can pretty much eat outside any time of the year. There's this odd sewer smell coming from that area of the Brea Mall (not coming from CPK, but somewhere in the parking lot) which can make this undesirable. CPK is one of the few restaurants that I actually enjoy tipping well at. I get great service and am incredibly happy to leave great tips in appreciation.

There were also a few interesting dishes that we had a lot of trouble choosing between since they all sounded so good. However I was really, really disappointed with the pizza when it came out. I got the ""original hand tossed"" variety, called ""The works"". What came out was an extremely flat pizza that looked like something I might buy frozen at a store and make at home. It was the size of most personal pizzas. The variety of ingredients on it made it pretty tasty, but I honestly cannot justify paying almost $16 for the pizza I got.  My boyfriends pizza was the ""thin crust"" type and literally was SO thin that it looked like they cooked it on a tortilla. His was also almost $16.

Love both and they have a great taste with this combination. The dressing is light and not overbearing. Something that you should try out.  The service is nice and if you want to get some bread you should ask for it while the server gets the water. One of my favorite salads to eat is the Asian one and the vegetable salad. :) Also if you want something that is pasta I did enjoy the portabello mushroom ravioli.

Michael C.,"Downey, CA",11,31,9,4.0,3/3/2013,"I've gone to CPK at various locations every once in a while for almost 20 years.  So I was pleasantly shocked today when I found that they replaced the cold sourdough sliced bread & butter with fresher warm & soft thicker pieces of bread that comes with a tasty oil-based dip with little green stuff.  It may have even been freshly baked but I am not sure.  I had to ask, and the waiter said this was indeed a recent change.  This type of complimentary bread was good enough to request 3 sets to eat.  It helps a lot when one is hungry and waiting for pizza or when one pizza is not enough to eat. I find that joining their email list and getting occasional coupon offers that you can stack with gift card use is a more economical way to enjoy CPK.  Costco sells $100 worth of gift cards for $80.  The CPK web site had a Black Friday deal in 2012 for $40 free gift cards with purchase of $100 gift card also.  I justified such a large purchase back then thinking I would give four $25 cards as gifts, but then decided to keep them because I think I enjoy pizza a lot more than the average person.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea?start=240

Than after few minutes came the Manager asking if everything is okay we said one pizza is cold. He said he checked with kitchen manager and the pizza came right out of the oven so there is no reason for it to be cold and walked away. For rest of lunch the manager never came to our table but all the tables around us he visited at least 3 times. It costs us $40 for two pizza's which was worthless . Did not expect this!!!

This particular CPK is in a mall for crying out loud. I've been here a few times and upon walking into the restaurant I can always hear a baby crying somewhere. Granted, I get it, they can't help it. But still...Feels a little bit like a Chuck E Cheese, not exactly a date location. At least not this specific one. And what is UP with the layout of this restaurant, it's so awkward - long and narrow. Narrow spaces and babies don't mix well. Yummy: Bravo on their new Small Bites menu. More so, new small portion dishes adds more variety to your meal instead of the standard ""pizza"". Which by the way, is scrumptious as well. Vegetarian options are a plus. Service, could be much better... just because its a major chain that people will go to, doesn't mean they should lack at service. It seems like a mission to find your waiter in every visit.

For food, we started with Dynamite Shrimp, then ordered California Club pizza and Kung Pao Spaghetti. The Dynamite Shrimp is lightly fried and had a nice chili sauce that was just slightly spiced. I've had California Club before and it still feels interesting to have lettuce and avocado on a pizza. The Kung Pao Spaghetti was my first time trying and it really impressed me. I usually don't eat spicy food, so one was really really spicy to me, but I still couldn't stop eating it even as my mouth and lips were already feeling the burn.

John S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",301,111,31,3.0,4/5/2012,"GREAT PIZZA....BUT SMALL PORTIONS & LARGE TABS I should start by saying this place does live up to it's reputation, it has some amazing pizza...and it has small portions at a ridiculous price.  Do I recommend it? Yes, definitely worth a try and I promise you will love it, but you might not go every day given the portions and their prices.  So they offer a large variety of pizzas (and other stuff too but who goes to CPK for anything but pizza let's be real). They have pizzas with every topping you could think of and some you didn't think of. They offer toppings from the obvious choices like pepperoni, vegetables, sausage, etc. to more surprising toppings like avocado, lettuce, scallions, tortilla strips, corn and even some crazy sauces like ranch dressing, black bean salsa, lime cream sauce, and mayonnaise. They have some very unique creations like the Chipotle Chicken with enchilada cheese and salsa, the thai chicken which has tortilla strips, the pear and gorgonzola, or the works with spring salad. And of course the list goes on and on, but the main point is that the only original thing here might be to order a simple pepperoni pizza, if they let you that is. So the first time I went here I got the Hawaiian bbq chicken pizza which was amazing and a half! It comes with bbq chicken, fresh pineapples, green onions, and red onions on normal crust. The pizza was amazing, the only downside was that it was a personal pizza that did not fill me up and that alone was over $10...so yeah kinda disappointed to some degree.  Overall some amazing pizza I definitely recommend anyone who has never tried it to go here at least once, just go in knowing you are going to pay high prices with smaller portions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea?start=260

Jennifer A.,"Orange, CA",15,64,8,3.0,6/16/2017,"This place is neither great nor terrible.  I frequently order take-out from this location when I am at work.  Usually everything goes okay with the exception of timeliness but if this facility receives any to-go orders that are more complex or bigger than just one or two people each or they have a catering job then the entire process is a disaster.  I don't know what the deal is but it seems they simply do not have a sufficient system worked out to handle anything more complex than someone picking up lunch for themselves.  The entire staff is discombobulated when having to deal with orders like that, seemingly no matter how much advanced notice they have.  And if you are ordering one meal for yourself to go and they get a big order then be prepared to wait.  A long time and with zero communication.   Additionally, if you order online the website gives you a very specific time for pickup and the order is usually not ready at that time.  So if you are in a hurry or only have a limited time to pick your order up because you are working then I would not recommend coming here because you're probably going to be late.  I have waited from anywhere from 25-45 minutes for a to-go order from the time I was told to arrive.    I come here a lot--at least two or three times per month for the last year or so, so my review is not based on one or two experiences, this is how it is 70% of the time.  Luckily I'm on salary. If I weren't then I'd never be able to eat here.  The staff is *usually* friendly but frenzied.  They really need to find a way to more efficiently deal with pick up and catering orders.   The food is good and prices fair enough but efficiency is a major pain point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea?start=20

I added lime chicken, mistake. Not really worth the price, it was cooked okay, a little dry, not that limey at all. The service was great though! really friendly people, and quick seating cause we called ahead. So definitely props to that.  If you are a fan of the food/your dish, definitely go.

Dennis L.,"Placentia, CA",6,36,,3.0,7/24/2014,"CPK used to be one of our favorite chain restaurants.  We like its innovating and constantly updating menu items.  The food items deserve 4- 4.5 stars.  But my affinity toward CPK has been tempered by inconsistent service and long wait time for food.  For this particular location, there was one occasion where the hostess was downright rude toward an elderly family member - to be fair, that was probably an isolated incident.  Otherwise, I wouldn't say the service is bad, but it certainly leaves more to be desired.  One quite a few occasions, it took a long time for the server to come over to the table after we were already seated, and then the server basically did not come back for water or follow-up throughout the meal despite empty or half empty glasses.  Another issue is the wait time for food (not for table) - while we know this is not McDonalds, the average wait time for food has been consistently (and at times unbearably) long compared to other similar restaurants. We usually ask for the complimentary bread when we order the food, and one time we were told that bread was not available because the bread slicing machine was broken... seriously? Maybe another isolated incident.  I don't think there is anything wrong with the service standard from an institutional standpoint, but too many isolated incidents of bad /mediocre service certainly can have the potential of leaving a bad taste in a diner's mouth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea?start=280

Sarah C.,"Brea, CA",166,4,,5.0,10/11/2017,"I placed an order with CPK a couple of days ago that arrived not only incorrect, but in complete disarray.  My pizza was burnt to a crisp and my salad sat for a half hour on top of an order of hot pasta rendering it warm and slimy.  As most of my food was inedible I called CPK and asked to speak to a manager.  I spoke to Fernando and explained that I had waited over an hour for my food, spent nearly 10 minutes on hold waiting to speak to him, and since I have a broken left leg and a broken right foot, it's not like I could run up to the nearest drive thru to get food.  This is when I received bar none THE highest level of customer service I have ever experienced.  Instead of giving me the number for Grub Hub to request a refund for my $50+ botched order, he said he would take care of that for me and asked if I would like the food re-made.  As it was 9:30 pm at this point and I was extremely hungry but immobile, I said that I would appreciate that very much.  He said that he was getting off work shortly, and instead of waiting for a Grub Hub driver to replace my order, he said he would deliver it to my apartment on his way home to ensure it was hot and fresh.  Not 25 minutes after I hung up the phone, there was Fernando at my door with my entire order of food remade, a copy of the email from Grub Hub confirming my refund, as well as $30 worth of vouchers to use on my next visit to CPK.  I was blown away and beyond grateful that the manager of a restaurant would take the time and effort he did to ""make it right.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea?start=40

Michael H.,"Walnut, CA",253,105,147,3.0,3/23/2015,"They redid their interior and it looks a lot more spacious. I love CPK and is probably one of my to-go restaurants if I want some decent food. Food -bbq chicken pizza was amazing. was not disappointed and of course their pizza are delicious -lobster flat bread had too much mayo IMO. I had to use cholula sauce to wash down the mayo. I dont think it blends well with the flat bread. The lobster is soft warm while the flatbread is hard and crunchy. I think this would be better if served as like a lobster maine roll. -baked potato soup - way too cheesy. soup was cold and was not too great -quesadilla was like a caribbean style quesadilla. was in their appetizer section but wasn't all too good. not much cheese or chicken in it. Definite upside to this place was they free bread they give out. They improved it so much compared to their old bread and butter and this new one was so delicious! The waiter was nice but seemed very sad for some reason. Did not enhance my eating experience and wish he seemed happier. Overall for price, quality, and service this place is a 3 star.

Rick L.,"Yorba Linda, CA",4,28,1,5.0,2/13/2012,OK so the food was not that amazing BUT... Service was outstanding. I say that AFTER my wife could not get her first request. Basically went there on a busy Sunday afternoon and sat on the patio. Only one other couple was on the patio and the inside was hopping. I usually do not like sitting outside because I always worry about getting served. Seems many places forget you. We sat down and with in moments the young man Chris came over and asked for our drink orders. He was back in 2 shakes with our drinks.  Few minutes later we placed our order. My wife ordered the Salmon and I ordered the Jambalaya. We also ordered the Devil Shrimp. The shrimp was deep fried and covered in some kind of delicious cream sauce. We both loved it. My Jambalaya was typical stuff not fantastic but definitely very good. The Salmon however was NOT available!! Oh My. How did they handle you ask?? Well prior to coming out our server checked with his boss and was told to basically give my wife whatever dish she wanted at no charge!!! What the ..... She ordered the Kung Pao Pasta which was nothing special but definitely tasty. We also had the Apple Desert with Ice Cream. The Crisp. It was good. Not enough Caramel.  Great Service guys. I cannot count the times this has been handled terribly. Many places I have been end up telling you about the missing dish once they bring everyone else's food. Handled in spectacular fashion.

So what set this one apart? Service was a little slow, but we went at 3:30, when staff is changing and things are calm, so that's forgiven. We always order the flavored lemonades because they are delicious. The one's here were super potent, with lots of flavor shots. Some may like this, but it was far too sweet and I could only drink one before switching to water. What I loved though was that our waiter boxed our left overs for us. This is one of the things I loved most about this restaurant and most CPKs have been failing to offer this anymore.  That's why I give this review an extra star, for class.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea?start=300

Nick J.,"Koreatown, Los Angeles, CA",447,61,10,4.0,11/29/2010,"I have no shame in pointing out that I've sampled most of the fare off the CPK menu and it is (generally speaking) all very tasty eats.  In terms of quality and taste, CPK pretty much delivers a consistently satisfying pizza every time I've gone.  If you're in the mood for an appetizer, order the wheat pita bread with oil and vinegar.  So good! I'm not sure it's actually on the menu.  I'm not giving the place 5 stars simply for the fact that I believe the prices should be cheaper.  This is more of a comment to ALL of the CPK's that I've been to in the past (and there have been many):  The servers have always been perfectly pleasant and prompt with the refills.  To my oft pretentious foodie friends, I assure you that CPK is chain restaurant where you can feel comfortable spending your dough.

Amie P.,"Whittier, CA",145,10,1,3.0,2/15/2013,"All of my experiences dining here have been great, but I recently interviewed for them and I did not like how it was handled at all!  The manager was 30 minutes late due to a conference call, which I thought was a little unprofessional. By the time she finally got to my interview, there was already another girl sitting next to me waiting for her appointment, which was after mine.  After that, the interview went well & she told me I would hear back from them no matter what their response was by the weekend. I never got a call, so I called them twice. The first time I called, I was told that the manager was, once again, on a conference call and the second time, they said someone would call me back, but never did. It's been 3 weeks with no response & obviously I gave up on getting one a while ago. I think there is a huge lack of professionalism on that aspect. Aside from my interview experience, the wait staff is great! When I came in to fill out my application, they gave me a soda on the house which was sweet, and did the same thing while I waited for my interview. Eating here has always been good.

Who can go wrong with pizza, especially amazing creative ones that tickle your taste buds with a warm, fresh bowl of artichoke spinach dip on the side. :) Mmmmmm. So it was a typical Tuesday night for my bf and I. After hitting up a few stores, we decided on CPK for dinner; an old favorite. Surprisingly, the restaurant was decently filled even on a Tuesday night yet the hostess managed to sit us quite quickly. We decided to try something different other than the thai chicken and BBQ chicken pizzas. We agreed on the Carne Asada with steak instead of chicken. Our spinach artichoke dip appetizer came out fast but our pizza took FOREVER. We practically nibbled on our appetizer and by the time we finished, our pizza still wasn't out! Thumbs down! What felt like a zillion years later, our pizza finally arrived nicely presented like all their dishes. Their Carne Asada pizza had an appealing pile of corn, onions, black beans, and tomatoes and an evenly amount of steak distributed amongst each slice. Mmm, it was really good! Imagine a burrito pizza, I know it sounds a bit funky but is really good, and spicy! If you can't stand the heat, don't even bother. If you can, ask for Chula hot sauce!

For pizza's, the chipotle chicken pizza, its spicy and sweet at the same time with a mexican flare to it. My beau always gets the chicken marsala with chalula sauce (sadly it isnt on the menu anymore). All the pastas are pretty good. I've never been disappointed with what I ordered here.

We went last Friday and I really didn't like our waitress. She seemed like she was just doing a job not really enthusiastic about serving customers. They get one star for activating our sensor within 5 minutes(even though they said the wait would be 15) but it went so so from there. First we ordered drinks. I ordered an Iced tea but realized that I'd actually rather drink something fizzy with my food. When it was time for refills I asked for a diet pepsi intstead,(I've been at other restaurants where the waitress would happily oblige a change in drinks but not this witch(lol)). She said that if I wanted to switch drinks, they have to charge for a separate drink. I just accepted the policy but of course mumbled some stuff as she left. The reason this policy is so idiotic is because the Iced tea costs the same as the fountain drinks(at least at CPK) which in itself is a little strange because usually iced tea is a little cheaper. Idk gotta ask my waitress friend about this one! So a switch shouldn't have been such a big deal, but whatever! I still love that place enough to go back.
