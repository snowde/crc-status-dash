Kevin M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/8/2013,"Good for kids, but not if you're a kid yourself. We're high school students and they ignored us for 10 minutes. The guy who took our order was disorderly and dripped sweat on our table, and we had to wait for a good 10 minutes before being able to flag someone down. Oh yeah, and thanks for the nonexistent bread that was given to us. My friend's drink was taken away from friend, presumably to be refilled, but it was never given back... it took them 25 minutes just to take out the bread, and then 30 minutes to get mediocre food. I just don't think I'm ever going to come here again, and I don't suggest that you do, either",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brentwood?start=120

They were quite nice and went with the flow of our big group. Props to them for that. And, again, the food was rather good.

Rachel R.,"Cool, CA",372,1059,12,4.0,2/5/2006,The location requires parking in the underground lot.  CPK offers some unusual pizza selections (like BBQed chicken pizza) and delicious soups and salads.  Their focaccia with checca (chopped tomatoes) is tasty and filling.  Their lemonade is decent. Vegan Report: Their vegetarian Smashed Pea and Barley soup is awesome. I also love the Thai Linguini without chicken and the Thai Crunch Salad without chicken.

Bob D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,102,2,2.0,4/17/2010,"Ok, been to this and other cpk's several times. Meh.  The pizza is over salted most of the time and sometimes even comes out a little undercooked.  You get a decent amount of pizza for an individual size, but it's definitely not enough to share a single one.  I've had service issues at this one, but generally it's ok.   The bread and ice-cold packets of butter they bring out are awful, and the only reason I eat it is because when the place is busy it takes a while to get some food out.   I havn't found an appetizer I enjoy besides the Spinach Artichoke dip (which isn't bad).   I'm pretty particular about pasta, so I'll just say CPK's pasta dishes did not make the cut.   If you go here, get pizza and pizza only.  I'd still suggest going elsewhere for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brentwood?start=120

The bbq chicken pizza rocks and my mouth waters for it everytime, but I had to wait 10 minutes to get my drink order in and another 10 minutes to get my drink. Now thats 20 minutes I waited without ordering my bbq chicken pizza which made my stomach angry. Now, when my stomach gets angry, no one can appease him, except a bbq chicken pizza that is ready to eat. At this point I'm even getting angry, and I'm usually a cool guy.

Ken F.,"Culver City, CA",1,43,,4.0,10/29/2008,"I admit it...CPK is my guilty pleasure.  It's a chain, it has a consistent, corporate feel between stores that is diametrically opposed to the quirky one-off restaurants I often frequent, but I like it. I've frequented many locations, but the Brentwood store is closest to my office and is my current favorite.  And as consistent as they try to be, some crews are just better than others, and the Brentwood crew is one of the best.  The counter is anchored during the day by Johnny, who always remembers my very customized pizza and keeps my glass refilled.  If he did this just for me I'd be impressed, but he always seems to have a counter full of regulars who appreciate his excellent service as much as I do. I'm not going to help you out much with the food here.  It is a pretty simple concept with a wide variety of tasty, consistent dishes.  I like the Japanese Eggplant pizza but my favorite is the Tostada pizza (with Serrano peppers added.)  You won't miss with the food, but I appreciate the excellent service and the somehow the ambient noise is the perfect background for reading a magazine over lunch.  Extra points for a willingness to customize orders without complaint, and a terrific attitude about redos if they goof.

This CPK has THE WORST service.  I am glad I am not the only person with this complaint on here...but seriously, it has gone from decent to bad to horrible.  I wouldn't think it is possible to have so many awful servers all in one place, but they have taken the cake.   In one visit, all of the below actually happened:  - Waited to be seated while the hostess was busy chit chatting with one of the servers.  - Once seated, no server came over for over 5 minutes - I ordered tea...brought hot water, no tea bag.  By the time I got my tea bag, the water was cold.  - Had appetizers, waiter came to take our order and bring more water (only because we had to ask) - didn't think to clear the dirty plates.  - We watched as our food sat on the counter for AT LEAST 5 minutes...finally the ""chef"" brought it over...it was cold.  - I tried to get our waiter's attention as she was chatting with the ""chef/manager"" and several other useless servers...no luck.  Finally the ""chef"" comes over and asks ""What's the problem??""  - My order was incorrect - I told the ""chef"" who had brought it over (since our server was nowhere to be found) and her  response with heavy attitude: ""well, I just made it how it was entered in the computer.""   - My boyfriend told her how his pizza was completely cold and instead of asking if they could make a new one or even simply apologizing, she sighed and said ""well, I could heat it up for you if that's a problem.""   - We all asked for an additional round of drinks...10 minutes later, drinks arrive...she walks away without taking all of the empty glasses.  - The bill was incorrect - Waiter & ""chef/manager"" continued to whisper and stare until we left.   And no, it was not busy at all.   Maybe 6 seated table and at least 3-4 servers.  So there is NO excuse.

Nahid T.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,13,,4.0,8/5/2014,"CPK is my child's favorite place to dine.  Their split pea soup and cold tiramisu desert are great hits with her.  They will also provide side dishes not on the menu, such as stir-fried mushrooms and garnish olives, for her picky appetite.  We love the friendliness of the staff, valet validation option, and personable manager.  We are picky eaters and very aware of oil quality, and have appreciate CPK's use of healthier  choice of ingredients (never had digestion issues eating there, yet). However, reduction of salt in their soups and other foods would be a very nice improvement.  Another improvement would be more selection of healthy and simple salads and bistro-type options on their appetizer menu (not the main meal menu), especially for the carb-conscious, and an adjustment in the high acidity of their salad dressings (that really matters).    Any remote town we're visiting, we look for CPK branches as a sure bet for decent quality meal that won't upset our stomach and would appease the kids as well.  It would also be nice to see this restaurant make available more local selections, drawing from local produce.  Those always seem to taste the best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brentwood?start=100
Char L.,"Culver City, CA",111,1567,23,3.0,1/9/2008,"Since CPK is a chain, the food is pretty standard across the board and yummy, so this review would be more about the location. This is in a great area of town with lots of restaurants, shopping, celebrity sightings. The only problem is parking. If you are really lucky you will find meter parking. If you don't mind walking a few blocks, you might find parking in the residential areas. Most likely you will park in the underground garage where they valet your car and charge you about $2 with validation for the time it takes to eat a meal.  This CPK is on the 2nd floor of the building and is very small compared to other CPKs. It has a very cozy feel to it. On a weeknight, there was no wait to be seated, so I guess the size works for this location. The staff was attentive and service was quick.  My only comment about the food: We had asked for 2 salads with dressing on the side; however, only 1 salad had that order followed. The other salad was already tossed w/the dressing.  Overall 3.5 stars. -1 for inconvenient parking, -0.5 for dressing on salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brentwood?start=100
Al L.,"North Hills, CA",0,21,,2.0,10/17/2012,"Two stars is problably appropriate.  Salad was so-so.  Their BBQ chicken salad used to be decent -- what I had the other day was kind of meh.  It needed extra BBQ sauce to be decent enough to actually eat. I must have been out of my mind, because I decided to order a fruit smoothie.  The smoothie was not worth drinking, and didn't actually have any fruit in it.  Fruit to CPK apparently means some sort of flavoring liquid with the name of a fruit on it's label that's poured into the drink you order.  Even Red Robin puts actual fruit in their drinks. After having not more than the top 1/4 inch of it, I pushed it away.  Later on in the meal the server made the mistake of asking us if we needed anything.  I told him I needed him to take the smoothie away and throw it in the trash. The GF and our guest both had pizzas, which apparently were OK but nothing spectacular.  Dessert, a chocolate something or other was pretty good.

They can do a half and half on their pizzas as long as it uses the same base sauces at no extra cost. If you want a half and half with different sauces then they charge you extra.  The service was prompt and our server was nice. The other good thing about this meal was that we used a gift card our boss gave us as Christmas presents but none of his employees have used it yet.

I don't think I need to write a detailed review of the food at a chain restaurant but if you've never had CPK in your life and are curious as to what's good, you can't go wrong with the chicken tequila fettucine or the original bbq chicken pizza.   As for this CPK location, it's located on the second floor of the interesting looking plaza on San Vicente and Barrington. There's outdoor seating which is always nice and appreciated in sunny LA. Service for our large group was great. Reservations not taken but they'll ""take down your name"" if you call in.

Although I have been to this location a number of times in my life, I haven't been in a quite some time.  We came in for a late dinner around 9:30pm. Parking was incredibly simple. The parking garage downstairs was quick and very easy. And, since it was so late, we didn't even get charged to park down there.  We had a tough time deciding what exactly it was that we wanted to eat, but our server Tyree was very patient, friendly, and helpful with suggestions. We ordered the split pea and barley soup, a barbecue chicken pizza, and a quinoa- arugula salad, which were all reasonably good. He was very attentive to our table and made sure that we had everything we needed including bread and some olive oil while we waited.   California Pizza Kitchen has definitely become a little bit more upscale over the years.  The night we were there, CPK was even offering a rib-eye steak entree as well as a grilled halibut entree.  We didn't order these, but it is nice to see the menu opening up further.

I've eaten here a couple times, and had their food for work meetings about once a month.  The first time I've had food from this CPK was through delivery to work for a meeting. My food was alright, but there was hair in two of my co-worker's food.  Second time.. delivery again. Hair in another co-worker's food.  Other times... they seem to forget when we ask for ""extra of something,"" but when we ask to omit something, they tend to get that correct. Cheap, much? o.o Oh, they also skimp out on the full sized salads too. I was sad. The service has been around the same both times I've eaten at this CPK. A different person would come to our table each time, and the food took a while. No full bar, etc. It seemed a bit odd in there, but the food was okay.

Onyekachi A.,"Beverly Hills, CA",391,123,150,4.0,3/27/2015,"I am an avid lover of California Pizza Kitchen and this location does an excellent job of maintaining the quality and deliciousness that I would expect.  Location: Located on San Vicente Blvd, lunch time can be an absolute Bi&*h when it comes to parking...especially if you just want to get take out which leads me to the next section!! Parking: It's a killer especially at lunch trying to find parking of any kind. They do have a parking structure which is nice if you are looking to dine in BUT if you are like me and have to do take out or curbside...good luck. The problem is most of the time there is someone parked in the passenger loading zone which makes it incredibly hard to get your damn take out! It's unfortunately that CPK hasn't realized that they should have the curbside parking in the actual parking structure...it would just make things move a lot more smoothly. Food: When it comes to the food you can't go wrong with anything...and the butter cake is an absolute must order if you haven't had it before. When I have time to sit and relax for a second i like to have the Carribean Sunset Sangria while I wait and especially with this heat it's refreshing and alcoholic so yay!!! Would i recommend you come here!!?? Yes of course just make sure to not bet on finding street parking during lunch hours and you will be fine!!

I like the bbq chicken salad and my wife and I share a pasta that we custom order. The challenge with this place is the service. I've called to order a pizza to go at 10pm last week, they close at 10:30pm on weekends. I was told they were no longer making pizzas. I asked if I showed up at the restaurant to eat would they turn me away? The hostess explained that I would not be turned away but said I could not place an order still. At that time I asked to speak to a Manager. The Manager immediately apologized to me and took my order. I picked up the pizza got home and order was wrong. I called the next day and my money was refunded and I was given a $30 gift card. I thought that was fair. Last night we went back and was greeted by a server who's first words out of her mouth were ""what's your order"" my wife and I looked at each other in shock and then looked at the server, said hello and asked how she was doing. She responded by saying ""hi, good, I'll give you guys a few minutes"". Had we not had the gift cards to use we would have walked out which I think she wanted us to do since it was 9:30pm.

My daughter went with the caramel peach salad. Despite the fact that I had a half portion salad, it was more than enough to leave me completely filled. My salad had a generous amount of chicken and a good amount of chips. My only criticism would be that the salad came with a little too much BBQ sauce on it. The next time I will order it with a barbecue sauce on the side, then add the amount that I think is appropriate. My wife the half order of the Italian chopped salad.

We split a BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad and the Pear & Gorgonzola Pizza. The salad was decent but very little chicken and BBQ taste or dressing but the pizza was off the hook good. My usual fave is the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Pizza (and it is still one of the best on their menu) but someone turned me onto this Pear & Gorgonzola and OMG it's so delish! Surprisingly there were a several tables with young children at them out on the patio. My dog was more well behaved than they were as was another pup on the patio. I take control if my pup gets a little hyper while out and I wish more parents these days would do the same. I could never get away with that crap when I was a kid!!!

While it was a bit discouraging to find out how many calories are in each dish, everything tasted delicious as always.  I was delighted to find out that my favorite Portobello Mushroom Ravioli was on the light side for pastas.  On top of the great food, service was fabulous today.  We had a party of 10 and all received our food within 15 minutes of ordering.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brentwood?start=80

When we first arrived they said it would be about a 20 minute wait.  While we were waiting, I overheard a waitress laughing that she had given food to the wrong table.  That was my first hint that dinner may not go smoothly.  Another party walked in and asked how long it would be and it seemed like the hostess was trying to say anything to get them to leave.  She kept saying - it's going to be a wait, the servers are really busy and trying to catch up.  I was pretty sheocked and how unprofessional and sad it was that they are so overwhelmed they are trying to get people to leave. Now if you've been there before, you know that it's a really dark restaurant.  Well we were seated at a table where the few light bulbs that existed above were all out.  I could barely see my menu (and i couldn't see my food at all when it arrived).  The tables next to us were empty, but completely dirty.  I've never seen a restaurant with so many empty, dirty tables before. I ordered a sprite and the waitress said ""sorry we are out of sprite"" Really?.  My father ordered a beer.  When the waitress brought our drinks, she clearly brought a different beer than what my father had ordered.  When asked, the waitress said they were out of the beer he ordered and she had brought a different one.  She barely knew the name of the beer she brought us and couldn't tell us if it was a wheat beer or not.  My father is allergic to wheat.  So after a google search of what the beer was, of course it was a wheat beer.  She wasn't even going to mention it was a different beer-- we had to figure out whether it would make my father sick or not.  For dinner, I ordered a Chicken Caesar salad and the waitress said ""I'm sorry we are out of parmesan cheese."" A pizza place is out of cheese? Really? After a long wait, finally our food arrived.  The chicken in my salad came black and inedible.  The salad maybe had a small drop of dressing on it-- the salad was pretty much dry.  I couldn't even tell what salad they were trying to make.  It was really upsetting that we had to pay for this food, but I didn't want to make a scene when we were trying to have a nice family dinner. At the table next to us, a family with two small children were eating.  I overheard that the mothers meal also came black and burnt and inedible.  The waitress offered to remake it for her, but she said no thank you because their food took so long to come and the children needed to go to bed. My family and I decided-- as we love CPK-- we will never come to this location again.  Thanks but no thanks.  I can't believe such a popular famous restaurant could operate like this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brentwood?start=20

However, the quality of the cheese and the veggies did not exceed my expectations, it is pretty average. There are better pizzas with fresher & realer ingredients worth the few extra bucks.

We came here on the fourth for a family dinner and we were less than pleased with our waitress. We understand that nobody would work on the fourth if they do not have to, but we still expect DECENT service. This woman wanted us out... and immediately.  We did not get bread and butter like we normally do at our local CPK. Upon asking for it, the waitress said that they do not have any more bread. Ok, reasonable-- they ran out.  Next we asked for refills for our drinks. She told us that they had turned off their soda fountain. Alright... why would you do that if we are still here? Or better yet, why did you take us in.  To top it all off, she did not even offer a desert menu. We had to ask for one and when we ordered the butter cake, she said that they had turned their ovens off. Icing on the cake.

There's a loading zone, and you can just swing in there with your emergency flashers on and a CPK employee will run the food downstairs to your car. Tip the poor soul, won't you?

The salads have more fat, calories and sodium than most of the other menu items here, so as long as you are not tricking yourself into thinking you are doing something good for yourself, you're fine.

They this line is ""I'll be right with you "" when they come back in about 15 minutes. We wish they had better servers since the cooks food is good.Bad management in action. At Xmas, they do not take in account HANAKKUH or Atheists. They overwhelm with Xmas music like that's smart idea anymore.

They said they are sending me a gift card (how is that a gift?) then like an idiot I went back two days later and they were super unaccommodating. I asked for pineapple juice and orange juice mix and they refused saying it's not on the menu. So okay whatever. I order a thin crust artichoke spinach pizza with pepperoni. It comes out undercooked, soggy, ugly and with only 5 pepperonis on it. I ate the 5 pepperonis off and bit the pizza it was awful. Awful. They have fell off the map and the food is gross. They don't put any effort into what they are doing and don't have a true love for what I'm ordering. I'm never eating Cpk again. They disgust me. It's very depressing too because that the place I eat at most. When I explained my disdain and even food poison to the management they should have either remade my food or refunded me.

Way Too expensive for me.  I decided to order a pizza. I looked all over the menu and found the pizzas hiding under a fold down flap.

The strozzapreti pasta with mushrooms, a very uncommon pasta that you rarely see on menus. I use to get it when my aunt made it for me growing up. Their food overall is very good and consistent. For a chain restaurant they've done a great job in creating a fresh high quality restaurant. I've had many items on the menu from their pizzas to their pastas and salads. The chicken piccata and the strozzapreti are my favorites. Their salads are very fresh as well. Who ever is developing their recipe knows what going on. The service is always good and they offer a take out as well. They also have a curb side service they offer as well. Which is cool just pull up and they hand off your dinner. It's a great location with convenient parking underground which they validate. The best surprise is the great desserts. Considering they are a pizza salad place their dessert are very good !

Again, all good things but also the type of normalcy that may have you overlooking a place like CPK . I am usually pleasantly reminded of how good their food and dining experience can be. This location also has patio seating and that stretch of San Vicente in the 90049 can make for a great spot to have lunch.  The service at this location is very professional and attentive.  Hey those actors have to start somewhere. The lunch duos consists of several choices. Select 7"" Pizza's or sandwiches combined with a soup or salad.  I opted for the following and it was the perfect sized lunch, well prepared and ""hit the spot"" good.

Malinda C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/3/2016,"I used to love this CPK location, but after a recent experience at the Brentwood location this all changed.  I  was with a few friends and ordered a few pastas and a pizza.  All of the pasta dishes tasted like gasoline, so we complained to the waiter.  The waiter then took a fork and stuck his grubby hands into the food and tasted it.  He claimed there was nothing wrong and that the food tasted great.  We sent the food back and re ordered to find that the pasta still tasted like gasoline.  We got the check and were surprised to see that we were charged twice for each of the dishes we sent back.  Long story short-- never going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brentwood?start=60
Naya R.,"Ventura, CA",4,9,,5.0,1/14/2016,"CPK's pear and gorgonzola pizza (always ask for extra salad on top) will always go unmatched in my book. Also, they recently upgraded their starter bread, which is really much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brentwood?start=60
Theresa B.,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA",437,171,369,4.0,3/7/2014,"Just enjoyed a lovely outdoor lunch at CPK. I was so hungry that I ate before I took a photo of my Sedona Tortilla soup. It was delicious! Thick and flavorful but not spicy. Perfect for me. It could have been a little warmer though. It came out lukewarm instead of piping hot although it could have just cooked quickly being outdoors.  I ordered the Roasted Vegetable salad to take home for dinner later.  The server was fast  and attentive, even offering water for the dogs, which I thought was a very nice touch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brentwood?start=60
Janeane B.,"Canoga Park, Los Angeles, CA",78,134,217,4.0,6/22/2014,"Came here for dinner one night when I was working late. Service was good, prompt, and food was delicious as always. It's not very busy in the evenings as this is more of a business area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brentwood?start=60
Chris B.,"Bakersfield, CA",27,50,29,4.0,8/13/2014,You can never go wrong with CPK. The food is always great and the menu has so much to choose from. I ordered my meal Togo and it was waiting for me when I got there on time. It was really good too. My pregnant girlfriend was very happy with the timing and quality. Great job!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brentwood?start=60
Noel K.,"Brentwood, CA",141,359,78,4.0,11/24/2010,"Another one of those places I take my three year old son in a pinch.  A big enough menu of ""Americanized"" Italian food.  I like the grilled vegetable salad with chicken which I order 90% of the time.  There pizzas are okay if you don't mind stepping outside of the box for traditional pizzas.  I think the pizzas improve if you order them on the thin crust rather than CPH's normal dough...they still are just okay, but better than the regular crust they use. I give the CPK in Brentwood four stars which is probably one star too much...but, I did so because the service when you sit at the counter is damn good.  There is a waiter named Scott who mans the take out  orders and the patrons at the counter, he has been a staple at this location for over 20 years.  Scott always remembers your name, what you like to eat and drink.  He is certainly an asset to this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brentwood?start=60
Zahra B.,"Los Angeles, CA",86,35,32,4.0,7/14/2014,"I love CPK. Today I order avocado egg rolls for appetizer, really good. For lunch I had KUNG PAO SPAGHETTI with shrimp in hot red chilies sauce. My nephew ordered roasted artichoke with spinach  pizza with thin crust. I defiantly recommend this place for family :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brentwood?start=60
J B.,"Cheviot Hills, CA",0,11,1,1.0,3/2/2016,"Won't be back.  Not worth the hassle and it took almost 15 minutes for a server to come by our table when there were only 4 tables seated with customers.  And, the only reason we got a server was because my daughter went to the hostess to ask her to get us a server.  The only plus side, our food came in 5 minutes.  Because it took so long to order, I opted not to eat.  It just took too long!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brentwood?start=60
Laura S.,"Pasadena, CA",948,1507,6131,5.0,11/8/2011,"Okay... this gets a good review because of the customer service... AWESOME. So I went there to get TO GO food.  FOOD: *Garlic Chicken Pizza - always my favorite. I always get this. It's always good with WHOLE WHEAT crust :D Good size for two people or one really hungry person. * Iceberg lettuce salad - Yum.  * Mac N Cheese - their special fried ones that can be shared. Always yummy! SERVICE: Fast, cheap and easy. I left my bag (Halloween costume that my sister borrowed) and I didn't realize it til the next day. I was freaking out (that costume was expensive) and so I called them and told them I left my bag and they said they'd get back to me. And they did. They called and told me they had it and will keep it for me til I went. My sister went to get it for me (close to her home)... So service win! Lifesaver win. Overall: Always been a fan of the food... but the service won me over.  LOCATION: Near Third street and beach... WIN",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brentwood?start=60
Tiffany G.,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA",2532,994,1356,4.0,11/24/2013,"Came here for a late lunch with a great friend of mine. The food was good, standard CPK. The service was ok, albeit a bit slow because it was an off time and not a lot of staff on hand. I forget this place is there because it is upstairs.  I do have to say I love the guacamole appetizer with the chips. It is really tasty. I had a basic pizza this day and it was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brentwood?start=60
