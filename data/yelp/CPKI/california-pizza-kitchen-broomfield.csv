Marisa L.,"Arvada, CO",0,42,1,4.0,8/4/2017,I have always liked it here. No matter what location you go to the food is always consistent. It's a nice little place when you don't want fast food. It's quick convenient and it's good. And its great that they sell liqour. The staff is always friendly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-broomfield
Terry G.,"Louisville, CO",363,286,441,2.0,8/19/2017,"I didn't want to join the throngs at the food court so I decided to try the California Pizza Kitchen. I was seated right away and the waitress was great.  I ordered a personal sized pepperoni pizza and a Caesar salad from the lunch menu. I think it was $ 10.95 for that combo which is a little high for what you get. I ordered water because their liquid menu items are way too high, I think a fountain Coke was $ 3.29. The pizza was just okay, the lettuce in the salad was wilted. This experience won't be repeated when I need to go to the mall again I will eat before I go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-broomfield
Alice Q.,"Denver, CO",2579,1627,6823,2.0,7/15/2017,"The service is was fine and dandy. My boyfriend was craving pizza, but I had gotten full from the bad McDonald's from the early morning that day. Either way, we still intervened into lunch. We liked everyone, we liked our server Tina. The service is not my aim here, but the food (Other than the pizza) was questionable. Holy cow. I wanted something different, pizza was not on my mind. I wasn't interested in their flat breads, small plates, appetizers, but the poke bowls? We hardly even carry poke bowl restaurants in Denver, so I was incredibly shocked that California Pizza Kitchen even had it in its menu. But nonetheless, I was very excited too!!  Bring the Banh Mi Bowl on! Tina, our server, had described that the Banh Mi Poke Bowl was constantly ordered and very popular. I was definitely seeing my guy love his pizza, but my Banh Mi Poke Bowl looked like a very big, tossed salad with cold chicken, veggies, and not really anything else. A bit of ""poke"" (The seeds) but nothing else. I was wondering what was going on. I was trying to work with it, but I kinda gave up. I had a small cup of sauce and that did not even cover anything so I asked for two more little sauce cups. I flagged down Tina and asked for it to be sent back. I even had the manager (nice lady!) and Tina apologized and apologized and nothing could really make it better. I thanked them, I appreciated it. I did not crave it, I wanted something better.  My boyfriend definitely loved his pizza though. Nothing wrong with that!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-broomfield

A Marie J.,"Broomfield, CO",635,228,158,4.0,4/7/2015,"I used to be a regular here until they changed the menu up. It never fails when I get a favorite item at a restaurant, it always gets deleted from the new menu.  Today I tried the Strawberry, Watermelon, and Feta salad. It was delicious. Very fresh and tasty. I also had a dessert for my birthday. The chocolate soufflé cake and it was very rich and delish.

Kevin C.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,48,65,5.0,11/6/2015,My first time ever at this restaurant. I read other reviews but it's a shame that the few people that have a bad experience always review. But the many people that have a god or great experience often are too busy to give them 4 or 5 stars.  On a briskly busy Friday night I sat at the counter. I was immediately greeted by Destiny who gave friendly and attentive service.  I got the thin crust sausage and mushroom pizza. It was delivered in less than 10 minutes and was delicious. I asked for a taste of a beer on tap but ordered Coors light in a bottle instead.  Any downside? Just the wimpy parents too afraid to tell their toddler NOT to incessantly bang the fork in the plate like a drum. And scream with their outside voice instead of their inside voice.  I would come back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-broomfield
Curlygirl A.,"Las Cruces, NM",1,5,,5.0,2/12/2017,"California pizza kitchen is our go to pizza place! Not only do they have a wide variety of pizza potions for decent prices their pasta is nearly as good if not better!

Tiffani H.,"Denver, CO",137,264,483,2.0,12/8/2016,"Not super impressed with cpk like I used to be.  Maybe it's just this location but this is the second time in 3 weeks I have been here and both times walked out feeling like I overpaid fir the quality of food received.   Service was great but the pizza was not as good as I remembered it to be.   First it came out room temp and the crust was like eating cardboard.  Very little sauce on the pizza didn't help. We ended up with a $50 tab for two of us and walked out hungry. The good news is we grabbed our leftovers and gave them to some kids who wanted it with the disclaimer that it wasn't that great.  We did order the tortilla soup and I must say it was good. Not amazing but good.  Next time I'll go to P.F. Chang's, spend the same amount and walk out happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-broomfield

To my dismay the whole bar was covered in dirty plate that hadn't been cleared. We stoppee for a few minutes and waited for one of staff to clear something, but that didn't happen. After a few minutes someone cleared the dirty plates, but didn't whip anything down. When it finally came to order they were out of everything and made it clear they were shutting the oven down (30 mins prior to closing).

Rachel S.,"Broomfield, CO",35,66,43,4.0,5/24/2015,"For chain food, I was impressed. The manager was working the floor, and by working, I mean working! He was charming, engaging, and constantly following up to be certain his guests were well taken care of. I've run restaurants and frankly, I was impressed. He asked how we were doing when we came in and I replied, OK. He responded, ""Just OK?"" I said, ""Yes but hopefully the dining experience with you guys will change all of that."" He took me up on my challenge seating us himself. We had our drink order taken and delivered promptly and help with the menu. Shortly after the drinks arrived, our manager arrived with a sample of the thyme gorgonzola focaccia - excellent btw...  Our pizzas arrived on time. The topping distribution was not bad although, an equal amount of each topping was definitely not available from each slice. On the flip-side, the pizza itself tasted great. We had the meat lovers on the thin crust with mushrooms. Most of the time I bring leftovers home and leave them to the kids. Today, I guarded them zealously! The place was reasonably clean given a lunch rush however, the bathrooms needed some work. There were used paper towels on the floor and the vanity needed to be wiped down. Aside from that though, they were clean - no grease creeping out from the corners.  All and all, good and I'll go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-broomfield

Tryna R.,"Denver, CO",55,156,211,3.0,1/18/2015,"It was good and hit the spot for our group.  My niece was hoping for Chick-Fil-A, but this mall did't have one.  My nephew announced it was his new favorite place. I have always ordered a salad with the 2 soups in the same bowl or the thai chicken pizza. This time I saw the spicy chipolte chicken pizza, gluten free for an upcharge.  I was delicious and had these super thin, sprialized jalapenos in it. It was spicy and tasty and reheated awesome the next day. I kinda forgot how good this place is, the basic pizzas are $14 each which I think is pricey for lunch.  Our server was kind, but very forgetful,  My water glass was refilled only once and my niece's chocolate milk was never refilled after she requested one. We ended up sharing my water.  My nephew was not offered a refill of his shake or a water.  Other than the drinks, our visit was a-ok!  It is perfect when you are at the mall and need a quick bite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-broomfield

Erin J.,"Denver, CO",61,380,20,1.0,1/4/2010,"Everytime I eat at a CPK that's not in California, I'm more disappointed than the last time.

Blake H.,"Highlands Ranch, CO",0,46,24,1.0,12/23/2010,"Over priced and small portions in my opinion. I ordered off of the small plate menu thinking it would not be an over sized lunch like some places I have been. Got the Korean BBQ Steak Tacos because that sounded really good. There were 2 tacos on a small plate that were appetizer size at best, I almost told the waitress to just take them back (They actually make them look pretty big on their website, what a myth!). My wife and daughter got a good laugh out of it which did not make me any more happy. You would think the waitress would have mentioned the portion size since that was the only thing I ordered, but no. $5.99 for 2 tiny tacos. Thank goodness I got to finish off my wife's and daughter's salads. This is only the second time I have gone here, and the last!

The pizza, and chicken are nice and hot, but they ad this COLD salsa right before they serve it to you, not very good at all. Next time I will order without if I were to order this pizza again, the service was quick, spinach artichoke dip was delicious as the appetizer, but the blue tortilia chips kind of sucked.

Connor L.,"Portland, OR",621,145,215,3.0,10/6/2013,"Today the girls and I decided to go for some food and shopping in Flatirons. We walked in the entrance smelled and spied CPK and all agreed we were starving.  It was Sunday with a big football game on the tube so the restaurant was pretty much empty. We were immediately seated and got out beverages. Didn't take us long to decide what to eat either. Our food came out quickly as ordered; we were good. We had food in front of us. Each of us was about halfway through our entree, happily eating and chatting away when out server Danielle appeared again. She asked if we wanted to go boxes and containers for our food and didn't really wait for our answer. She walked away and the four of us kinda looked at each other in confusion. She came back about three mins later and asked how we wanted to split our bill. We were all a bit tongued tied, ""Did we say we were ready for our bill or to go?"" We were clearly still eating especially me the world's slowest eater.  We sorted the bill but continued to eat and chat. Danielle never once offered us water or refills on beverages. She didn't come to see if we wanted anything else while we contained to sit and chat. We finally flagged down some other server to get a dessert order placed and to get some water for our table.  Danielle did bring us our dessert when it was done and waters an disappeared again. Once more as we continued to eat our dessert and were not even halfway through she appeared again no to see how we were doing but to get us boxes and our new check.  While we did enjoy our food the service was nothing but disappointing. Danielle was only interested in whatever was going on with her cell phone. We constantly watched her checking it while trying to flag her down for things like water. Her attention to her only table -us- was laughable. I would request another section if presented with the option of being served by her again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-broomfield?start=20
Emma C.,"Denver, CO",30,135,21,4.0,12/17/2013,"We were here on a pretty busy Friday night, and yet the wait was only 20 minutes. We opted for immediate seating at the bar; it was super cool to watch the cooks in action! We ordered a pepperoni pizza which came with about 6 slices, and it tasted phenomenal. We also ordered a slice of their red velvet cake -- talk about heavenly! We were also never short on drink refills, and despite the bartender being overwhelmed with the crowd, he never lost his cool. It kinda took him a while to realize we wanted our check picked up, but once he did (again, benefit of the doubt due to the crowd) it was taken care of quickly. Bonus? The pizza reheated well. You'd be surprised how many pizzerias have pizzas that don't taste nearly as good the next day. Not these guys!

It took a couple of minutes of us standing awkwardly with our shopping bags at the hostess stand before we were seated. I was slightly worried that this would reflect how the rest of the experience went. Happily, it didn't. Our server (Danielle, I think?) was fantastic and super attentive. She always made sure our drinks were filled and made some great recommendations for us. I got the kung pow spaghetti with shrimp and it was SOOOO good. I would bathe in it if I could. It was all I could do not to lick the bowl. One of my companions ordered the same thing and the other (the black sheep dare I say?) got the Jambalaya pasta.

The pizzas are one size (about the size of a big plate with 6 small slices). He ordered the new habanero carnitas pizza and I order the Greek pizza. We both really enjoyed our meals. (His was very spicy and mine was refreshing and a great mix of a warm pizza and cold greek salad.) He finished my pizza for me and was glad to, to tone down the heat of his pizza.  I also ordered a peach Italian soda, which was very yummy and has free refills. The only reason this restaurant doesn't get 5 stars is because of the price. The pizzas are good but not $14 a piece good. Especially since a lot of their toppings are pre-prepared (like the greek salad) meaning you can't customize your pizza by asking for no tomatoes in the salad, no onion, etc. If the meals were around $10 it would be more worth it.
