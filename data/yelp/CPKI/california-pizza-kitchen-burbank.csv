Melissa D.,"San Bernardino, CA",15,20,3,5.0,10/6/2017,"Love everything on their menu! My ultimate Favorites; spinach dip, BBQ chicken pizza, and compow chicken spaghetti. They also serve a great Bloody Mary",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-burbank
Jessica K.,"Burbank, CA",346,175,295,3.0,12/5/2017,"This has been one of my go to places with my family and friends since middle school... so for more than 15 years? Yes a long time. So I've seen this place go from a little more formal restaurant where the waiters wore regulated black and white button ups to a complete 180 it is now where the whole atmosphere is super casual where the waiters wear T-shirts and jeans. They definitely had a rebranding effort and meh idk if it makes that much of a difference but it is more welcoming to everyone now I guess.. The food. hmm. In my opinion, the flavor was better in the past. I loved their Kung Pao Spaghetti, Jambalaya, Chipotle Chicken Pizza, and Thai Chicken Pizza. They are all still good but the portions are definitely smaller than before. I always go to Costco to get their gift card to this place. $79.99 for $100 worth! So that is already 20% off. Also, they have an app that you can download to accumulate points for rewards! Service is bleh. The current manager is a lady in her 30's and she seems unhappy.... no smiling whatsoever. Maybe overwhelmed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-burbank
Tarablake P.,"Los Angeles, CA",297,10,1,1.0,11/26/2017,"Today was my Dad's 60th birthday. My family (5) decided to come here for lunch.  Service: The hostess was nice and seated us right away. She sat us behind the patrician that separates the computers and booth tables toward the back. They put together 3 tables, in which all 3 were wobbling. When we mentioned this to our server, she came back with paper coasters informing us that is all they have. She did not offer to help after that. The runners did not offer any help, either. One of my family members ended up having to adjust the tables. This caught me off guard because we have come to this location on several occasions and the service is always great! Unfortunately, not this time.  Food: We ordered the 5 cheese pizza, the quinoa and arugula salad with salmon, the chicken piccata, and the Â bolognese spaghetti. The salad was great, with the salmon (server suggestion). The spaghetti was dry. Although, we asked for extra meat sauce, it did not change the dryness. It tasted as though the dish was sitting out for some time before it was served to us. Mostly, everything came out around the same time except for the pizza. When we reminded the server about it, she said it was not in her notes. As a customers point of view, she forgot about it. She put in the order and informed us that she put a rush on it. When it came out I pulled one slice off the plate and the pizza was extremely floppy and soggy. The cheese fell right off and the center of the pizza was so thinned out. We had to cancel the order. We did not receive any apologies on this matter, not even from the manager on duty! For dessert, I asked for a butter cake as a surprise for my Dad's birthday. I did not ask for it to be complimentary. I specifically told the hostess to please have the server bring out the butter cake at the end. I don't remember if the one scoop of ice cream is an extra cost but when the the butter cake came out, it was served with no ice cream. It just so happened the the family next to me had a birthday, as well. It looked as though they requested a brownie and it came out the same time our butter cake did. They definitely had a scoop of ice cream on their brownie dessert.  The only thing that gave this place 1 star was the salad and a polite hostess. Overall, the customer service, food, as well as management during today's lunch shift was a disappointment. I am hoping it was just a bad day. I know this may not a big deal to some but it's the little things that matter the most. We had a horrible birthday lunch for my Dad. I don't suggest coming here for big parties.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-burbank
Catarino C.,"Sylmar, CA",29,63,234,4.0,1/4/2018,We placed our order over the phone and the person taking order was very courteous and helpful. We were told our order would be ready in 40 minutes so we showed up 40 minutes later and our order was ready to go. Cashier promptly brought our order to us and we were out of there. Restaurant was clean and staff was helpful. Food is good and noticed they have a bar section inside with sports games playing on television screens. Plenty of free parking in garage adjacent to restaurant. Will probably come back for dinner and a drink with the wife.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-burbank

Marie Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",135,111,61,1.0,6/18/2017,"It's Fathers Day today so we decided on CPK. Coming to this location was a bad idea. I've been in the restaurant industry for about 7 years. From hosting, bussing, running, expediting, serving and managing.  We walked in and there was no wait. They didn't seem busy. Most people like to say ""why is there a wait when there are open tables?"" Or ""why is our service so slow when there are a lot of open tables?""  But it's not by how many open tables there are it's how many servers are on the floor and how big their section is and how many times they were sat. I was looking around and there were about 5/6 servers plus the managers and the hostesses and the bussers.  I felt like every server had about 5 or 6 tables which is pretty normal for most restaurants. But I don't think these servers can handle 5/6 tables. I heard a few of them complaining about how ""slammed"" they were. And servers asking other servers if they wanted to take tables from other sections. We waited some time and wasn't greeted. Our server could have passed us and said ""I'll be right with you"" but she said nothing. She kind of disappeared after serving our drinks. She only checked on us because she caught me staring at her.  Anyway, there was a server named JENN. And this girl was horrible.... SHE WAS EATING AND CHEWING FOOD while serving her tables. Like girl, you could have at least stopped chewing in front of your table! Get it together.  The hostess was really sweet and pleasant though! One star is for her! We ordered the spinach artichoke dip and it was delicious like always.  The garlic roasted chicken was super bland. I would not recommend.  The sangria flight was also pretty decent! I like sangria so it was a go for me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-burbank

Chuck D.,"Los Angeles, CA",656,1173,8506,3.0,3/16/2017,"Havent gone to CPK, let alone this location in so many years. The styling of the place has changed but it seems the menu has mostly stayed the same. I ordered the classic bbq chicken pizza. Was a little disappointed they no longer make the honey wheat crust for their pizzas. It's either white or wheat. Nothing else... I went with white bread crust and asked them to hold the cilantro.  The taste was still good but the crust was just ok. I really liked the honey wheat crust. The bbq sauce and the chicken witht he smoked gouda is classic California style pizza. Could have used a little more chicken pieces but still enjoyed it. Also ordered was the waldorf chicken salad that comes with grapes, green apple slices, candied walnuts, celery and gorgonzola. It was a hit. And another bbq chicken pizza with cilantro.  Good meal, decent prices. Service was fine. Nothing special. Just your typical CPK dinner. Plenty of parking now that Ikea has moved. Complimentary bread with olive oil & vinegar was just ok. No real taste in the dipping sauce.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-burbank
Eric W.,"Las Vegas, NV",424,3,,2.0,1/12/2018,"Food was decent, the avocado egg rolls were not good, salmon was great. The service however, was dreadful. Love CPK but won't be going back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-burbank
Shelley C.,"Los Angeles, CA",470,646,461,1.0,12/21/2016,"Updating my review since I have dined here many times since then. I also need to complain about my last visit here. Came here for dinner, and our server was no where to be found. We sat for 15 minutes just waiting and no one acknowledged us. Finally a lady came over and asked if we'd been helped yet. After we said no, she said she was going to find our server. After some more time, the same lady came out and she ended up being our server for the night. There was a table behind us that got seated as well and they couldn't find our server either who turns out is a really short blond girl. The table behind us waited so long for their food that the father even got up to flag someone down at the bar. What's with this server?? The girl that DID in fact tend to us was good. So, first of all let me say that yes, it was my mistake for ordering something off the menu that isn't pizza. Why go to a place that specializes in pizza and has pizza in the name and NOT order pizza? I don't know. I was craving pasta. So I ended up ordering the shrimp scampi zucchini pasta. I asked if I was able to swap out the zucchini with real pasta like fettuccine but the server assured me that there was already fettuccine in the dish. I was pleased. But then my dish came. I assumed that the shrimp scampi zucchini pasta had zucchini spirals that mimic pasta - a healthier option. NOPE. Just fat chunks of zucchini and maybe only 8 strands of fettuccine. The shrimp was so obviously frozen and looked so unappetizing. Not only that, but the shrimp was WAY overcooked. Didn't eat them. The ""sauce"" to the pasta was so incredibly watery it was gross. I took about 2 bites of my dish and was done - inedible.  So in my experience, not only was our original server MIA, my sad sad excuse for a shrimp scampi pasta dish was pathetic. CPK should be ashamed to have this item on their menu. DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING OTHER THAN PIZZA HERE or you'll get a sad dish. I know to ONLY get pizza here from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-burbank
A K.,"Pasadena, CA",15,42,22,1.0,1/6/2018,"If I could give them 0 stars I would. I just left this place waiting...for over 10 mins at the bar and not one person came over to help or take my order.

Dennisse M.,"Burbank, CA",0,6,,5.0,12/16/2017,"I've been here several times throughout the years and though I have always enjoyed the food I've never felt compelled to write a review until today.   We came for lunch because we were craving a bbq chicken salad. To our surprise they had a shrimp scampi pizza. It was delicious and I was happy because they used to have a shrimp pizza and they took it off the menu. I highly suggest trying it.  But the whole reason for this review was our server Frank. From the moment he came to the table he was a delight. Full of great energy, witty humor, and excellent service. He joked around with our 11 year old and us equally. And every time he walked away we all remarked how much we love him. We came for lunch but left with an experience. From now on we will always ask for Frank. He's definitely the best part of our lunch today. Five stars for Frank.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-burbank

Went at dinner time so we can have a couple of drinks, wife's drink had a bug floating in it.  3. Son wanted to have dinner, place wasn't busy at all, got seated, no one bothered to serve us.

The salmon was spot on and the side had a nice spicy kick to it. We also had a great appetizer lettuce wraps with chicken & shrimp.

Carla S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",2,14,1,4.0,5/29/2017,"We went here for lunch before seeing a play at the Colony theater. We are from Mission Viejo, and we don't go to L.A. very much. We thought this one was better than our local one. The hostess was friendlier and smiled and asked, 'how was your day?'. Â Our server was pleasant and even though the restaurant was full, made it seem that he wasn't rushed for us. I tried the cucumber cooler which was delicious. Â There's no free refills on that one, though. I asked. It's loud in there. We had two small mistakes in our order. I ordered the arugula/asparagus salad, and they served me the wedge. And my mom shouldn't eat meat--for health reasons--and I heard her ask for no chicken on her pizza, but I think I saw some on it. I could be wrong. We were given three dishes of bread--warm bread--and dipping sauce. (My mother is a diabetic, she was on a roll and couldn't stop with the bread. Since it was mother's day celebration for us, I didn't say anything. She was rude to the server, and I was embarrassed). My son had mac n cheese, which he enjoyed. And both my salad and my Hawaiian pizza were fresh. Â I asked for chili pepper flakes, which came in a small bowl with a spoon. Compared to Orange County CPK, this was a more pleasant dining experience, the food was better than both Orange County and Long Beach CPK's we go to.

We had approx an hour before the movie started. The restaurant was pretty busy and we told that we would be seated immediately if we sat at the bar. We sat at the bar and was approached by the waitress almost instantly when we sat down and gave our order. So Far so good.... Two of us ordered salads and one ordered a bowl of soup. I ordered the roasted veggie salad with grilled shrimp. Their orders came out approx 10 minutes later. Said mine was coming soon. Waited, waited , waited...kept inquiring...same answer :Soon!""  Bottom line, both my friends finished their food, paid their bills and left to see the movie before my salad even got there. When the food got there, I wolfed it down in record breaking time.

Karl K.,"Los Angeles, CA",292,374,3671,3.0,1/11/2014,"Tasty lunch... until I saw the calories! --------------------------- We came here on our afternoon stroll in Burbank. Â This being the new year, we decided to try to keep our New Year's resolution. Â So we split the Avocado club appetizer, Italian deli sandwich, and half a Moroccan salad. Â  Avocado club appetizer - this was, admittedly, VERY delicious. Â Three egg rolls, halved, and stuffed with avocado, cheese, and bacon bits. Â Very savory. Â It comes with two dipping sauces, which look like thousand island + ranch (I am not sure, since I was trying desperately to not to overload on calories) Italian deli sandwich - salami, pepperoni, and maybe capicola on a focaccia roll, with crisp iceberg lettuce and shredded parmesan cheese. Â This was served with a pea + barley soup. The sandwich was quite delicious. Â Perfect combination of salty, savory, crispy, and crunchy bread. Â The soup was also pretty tasty. Â  Moroccan salad, half - this was a bit dry (which was actually a blessing; see below). Â This was otherwise a refreshing mix of iceberg lettuce, dates, cranberries, nuts, and seasoned chicken. Â We couldn't quite tell what the seasoning was, because there was very little dressing. Â   So you would think, with this sensible spread between the two of us, we would be ahead of the game, right? Â NOPE. Â According to their own website (  ), this lunch works out to 1500 calories per person. Â Out of 2000 calories daily allotment. Â WOW. Just imagine if we each got an appetizer, entree, drink, maybe even a half salad ""just to be healthy."" Â No wonder 2/3 of America is overweight or obese. Oy vey.

I called a couple weeks beforehand to reserve/'call ahead' since we had a party of 18 and it was no problem.  I ordered a couple appetizers, two each of two different salads, and eight pizzas altogether for the whole party as to alleviate some of the stress of 18 people ordering 18 different things and to help expedite the kitchen. Everything was brought out timely and hot and we all left with full tummies and lots of to-go boxes. Our server, Go, was totally charming and on top of things the entire evening.  The star of the dinner (besides the birthday celebrant himself, of course) was the red velvet cake! Ohmygoodness. We opted to just have the restaurant provide the birthday cake, instead of worrying about picking one up somewhere else or bringing one from home. Such a good idea, cuz damn, I am never baking a red velvet cake ever again!!! The frosting was super light and creamy and the cake was fluffy and moist and... my mouth is watering, lol.  Docking a star because while sitting on the patio, we were treated to the dumpster getting emptied and a lady selling plastic roses. Get a gate to block the sidewalks, please! That street corner is so busy, too! We had a couple little kids toddling around and were alarmed to realize there was no gate separating the restaurant patio from the sidewalk.

So this evening being like many others I wanted CPK for dinner and decided to save myself the drive and have it delivered. After searching the various delivery apps turns out Door Dash was the one working with CPK. I placed my order for two salads and used the special request section to request bread butter and olive oil for each, then I called the restaurant to confirm the order had been received as entered which it had. The delivery arrived about 15 minutes soon than estimated which of course was great. However the young man who came to the door and immediately apologized that the restaurant does not bag the food in a restaurant take out bag which is simply not acceptable ad this creates a sanitary issue as the door dashers bag is used numerous times a day and food items should not be placed directly into the drivers bag. Not to mention that because and initial packing of the order is not done the food shift quite a bit and the presentation upon delivery is NOT appealing and of course the bread and butter were not included.

I had coffee to drink but there were no teaspoon for stirring, our waiter/barman was so busy with other customers, so I tried to get the attention of the cashier who was in front of me, but she was ignoring me, and when I finally had her attention, I asked if they have stirrer so I can stir my coffee? She told me we don't have here and just proceeded doing what she was doing! No biggie right? I used my knife to stir my coffee, then finished my dinner and chill a little bit.. This girl went for a break or something, another girl who was helping her replaced her at the counter, she was, while doing her work was also chatting with another girl and the chatter went on and on, then a male waiter came and asked her for a to-go salad, the waiter asked her about 3 or 4 times, and she just kept on chatting with the other girl, completely ignoring the waiter! WTF! I looked at the waiter and told him ""at least we were not the only one being ignored"" and we laughed about it! At that moment the girl finally realized that somebody is asking her for a salad, her response to the waiter was ""you know I can't do 3 things at once""! WTF! Why don't you shut up and just concentrate on your work! CPK when you hire people, let them know that they will be in a customer service, no matter if you are a waiter, barman, cook, chef etc. they are still in a restaurant! Customers go out to spend money, at least give them good enough experience to go out for and have their money's worth! Too much self entitlement is not good! Oh our barman service was excellent, kept on coming back and asking if we need anything? The waiter was nice too, he cleaned our side of the bar even if it's not his station!

Â I will think not just once, but several times before returning here however. Â I met a friend at this CPK for lunch yesterday and the main problem we had here was dirty dishes and silverware. Â  It all started with my water glass which had food stuck to the edge of the glass where one would drink from if you weren't using a straw. Â Our server kindly replaced it with what I can now only hope and pray was a clean glass - at least, it looked clean. Â Then, we reached for our bread plates, and one of them had food stuck to it as well. Â Our server kindly replaced that, too. Â I ordered the Lunch Duo of soup and a half sandwich - my soup spoon had food stuck to both sides of it! Â At this point, I was the one actually embarrassed to ask our server for another spoon. Â He went and got me another one and would you believe it, that had food stuck to it, too! Â If I hadn't been starving at that point, I might have left. Â I asked another server to bring me yet another spoon, and at long last, that one was ok. Â But seriously, where's OSHA? Â  Â  Things went fine as my friend and I ate our meals - those at least tasted good, but the entire time I was by then paranoid that I was most likely eating out of filthy dishes. Â Once the trust is gone, it's gone. Â Our server came by to check on us and asked us about dessert. Â However, after we turned down dessert, our server disappeared. Â We had to wait around a good 30 minutes just to pay our bill, and the lunch crowd had mostly gone by that time since it was past 2 pm. Â I had a work meeting post-lunch and was late to it because of this. Â  I don't see myself returning to this place, and I advise all you wise Yelpers to go to another CPK location if you can.

The complimentary bread is now baguette style and served warm with olive oil with seasonings?! So glad for this change from the slices of stale white sandwich bread with cubes of butter. The pizza boxes are nicer too.  Our food was delivered all at the same time, the waitress came by and checked on us several times and refilled our drinks, and the food was overall good.  I had the spicy chipotle chicken pizza that came with a side of cilantro cream - a new diversion for me from my usual Thai pizza. The waitress got me extra sauce to take home with my leftover pizza.

I should also mention that I asked for the bread and to join the Pizza Dough promotion in advance over the phone.

I've never enjoyed this place, but stopped tonight out of convenience. It never fails to disappoint.  Their two bread options were herb cheese or herb onion focaccia. Maybe you don't want that. So you decide to substitute white bread. Waitress looks a little dumbfounded. This isn't rocket science. We don't want herb anything nor focaccia.  Dude...the sandwich came unassembled. When I looked at the waitress and said ""What is this?"" It looked completely normal to her. Made me feel like an alien for having any rational sense. No sauce on in, but mayo on the side. 4 slices of bread strewn on the plate and the innards of a club sandwich tossed on the plate resembling a heap of a mess. Hence, the WTF!  I'm sorry, but if this is how you serve a customer a Club Sandwich for substituting the bread then you've got to be missing a screw. I wasn't sure if the kitchen/staff were being sarcastic or not. Kind of offended though. It was just overall fucking weird. I still look at the picture and can't make much sense out of it. For the overpriced food in here you expect a little bit more effort. She said this is the only white bread they have. You can't even complain because you know you'll get it back with spit and boogers in it.  My mushroom, pepperoni, sausage pizza was a bit soggy. I make oven heated, frozen pizzas at home that I enjoy more. I am dumbfounded as to the popularity of this place. The quality of food is mediocre to just bad.

Jasmine C.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,16,11,1.0,8/1/2014,"Probably the worst California Pizza Kitchen I have ever dined at. Now, bear with me. I'm not a California native. I guess I had high expectations eating at a CPK in California. Believe me when I tell you that the service, food, and sanitation was absolutely disappointing. While ordering our lunch, we decided to have some bread to start off with and boy was it a lot! Two small pieces for two people. What a great appetizer if you ask me. Now this part really gets: the service. The girl serving us is actually going to be the reason why I will never come back. She never bothered to come by to refill our drinks. If we needed something, we had to get up out of our seats and approach her. I would understand that if she was busy, it'd be hard to get around to us. I would've pitied her. Does that mean I can't receive some decent service from a waitress who is too busy walking around? Why is it my job to literally get up off my seat to get a new knife because the one that seemed to come so neatly wrapped had some weird leftover lettuce stuck to it? Now here's to the food. My all time favorite Spicy Chipotle Chicken pizza will never be the same. All the other CPKs that I've eaten at have done a pretty good job in making the Spicy Chipotle Chicken appetizing; here, it was not the case. The pizza was so dry that I was almost tempted to ask the waitress for some more sauce that came with the pizza...but then again, I would have to get up so what's the point, right? The nicely stacked, pile of corn and veggies that was supposed to be in the center of the pizza was nowhere to be seen. In fact, I don't even remember if there was any corn for that matter. Why serve me a pizza that looks nothing like the one advertised? Overall, the food wasn't bad, but I did have high expectations.  Now, the check. As I've mentioned before, the waitress was either always walking, standing, or doing nothing and yet it was so hard to get her attention in the midst of what seemed like a busy day for her. I ended up getting out of my seat...AGAIN after waiting 15 minutes to ask for a check. The only thing I really liked about this place was that the girl who seated us was really friendly. It made us feel comfortable and happy to eat there...until of course, we started getting the service or lack there of if I should say.

Jennifer S.,"North Hollywood, CA",0,18,,4.0,7/11/2015,"OK, CPK, you and I have been friends for a long time but I've got a bone to pick with you. Remember a long time ago when you discontinued the Tandoori Chicken pizza, and I was really sad? I've grown to accept this loss. Then there was the absence of the garlic shrimp pizza, an indulgence I enjoyed on occasion, but I could live without. But now, OH BOY, now you've gone TOO FAR, CPK. You've discontinued the tiramisu. You are FREAKING KIDDING me, right? This is your SIGNATURE dessert! You had the most unique tiramisu in the world, we ordered it EVERY TIME, no matter who I came with. Dinner, lunch, whatever time of day, our meal ended with the delivery of our favorite treat: rich, Sabayon marscarpone sauce, our delicious, decadent dessert proudly perched within this pool of yummy sweetness. It's in your cookbook for crying out loud, doesn't that mean anything?? How can you discontinue the tiramisu??  Formal protest. I am wounded. We came in tonight and had a very nice meal, David was our server and he was a very good waiter. The remodel is fine, though why you decided to exchange the back booths for the bench/chair hybrid tables is beyond me, makes no sense and is awkward (why would you have one party with their back to the storefront window and the other facing it? Awkward light for one person facing the window wall and bad feng shui for the diner in the chair, bad move, store designer!)  But this I can forgive and it won't stop me from coming in (though it will make me picky about where I sit.) But the menu change is kind of a deal-breaker.  You need to bring that tiramisu back, CPK. There's no other dessert on the menu like it, nor is there one worth replacing it. Very sad. Totally changing the dining experience for a lot of people who have been loyal to you for a lot of years.

I don't think I've ever written a review for a specific employee before but Jake sure deserves it. I really hope his manager sees this and acknowledges him. My food was great as expected. The fettuccini is basically like mini fajitas with green pasta, I add pepper on mine. We also tried the Club pizza (I think that's what it's called) and that was delicious too. It's basically inspired by a club sandwich, I was a bit iffy at first because it's basically a bacon pizza with salad on top, it can get a bit messy so you have to hold it like a taco but it's really really good.

I felt like there wasn't enough dressing on the salad, it definitely wasn't the best Cesar Salad I've had and I probably won't order it again.

Now I go, sometimes I'll sit alone, and I order the garlic cream fettuccine. I substitute the fettuccine for the penne simply because the shape of penne holds more of the garlic cream sauce. I've also had the spinach artichoke dip, spinach artichoke and chicken pizza, and the salmon on a wooden plank. I would have to say all of these dishes are extremely delicious. if you're looking to have left overs for the next day I recommend you eat all the bread that you can and get yourself the artichoke pizza.

Ailyne H.,"Valencia, CA",665,447,2370,2.0,7/29/2013,"I dined here last Saturday night. Let me start by saying it took me a few days to post this review as when I drafted this, my blood was boiling! I really wanted this review to have a fair rating so waited a few days to cool off.... With that said, I arrived at CPK around 9pm on a Sat night. I was tired and looking forward to unwinding. I almost opted to sit at the bar as there was no wait but decided to wait the 10 mins for a table, whichwas about 10 mins more or less. The hostess showed us to our table, right next to the hostess stand - totally fine. I looked at the table and immediately saw it was dirty: water rings from previous glasses, crumbs and a hair (yuck!) which I mentioned and pointed out. The hostess gave me ""this look"" like I was being prissy and placed her finger on top of the hair and dragged it off the table slow and exaggerated, which was followed by a pointed stare back to me and dead silence. Okay, I don't know what planet she came from but that was definitely NOT COOL. I've dined at plenty of eateries, high end, low budget, hood, to schamncy and never have I experienced that kind of rude, blatant attitude. I was dumbfounded. then REALLY mad! Rather than succumb to a full-blown confrontation, I decided to keep my ladylike composure and sat down. We placed our order and I skipped out on wine because I was silently fuming on the inside and didn't feel like unwinding at all anymore. Anyway, our server Tiffany, was great and very friendly. Polite, attentive, great attitude - she was the silver lining to my dreary experience and compensated for the manners the hostess was lacking.. The venue itself was loud, busy, the usual at any CPK location. Food was up to par with my usual visits to CPK. We finished up our meal and while the BF was waiting for the food to be boxed, I made my way over to the manager station in the back. Mike, the manager on shift, noticed my milling about and promptly came over to inquire if I needed anything. I proceeded to explain the unpleasant event that unfolded earlier and did my best to remain cool, calm and collected. I noticed a lot of the staff around us looked alarmed and were trying to eavesdrop on what was happening, but I wasn't trying to make a big deal out of it. I merely wanted to state the facts and inform the manager of the bad attitude of one of his hostesses. I also asked for the contact information to the corporate office, which the manager provided me with. He did try to reassure me that he would address this matter with that employee ASAP and I appreciated his gesture. Anyway, I took the business card, said good night and made my way out. This experience was a total turn off and locked away in the memory bank. Not sure if I feel up for returning to this location in the future. I really could have made my own salad and saved myself some money, but chose to dine out for the experience, which means service is part of that, not just the food.

They have outstanding pizza and pretty good chicken too. Plus, they have nice appetizers. My drinks are alright, although there was a time my root beer tasted like chocolate milk.

Hailey Z.,"Glendale, CA",301,626,508,3.0,4/2/2012,"Yet another awesome restaurant chain that's going down the tubes. At least in my opinion.  It had been a few years since I'd dined here last and things have just....changed. Not for the better but whatever.  Parking is free unlike the Glendale location. I don't care if it's free 90 min parking there, we all know we stay there longer than that. Parking is okay here unless it's super busy, then it really is a drag.  Don't ever sit in the back near the revolving door that leads to the patio. Everyone loves walking in and out of that door, and it's cold!  Since when does a restaurant charge for fresh Parmesan cheese?! If I'm gonna spend more than ten bucks for one of your over priced pizzas or pastas, I'd like to have real Parmesan cheese on that. Not the processed Kraft brand that they put in a shaker. I think that's so damn tacky.  Bread is brought upon request. I get that because a lot of people don't eat any and they can't reuse it. But if you're gonna bring bread to my table make sure it's fresh. My mom and I had one slice each and nixed the rest of it.  Peach iced tea was soooo good. It's already sweetened but it still needs a bit more sweetener and a few lemons. I really enjoyed it.  I got the chopped chicken pizza. Also really liked that, but didn't like the dollar extra for the Parmesan.  When this place is really busy don't count on getting too much from your waiter. At least we didn't from ours. The manager really had to help him out, I sort of got a weird vibe from him that my request for a refill was really taking him out of his way.  Maybe I just came on a bad day, who knows. You can't say that their food lacks quality and isn't really good. Maybe better luck next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-burbank?start=180

Mia I.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,3,,5.0,9/1/2015,"I recently visited along with my family of 16. We were celebrating a birthday. And while I had called a week ahead to see if they took reservations they told me they did not. But they were very helpful and told me to call 2 hrs prior to the time we wanted to arrive and that they would Â do their best to accommodate us. Well, they were right on point. I waited all of 10 minutes max before they had our table ready. We were waited on by Tilley. She was very nice and sweet. She was a real pleasure. Her ""woops"" moment and I'm putting that lightly based on the expression on her face was when she accidentally spilled a Coke on me. Poor thing, she was absolutely mortified with herself about it. It was something out of a movie scene. But it had actually just happened to me!! It was truly an accident and I guess I could have reacted upset or made a scene about it given that I was wearing a white pair of pants and a corral top, but for what!? I didn't want to make her feel worse than she already did. They were very attentive and brought me everything possible to help clean me up and make me feel less sticky. The manager immediately came over and asked that I please bring him the receipt for the dry cleaning and they would take care of it. He also comped our table with spinach dip enough for all my guests, which was delicious, as well as comping my dish. After the whole spilling incident Tilley continued to take care of my guests and I amazingly. She had no trouble what so ever tending to all 16 of us all on her own and with no other wait staff's assistance. I could go on and on about our entire experience but in a nutshell, great service!!

One plus is when the people waited a server came around and offered BBQ Thai pizza so we don't get all grumpy I guess. Good Job on that. And the hostess made sure we were not forgotten since everyone else was being seated. They were just making room for a table for 5. And she also apologized when we left. Thank you!

Darya J.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",32,7,4,1.0,9/30/2011,"I usually go to the CPK in Simi Valley but since I've moved this is the closest one to my place.  The night I came to this specific CPK, it was about an hour and a half till closing. As soon as I stepped in the door the host had my boyfriend and I wait a few minutes while they figured out where to sit us. I absolutely never have an issue with things like this, but I did this time. We waited for about 5 minutes and there were OPEN tables and booths all around the restaurant ! There were about 8 other tables dining in. So first of all, are you serious? I could of guessed which section was open with a server on, and sat myself. But that would of been a bit rude.  When we finally were seated, it took our server a bit to greet us. Once again, the restaurant was pretty dead, and from what I saw he was only serving one other table. When we took our order and got our drinks we didn't see our server for another 20 minutes until the food came out. This was an issue because my boyfriend ordered one of their signature lemonades , can't recall the name of it but anyway it was nasty. Our server then dropped off our food and before we could say anything he quickly walked away. He did not even return to see if our meals came out okay, which they did not because they were borderline cold/luke warm like it had been sitting in the window for 10 minutes.  When our server finally noticed we were finished, he stopped by. This was the only time he gave us any type of service because he was processing our check. He asked if the lemonade thing was okay, and we let him know we didn't like it. He took it off the check and asked if my boyfriend would like to have something else (which was pointless because we were done eating). Â After we denied, he promptly boxed our food and processed our check and said his goodbyes with a big smile. (First smile of the night by the way.)  In conclusion, I will definitely not be back to this location !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-burbank?start=240

Vic S.,"St Paul, MN",6,30,36,2.0,2/8/2015,"Unfortunately, these franchise restaurants all have a razor thin profit margin so they have to get a boat load of people in the restaurant at any given time thus overwhelming the service staff as was the case with this particular CPK. I went in sat night opened the door and the first thing I notice was the noise. Â Plates clanking, spots TV blasting, wait staff running around and very loud conversation by the overcrowding of guest. Â So when I saw this I decided not to over task the staff and get the heck out so I ordered to go. Â About 30 minutes later the food order showed up. Now I expected this and was not the least bit perturbed about it. Â But the bottom line is this: Â most franchise places like CPK; quality of service decrease exponentially with and increase of customers represented by the following formula: Â (q2+s)-(Cx*T)= q of S. I think the bigger message is : we have reached a point in this country where Profit Â comes before People and it has strongly filtered down from the halls of congress to the doors of the restaurants.

Have not had it for a while so decided to have it again a couple of weeks ago.... Here is my latest take on CPK...  Pizza still as tasty as before, so I got to give it up for that... however, ordered a Linguini pasta dish and it totally seemed like the place has ran out of food. I remember a year ago the portions at CPK were fairly significant, however, this time around I guess the economy has hit them hard so the portion definitely shrunk quite a bit... Being a big eater I find that by paying $13 or so for a pasta dish that probably fill me up for a couple of hours is just not gonna do. So maybe I'll get the pizza from now on if I go.

Stephy S.,"San Francisco, CA",5000,2603,1054,4.0,5/20/2007,"It's a CPK. It's about as corporate as it gets. I once interviewed for a job at a CPK my last year of college and I lasted about 13 minutes into training seminar one as they explained how exact everybody's uniform and tie had to be. Umm, no thanks. WIth that said, when embarking on an Ikea mission on a Saturday and your only other option is the Burbank mall's food court or Chevy's, well CPK looked like an awesome bet and so we went with it. We were greeted by our very nice server who called us easy. Normally I would be offended, I mean, who's he been talking to and who's ass do I need to kick for sharin stories, but in this case, my friend and I were easy as we ordered the exact same salad, the exact same way and the exact same Arnold Palmer. Easy Peasy. We then ate our half orders of Steak House Salads (and can I just say for the record that calling something a Steak House salad is a little misleading. I mean shouldn't it have steak? I thought it should have, but I guess since Steak Houses serve salads, that gives them the right. I can't wait to try their Korean BBQ salad with just greens, yummy yum, what?) We then ate our salads and didn't even touch the free bread and butter and after turning down the dangling carrot that is, ""Would you ladies like some dessert?"" we were on our way to the hell that is Ikea. The good thing about this place is that they get you in and out and if all you are craving is a salad or a corporate pizza, then it's fine.

Â I finally gave in and decided to go to the California Pizza Kitchen. Â I figured it would be an upgrade from Pizza Hut (I'd say Little Caesars, but let's be serious here. Â That's $5 cardboard, not pizza). So my boyfriend and I went in, and the place was bright and upbeat. Â Family friendly, but nice enough where you wouldn't be bothered by running/screaming kids or awful music. Â We settled down at a booth and decided on the Vegetarian with Japanese eggplant on a honey wheat crust. Â We also replaced the usual tomato sauce with a mushroom walnut pesto sauce. It came out light, crispy, and delicious. There veggie/cheese ratio was well balanced. Â The vegetables were neither too crunchy or too soft. Â The cheese was thick and melty enough to do that stringy-cheese thing when you pull away from your bite. Â I think replacing the tomato sauce was a good idea. Â The tomato might overwhelm the subtle flavors of the brocollini and eggplant. Â  CPK cured my pizza craving and I didn't feel guilty about it after wards. Â The service was polite, prompt, and helpful. Â It's good place to go to share a pie, or two pies even. Â It's cool to go once in a while, but I wouldn't recommend it for a weekly excursion.

Andy C.,"Burbank, CA",17,40,1,4.0,12/2/2013,"I for some reason see CPK as an upscale Denny's...maybe I'm just crazy. But that doesn't mean that CPK doesn't make for a decent lunch or dinner. The environment is clean, well-kept, and noise levels are what one expects at a family restaurant. I've noticed recently the CPK's across SoCal have been attempting to 'de-chain' themselves: matching uniforms are no longer required, gone are the cookie-cutter black booths from some restaurants. This gesture I feel is a step in the right direction, which is conducive to a better experience overall.  The food has gotten better over the years quality-wise, and I think CPK's new crust which they introduced this year took their pizzas to the next level. I feel the crust is the most important part of the pizza, and CPK successfully transitioned from the chewy, tasteless dough surrounding the pizza to an airy, crispy complement to the pizza. The appetizers are diverse and taste decent; I usually order the rolls and dumplings. For the entrees, I wolf down either a Margherita or Sicilian pizza, two thin-crust pizzas which I feel are the most refined pizzas on CPK's menu. Regarding pastas, the Kung Pao Spaghetti and Fettucine Alfredo are at the top of my list. The Kung Pao keeps the heat at a tolerable yet invigorating level, and doesn't overload on the saltiness. The peanuts have a slightly roasted flavor and texture, which are welcome as I eat the pasta. The Fettucine Alfredo also earns praise; the sauce is perfectly creamy, and the noodles cooked well.  Overall, a good family restaurant that's reliable to fill you with a decent meal that's well worth the money",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-burbank?start=260

Back then, I was an avid fan of the Pek King Duck Pizza. I guess not many people were on the same wagon as I, so CPK decided to kick it to the curb. Now, as boring as it may sound, I'm into the original BBQ Chicken Pizza. Thin pizza and not over-bearing crust just seems perfect to me. The other night, I dined here with a friend. I decided to go a little different and not order my usual pizza. I ordered the Jambalaya. It wasn't too bad even though I was expecting it to be over rice and not pasta. Maybe they should make it where you have an option? Scratch that, probably a pain in a butt to add options. It's not my favorite Jambalaya but I didn't dislike it. There was a fair amount of shrimp in it too. My friend had the Waldorf Salad. I didn't see anything great about it all. If I had to choose with salads, I rather go with their Oriental Chicken Salad instead. For you Barley/Split Pea Soup lovers, it's not bad here. I know Split Pea Soup looks like something spewing out of the Linda Blair's mouth in the Exorcist but looks can be deceiving. I had it with the half/half soup bowl of Corn Chowder which I didn't think was all that great. My friend wanted that soup so I told her let's go 1/2-1/2 to make it fair. For a party of two, expect to pay about $40 for dinner including tip. You can't go wrong with CPK not unless you are experiencing one of those rare times when everything seems to go wrong.

A simple would have been more efficient. Our bread was of low quality and our chicken wings appetizer were the sorriest we have ever seen. Seriously, 4 wimpy almost inedible cold pieces for $5.50? I seriously could buy something better from the supermarket. Our pizza came lukewarm and asked to have it reheated. And to finish it off, after asking for our check, he brought the wrong check. He was constantly throwing things at us. As a server, you must show the game face and even if you are busy, don't let the customers know. It wasn't even busy, this is why his behavior was very odd.

Take out here is truly a breeze.

If you actually want to walk into the restaurant to pick up your food (and therefore fulfill your five minutes of exercise for the day) instead of having them bring it out to you, parking is easy as there is a parking lot right next door.

Joseph Y.,"Chatsworth, CA",5000,701,692,4.0,2/11/2013,"I think CPK have mastered the art of pizza! They consistently deliver delicious items. My favorite is the tostada pizza and probably the healthiest of them all too! Prices are reasonable considering the pizza size is so big. My tostada cost me $13 with chicken, but its almost impossible to eat, unless you are my size!  The service is always to notch. Attentive greeters, waiters and waitress' are consistent with their business model. The place is always clean and busy. Which leads me to their only flaw...the unusual wait times. Considering this particular location is next to Ikea, I understand the prospect of wait times, but even when I go to the one in Valencia or Woodland Hills I always encounter the same thing...waiting.

Vvn W.,"Van Nuys, CA",63,546,30,3.0,8/31/2010,"You can't get anymore corporate than CPK when it comes to pizza! Â Their pizzas seem to follow a certain basic recipe and no deviations are allowed. Â Don't even think about substitutions; whatever is on the menu, that's what you're getting. Â However with that said, CPK seem to draw a huge crowd no matter what time of the day. Â I've never been to a CPK where I was seated immediately or not bump elbows with fellow patrons. With its enormous popularity and varieties of different artsy pies, their pizzas are surprisingly just average. Â If you're looking for gourmet pizza, this place isn't it. Â No doubt that CPK is creative but some pizzas just miss the mark in taste. Â I had their ""new"" roasted artichoke and spinach pizza on honey wheat crust recently and it taste like roasted artichoke and spinach on cardboard. Â The crust was dried out and tasteless. Â I was totally unimpressed. Â If I were going to pick out my favorite, it would be the Thai chicken pizza, which was very flavorful and kind of made you forget that you're eating a pizza. It's really a hit n' miss with CPK. Â Some pizzas (basic ones like cheese, pepperoni, veggies) are exceptionally good. Â But once you dabble with fancier pizza, that's where it tasted off. Â Service is average yet the restaurant is fairly clean for the amount of people that come through the doors. Â It's good for large parties and does promote a fun environment.

Christina R.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,42,,4.0,6/23/2012,"CPK is one of the few chain restaurants that I will eat at.  I admit that I am a bit of a food snob though I will eat at a 5 Star restaurant as well as a dive & anywhere in between so long as the food is good.  My favorite here is the  Wild Mushroom Pizza Â  on Honey Wheat Crust w/ Sun Dried Tomatoes  Cremini, Shiitake, Portobello, White Mushrooms, Fontina, Mozzarella cheeses w/ a wild mushroom walnut pesto, garnished with chopped Italian parsley to which I add a ton of crushed red peppers & enjoy with a glass or 2 of Pinot Grigio. I love this pizza so much that I never order anything else!!! I am quite picky about my pizza, being from Manhattan aka New York & I do give a thumbs up.  There was one manager who was very friendly & made sure that everyone was happy. I didn't see him the last time that I was there. If I knew his name I would give proper credit. I love when they give you the coupons for future visits to save anywhere from 10% to 20% off food only. I've been lucky to receive these on occasion. My only advice for the waitresses/waiters would be to make sure that water glasses are filled. I know that it's a very busy job, having been a waitress for a brief time but please keep the water glass full. I always did! :-) It's not pleasant to keep asking for water or to sit there with an empty glass thirsty.  I almost always tip 20% or more but the last time I was there I left the waitress a 15% tip, which is not like me. She didn't fill our water glasses & only seemed to be around to offer dessert or other items in an obvious attempt to increase her tip. It had the reverse affect as we felt that she did not care otherwise.  Most of my experiences here are positive.  The hosts & hostesses are usually wonderful! The passion fruit mojito is delicious! Before or after, you can go shopping in the mall or to IKEA, have a margarita at Chevy's or see a movie. :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-burbank?start=300

It also didn't hurt that it's been years since I've had cpk, so I definitely wanted to be reminded how good the food is. We had an order of the baja chicken tortilla spring rolls for starters and a jerk chicken pizza for the main course. The appetizer was the best part of the meal, the guacamole it came with was awesome. Unfortunately the pizza was not that great, probably a bad selection on our choice but when we ordered the waitress added ""good choice"". It was far from it, the actual chicken isn't the problem cause it was seasoned well but the sauce ruined it, just overpoweringly sweet. If I wanted dessert on pizza I would've said so. I would not order it again and I regret not going with my first choice which was either the BBQ chicken pizza or wild mushroom. I like that they use a fairly thin crust so it isn't heavy at all. That would keep me coming back and the fact that there are so many other selections.

I ordered the asparagus & spinach spaghetti ($10.99) with an addition of shrimp ($4.50). I wasn't expecting many shrimp for that low price, but it was a surprisingly generous portion. I thought the dish tasted really good, though maybe a little too much garlic - next time I'll ask them to limit or omit it. My friend got the Thai Crunch Salad ($12.99), which she said was delicious. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. He kept the refills coming, made sure we didn't want for anything, and he didn't bug us when we chatted for awhile after dinner. Not even one evil eye.

At first the hostess was no where to be seen for a few minutes, and when she finally did show up, she didn't even acknowledge us and sat the first party. When she came back, she asked us how many people were in our party, not smile or friendly welcome at all. Then sat the other party in front of us. When we finally got sat it took our server 10 minutes to get our two waters. We also asked for bread which didn't come out until our appetizer came out. And both of the pizzas we ordered were bland. The entire time the server was absent, never asking how anything was, talking to other tables and never checking on us. We had to keep asking other servers for help. I ended up sending back my pizza (Shrimp Scampi Pizza) because there was no flavor (I know, surprise for something that sounded so good) and got the Pepperoni, Sausage, and Mushroom pizza instead. It was better, but honestly, how can you mess up something that simple. The service here is horrible and the food was bland as hell!
