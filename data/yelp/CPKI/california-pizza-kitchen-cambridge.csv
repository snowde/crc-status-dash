Jenn S.,"Needham Heights, MA",84,559,61,4.0,2/13/2010,"I hadn't eaten at CPK in years and, since September, I've been 3 times, to 3 different locations. Each time, I'm impressed with the menu (HUGE selection) and the food - which is not phenomenal, but is good, solid an dependable. On my most recent trip - to the CambridgeSide Galleria location - I was once again disappointed with the bread. A towering stack of... plain white bread. Don't do bread if you're not going to do it right! Did I eat it? Yes, but because I was hungry! My meal, however, was a different story. When the food came, everyone at the table started commenting on how all the choices looked good. I even started to question my choice of The Original BBQ Chicken Chopped (which I knew I loved): Chopped lettuce, black beans, sweet corn, jicama, cilantro, basil, crispy corn tortilla strips and Monterey Jack cheese tossed together in our herb ranch dressing. Topped with chopped BBQ chicken breast, diced tomatoes and green onions. I got the dressing (MMM) on the side and of course, added the avocado (I think it was at least $2 extra?! Another salad came with the avocado. Not happy about that charge). I also got the half size, which was PERFECT. I was full, but not painfully so. My friends went with: -   Grilled Chicken Caesar Sandwich: Marinated grilled chicken breast, shredded lettuce, sliced fresh Roma tomatoes, shaved Parmesan cheese and our Caesar dressing. Served with your choice of herb onion focaccia or garlic cheese focaccia and your choice of soup, classic Caesar salad or Szechuan slaw. (One got it with a side of the Tuscan White Bean Minestrone soup: Cannellini beans, tomatoes, zucchini, spinach, onion, celery and Parmesan cheese. Served with homemade garlic-herb croutons on the side.) - Sedona Tortilla Soup: Vine-ripened tomatoes, tomatillos and corn with mild green chilies and Southwestern spices. Served with crispy corn tortilla strips on the side. Everything looked (and apparently was) great and I once again left happy. CPK is a great place for a fun meal out - with friends, family or just your honey (not for romance though).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cambridge?start=40
lindsey g.,"Cambridge, MA",3,2,,1.0,12/19/2008,"I'll make this short and sweet: During the meal I not only spotted a mouse in the restaurant...an actual mouse ran over my FOOT. Not only was the manager not at all apologetic; he continuously blamed the malls placement of the food court and not the lack of cleanliness in his own restaurant.  I've waited tables...I know how much customers can suck. Yet it is completely outrageous to have something like a MOUSE running through the restaurant and across the extremity of a customer and not offer to at least comp their meal. I called the California Pizza Kitchen headquarters and they were appalled...offering me two free meals, still I refuse to go back. Who wants to eat in a place that not only lacks decent management, it also lacks basic cleaning skills. Beware...unless you want to contract rabies while devouring a barbequed chicken pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cambridge?start=40
Hakkku K.,"Mid-Cambridge, MA",0,3,,1.0,10/15/2012,"they suck!!! ordered for a pick up and we went there to pick up our pizza and casadia, it was only 20 minutes after we placed our ordered, first of all they did not speak to us properly and made us wait for a while even they were so slow (there were only 3 tables dining), second of all the guy at the front sent us to the pick up center and then there that girl with a broken face ( angry face ) gave us our food.  the impression was very bad, when we got home and bit the slice, there was no taste, the pizza was very cold, the veggies and meat were not that well cooked.  after all we had to suck it.

I love this place, and it's such a guilty pleasure - I take friends here for an inexpensive meal that fills you up. I don't recommend most of the pizzas besides the Toastasa (the best, by far).

Maria P.,"Bayonne, NJ",50,180,24,3.0,10/15/2010,"I was in the area for a meeting and wanted to get some lunch before hand so I ended up here. I ordered the waldorf chicken salad. It took 30 minutes to come out, it doesn't take that long to make a salad! And the waitress didn't even bother to refill my water glass or update me on why the salad was taking so long. The salad was pretty good however. Unfortunately that doesn't make up for the bad service. I paid the bill and left as quickly as I could. I don't think I'll be back here anytime soon but I might just give it another try during dinner to see if it different then.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cambridge?start=40

I wish every waitress was as good as the one we had today. We had the foccaccia bread which was good and the mac and cheese bites which were ridiculously good! I could have eaten a million of those things! Then we had the spinach and artichoke pizza with chicken which was really yummy too. We were in and out in no time which I love!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cambridge?start=40
Bailey M.,"Menlo Park, CA",56,353,40,4.0,3/20/2009,"If you love chain restaurants, CPK is one of the best. This place doesn't have any kind of homey, local pizza joint feel, but that's ok.

Jason B.,"Sandwich, MA",286,560,36,4.0,5/22/2009,"Yes, it's a chain restaurant, so let's dispense with those formalities. However, this particular CPK is a real pleasure for one reason:  Christine the Bartender. She's a beacon of friendliness in an otherwise false-politeness-what-can-i-get-for-you-sir world of dreary chain restaurant drudgery.  Christine has the wicked awesomest accent you have ever heard, and she will totally regale you with a story. She will also shut up and let you eat.  Make no mistake, the menu here is the same as it is everywhere. The pepperoni pizza is totally worth getting, the california club is absolutely not, and everything else is kind of muddled in the middle. But if you're like me, and in the C-side Gria at 7 pm with a hungry monster inside of you, a desire for a cheap pinot noir and a willingness to watch a Red Sox game with closed-caption subtitles, well look no further than the bar at this CPK.

My boyfriend and his dad and I went here the other day when we ran into his dad randomly in the mall.  What does that mean?  Lunch out with dad!  Anyway, we went here because per usual, there was a line at the Cheesecake and Jesse likes pasta and pizza.  I ordered a salad, that I believe was called the asian crunch salad with chicken, which I got with avocado.  I have a total addiction to avocado and I will admit I have a problem.  Jesse got a pasta dish, and John got a ceasar salad, and we were all content with our dishes.  My salad was a wild combination of chicken, cilantro, cabbage (red and green), peanuts, avocado, and all sorts of crunchy things....it was good and very filling for a half order.  I would suggest sticking with half orders here unless you want leftovers for the next day. I would go here again if I was in the area, but it's definitely not something to go out of your way for.....I would try the pizza since it has such mixed reviews.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cambridge?start=40

I never try anything new because I love it so much. My husband on the other hand tries new things often, and tends to love them all.

sus t.,"MA, MA",7,4,,1.0,2/24/2007,"So none of us went into this restaurant with great expectations since we've been before ages ago and didn't remember if it was any good.  Of the four pizzas we tried, there was only one half-satisfied customer at our table (with the Thai chicken). Definitely stay away from the salad pizzas. The jerk chicken was dry and the pieces were tiny.  I guess stay away from any of the ones that seem like they should be their own dish and not on a pizza. Even the standard white cheese, garlic and spinach pizza wasn't that great.  The only thing that all of us liked was the artichoke-spinach dip, but there wasn't even enough to go on half the chips.  Gave it one star because of the yummy dip- it was also a shorter wait than the Cheesecake Factory and didn't make us resort to the food court. Though now that I think about it, I would have rather spent the money at the food court and gotten dessert and a couple drinks at the Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cambridge?start=60
Amanda Y.,"Lincoln, RI",0,4,,4.0,8/5/2010,"CPK is another pizza chain restaurant. But it unlike any of it's competitors. I'm surprised I'm actually a fan because I generally dislike chain restaurants. I've only been here once so I haven't ate here enough to get a better jist of the place. I had ate the frozen pizza before and wanted to try the restaurant.  CPK has really interesting, different combos of pizza. Ones like cheeseburger, meat cravers, california club, carne asada, pear & gorgonzola, chipotle, and many more. I ordered two personal pizzas for us to share and we still took leftovers to go. The pizza is not on my top list of pizzas but it was definitely tasty. What I love about it, is the thin lightness of the pizza. It was perfectly thin and full of toppings. I hate thick pizza. I ordered a shrimp pizza that they do not carry anymore and the roasted garlic chicken. Both tasted really good. A lot of people ordered salads and they were large in size.  The restaurant was very packed and full of teenagers. Still when we arrived we got a table right away and didn't have to wait. The service was good for being so busy.

The mall was packed but the restaurant was quiet.  We got the spinach and artichoke dip and while it was good I remember it being better years ago.  Also, some of the chips seemed stale and I always feel like they give you way too many chips since you finish the dip and still have 1/2 the chips left on the plate. Anyway, I got a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and was asked if I wanted 6 or 9 ounces.  I only got 6 ounces because 9 ounces sounded like a lot.  And it was the afternoon and I knew I'd be drinking later in the day with dinner. I ended up getting the field green salad with candied walnuts, pears and a dijon vinaigrette.  The salad was good and big and I only got a 1/2 salad.  The full salad I was told was huge and I really don't feel like a Big Salad of Epic Proportions like the kind you get across the way at Cheesecake Factory. Our server was very nice and friendly and fast, her name was Anna. I always appreciate good service and we will be back very soon. The old ball and chain got the kung pao pasta and enjoyed it.  I thought it looked good but was trying to be healthy and that's why I got a salad. The price was forty something bucks and I think that's a good deal.

First one (Jambalaya fettuccine) had a piece of plastic in it. Again, it took forever to get our waiter and then to get the manager. The manager said he'll take it off our bill and said he doesn't know why it's in there. He asked us if we wanted another one or what we wanted him to do. He wasn't very apologetic. If anything he came off as rude making us feel like we were the ones overreacting.  Then  came my salad. I ate 1/3 way through the salad, when I found a receipt. It was a whole receipt at the bottom of my salad. I was so shocked that I was having palpitation and my hand started shaking. What was even more disgusting was the fact that the receipt wasnt even for our order. We had to call the manager again. He was more apologetic than the first time and again took it off our bill.  What was even more ridiculous was the fact that the manager had brought back the salad with the receipt in it and left it on our table.

Maria D.,"Cambridge, MA",82,137,11,2.0,11/30/2014,"Pro: Gluten free options Con: They serve cheese on your cheese pizzas sparingly CPK is not too far, and it's a good place for me to get a quick lunch on a weekend. However, I've run into several problems: (1) The portion options for the GF contingent (me) are just not fair. Why do I have to consume so much of a pizza when my non-Celiac friends can eat less and pay less? I don't know how other people do it, but pizza leftovers are just gross...especially when they're gluten free. Remember, people, this is not NYC, the pizza is pretty bad.  If you absolutely have to, get the Untraditional cheese. It's still pretty bad, but you will at least not have to deal with the incredibly stale 35-day old crust that they try to serve you as if it's fresh. Be not fooled, my GF buddies, this grossness can not be fresh at all.  Online ordering is easy. Pickup is easy.  But..the guacamole is also gross. Am I being very judgmental today? I think so, but I wouldn't be this way if I didn't have a reason. I've been here about 4 times, total, and I haven't had any experience that deserves more than 2 stars (and I've had some that deserve less...I think you would agree if you ended up with ingredients on your pizza that you never asked for)!  Want gluten free pizza? I'm going to keep looking. I've found some locally, but I don't recommend this to you unless you're absolutely desperate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cambridge
Kelley H.,"Boston, MA",209,35,20,2.0,2/4/2015,"The majority of the experience was ""meh"". I was seated at a four person table, which could be why the waitress was not the friendliest. Don't get me wrong, she did her job and in a timely manner but she wasn't as friendly and welcoming as waitresses often are and things felt rushed. I ordered the garlic cream fettuccine with chicken added. It looked creamy when it first arrived but soon became very dry, almost glue-like as it cooled down. The flavor also wasn't all the way there; kind of bland. The chicken was cooked fine, not too dry or anything. I will say, their desserts are great. The Tiramisu was excellent.

In fact, I was all set to give it a more favorable rating, but the last time I came here, I was lied to. And I didn't need to be.  I had ordered the pizza with whole wheat crust, and after taking my first few bites, I knew without a doubt that it was on white crust. My dinner partner had already scarfed down a few slices while I was still on my first few bites, and I just casually said, ""This isn't whole wheat."" A few chews later, said partner agreed, so I flagged down our waitress and just asked her, ""Is this whole wheat?"" To which she replied, ""Yes -- we've switched to a new wheat crust which is fluffier.""  ... Did you switch to a wheat crust that's also white? Girl, you could've just said, oh, my bad, my mistake, and that would've been fine. I mean, the pizza was already almost all gone, so it's not like I would've sent it back, but I just wanted to confirm what I already knew. Out of principle.

I particularly appreciated the open kitchen, but found the dining room itself to feel a little ""sticky"" as in the tables are not well wiped and there is little attention to detail.  But, with a staff that seems to just be learning the restaurant industry, it is probably something to be expected.  The manager was very nice and friendly, and he seemed to really set the tone for the staff because they are all very nice as well.

I never have the highest expectations for chain restaurants, but going to plenty of CPKs I enjoy the experience anyways, well usually.  Walked into the restaurant, server puts us in a table.  It takes us about 10 minutes to order, even tho we already knew what we were going to get coming in. We didn't get a waiter assigned to us, even tho the restaurant is empty.  We wave down the host, he looks at us, and then continues chatting with a waitress. haha that was just weird.  Takes us a while but we finally get water and bread, that is after asking for both on separate occassions. The food: ordered two standard items - the Sicilian pizza and the Chicken Tequila Fettucini.  Both were pretty bad in their own way.  This is the description of the Sicilian: ""sweet Italian sausage, spicy Capicola ham, julienne salami, Fontina, Mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses""  Check out the pic that I uploaded, looks more like cheese and sausage to me haha and no ham or salami.  On TOP of that, it was burned to a black crisp.  You can tell from the photo, but I wish in hindsight that I had taken a picture of the pile of burned stuff we pulled off from the pizza. For the chicken tequila, i already had my critical eye on, but i realized that there was not much of the chicken that i could find.  Being the nosy reviewer that I am, I proceeded to take every little bit of chicken and put it on the side, ending up with ...half a chicken breast? one third?  lame.  at least it still tasted like normal cpk dish.  I uploaded that pic too :)   Sigh, well I can't wait to hit up some good CPK food, just not at this location.  Seriously, this store needs to get their act together.  In fact, why even go here when there is that cheesecake factory right next door?  In fact that's what we did, after our CPK we got a nice slice of cheesecake for home :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cambridge

It's probably my own fault for not checking this out beforehand but it upsets me when chains like CPK and Cheesecake Factory manage to pull out huge numbers of calories for what seem like slightly healthy meals.  Anyway, everyone in my family enjoyed their meals and I would definitely go back for another cup of that soup. Plus, they have a pretty creative marketing scheme going on where they give you cards that contain a prize (every card has something - ranging from discounts to trips to Hawaii), but only a manager from CPK can open it on your next visit.

Unimaginable. Blasphemous, even.  But the truth must come out. I love their split pea and barley soup. It's in my top 5 soups of all time (up there with a fancy shmancy L'espalier cream soup that came with a mini savory custard). The soup is amazing. My friend who does not ingest greens or vegetables eagerly orders this soup and consumes it, green split peas and all.  My favorite salad in the world is also made here. The Moroccan salad with grilled chicken, dried dates, butternut squash, avocado, beets and champagne vinaigrette is so damn delicious, I crave it all the time and look for excuses to come to CPK for it.

CJ G.,"Grand Isle, VT",131,289,1,4.0,11/2/2010,Made such a great dinner place! CPK is awesome! Service: We quickly got seated when we came in on a Friday night! It was very nice and clean! Our server came over and got our drink orders and app and pizza order. The server was very friendly to our needs and took good care of us. Anytime a drink was low he would come by and give us a new one! He also came back to make sure the app and pizza came out the way we would have liked it too. The service was great! Food: Our app was the Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings. They came out perfect and hot just the way we like it! The dipping sauce was very good as well. I could commend this to anyone! We also got a Jamaican Jerk Chicken pizza. This over all was pretty good. The only thing about this I didn't like is it tasted like they used to much of the jerk spice. I know for some of you out there its how you like it. A little less could have made it just perfect! Now I cant knock it because when we got eating it only got better. It was just that first bite. After that it was very yummy! If you like a kick with your pizza that's not buffalo then this one is for you! Also on the plus side here the crust from this place is amazing! Not so sure it can be beat yet! Price: The app was around $7.00 and the pizza was around $13.00. So with drinks running about $5.00 for 2 it was pretty cheap for 2 to eat. There for the price was right on where I think it should be! plus we went home with left overs! Over all: I am for sure going back soon! They have service thats hard to beat and the food is just plain good! I gave it a 4 outta 5 stars becuase the pizza was good just to much jerk spice IMO. So to be fair when I go back I will re-visit it. More than likely will be a 5/5 by then. Dont shy away from this place. Its amazing! Go eat!
