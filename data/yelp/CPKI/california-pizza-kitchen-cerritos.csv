Priyanka K.,"Cerritos, CA",218,279,78,1.0,6/2/2016,"This place is on my list of places to never to visit again. The service is so bad I can't even believe it.  The host didn't smile at all and asked me more than twice whether anyone else would be joining me. No I just wanted to eat alone that day.  My server was worse though. I'm not sure the server I had understands how she sounds when she talks. She came up to me right when I was seated and said ""what do you want to eat?"" I told her I just sat down. She replied with ""uh so you're not ready yet?""  I got the Mac n cheese bites small plate and that was one of the best parts of my meal. It was very yummy.  I asked my server for hot sauce. She never brought it. When I finished my cheese bites she asked if I still wanted it.  Then my kung Pao spaghetti arrived and it tasted like pure soy sauce. I ate a couple bites and just couldn't eat any more of it. It was oily and salty and didn't have good flavor.  At that point the server just brought me my check. Without asking if I wanted dessert or if I needed anything else. And yes, I did want to get a dessert. She asked what I wanted and I said I wanted to see a dessert menu first. I got a soufflé cake and it was so delicious. But my servers attitude the whole meal was ridiculous. When she brought me the check the second time she kept telling me she would cash me out like she expected me not to pay. Is that standard procedure? To tell your customer repeatedly that they need to pay?  I even saw a guy walking around checking on people (he seems like the manager) but he didn't stop to check in on me. But checked on both tables next to me.  The cpk in Lakewood knows how to treat customers. Even though it's more out of the way, I would rather go there than return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cerritos?start=40
Esmeralda R.,"Montebello, CA",143,69,31,1.0,12/4/2016,"Called in a curbside order, they said it would take 15-20 minutes for it to be ready. We arrived 25 minutes after order was placed and parked at curbside parking area. They have a sign posted saying to call in to let them know we are outside. Called in and let them know we are waiting outside for our order, girl that answers says ok let me transfer you to curbside (even though I had pressed the correct number to speak to curbside). Puts me on hold.... 3 minutes... 5 minutes... 8 minutes... 10 minutes on hold!!!!

Roma P.,"Sacramento, CA",0,7,2,2.0,8/14/2017,Usually love eating here - kung pao spaghetti is my fav dish! However today I found hair in my spaghetti for the first time and upon telling my waitress Michelle - she said ok sorry. I wasn't expecting that reaction. I thought they will make the spaghetti again. Since nothing came forward I had to reorder the same dish and therefore ended paying double. I spent $30 on Kung pao spaghetti today.

H S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,3,1.0,7/27/2017,The Greeter ignores people as they walk in. Two other couple walked out and we were the third. As we walked in this guy said to his wife I am done lets go. I wondered why at first for there was no other people waiting to be seated and noticed another couple came around the corner to walk out as well. Finally this girl comes up to us and says there is a 15 minute wait to sit outside yet there was hardly any people out there. Get your employees right for they represent your company. Send them next door to Lazy Dog restaurant to see how they treat customers. You guys give CPK a bad name.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cerritos?start=40

As I was eating my soup I noticed it was turning blue I turned the spoon around and there was a melted crayon all over the spoon. So I spoke to a manager Nesha Horn who is helping out the Cerritos location.

She asked if we wanted bread we said yes another 10 mins went by again. We had to ask the Host for our waitress she was no where to be found.

So I literally just stood there ... waiting... for no reason until another waiter came by to ask if I was helped already and he just made her seat me.

Joan B.,"Long Beach, CA",0,11,15,1.0,9/23/2017,"Im writing this review for the lady in front who gave us seats tonight at 8:57 pm Sept 23,2017.  She's tall, black, and shes pretty rude. We came in and she stared at us for almost 3mins. Just blank stare... like she doesn't want any customers to come in anymore.(they close at 10:30 tonight,)then, she showed us to our seats and I asked her if our server will take a while because we have a movie to catch, she answered No, plain ""No"",then she walked out. We waited 10mins but no server arrived to take our order so we just left. I dont know if she's going thru something or if she doesn't want to work anymore, but staff like her shouldn't be assigned in the front, she's super grumpy. Bad attitude bad customer service.

Faith P.,"Cerritos, CA",86,2,,1.0,7/7/2017,"DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU WANT TO GET RIPPED OFF. Came here for lunch with my coworkers after a movie and all we got was horrible service bot from the staff member and the manager. When we got the bill, we placed $60 cash and placed the rest on the card. When we got the receipt, we saw that the card was charged double the amount it should have been charged (our bill was $77 and since we put down $60 in cash, the card should only be charged $15). So we asked the server and he said that we only put down $41. The server then tried to blame our coworkers for taking the money. Long story short, we did not get an apology from the manager and the server. To management,  1) why are you hiring thieves? Make sure you teach your staff to keep their tip money and the bill money separate. 2)your so called manager is very unprofessional. No apologies whatsoever. 3) please install cameras on the floor to keep this thing from happening to others.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cerritos?start=20

Steve S.,"Orange County, CA",1954,1200,7589,4.0,4/30/2016,"I've been here numerous times.  I really like CPK's pizza, salad & pasta.  It's consistently good This time around, we tried their other entrée meal (not pizza, salad or pasta).  Fire Grilled Ribeye - ""12oz usda choice ribeye grilled with housemade pinot noir sea salt and topped with creamy bleu cheese butter. Served with roasted fingerling potatoes and lemon-garlic wild arugula salad"" Surprisingly Good! It's thinner than what I usually get, but the temp and taste was spot on. I love the bleu cheese butter, yum!! Hearth Roasted Halibut - ""Wild caught alaskan halibut roasted on a cedar plank with grilled asparagus and butternut squash farro & baby kale"" the salmon was good, but the other components of this dish shined the brightest. The butternut squash and farro were outstanding. It elevated this ho hum dish to yum, yum, YUM!!  My other favorites here: Jerk Chicken Pizza The Original BBQ Chicken Pizza Pear Gorgonzola Pizza Chicken Tequila Fettuccine Dog friendly! Seating in the patio.  Service was very good. When our four legged son get's water before we do, I love it. Our waitress was super helpful and patient with us  FYI - I really liked the patio seating here. They have a glass wall. You can't smell the cigarette smoke while you're eating. Lazy Dog next door is also dog friendly and has a patio (no wall), but we were constantly down wind from the cigarette smoke, no bueno for me. CPK get's the nod for smoke free patio experience.  Price for the entrées were very pricey (compared to the pizza, pasta & salad) but worth it for the quality and taste.  Trying a new thing at an old standby joint I like and it paid off. Great service and good food will bring me back =)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cerritos?start=20
Rai J.,"Tustin, CA",0,56,9,1.0,8/28/2017,"This place is going down in quality while the portions are getting smaller and prices are as expensive as ever. Had a bad experience with a bug in my food; management offers to replace it but when I go, no one in the front is aware of me picking up the re-order and I had to go back and forth multiple times, waiting for the manager to come out and fix the issue.  Overall the food quality has been going down for a while; people in Socal really deserve better food for these prices. I just went on a road trip across the US and let me just say every state has better food at much cheaper prices. They don't charge you an arm and a leg just to cook a decent meal.

Rodney S.,"Cerritos, CA",4925,799,5561,4.0,3/30/2016,"C.U.P = Yuck! C.P.K = Yum! Free small plate for Pizza Dough Rewards members   Not being a frequent customer of California Pizza Kitchen, I can count the number of times I've visited on one hand.  However, I've always been happy with the food I've had here.   Thanks to the avant garde imagination of Ed LaDou, who first made a name for himself at Wolfgang Puck's Spago, CPK offers up very non-traditional styles of pizza, along with pasta & other bites.  The Cerritos Mall location has been a longstanding tenant throughout the years, affording an opportunity for mall goers in search of more sophisticated fare.   The Original BBQ chicken is what first made CPK famous.  For newbies, this is what I recommend first.  I've also enjoyed the roasted garlic chicken, the Thai chicken & the Jamaican jerk chicken.  My absolute fav would have to be the roasted garlic & artichoke.  Simple, elegant & mouth-wateringly good.  I don't eat artichoke very often, so having this reminds me how great that vegetable is.   I've had the spinach artichoke dip appetizer and I melted with the first bite.  Gooey, rich & great to share, this is not one to pass up.   The plate I chose to redeem for my free small plate was the white corn guacamole.  Avocado, sweet white corn, black beans, jicama, bell pepper, cilantro & serrano peppers.  The guacamole was less in quantity than I would've liked, and consisted more of the white corn kernels where, I believe, more avocado would've been ideal.  Nevertheless, it was creamy & delicious.     CPK has lunch duos to attract the lunch crowd.  A full bar with libations of various sorts for those looking for a tipple.     A good amount of seating inside, with booths & bar seating.  Al fresco dining for those looking for some fresh air.  The take-out area is on the left of the restaurant.  Service has been quick & efficient all the times I've visited.   Parking is at the eastside of the Los Cerritos Center.  California Pizza Kitchen is one of the better quality chains to dine at.  Interesting menu selections, good service & convenient location will always keep CPK as a potential place to eat when I'm debating what culinary stop I want to hit up next.

I ordered curbside cause we actually had a few stops to make and rather than have to unload everyone just to pick up food, it was easiest. So I thought.  I called to let them know I was here. There weren't any open curbside spots either so I let the guy know I'm 2 spots down. I even waited in the street so I could see him.  Well 8 minutes later he calls and says he didn't see me. Hmm maybe cause he never came out! I said well I could meet you in the street again and he said okay. I waited and nothing. So I went in. He said all the spots are open. Really?! Cause they're not.

Every time I come here there is probably some sort of new item. Be it a drink or a food item. I have never been to this location until recently. It's located inside the mall and is very close to Lazy Dog. While walking inside I wasn't able to tell where the front of the place is and the servers were very busy during lunch.  After a few minutes a server told us we weren't standing in the right area and that it would be a few minutes before we could get seated.  Got seated and it was again another wait before the sever took our order. Overall I just felt like we were waiting for everything and even for our bill!  The pizza that we got though, was pretty good. If you do come here just be warned that you might have to wait awhile.

I used to work at the mall and CPK was my go-to on my lunch break.  So fast forward to Friday and I was so excited! The visit started off well. I ordered a hot tea and we placed our orders for BBQ chicken salad and roasted veggie salad. 20 minutes later, my tea was empty and we still had no salads. Our waiter comes by and says our appetizers were served to the wrong table and would be out shortly. What appetizers? Where are our salads dude? He looks really confused and comes out less than a minute later with our salads. Cold. The best part about the CPK salads is that they are warm. I had him remake mine.  We didn't see him again. We had to flag down other people to get our check, then to run our credit cards. My poor hot tea was never refilled. The salads were subpar and not nearly as good as I remember. Ugh.

The BBQ chicken pizza was just ok, I'd go for the Thai pizza.  The banh Mi Bowl was just ok, I'd rather buy a banh mi for a fraction of the price of the bowl that was just mediocre.

It was everyone's favorite of the night.  I saw that it was new on their menu but I really hope it stays on the menu!  It was a tad salty but eat it with some pizza or free bread. Skip the banh mi bowl.  Although healthier, it isn't very filling and they skip out on the chicken.  Sure there is avocado, but there isn't a Li and it isn't worth it for $15. Just get the mushroom strozzapreti or a pizza for around the same price.

Kitty ..,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,4.0,1/11/2018,"3.5/5 Pretty nice little restaurant. The guacamole appetizer has more corn and beans than avocado but was still nice. I ordered the wild mushroom pizza and my bf ordered the chipotle chicken pizza. Both were delicious. I love mushrooms and they do not skip out on the mushroom. Also the chipotle chicken pizza was covered with chicken at the base and topped with corn, beans, cilantro and chiles. They were both really good. They are personal pizzas, each with 6 slices, and since the crust is somewhat thin (depending on the person you get) youre more than likey to finish it and be full. Waiter was good, as soon as the drinks went down she was there ready to offer a refill. I liked watching the chef prepare the pizza infront of us. Its pretty cool watching him stretch the dough, and because its just one guy making all the pizzas i understand that it takes a little time for your food to arrive. It took about 30 mintues for both to come out. Overall it was good. If possible i would come back and try their other dishes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cerritos

Lora M.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,20,3,1.0,10/3/2017,"Honestly, some of the worst delivery service I've ever experienced. I have tried multiple times to give this location second, third and fourth chances. No luck. If you need food by a certain time, say, for scheduled business meetings, DO NOT order from this location.  First time they messed up, order was 30 mins late. Second time, it was OVER AN HOUR LATE. Their excuse was that they didn't have enough people to deliver that day, so took it upon themselves to decide that it was ok to just bring the food when convenient for them. Today, our order was delayed (not even ready for pick up until the scheduled delivery time) because they couldn't handle a modification that was made at 9am, for an 11:45 delivery....  So my advice to you, CPK would be to not allow customers to select a delivery time. If you can't make it happen, don't offer the service. I will do everything I can to make sure the company I work for does not spend another dollar at your location. We have given you far too much business to not be able to rely on a simple delivery time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cerritos
Phoebe C.,"Buena Park, CA",98,1144,1864,4.0,5/30/2017,"I haven't been here in forever, but these are the things I like about this particular CPK: -Location. Located adjacent to the Cerritos Mall, it's great to fuel (or refuel) before or after shopping.  -Free WIFI. Yes, there is free mall wifi but that can be slow. CPK has their own free WIFI. -Fresh menu items. If you haven't been to CPK in years, they have a lot more healthy menu options now, and some are seasonal. I like their classic California club pizza on wheat dough (basically a BLTA pizza) which is lighter and more guilt free than your standard pizza. My mom and I also ordered the Santa Fe chicken bowl for the first time and were pleasantly surprised. It comes with more than enough food and is very colorful and healthy with a ton of textures!  -Free bread with olive oil. Really tasty, hot, and fresh out of the oven.

She was very helpful and honest. With her recommendations in mind we placed our order.  Spinach Artichoke dip - this is always a good idea at CPK. The spinach artichoke dip was very cheesy and hot and comes with chips for scooping all the goodness.  Italian Chopped Salad - Roasted turkey breast, julienned salami, garbanzo beans, tomatoes, Mozzarella and fresh basil tossed in mustard herb vinaigrette. My wife enjoys salads and she like this one. She really enjoyed the light dressing.  Cedar Plank Salmon - North Atlantic salmon roasted on a cedar plank in our hearth oven with smoked paprika and lime. Served with white corn & spinach succotash and topped with Feta. Very good and fish cooked perfectly. Flaky and well seasoned.

Apparently she didn't sign on or turn on the machine that prints out orders that's why she didn't receive any orders. That was fine to me, I understands stuff like that happens. As I was waiting for like what seemed to be hours never once did she acknowledge me waiting for a long period of time. No ""thank you for waiting"" or ""you're good will be out soon"". However, I did over hear her talking bad about a recent customer. Sounds very professional huh? Finally, after a long wait my order is done. You'd think all of that was bad? Well, when she gave me my order she had the nerve to blame me! She said ""next time say you're from door dash instead of telling me the name because that'll confuse me on the order"". Bro, your machine didn't even print out the order so I would've waited long whether I said I was picking up an order for door dash, Shelly, or even my name. Do not blame me.

Waits are unusually long and I've had to send back cold items on multiple occasions. The place is rather small at the corner end of Cerritos Mall and it is freezing cold every time I've eaten there.  As for the food itself, I love the Sedona tortilla soup. The cream is hearty and corn has a slight crunch but is still soft. I also get the veggie sandwich and half salad. They used to sell a really good salad with pears and walnuts topped with a tasty vinagerette dressing. I should be brought back to the menu.  When I ate meat, I loved the Thai, Jamaican jerk, and bbq chicken pizzas. The sauces were yummy! Last time I ate here, the server highly suggested the tostada pizza so I obliged. It was awful!!! I couldn't finish it, it was so lacking in taste. I also think CPK is very much overpriced for their portion sizes. Appetizers are just about the same amounts as pizzas and other food.

Jimmy K.,"Fullerton, CA",58,115,405,4.0,1/30/2015,"Got 2 different pizzas, a salad, & a drink.  Pros: +4 *California Club Hand Tossed Pizza: The chicken was not dry, it was juicy and well seasoned; the combination of basil & romaine lit my taste buds to another level; the arugula & the avocados went very well with the basil & romaine; the lemon pepper mayo also compliments the applewood smoked bacon.  *Margherita Thin Crust Pizza: The Mozzarella was cooked to perfection; good amount of fresh tomatoes; & fresh Parmesan. *BBQ Chicken Salad: This salad is as fresh as it can get. The BBQ chicken was juicy, and well seasoned. The jicama, basil, cilantro, bits of tortilla strips, tomatoes, scallions, Monterey Jack & herb ranch made this salad look like the main entree.  *Red Velvet Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream: Cool, sweet, moist cake. The combination with Vanilla ice cream increases the flavor of the cake.  Service: Decent adequate service on a busy night. Professional & friendly staff.  Cons: -1 *Peach Iced Tea: Too sweet. Second try, too watery with no flavor.

Stacey S.,"Long Beach, CA",686,491,1742,2.0,4/16/2014,"CPK whyyyy?! I spent the day in the mall shopping with my mom, then decided to dine here with her. Upon telling the three hostesses that we'd like a booth for two, they told us they could only seat us on the patio. I let them know we'd like a booth, and that there are plenty available, and to deny us one is illegal. They tell me the patio is all they can give us, I say if that is so, then I can call the police and they can assure them otherwise. Confused? This CPK is not educated on ADA regulations, California penal codes, and Guide Dogs in general. After mentioning police, and dealing with backtalk from two hostesses, we were finally seated at a half booth. *The one hostess told me the other had never encountered a guide dog, and that she didn't know how to handle it, yet they both stood their ground on the outdoor patio bit for a while. When we were seated, my mom was fuming. *She's had guide dogs for 20+ years and dealt with this for as long as she's had them. You'd think by 2014 this type of harassment and barring would be over, especially with major companies. Our waitress came over and was an absolute sweetheart, and didn't even know the dog was under the table (it's what they're trained to do). She apologized wholeheartedly, and even offered to get Mercedes (my mom's guide) a bowl of water. We ordered our cedar plank salmon, and asked to speak to a manager. When he arrived, he acted like he didn't care. He told me he had educated the hostesses at the time (after the fact), and that the situation was remedied. I told him that as a manager, he should train his employees to recognize legitimate service dogs early, so that he doesn't need to do damage control after his employees have done something that can have some terrible results. He walked off. The salmon was great, as always. My mom is now a fan of it, and looks forward to feeling less ""ick"" after eating at CPK (she usually gets pizza, which is heavier).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cerritos?start=80

I wish they weren't afraid to use more than a teaspoon as our pasta was rather dry.

Paul C.,"Cerritos, CA",42,364,503,3.0,1/6/2015,"Went here for dinner on New Years Eve since it was my mom's birthday and my sis had a gift card here. I thought it was gonna be a packed house since many people go out to eat on NYE but surprisingly it was a bit empty. I guess the mall being closed  made sense. Crystal was our server for the night. She took our orders and brought our drinks out. I got this strawberry and mango cooler drink for $2.99 and it was really good. Too bad there's no free refills. Very citrusy (sp?) and refreshing. My parents got the tortilla soup but I didn't care for it. I remember they used to have a corn chowder and it was really good. It's too bad they no longer make it. We all decided to split an appetizer, salad and  2 pizzas. For the appetizer we got the trio of tortilla spring rolls. 3 different varieties, 3 flavors and 3 dips. Baja, mediterranean and Thai. The Thai one is the best especially the peanut sauce. We got the bbq chicken salad and I thought it could've used more jicama and less tortilla chips. For the pizzas we got the bbq chicken with nueske's bacon and the sicilian thin crust pizza. I loved the bacon on the bbq pizza. I felt it could've used a bit more cilantro though. The sicilian pizza was decent and had a nice kick to it and not too overwhelming. It's nice that this place gives a free sundae since it was my mom's birthday and all so that was a nice bonus. Service was average. It took a while for us to get a box to go and our check too even though it wasn't a full house.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cerritos?start=100
Nassrin B.,"Downey, CA",1,13,1,1.0,5/30/2016,The only reason I'm giving this location 1 star is because our waitress was great. I ordered the full size Cobb salad without chicken. The salad was basically just old lettuce. The non lettuce ingredients where of such portion it didn't even taste like a Cobb salad. For a $17 dollar I expect more than a strip of bacon and a slice of avocado and a bowl full of lettuce that was definitely not prepped today. Never going to this location again.  Key lime pie was super sour not creamy and the graham cracker crust oily. Very bummed about $40 bill of low quality food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cerritos?start=100

We called and were informed that our order was not ready and she would be out in about 5 minutes with our order. After 15 minutes of waiting my husband walked inside to find our food just sitting there. The girl behind the counter came up with all kinds of excuses as to why she was so busy and she forgot about our order. Once we got the order home to our family the food was cold and every pizza we ordered was like eating cardboard.

Both of the soups were creamy and tasty. The manager heard it was our first time here and he came to greet us and offer us a free small meal for our next visit. I thought that was nice of him to do.

We asked if we could sit outside (since it was freezing inside!) and were denied.

Just thinking about it makes me want it right now!! If you haven't tried it then you are missing out!! It is not only my favorite pasta dish at CPK but one of my favorites at any restaurant. I like to change the pasta to penne or fusilli instead of fettuccine :)  If I have room for dessert, the red velvet cake is what I order but I usually have to get a to go box because I get such a big portion of food on top of the yummy bread they give you at the table. Yum:) I usually go to this location in Cerritos and the service is efficient and decent. I have found at the handful of CPKs that I've dined at, is that they are overall well run, provide good service and are consistent with the tastiness of the food. It's not like some other chains which seem kind of run down and not that nice. CPK is always a favorite!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cerritos?start=100

The chicken pasta with the green thick flat noodle had a lot to be left desired. A dash of tapatio did the trick...   Very friendly and enthusiastic host and manager who were very welcoming from the beginning. Our server on the other hand looked very miserable and it reflected in her cold demeanor towards us.

I'm not one to automatically look down on chain restaurants, but I usually have low expectations. They are usually overpriced for mediocre food. But, I had dinner here with my boyfriend and parents last weekend, and it surprised me! First off, we were warmly greeted by the host, and immediately seated outside per our request (it was too cold inside with the A/C blasting, and there was a nice breeze outside). Our server, Crystal, came to us almost immediately and we actually needed more time to decide what to order (yay efficient service!). My parents each got pastas, boyfriend got a pizza, and I got a flatbread appetizer and soup duo. Everything tasted really good, and portions were just right. The menu has a nice variety of choices, so even if you don't feel like pizza, you should be able to find something that calls out to you. I think what stood out to me most was the service -- Crystal was super courteous and attentive (without being overbearing), and the whole experience was very comfortable.

Includes chicken which is cooked tenderly and your basic veggies such as red and green bell peppers. I recommend this to all pasta lovers! I've also heard the jambalaya pasta is really good.

Nicholas D.,"Lakewood, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/10/2017,"I was very disappointed tonight, I had higher expectations for the CPK chain. I don't ever write reviews but I felt I had to just to warn people of possible cross contamination at this location. While eating there tonight I watched a manager pick pieces of food off the line to munch on whilst handling food, I witnessed this with my girlfriend while sitting at the bar near the cashier. I also watched 5-6 employees walk around eating ice cream cones in the food preparation area and on the main dining floor. Nobody washed their hands after eating, everyone continued on with normal business. A mother and her young daughter who was around middle school age were sitting at the bar top, which I am pretty sure it is illegal to serve a minor at a bar top. Overall the experience was eye opening and disappointing. The only person in the establishment who seemed to be professional was the girl at takeout named Sonja, our server failed to bring us lemons after asking him three times thankfully the takeout girl was able to help us out with that.

It was not on the menu, but our waiter JORGE ensured me they could do it. Once I got my sandwich it was the WRONG one. When I told our waiter that this actually wasn't what I wanted he did NOT apologize?! His response was that it was ""the same"". Sorry - a piece of chicken, pickles, and tomatoes, is not the same as a chicken Caesar salad. Apparently our waiter didn't care. He charged us for food I did not even eat, and didn't offer a discount, nor did he ask if I wanted something else instead? Needless to say, I won't be going back. He didn't even have time to bring us our check, another gal did. It was a pretty slow Wednesday night so I'm not sure why? Incredibly disappointed with my service.

Joyce A.,"Cerritos, CA",360,683,420,3.0,12/30/2013,"I have to commend the wait staff and servers for their service on Saturday night. We were a party of about thirty (to begin with) and eventually had more than 30 people. I thought they offered cheerful (although harried) service, and tried to get every person's order correct. That's a Herculean feat. (That's really a 4+ stars grade). Now, since we were such a large group, we were seated outside. That would normally be okay, but it was quite chilly this evening, we really were counting on the patio heaters to be in working order. About half of our group sat under a heater that was out of order. That made their dinner quite uncomfortable. There was no possibility  of moving the large group inside. (at least I do not believe it was offered at any time).  (Downgrade to 2 stars) I also got the Wine Flight ( a choice of three whites) : I really need my server to tell me what is being served, and she did not know which was which. Except to say: ""it's what's on the menu!"" Hello? If I knew that , then I would have kept the menu!  I think it  is  part of the server's or waiter's job to know what they are serving Plus be able to answer customer's questions a little more. I know it's a chain restaurant but that would distinguish restaurant service from a drive-through! (2 stars) Food wise: got the white pizza - best of course consumed right out of their hot oven. (Five cheeses, spinach  and optional bacon). Quite delicious! Pasta choice: Asparagus & Spinach spaghettini with added shrimp - really good! Lightly dressed with olive oil & garlic, Not greasy or heavy which just fit the bill for after Christmas Day dinner. Both choices were split between myself & my mom, plus brought home the rest - enough for another lunch! (3 Stars) Recommend: fix the patio heater please!

While food has always tasted amazing despite the area, this review is for the deplorable customer service particular for this location. My family and I came here on a Saturday night and working in a restaurant myself, my tolerance usually gives leeway to rookie mistakes. But man was it stretched by the service here. I ordered a salad and an appetizer while my family ordered regular entrees as our meals. Everything but the appetizer made it out within 15 minutes, which was great, but by the time we were finishing up the last bites of our main dishes, the appetizer had yet to arrive. Our waiter Jorge never came by to check up on us or to refill our drinks; I had to get up and physically find him to ask him where my appetizer was. He assured me only a couple of minutes. A runner comes by with a plate of quesadillas. Not our order. Another runner comes by with a huge pepperoni pizza. Nope, not my order again. Jorge came by to apologize about the wrong order, again repeating a couple of minutes. I'm confused why something listed as an appetizer would take this long to make. He brings the check as the appetizer finally comes out, like it was his last performance and he seems proud of himself. I would've been too... if he had brought us the right check. Our party of 4 was stuck with a $20 check for a good while before we flagged him down to tell him that it wasn't the right check. He looks at us confused and said, ""What did you guys order again?"" Are you kidding me? Look it up in your computer and check the table number and realize the check that says 1 guest obviously isn't us. I was tempted to tip nothing for a waiter who didn't give a fig about us but my mother, the gracious woman, told me not to do and he received a 15% tip despite being an awful waiter.

We approached the hostess and she said she called our names and crossed us off, which never occurred we were right outside the entrance. Hostess says no problem we will seat you right away. 10 min pass and we still see her continue to seat people. After waiting a total of 40 min we are fed up and file a complaint to the management then leave.

First of all you should know this was my second time coming to have dinner here (Cerritos) and although it might seem like I'm jumping into the gun in giving this location a bad review I often visit CPK in Lakewood (Mall) at least 3 to 4 times every two weeks. This review is in comparison to the Lakewood location, I always order the same thing which is the Ribeye Steak ""it is sooooo good...from the Lakewood CPK"". Ok so from the point the waiter took our order it took way to long to receive the food I would say roughly 30 minutes twice as long as it would have taken in the Lakewood location. Even getting the drinks took to long!! The steak was dry no flavor at all the only good thing about that night was the arugula, that was good.

Wesley C.,"Monterey Park, CA",219,197,41,4.0,4/7/2014,"The last time i went to CPK was a long time ago and they've since changed things up!!  Wine glasses at the table, and a little more extravagant. Their starter breads are different! More ""artisan"" type, instead of the sliced white bread. And no more butter with the bread- olive oil.  FOOD: Our group ordered the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer. Decent. Nothing really special about it. 3/5. I had ordered the spicy chipotle chicken pizza on wheat (tricking myself into thinking its healthier because its made of wheat hehe). My girlfriend had the california cobb pizza, also on wheat. The spicy chipotle chicken pizza had a nice kick of spice and an array of flavors- basically a salsa on top of a pizza. 4/5 The cobb pizza is decent. The bitterness of the arugula works well with the salty bacon, though i had a hard time finding the bacon. 3/5 The prices are a little on the high side. $15 for each pizza. For that price, you can get a whole large pizza from Costco, though one can argue that CPK's pizza's are ""gourmet"". Overall 3/5 SERVICE: Our waitress was nice and frequently checked up on us. Water was always filled without even requesting. Food was served pretty fast, especially the appetizer. Overall 4/5 DECOR/AMBIANCE: Despite the fact that we were seated next to a family with a baby who couldn't stop banging the silverware against the ceramic plate, the place is very chill atmosphere. It can fill the role of a casual date restaurant to a family dinner. A lot of 2-seat tables and enough tables for large groups. Decor is clean and simple.  Overall 4/5 A lot of people may not like CPK because it's so commercialized and franchised, but you know what, it's not bad. Yes, the pizzas are a bit pricey, but they offer a variety of unique flavors that are hardly seen anywhere else.

A lady named Kaysi kindly took our order, and made sure to offer us some waters while we waited. They had no problem with us sitting at the bar while we waited. When our food was ready, another kind lady named Anna bagged our order and offered us complimentary bread along with the Parmesan cheese, and peppers.  When we got home (30 miles later since we only came to Cerritos for the Apple store), we noticed our avocado egg rolls were missing. I was pretty upset but figured I could at least call to get the amount of the egg rolls refunded to my gift card. When I spoke to Kaysi, she apologized and transferred me over to her manager, Tim, for the refunding the amount. He too was very kind and apologetic. He mentioned the system wouldn't allow him to refund the egg rolls to my gift card, so he said the best thing to do was to refund my gift card the whole amount of my order ($35!) for the inconvenience, especially since we were too far to come back to pick up our missing egg rolls.

For dessert I like the red velvet cake, yum! The chocolate soufflé cake is pretty good too when I'm craving chocolate.  The prices aren't too bad, it's worth it. Attire is casual, not fancy, Usually I would get iced tea but I tried the sangria because they have more wine options and it was soooooo good. It wasn't to strong and the fruit didn't overwhelm the  glass, and the glass was big.  Overall, I love this place I go to this location or lakewood. There both the same for me.

I tried the new shrimp scampi zucchini pasta (item under 650 cal) and it was so good. It had great garlic flavor and the shrimp was nice and big.

Soda is $2.75.  I think this place would be great if prices were lower, but I find it kinda expensive.  The best deal on the menu is the kid's meal.  For about $5.50, you get an entree and drink.  For two pasta dishes, one kid's meal, two fish taco dishes, and two sodas, the bill came to over $68.  That seems like a lot to me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cerritos?start=200

I continued to order my favorite pizza to go until they discontinued it (roasted pepper with goat cheese and bacon).  Needed a quick non-fast food lunch for 4 at work today so I offer to fly and pick up curbside. My grilled veggie salad was a full plastic container of lettuce (still very wet and watery) and some avocado.  That's it.  Clearly the other plastic container of actual grilled veg was forgotten somewhere, so I paid $13.50 for fifty cents worth of wet lettuce.  The bread bags with oil and vinegar all had open containers of oil, so those all went into the trash immediately. Utensils for three people, party of four.  I understand mistakes happen, but it's not like I could have my waitress bring my missing food or a fresh fork.  It's TAKE OUT. It should be triple checked before it exits the building. Don't offer curbside if you aren't going to invest in training the staff to service it. 10 strikes, you're out, CPK.

I get there about 8:40 and call them to let them know I'm waiting at the curbside parking. The hostess answers and transfers me to take out. The damn phone rings for about 3 mins before I hang up. I can't imagine how CPK could allow their phone in the take out area to ring for 3 mins! I know the phone could be put on silent but that's unacceptable, especially they know people place take out orders. So I hang up after about 3 mins of ringing. I call back and get transferred again and this time it rings for about 2 mins before someone answers. So 5 mins of listening to the damn phone ring and I finally get someone to answer. At this point I'm really irritated. I could've walked into the place and just picked up my food (which I should have just done in the first place) Anyway the guy answers and says he'll be out right away...10 mins later I call back into the restaurant to see where my food is and as I'm on hold again with take out the guy shows up to my car with my LUKE WARM food. When I order curbside I usually tip, however this was one time I chose not to. 2 Stars for you today CPK.

I can say that for a franchise, it's pretty decent, especially for a franchised sit down restaurant. Pseudo high end but clearly casual, CPK proves to be the Middle Land between the dwarfs of Olive Garden and the evil Mountain Troll of giant conglomerate kingdoms such as Finbars and Il Fornaio. If Wolfgang Puck could create a better and tastier line of pizzas, CPK would be it. Granted Wolfy isn't really someone on my To Eat list, but CPK takes the belt over him any day. All in all, the pastas are decent. I particularly like the Penne and Sausage. When it comes to the pizzas, I've only had two. Margarita with garlic and Goat Cheese added on. Pretty good. Could use more garlic. The Works. Fairly good. Could use more garlic and vegetables. I'd say that the best thing I've had thus far would be the soups. The original Potato Leek soup has been taken off the menu, which is a real shame because it was one of the best soups I've ever had. On a more recent occasion, I've sampled the chicken corn chowder which was surprisingly tasty. I'd go back just for that. Cheese focaccia bread appetizer was fair. Nothing great, nothing bad.

The nice girl called us back in not long after we put our name on the wait list and we were stationed at the back right table. My girl and I ordered the Spinach Artichoke Dip appetizer which tasted good. The dip wasn't too salty nor bland and it came with black and white colored tortilla chips. Nice little filler before our entree. My 2 fish taco was great. I added a dollar more for avocado on it, but it could do without next time because the taco was already good as is. They added shredded cabbage in the taco with some really good dressing on it. It's probably simple to make I'm sure with mayonnaise being the main ingredient I assume. The fish look like it was breaded a bit and grilled to a brown and served on a flour tortilla. My dish came with more of those tortilla chips and salsa. If you haven't tried it yet make way for it next time. My Hun ordered the Barbecue Chicken Pizza. It was small sized and had I think six slices. Though small, it still was big enough to feed two people with little a little stomach like myself and my babe. Not bad I say. It was sprinkled with onions and cilantro or chives I think. The pizza definitely stuffed us and we started having regrets ordering the appetizer, but not because it wasn't good, but it was too much food for us at the end. The total came out around $38 (no drinks, just water), but we didn't even flinch because my girlfriend's friend hooked us up with a gift card so all we paid for was the difference. Our waitress was really kind and came over to us frequently to make sure we did fine so we tipped her generously for her service.

When we got to our booth, we waited some more and we placed our order with our server.  She was pretty nice.  The crappy part was that she didn't offer us any bread and it took her forever to get our drinks and our food out.   They're doing a promo right now where you get like a scratch card and everyone wins, but we were not offered to participate in that promo.  I thought that was pretty rude.  The people next to us and across from our booth was offered the little promo and a few other people from work had talked about it so we were excited to do it.  I would've asked about it, but we got our food late and by the time we got our bill, I was just interested in paying for our meal and getting out of there.

The honey accents the pizza perfectly and even though I'm not 10 anymore... I order this(x2). no shame.  Korean BBQ Steak Tacos- Small Cravings Menu- Whenever I order this, the servings of Ksteak are small. I personally think it's too spicy but the flavors are very good other than that.  Spinach Artichoke Dip- It's perfect. Just order it.  Sesame Chicken Dumplings- The sauce is tangy and sweet at the same time, while the chicken is cooked perfectly. The ""wonton skin"" is chewy and has a good texture. They also give extra sauce just in case you want more.  Chinese Chicken Salad- Crispy, refreshing, filling, and delicious. It's really addicting. Once you order it, you want to get it every time you eat at CPK. It doesn't even feel like you're eating a salad... that's how good it is.  Wild Mushroom Pizza- If you like mushrooms, obviously this pizza is for you. Last time we ordered this, they forgot to add the chicken and when we brought it up to the server to take it back to the kitchen and use the chicken that we were going to pay for... they just took it back and dropped the chicken pieces on. Disappointing, but it still tasted great.  Four Cheese Ravioli- I love ravioli, but for the price at CPK... I don't think it's worth it. I could make the same entree at home for like $5 less.  Desserts- Butter Cake = 10/10 Hot Fudge Sundae 8/10 The cs is very good as CPK is normally crowded. The restrooms are always clean and the atmosphere is very comfortable.

They are either unable or unwilling to take action to remedy the situation.  Last night I had to park approx. 1/4 mile from the restaurant to collect my takeout order. I cannot imagine even the most indifferent of restaurant management would consider that acceptable.  (2) Though the restaurant was not particularly busy yesterday (it was late afternoon on New Year's Eve, after all), it required nearly an hour from the time I placed the order until I walked out of the restaurant with my order.  Again, I cannot bring myself to imagine this would be deemed acceptable.  (3) Finally, my spouse ordered the ribeye steak, prepared medium well.  What was provided turned out to be EXCEPTIONALLY well done (and not in the good way ... think shoe leather).

I felt like going into PF Chang and expecting Chinese food and all I got was a fancy show decoration, but not a real Chinese food. This was like that, but replace the Chinese food with pizza.  I ordered a Thai Chicken pizza which they considered to be one of the original pizza of theirs. Think of it this way, it's a small thin crusted pizza with breast of chicken marinated in a special sauce, then sprinkled some cheese, onion, carrots, cilantro, and some peanuts. Viola! That was my pizza. Heck, the frozen pizza I got from the supermarket was bigger than this.....and this Thai Chicken pizza cost $10.69.  Yes...the word is pizza FUSION. In other words...fake pizza.  I also ordered Tortilla Spring Rolls in Baja Chicken Style. That was actually better than the pizza itself. Anytime an appetizer taste better than the pizza, you will be in whole lot of disappointment.  Why am I giving this place a four stars? Well, the service here was outstanding. Friendly staff that are quick on their toes. No disappearing act or attitudes coming from any of them. Nice chic kind of atmosphere even for a pizza place. I noticed that a lot of people ordered salads or pasta, which gave me new ideas what to order if I come back next time.   They also served beverages like Chiroc vodka and have a kick a*s dessert like taramisu. Their wine list is very extensive for something of a pizza place. Margaritas are served here too. So you can guess it's not a greasy cheesy pizza place.   CPK also do catering and take out. They set aside a take out register next to the counter seats on far side. You can also get tables on the patio if the weather is nice. Overall, it was one of the nicer place in a dingy like Cerritos Mall.  Now if only they can do something about the puny little pizza, I would have gladly given them 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cerritos?start=260

I came here with my friends and we ordered Tuscan Hummus as an appetizer, Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza, and Butter Cake as a dessert. I'm usually not a fan of hummus, but Tuscan Hummus was pretty good. Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza was delicious as I expected. The crust was thin--just the way I like it--and there was a decent amount of toppings on the crust.  Even though the appetizer and pizza were pretty awesome, the highlight of the day was Butter Cake. The perfect combination of the cake and ice cream was heavenly. The cake was very interesting because the outside of the bread was a bit crispy while the inside was very VERY soft.  I will definitely come back, and next time I go, I'm going to try a different dessert! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cerritos?start=240

Charles C.,"Arleta, CA",613,3,2,1.0,3/5/2011,"Always was a good place to eat until yesterday. Now we'll never eat there again. We used to just pick up food to go and eat it at the house, but now that's not even an option. If it's possible to give no stars, then I would. It was a Friday night and i understand it gets busy, but it felt like the only one that knew how to speak to customers was the manager. First of all, we've eaten there a bunch of times before, so when I call back and say you messed up our food, then don't treat us like we don't know what we ordered.  Second of all, all we ordered was the split pea and barley soup and a Thai crunch salad......HOW HARD IS IT TO F#*% UP A SOUP AND A SALAD? apparently not that hard after all. Third, if i call and ask why ALL THE OTHER TIMES I've had my salad, there was edamame in it and I tell you that this one doesn't. Don't respond with ""oh, they must have forgotten it, sometimes they do that."" NO NO NO, if a salad is supposed to have edamame in it, isn't it ALWAYS supposed to have edamame in it??? not just sometimes! Just own up to it and say, I'm sorry and offer to exchange it for one that's properly made. It's a freaking salad after all, it doesn't take that long to make. Instead, you don't want to admit, that when it supposedly was done from the kitchen, you didn't double check to make sure it looked correct! and the dressing looked like one of the ingredients was missing from it, instead of it looking green and healthy, it looked like oil and herbs were thrown together and put in a to-go container. Next, if we ordered a split pea and barley soup, then i call back telling you it doesn't look right, don't ask what color it is and continue to tell me that THAT is what we ordered. because all the other 20 times we've ordered it, it didn't look anything like that. it looked unappetizing, watered down and looked like they gave us what was at the bottom of the pot. All I wanted was a healthy meal and some freaking competent servers. Instead, what I got was: -Being told it'll be done at 8:25pm, showing up to pick it up and it wasn't ready, finally got it at 8:41pm.  -Then calling and getting a server that was trying to convince us that we were wrong instead of apologizing and offering to replace the food. -And a big headache from dealing with idiots. I ended up giving the food back cause they refunded my money over the phone, but I didn't feel like eating a free, disgusting looking, half prepared meal. the girl at the counter said ""oh, you didn't have to bring it back."" and I said ""it's fine, my girlfriend didn't want to eat it or throw it away so I'm giving it back...."" and she looked at me and said "" We already deleted it, you didn't have to bring the food back."" (like getting my money back was the only reason I came back) I already knew I was getting my money back, I just wanted to show you how fed up I was by actually returning the food and not being a little ungrateful little prick and eating something that I got for free, after complaining. and still no apology, she just shrugged her shoulders and continued to grab the bag and put it net to their trashcan. I WILL NOT BE EATING THERE AGAIN, NOR WILL I EVER ORDER ANYTHING TO GO. it's always been good service, but it shows that when they get a little busy on a Friday night, they forget to treat their customers with respect and don't do their job correctly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cerritos?start=240

That being said I strongly believe CPK has some of the most original and flavorful pizza I've ever had... yes, I've had pizza from NY, DC and Chicago and so far CPK has been my favorite. The main thing to take away from CPK is that there's always something that will suite your mood...  You want sweet, they got it You want savory, check You want a little bit of both, double check The list goes on and on, light, heavy, veggie, carnivorous, etc, etc etc Probably one of the most diverse menus I've ever seen.   CPK is a slam dunk when it comes to finding something for every one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cerritos?start=240
John D.,"Long Beach, CA",3,10,,2.0,12/26/2010,"I typically don't like eating at chain restaurants, and this experience reminded me why. This location is in the Cerritos mall, so there were a lot of people dining in after returning/exchanging Christmas gifts. Our server, Sandy, was as nice as can be and tried her best to accommodate us even though there was a high volume of traffic. Kudos for the effort. Here's where the experience fell short. I ordered a glass of wine. Glass came back with a piece of green onion floating around. Asked for a fresh glass. Observed a guy behind the bar pour my wine from my dirty glass into a new glass. Told our server what I just saw, said I probably wouldn't have cared had I not seen it, but I saw so I want another glass. Third glass comes out and it has red wine residue or lipstick marks on the lip of the glass. By this time, I figured that's as good as it's gonna get so I suck it up and don't complain. My chicken picatta comes out and the first thing I notice is an eyelash on the plate. Again, I said screw it and pulled the eyelash out and continued on. I guess it was okay because it only was touching the outside edge of my food, so I avoided it. My chicken picatta was good, though. I don't mind a little honest dirt in my dining experience if it is par for the course. I've eaten in outdoor markets in third world countries and am able to chock it up to being part of the experience. But this isn't a third world country and there are food handling standards inspected and graded by the health department. I'm not expecting a coat and tie affair with linen tablecloths.

We ordered the Mediterranean veggie wrap appetizers and they were good, but they were served with this sweet marinara sauce that was awful! For dinner I ordered the Crunchy Thai Salad - I get avocado in lieu of chicken and it's truly delicious. For dessert we ordered the red velvet cake to share and it was good.

Lauren K.,"La Palma, CA",1,9,,3.0,4/3/2013,"I've a huge fan of CPK for years. But slowly their changes to the menu items have been quite annoying. Few years back, one of my fav dishes, Thai Chicken Pasta, was completely taken off the menu. They also added some new dishes then, too. (I think the Cajan Jambalaya, I think...)  Fine. I get it--changing times, changing tastes buds...   Then today, I took my mom and my 2 kids to CPK for lunch. We ordered the Original BBQ Pizza, Waldorf Salad, Spicy Kung Pao Spaghetti and Spaghetti Bolognese. Pizza and the Bolognese was ok...the usual. But what happened to the Kung Pao Spaghetti and Waldorf Salad???  the spaghetti didnt have the same spicy taste; the shrimp was battered very thick n deep fried (which ended up being mushy by the middle of the meal); and the Waldorf was a wilted n brown--some parts of the spring lettuce; there was waaaaay to much crumbled cheese which over powered the simple dressing and the grapes were sadly mushy and not crisp. Another change:  the regular bread and butter has been replaced by a crispy baguette type bread with a side of olive oil which had pieces of parsely(?), garlic(?) and pepper flakes. The taste of the oil was very different. I'm still trying to figure out the ingredients are.  Overall, the service is good. The restaurant is clean considering the foot traffic from the mall shoppers.

Drink:  Arnold Palmer (I'm a Cokester and with a Pepsi-serving restaurant it's always a Palmer for me Appetizer:  SIngapore Shrimp Rolls (even though they don't taste anything like real Singaporean), Tortilla Spring Rolls in either Thai or Mediterranean (I try to get all three options but have only succeeded at the SF one my friends work at) Salad:  Chinese Chicken Salad (TO DIE FOR) Pizza:  Original BBQ Chicken on honey wheat with extra cilantro That being said, this location did everything right.  While we skipped appetizers and salads for the main pizza event, everything was perfect from the wait time to the service Winfield gave us (yeah that was his real name!). Of course the San Franciscan-franchise-hating part of me hates CPK.  But the CA native in me just loves it so!   Pizza box art?  How could you go wrong?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cerritos?start=300

I really wanted to try one of their newer sandwiches (I forgot which one) but instead they served me a turkey sandwich. I didn't want to have to complain and give it back since I could tell they were busy so I ate it anyway.

(keep reading. haha) Why? You'll find that CPK has unique pizzas both in flavor and price. Same goes for their pasta... except that they're not unique in flavor. PRICE PRICE PRICE is where it's at, and it's definitely not here. almost 30 bucks for 2 plates of pasta? c'mon now. I better get gold flakes in them things, too! Service seemed nice if time wasn't an issue.  In the end, I'm a pretty forgiving guy. If i run across this place again, we'll let the update speak for itself.  But for now, my position stands.

CS W.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,18,,1.0,7/28/2012,"Went to this CPK right before Christmas last year with my husband and our young son. The food was just eh and the service was awful (not to mention having to wait nearly 30 minutes for a table). Ohhhhh but just wait, it gets worse..... We leave and I realize that I accidentally left my son's pictures with Santa Clause on the table (my fault, I admit it). Run back inside and they check in their little server stand and tell me its not there. The hostess asks the bus boy and he claims not to have seen anything. No apology, no anything at all. They acted as though it was completely my fault. Umm......okay...... I walk outside and I'm crying because I'm so upset and my husband goes back in and demands to speak to the manager. He calmly explains the situation and the manager just sorta shrugs and tells him that they looked but he (my husband) can go check the dumpster if he'd like. (SERIOUSLY?!?!?!?!)  I will NEVER dine at CPK (any of them) again. Worse than terrible experience. Those pictures (which weren't cheap) are memories that I can NEVER get back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cerritos?start=320
Gina G.,"Paramount, CA",0,7,,1.0,4/22/2011,"Ok, CPK has excellent food no doubt about that. It may be slightly over-priced, but it's always consistently good.  One of my favorite things used to be asking for the complimentary french bread to be toasted. There was something always comforting and warm to have the bread toasted in their pizza ovens delivered hot with yummy butter while waiting for my pasta and salad.  Well, I recently discovered that they WILL NOT do that anymore based on company policy! WTF? OMG! I asked, begged, and pleaded. They were rudely adament.  I even asked the manager if they would toast our bread before giving our name to be seated. When she said no, I told her we were probably going to eat elsewhere then and she said, ""ok,"" as if they were willing to lose customers instead of abiding a small, simple request.  I even asked if I could pay extra and she said, ""No, they can't do it."" Finally, after lying that Lakewood still does it for us, she rolled her eyes and said they would do it this one time, but for us to never ask for it again!  By the time it came, it was barely warm and not nearly toasted!  My suggestion, if you go to CPK, ask for your bread toasted, so maybe they'll bring it back for the few of us who enjoy it this way!

rachelle c.,"Cypress, CA",198,28,19,1.0,11/1/2008,"so they say pizza is like sex... being that you can never be served up something bad. but this cpk in particular is the exception to this rule. the pizza here is average. more or less bland, nothing extraordinary.  yesterday i showed up and ordered the wild mushroom pizza.  it was nothing special and in dire need of seasoning.  right away as soon as the pizza hit the table i asked for crushed pepper and hot sauce. 3 slices later (hey just cuz it wasnt great dont mean i wont eat it!)  my table was still red pepper free and tabasco-less.  my server passed up my empty cup several times as he waited on the other 3 tables surrounding me.  TITO was his name....ignoring me was his game. but what really REALLY pissed me off is when he passed right by me and placed a brand new bottle of hot sauce and a shaker of parmesean and pepper at the table directly across from me and on his way back asked  me how everything was going...... ""CHECK PLEASE! im fed up with your incompetence food runner. make haste so i can leave this horrible establishement."" i replied...not really but it went a little something like that. so like i wrote on your reciept wrapped around the 14.06 (EXACT AMOUNT OWED)  THANKS FOR NOTHING TITO!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cerritos?start=320
Tangee W.,"Cerritos, CA",20,40,3,2.0,8/31/2013,"I love CPK, i really do, but cerritos CPK, eh.  Normally when i get food at this CPK i get curbside or takeout but their takeout/curbside service is not good or consistent.  I have gone home several times with food that was incomplete, like for example, i ordered a caramelized peach salad with grilled chicken, and i get home their was no peaches, dressing, and no chicken!  When i called CPK and spoke to a manager they told me that i could drive back and pick up those items if i wanted to, WHAT?!?  No,  I will not leave my home to go all the way back to pick that up, i mean i ordered a peach salad and i get no peaches!  This hasn't only happened once but several times with different dishes.  Also, the food doesn't taste the same in comparison to other CPK's that I go to and not  in a good way either.  When i walk in to pick up takeout I always see staff on the side talking, I don't get greeted by the staff, most times it takes  about 15min for someone to even notice that I'm standing in front of the takeout counter, and when they finally do see me they talk to other staff about personal stuff while helping me.  I've had this experience every time I order food here with different workers.  This CPK needs new management because apparently there is no one training and watching over their staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cerritos?start=320

Pia S.,"Buena Park, CA",1,10,5,4.0,7/17/2009,"Okay, so I went to CPK yesterday. I vowed to write a review for every place I go to. And so I'm not breaking it anytime soon.  My mom and I walk in to get seated. It was around noon and there was an okay amount of people. We were seated really quickly and our server was nice.  Decor: It seemed pretty modern-American kind of themed. With lots of tables and chairs inside and out, it was pretty cool. The colors are yellow and white and brown kind of, same as their famous logo. The kitchen was visible from the seating. That was a good thing because you can see if the cook drops all the spaghetti on the floor and gives it to the customers anyway. So you can be sure of having a great meal that didn't require the 5-second rule. There is faint music in the background and I wish I could have heard it better. But when ""Love Story"" by Taylor Swift came on, the whole restaurant became sort of quiet. I didn't care! I love that song!  Food: I ordered the Traditional Cheese Pizza. I'm a traditional gal, and I don't really like so many toppings. And it seemed kind of slow to get my order, but I'm not a chef, so I don't know how long it takes to bake pizza, so I'll just let it slide. I like how all their pizzas are so thin. It's nice. I also ordered water, and it tasted somewhat... I don't know... weird. It was clean, but it just didn't taste right. And on my bendy straw, there was a slit in the bendy part! It always happens to me, and I don't know why! And for dessert, Red Velvet Cake! My favorite dessert in the world!!!!! So I ordered it comparing it to all the other restaurants who serve this dish. It high up there, but I have to say that Claim Jumper's Red Velvet Cupcakes are my favorite. It was nice a moist and the icing or whatever was sweet. Usually when I taste red velvet cakes from other places, it seems kind of sour.  Service: Our waitress was very nice and cool. She was kind of slow at the process of the check. And that's the part where people want to leave. So we waited a while until she gave us our change and whatnot and left.  I will definitely be coming back here again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-cerritos?start=320

In all seriousness tho, I've been to CPK twice now (both times at the Cerritos location) and I just wasn't really blown alway by anything. The pizza recipies just weren't that great.

Moose C.,"Cerritos, CA",13,130,9,4.0,5/12/2007,"Am I the ony one that tends to blurt 'California Pizza Chicken'? For some reason, I always to that.  I always get the Chicken Tequila Fettucine with a Strawberry Club Soda. It's delicious and free refills!! However, once I had an 'upset stomach' from eating the fettucine. Wasn't very fun.  I also remember getting a Tortilla Soup (I think?) and it had a hair in it. I told the waitress, and she took it back and gave me a new one. She came back awfully quick. It makes me wonder if she just took the hair out, wiped the plate clean, and gave it back to me... Their pizza is mediocre. Personally, I would love some plain old Pizza Hut  than the 'fancy' pizza that they offer. Other than that, it's great! The waiters are amiable, and are willing to help you pick out something to eat if you're unsure.  For me, I always get the two things, the fettucine and the drink. That's it. I've realized that if I order desert, it's just way too much for me to eat! I always look so eager to eating there, but after the meal, I always kinda regret it. Too much food and money...
