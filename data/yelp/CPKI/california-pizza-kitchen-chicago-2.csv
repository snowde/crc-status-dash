Montgomery M.,"Chicago, IL",92,6,1,4.0,7/11/2017,Me and my friends stopped by the first time cause we had a coupon and we had a great time! They seemed a little busy but our server Ross was super polite and attentive (also super cute. Let me know if Ross needs a girlfriend.) We got the mushroom pasta and the garlic chicken pizza and both were delicious. The restaurant itself was cozy and chic too. Can't wait to go back. Ps- the manager seemed to scowl a lot and it was kinda scary,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-2
Alex A.,"Chicago, IL",71,44,42,4.0,3/4/2017,"I always pass this place and always say to myself  that I should give it try; needless to say, I finally did!   I went here with my girlfriend on a Friday afternoon and quickly got seated.  The staff is very friendly (but not like, awkward friendly, like a cool friendly).  The feel of the place is also very relaxing and conversational.   We got the buffalo chicken pizza.  The pizza was good, nothing super amazing but definitely better than some of the usual pizza spots.  My *only* comment would be that there was not enough chicken on the pizza.  I know i know, these type of comments are usually a little unmeasured or vague (or maybe just me being a fatass), but I took the time to try and count the bites i had per slice that included chicken.  Even though the pizza has ""chicken"" in its name, it had a lot more of the rest of the ingredients (beans, green peppers, jalapeños, etc).  Some slices even had just *ONE* little shred of chicken...which was a little disappointing.   Regardless, if it wasn't for that, the pizza was very good and would come here again.  Definitely worth a try for those of you considering to check it out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-2
Chelsia L.,"Chicago, IL",637,128,141,5.0,10/2/2017,"I love CPK so much and always have! I wish there were more locations but this one is pretty easy to get to. Looking at the reviews, there is definitely a mixed bag but the service here has always been amazing for me. Last time I came here my server was super friendly and engaging not only in helping us order/bringing us food but also in conversation. He talked enough that we made a connection but not enough that it disturbed me and my guest. The food here is nothing special but is in no means bad. My favorite pesto pasta is actually from CPK - if you haven't had it yet, you must try it! The sun-dried tomatoes add such a nice tang to the creamy pesto plus you can add chicken to make it a full meal. I also really enjoy their flatbreads and of course their pizza. It's a family friendly restaurant and they offer delivery through DoorDash as well. Will always be coming back to CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-2

Huds B.,"Chicago, IL",0,14,4,2.0,5/17/2017,"Just O.K.  The gnats (insects) and the server's lethargic energy made this experience rather lack luster. The food taste 'alright' and the special cucumber soda was pretty good. The venue is tourist-ee and overpriced for the type and quality of food provided. My colleague and I had to move seats, without the help of the server, because the gnats wanted to enjoy our cucumber soda, too. I would not recommend California Pizza Kitchen place for locals or for those looking for a quick, inexpensive and tasty bite.

I've always been a fan of Lou Malnati's and Giordano's. So when this place opened I didn't think it would last, but I was wrong. So I figured I would try it out for once.  I went during lunch time. I was greeted by Lorenzo right away and was shown to my table. Lorenzo is such a great guy!! I can't even begin to explain how awesome he is. Jordan was my server and she is amazing as well. She was so friendly and tour guided the menu for me. I decided on doing a lunch special. BBQ chicken pizza, potato soup and iced tea. She then brought out olive oil and bread for me while I waited on my meal. When the food arrived it looked delicious and it was. I wasn't a fan of the cilantro on the pizza so I picked it off. The soup was great.  After stuffing my face I had a sweet tooth and Jordan recommended a few desserts. I ended up getting the salted caramel pudding. Omg!! It hit the spot. I will be back.

Bob R.,"Palatine, IL",223,623,715,5.0,3/30/2015,"We were here a few weeks ago as a family. It was a Saturday evening and it was not crowded. The weather was pretty cold, so it was not surprising people stayed in. Located in the heart of River North, California Pizza Kitchen is very convenient. As a person with a milk allergy, you might wonder why I would go to a pizzeria. Frankly, and so there is full disclosure, my daughter recently got a job here. But, my review is not based on her being there, but on the experience and the food. They have many options for people who can't or don't do milk products. First of all, they have a nice drink menu. I shared a cocktail with my daughter - don't recall exactly what it was called, but it was berry flavored, fizzy and tasty. I also had their version of split pea soup. I believe this was vegan and it was great. The only downside was the portion was so large, I had trouble eating my whole meal after that. We also got an order of their egg roll sampler. They had three different varieties. While I didn't have any of them, I was told they were excellent. For my meal, yes, I ordered a pizza without cheese. I've done this before in various restaurants and have always been disappointed. I had one of their hand tossed pizzas. Figuring it had to have a lot to account for the lack of cheese, I ordered their version of the works. First of all, the crust was outstanding. Although I live in Chicago, I grew up outside of New York and miss the style of crust from the East. This was very similar - doughy on the inside and crisp on the outside. The toppings were plentiful and fresh. If I had not had a bowl of soup before it came, I'm certain I would have finished it. But, I was only able to eat 1/2 of it and took the rest home. I do go to River North quite a lot although I find the restaurants there tend to be tourist traps. Having been to other California Pizza Kitchens over the years, I would classify this as consistent with the others and not too touristy. But, all in all, I was very happy with the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-2?start=20
Sabrina C.,"Chicago, IL",512,186,274,5.0,12/6/2014,"This place continues to climb up my list of favorites! Sometimes deciding where to grab something delicious without having to wait an hour or so, in Chicago on a Friday night, can be an overwhelming task. CPK took care of that for me last night!  Appetizer - I went for the fried mac n'cheese. I wanted something tasty without it being too heavy on the stomach. They were perfectly fried in panko bread crumbs and very reasonably priced. Drinks - My friend and I tried quite a few of them! The Appleberry Sangria was great. The Platinum Margarita, which is a new menu item of theirs, was even better and you can choose an additional floater on top of it, either Grand Marnier or Chambord; we had a number of those. Try it!!!!! Dinner - Can we say filling?!?! I had the Pesto Cream Penne with chicken and shrimp. I wish I could put pesto on everything. I could only get through half of my dish, which was the same story for my friend who had the Garlic Cream Fettuccine with chicken and shrimp. Mine was definitely better though! Dessert - Oh desert lords..... you are amazing. GET THE BUTTER CAKE A LA MODE! It must have the dust of angels baked into it. It must have happiness sprinkled on the top. The cake batter must have pieces of clouds as its base. It was BEYOND delicious and no matter how much I tried to stop eating it, I couldnt. I was two chews away from my pants bursting at the seams and still couldn't get enough. The manager highly recommended it and she was so right! She asked if I would be back the same time next week for it. Absolutely! *swoon* Overall, this is a great spot to eat some good food at a very reasonable price, coupled with great drinks. The service made it even better. I had a great waiter at the bar who knew what to recommend and the manager was a total sweetheart and absolute doll. Make CPK one of your choices. Oh and the validated parking ($14) for three hours makes it even better. BUTTER CAKE! IM COMING BACK FOR YOU!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-2?start=20

Shari B.,"Chicago, IL",36,266,171,4.0,1/22/2015,"While I feel a bit silly reviewing a chain restaurant where the food you order should be the same across all their other restaurants across the country, I felt that since I've dined her twice and ordered take-out once, it warranted a review. My first two visits came back in November when the lines at nearby Shake Shack were extremely long. Being heavily pregnant then, I was not going to torture myself in the cold so I opted to dine here. Service was good both times and both times I ordered the Kung Pao Spaghetti.  It was a dish I ordered in the past and they still make it as good as I remembered. Earlier this month, I received a gift card for CPK and used it to get take-out. Their take-out process is very simple with a dedicated line (press #1 after dialing their number) and I was able to place my order easily. My only gripe was there was a lot of upselling on the phone- asking me to join some program, asking me if I want breadsticks or desserts, telling me about their new specials, etc. While I understand it's their job to upsell, as a new mother who is lacking in sleep and craving carbs, I just want my order placed ASAP. Rawr (this is my attempt at roaring).  Pick-up at CPK was very easy and, as usual, the staff was very nice. I'm definitely a fan of this place but should limit my visits as $17 for a bowl of spaghetti will quickly leave me broke.

So, we ordered one barbeque chicken pizza and one pizza with pineapple and other fruits. We shared them, and they were both delicious! The restaurant also serves sandwiches and pasta.

I stopped going to this chain after I had two instances of GREEN BUGS on my tomato basil pizza in a different downtown location. I still buy the frozen pizzas from time to time, but it had been ages since I set foot in any of their locations because of the bad experiences. One day, several weeks back, I decided to take my sons to ESPN Zone. After walking around for an hour, back and forth, checking my GPS like a mad woman, I discovered that ESPN Zone in Chicago is no more. (ha!) The little ones were hungry and California Pizza Kitchen was right there. Tired of walking in circles, we plopped down in a booth to order. The food and the service were both unimpressive. It was edible, but there's nothing special or even tasty about the pizzas! I was dumbfounded. Everything usually tastes better when you're hungry, but our food really was very ""meh"". Maybe I just went there on an off day, or at a bad time, but the experience left me wondering what I ever saw in this chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-2?start=80
Michael G.,"College Park, MD",431,809,599,4.0,10/20/2008,"It is extremely hard to believe that this quiet place is across the street from the insanely chaotic ESPN Zone on Ohio Street.  It's even harder to believe that this place is across from the insanely chaotic Pizzaria Uno.  What's not hard to believe is that I walked into it on a Sunday and was sat at the bar, got served, and was out the door in less than 30 minutes (as the two tourist magnets seem to draw people away from the suburban chain restaurant in the city).  Which was good because I was, as I usually am, running late for a movie as part of the Chicago International Film Festival. Now I'm as jaded as the next guy when it comes to my pizza (though I do love Pizza Hut), but California Pizza Kitchen warms my heart like the pizza oven where the pies are made in front of the customer's eyes.  There's something about its quasi-rustic interior that makes it feel different than the other chain pizza places. It had been a while since I had been to a California Pizza Kitchen so I had forgotten what it was like.  These are not so much pizzas but whatever dish you order served on a pizza crust.  I got the Greek Pizza and was greeted with a greek salad on a pie.  They had loaded on the feta and olives to the amount of a side at a Greek restaurant of the two.  And while I never pictured avocado as good on a greek salad, the vegetarian option of the pizza didn't detract from it either.  They serve it with a side of tzatziki sauce but the pizza itself covered with vinagrette dressing was already tangy enough. The prices are worthwhile for the size of the pizza (it was actually the perfect size to finish in one sitting but I'm a big eater) but I think were I not tourist averse, I would probably use the same amount of money to go to one of the nearby theme restaurants. California Pizza Kitchen is quaint and all and I can see how people who work in the area would go to a quick lunch there, but it just feels out of place where it is in terms of being a destination restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-2?start=80

Sucks that they got rid of the Carne Asada.  I remember CPK providing bread and butter - but they stopped doing that? Sarah (our waitress) didn't bring us any. To be fair, we didn't ask for any either. But still, in hindsight, I'm a bit disappointed that they didn't give me free bread....I like free stuff. =) For the first time last night, I tried the Jambalaya pasta. Very salty. I like the ingredients in it (chicken, crawfish, shrimp, veggies, etc.). But I hate the fact that they confuse salty with spicy. Folks, just because something is salty doesn't mean it's spicy!

I tried to be healthy by ordering vegetarian pizza (with goats cheese, which was good, to be fair) but to no avail. To grill vegetables they do not need to be soaked in oil! The crust is kinda gungy - and I don't understand by what logic thin crust costs $1.50 more. I dread to think what the cheeseburger pizza tastes like. Seriously. Sounds rancid.

Carolina D.,"Chicago, IL",67,45,19,2.0,8/18/2015,"So we all know downtown parking is a pain in the tush... Called to find out what their parking situation is, a young lady on the phone said they validate next door's garage. I asked if that made it free, she said yes but sounded uncertain. We decided to make it a go since they seemed to offer a solution to the parking issue. We get in, ask the hostess (seemed to be the same girl who answered the phone) if we could validate, she said at the end of the meal and it validates for 3 hours, she sounded iffy when she said it would be free again.  We had a good meal, had the Thai Chicken and Tostada pizzas. Must admit, Thai was more scrumptious since it came in their signature dough. They took off the menu a Mexican steak pizza that I would often dream of :( It was the reason for us venturing to their downtown location since they closed the one near North & Halsted. Service by Jay was good too and they deserved the extra star for that... However, the server validated our parking pass and also said parking is free. In conclusion, we were told 3 times it was free. Upon leaving the garage, the machine prompted us to pay way more than it would have cost to pay street parking for the 45 minutes we were there. We thought there was a mistake with the stamp, so we called CPK and Amber, picked up. She denied anyone would say it was free and nervously laughed throughout the conversation. Lost two customers over a garage fee they falsely admitted to be free until dinner was paid for. Felt like a bait and switch tactic.

The white corn guac w/ blue corn tortilla chips was probably my favorite.   Overall, we were content.  We came in hungry, and left full.  Waiter was friendly - even tried to crack a couple of jokes (unsuccessfully).  Most importantly, we were seated right away.  One major disappointment though: no milkshakes!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-2?start=40

CPK on Ohio St completely left me both hungry and, ultimately, sick.  With low volume on a Wednesday night, it was not super filled. Service was very attentive. However, the first surprise was a disturbing hair floating in my water.  And no,  not the hair from on top of your head....   Yea....  not very cool.  Needless to say, I ordered another water and just avoided drinking much thereafter. Then our waitress brought out the pizza - but did not give us the dough we ordered, or even the extra toppings.  So we kindly ask her to help us out.  She would keep coming to our table saying that it would only take 3-5 minutes. However, we literally waited for 1.5 hours/90min/5400seconds!!!!! There's a big difference between 3 min and 90 min.  :-)  (CPK claimed that there were lots of orders and that our ""newly made pizza"" kept being taken by other servers).  By that time, my table lost most of its appetite and was late for a movie. Most shockingly of all, CPK did not even try to give a discount on the initial check.  No sorry,  no apology,  just the full price staring at us.   With unsanitary waters, incorrect pizzas, long waits, making my table late for a movie,  NO DISCOUNT??!!     I talked to the manager and he apologized for the server and helped with 20% which was very kind of him.  Once we all made it to Loews for the movie, we felt queezy in our stomachs and we later felt horribly sick (one girl had to throw up).  CPK needs to improve their hygiene and work on customer service.

This location can get particularly crowded (though I think it was because I was there during the Chicago Lights Festival), but I think it is because of it's great food and prices.  There is a Grand Luxe down the street somewhere and a Pizzeria Uno across the street, but I will always make a bee-line to CPK cause I just would.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-2?start=100

Tom S.,"Chicago, IL",104,212,5,5.0,8/19/2008,"Before we begin, please know that I am a huge Chicago pizza fan ... so what's the deal with a 5 star review for California Pizza Kitchen!? I'm giving CPK 5 stars because they do what they do better than anybody else: creating California cuisine pizza. In a town where the battle between thin and thick and Uno's and Giordano's rages on hard and fast, California Pizza Kitchen has carved its own niche and creates perfectly delicious and consistent pizzas, appetizers, salads and more. I prefer this location over others in and around Chicago. The first time I ever had CPK pizza was in Santa Barbara CA, the home of California Pizza Kitchen, before they expanded to become a nationwide restaurant. There is just something about this Ohio Street venue that speaks to that first experience, and that probably starts with the service. The staff at Ohio Street is friendly, personable, professional and efficient. From the moment you walk in you are immediately welcomed and, all things being equal, you are seated. The booths are roomy and comfortable and the tables have always been spotless. Waitstaff is knowledgeable and they are quick to take your order, or wait as you wish. The kitchen is quick and you really never have to wait very long for your pizza. The real advantage that this chain has over other comfort food chains is the consistency of California cuisine pizza. It's pizza ... from a chain ... but they've created truly unique flavor combinations on a truly tasty and chewy crust. And it doesn't really matter where you go, you can pretty much rely on the fact that your favorite CPK pizza is going to taste the same no matter where you go. Fresh ingredients, delicious sauces, real cheese, you can't go wrong. If it's your first outing, try to find something on the menu to order, don't lament the lack of the sausage and peppers pizza. There are new flavors to find here. Try the barbecue chicken or the carne asada [a personal favorite]. Don't skip on appetizers; the beautiful shrimp rolls are translucent, generous and delicious. My favorite salad is the BBQ Chopped Chicken. A nice alternative when you don't want to load up on pizza crust carbs. The bottom line is that even a diehard Chicago pizza fan can find a place in his heart ... and his stomach ... for some California Pizza Kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-2?start=100

It was nice to be able to walk in, have a seat, have full wait service and not take up an entire table. You also have a front row seat to watch them make the salads and pizzas. Keeps them honest at least.  As per CPK, the portions are large. I had half of an Original Chopped and a 5 cheese pizza. I knew I really wanted the salad and only a piece of the pizza and that I would also need lunch for the next day so it all worked out.

Katelyn C.,"Denver, CO",88,239,25,3.0,4/13/2011,"I have been to many CPK's and by far this one is the most popular.  It seems like every time I am in the neighborhood it is super busy.  The music was so loud that everyone was screaming across tables to hold a conversation; which made the whole restaurant too loud to handle.  We waited quite a bit longer than we were told, but I completely understand because we asked to specifically sit by the door so as my friend could run outside to a quieter setting to take an important phone call.  I really hate complaining about service but here it goes:  my mom came to join us, but first she asked the hostess where the bathroom was.  She replied that is was for customers but pointed her in the right direction.  Our server was nice but very busy, so when I disliked my drink I went straight to the bar.  The bartender didn't try the drink I wanted him to remake, just simply remade the same drink all over again, so as it tasted exactly the same as the one I disliked.  I feel the drinks are overpriced for the amount of alcohol you get, as well.   My pizza was a little cold, but still tasted amazing!  I probably will not go to this cpk again because I seem to have the same complaints every time.  So instead of writing bad reviews I will go to a less busy cpk and get the same food with a different outcome! ****TOURISTS: please don't eat here.

Austin S.,"Fairfax, VA",0,6,,1.0,7/2/2015,"I write this extraordinarily disappointed with my experience. A few friends and I came in nearing closing for this CPK location and were seated after being given the run around by two hostesses. Once seated my company and I were not helped for at least 10 minutes, being ignored by passing servers. Once we decided enough was enough we went to order carry out instead. We were helped after another wait and were told that our requests for food would be processed appropriately. However, half way through receiving our order the associate disappeared into the kitchen without so much as an ""excuse me a moment"". He came back with another employee and said ""uhhhmmmmmmm yeah we're closed."" We could have been refused at the door at 10 minutes before closing. But instead our time was wasted in the way it was. A horrendous experience. I choose to patronize this establishment at any location any further. I encourage others to follow suit. A poor reflection of middle management and therefore the whole outfit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-2?start=60
Vineet S.,"Jersey City, NJ",1748,948,1548,1.0,7/6/2010,"Finally went to CPK on lazy sunny afternoon. I would want to discuss the service first rather than the food. They did gave a table of our choice to us. But after that the server forgot we were ready for our order and nobody came to our table for 15 minutes not even to ask if we need water or something else. Finally I had to go up the service desk and tell them to send somebody to take our order. We ordered BBQ Chicken,Buffalo Chicken and Thai Chicken pizza. The food was OK not that great, being in the city of Chicago we have a couple of good options for pizza than CPK. We asked for some extra ketchup, which they gave us when we were about to finish our pizzas.That's damm slow. While refilling my Sierra Mist the server accidently gave me a glass of plain soda.  So I would give them a thumbs down in terms of service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-2?start=60

Brenda D.,"Austin, TX",1,15,,1.0,9/25/2015,"What terrible customer service. Online it says they offer free delivery within a 3 block radius for a minimum order of $15. Great. I set up my online order and then it only gives pick up options. I call to place my order when the woman very rudely tells me the minimum order is $50. I referenced the website and she said ""people have to call to place delivery orders and that's when we tell them it's $50."" Well, that needs to be updated because it's misleading, untrue and I've wasted all of my time trying to get lunch from CPK.

Anuj S.,"Chicago, IL",164,627,2,4.0,4/9/2010,"It's hard to compare CPK to any other type of restaurant or cuisine.  I wouldn't even call it pizza, but they do have some great stuff. For starters, you wouldn't think it, but the hummus has got to be the best.  It's really strange, because it's not even a Mediterranean-themed place.  The bread they bring out in the beginning is also good.  For the main course, my all-time favorite here is the Tostada pizza.  Wow... what a concept!  It's a perfect blend of a sort of Mexican flavored salad on top of the pizza base.  Delicious! Hmmm... I haven't been there for a while now.  Gotta get back there now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-2?start=60

They were LOUD and vulgar and demanding and their server did not seem to notice or care. Our server also did not seem to notice or care that we (and the people in the table to our left) were extremely unhappy due to the disturbance. The food came out quick enough and was a big enough portion, just kind of... mundane.

He just wasn't paying attention to our table, so we stayed for much longer than we wanted. The other thing was that we went closer to the time they were supposed to close and there was hardly anyone there. I've been to a restaurant that's been 3 times more crowded and I still got better service.

When I looked at the menu I was so thrown off by all the different types of pizzas there were. I was like "" there are some things that shoudnt be on a pizza"". But that has all changed. The pizza's at CPK are great! Carne Asada and Sante Fe Chicken are my favorite. Plus the Spring Rolls are pretty damn good. Plus get the pizza on the wheat dough and you will enjoy the pizza even more!

Jody C.,"Chicago, IL",9,127,,5.0,5/21/2007,"I loved this place growing up in L.A. and it still makes me happy every time i got there. I've had to trick/force Chicago natives to try it, but they've all been pleasantly surprised. No, its not deep dish and its not your typical pizza. Its California style pizza and pasta. The menu has a lot of different choices, and you can get some tasty pasta if you absolutely refuse to try non-Chicago pizza. Get the Baja and Thai rolls as appetizers! Love them!  Service at this location can be a little slow, but not bad. Plus the manager is a Sox fan so the game is always on the tvs. Drinks are pretty good and there usually isnt a wait since the tourists are trying the Chicago pizza and most Chicago native are too snobby to try other kinds of pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-2?start=140
C J.,"Chicago, IL",0,17,18,4.0,6/14/2011,I went here on a date a few weeks ago. It was not crowded so our dining experience was great! We were seated quickly and and the wait time for our dishes were average (maybe 20 minutes). I ordered the California Club Sandwich which comes with a Caesar salad. Both were great! The bread on the sandwich was the best I have had on any sandwich so far! It's so good you could eat it by itself. The sandwich came with avocados which I have not tried prior to dining here. I will pass on avocados from now on with any dish. The dishes are also reasonably priced. Our bill was close to $35 with tax and tips without drinks and dessert.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-2?start=140

Jennifer L.,"IL, IL",1,17,,4.0,4/8/2007,"If you're not that into Chicago-style pizza then this is the place for you. They have some fairly traditional toppings such as Hawaai, Pepperoni etc, as well as more unusual ones such as Thai or even salad. There is also a large choice of pasta too, as well as a couple of chicken entrees and quite a few salads.  The vegetarian pizza I had was one of the best vege pizzas I've had in ages, although I ended up bringing half home as it was very filling so a pretty good deal at $11. My husband had the fettucine which at the menu price of $11 sounded a bit boring, and which ended up expensive once he added chicken and mushrooms for $15. The kids meals however were well priced at $5, including milk or apple juice as alternatives to soda, which is nice as we usually have to buy her a separate drink as most kids meals normally only include soda.  The desserts - my daughters 99c sundae was better than the $6 we ordered, but both were good.  Everyone was really friendly, even though it was fairly busy. The food came quite quickly and was hot and fresh.  The decor is a little dated but it looks like it's been there a while. It's clean and simple however and it works.
