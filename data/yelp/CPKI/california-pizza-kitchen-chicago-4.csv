Tuyen T.,"Chicago, IL",112,178,51,4.0,8/19/2009,"Not my first time at CPK, but I never wrote a review for it before. Stopped by around 6:30 on Sunday - beat the crowd! Got the spring roll appetizer - one baja and one thai. The baja one came with a gauc sauce and the thai one came with a peanut sauce. It was good & recommended by our waiter, who had a long day at work =( boo hoo, I love waiters who talk to you. Also got the BBQ Chicken pizza which was good. Good amount of food for two people to get full but not over stuffed. Service was good, considering the amount of people and there were only two waiters.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-4
Jenna S.,"Chicago, IL",788,1311,69,5.0,9/11/2008,"Three words: Thai Chicken Pizza. Best.  Ever. I love CPK.  I frequent the CPK in Oakbrook Mall, but will occasionally venture out and go to another branch.  I've been to the Watertower Place branch a few times and it's always delicious.   Every CPK looks almost exactly the same, so there's nothing unique or exciting about the interior.  It's a modern looking place with a lot of pictures on the walls and dark wood panels throughout.  The service at this location has always been friendly and fast, which is really nice if you're trying to have a quick lunch in order to get back to your shopping.   The food is amazing.  I love all of their pizzas and they always have some unique ideas.  A lot of restaurants have the same kinds of pizzas now, but I think CPK was one of the original chain restaurants to go with this idea.  The Thai Chicken Pizza is my absolute favorite because it's just the right blend of amazing chicken, veggies and cheese with a nice, very light and subtle peanut sauce.  Seriously delicious.  Their Tortilla Soup is also amazing as well as the Split Pea.  They also make great salads.  All in all, you'll never get stuck with something you don't like because everything on the menu is great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-4
Shradha A.,"Chicago, IL",683,2108,181,3.0,7/6/2009,"I'm generally a HUUUUGE CPK fan and I believe has listed it as one of my last-meal-on-earth options! But this particular CPK doesn't cut it for me...  The service is slow, distracted and nonchalant. The servers don't know much about the menu or the food - for example what is vegetarian and what is not - and the food just comes out very slow.  I'd much rather visit the one on Ohio, across the street from ESPN Zone for my dose of CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-4
Eddie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",99,64,3,4.0,1/22/2009,"Now I don't have many weaknesses, but I gotta admit, CPK is one of them. Actually I have a lot of weaknesses, but CPK is one of my biggest. I love the variety and overall flavor of their menu. When it comes to pizza, there are so many to choose from, and I've never really been disappointed with any of them. I'm even hard-pressed to pick a favorite. My favorite appetizer is the Lettuce Wraps, those are mad good. Their salads are great too...Original Chopped BBQ salad is a classic. And I love the mixed grilled salad with grilled salmon added....except it seems pretty expensive for a CPK salad (~$16-17 w/ the salmon). I even like their pastas, especially the Fusili with Broccoli, Sund-dried Tomatoes, and chicken added. Very clean and doesn't overpower with richness like some of the other pastas. A go-to favorite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-4
Kaaren D.,"Newbury Park, CA",593,1103,980,4.0,1/20/2008,"Tucked into the end of the hall at Water Tower Place, service was fast, early in the evening, and typical CPK fare.  The spinach artichoke dip was yummy, and more than enough for two of us.  Everywhere I see a field green salad with pears, walnuts and gorgonzola cheese on the menu, I try it, and this was one of the best I have tried.  The BBQ chicken pizza was great, and the goat cheese pizza even tasted good the next day for breakfast.  We accompanied our meal with the Ravenswood red zinfandel.   Good alternative in Water Tower to Food Life downstairs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-4
Trinidad F.,"Maywood, IL",200,113,4,3.0,5/21/2008,"I love CPK and the pizza there but today I decided to get something different. I started with peach flavored ice tea and my friend Mario got raspberry ice tea.  When we got our teas we searched for the flavor....lol. Mine tasted nothing like anything that is even ""peach colored"".  Same with his. I decided on Fettucini Alfredo with garlic sauce which is different from the usual tomato basil pizza that I get.  Mario got the pepperoni pizza. Service was quick.  We got our food in about 10 minutes.  His pizza looked very nice but my fettucini looked dry and dead.  I tasted it and the garlic sauce was amazing but the pasta was dry and a bit overcooked, slightly cold. The overall flavor was good but the texture of the pasta was dead. Overcooked!!!  I don't recommend the pasta to anyone who doesnt want massive garlic breathe afterwards. lol.  I hope the cook was just having a bad day because I really love this place or maybe pasta just isnt his thing? LOL.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-4
Serena V.,"Chicago, IL",0,10,,3.0,3/8/2011,"3 stars for loving the place (until now). Their Singapore Shrimp Rolls were the best appetizers I've had ANYWHERE. I go out of my way all the time to have them. Tried them at other restaurants, tried making my own, etc - NOTHING COMPARES. Last time I went I found out that they've DISCONTINUED THEM. Sorry CPK, you've lost a customer forever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-4
Amy J.,"Chicago, IL",30,296,,4.0,4/11/2008,"I love CPK. This one is in the middle of Water Tower place. I actually thought it would be more crowded because of that, but it wasn't too bad. My favorites here: Spinach Artichoke Dip, White Pizza, and Garlic Chicken Pizza. So good. The white pizza is garlic, and white cheeses (including ricotta) and spinach... It's soooo good. The Garlic Chicken pizza doesn't use a typical sauce, and instead has kind of a garlic butter sauce topped with cheese and chicken. To die for. I think they sell this version in grocery stores. The white pizza is also sold in grocery stores, but not nearly as good as the restaurant (for some reason they make it on thin crust in the grocery store, but at the actual CPK its on normal crust). Anyways, it's definitely good. I guess the only minus is that you have to enter the mall to go to this one. But there area plenty of other locations if you want to avoid that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-4
Angelica D.,"Chicago, IL",5,95,2,3.0,3/2/2009,"The pizza is good. The only reason i eat here is because its next to my job. The service is good too.  The buffalo chicken pizza is really good. I'm also a fan of their soups. I like that i can order online and just pick up when i'm ready. The prices are a bit much though because after all its just pizza, but oh well its chicago so yeah.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-4
Marvin G.,"Frederick, MD",5,47,2,3.0,2/15/2009,"I had a Half of Cobb salad. It was plentiful. The only problem was the lettuce had brown spots all over it. Strangely the salad was chopped so small I had to use a spoon to eat it. That was kind of weird, but it worked. Price was reasonable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-4
Bridgette K.,"Chicago, IL",89,332,32,1.0,2/23/2009,The cesear salad had brown spots. The pizza was flavorless and gross. Was very disappointed from my visit here and will never return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-4
