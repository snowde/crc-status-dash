Kristina B.,"Chicago, IL",102,331,2,4.0,8/23/2007,"CPK. Your BBQ chicken pizza puts me into a food coma time and time again. Your Sicilian pizza makes me cry...out of JOY, of course. And your ice cream-topped brownie sends me into orgasm-ville. The service has always been good. And the prices are decent/average. Huh-zzah! :) The location is cool, too. Lots of shopping to be done around there to help wake you up from your foodie-stuper.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-6?start=20
Rachelle G.,"Chicago, IL",91,420,,4.0,8/5/2006,"CPK is a great place to go for a lighter dinner.  My friend and I were full after splitting a pizza and half a salad.  They have so many choices that I have a hard time thinking that a person could not find one thing to help fill an empty stomach. Service is on-point; not overtly aggressive, but they seem to pop up when you need a refill, etc. Definitely a place I return to when I'm in the neighborhood and craving a light pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-6?start=20
Alex F.,"Park Forest, IL",437,204,1,4.0,1/5/2008,"Yes, after all my ranting about Chicago style pizza, I went to CPK. I had a gift card!! But seriously, I figured I would be open-minded and judge it as a restaurant, not as a pizza place. Kind of like I won't judge cheap Italian food as Italian food, just as food, because my mom's is infinitely better. Neat modern decor (black leather, wood, glass, and steel). My server was honestly too polite and proper for a place like this - he belonged at a much nicer restaurant - but I won't complain. They do have a shit-ton of themed pizzas, like Greek, Jamaican, Thai, Mexican, hippie, vegetarian, etc. as well as some Italian-style pizzas that I dared not try (see above). They also serve beer and wine (instant plus). The pizza size is somewhat awkward - bigger than an average eater could finish in one sitting, but not quite big enough for two. If you're here with two I would recommend a round of appetizers first. If you take into account the aforementioned information about portion size, the prices aren't bad at all. I'd give it 3.5-4.0, so I'll round up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-6?start=20
Josh G.,"Highland Park, IL",89,230,,4.0,9/15/2009,"Surprisingly good pizza for a chain.  All the times I've been out and about shopping on North Ave. I've never stopped at CPK because I just didn't think it would be that great.  But this weekend I was pleasantly surprised.  This location is great, especially if you've been shopping like crazy and need to take a break.  Bright, clean, spacious, friendly, and the pizza was actually quite good.  I actually struggled with all the different options but eventually settled on a great pizza.  Loved the crust.  Hot, fresh, soft, and had a great overall flavor.  Screw the rules!  Review chain restaurants!  You may find something you like.  I did.  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-6?start=20
Angel E.,"Chicago, IL",5,16,,1.0,1/5/2009,"This place sucks! Never been there before, thought about going there before or expected to go there but, alas, we got a gift card that needed to be used.   Ironically enough, everything we had other than the pizza was okay.  We ordered a cup of asparagus soup- it had croutons- it was pretty good.  We had a little salad with pears and gorgonzola cheese and candied walnuts- also pretty good. I'm giving one star for the apps. The pizza- the namesake BBQ Chicken pizza in fact- was absolutely horrible.  The toppings were tasteless- the chicken couldn't have been ickier, more spongy, more obviously freeze-dried- and the crust was even worse- wonky, wavy, not even a hint of crisp.  Bad news.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-6?start=20

Arlene G.,"Oak Park, IL",93,905,,4.0,2/17/2010,"I love this place and have been tryin 2 get my girlfriend to go with me for a long time. She said this place doesn't have ""real pizza"" cuz of all the different types of pizza they offer. I keep tellin her that that's what makes it so good! Anyway, she finally agreed to go since we were in this area last night. I ordered my fave, Thai chicken pizza and she got a plain pepperoni pizza. We ordered the dumplings for an appetizer and they were ok, nothing spectacular. After I had her try my pizza, why does she end up eating 2 more slices of mine!? She didn't even finish her pepperoni pizza cuz she ate mine! I thought she hated this place huh!? I converted her and now she likes it, but claims she wouldn't go if it wasn't for me. I also ordered the chocolate banana cake and it was deeeeelish! She had the apple crisp with ice cream, of course, and it was pretty good too. We also received great service from out waiter, David H. He was so attentive and very thoughtful with us. We definitely told his manager how awesome he was and appreciated the great customer service since you don't always get it. I admit the food here seems a bit pricey for what you're getting, but I like the unique pizza types so I don't mind paying a bit more for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-6?start=20

Audra S.,"Las Vegas, NV",183,316,299,4.0,8/14/2005,"CPK is consistently great pizza, albeit pretty pricey.  They have some potent cocktails on their menu in addition to salads and sandwiches, so you really can't go wrong with a fussy group of diners.  This North Avenue location validates parking, which is a bonus for all you driving maniacs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-6?start=20
Jennifer K.,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",247,370,,3.0,4/6/2006,"I hail from Cali, so I felt obliged to visit the CPK in the Chi.  As a chain restaurant, I expect the same service here as I had received in LA...and yes, it was the same.  We still had to wait about 5-10 minutes for seating.  But otherwise, our server was very attentive.  When I asked for new straws and clean napkins, he brought them immediately. Now, my favorite dishes are the sesame ginger chicken dumplings, focaccia with checca, barbeque chicken pizza, bolognese linguini, and sedona tortilla soup.  Their menu is pretty extensive.  And I have never ordered anything on the menu that tasted bad. The price is decent and the food's great.  It's a good place for group dinners.  CPK is consistent with their service and food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-6?start=20
Kristen C.,"Chicago, IL",132,421,49,5.0,10/26/2006,"The food and service at the North Avenue California Pizza Kitchen are both excellent.  Even on a busy Saturday night, we were able to get a table at CPK. The view, if you get a table by the window, is interesting - looking over North Avenue is never dull! The pizza at CPK is good. I highly recommend the thin and crispy crust pizzas, especially the margharita pizza and the tricolore pizza (with added rosemary grilled chicken on top). The white bean hummus served with pizza bread is extraordinary. The mixed greens salad (with pears, nuts, and a special balsamic vinaigrette) and the tortilla soup are divine.  If you watch your portion size and order well, CPK can be a delicious, healthy meal out. If you park in the garage, CPK will give you validation for parking under 2 hours. CPK also offer curb-side carry-out. When you park on the 3rd floor of the parking garage, CPK service people will bring out your order to your car.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-6?start=20

Anyway, it was better than I thought it would be. The waiter was great - always topping off the coffees, etc. The vegetarian asparagus soup was a delightful surprise. It is one of my faves and they didn't do me wrong. The flavor was light and textured. The vegetable panini sandwich was also great. My co-workers ordered desserts and said they were very yummy!

G V.,"Marina del Rey, CA",179,26,2,1.0,2/11/2010,"I give this review because of the deceptive nutritional value of their food. I ordered a lettuce wrap chicken appetizer, which, I thought was low cal. Boy was I wrong! It's 911 calories, well over the daily limit of sodium, 19 grams of fat! E gads!  I could have eaten a pizza for that. It must have all been fried. Although nowhere on the description does it state that.  Honestly, a McDonalds cheeseburger might have been about the same nutritional value.  Word to the wise, if you are monitoring what you eat, look up the nutritional values in advance.

You'll have everyone from moms and kids, to business folks to people off from work.... wait why are you off of work? Even on a Friday or Saturday night there will be boys and girls ordering food before they are off and chugging shots and making out. The salads are fresh, the pizza is good, not phenomenal, but good.

Karen L.,"Chicago, IL",8,66,1,5.0,3/13/2006,"All I can say is MMM!  California Pizza Kitchen has some of the most delicious and clever pizza dishes ever devised.  CPK is a very clean, warm environment where they make you feel right at home.  I enjoy their Thai chicken pizza more than anything.  If you've never had that, pizza sauce has been replaced by peanut sauce and topped with mozzarella, chicken, clinatro, bean sprouts, carrots, and green onions.  Heavenly.  My friend enjoys their white pizza, a sauceless dish covered with parmesean, feta, and such things, and their baked potato pizza, which is just what it sounds like.  The restaurant also carries some equally interesting salads, pastas, and appetizers. This location is a bit less crowded than the one off the Mag Mile and as a result is a little friendlier.  Great for family and friends.  The only draw back is the price: the pizzas are somewhat bigger than your average personal pan, about 6 slices, and cost around $10 each.  Don't worry, they make up for it in flavor and fresh ingredients.  You absolutely must try this mouth-watering restaurant!  Edit: (As a quick note, their cheese pizza is actually the only thing that doesn't taste so great.  Odd, yes?)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-6?start=40

The soft chocolate cake is layered with a banana cream filling and drizzled with hot fudge and banana cream excellence! If only it was low cal or something fat free, I'd eat it every day of my life.  The coffee was hot, smooth and a perfect accompaniment to my slice of heaven. The service was excellent as the GM was the one behind the counter the entire time and there wasn't a busy crowd at all with the exception of the revolving door of take out customers. I'd recommend this place for a quick bite or for fast take out service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-6
John T.,"Chicago, IL",267,630,2,3.0,1/25/2011,"Stopped in awhile back when I was going to register for some summer classes at DePaul (woohoo).  A friend and I had gone in and ordered some Margherita pizzas, wings, and drinks and thought that everything was just ""Eh.""  I have been to plenty of other CPKs, including the best one in the West Bloomfield, MI, but this one falls well short of that one on many levels.  The service was quite slow, and the food was really nothing specialfor the price.  All in all, it is a clean place with a nice feel.  Parking is in the connected garage, but be sure to validate or you'll be in trouble later because that is just another headache.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-6
Andrea R.,"Glencoe, IL",3363,2584,1179,3.0,8/26/2006,"I used to be a huge fan of CPK when I was young and living in Florida. It seems silly to come here now that I live in Chicago and am surrounded by so many restaurants, but I can always count on CPK for a good meal.  We had lunch here today and I tried the new thai chicken salad that my boyfriend has really enjoyed during past visits to CPK. It was really good, although definitely a little on the spicy side.   This location is much better than the downtown location...it seems much cleaner and the service is pretty good.  Today it appeared to be almost empty, same with the last few times I've come here, but at least we were able to get a table immediately at noon on a Saturday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-6
Kori M.,"Atlanta, GA",127,389,5,3.0,6/21/2007,This is one of my favorites. This place is very good at one thing - CONSISTENCY.  I had lunch there today and it was pretty good. I had the California Club pizza. The Caesar salad is excellent. I also like the white pizza and the Jamaican jerk chicken pizza. Very big variety on the drink menu.  The service was good. The only drawback is this place is crawling with rug-rats. Every time I've come it's been some little kid's birthday and of course he (or she) has to have like 8 little friends. It's soooo noisy!  Other than that this is a cool place. Check it out!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-6
Devin C.,"Chicago, IL",9,38,,1.0,3/18/2010,"My ladyfriend and I hit up this pizza spot on a whim the other night. The pizza was average and served a bit cold, and overpriced for the size.  Niether of us like to raise a ruckus, but my gal found spit in her drink as soon as she got to the bottom.  For what?  I'm not too sure.  But we got the hell out of dodge after that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-6
Mallory S.,"Chicago, IL",13,25,7,4.0,5/6/2011,"Yum Yum Yum! My mom and I use to love to go to CPK when I lived in Alabama, so when she came to visit me last weekend in Chicago we went to this location and left very happy and very full (with leftovers to spare!)  I recommend the Wild Mushroom Pizza with the honey wheat crust. The Pear and Gorgonzola was reallyyyyyy good too. Also, I tried the Asian Plum martini- fantastic! Perfect spring-time martini. Our waiter (wish I remembered his name) was great too. Very friendly, great sense of humor. Guess you have to be a happy person to work a slow Sunday night shift. Only thing I wasn't happy about was the 1 hour free parking. Maybe some people can make it out before an hour, but i'm a slow eater.. Luckily the parking is only $5.25 after the first hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-6
Lesley A.,"Downers Grove, IL",102,320,61,2.0,6/13/2010,"Meeeeehhhh... This was my second time trying California Pizza Kitchen and I just haven't been impressed with the pizza. Looking at the other reviews, I think the key is not order pizza! I had the Original BBQ Chicken pizza which was forgettable by the time I left the restaurant. The Avocado Club Eggrolls appetizer (a fusion of East and West with fresh avocado, chicken, tomato, Monterey Jack cheese and applewood smoked bacon, wrapped in a crispy wonton roll. Served with ranchito sauce and our herb ranch dressing) is totally the way to go!  The CPK is nicely located in the crux of that building that has Banana Republic, Express, Victoria Secret and J. Crew. It's sort of pricey, but less expensive than other establishments in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-6
Rich B.,"Hoboken, NJ",1,59,12,5.0,8/31/2011,I really liked it. Had a great pizza and awesome desserts. The place was really crowded with decibel levels uncomfortable at times. But overall I had a good time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-6
Jen N.,"Chicago, IL",60,214,1,5.0,2/28/2009,"I don't care, and yes it is sort of silly to review a chain restaurant, but I have a confession- I LOVE cpk.  It is the shizzznit. I really do like this restaurant a lot.  The Pear and Gorgonzola pizza (with wheat crust) is great and so are the salads, like the Asian salad, the Tequila pasta is also popular.  I have been here many times and never been unhappy with the food or large slection, or the cocktails.   This particular restaurant is not in a special location, there is no view out the window, and it is basically in the building with a Crunch Gym and a huge parking garage... but the food is just good.  It is a good place to go with a friend or family for lunch or dinner, it's near shopping. So in conclusion, I love CPK  and will defend it to the death.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-6
lesley s.,"Beverly Hills, MI",29,96,,4.0,12/2/2008,"I always feel a little silly reviewing a chain restaurant, like I lose a little city credibility every time I admit to eating at a chain. But yelping is all about honesty, right? And I like the 'za at CPK. The tortilla soup is yummy and a cup is the perfect amount of food to hold you over until your pizza arrives. I used to always order the Tostada (black beans, cheese, crispy tortilla strips, tomatoes, lettuce, ranch), but tonight I tried a delicious alternative: the Thai chicken pizza. I also tried the honey-wheat crust for the first time, which was quite good. Now, I see all the reviews that say this place is no good, but I think my fellow yelpers may be coming at it from the wrong angle. I will admit that it's a little overpriced -- I was shocked that my friend's field greens salad with shrimp cost more than my pizza, but that just means you need to survey the whole menu to get a little more bang for your buck. I would never bring an out-of-towner to CPK but when the suburbanite in me cries out for a little TLC, I keep coming back.  *Note, I also have a friend who is an extremely picky eater who is very difficult to go out to eat with, and she loves CPK. I know that not everyone is an adventurous eater, so this is a pretty good compromise for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-6
Sari G.,"San Francisco, CA",112,188,11,2.0,7/16/2007,"Perhaps this is an unfair review - but since this is a huge corporation I have little Mercy. I am from California and have had CA pizza kitchen my entire life. Its where all the cool kids hung out in LA and tried to work their first job. It is a travesty that California Pizza Kitchen is in Chicago! Although, If you are ever dragged here, you may want to try the chocolate souffle. Otherwise I say - this chain has a lot of badly run duds and is so passe.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-6
J. N.,"Chicago, IL",18,163,8,1.0,1/4/2008,"I have been to CPK three times, all of which were at this location.  I don't understand the good reviews, this place is really awful. Food - Its good yes, but why the pre-cooked, frozen, thawed chicken on the salads and soups?   Price - Why would I EVER order a $17 salad?  Why is the $13 salad so freaking small for $13?  I mean, for that price, I thought I could get two meals out of it.   Atmosphere - Contrived and boring. Service-  Always less then mediocre. Seriously, pass on this place.  The food and poor service is NOT worth the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-6

Mason G.,"Austin, TX",6,24,,1.0,8/22/2006,"Well it seems my review is going to be contrary to the popular opinion here. My experience at California Pizza Kitchen was unsatisfactory. The service was sub-par and get this, they didn't have any black olives! What kind of pizza place doesn't have black olives? The food seemed overpriced and didn't taste like anything terribly special.  If you're looking for a quality restaurant to enjoy pizza, I wouldn't waste your time at California Pizza Kitchen. Rarely do I leave a restaurant feeling almost completely unsatisfied but this is how I left feeling from CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-6
Milie S.,"IL, IL",0,14,,4.0,1/29/2007,DELICIOUS!  I frequent this restaurant quite often and have yet to have any major complaints.

California Club Pasta? Chicken Tequila Fettuccine Salad? BBQ Chicken,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-6
ER S.,"Chicago, IL",0,142,,4.0,3/19/2009,"I am definitely not a chain restaurant person... but of all the chain restaurant, this is one of my favorites. It is EXTREMELY kid friendly.  When it's a weeknight and I want to go out with my five year old, this is the place.  I get the Tricolore Salad Pizza and a glass of wine, and she gets crayons and a coloring / activity book, a fun cup for her milk, and a bowl of pasta.  It's a win-win, with free parking to boot (eat fast, it's only 1 hour free). My only criticism, really, is that it's always cold in there.  This seems to be a CPK problem in all their locations.  Is it possibly part of their schtick to be highly air-conditioned?  Does that evoke California in some way?  It's a mystery.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-6
