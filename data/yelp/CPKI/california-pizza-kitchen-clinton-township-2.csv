Eddie A.,"Macomb, MI",11,75,19,4.0,9/14/2015,"Loved this place when I was stationed in Hawaii, and am pleased to see it is still the same here in Michigan. Awesome food for those who don't have to eat fatty style food. Good, healthy choices on the menu allow for a guilt free experience. The white pizza is just too good and needs to be tried by everyone... this pizza makes the experience worth while. Hummus and Calimari make it a well rounded meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-clinton-township-2?start=20
Abir C.,"Charter Township of Clinton, MI",4,2,,5.0,5/24/2016,The staff was great. They were happy to serve great people. The food was AMAZING the Belgian chocolate cake was the best part I highly recommend it if you want something great. Anchor part of this was the brownie was freshly baked.

Stacy Z.,"Glendale, AZ",29,296,29,3.0,1/5/2014,"Really wanted to like this place, but it was just ok. I ordered a lunch combo of baked potato soup and the 4 cheese pizza. Now I get that cheese is salty, but holy salt bomb. It was the only flavor I could taste on the whole pizza. I also didn't really love the crust- too bread-y and they couldn't sub it out for a flatbread crust. The avocado egg rolls were good, and the pasta looked delicious but my friend said it wasn't very garlicky. His cranberry soda was way too much soda water and not enough cranberry. Oh, and this place is LOUD. Echo city even though it wasn't unbearably crowded.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-clinton-township-2?start=20

Shanita M.,"Waterford Township, MI",47,157,5,2.0,4/17/2013,"I love CPK, but was very disappointed with the food at this one. We went Saturday night at about 7:30pm and called ahead to reserve. We waited only about two minutes before being seated, and the staff was super friendly. I got my usual, the waldorf salad and the shrimp zucchini fettuccine. The BF got his usual Hawaiian pizza. The salad was really skimpy, there were only little bits of all the ingredients in it. The fettuccine was super watery and the zucchini slices were huge (they're supposed to be pasta sized).  When he got his pizza he said it smelled like a totino's microwavable one, and did look like one! There was no char or anything to make it look handmade or even cooked in a kitchen. I would have given them one star except that the staff was so nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-clinton-township-2?start=20
Olivia W.,"Mount Clemens, MI",16,21,3,4.0,8/19/2015,"I came here for dinner last night with a friend. Service was very friendly! We ordered our drinks and my friends had a hair on the straw so they took it back but kept it on the bill. We ordered the tostado pizza and the BBQ salad. The food was delicious! The BBQ salad is my favorite, I will definitely be getting it again. The tostado pizza was mediocre. It wasn't bad but wasn't delicious.

Eric A.,"Charter Township of Clinton, MI",23,78,20,1.0,12/31/2014,Stopped in since it wasn't crowded.  That should have been a clue.    The service was poor at best.  Appetizer and entrees were served at the same time.  We had to ask for plates and utensils.    Trying get a refill was a was almost impossible.   Then our check gets dropped off mid meal and not 5 minutes later the wait staff want to take the check up.  They are not getting a good tip and you lost my party's after dinner adult beverages sales and what my party was going to order for desert.   I can't remember when I have had worse service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-clinton-township-2?start=20
Dave F.,"Almont, MI",1,33,2,4.0,1/5/2015,"Recently went to CPK for a small family get together after the new year. There were seven of us so I tried to make reservations (as yelp said they accepted them),after I was told they don't do reservations but I could call ahead that was the plan. Well call ahead was useless.  Now why 4 stars, the manager to make up for our wait, gave us two appetizers, the server was personable and knowledgeable.  The food was good, we had six different pizzas at our table and not many leftovers.

Regina S.,"Hazel Park, MI",447,252,48,4.0,11/13/2011,"Dinner with my Diva Queen daughter Saturday night!!  We actually wanted to go to PF Changs, but didn't feel like waiting an hour so we walked over here and they had us in a booth in minutes. It's a cool place; trendy but not snobby. Comfortable.  We settled right in after my daughter was asked if she wanted a kid's menu.  LOL she's 12 and the menu is for 10 and under. We considered this a total bonus and she played right along. We ordered one of the small plate apps of fried mac and cheese.  Diva Queen LOVED them!! I thought they were OK, good breading, but the ones in Mackinac are pretty hard to beat.  Also, they put some ""cheese"" sauce on the plate, but it was like Velveeta and just congealed there.  Needed some tomato or something.  They were a little gummy for me. She ordered the Hawaiian pizza and I ordered the Carnitas Habanero pizza.   Food came out pretty quick which was great !  My pizza was shredded pork, with cilantro, 2 cheeses, pesto, and red onion...with a habanero salsa on the side. The pizza alone is fucking STELLAR if you ask me!!! Awesome thin crust.  You could bite through that pork easier than pepperoni and it tasted delicious!! The salsa  is kinda way hella-fucking HOT.  And they give you way too much of it.   Not hot like the hot at Lenny's Sub (see review) but just ""Ow my fucking lips are burning, make it stop!!""   I think I actually tried ""tapping out"" by hitting the table a few times.  (well gee Reggie, it's Habanero for shit's sake!!) Duh!!!"" I know.  Shut up.  It was interesting, but to me, I think the pizza held it on it's own.  The gimmick of the hot salsa is great for thrill seekers though!  D Q loved the crust on hers, it was traditional crust. She said the pizza was good but was having a hard time with the toppings falling off. I asked her if she wanted to come back and she said definitely so I think we have  a winner!! With 2 Pepsis it came out to $30.00 and that was with her kids menu pizza, which she couldn't even finish, it was too much!!  I think next time I'll try the pear and Gorgonzola... and then get another carnitas to go!!!     Hold the salsa this time. /Tasty!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-clinton-township-2?start=20
Kim B.,"Smiths Creek, MI",0,23,,1.0,4/10/2015,Had the Thia crunch salad with avocado 16.50. Way to high!!! Not worth it. You guys need to watch your prices... Won't be back!

Kent M.,"Macomb County, MI",253,1603,1135,4.0,11/11/2012,"Today is Veteran's Day and I visited for a complimentary meal. The offer is good for veterans today and tomorrow (12NOV2012). Attentive service, good food.  A bit pricey. They were busy this afternoon, but managed to keep everything moving rather well. I'm a meat -n- potatoes man in a designer pizza place.  I got the meat-lover's pizza.  They have all sorts of fancy-schmancy pizzas.  I will probably have to try another and another until my curiosity is satisfied, BUT, I'm still a fan of plain-jane cheese-n-pepperoni deep dish pizza. Distractive background music. Actually, since it was so loud, I guess you can't call it background music.  Also, the wrap-around booth seating was a little tight to maneuver.

Marcus S.,"Detroit, MI",114,20,8,1.0,8/7/2015,"I was not impressed. I've been here before and kept giving CPK a chance, but tonight's food and service was really lacking. We were seated outside immediately but the waitress took a while to get back to us no matter what the request was. Baked Mac n Cheese starter was bland and cold. My pizza with ham, mushrooms and sausage was sub par only because basil (leaves) made its way on the pie, not to mention it was doused with cilantro. The sausage was also made with way too much seasoning so I often crunched into spices. The experience was not enjoyable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-clinton-township-2?start=20
Terri S.,"Macomb, MI",0,14,,4.0,7/21/2015,"I really love the pizzas here because they are different from the traditional pizza. I love the club, tostada, Thai, Hawaiian and bbq pizzas. My husband prefers a traditional pizza so he normally orders salmon (which he claims is amazing) or the chicken Milanese. The desserts are pretty great too.

We arrived with no wait on a Friday night and it spiraled down from there. Our salad order was wrong, waiter apologized. Pizza came, you guessed it, wrong requests, waiter apologized. Meal took twice as long since we had to keep waiting for our orders to be remade. Finally the waiter went into the kitchen and remade our pizza himself. Never saw a manager, no apology, no kitchen management worth a lick......avoid this place and try something else in the area.

Bryden C.,"Harrison charter Township, MI",1,3,2,2.0,10/20/2015,"I visited this establishment yesterday with my girlfriend, at her request.  We came to Partridge Creek on a ""clothing mission"", and wanted to get something to eat in the vicinity.  Neither of us had ever been to a CPK.  My GF saw a picture of one of their salads and thought it looked rather delicious, so we decided to try them out.  The service was very good, and we ended our meal with a generous tip for the young lady who was our cheerful, smiling, attentive (5 star) waitress.  The food, however, didn't fare nearly as well as the service.  It was average, at best, and the prices were, in my opinion, substantially in excess in relation to the portions, taste, and overall appeal of the meals.  My GF's salad was not that attractively prepared, a bit makeshift-ish, unlike it's picture.  The specialty items that made it the salad that it was supposed to be (Sorry, I forget it's name) were rather sparingly included, and the lettuce was far too plentiful in comparison.  My Garlic Fettuccine, with Chicken was ok, average, not bad, though not great, considering the small portion and the substantial price.  I would expect a $16 specialty salad to be substantially more plentiful, tasteful and attractive than was produced, and a $15 pasta entree to be a bit more toward ""quite good"" than I experienced.  If you've ever left a restaurant feeling like your money was not that well spent, feeling a bit ""cheated"" perhaps, then you can know how I was feeling about this experience... Not that I mind spending $40 for a quick meal, but when I do, I expect to be ""tickled"" a little bit by the experience, and the food.  Apart from the pleasant service, and the sight of my lover across the table, there were no ""tickles"" here.   Restaurants get afforded few chances to make a memorable and positive first impression on a new customer.  Last night, CPK failed in their first attempt with us.  I don't think that I need, or want, to give them another try.  Perhaps you will fare more favorably if you visit CPK... and perhaps you won't.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-clinton-township-2?start=20

The grilled veggies salad is fantastic and I really like their clam linguine *** make sure you mix the two sauce options together* You can't really go wrong with anything you order here because they have a policy in place that they replace anything you don't like...it's their way of encouraging patrons to try something new each time they visit.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-clinton-township-2?start=40

Matt K.,"Grosse Pointe Farms, MI",89,125,218,4.0,6/8/2010,Exactly what every CPK needs to be like. The CPK at Somerset Collection is great but lacks outdoor seating because of its location. The CPK at Partridge Creek is great because they have outdoor seating. The inside is very big and spaced out and it is easy to seat groups together and move around the restaurant without having the squeeze past people or tables. Service lacks a bit here then at Somerset Collection but unless you are about to drop over from starvation the extra few minutes allow you to catch up with friends. You can smell the scent of good food from around the mall and on the Nordstrom side it is coming from CPK.

One other pet peeve of mine is that crazy booth in places that seat 6 people.  Who wants to scootch forever, and then not get up to use the restroom because at least 2 other people are going to have to move to let you out.  And where do you put your purses and coats?  Worst seating configuration ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-clinton-township-2?start=40

Servers were trying to wend their way through the throngs of people waiting to be seated - I was waiting for someone to either 1) cough on their food, or 2) knock it out of the server's hands.  I spent half my dinner with some young boy hanging over the back of my daughter's banquette and staring at me the entire time. (Not to mention that I literally tripped over his sister on the way to the table!) The restaurant was so loud that the waitress couldn't hear us order ""no onions"" on the pizza and brought the wrong one and then had to take it away and bring a new one.

Andrea K.,"Rochester, MI",42,10,1,2.0,3/18/2017,"So, I would like to start by saying I love CPK at Somerset, but this location is bad.  We had dinner tonight and the service was awful.  The hostess was nice enough, but tried to seat 5 people at a table only made for 4- that barely allowed space for a chair on the end.  She was kind enough when we asked for a different table, but as someone who worked 15 years in food service, no one should seat a party of 5 here.  It was truly a tight space.  So we go back to the bar to wait for a better table, we are in zero rush so this isn't a problem.   The bartender barely acknowledges us and says, I'll be with you when I finish cutting these strawberries.  Then slices strawberries slower than I've ever witnessed.  I mean, 5 strawberries took the guy 5 minutes.  Then he takes our drink order, 9oz wine for me, Moscow mule for my SIL.  Brings me a 6oz pour and disappears saying someone else is going to make her mule.   I ask another bartender to verify if I have a 6 or 9oz (it cost more for the 9) she agrees it's a 6 and kindly pours me an additional 3oz.  A few mins later the first guy returns (still no mule in sight) and we wait, eventually I ask about her mule... he agrees to make it... umm, yeah that's sort of your job?!  We are eventually seated and the slow service continues, food was great, no complaints with the food, we ordered 3 pizzas and a salad to share between 5, perfect portion, a little leftovers.  I have to ask twice for a refill and not once does he refill any drinks or waters without us requesting and two guests sit with empty water glasses.   We cash out, the server snags our receipt and disappears.  He probably went home, which is fine. But we end of chatting, and no one ever comes near us to clear the table, or offer us water or refills.  We would have likely each ordered another drink.   Instead we sat with dirty dinner for plates in front of us.   Being a big fan of CPK this was a disappointment.  I'll stick to Somerset.  Oh!  And the bathrooms, what a MESS.  A manager used it as the same time as me, walks out, doesn't wipe or pick up a thing, then walks out.  Seriously?!  Even I felt compelled to wipe the counter!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-clinton-township-2

The pizza here was fresh, hot and perfectly cooked. A frozen pizza is good enough to eat, but it's obviously not the same. We each ordered our own thin crust pizzas, which are cheaper and about 10 inches. However, you get six huge slices -- looks bigger than 10 inches, which was fine with me. I ordered the Jamaican Jerk Chicken, made with spicy sweet Caribbean sauce, authentic Jamaican spices, Nueske's applewood smoked bacon, red onions and bell peppers. She got the roasted artichoke and spinach, made with ovenroasted artichoke hearts, roasted garlic, sautéed spinach, Mozzarella and Parmesan. The food was really good. We also ordered a half Caesar salad, which was huge but really nothing to write home about. They also provide bread with olive oil to dip it in, and that was great. For drinks she got a gin and tonic, which was strong, and I got a frozen margarita -- very good and potent with tequila. Thumbs up. The service is good and the place is casual.

The fettuccine was super watery and the zucchini slices were huge (they're supposed to be pasta sized).

We actually wanted to go to PF Changs, but didn't feel like waiting an hour so we walked over here and they had us in a booth in minutes. It's a cool place; trendy but not snobby. Comfortable.  We settled right in after my daughter was asked if she wanted a kid's menu.  LOL she's 12 and the menu is for 10 and under. We considered this a total bonus and she played right along. We ordered one of the small plate apps of fried mac and cheese.  Diva Queen LOVED them!! I thought they were OK, good breading, but the ones in Mackinac are pretty hard to beat.  Also, they put some ""cheese"" sauce on the plate, but it was like Velveeta and just congealed there.  Needed some tomato or something.  They were a little gummy for me. She ordered the Hawaiian pizza and I ordered the Carnitas Habanero pizza.   Food came out pretty quick which was great !  My pizza was shredded pork, with cilantro, 2 cheeses, pesto, and red onion...with a habanero salsa on the side. The pizza alone is fucking STELLAR if you ask me!!! Awesome thin crust.  You could bite through that pork easier than pepperoni and it tasted delicious!! The salsa  is kinda way hella-fucking HOT.  And they give you way too much of it.   Not hot like the hot at Lenny's Sub (see review) but just ""Ow my fucking lips are burning, make it stop!!""   I think I actually tried ""tapping out"" by hitting the table a few times.  (well gee Reggie, it's Habanero for shit's sake!!) Duh!!!"" I know.  Shut up.  It was interesting, but to me, I think the pizza held it on it's own.  The gimmick of the hot salsa is great for thrill seekers though!  D Q loved the crust on hers, it was traditional crust. She said the pizza was good but was having a hard time with the toppings falling off. I asked her if she wanted to come back and she said definitely so I think we have  a winner!! With 2 Pepsis it came out to $30.00 and that was with her kids menu pizza, which she couldn't even finish, it was too much!!  I think next time I'll try the pear and Gorgonzola... and then get another carnitas to go!!!     Hold the salsa this time. /Tasty!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-clinton-township-2?start=20

Bryden C.,"Harrison charter Township, United States",1,3,2,2.0,20/10/2015,"I visited this establishment yesterday with my girlfriend, at her request.  We came to Partridge Creek on a ""clothing mission"", and wanted to get something to eat in the vicinity.  Neither of us had ever been to a CPK.  My GF saw a picture of one of their salads and thought it looked rather delicious, so we decided to try them out.  The service was very good, and we ended our meal with a generous tip for the young lady who was our cheerful, smiling, attentive (5 star) waitress.  The food, however, didn't fare nearly as well as the service.  It was average, at best, and the prices were, in my opinion, substantially in excess in relation to the portions, taste, and overall appeal of the meals.  My GF's salad was not that attractively prepared, a bit makeshift-ish, unlike it's picture.  The specialty items that made it the salad that it was supposed to be (Sorry, I forget it's name) were rather sparingly included, and the lettuce was far too plentiful in comparison.  My Garlic Fettuccine, with Chicken was ok, average, not bad, though not great, considering the small portion and the substantial price.  I would expect a $16 specialty salad to be substantially more plentiful, tasteful and attractive than was produced, and a $15 pasta entree to be a bit more toward ""quite good"" than I experienced.  If you've ever left a restaurant feeling like your money was not that well spent, feeling a bit ""cheated"" perhaps, then you can know how I was feeling about this experience... Not that I mind spending $40 for a quick meal, but when I do, I expect to be ""tickled"" a little bit by the experience, and the food.  Apart from the pleasant service, and the sight of my lover across the table, there were no ""tickles"" here.   Restaurants get afforded few chances to make a memorable and positive first impression on a new customer.  Last night, CPK failed in their first attempt with us.  I don't think that I need, or want, to give them another try.  Perhaps you will fare more favorably if you visit CPK... and perhaps you won't.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-clinton-township-2?start=20

The CPK at Somerset Collection is great but lacks outdoor seating because of its location. The CPK at Partridge Creek is great because they have outdoor seating. The inside is very big and spaced out and it is easy to seat groups together and move around the restaurant without having the squeeze past people or tables. Service lacks a bit here then at Somerset Collection but unless you are about to drop over from starvation the extra few minutes allow you to catch up with friends.

One other pet peeve of mine is that crazy booth in places that seat 6 people.  Who wants to scootch forever, and then not get up to use the restroom because at least 2 other people are going to have to move to let you out.  And where do you put your purses and coats?  Worst seating configuration ever.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-clinton-township-2?start=40
