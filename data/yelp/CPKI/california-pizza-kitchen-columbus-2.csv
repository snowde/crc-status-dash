Aaron H.,"Columbus, OH",47,63,53,4.0,12/23/2015,"CPK is one of my go-to restaurant if I want a semi-fancy dinner. The food is always great and consistent, but it can get too pricey. The service is generally good and I never had to wait for a table here. Overall it's a great place, but let's get into some details. If you love mushrooms, even if you don't, you must try Wild Mushroom Pizza!! My family and I went here for my birthday dinner and we ordered the pizza as an appetizer and my oh my, was it good! Even my brother, who tries anything and everything to avoid mushrooms, tried it and said it was delish! I tried the Moroccan Spiced Chicken Salad and this was the best salad I ever had! It had so many ingredients including dates, butternut squash, almonds, avocado, cranberries, beets, and more! It appeared and tasted very healthy. It comes in two sizes, half and full. I ordered the full, and that was a mistake. I ended up eating only half and taking half for my lunch the next day. So even if you're hungry, you'll probably end up taking some of it home. It's a huge one! The service was excellent. He seemed very professional and extremely polite. He looked presentable and took good care of us. I know it could be biased because it was my birthday dinner, but I absolutely loved it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2
Mark K.,"Columbus, OH",184,1936,1243,2.0,10/23/2016,"We come here once in awhile because the food is good, but generally avoid it due to iffy service.  Today it was handy, and we had yet another sketchy experience. With a new baby, priorities change, and that includes eating options.  Burgers or anything you need two hands for are right out.  And how a restaurant handles the baby becomes important.  Most places are very accommodating, and even anticipate our needs (of course, they've had to deal with kids before, and we are still learning...) CPK is not baby-friendly.  We found that out the hard way.  When we walked up, the hostesses did not seem to have their act together, and let a large group block the entryway while they waited for a table to be cleared.  Okay, fine, we'll be patient.  Once we got our name in we were seated almost immediately. However, we couldn't take the stroller back with us.  If you have kids, you know a stroller is almost permanently attached to your arm.  A seat for the baby.  A bed.  Space to stow gear.  You need it.  I asked why we had to leave it:  ""fire regulations.""  Really?  No other restaurant has mentioned that.  Plus, the strollers left by the front door actually block everyone's way and create a hazard.  We almost left then.  But, fine, we're hungry.  We were seated in the back, where there was plenty of room for a stroller to sit without blocking anything.  Oh, and there are no high chairs.  Look, this is a place directly across from the Lego store.  Plus it's Easton.  And they have ""chairs"" for American Girl dolls ($130, good god, why did we have a daughter?)  But no strollers or high chairs.  Hm. After we were seated, our service was great.  The server checked up on us and kept us supplied with drinks, napkins, etc.  And the food was good.  I had the corn guacamole as an app- kernels of corn, a little heat, fresh avocado.  Sweetie had a pepperoni pie, and I had the carne asada.  Again, a little heat.  Tender steak, fresh toppings, good crust. We left happy enough (and glad our stroller was still there, because they are expensive and we had zero faith in the hostesses keeping an eye on it.)  CPK seems to keep trying to drive us away.  It is usually last on our list when we eat at Easton, because of the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2
Arvid Y.,"Rochester, NY",278,446,629,3.0,5/24/2016,"Surprisingly, it was my first time dining at CPK last weekend. I've bought their frozen pizzas from the grocery store, but never dined in a brick and mortar restaurant. I'm a big fan of BBQ Chicken Pizza, so my eyes automatically gravitated to that item on their menu. Marketing works and their menu's claim of creating ""the original"" BBQ Chicken in 1985 intrigued me. It also elevated my expectations. Unfortunately, reality set shortly after the pizza was delivered. It was underwhelming. The crust itself was nice and thin, but I found to be extremely dry and a bit starchy. The toppings were also a bit scarce. I thought the pizza could have used more BBQ sauce and also chicken. The size of the pizza was also disappointing. For $15, you get 6 thin slices. Not a terrible deal, but it's definitely more of a personal sized pizza than something you can share between two people.  I don't think i'll be back to CPK for their pizza. There are many better chain (and non-chain) restaurants that serve a better pie for less. With that said, the service was great and it's not a bad option for bigger groups.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2
Darlene C.,"Columbus, OH",2,61,142,2.0,7/4/2016,"Upon entering, the hostess refused to greet us even after I decided to say hello and ask how she was doing. She then let us know how stressed she was, seated us and walked away with obviously something other than us on her mind. The atmosphere appears to be that everyone is super busy, but the restaurant is half empty. Furthermore, it is impossible to tell who the  manager is. I'm just really glad the hostess had her problem before I came around. We ordered the BBQ salad, which was descent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2
Adam M.,"Fort Wayne, IN",16,33,19,2.0,12/10/2016,"I'm giving it a two instead of bashing this place due to only the food was okay, but the wait staff were completely horrible. They need new management or something",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2
Sandra F.,"Cincinnati, OH",366,1347,4660,4.0,3/9/2015,"I would like to update my review.  A couple of years ago my sister in law and I was craving CPK.  This was the closet one to the downtown area.  We attended a concert at the Nationwide Arena.  We really liked the food, service and area.  Definately bookmarked this location for the next time I return.   Last weekend, my friend and I went to the Arnold Fitness Expo.  And again, I was craving CPK.  I wish that they would open one up in Cincinnati.   After the a long day at the Expo, we finally got to sit down and relax.  We dined in around 3:00 p.m. and it was packed.  We only had to wait 10 minutes which wasn't bad.  The hostess was very helpful and friendly.  The server was also friendly.  He got our drink orders right away.   I wanted to get the Carmelized Peach Salad, but there were out of peaches.  I was bummed, but instead ordered the Waldorf Chicken Salad (Full size $13.99) , sub Salmon instead of the chicken.  My friend ordered the same and we split a small Bbq Chicken Pizza and added bacon for $1.75 more.   Our Pizza came out first, which I found very odd, but it made sense since the salmon had to cook alittle longer.  The manager and also the server came out and apologized for the wait ( I like the heads up and communication, very nice).  We were chatting and was having great conversation, so it wasn't a big deal.   Our salad came out after 20 minutes.  We were done with our pizza, so it was good timing.   Everything was perfect.  The salad was fresh (the dressing was not drenched or overwhelming), good amount of salmon on the salad, and as described on the menu.  Pizza was delicious as always (ordered thin crust).  I never tried the bacon on the pizza, so this was a bonus (compliments well).   Overall, it was a a comfortable and relaxing dine in.  And the food was great!   Highly recommend this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2
Tammy A.,"Columbus, OH",248,542,590,4.0,3/7/2015,"I came here with a friend today for lunch. We both enjoyed the chips and guac appetizer. Did you know if you download the CPK pizza dough app on your phone and sign up for their rewards club you get a free appetizer? So we both got that chips and guac for free! Besides the appetizer we both enjoyed our salads as well. Mine was the quinoa salad on the lighter fare side of the menu. Though it was not entirely filling, it did the job for a couple of hours. Although I can thank the chips and guac for that too and I would have not got that without our awesome waiter! We were his first customers and he showed us quality service.:) I sort of laughed when the restaurant brought out more of our salads after we had already gotten our salads, it was just a simple mistake though. They were unsure that we had them I guess. I think the next time I come back I will get the pizza since like any other person it's my favorite food. I would share that pizza with my husband and knowing him he would probably just order a veggie pizza for both of us. I will definitely be back because I love pizza and good quality service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2
Hannah C.,"Northwest, Columbus, OH",21,63,134,4.0,4/25/2016,"Have eaten here a handful of times. While it's not my go-to place, my boyfriend's family loves it so we end up here every so often. I think I keep ordering the same dish (it sounds so good) and then am slightly disappointed. The last couple times I've gotten the pesto chicken pasta dish (don't remember the actual name). It's good but could use more...pizzazz. The portion, while it is enough to fill me up, is still smaller than I would expect. You can choose to add chicken or shrip to this but you really don't get much meat. It also has sun dried tomatoes in it, but again, so few that it's just disappointing. It could really be great if they'd kick up the flavor a notch. Note to self- get pizza next time or try something else.  The mango lemonade is awesome. Avocado rolls are also pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2

Steven R.,"New Albany, OH",1,10,2,3.0,7/15/2016,"Came in with no one at the hostess station, so it took a minute for them to finally notice us and seat us.  Didn't take our drink order when we sat down.  :(    Got some nice bread and some oil with herbs.  It was ok, herbs weren't very prevalent.   Ordered the BBQ chicken salad.   It was nothing too special, it wasn't any better than olive garden pizza in my opinion.  Next time I'll have to try the pizza.  Seems these guys need to step up their salad and service game a bit.   3/5",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2
Van S.,"Orient, OH",88,267,149,3.0,10/28/2014,"I've never been a huge fan of CPK's pizza.  I never thought it was bad, just have preferred other options around Easton.  So when I had to attend a family dinner here, I went in with tempered expectations.   We had a reservation for our party of 10, and we were promptly seated.  Our server took a little long to greet us and put in our drink order, but ongoing service was good.  The kitchen did run quite slow. Since I wasn't in the mood for pizza I opted for the fish tacos.  I was presented with two tacos that each contained one or two small panko crusted mahi mahi filets, a creamy cabbage slaw, and avocado slices.  I think with the avocado (+$1) the meal entree was around $13.  The fish was fried perfectly crispy, and the slaw was rich and creamy enough while still maintaining a little crunch.  I really enjoyed the tacos.  Accompanying them were slightly stale nachos and a good fresh salsa.  Taste-wise I was satisfied, but I was still hungry afterwards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2
Sarah P.,"Columbus, OH",62,313,11,5.0,9/18/2014,"My daughter and I were enjoying a wonderful day of shopping at Easton when we came across this California Pizza location.  We were both hungry so we decided to go on it. I ordered the Waldorf salad, which was wonderful.  The candied pecans are so good I wanted to ask for a side of those alone. My daughter ordered the cheese pizza which she was quite happy with (she ate the whole thing). My daughter, after she was done scarfing down her pizza, looked at me and pointed to an advertisement sitting on our table for Salted Carmel Pudding draped over a chocolate cookie crumble with homemade whipped topping that had sea salt sprinkled on it.  I said, ""You want that baby?"" and she immediately said YES!  So of course we ordered it.  It came, it looked just like the picture, and it was SCRUMPTIOUS!  It is one of the best desserts I have had.

Kristen J.,"Columbus, OH",24,11,,4.0,8/25/2015,"I figured for the billion times that I've been here, I should at least finally write a review.  This is my boyfriend and I's main date spot, first of all...even if I suggest we try something different, we almost always end up here instead. Our usual order consists of the following: - Avocado Egg Rolls - Jamaican Jerk Pizza  - Butter Cake The avocado egg rolls is THE perfect starter course and it comes with regular ranch and like a southwestern ranch sauce to dip in. We usually down these babies within 5 minutes. Occasionally we might also order the Mac & Cheese bites if we're really hungry.  Then we're followed by our favorite pizza on the menu: the Jamaican Jerk. It's the perfect balance of sweet and spicy flavors. My boyfriend always likes to dip his pizza in the southwestern ranch sauce too. We've tried other pizzas like the Pear & Gorgonzola and Chipotle Chicken, which are all great pizzas on their own. I will say we've never tried anything else on the menu as far as entree's go. We're just a couple of pizza-loving kids.  Lastly, if we've managed to not eat ourselves into complete oblivion, we ALWAYS get the Butter Cake if we get dessert. No ifs, ands, or buts. This dessert alone is enough reason to eat here if you haven't already. I'm not even exaggerating how awesome this cake is!   I've tried other various things on the menu and haven't experienced any disappointment with anything I've ordered. Definitely give this place a try if you're looking for a casual night out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2
Shea H.,"Vernon, CT",93,252,972,1.0,1/18/2014,"I usually love California Pizza Kitchen.  A chain that caters to vegans is a rarity so I tend to love CPK for that reason alone.  But this location is horrible.  Just horrible. Arrived to a mostly empty restaurant on a late Thursday afternoon. Sat at the bar and immediately asked for the vegan menu.  It's not so much a menu but a guide-- but I've seen it a million times.  Of course, I'm told that they don't have one.  I avoid being rude and tried to politely push-- 'oh no, you guys previously had one-- did you get rid of it'.  Thankfully, she decides to inquire with someone else but apparently that person didn't know anything either. I gave up and said that I'll just check the CPK website on my phone.  Not long after, another person finds the menu and brings it to me.  I was grateful but it is annoying to have to deal with that kind of thing. I shouldn't have to hope that my server is knowledgeable. That should be the default. Anywho, after this- she was fine.  Sure, it took her nearly 10 minutes to bring my marinara sauce because she forgot... but at least she was nice. The food was pretty bad.  Burnt and cold flatbread.  Flavorless salad.  The guacamole was good, though. If you're a fan of CPK, I would recommend the Polaris location.  The food and the service were subpar at the Easton location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2
Irene B.,"New York, NY",362,23,84,2.0,9/7/2015,"I haven't been here in forever and decided to give it another shot. The long line outside the door is a bit deceiving. It's an easy place to dine with a pretty good array of choices. But if pizza is in your name, you probably should know how to make a decent pizza. I usually don't meet a pizza I don't like... and honestly here it's worse than chains like Pizza Hut and dominos. Tasteless crust and toppings are sparse.

Diana P.,"Columbus, OH",29,17,6,3.0,5/8/2014,"This is another place that I've visited in a very long time.  I usually get the jamaican jerk chicken pizza but this time, I ordered a jambalaya fettuccine and pear & gorgonzola pizza for my parents and I to share.  I'm not a big fan of fettuccine in general and the dish was a tiny bit too salty for my taste but my parents liked it.  The dish consists of a lot of sausages, shrimp, lobster tail, even some scallops.  Pear & Gorgonzola pizza was pretty good--the nuts sprinkled on top added a nice crunch to each bite. Food was pretty good but I agree with another's review that I probably won't drive all the way down just to eat here but it is a good place to stop & fill my stomach when shopping at Easton.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2
Ron C.,"Mason, OH",0,41,,2.0,10/13/2014,"Four adults for dinner on a Friday. Three pizzas and a pasta dish. Service was slow, but it was busy. Pizza was average, which is disappointing for the price. The pasta dish could have been made by anyone willing to throw some chicken and sausage into a pan with some standard pasta sauce and heat. Eating out, the dishes should be at least as good as you can throw together quickly at home. This was not the case. Twice I clarified if it was still happy hour pricing for drinks. Twice it was acknowledged. Still had to correct the bill for this.

Courtney W.,"Daytona Beach, FL",50,337,195,1.0,4/17/2014,"Tom and I stopped in here one night after a long walk around Easton. We were hungry and decided this was as good as any. Wrong-o! So I love pizza, I crave pizza, and I'm from a place that doesn't hold back when it comes to our pies. I won't name names of course.  First off, the host sat us right next to a booth full of screaming girls. No joke & no exaggeration here. Where a booth can usually hold 4-6 people, there were 8 plus one sitting on a chair at the end. But the issue here is how loud they were. We're talking 9 drunk chicks who have no idea what a decibel is. You get the point. The place was empty, with only maybe 1 booth on the other side of the resturant taken....and we're seated next to these cackling chickens. Dinner didn't start off too great.  We ordered a pizza. It was $13 so we figured it would be big enough for the both of us. We ask the waiter his opinion and he agreed, making some hand gesture to show a 12'' pizza, possibly larger. we get the wild mushroom pizza. I love wild mushroom pizza! It's my go-to lately and frankly, I'm not thinking of changing that any time soon.  Longest wait of my life. No lie. These girls gave me a migraine just in time for them to leave and 10 mins later our food came. About 25mins total which is insane for something as small as what he handed us.  It was a 8'' pizza, mostly crust & mushrooms, no sauce (white pizza has sauce of a sort but this had nothing), and no flavor. The mushrooms were way over cooked to the point where I could taste the dirt and that was it. The crust was bland, not chewy at all, and super thin... but not the good kind of thin. This was horrible. We didn't see our waiter again all night so we just ate it and when we saw him again we ask about the size and he goes '' Well they're usually a little bigger, more like *he gestures a 10'' pizza*'' which to anyone I know is a personal sized pizza unless you have a salad with it or something. My husband is a big man, 6' and at...there's no way two of those frisbee sized pizza would have filled him let alone half of one.  I feel jipped.  Not only did this guy lie to us but it tasted horrible! We wouldnt have order anything if I knew it was 8'' or even 10'' for $13 The only thing going for it were just how many mushrooms they crammed onto the pizza. They did that right at least.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2?start=20

We picked a one popular restaurant that is California Pizza Kitchen, because there are lots of people were waiting  a line in front of the door to enjoy dinner.  We ordered the Original BBQ Chicken Pizza, Sedona Tortilla soup, Dakota Smashed Pea+Barley soup and Lettuce wraps. To be honest, the BBQ flavor was always my favorite but this BBQ pizza had another memorable taste. When you ate it, I felt some sweet, spicy and the fresh smell from onion. The onion brought sweet tastes with BBQ source and this feeling made pizza tastier. My friends ordered two different types of soup. Both of them were flavorful. One of it was sweet and the other was tart due to some tomatoes. The only hot dish that we got was Lettuce Wrap and I had to say I never ate so appetizing food like this before. The chicken and shrimp was stirred fry and separated with fresh lettuce. The tastes made me feel coming back to hometown. The cool lettuce with hot chicken and shrimp gave the mouthes two different feelings and you can stop eating them!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2?start=20

The thin crust is brushed with olive oil, so it makes it incredibly light and so yummy.  You can also buy their pizzas in the frozen food grocery aisle. I actually went to the restaurant in Easton last night for dinner, and I was amazed at how big their menu was! I chose the broccoli sundried tomato Fussili pasta, which was so incredibly delicious.  Our server, Nicole, was very attentive to our needs and was knowledgeable of the menu.

The pizza is in thin size and taste like a ' baked' biscuit, with the cheese seafood on it. On the top of the cheese is a kind of cold veggies salad with a kind of 'magic' sauce, taste like vinegar. I liked it very much! It is very delicious and felt almost like eating a kind of ' desert'.  I also ordered the sandwich there and it also tastes good.

Mark K.,"Columbus, United States",184,1936,1243,2.0,23/10/2016,"We come here once in awhile because the food is good, but generally avoid it due to iffy service.  Today it was handy, and we had yet another sketchy experience. With a new baby, priorities change, and that includes eating options.  Burgers or anything you need two hands for are right out.  And how a restaurant handles the baby becomes important.  Most places are very accommodating, and even anticipate our needs (of course, they've had to deal with kids before, and we are still learning...) CPK is not baby-friendly.  We found that out the hard way.  When we walked up, the hostesses did not seem to have their act together, and let a large group block the entryway while they waited for a table to be cleared.  Okay, fine, we'll be patient.  Once we got our name in we were seated almost immediately. However, we couldn't take the stroller back with us.  If you have kids, you know a stroller is almost permanently attached to your arm.  A seat for the baby.  A bed.  Space to stow gear.  You need it.  I asked why we had to leave it:  ""fire regulations.""  Really?  No other restaurant has mentioned that.  Plus, the strollers left by the front door actually block everyone's way and create a hazard.  We almost left then.  But, fine, we're hungry.  We were seated in the back, where there was plenty of room for a stroller to sit without blocking anything.  Oh, and there are no high chairs.  Look, this is a place directly across from the Lego store.  Plus it's Easton.  And they have ""chairs"" for American Girl dolls ($130, good god, why did we have a daughter?)  But no strollers or high chairs.  Hm. After we were seated, our service was great.  The server checked up on us and kept us supplied with drinks, napkins, etc.  And the food was good.  I had the corn guacamole as an app- kernels of corn, a little heat, fresh avocado.  Sweetie had a pepperoni pie, and I had the carne asada.  Again, a little heat.  Tender steak, fresh toppings, good crust. We left happy enough (and glad our stroller was still there, because they are expensive and we had zero faith in the hostesses keeping an eye on it.)  CPK seems to keep trying to drive us away.  It is usually last on our list when we eat at Easton, because of the service.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2
Arvid Y.,"Rochester, United States",278,446,629,3.0,24/5/2016,"Surprisingly, it was my first time dining at CPK last weekend. I've bought their frozen pizzas from the grocery store, but never dined in a brick and mortar restaurant. I'm a big fan of BBQ Chicken Pizza, so my eyes automatically gravitated to that item on their menu. Marketing works and their menu's claim of creating ""the original"" BBQ Chicken in 1985 intrigued me. It also elevated my expectations. Unfortunately, reality set shortly after the pizza was delivered. It was underwhelming. The crust itself was nice and thin, but I found to be extremely dry and a bit starchy. The toppings were also a bit scarce. I thought the pizza could have used more BBQ sauce and also chicken. The size of the pizza was also disappointing. For $15, you get 6 thin slices. Not a terrible deal, but it's definitely more of a personal sized pizza than something you can share between two people.  I don't think i'll be back to CPK for their pizza.

Sandra F.,"Cincinnati, United States",366,1347,4660,4.0,9/3/2015,"I would like to update my review.  A couple of years ago my sister in law and I was craving CPK.  This was the closet one to the downtown area.  We attended a concert at the Nationwide Arena.  We really liked the food, service and area.  Definately bookmarked this location for the next time I return.   Last weekend, my friend and I went to the Arnold Fitness Expo.  And again, I was craving CPK.  I wish that they would open one up in Cincinnati.   After the a long day at the Expo, we finally got to sit down and relax.  We dined in around 3:00 p.m. and it was packed.  We only had to wait 10 minutes which wasn't bad.  The hostess was very helpful and friendly.  The server was also friendly.  He got our drink orders right away.   I wanted to get the Carmelized Peach Salad, but there were out of peaches.  I was bummed, but instead ordered the Waldorf Chicken Salad (Full size $13.99) , sub Salmon instead of the chicken.  My friend ordered the same and we split a small Bbq Chicken Pizza and added bacon for $1.75 more.   Our Pizza came out first, which I found very odd, but it made sense since the salmon had to cook alittle longer.  The manager and also the server came out and apologized for the wait ( I like the heads up and communication, very nice).  We were chatting and was having great conversation, so it wasn't a big deal.   Our salad came out after 20 minutes.  We were done with our pizza, so it was good timing.   Everything was perfect.  The salad was fresh (the dressing was not drenched or overwhelming), good amount of salmon on the salad, and as described on the menu.  Pizza was delicious as always (ordered thin crust).  I never tried the bacon on the pizza, so this was a bonus (compliments well).   Overall, it was a a comfortable and relaxing dine in.  And the food was great!   Highly recommend this place.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2
Tammy A.,"Columbus, United States",248,542,590,4.0,7/3/2015,"I came here with a friend today for lunch. We both enjoyed the chips and guac appetizer. Did you know if you download the CPK pizza dough app on your phone and sign up for their rewards club you get a free appetizer? So we both got that chips and guac for free! Besides the appetizer we both enjoyed our salads as well. Mine was the quinoa salad on the lighter fare side of the menu. Though it was not entirely filling, it did the job for a couple of hours. Although I can thank the chips and guac for that too and I would have not got that without our awesome waiter! We were his first customers and he showed us quality service.:) I sort of laughed when the restaurant brought out more of our salads after we had already gotten our salads, it was just a simple mistake though. They were unsure that we had them I guess. I think the next time I come back I will get the pizza since like any other person it's my favorite food. I would share that pizza with my husband and knowing him he would probably just order a veggie pizza for both of us. I will definitely be back because I love pizza and good quality service!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2

The last couple times I've gotten the pesto chicken pasta dish (don't remember the actual name). It's good but could use more...pizzazz. The portion, while it is enough to fill me up, is still smaller than I would expect. You can choose to add chicken or shrip to this but you really don't get much meat. It also has sun dried tomatoes in it, but again, so few that it's just disappointing. It could really be great if they'd kick up the flavor a notch.

Since I wasn't in the mood for pizza I opted for the fish tacos.  I was presented with two tacos that each contained one or two small panko crusted mahi mahi filets, a creamy cabbage slaw, and avocado slices.  I think with the avocado (+$1) the meal entree was around $13.  The fish was fried perfectly crispy, and the slaw was rich and creamy enough while still maintaining a little crunch.  I really enjoyed the tacos.  Accompanying them were slightly stale nachos and a good fresh salsa.  Taste-wise I was satisfied, but I was still hungry afterwards.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2

This is my boyfriend and I's main date spot, first of all...even if I suggest we try something different, we almost always end up here instead. Our usual order consists of the following: - Avocado Egg Rolls - Jamaican Jerk Pizza  - Butter Cake The avocado egg rolls is THE perfect starter course and it comes with regular ranch and like a southwestern ranch sauce to dip in. We usually down these babies within 5 minutes. Occasionally we might also order the Mac & Cheese bites if we're really hungry.  Then we're followed by our favorite pizza on the menu: the Jamaican Jerk. It's the perfect balance of sweet and spicy flavors. My boyfriend always likes to dip his pizza in the southwestern ranch sauce too. We've tried other pizzas like the Pear & Gorgonzola and Chipotle Chicken, which are all great pizzas on their own. I will say we've never tried anything else on the menu as far as entree's go. We're just a couple of pizza-loving kids.  Lastly, if we've managed to not eat ourselves into complete oblivion, we ALWAYS get the Butter Cake if we get dessert. No ifs, ands, or buts. This dessert alone is enough reason to eat here if you haven't already.

But this location is horrible.  Just horrible. Arrived to a mostly empty restaurant on a late Thursday afternoon. Sat at the bar and immediately asked for the vegan menu.  It's not so much a menu but a guide-- but I've seen it a million times.  Of course, I'm told that they don't have one.  I avoid being rude and tried to politely push-- 'oh no, you guys previously had one-- did you get rid of it'.  Thankfully, she decides to inquire with someone else but apparently that person didn't know anything either. I gave up and said that I'll just check the CPK website on my phone.  Not long after, another person finds the menu and brings it to me.  I was grateful but it is annoying to have to deal with that kind of thing. I shouldn't have to hope that my server is knowledgeable. That should be the default. Anywho, after this- she was fine.  Sure, it took her nearly 10 minutes to bring my marinara sauce because she forgot... but at least she was nice. The food was pretty bad.  Burnt and cold flatbread.  Flavorless salad.  The guacamole was good, though.

So I love pizza, I crave pizza, and I'm from a place that doesn't hold back when it comes to our pies. I won't name names of course.  First off, the host sat us right next to a booth full of screaming girls. No joke & no exaggeration here. Where a booth can usually hold 4-6 people, there were 8 plus one sitting on a chair at the end. But the issue here is how loud they were. We're talking 9 drunk chicks who have no idea what a decibel is. You get the point. The place was empty, with only maybe 1 booth on the other side of the resturant taken....and we're seated next to these cackling chickens. Dinner didn't start off too great.  We ordered a pizza. It was $13 so we figured it would be big enough for the both of us. We ask the waiter his opinion and he agreed, making some hand gesture to show a 12'' pizza, possibly larger. we get the wild mushroom pizza. I love wild mushroom pizza! It's my go-to lately and frankly, I'm not thinking of changing that any time soon.  Longest wait of my life. No lie. These girls gave me a migraine just in time for them to leave and 10 mins later our food came. About 25mins total which is insane for something as small as what he handed us.  It was a 8'' pizza, mostly crust & mushrooms, no sauce (white pizza has sauce of a sort but this had nothing), and no flavor. The mushrooms were way over cooked to the point where I could taste the dirt and that was it. The crust was bland, not chewy at all, and super thin... but not the good kind of thin. This was horrible. We didn't see our waiter again all night so we just ate it and when we saw him again we ask about the size and he goes '' Well they're usually a little bigger, more like *he gestures a 10'' pizza*'' which to anyone I know is a personal sized pizza unless you have a salad with it or something. My husband is a big man, 6' and at...there's no way two of those frisbee sized pizza would have filled him let alone half of one.  I feel jipped.  Not only did this guy lie to us but it tasted horrible! We wouldnt have order anything if I knew it was 8'' or even 10'' for $13 The only thing going for it were just how many mushrooms they crammed onto the pizza.

The onion brought sweet tastes with BBQ source and this feeling made pizza tastier. My friends ordered two different types of soup. Both of them were flavorful. One of it was sweet and the other was tart due to some tomatoes. The only hot dish that we got was Lettuce Wrap and I had to say I never ate so appetizing food like this before.

Mike B.,"Columbus, United States",181,1013,8,2.0,18/7/2011,"Server was nice, but brought us the wrong pizza that was supposed to go to another table. We lifted up some cheese to see if there were mushrooms there, but it was definitely a mexican pizza. After telling the server we ""poked it"" she took it back inside, but within a minute brought out (what we think was) the same pizza to a table two spots down. suspicious.... Also, asked for a refill when our pizza got there, and got the refill about 3 minutes after we had finished our food. Excuse was that only the bar has cranberry juice, but whatever, I don't buy it. Not the best place to eat at Easton, and I doubt I'll be headed back.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2?start=40

Roy H.,"Columbus, United States",149,254,292,1.0,3/1/2009,"Sorry so-called ""pizza lovers"" - this is not real pizza. Since when does anybody in California know how to make pizza??? I grew up outside of Philly and lived near NYC for years. I've also lived in LA. I can honestly tell you that I couldn't find any real pizza in Cali, nor will you find it here in Columbus (except for a few ""close-calls"" here and there).  Welcome to my nightmare, Columbus. Some pizza places are better than others, but California Pizza Kitchen has always fallen short of the mark. Yes, they have good food and other meal items to choose from, but this is not real pizza. I'm sorry. That's just how it is. I'm spoiled, because I know better. So sue me!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2?start=40
TJ R.,"Lewis Center, United States",21,68,,4.0,16/4/2011,Good variety and good quality. Prices can feel a bit steep since it's hard to resist each person ordering their own pizza. My favorite pizza is their Margherita which is pleasantly simple and tasty. Salads and pasta dishes are also good if nothing on the pizza side sounds appealing.

The pizza isn't my style, so that might be part of my problem, but I've had pizza in California and it didn't fall nearly as flat as CPK does every single time.  The toppings don't seem fresh to me, the crust is spongey and the flavors are all a little off.   The staff has always been nice though and they keep the place clean so at least they have that going for them.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2?start=40

CPK is a refreshing alternative to the heaviness of real pizza.  It's lighter, dough is a bit sweeter and the toppings (for the most part) can be healthier. If I'm in the mood for ""real"" pizza I'll go to Chicago or NY, but for my local fix of something yummy with healthy toppings I'll visit my local CPK.

I'm not sure why their pizza is so famous because it kind of sucks. HAHA. But, seriously, I think I just needed to find that out so I'd explore the rest of the menu. And then....there it was!!! Three words, Morracoan Chicken Salad. Super YUM!! This is the most inventive and amazing salad ever. Who knew butternut squash, beets, eggs, carrots, marcona almonds, and champagne vinegarette could be married into salad heaven!?!?  I totally crave it all the time and now I ask to go there. Side note, the small plates tamale ravioli will blow your socks off too. Another super yum invention by the CPK food scientists.  The service is always just fine. Their prices are on the high side. Almost $13 for the salad, but it's huge and will stuff you if you eat it all, whcih I can't help but do. Two people won't get out of there for less than $40 after tip if eating dinner. I've never had to wait there, but have never been during peak hours and am not sure I'd wait an hour to eat there. I don't really dig the layout of the seating, but I deal with it.

I was visiting lots of people that weekend, so I needed to keep my food consumption down, so I just had a bowl of the Sedona Tortilla soup.  It was large enough that I probably should have just gotten a cup.  It was as good as normal.  Served piping hot, I was a happy girl.  I do wish they served it with some flat bread, but I'm sure you could order it on the side.  I always just forget until the bowl shows up.  One friend had eggrolls and the other had an Italian pizza, and both said they were enjoyable. Our server was friendly & prompted. It's CPK...the food is decent & the service is pretty consistent.  Yes, Roy, it's not what I'd call ""pizza"" as well, but they make some interesting combination.  I've come to love their soups and other non-pizza dishes.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2?start=60

Emily H.,"Chicago, United States",38,192,12,4.0,26/7/2007,"Yes, it's a chain and yes, I try to patronize locally-owned restaurants more often than not, but sometimes CPK just hits the spot.  It is frequented by parents and small children, and on a Saturday afternoon strollers will fill the hallway outside the entrance and there will be a wait.  However, the service has always been good and the food is interesting.   CPK's pizzas run the gamut from basics such as traditional cheese and pepperoni to more exotic offerings like the cajun or the Thai chicken.  My personal favorite is the tostada, with black beans, cheddar, tomatoes, lettuce, tortilla strips, and a hint of ranch dressing.  I inevitably have to take half of it home and it is even better the next day when the flavors have a chance to seep into the crust and it is cold.  For anyone in your party who does not enjoy pizza or isn't in the mood, there are pastas and some chicken dishes.  The appetizers aren't those of your typical pizza-joint - egg rolls, hummus, and lettuce wraps.  There is also a full bar for those of us without children and an assortment of tempting desserts. If you're in the mood to try a new twist on a classic American dish, give CPK a try.  The Polaris location is equally good and both get a thumbs up for taking something that seems simple and expanding it in so many ways.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2?start=60

We finally tried it today. It was good, but not great. The service was excellent, and the waitress was very friendly and knew everything about the menu. One thing you should know beforehand, the pizza's aren't very big. They're only big enough for about two people, so if there are more people with you then you should order a second. We got both the works and the sicilian pizza's. They both tasted good, but could have been better. I personally like a saucy pizza, and on both of them there was only a thin layer of sauce and it was a bit too dry. It's also not very filling if you have to share with others. I would probably go back again one day, but I would probably just try one of their pasta dishes instead. It's a nice place to go to, but I've tasted better.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-2?start=60
