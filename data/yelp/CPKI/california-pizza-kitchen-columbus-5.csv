Brad W.,"Westerville, OH",44,92,5,3.0,1/28/2012,"I came to California Pizza Kitchen for lunch today. I had been here before, but I'm not a huge fan. The waiter was pretty helpful and I decided to try something new. I had the Hawaiian Pizza, with pineapple and pepperoni which tasted great. I had a cherry limeade to drink, which I had never tried either. I did start kinda on the wrong foot, though, by ordering a Caesar salad as an app. That wasn't too good. The lettuce was kinda old and it just didn't taste right to me. The pizza was much better, though, and really hit the spot. CPK is kinda pricey, too. Especially for a chain restaurant. And the line at this location is usually pretty long. Maybe that's why when I'm at Polaris, I either eat in the food court or at one of the outside restaurants like The Pub.  We did have good service, which is definitely a plus for any restaurant and she stopped to refill the drinks several times. The restaurant was busy too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5?start=40
Scott F.,"Erie, PA",22,229,85,4.0,12/3/2012,"Catching up on a few reviews. We eat here occasionally when we are visiting or passing through Columbus.

Kwankit C.,"Columbus, OH",0,1,,3.0,11/16/2014,"I really like the pasta here especially for kungpao pasta with shrimp.  It is really memorable! ALso for the pizza, i tasted the Italian spicy sausage pizza, it was really crisp and the sausage was quite delicious! I ate slides of pizza and one served pasta. I was really full and really appreciated the nice food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5?start=40
Heather A.,"Columbus, OH",64,340,138,4.0,8/3/2008,"I have never had a bad experience at this location in terms of service or food!  I appreciate their attempt at trying some different things with the pizza's as well (better them than me!) rather than the same tired combo's.  I HIGHLY recommend the white pizza.  OUT OF THIS WORLD! I have never actually dined in...I always get take out but the place itself is uniquely arranged, seems quite clean and included a small outdoor seating area.  Not the most spectacular view (parking lot) but they can add outdoor seating to their resume... One thing I've always noticed is that I have always been greeted with an enthusiastic 'hello' from the hostess upon entering.  A nice touch!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5?start=40
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3083,6380,5218,3.0,1/3/2012,"I have been to CPK many times and now that we moved to Columbus I was craving their food again. I must have remembered it being better and a little less pricey. I wanted to order my staples, the avocado egg rolls, the spring rolls and the semsame ginger dumplings but after seeing that alone would run me $30 I tried hard to remember which ones were most worth it and settled on just the avocado egg rolls. getting 3 egg rolls cut in half to look like more for $10 made me cringe, but they did taste good. Not amazing but fine, still next time I think I'll give the spring rolls a chance again. I also tried the new crispy mac n cheese which I guess was a better deal with 4 for $4. It was greasy, panko battered mac n cheese nuggets with no flavor. They tasted ok, I mean who does not like mac n cheese or anything fried but really not worth it. We also got the orginal bbq chicken chopped salad which was good and alot (full size) buut $14 for a salad you would want alot and i did not like how the chicken was cold fresh out of the fridge. For pizzas we got the new habanero carnitas which was also flavorless and for my husband the meat cravers which he always gets and is the only item ""manly"" enough for him on the menu. Fine but again pricey $14 a pizza we kept thinking how much you would get at Papa Johns for $10 a large specialty that actually tastes better! Sorry as much as I thought I love CPK I think it will be awhile if at all before we return!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5?start=40

Linh N.,"Granville, OH",0,6,184,1.0,10/2/2011,"So we ordered two pizzas and dynamite shrimp to go and as we sat there waiting for our food, we noticed one of the chefs not wearing gloves and while making our pizza he kept wiping his face and grabbing the food.  It really grossed us out so when I acknowledged the hostess she had the manager talk to us and he said it was for sanitation purposes he did not wear gloves because people wash their hands more often when not wearing gloves.  As soon as he talked to us they gave us complimentary pizzas and when we left all the chefs had put gloves on.  Needless to say, I am not going there again because it's so not sanitary to make food with no gloves on! Anywhere you go, they wear gloves when making food!  He basically lied to cover their mistake! Ew!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5?start=40

Emily H.,"Chicago, IL",38,192,12,4.0,7/26/2007,"As a chain, this is virtually the same as the location at Easton.  This is not negative, however, as I've always had a pleasant experience at both locations.  They both are frequented by parents with young children, so if that bothers you, I would not recommend CPK.  However, I think that the food is inventive and they really do have some interesting pizzas.  I always plan to try something new and always fall back on the tostada because it is delicious, and doubly delicious as a cold lunch the next day.  There is a full bar, desserts and appetizers, and doesn't feel nearly as cheesy as some chains can.  Give CPK a try and see if you can't find one of their 30+ pizzas satisfying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5?start=40

Dee C.,"Blacklick, OH",2,65,,3.0,8/15/2015,"I visited the Polaris CPK. I love that they have great small plate options. You get to try a tapas style menu with your companions if you like. I tried the white pizza which had great flavor. The arugula and asparagus salad is just okay of you don't add anything to it. I asked them to add beets so that I didn't get a bland,  all - green salad and I'm glad I did. They truly need to reconsider that salad. The service was good, though a little slow for lunch. The restrooms at this place are extremely smelly and nasty though, so do your business elsewhere before going here to eat.  CPK is a decent place to eat if you're looking for variety that isn't outside of the norm.

John T.,"Columbus, OH",2,29,204,3.0,3/22/2015,"Sunday afternoon at the Polaris mall... We called and they're sorry, but they've stopped offering call ahead seating.  Entering the mall, the restaurant has windows on two sides so you can see at least 12 open tables and booths... but the wait is still 20 minutes. Why?   The answer for both becomes clear...Short on wait staff.  When finally seated, it was our waiter's first day on the job. We had to familiarize her with the menu. Not sure about the kitchen either, since three of our four dishes arrived... followed by number four... which was being remade because someone has added a wrong topping to the pizza. Fortunately they caught it.  They did not feel like they could hold the other food any longer. The food is good, but service needs help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5?start=20

The last time I came, my pizza was slightly deformed and they made me an extra one to take home before I even knew they messed up the first one!  Also, all CPK locations offer complimentary bread before your meal but only if you ask for it! Edit: I may have jumped the gun on that review. I think it really matters what server you get. The last time I ate here, my waitress forgot about my drink (I could see her chattin with a coworker the entire time) and when I asked her about it, she lied and told me the bartender forgot to make it. I watched her walk up and grab the drink and then handed it to me. It was disgusting and watered down at that point and did not offer to get me another.

Nick C.,"Westerville, OH",1,9,,1.0,1/23/2016,"My wife and I went to the California Pizza Kitchen location at Polaris Mall for lunch on 1/21/16. Later that day my wife was notified by her bank that there appeared to be fraudulent activity on her card, with charges in Texas and Colorado. The bank closed the card and placed a fraud alert after we confirmed that these were not legit charges. The following day I contacted the corporate office for California Pizza Kitchen and explained to them that after speaking with law enforcement, their POS machine could be compromised or it was possible that an employee was skimming cards. I was told that someone in management would call me back the same day. I never heard from anyone from California Pizza Kitchen after my call.

Katlin A.,"Columbus, OH",110,108,68,3.0,8/18/2011,"So on my recent visit I figured out that California Pizza Kitchen serves more than pizza... who knew?! Now, I know this is a chain, but some of the best yelpers may dwindle of the dive restaurants and check this one out, so I figured a review may be helpful.  I usually try out a new pizza here whenever I go and it is usually split between friends (since shopping at the mall really works up an appetite) This time I tried their carnitas tacos.. yum! They were light and a small meal, but the perfect size for an early dinner or late lunch!  I also went ahead and sampled the best part of their menu which is the beverage menu. I had their mango mojito and boy was it delicious, almost too good to be a grown-up drink, so of course I took advantage and ordered more!  So this place is a great stop with friends when scouring malls but their food does not have any special zing to it-- but hey I may be bias to the other pizza places around town :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5?start=20

Carrie K.,"Columbus, OH",1,23,3,4.0,9/22/2013,"Excellent service from Michelle, our server. Tipped her over 25% and still felt it should have been more. She was friendly, knowledgeable and honest about the menu. When our pizza was made wrong by the kitchen, she apologized profusely, offered to give us the messed up pizza anyway to take home if we wanted it, and rushed the correct pizza out to us. When she brought water, she brought an extra cup of ice for us too (isn't that the worst, when by the middle of the meal you're totally out of ice and drinking lukewarm water?). She really knows her stuff. The pizza and salads were fresh and delicious. Got the California Veggie pizza this time. I've had more delicious pizzas from them (the CV just wasn't my fave, but that's on me for choosing it), but I have no complaints about freshness or quality.

Doug B.,"Granville, OH",4,19,1,4.0,12/15/2014,We had the pepperoni pizza and it was very good. The crust had a nice flavor that was not lost in the sauce. Nice blend of cheese. Service was good.

Alana H.,"North Olmsted, OH",151,98,28,3.0,4/19/2012,"I've decided I really want to bring into style the phrase ""num nums."" And this is what I thought while eating my meal at CPK the other night. I went here on a whim with my boyfriends parents, because they love the salads and I love the company.  We ordered the lettuce wraps to start, and I will admit that, although a tad salty, I do really enjoy their lettuce wraps. They have a lot of flavor and the lettuce balances really well with the sauced chicken. However, we had two orders for our table, and both were sized very different. One was heaping with chicken but barely any lettuce, and vice versa for the other. I'll overlook it though, because it ended up being plenty. My boyfriend and I split the BBQ Chicken Bacon pizza on their honey wheat crust. It was gewwwd my friends. I was pleasantly surprised, because I had read some real mediocre reviews on their food. I thought it was bursting with flavor and the crust was light and tasty. We definitely ate all of it and could have eaten more! The 'rents both ordered salads. They've had all of them by now and enjoy every one. However, I didn't ask them to analyze it so I can't give too many details. For dessert we got a brownie sundae and a key lime pie. The sundae was SO good. Warm brownie and cold creamy ice cream. I was definitely a big fan of this. The Key Lime pie was good, but far from authentic. I guess what do you really expect from CPK, key lime pie is hard to make exactly right. It was far better than Sarah Lee, though! The service was generally good, it wasn't 5-stars, but I didn't at any point feel neglected or rushed. Our server was very nice and helpful.  So overall this place gets 3-stars in my book. I'll go back if invited, but i'd never say it's a craving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5?start=20
Kevin S.,"Columbus, OH",0,6,,2.0,9/21/2014,"One afternoon, I stopped by CPK at Polaris while shopping alone. When the host greeted me, she said, ""Just one?"" I confirmed I was dining alone. She condescendingly responded, ""Aww, well, I'm going to put you back over here."" She led me to a corner booth next to a trashcan. I would have preferred a bar seat, considering my intention was to have a couple drinks and a light meal. Upon being seated, I felt quite pathetic by my choice to dine here alone during a Friday lunch. The waiter slightly made up for the hostess' ridiculous attitude.

Kristen N.,"Dublin, OH",87,70,,3.0,1/3/2011,"Deciding where to go to lunch was the easy part today.  Making my BF think HE was the one who suggested it was the difficult task.  I knew I wanted CPK baja fish tacos because I devote several REM cycles a month to dreaming about them.  I assumed the BF wanted a salad so I casually mentioned that I heard they had good bowls of lettuce and things.  My master negotiation skills worked and we found ourselves in a relatively empty dining room for a late lunch.  Generally speaking there was nothing fantastic or terrible about the experience since it's basically a mid priced chain restaurant that overlooks an escalator and a papyrus card store.  As mentioned before, I tend to think the baja fish tacos are the bees knees though.  They are simple with fried mahi mahi, coleslaw and avocado (for an extra buck).  They are served with tortilla chips and some pretty tasty salsa.  The salsa is probably the best I have had, chunky and flavorful but not too spicy.   The BF got a half cob salad that was a smaller portion than other half lunch salads Ive had (i.e. Mimi's Cafe).  All the components were there: lettuce, bacon, onion, cheese, dressing, avocado etc but it didn't seem like the flavors were really there.  It was as if we were eating prop food.  At one point we actually attempted to sprinkle on salt and a whole lot of pepper - I can't recall another time I ever though about salting a salad.  It was peculiar.  I've had the pizzas before including the original BBQ chicken (hey, when in Rome, right?) and it was pretty good.  At some point I also had some chicken, garlic, mushroom pizza that is no longer on the menu.  Based on my experience this was a good decision by CPK.  The garlic was way too much (there really isn't such a thing as a little garlic is there?) and the pizza did not work so I am glad to see it off the menu.   The waitress was a bit absent minded and vapid but seriously its CPK at the mall so as long as I get a coke when I ask (no more than twice) I am not going to complain.  The crew was probably still trying to recover from the yule tide shopping season so I'll cut them a break.   Overall - it's better than eating at the food court.  The pizzas are unique.  The fish tacos are worth the trip.  The salad  was possibly made of paper mache.   Go here, or don't.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5?start=20
Shruti S.,"Columbus, OH",3,66,182,4.0,11/18/2017,"Situated in the comfort of a mall, better food and service than food court. Place is huge inside, ample of seating inside outside. Benefits of being in a mall a lot of parking, bike parking available and the bus has a stop here( who so ever wants to get here, not sure about the number and route). Regarding food and drinks. Drinks are average, their thin crust pizza is amazing. While plenty of salad bowls and customization available for e.g. If you want to have spicy chipotle chicken pizza without the chicken they will oblige happily no fuss, vice versa goes for adding chicken shrimp etc.  Portions are great, one pizza for two, don't order half bowls/salads coz prices just vary by $2 or $3. Better take full and share. Be mindful of that. We ordered spicy buffalo cauliflower as an appetizer, it came out with shredded celery on top and ranch dressing and buffalo sauce on bottom. Cauliflower cooked well, and tasted real good.  We got simple house salad from their salad bar, which was pretty standard.  Finally chipotle chicken pizza without chicken, very well done, tasted great, nice flavors. Not disappointed at all.  Good job CPK. Price and food matched themselves, its moderate pricing. Be prepared if you come in at 5-6 you will get seats, by the time we were done 12-13 people were in waiting on the waiting outside.  Be mindful of that, so fill up first then shopping . On a short note- they have reward program, you get points when u eat here. It's not credit card, just a reward card. Give it every time you dine and accumulate points. I have reimbursed more than $40 and plus 81 points still in my card. That's pretty good. Do ask server to join, instant discount.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5
Hannah S.,"Columbus, OH",126,2,1,1.0,11/3/2017,"I ordered a takeout/delivery order today 11/03/17 - $93 for myself and co workers thru a delivery vendor (Skip The Dishes - highly recommend) It took the restaurant over 20 minutes to confirm my order to the point where Skip the Dishes called me and advised to cancel.  I called the restaurant and asked them to confirm - mind you I placed the order just after opening - and they were unable to because they didn't have the right ingredients as listed on the menu. I had to swap out crust for 2 pizzas, and pasta for a dish I ordered. That's fine - I'm flexible, however I HAD to call them to make sure my food was prepared and confirmed. They had my contact information and they could have confirmed with me 15 minutes prior when they realized.  The delivery vendor also had to wait over 20 mins over the expected time for the food to be ready.  My personal order was a Pesto Penne (had to sub for regular penne after requesting multigrain) I also ordered a side of ""roasted fingerling potatoes"". Not only were both dishes cold and dry I paid $5 for the below photo of potatoes, not one had been eaten or manipulated prior to this photo. I wouldn't call these much more than steak fries. And the amount for a $5 side of fries is unacceptable.  I am highly unsatisfied and will NOT be returning to them for food service ever again. Not for dine in and never again for delivery.  Over 5 of my coworkers had the same sub par meals and none of us will be repeat customers. Especially after paying $90+. I work at a massive corporate firm across the street and will continue to share my experience to ensure no one else wastes their hard earned money on food that doesn't even come close to a fast food chain quality.

Dani W.,"Columbus, OH",105,59,125,4.0,9/3/2017,"Short version:  It's pizza. That's all I need to say. The end.  Not as short version: Seeing as how this is located inside Polaris, we've stopped here for dinner a handful of times when chasing kids around and going to multiple stores has just drained me. They're cool with you parking your stroller behind the host's stand, or against the wall. Service has always been friendly here and even on Saturday evenings I've never had any issues with wait times.  They have an app that you can order takeout with, and it has a rewards system built in. My server has always asked if I'm signed up and takes my number, but if they don't mention it be sure to (first sign up and then) tell them you're a member so you can get your points.  I've only ever gotten the four cheese (or is it five cheese?) and tomato pizza because I'm predictably boring. The bacon and the sausage are both really good here so I'll usually ask for that added on as well. I usually don't pay much attention to the crusts of pizza, but I always notice that theirs is really good. All the non-pizza menu items sound good, but I've yet to branch out. They have ""fancy"" non-alcoholic mixed drinks that are always really good, I usually opt for whatever seasonal one they're featuring.

Nicole S.,"Grove City, OH",281,65,577,5.0,8/22/2017,"I was treated me to an incredible meal last week at CPK Polaris. Each dish that arrived was better than the last.  Our first two dishes were the bianco flatbread and the spicy buffalo cauliflower. What I loved about the cauliflower was that even after being breaded and soaked in buffalo sauce it still came out crispy.  Next up was the avocado club egg rolls which were the kids absolute favorite. Served with a homemade buttermilk ranch and I'm not a huge ranch fan but could drown in this batch. There was also a ranchito sauce which was a more spicy ranch but I didn't find it any more spicy than the regular ranch.  The salad course included one of their new powerbowls which was healthy and fresh. The veggies had crunch to them and was a perfect balance of being healthy but filling. A few of my favorite dishes came next. The cedar plank salmon which was served alongside succotash made for a perfect sweet + salty dish, the wild mushroom strozzapreti which was insanely flavorful and hearty and finally the wild mushroom pizza drizzled with truffle oil. The truffle oil is an add on but trust me and add it on. It really adds to the flavor of the pizza. I will say that my fear is that those that are not the biggest fans of mushrooms would skip the strozzapreti but don't. This dish really had my heart and was done so well. I cannot wait to go back for this dish alone.  A sangria flight accompanied my meal + my favorite of the three that was included was the beehive {made with white wine, Cointreau, lavender and puree strawberry}. If you're looking for non-alcoholic, I would choose the cucumber reviver {pureed pineapple and cucumber with a hint of mint} sweet and refreshing. The strawberry mango cooler was also quite yummy and the kids favorite.  The dish that was the highlight of the meal was the butter cake. 3 layers of cake merged perfectly together. The first layer is a thin layer of granulated toasted sugar, second layer is yellow cake and the third layer is cheesecake. Topped with vanilla ice cream and served warm, it melts in your mouth. Even if you're full - get this dish. It really completes the whole experience and is so worth the extra full belly.  I really can't rave enough about the experience we had. Everything was perfection. From the food to the service. If you go at lunch, they have some really great lunch time combos like pizzas and salads and soups and sandwiches.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5
Jennifer D.,"Dublin, OH",95,94,189,4.0,12/16/2017,"My favorite:  the spinach artichoke dip,  Sicilian pizza,  and Hawaiian pizza.   I get the Dane thing every time.    Today I tried their rib eye steak.   Why did I order steak at a pizza place???  It was ok.  Not bad. I will stick to my usual and maybe other pizzas from now on.   Staff  is nice every time I have been there.   For such a busy place everyone works very well as a team.  I noticed even if it's not their table they still do not mind helping the guests with condiments add other things.   Whatever they cannot help with, they make sure you speak to someone who is available to help.   Great team work,  clean restaurant, great pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5
Rian W.,"Westerville, OH",83,5,,3.0,1/2/2018,"My wife ordered the BBQ chicken pizza with avocado. It was pretty dang good. The sandwich I ordered (with Tortilla soup), and the kids Mac and cheese my daughter ordered were all delicious. The server that waited on us could've been a little better. Our drinks largely were empty throughout our visit: when eating something with a little spice, you need to take a little more than a feeble attempt to refill drinks. When we were ready to order, we had to wait about 15 minutes to find our server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5
Tina C.,"Davie, FL",99,67,120,5.0,4/7/2017,"Consistent good food and great service. We are very picky when it comes to how we like out pizza done and they get it right! If you can, please check out Zack at this location, we refuse to sit with anyone but him (or his sister who is amazing too). Pizza made to order. We are regulars there for a reason.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5
Jon A.,"Galion, OH",117,113,277,3.0,1/2/2017,"Drove an hour to Polaris Fashion Place, on New Year's Day, to eat at Molly Woo's.  Upon arrival we discovered it was closed...sigh...  My wife and I hadn't been to a CPK in years and decided to give it a shot since it has a gluten-free menu and is also in the mall. We arrived at approximately 2:00 p.m. on Sunday and were seated immediately.  If you haven't been to a California Pizza Kitchen, it is essentially a slightly upscale pizza chain that has quite a few other options (salads, pasta, mixed drinks, etc.).  Interior decor is nice and the volume is about average.  My wife orders a gluten-free BBQ Chicken Pizza and I try the super exciting cheese pizza (sarcasm); true to normal form, I go with light cheese, heavy sauce.  Prior to our pizzas arriving I am served baked bread with olive oil and herbs.  My poor glutenless wife glared at me for at least ten minutes, envying my bread and oil, wondering how I could possibly be so inconsiderate (I like bread - give me a break).  Bread and oil proved to be decent.  Pizzas come along at about the 20 minute mark.  My cheese pizza is ok - maybe a little above average, but nothing memorable.  Good enough to eat, but nothing to write home about.  Want an amazing cheese pizza?  Try Borgata Pizza Cafe just off 161.  Actually, if you want any great pizza, including GF pizza, go to Borgata.  My wife's gluten-free BBQ chicken pizza sucked.  Chicken tasted weird, had no cheese, almost no sauce, and the crust was mediocre.  I tried a piece of her pizza and agreed - not good.  I always try my wife's GF pizza wherever we go and have learned that a good gluten-free crust will rival a regular crust.  This crust was way off the mark as well as all other components.  She should have received a much higher quality pie for $16.59.  Our total bill was $33.40 without tip and service was average.  I have had worse pizza, but was not blown away.  Will probably be quite a while before we return, if ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5
Lauren O.,"Provo, UT",60,61,3,2.0,10/7/2017,"Underwhelming. Less than average food for a high price. Lazy and unattentive service. Bread was basically a dessert since it sat in the counter so long and the waitress forgot to bring it, it was brought with the check and it was 2 tiny pieces. The Thai pizza barely had any sauce and really had no flavor. It's really no surprise the Easton location closed. Skip and go get a wood fire pizza at harvest pizza for the same price and much higher quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5
Sarah P.,"Columbus, OH",62,313,11,5.0,6/8/2016,"Came back again today and everything was great, as usual.  However, I decided to try something new and it was so good I had to update my review to just talk about it.  What was so fabulous you ask?   THEIR BUTTER CAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Girlfriend, let me tell you, this was one of the best cakes I have ever had in my entire life (and I have eaten at a lot of expensive restaurants).  It's served warm with homemade whipped cream AND you can also get ice cream if you like (now you know I got the ice cream too).  It was sooooo good I seriously told my husband I wanted to go back there JUST FOR THE CAKE.  It's so soft and warm with the ice cream melting all over it.

P S.,"Westerville, OH",0,43,56,1.0,8/13/2017,Party a 20 birthday party for my niece. Every pasta dish that we ordered from chicken and shrimp Alfredo to the chicken tequila .. the pasta was not close to being al dente it was more of al plastic. Family was too worried about sending dishes back since it took forever just to get water refilled. Chicken fish tacos were overly fried and dry. Only thing decent was the corn and guacamole appetizer. Definitely not one of the best experiences here,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5

Robert L.,"Brentwood, TN",259,264,,4.0,6/19/2017,Pretty good for a chain they need to open one in the Cincinnati Area. This is a good location near the awesome mall of Polaris.

Jasmine P.,"Charleston, SC",45,71,22,5.0,8/13/2015,"I love CPK! They have the best food here. I always start off the avocado rolls and the hummus and pita bread. The ranchero sauce they serve with the avocado rolls is amazing! I usually get the fish tacos with avocado or the BBQ chicken pizza. The fish tacos always has fresh avocados on it. The BBQ chicken pizza is their signature pizza so it is always amazing. The BBQ sauce is so sweet, if suggest pretty much everything on the menu. The restaurant is always very clean and you can also sit outside on the nice days. The servers all really know the menu and the managers are always out walking around checking on the tables. It is a little bit cold in there, so bring a light coat. Everyone should go here at least once!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5
Anna S.,"Columbus, OH",69,350,262,4.0,7/21/2015,"While I abstain from writing reviews for chain restaurants, I have a HUGE soft sport for the CPK Polaris location.  I worked as hostess and a server at this location through high school and college.  Honestly, my foodie-ness blossomed here, when, as a young person, I discovered wine pairings and foods quite unknown to me (I know, I'm waxing poetic about a mall pizza chain).  And, I met my fiance here (long story).  In any case, this is still my favorite CPK location and while many of my old favorites are no longer available (Singapore Shrimp Rolls!), I still come here a few times a year (read:  many times a year).  Here are my most favorite items with some of my go-to modifications: Chicken dumplings (so, so good)  Mac and cheese bites (eat with Cholula) BBQ chop salad (no chicken sub avocado) Kung pao spaghetti (add chicken and shrimp; extra sauce; rotini/fusili noodles) Five cheese (add sausage) Sicilian pizza (add serrano; thin crust) Tostada pizza (add guacamole; add serrano; thin crust) Tricolore salad pizza (add shrimp) Veggie (wheat crust; add bacon; add goat cheese) Wild mushroom pizza (add truffle oil) Butter cake Salted caramel pudding Key lime pie",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5
Ashley R.,"Marion, OH",4,54,29,1.0,1/29/2016,Omg. I used to love this place until my most recent visit... I ordered the margarita pizza spicy chicken kinga quesadilla and caramel peach salmon salad. My pizza was absolutely horrible there was barely any cheese on it I asked for grilled chicken to be added on the pizza and they had it on the side. My quesadilla was very small and soggy. The salmon salad barely had anything on it other than greens. I can't believe i spent $50 on this meal and everything came back all wrong and not how i wanted it. I don't think i will be making any future visits here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5
Jill P.,"Columbus, OH",25,2,,2.0,5/6/2017,"Ending our birthday day of celebration with a light dinner we left quite disappointed.  After ordering drinks, an appetizer, 1 pizza and a kids meal...we waited almost 20 minutes for our crispy Mac n cheese then atleast another 30-40 minutes for 1 pizza and a kids meal. The server called out it took too long and then offered to send the manager over..we said it was fine but he sent him over then after excuses that the kitchen failed our server returned to apologize for sending him over stating he ""didn't want to embarrass us""...we were not embarrassed..and now I was getting offended. In the end the manager compensated a birthday dessert that we were already going to order...how thoughtful after waiting 50 minutes for 1 pizza and a kids meal.

Shea H.,"Vernon, CT",93,252,972,4.0,4/23/2013,"Another place that will bend over backwards to accommodate vegan requests.  I didn't expect such treatment but I ended up feeling like a normal guest here with a variety of options to choose from (usually, especially at chains, I am forced to eat steam veggies and fries, which makes me feel weird when I'm out with a group).  We sat at the bar and our waiter was excellent (wish I could remember his name).  He answered all my questions about ingredients and went and asked the cook when he could not answer, which I appreciated-- a lot of people just make up something when asked a question they cannot answer.  Basically you can order any pizza and just have the cheese removed (i.e. CPK has a crust and sauce option that is without animal products.  It was very good--- very very good.  Any my husband enjoyed is non-vegan dish too--- everyone was happy.  I always enjoy myself here despite it being a chain (I tend to have low expectations for chains) and would recommend it to vegans and non-vegans alike!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-columbus-5
