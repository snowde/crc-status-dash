Alex A.,"Miami, FL",2,101,14,4.0,1/13/2018,Continue to come here and I can tell that things are starting to turn around for them. The food has become more consistent and you can't go wrong with their salads! Overall a great family friendly restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-coral-gables
Christian D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",91,165,215,2.0,9/9/2017,"If this had been my first trip to a CPK, I can tell you that I would not ever return to one.  I came here on a Sunday around 630pm, which to my surprise, the place was not busy at all. In fact there were only 2 tables that had people at them. Imagine the annoyance when we had to wait 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge we were waiting to be seated. I do not understand that because there were 2 more parties that came in after us, too, so there were about 10 people up front. A server actually sat us, and while she was seating us the hostess managed to walk by us and say thank you to the server.  It was overly loud in the restaurant, with the volume of the music and the overall loudness of the employees. Normally I would not mind the employees having a grand ol' time, but we were sitting, waiting for anyone to pay us a visit to see if we wanted a beverage.  That took, no lie, 10 minutes. The ONLY reason we did not leave is because my GF and I did not want to chance going somewhere else at that time and have to wait even longer. Finally, the server came and asked us about our drinks. He was a nice enough young man, but for some unknown reason, the hostess kept giving him all of the tables for the subsequent parties that came in after us, He had about 5 of the 8 tables. Meanwhile, the rest of the staff was having a heehaw of a time standing around being loud. We placed our order of a salad to split, i got a pizza, and my GF got the appetizer flatbread. The food came faster than any part of our  experience. The food was good, temperature appropriate, and the salad was nice and fresh.  Our server checked on us once, and I never got a refill on my iced tea, which was annoying because he refilled waters all around us. We had to flag someone down to take our bill to be paid because he was still too busy waiting on his other tables.  Lucky for CPK, the other sites up in Sawgrass and Ft Lauderdale are great.  Like I said, if this was my first experience at a CPK I would never return again. You can bet I will not be returning to this location. There are plenty of other restaurants on Miracle Mile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-coral-gables
Alejandro S.,"Miami, FL",71,11,5,3.0,8/27/2017,My third time here... this is an average place with average food and price. It's never to crowded and they have a lot of options on the menu. It's a good option if: - If you want pizza or tipical american. - If you are with your kids. - if you are looking to have some beers with friends.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-coral-gables
Andrew R.,"Lake Nona, Orlando, FL",93,14,19,4.0,12/31/2017,"The prices here are a little high, but he food is definitely quite good. I had the California Club pizza, and my dad had the California Club Sandwich with a Mediterranean salad. He sure seemed to enjoy his food, and i definitely liked my pizza. The dough was of a good texture and it was cooked just right in my opinion, not too crispy, not too chewy. It had a nice, warm, fluffy center. The pizza didn't have a lot of sauce on it, which was nice. I think sauce on pizzas can get overbearing at times. Unfortunately, they only had one TV in the far side of the bar area. I wish there was at least one other one on the other side. I think they're aiming to keep the restaurant side from feeling like a bar, but i think another TV won't kill that vibe. The service was good; no complaints there. Overall I enjoyed the experience, and i wouldn't mind coming back to this restaurant if I was in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-coral-gables
Katrice S.,"Miami Beach, FL",31,39,114,3.0,10/16/2017,"This was my first time at this CPK, and I must admit that the fact that it was in this area I expected a little more. Walking in it felt like a Denny's to be quite honest. The staff was fairly nice, but our server clearly did not know what he was doing. He didn't know much about the menu, and he cane off a bit awkward every time he approached our table. The food was good, but not the greatest. The most enjoyable thing was the cocktails.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-coral-gables

Yummy breaded chicken with arugula salad . They also give warm and toasty just made bread complimentary.  The place is cute kinda has this pizza diner type of vibe to it .  The service is always the best ! All of the waiters are just the best . They always take your order just how you ask.  The dessert, wow they all are delicious in there own way . My favorite is the yellow cake with vanilla ice cream just delicious.  Oh and the lattes they have are pretty great as well !

Kimberly K.,"Miami, FL",934,183,392,5.0,1/1/2017,"Finally, I've tried the famous California pizza kitchen after 23 years of life! It sure lived up to its expectations. Rick and I started off with buffalo cauliflower appetizer just for kicks, not knowing what we were in for since we've never tried this. Omg. This is the best vegan substitute for hot wings ever! Everything about this makes you feel like you're actually eating a chicken wing except it's cauliflower and healthier cause of that simple fact! The buffalo is on point and it was so lightly battered on the outside just for texture that you wouldn't have known. I would order five of these just as my meal haha  For an entree, we shared the four (or was it five?) cheese pizza and added tomatoes sauce on thin crust. The crust is basically nonexistent cause it's so thin and there's so much cheese that the body of the pizza is way thick. Next time I'll go for thick crust with such a cheese pizza. The pie itself was god sent from heaven though, yummy ooey gooey cheesiness in every bite! We finished off on a sweet note, the salted caramel pudding. LOVE! Perfect size for two to share and so easy to finish. Awesome balance in all flavors from the salt, to the whip cream, caramel pudding and chocolate cakey cake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-coral-gables

Mauricio V.,"Miami, FL",69,98,48,4.0,11/6/2016,"I had read reviews about the avocado egg rolls so we had decided to order some as appetizers as well as bianco flatbread. As for the main dish, the carne asada pizza caught our eye and so we ordered one. We didn't realize how much food we had ordered but they were all pretty good. The flatbread was delicious, especially dipped in the olive oil that they gave us at the beginning. The avocado eggroll was good, but in my humble opinion, some of the more favorable reviews built up expectations in me that were not met, but my girlfriend would beg to differ. As for the carne asada pizza, it was really good, especially with the salsa verde that was given to us on the side. The server had suggestes we try it with a thin crust but we opted with the regular crust; he claimed it brings out the flavor more. We will have to come back and try it as suggested. The service was great; we were quickly attended to and the food also came out just as fast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-coral-gables

Desiree F.,"Miami, FL",95,3,2,2.0,11/19/2017,"We go to CPK every time we go to Actors Playhouse in the Gables. We never think to go anywhere else because it is next door to the theatre, the menu is varied and service is good.  Last night we were HIGHLY disappointed. We ordered avocado rolls (like always) and our meals came and we never received our appetizer.  So we kindly told our server to just cancel the rolls (which gave us an eye roll and annoyed attitude).  My pasta was like warm at best, my husband ordered the ribeye with potatoes and I believe it was arugula.  The steak was perfect but the potatoes were cold like they had just come out of the fridge.  We had never ordered that before so we weren't sure if the potatoes were to be served warm or cold so we asked the server and she brought us new potatoes. The problem was the warm steak was sitting on top of the cold potatoes which made the steak somewhat cold.  They did bring us a side of potatoes (about 15 minutes later) and we were finished with our food.  On my pasta dish I ate three bites and took the rest home because the flavor was good but I cannot eat cold pasta and I brought it home.  We ordered a butter cake and asked for just the cake and she put on ice cream which we specifically didn't ask for.  So in turn we were charged for something we didn't ask for.  This was also the dinner for my birthday and it was highly disappointing.  We spent $68 for a steak, potatoes that were cold, pasta that was cold and a dessert that wasn't what we asked for.  There are many restaurants we could have celebrated this birthday and show at but we chose CPK because it is a tradition for us.  We are disappointed and frustrated that the one weekend we go out in a month for our entertainment nothing came out right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-coral-gables
Gaby F.,"Miami, FL",224,184,810,4.0,10/7/2015,"I have been here at least six times. I have left content every single one of them.  Once I ordered a pizza without cilantro but it came with the cilantro. They quickly apologized, brought me a new one and even let me take the other one ( my bf ate it later). Great way to recover from the mistake. I forgot about it, fast. I have tried at least 6 of their pizzas, 2 of their crusts, a couple of their salads, their cheesecake, their pudding, all delicious.

Ute L.,"Denver, CO",434,865,1197,2.0,5/19/2016,"Packed with noisy kids all over the place, even sitting by the bar didn't help. The kiddie birthday party kept our waiter tied up permanently, leaving us waiting and having to ask other staff for our food and drinks. Our drinks finally arrived mid-way into the pizza. Wasn't our waiter's fault, he had to deal with obnoxious special requests. He apologized and comped our drinks. Still annoying.  As for the food, just looking at the nutritional info on the CPK website is enough to induce a heart attack. There's a reason they don't print it on the menu. To give you an idea, their lightest thin-crust pizza clocks in at 1,200 kcal and 400 fat calories. Roasted veggie salad (sounds downright healthy, right) 720 kcal with 460 fat calories. Yikes. Dessert anyone? Butter cake a la mode 1,380 kcal with  830 fat calories.  The lightest option on the entire menu is the arugula quinoa salad. I nixed the cheese and opted for fat-free vinaigrette. They did get that right but forgot to put the pine nuts in my salad. Another thing I had to hunt our waiter down for. I got my side of pine nuts when I was nearly done with my salad.  Again, not the waiters fault if he has to tend to an obnoxious party of 12+ but I am sure that happens here quite often. They should plan accordingly. My condolences to the staff who works here, having to deal with this crowd.

Sabryna L.,"Miami, FL",57,321,487,4.0,12/6/2015,"California Pizza Kitchen is the Gables' best kept secret! I highly reccomend to everyone the Crunchy Thai Chicken, either in salad or pizza form. I usually opt for the salad version, and I literally have dreams about eating this salad. I was addicted for a couple weeks, but I had to stop coming back because the staff would recognize me so it got awkward. With the salad, they put crunchy wontons strips, all the crunchy vegetables you can think of, AND peanut dressing - you can't say no! I usually substitute the chicken for avacado and it's the best salad I have had in my life. Aside from the salad, I would also highly reccomend the butter cake served with vanilla ice cream. It is so light (not in calories, but you know what I mean) and fluffy, and mixed with the ice cream it is the perfect desert. I would not reccomennd the tiramusu dessert, it's more like a cheesecake consistancy and it is very heavy and rich. I would also not reccomend going during lunch because the service is slow, so it will be at least an hour and a half lunch.

To start out with I got the spinach artichoke dip which is always delicious. It's one of my favorite spinach artichoke dips around. For my entree I usually go for the grilled chicken caesar sandwich with a side of tortilla soup, but I decided to actually have one of the pizzas this time. Side note: the sandwich and especially the tortilla soup are delectable. I recommend both, and I was really torn between getting the tortilla soup or spinach artichoke dip. This time around, I got the roasted garlic chicken and my friend got the mushroom pepperoni sausage. Both were amazing and both hit the spot. We were too full to have some dessert even though the red velvet cake looked great. Overall, it was a great experience and the food was great too.

I think if its a date or a dinner with just a friend then my recommendation is to go with a half salad to share (believe me, there will be enough for both) and a pizza to share as well.  So far on my CPK expeditions I've tried: - Original BBQ Chicken Pizza  - Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Pizza  - White Pizza - California Club Pizza  My utmost favorite so far is the California Club, it practically has a whole salad and fresh whole avocado slices on top of chicken, smoked bacon and etc.  I also have tried the Sangria and was pleasantly surprised because I was definitely not expecting a decent sangria from here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-coral-gables?start=80

This is typical, though, so why I'm surprised - I don't know... Last issue - I could swear that the veggies used to be baked into the pizza.

CPK is always crowded. There is always at least a 30 minute wait. No thank you. I've seen this at the Pines location too. I'm not a patient person, and there are plenty of pizza places where I don't have to wait. They won't have the awesome chicken club pizza, but I shouldn't eat it anyways...which brings me to.... 2. CPK is ridiculously unhealthy. The restaurant scores a D+ on Eat This, Not That. I never want to split a pizza there either. I want the whole thing to myself because it's yummy, but I'll be angry later when I step on the scale. So, I avoid it. Their menu is deceiving too because things that seem like they might be healthy options are pretty high calorie meals. Part of this is because they have large portions.  I've tried a few other things there, and it's pretty hit or miss on flavor. I think I order the best thing on the menu!

We were seated a few minutes after walking in and shortly after our sever came by to introduce himself. He asked for our drink orders and starters. Our appetizer came out before our drinks so the person who delivered the food (someone from the kitchen) noticed and brought our drinks himself. It seemed as if our assigned server forgot about them. Therefore, I give my review 4 stars. Nonetheless, we ordered our meals and I tried the Cream Pesto Penne with shrimp pasta. OMG! It was delicious! I'm not into pesto but this is an exception.

Irene H.,"Miami, FL",2,39,15,3.0,7/23/2014,"CPK and I go way back. I'm talking about 7 years or so to when they first opened in the area. It kills me to see where this restaurant is today and compare it to where it used to be. It wouldn't be unusual for me to be there three times a week at one point. Now? Once every few months.  Over the years, local management has changed, as has franchise ownership. And employees who were there for many years are now mostly gone and the turnover is high. Recipes have changed, service has slowed down, and prices have gone up. I don't mind paying a premium for a high quality dish, but definitely not for a mediocre one.  My last visit was one of the worst I've ever had. I tend to sit at the bar when I'm on my own or with my spouse as it's typically quicker (or it used to be) and more casual. The bartender at the time was Khat. It took a few minutes for her to acknowledge we were there. Note: there wasn't anyone else at the bar except for two other folks who were waiting for their take-out order to be ready. When she finally came over and asked us what we wanted we ordered our drinks and food. She walked away, pulled two glasses out, and walked into the kitchen. I thought she was getting something or a takeout order was ready.. nope. Just hanging out, talking to people, playing with utensils.  TEN minutes later, and still no drinks, Kim, one of those long time employees I mentioned earlier, walked over to us to say hello. She knows we've been sitting there for a bit and asks if we've been helped yet. Guess what? Kim got us our drinks immediately. No sooner does she put our glasses in front of us does Khat come around the corner running to try and help us. Nice try, but no thanks. The food came out shortly thereafter. Honestly, it was alright. Not worth the money we paid for it. Eventually we needed refills. Again, time went by, no Khat in sight to help us. At some point, the gentleman, who I presume would be taking over the next shift, had arrived. I didn't catch his name, but he was incredibly attentive. He and Kim get 5 stars.

However, I can no longer handle how awful their take out service is and I think everyone should know.  Every time I get take out, the portions shrink by 40%.I have mentioned this to the manager but nothing ever gets done. I've run several trials, and it can be concluded that the portions are different when you get take out as opposed to dining in. Not only is the quantity different but so is the quality. The food is done in a rush, and not cooked well.   Perhaps if they reduced their prices making it proportional to  the amount and mediocre quality they are providing I would be okay, but instead I just feel ripped off. In addition, they always forget to add the bread when they say they would and every time I go, the process of getting the food and paying is eternal which negates the whole purpose of take out.  Do not get take out here.

Nicolas B.,"Miami, FL",0,33,,2.0,4/12/2017,"My wife and I go to this location practically every Friday afternoon for dinner with our two year old. We like the pizza. Service however, has been a hit and miss since day one. Sometimes you will come in (not busy by the way) and sit there for a while before anyone acknowledges you. Only has happened a couple of times. Sometimes you get a waiter that isn't as good as the others. We have our favorites, but don't always get them.  Last Friday we went there and they brought to the table the usual bread and olive oil. We began dipping the bread in the olive oil and eating when after a few bites my wife says, ""I think there's a bug in the olive oil"". I said to myself she must be wrong. Sure enough, there is a dead fly in the olive oil. We call our waiter over and show him the fly. He's nice, apologetic and takes the olive oil away. A few minutes later the kitchen manager shows up and asks, ""how is everything""? Kind of a stupid question since the only reason she was there was because she was told that there was a fly in the olive oil.  She's not really apologetic. She only says, ""oh, it must have come in when the back door was open"". She also ridiculously says, ""I've never seen a fly in a kitchen before"". Then another ridiculous comment, ""we have lemons back there and I've never seen any flies around the lemons."" We ask if the olive oil is kept uncovered and she says yes, but she will start covering it now.  Isn't there a protocol as to how the olive oil is kept? This is corporate chain. There is protocol for everything I imagine?  What pissed me off me off is that the manager of the restaurant finally came to talk to us. She was nice enough and apologetic but never offered ANYTHING to make up for the fact that we were eating from fly infested oil. No gesture at all to comp any part of the bill or a free dessert, etc. That is something that is usual and customary in the restaurant business when something goes wrong with your meal isn't it?  Work of warning, check your olive oil for flies at this location. They blend in well with ther herbs they put in the olive oil.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-coral-gables?start=20

We ordered: - One of their flavors of summer cocktails: The strawberry mojito  This was the best order that night. Tasted awesome and had a good amount of alcohol.  -Spicy fennel sausage and poblano flatbread- It had sausage and mozzarella. It was alright. It was rather small, a bit light on ingredients, and the edges lacked ingredients.  2 or 3 out of 5....

I do eat spicy and I used the sauce some, but it was a bit overpowering. I can easily see someone not used to eating spicy foods wanting nothing with that spicy side sauce. It did have a decent portion of pork which I liked, and the cilantro complemented the dish well.   I would rate the pizza a 3 or 4 out of 5, I'll compromise with a 3.5 out of 5.  -Four cheese ravioli The portion for the ravioli was rather small... for ~$16 I expected more.

Took a few for waiter to come over and get our drinks. Hard to understand him, not very friendly. We got apps, which were very small. More like a personal app. Many got salads which the presentation wasn't awesome. Then the fun part started, had our waiter and manager come over multiple times and tell us they were cutting our pizza, it was coming right out. Only to find out they lost our ticket. We were there for 2 hours. Ended up we didn't have to pay for ANYthing (we did leave a tip). It was very nice of them to comp the meal, even though they lied to us on many accounts.

It's all been very good. The Small Cravings menu is pretty interesting and we liked the Korean tacos. The Avocado Egg Rolls and the Spinach Dip are out of this world. The Egg Rolls are pretty up there as my favorite right now. The avocado chunks are delicious and well-sized. I've liked all three pizzas I've tried equally.  The Red Sangria was WAY better than I thought it would be. Very fruity. The strawberry mojito is dangerously deceptive. And the fresh strawberries instead of strawberry puree are a nice plus. The butter cake is sinful with ice cream. Oh god it's delicious. I can't afford to eat here all of the time, but every now and then it's a nice treat. The cocktails are overpriced and I honestly probably won't do that again. But the food? Worth every penny. The boyfriend and I usually order one appetizer and one pizza and we can usually do one dessert too. This is the best way to keep it affordable.

Rebecca A.,"Miami, FL",133,82,125,3.0,12/25/2011,"Went here for a business lunch with a colleague and found that despite being on hoity-toity Miracle Mile, and despite being part of a national chain, this place is pretty good. We started with the spring rolls; you get to choose two flavors and we picked baja and thai.  The sauce that comes with the baja was plain marinara, cold, so that was not good.  However, my lunch mate knew about the ranchero sauce for another dish and we ordered that instead and it was great.  The thai spring rolls were everything you could hope for in terms of flavor palate.  I especially liked the peanut sauce for dipping, more sweet than spicy, though. I ordered the half order of the Moroccan Chicken salad, dressing on the side.  This was a very good salad with some very interesting ingredients.  Dates, butternut squash, and moroccan spice-rubbed chicken breast.  It comes with a champagne vinaigrette, which isn't really my speed, so I replaced with a dijon-balsamic instead.   I should point out, for all the replacing of sauces and small changes we requested, they were all instantly and easily accommodated by our waiter. For dessert we shared a chocolate soufflé with vanilla ice cream.  This is becoming a rather standard dessert item on many restaurants' menus, and ours was just that: standard.  Warm and chocolatey, it was quite good, but certainly not outstanding. Overall, I'd say this place is a great place to go if you find yourself on Miracle Mile for lunch.  The menu is incredibly extensive; everyone will find something they want to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-coral-gables?start=100

I was fiending for pizza, and we came up with this place.  The magic of Yelp is that we're supposed to try a new dish at whatever restaurant we go. You guys know I'm a Hawaiian Pizza addict (probably the only person in Miami who likes it.) Since I like sweet and spicy on my food - and wasn't heading to Joey's - I went for the Thai Chicken Pizza. Plain and simple, it's yummy! The toppings look fresh, the peanut sauce is just right for me, and even without the crushed pepper flakes there is that perfect afterkick of spiciness I look for. So why only four stars..Well, there isn't 4 and half stars, and I have to take them to task for the pizza crust, which was a little on the hard side. I ended up having to eat some pieces Hialeah style :) Not to be overly picky, but the drink refills for my iced tea werre a little slow in coming. The decor was nice, with the perfect amount of lighting. The ""pizza box as decorations"" added an original and creative touch. (Thanks for pointing the history of the artwork out J.C.)

Much better than most ""mainstream"" Italian restaurants! Service was great! About a month later  The second time, I went with a group of four and we got seated in about a minute and the restaurant was picking up. I decided to go for a pizza this time. I went with the chicken club pizza and unfortunately it's not what I expected. I was shy to say something to the waitress but my girlfriend edged me on so I decided to say something and told the waitress I wasn't really liking the pizza. Without hesitation she took the pizza and apologized and asked if there was something else I wanted to try and I went with the five-cheese pizza and within a couple of minutes I was eating and wow was it delicious haha!

They were equally delish!!!  For the entree, I chose the jerk chicken pizza and my bf chose the bbq chicken pizza. YUM!!! Both were amazing! Very good pizza!! The service was excellent.

I wish I could remember his name to give him props, but unfortunately, I do not. Their avocado egg rolls are amazing. Here are the pizzas I've tried: BBQ Chicken with Applewood Smoked Bacon Jamaican Jerk Chicken The Works Thai Chicken Wild Mushroom Goat Cheese with Roasted Peppers Sicilian Margherita Out of all of these, my two favorites that I could get over and over are the Jamaican Jerk Chicken and Sicilian. The Jamaican Jerk Chicken includes grilled and spiced chicken breast with spicy sweet 'Caribbean' sauce, and mozzarella cheese. Topped with applewood smoked bacon, mild onions, roasted red & yellow peppers and green onions. So flavorful with a spicy kick, don't miss out on this one. The Sicilian consists of a spicy marinara sauce with sweet Italian sausages, spicy Capicola ham, julienne salami, fontina, with mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Topped with fresh oregano and basil. Also noteworthy about this one is that it comes on a nice thin crust. I think you can sub any pizza to be on thin crust, but I'm not sure.

The food was fine but it seemed like my honey wheat BBQ chicken pizza was significantly smaller than my friends' pizzas and the service was a bit slow. It was fine b/c me and another girl shared the Apple Crisp dessert, very awesome... The ""fun"" part was the check, out waiter had the most difficult time splitting the check 6 ways, I think he almost had a heart attack.  He had to come back to the table to re-figure out who ordered what b/c he'd lost track and was sweating profusely. He was even taken off the floor b/c it took him about 30 min to figure out the check.  For the trouble we had, the manager didn't even come by the apologize for the inconvenience. Side note, CPK should really put the nutritional info on their website.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-coral-gables?start=140
Alex L.,"Miami, FL",0,26,5,4.0,8/2/2010,"What can I say about CPK, but that it's consistently good food.  They offer a wide selection of food to please any picky eater and they are a very family friendly restaurant.  My family and I have never had a bad meal yet.   Our favorites range from the Tuscan Hummus, Spinach Artichoke Dip and Asparagus Soup for Apps to the Original BBQ Chicken Salad, Steak/Fish Tacos and Chicken Milanese.  And of course, the pizzas!  Our son especially loves the Vanilla Haagen-Dazs Ice Cream with M&M's and extra cherries.   Special thanks to our favorite server Eric for always doing a great job!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-coral-gables?start=140
Kelly O.,"Miami, FL",32,350,70,3.0,6/25/2009,"3.5 stars I know, I know, it's a chain, gasp! But it's a good one. I am obsessed with their miso seafood salad. I have it almost every time I come after a friend of mine introduced me to it. The pizzas are good and I really enjoy their whole wheat honey crust. Also, they have red velvet cake (it's not the best I""ve ever had but it is good) and that to me is important. I love red velvet and almost no restaurants in Miami ever serve it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-coral-gables?start=140
Sarah S.,"Miami, FL",90,49,5,3.0,8/6/2009,"I love CPK, while they are known for their pizzas, what I come here for is the salads.  The original BBQ chopped chicken sald is the bomb, and occassionaly they have a miso lump crab salad that is also good.   The service is alright, slow at times, water service is slow, and occassionally the hostess will make you wait for a table even though there are empty tables.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-coral-gables?start=140

Stephanie R.,"Miami, FL",6,21,2,4.0,5/16/2010,"I went here yesterday with my brother after a Just The Funny Improv show, I will start off by saying it was a very good way to end the night. The California Pizza Kitchen is decked out in decor, art deco lamps hang from the ceiling to set a dim and very tranquil ambiance. There is music playing at an appropriate level which plays all the best hits of a wide range of genres. The staff was friendly and attentive.   The food, oh the food, very good! We ordered the Garlic Cheese Focaccia with Checca as an appetizer. The bread was delicious, very soft and fluffy, the diced tomatoes that accompanied them were also delightful. I ordered the WIld Mushroom Pizza, I love mushrooms so of course I was in heaven, I think i even saw the walls starting to move around. My brother called the cheese ""cocaine fluffy"" if that makes any sense to you good.. or not so good. We ordered the Hot Fudge Brownie Sundae and it didn't disappoint. The tab came out to about 50 bucks, my brother ordered pizza as well.  This place is missing one star because although I was impressed with the layout and the food was pretty good, it wasn't amazing or too out of the ordinary. I would definitely go again and recommend it to others but it wasn't 5 star material. Hope this helps!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-coral-gables?start=140
Cecile S.,"Miami, FL",172,225,208,3.0,3/15/2011,I'm not very impressed by this restaurant. When you first walk in it feels like an upscale dennys. The service wasn't terrible but our waiter kept asking us if we were ready to order when we were obviously studying the menu pretty intensely. Nothing jumped out at me. The food selection was average. We ended up ordering the 3 type spring rolls which were pretty tasty. My favorite were the Asian spring rolls that came with peanut dressing. The Greek side plate we ordered tasted fresh but was too small to share. The prices are high and the food taste commercial. Wouldn't choose this place over the other great restaurants the Gables has to offer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-coral-gables?start=160
Cristy M.,"Miami, FL",25,105,3,2.0,9/5/2011,"I'll give you that it's Labor Day. However, there's no excuse for remembering that you forgot what one of three of our party ordered over twenty minutes after we placed our orders or looking at my glass of water and going ""Oh, I'll bring you some more water"" and not coming back to refill said empty water glass for ten minutes.  The food was regular CPK which is OK, at best. I'm not a fan of the menu. I feel it lacks authenticity. I mean, yeah, ""traditional"" items like, say, Kung Pow spaghetti (SUPER traditional) and Mediterranean something or others on ""traditional pizza-pita bread?"" Ok. Consistent 3 stars from previous visits (based on the food)...2 is giving a bit much for our service today.

Gustavo A. L.,"Orlando, FL",831,1180,138,3.0,9/5/2008,"Like other reviewers, I had a preconceived notion of what to expect from this place judging by their frozen pizzas and their airport fast food joint - both of which are pretty dismal. Additionally, we visited this place in Schaumburg, Illinois about 10 years ago, way before they came to So Fla and found it to be quite BLAH ... Understandably we never returned - UNTIL NOW -  This place is just around the corner from my office and what great option it is... their salads are creative and outright wonderful - go for the half portions, its more than enough - Their wide array of choices in the pizza menu is bound to produce something that will delight you - I have tried five different pizzas so far and they have not disappointed yet. Reasonably priced - took one star of due to S L O W service... but I am sure that with time they will get it right.

Torrey R.,"Asheville, NC",92,133,47,4.0,8/21/2008,"Good bye diet... HELLOOO Pizza!  I frequent this place for their lack of giving me a second glance when I ask for tons of stuff on my pizza.  I like everything except those little fish.  They're happy to throw everything on, toss it in the oven and serve it up for me just the way I like it. They do have pasta, appetizers and some darn fine deserts on the menu for the more diverse people out there too.  For anyone who's never been to a California Pizza Kitchen, they serve up a variety of almost personal / almost sharing size pizza of better quality than average pizza shop.

Carla L.,"Orlando, FL",1033,1383,20,4.0,9/5/2008,"The last time I had been to one, I had not been impressed and had absolutely no inclination to return.  Someone (my dear hubby) recommended the place and we were in Coral Gables last night so I went back - I am willing to give second chances. I was pleasantly surprised, our waiter was SUPER attentive, it almost made me want to order more just because he was that good at up selling.  Unlike my husband, I didn't think that the service was super slow, it wasn't zippy but the salad did come out pretty quickly. I got the chance to choose EVERYTHING we were going to eat so I chose a grilled Japanese veggie salad (I am butchering the names of these dishes by the way, but you will know it when you see the menu) and a Tandoori Mango Chicken Pizza. Both were really tasty, very good - the presentation quite nice.  My man, was a little skeptical of the Pizza but ended up really enjoying it.  I loved it.  The sweetness of the Mango was fantastic with the light sprinkling of the cheese.  The salad had roasted veggies and I am a sucker for grilled/roasted corn.  YUMMY! The 1/2 portion was plenty as an appetizer for two and we also shared the pizza.  Portions were perfect. I would definitely recommend it and will be returning very soon as I am a salad freak and am not often pleasantly surprised as I was here! **Update..  we went back for a very late lunch.  In a place where there are approximately 40 tables, and at that time only 8 were taken, it was pretty bad that we didnt get our food until a full hour later.  There were 4 people in the cooking area, 8 waiters and one bartender.  Not cool to take so long and do NOT tell me that it was because you have to cook the pizza, because I make my own pizza crust from scratch and it does not take an hour to cook, and I am sure they have it prepared ready to cook. Otherwise the service was good, the delay was the kitchens fault.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-coral-gables?start=160

Lisa Marie A.,"Miami, FL",18,29,,2.0,9/2/2008,"I've been here a couple of times for lunch and was never really blown away, thought it was ""allright"" but my offical last visit here was this past weekend as i officially deemed this place as unworthy in my book. Everytime i've gone here the service has be SLLLLLOOOOOWWWWW. The first time i went, i blamed it on the waiter. The second time i went, i figured it was because my party was about 8 people and he just couldnt handle it. This last time i went, it was just 3 of us and STILL SLOW!. The staff is always too busy to pay attention to us. Not sure why, as this place was pretty empty. The pizza was very cold and tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for awhile. Im sure it was, and the waiter just never noticed. We took 2 1/2 hours to eat here, and all we ordered were two pizzas and a couple glasses of water. There's no excuse to take such a long time to make pizza. If Dominoes can make pizza and deliver it in under 30 minutes, then there's no reason why CPK cant do the same in less than 30 minutes. I say- skip it unless you want to eat cold pizza and waste 3 hours of your life listening to cheesy 90's music in the background.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-coral-gables?start=160

The first thing that caught my eyes was how cheap the beer are, $3 for a bud light. This was mind blowing haha. So we decided to split the Sicilian thin crust pizza and a house salad (which isn't on the he menu). The pizza was good but I would consider it more of a foccacia bread with toppings than actual pizza, The salad was more than enough for two people to share. The service was good my glass of iced tea was never empty and neither was my glass of water. Considering this place is a chain the food was good and so was the service. Would I go back?

We arrived about 4:30P & ""all"" 4 booth in front of the bar were covered in dirty dishes from previous customers, as were 2-3 tables in the dining room.
