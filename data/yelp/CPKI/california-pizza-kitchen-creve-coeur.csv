Tricia M.,"Saint Charles, MO",4,99,1,4.0,11/22/2006,"my neighbor thinks it's silly that they serve salads with chop sticks... but then again, she can't use them so she does not know why they serve anything with chopsticks.

Heather N.,"Brookline, MO",10,39,,4.0,1/1/2006,"Smoke-free dining.  Funky pizza.  Interesting salads.  Crowded but accessible.  These things all personify California Pizza Kitchen, which is a place I frequent at least once a month.

Mandie M.,"Saint Louis, MO",234,559,351,2.0,10/24/2017,My hubby and I were going to catch a movie at the AMC close by and thought we would grab a quick drink and a small app before the show.  We arrived around 6:10 pm and were able to walk right up to sit at the bar. When we walked up I saw a ton of fruit flies just sort of hanging around. It happens I guess. We managed to find a less inhabited by fruit flies spot at the bar and sat down. The server/bartender brought us some water and took our drink orders. We also looked over the menu and decided to order a flatbread. It's quick and easy!  She brought over our drinks and that was the last we saw of her for a while. When our flatbread was ready an expo person brought it to us and made sure we had plates and silverware. By the time we saw our server again was had to ask for our check and leave. We didn't even want to wait for our credit card to be run so we just left cash.  The flatbread was okay. The beer was cold. The service was just not-so-great.

It was just done.   I wish the food was better. The 3 other ladies ordered various salads. I ordered the lunch soup and salad with tortilla soup and a Caesar salad.  The soup was quite tasty but the salad left a lot to be desired.

Everything ended up working out and whoever made our pizzas made them extra large!  The crust was hanging over the edges of the plate when it usually doesn't even cover the edges. Always a plus with how expensive the pizzas are. They ended up taking our drink off, I guess because of the wait.

Not mind blowing, but not bad. But recently I have developed a strong affection for their California Cobb salad. IT IS SO GOOD - essentially a deconstructed fancy BLT (with avocado, egg, basil, and bleu cheese dressing). I've been ordering this salad to-go from this location roughly once a week, and the staff here is courteous every time! One of the waiters once even offered me water while waiting for my salad. I can't speak to the dine-in experience here, but so far I'm pleased with this CPK location!

Second, THERE'S TAPAS AT CPK!    I'm probably way behind in this, but somehow 5 years have passed and I have not been to California Pizza Kitchen.  I love tapas and fancy pizza so that will NOT happen again. CPK is a chain and there are several around STL.  So i'll give you a list of reasons to go to the one in Creve Coeur over the other restaurants around the movie theater. 1. Our server was awesome. In fact, everyone was very warm and welcoming. 2. Fancy pizza out the wazoo! This is an excellent place to go and split dishes, I always split a pizza, which is small ish for 2 people, and huge for one person and then something else.  Now, with the addition of tapas, we can do 2 tapas and a pizza! 3.  Fried Macaroni Balls. 4.  A grand selection of flavored teas.

Most of time, we can see people's happy faces enjoying their meals. Good service.  They gave us free bread before meal. Warm and nice. Draft blue moon, $5.99. It is not easy to find draft blue moon in restaurants. It is even cheaper than Budweiser. Half caramelized peach salad with salmon $12.99. It is the best dish tonight. it has everything I like. Will order it again. Half caramelized peach salad is $8.49, and I add with sauteed salmon $4.50. Worth it.  Mushroom pepperoni sausage pizza, $13.79. Delicious!

Our host was also our server which was different but no complaints. He was nice, friendly and attentive. He took our orders with ease and checked our beverages often enough. Food was good. Had the spaghetti with meat sauce. Had hot tea...really nice because you get your own tea pot, honey packet, and Tazo tea choice. My daughter has the kids pepperoni pizza which did not look appealing or good. My daughter is a picky eater but she tried it anyways for my benefit and I have to say not even I would eat it. There was barely any cheese and tasted on the spicy side. Not what you would expect for a kids pizza.  It was a quiet atmosphere. Pretty warm...I mean they really cranked up the heater where I couldn't finish my tea but considering it was cold outside...better warm than cold.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-creve-coeur

DJ J.,"Waco, TX",25,93,,4.0,4/25/2010,"It's a nice little joint with a wonderful atmosphere. I never get tired of seeing the old school oven. It's very rustic and wonderful. Our waitress was super nice, and even though I tipped her the min. 15%, I wished I tipped her more. I had the BLT pizza, which was good, but ergh, stupid me, I forgot it had mayo...BUT it was still  real good. I also had the raspberry mojito. It was okay; my friend had the mango mojito which was way better. Both were a little too sweet for my liking. Overall, I think that the meals were a bit pricey. The BLT pizza was around $11 which is expensive considering they slabbed stuff you put on a $5 footlong and made it this much. Yes, I could've ordered something else, but still expensive and this was one of the cheapest pizzas on the menu. Is it a considerable size? It depends on the person. I actually had to have a doggie bag for my food but I don't like eating all of my meals at once, but I easily could've. After we watched the movie, I chomped the rest of the pizza down all the way home. The best part of the pizza was certainly the bread. It was favlorful, moist. Everything pizza bread typically isn't. So two thumbs up for the ""el pan""! The mojito was not worth $7. I typically don't order alcoholic drinks cause I'm too busy muching on dessert, but I could easily have gotten the same thing somewhere else for cheaper. It was a big ""shot"" glass, but it was filled with ice. Personally, as a broke college student, CPK is one of those places where you go to on occasion. Yes, it is good quality food, but you're getting more for you buck if you get Little Caesar's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-creve-coeur?start=20

I ordered the lunch soup and salad with tortilla soup and a Caesar salad.  The soup was quite tasty but the salad left a lot to be desired. The bread they serve before the meal was about the best thing. It's sourdough and toasted and it's really excellent.  I'm sure I'll be back but I won't be the one to choose it.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-creve-coeur

I've been ordering this salad to-go from this location roughly once a week, and the staff here is courteous every time! One of the waiters once even offered me water while waiting for my salad.

In fact, everyone was very warm and welcoming. 2. Fancy pizza out the wazoo! This is an excellent place to go and split dishes, I always split a pizza, which is small ish for 2 people, and huge for one person and then something else.  Now, with the addition of tapas, we can do 2 tapas and a pizza! 3.  Fried Macaroni Balls. 4.  A grand selection of flavored teas.

My daughter has the kids pepperoni pizza which did not look appealing or good. My daughter is a picky eater but she tried it anyways for my benefit and I have to say not even I would eat it. There was barely any cheese and tasted on the spicy side. Not what you would expect for a kids pizza.  It was a quiet atmosphere.

Our waitress was super nice, and even though I tipped her the min. 15%, I wished I tipped her more. I had the BLT pizza, which was good, but ergh, stupid me, I forgot it had mayo...BUT it was still  real good. I also had the raspberry mojito. It was okay; my friend had the mango mojito which was way better. Both were a little too sweet for my liking. Overall, I think that the meals were a bit pricey. The BLT pizza was around $11 which is expensive considering they slabbed stuff you put on a $5 footlong and made it this much. Yes, I could've ordered something else, but still expensive and this was one of the cheapest pizzas on the menu. Is it a considerable size? It depends on the person. I actually had to have a doggie bag for my food but I don't like eating all of my meals at once, but I easily could've. After we watched the movie, I chomped the rest of the pizza down all the way home. The best part of the pizza was certainly the bread. It was favlorful, moist. Everything pizza bread typically isn't. So two thumbs up for the ""el pan""! The mojito was not worth $7. I typically don't order alcoholic drinks cause I'm too busy muching on dessert, but I could easily have gotten the same thing somewhere else for cheaper. It was a big ""shot"" glass, but it was filled with ice. Personally, as a broke college student, CPK is one of those places where you go to on occasion.
