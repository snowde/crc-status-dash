Katie T.,"Denver, CO",116,25,8,1.0,2/28/2016,Just really unhappy the last 3 times we've been here. Service is great but the food is not. I love California pizza kitchen in other areas but this one the food just has not been good. Very low quality food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-denver-6?start=40
Brooke B.,"Denver, CO",57,119,1,5.0,7/31/2015,"So I work in the Cherry Creek Mall and its hard to not get sick of the food. But California Kitchen has such a good variety I don't see myself ever getting sick of eating here. Although I do wish they did a employee discount for mall employees like Kona grill does. I would eat there everyday if they did! I love the bbq chicken lunch duo with the baked potato soup. So good !! Yesterday I went in to kill some time after work and eat some delicious food. I got The Garlic Fettuccini and I added shrimp. I always add shrimp to my pasta anywhere I go. I've never had so many shrimp added and they were a good size too. My Server/Bartender Vincent was freaking great. He was super attentive. He offered bread and oil before while I was waiting for my pasta and I thought that was great. I felt bad because I sat at the bar and didn't order a beverage but im pregnant so I cant at the moment, but I also didn't want to take up a table for just one. Ill be here a lot from now on because everything was great. Maybe after my bambino gets here ill be in for a glass of wine there selection looked nice.  Thank you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-denver-6?start=40
Mathew P.,"Denver, CO",0,12,,3.0,8/3/2015,"The food is good enough - California pizza kitchen quality and the staff is nice enough.  This place is soooo weird though... Like Alice in Wonderland weird.  There are about 6 employees to every customer, so you are constantly being asked how your meal is while you are trying to eat. At our last visit, managers were running around like little anxious bunnies with headsets on engaging in what seemed like way too much conversation with customers.  Understaffing is not an issue at this place.  The amount of staff here makes you feel overwhelmed and awkward.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-denver-6?start=40
Helena H.,"Elmhurst, NY",732,930,446,2.0,9/24/2012,"You know I've given you soo many chances California Pizza Kitchen.  But this time i was SUPER dissapointed. After long hours of shopping it was dinner time, picked this place by the mall and they seated us instantly.  Waitress attended us right away, served us water and took our order. Food came in quick, about 10 minutes.   Here is the PROBLEM......... My Friend finished his meal first (He ordered a Pasta dish) before I did (I was half way eating my Pizza).  The Waitress came up, pick up his dish and said HER:    ""Would you like any dessert or anything else? Friend: ""no I am full""  HER:    ""Ok, I will bring the check"" (As you remember, i was still eating and only HALF THE PIE). 2 minutes later, She bring the check....... I don't think is RIGHT to bring the check while I am still eating.... That's how RUDE this place was..... NOW.... in terms of FOOD. I ordered a Thin Crust Pizza Salad..... The Toppings were all in the MIDDLE of the pizza.  The Pie was already Cut, but the Salad and the Cheese was on TOP of it.  So whatever I pulled out the piece, everything was falling apart and I had to pick it by using my fork.   I don't know if this is a way to eat a dish.   ____________________________________________________________ NOTE:  Dinner time was 9 PM... and the restaurant was half empty, so there was NO Rush for us to LEAVE.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-denver-6?start=40

Kyle R.,"Westchester / LAX, Los Angeles, CA",0,13,,4.0,8/20/2015,"Extremely happy with our service, today. Our waitress Kendra went above and beyond for us. One of our pizzas came with onions when we asked for none, and she politely brought out the one with onions, said she made a mistake and to keep the pizza and the correct one would be out shortly. Both managers on duty came by to check in and apologize. The only reason they're missing a star is because the front of house could use some help. We walk in and about 5 hosts are all chatting but just stare at us, no words or anything before we said hello. It was extremely awkward as we didn't know if we should seat ourselves or what. Nonetheless, we will definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-denver-6?start=40
David F.,"Denver, CO",52,73,54,3.0,11/23/2014,"They are good at what they do. Even so, it still is shopping center quick food.

Alex L.,"Denver, CO",179,821,392,2.0,7/21/2013,"This California Pizza Kitchen location has much room to grow on.  The food comes out slow, drinks are refilled slow, BUT the checks come out fast.  I have yet to have a good experience at this location and would gladly tell anyone to go to the Centennial location to be treated as a proper guest.  On my last visit, our waiter loved to chat with his coworkers.  When we started to cut loose with him, he started dropping F bombs and cussing up a storm.  That seriously confused me.  You're in a place of work, not a dive bar. Regardless, I would recommend coming here for grabbing stuff TOGO.  With the way the hostesses greeting the guests with a half cocked smile and a smart ass attitude, I see why this place looks empty during lunch rush.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-denver-6?start=40

Waited twenty minutes (was quoted 10-15) for a table with two hungry kids - only to be told it would be at least another 10-15. Watched folks in same size parties get seated before us.

Allie S.,"Denver, CO",66,598,193,3.0,4/22/2014,Not excellent pizza by any means but good enough to satisfy a pizza craving without spending a fortune in Cherry Creek! Good and fast service.  Attendants were attentive and the food came out as expected...hate it when chains don't provide the expected service.  Going to a chain restaurant already implies that I'm not looking for surprises.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-denver-6?start=40
Kelly G.,"Aurora, CO",119,389,7948,3.0,11/11/2012,"We went for the free pizza and beverage since we are both Veterans.  The free pizza is good for today and tomorrow which is more time and a better value than other places offering a free appetizer or entree.  The server gave us a business card to come back again before 25 Nov for more free pizza and a beverage.  That is a very good customer relations to do that.  The location of this CPK is in the mall on the street level.  They have valet parking out front, otherwise the closest parking is near Nordstroms.  When we arrived for lunch there was only one other couple in the restaurant.  By the time we left, there was a line out the door. I ordered the Habanero Carnitas on original crust and my husband ordered the Sicilian on thin crust.  Both were excellent with plenty of toppings and flavor.  The habanero sauce was served on the side which was good.  The server was efficient.  He brought us new glasses of Pepsi before we even finished our first glass.  And he asked if we wanted a soda to go.  The server even took the little plate my husband was using while he was finishing his last slice of pizza. We will be back soon.  Thank you CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-denver-6?start=40
Richard M.,"Denver, CO",0,9,,1.0,3/3/2015,"Had lunch there recently.

Catherine A.,"Denver, CO",0,5,,2.0,9/27/2015,We were very disappointed when they took away our favorite pizza. The habanero carnitas pizza with the salsa was the only reason we visited CPK. We will not be returning. I'm so sad!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-denver-6?start=40

Michelle S.,"Denver, CO",109,423,,4.0,12/29/2013,"One of my favorite spots to come grab a salad for lunch. Their pizza isn't bad either but they took away the Greek pizza which was so yummy!  The one downfall of this location is it is ALWAYS crowded and the service is never consistent. However, yesterday we stopped in for a late lunch thinking it would be easy and it was...packed. However we learned a new trick! Sit at the bar! It's open seating, so it's first come first serve but we grabbed 2 seats and instantly put in our drink and food order. If we'd been at a table I'm fairly certain it would have been 10-15 minutes before any of that happened.

Jordan S.,"Denver, CO",124,76,11,4.0,8/6/2017,"We dined here today (Sunday) at around 11:15 just after the mall opened. It was really not busy with only 2-3 other parties inside. The hostess seated us quickly and asked if we had been in before and how long it had been since the last time. Thought that was a really bizarre question, especially because there was no follow up to my answer, she just walked away. It quickly became clear why this is relevant... we received a couple complimentary pieces of pizza, delivered by a manager on duty, accompanied by a coupon for free small plate on a future visit. The food was delicious and fresh. Our service was outstanding. CPK has really improved its standards and menu offerings and overall atmosphere. The problem for this location lies in the fact that Denver is expanding too quickly and people are moving away from chain restaurant dining.. especially at a mall that now charges for parking after one hour for which I don't believe is enough time to eat a meal here and for which I don't believe they offer validation. I predict this location will fail although it doesn't deserve to. The desperation at trying to get us to return actually makes me less likely to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-denver-6
Lex S.,"Denver, CO",124,158,260,2.0,10/9/2017,"CPK is a great chain restaurant, but I really wasn't impressed with this location at all. First of all, we walked in and there was no one there at the front desk... which wouldn't be a problem except for the fact we waited there for about five minutes and not a single employee acknowledged us! There were plenty of servers walking around that looked at a us a couple of times and that was it. It kind of seemed like they had a ""not my problem attitude"". I decided to stare down one of the servers and maybe that's the reason he finally came and got us set up with a table. So if you've ever been to a CPK, they normally bring you a plate of fresh bread for your table. Well, this is a first for me at CPK... our server brought my boyfriend and I TWO pieces of bread and it was hard and stale. I just kind of laughed at the fact he really just brought us TWO pieces of bread. The bread tasted like it was made the day before. Once we finished the two pieces of stale bread, our server asked if we wanted more. So we said yes and again, he brings us TWO pieces. Is this location stingy with their bread? That bread was actually hot, but the bottom was hard as a rock. After we finished that, I guess we reached our limit on bread because the server never brought us more. I ordered the cucumber lime refresher. It tasted great, like it normally does, but the mint in it was all old and browning. I would be embarrassed to server something like that. Our entrees were great, but my experience here wasn't. I would not come back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-denver-6

Meredith C.,"Chicago, IL",234,248,122,4.0,4/24/2017,"Once upon a time, I lived near Oakbrook mall in Illinois. At that time, it seems like whenever I was there and Hangry, the only choices for food were CPK, Houlihans or Thai basil. The CPK menu at that time was limited and it was only when I was in the mood for the barbecue chicken pizza, that I would endeavor the trek upstairs to indulge in this treat.   I have been in Denver for nearly 5 years and have not eaten CPK since in at least six. Recently, however, a friend suggested it when we were in the mall and starving. I was super stoked to read there obviously re-conceived and matured menu. I enjoyed what I ate (lunch duo: super spinach & quinoa salad & shaved mushroom & spinach pizza) and also sampled my friend's offerings including her mushroom, pepperoni, sausage pizza & strawberry mango cooler.  The food tastes fresh and innovative. It has great flavor and is served with care and precision which is unusual for a chain restaurant in my opinion & experience.  I enjoyed it so much as a matter of fact, that I actually signed up for their loyalty program.  Looking forward to my next visit which I'm hoping is this upcoming Tuesday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-denver-6
Clayton M.,"Denver, CO",0,9,,1.0,12/23/2017,Avoid this place. Disinterested servers did not approach our table following hostess sitting and after 10-15 minutes we left.

Scott R.,"Westminster, CO",463,37,142,3.0,3/24/2017,Have  been to many California Pizza locations and usually the service and food is top notch.  Had the hummus appetizer and thought tasted very plain and just loaded with tomatoes not much hummus.  Salad needed more dressing was dry and pizza was light on sauce.

Be prepared in case you want to come and relax. We ordered a few appetizers and had the bread and oil. Most of the aps. we're just not good.

When my food arrived there was no silver wear in the bag. Being that I'm at work and haven't eaten all day I was super bummed. I just spent $35 on pasta, and an ice cream soda, and couldn't eat it. I called back to see if the driver was still in the area and if he could swing back by with some. Apparently the drivers aren't part of the restaurant.

It is disgusting to have that much facial hair in the food industry!!  I observed him and he seems very upbeat, nice smile and good at his job too - but if he had been assigned to our table, I would have requested another server.  There should be some sort of grooming policy put in to place.**",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-denver-6

I had a gluten free pizza (mushroom sausage pepperoni), and honestly it was as good as a regular pizza. THAT NEVER HAPPENS! I loved it. I had too much to eat, so a couple of friends took a slice and agreed with my amazed assessment.  We had a wide variety of orders, and everyone devoured their food.

David T.,"Denver, CO",491,586,1,4.0,9/17/2009,"Restaurants in malls = bad idea, almost always.  I avoid both most of the time but I occasionally find my self in the Cherry Creek Mall.  It's only a few blocks from my house and the temple of all things Apple is there.  If I find myself there around the lunch hour I head for CPK.  Yes, it is a chain and I'm not a fan of chains but I am in serious like with CPK.  Not the pizza though.  I guess it's OK but it's a little too California and not enough pizza for my tastes.  Besides I can get them in the freezer case at Soops. So, why the 4 stars?   I have a serious jones for their appetizers and salads, especially the Singapore Shrimp Rolls and the BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad.  Yumbo.  The lettuce wraps are quite tasty and both the CPK Cobb and the ""original"" chopped salad are big, full of all kinds of tasty goodies, and you can pretend that you're eating healthy. I've always loved this space.  Really loved it back when when I could have one of Sfuzzi's amazing frozen bellinis.  It's bright and sunny, if somewhat noisy when it's busy, and it's always busy.  Service is pleasant and efficient.  Be ready for lots of little munchkins though.  And, this being the land of yuppie spoiled brats, chances are there will be lots of misbehavior.  Prices are not fast food tabs but this is real food and it's clean and fresh. So, if you find yourself in the area and your tummy is talking to you, you should give CPK a shot.   You might be quite surprised that you can have a quite decent semi-healthy meal in the Mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-denver-6?start=80
Jenn P.,"Denver, CO",104,181,17,4.0,1/11/2010,"So, I am one of those girls who simply hates ""going to the mall"". It leaves my nerves frayed, my wallet empty and me exhausted and cranky. I truly don't know how some of you ladies conquer them with such grace and efficiency. Nevertheless sometimes I need to go to the mall despite my disdain, in addition sometimes I must cart my children to the mall with me and often times we become hungry when we are there. Enter CPK....  It can get super crowed and crazy here and sometimes the wait time for lunch is lengthy, but you ARE at a mall so sometimes, if your smart about it, you can actually get other stuff done during your allotted wait time. This is good, and if you aren't able to do this, there are some Chery Creek snobs milling about that make for excellent people watching.  I have always had friendly service with a knowledgeable staff. Although once I ordered a vodka tonic and the server came back claiming the bartender ""didn't know what you meant by that"" ummm OK. How about a Cosmo? Anyway. The service is friendly and they do a good job holding down the fort, even in the peak of holiday mayhem and hungry shoppers.  The appetizers and salads are delicious and with a nice variety. I really like variety. The pot stickers or dumplings or whatever you call 'em are very good, succulent and savory and perfectly cooked with a divine sauce for dipping. The candied walnut, pear salad is AWESOME!!! It has all sorts of delectable treats on top and I have even fooled myself into believing it's ubber healthy, despite all the ""candy"" on my walnuts! The pastas are also quite good. I am a real Alfredo whore... I LOVE IT. The Alfredo here does not disappoint. It's gooey and rich and creamy and all of this makes mama happy....

Alden C.,"Tacoma, WA",4063,3498,745,3.0,1/18/2011,The pizza at the California Pizza Kitchen is pretty good. Again I will say that there are many other independently owned pizza restaurants in the area that are better though. We got a pizza with feta cheese and artichoke which was not too shabby. This restaurant is nestled in the Cherry Creek Mall. Depending on your opinion of the mall that could be either a good thing or a bad thing.

We usually get the bbq chicken pizza or the habineros pizza with some avocado egg rolls and it's always super yummy! The club pizza was ok, but wasn't great, it has a lot of lettuce in ranch sauce, tomato, and avocado on top of a regular pizza with chicken and bacon (I was expecting a different pizza and I just feel like we got a sub sandwich spread out on a pizza bread); we also got the fish tacos and fried Mac and cheese for the kid.  Fish tacos were really good, but for the money CPK should at least give you 3 tacos, we only got 2 with some chips. The fried Mac and cheese was good and the kid ate it up...   What makes CPK get 4 stars instead of 3? The service was top notch. Period. Lucas helped us out, I think he's the manager, and was on top of it! Really, made a big difference having awesome service like that. I know CPK has a ""love it or we'll make you some thing else"" type of policy, but we really didn't want to be a hassle so we stuck with the club pizza.

The salad was a little disappointing.  On the positive side, it lived up to the ""crunch"" portion of its name by being crunchy.  I like crunchy.  The ingredients were fresh, which is also good.  However, there were problems.  First off, the server sneak attacked me by asking if I wanted avocado on my salad.  Of course I want avocado on my salad!  Who doesn't.  However, I didn't realize the avocado costs an extra $2.50.  $2.50!  For an avocado!  Please, don't tell me that avocados are really that expensive.  Granted the restaurant needs to turn a profit on all its costs - I doubt that the avocado cost them more than $1.  I think the server should change his question to, ""Do you want pay $2.50 to have avocado on your salad?""  The salad itself resembled nothing Thai.  There was no flavor, let alone any flavors that would indicate that it might be Thai.  Though I was expecting authenticity by any means, I was hoping for just a hint of spicy with a splash of lime and salt.  That's all.  Overall, this restaurant is okay and has a few options worthy of regular consumption.  Combine that with the limited culinary experiences available in Cherry Creek Mall - you have an acceptable eatery.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-denver-6?start=100

I'm not ashamed to say I could probably drink it out of a cup and be a happy camper. For dessert, we went big and had the butter cake. After hearing a few recommendations we opted to add strawberry sauce on top and it took the flavor to a new level.  The manager Lucas and our waiter Felipe did a fabulous job of taking care of us.

It was the perfect starter to our meal. After looking over the menu we decided to start with the white corn guacamole and chips. We were delighted and very satisfied with our choice.  We then ordered the small wedge salad but being vegetarians we asked that the bacon and egg be removed and we added avocado and red onion instead. We also requested the herb ranch instead of the blue cheese. It came out just as we had requested and it was as delicious as ever. My sister loved it!  Jesus had recommended the mac and cheese bites earlier when we told him we were vegetarian, so we decided to get them. Man o man, my sister loved them! And although I only got one (my sister ate 3, lol) I was very satisfied with the recommendation.  After 3 small plates we were full but we still had room for dessert so we looked to Jesus for a recommendation. He suggested the butter cake and we were not disappointed. Although it was a little big for our liking we ate about half of it and we were finally full and completely satisfied.  Jesus made our experience extra special. He was attentive and he gave us some great recommendations. He made us laugh and we felt like we were his only table in the restaurant.  Overall 10/10. My sister and I have another movie and dinner date planned next week and we know where we are going for dinner. CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-denver-6?start=20

My husband ordered shrimp pasta primavera..it was served lukewarm. ..server Mariel's explanation was he was waiting for my salad to come out with it.  My salad was a cold, Mediterranean salad.  We asked Lea, the Serving Mgr to please take the dish back..she agreed..it needed to be warmed up...it was brought back...and the cheese was now brown and crusty because it had been tossed around in the pan as it was warmed up.  No one came back to check on my husband's meal..only on mine. In addition, I had to go up and  ask the bartender to order my sangria as our server never returned to our table to take my drink order.. No consideration on taking anything off the check for the inconveniences for this or my husband's lack of care  for his meal was made and 57.45 later..plus tip and tax..we will not be returning, unfortunately..there are too many good choices in the area..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-denver-6?start=20

I've been here on dates, during business meetings, and even just to spend some time with friends and I have always had a great experience with the entire staff. Extremely friendly and efficient people. The pricing is also not too expensive which adds to the appeal of the place, especially for lunch.  I'm a fan of the pizzas and the salads. Great portion sizes on both! The variety is really unique for a pizza place which keeps me interested in trying many of the items listed on the menu. Lemonades are fantastic during the summer too.

Jordan P.,"Denver, CO",81,225,29,3.0,11/12/2013,"I have been to a lot of CPK's and one thing they are is consistent - at least, that's been my experience. The food tastes the same no matter which one I go to. I always get the same things - the California Club pizza, the Chicken Tortilla Soup, and the Mediterranean Foccacia on the Small Plates menu. They are always good (the soup is beyond delicious!) and always the same which I can appreciate (although they have changed the mayo on the club pizza to a lemon-pepper mayo but it was very good). There is nothing amazing about CPK but the food is good, filling, and not incredibly pricey for what you get.  My 3-star rating really was based on my experience last night for Veteran's Day. This was my second year going and I was really excited as last year the service was great. I took a friend of mine last night and told her how great they were and that they had thanked me for my service so many times last year that it was almost overwhelming - but deeply appreciated. Last night, after showing my ID, our server barely acknowledged it nor did she even regard me as a veteran. As a matter of fact, she turned it into a conversation about herself! It was honestly embarassing as I had built them up so much and then to have them not once mention Veteran's Day in front of my friend, well, I kind of felt silly.  I did not join the military or serve for 10 years for free food or for recongnition - none of us do - but on a day devoted to veterans, a simple thank you goes a long way. I didn't even get that - which was pretty surprising after eating at Applebees and Einstein's earlier in the day where they were so incredibly genuine in their thank you's.  I won't return next year as I just found this almost disrespectful and had to wonder how many other veterans had the same experience. Just very disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-denver-6?start=20
Rebecca D.,"Delray Beach, FL",9,20,,1.0,10/26/2014,"The WORST experience I have ever had at a restaurant. I wish I could give my experience zero stars, but that isn't an option. Came in on a Friday afternoon, around 1p. Not super busy. After waiting a long time for a hostess to seat us, we sit down to a disgustingly dirty table that has other people's unfinished drinks on it. Seriously?  We wait at least 10 minutes if not longer to meet our server, who is clearly slammed and clearly doesn't have any time for us, let alone the nasty table we've been seated at. We flag down a different server to get the table cleaned. Someone comes over. As the bus boy is cleaning the table, the giant circles he is wiping the table with are flinging all of the crumbs that used to be on the table right into my lap. Never noticed, even though I'm sure I looked totally disgusted. He missed a lot of spots, but I didn't want to say anything lest I be covered in someone else's food. Speaking of food. It takes forever, even though we ordered right away since the server was so ungodly slow the first time. By the time we get the spinach dip, it's cold. We probably would have considered getting a different one, or getting it warmed up, but seriously, that server couldn't have run away from the table any faster than if she were being chased by the boys in blue. We get the pizza. The gluten-free crust is DISGUSTING. DOMINOES HAS BETTER GLUTEN FREE CRUST. My girlfriend is unhappy with her pizza and gets a salad instead. By the time all of this goes down, we just want to leave. The only redemption is that after telling a manager, he gave us our money back. Every other moment spent here was awful.

I don't necessarily look the part of a cherry creek shopper (not white, I am heavily tattooed etc) and my girlfriend and I sat down to enjoy our meal. Our waitress was more than helpful and took our order and regularly checked in on us. After we finished eating, my girlfriend and I were sitting there laughing at the fact I had lettuce stuck in my teeth, and the manager came by, put his hand on me, and asked if there was anything he could do, insinuating that we were going to dine and dash based solely on my appearance. This is something I take great offense to, considering I could buy the entire menu over countless times as I am a hard working individual with a steady good paying job, and just because of the way I look and was laughing, it required being talked to sternly?

The food: - Korean BBQ Steak Tacos - $5.25 - Korean steak, Napa cabbage, Romaine, onions, scallions and cilantro on corn tortillas. Topped with spicy chili sauce and sesame seeds; two small tacos with interesting flavor.  We topped the tacos with the habanero salsa served with our habanera carnitas pizza, which was a perfect addition. Recommended with reservations. - Habanero Carnitas Pizza - $13 - Slow-roasted pulled pork, red onions, cilantro pesto, Mozzarella and Queso Quesadilla cheese with SPICY habanero salsa; pretty good with a spicy kick.  Recommended. - Chicken Tequila Fettucine - $13 - Spinach fettuccine with chicken, bell peppers, red onions and cilantro in tequila-lime jalapeño cream sauce; the cilantro sauce was interesting; something about this dish didn't taste super fresh; the ingredients seemed dehydrated then rehydrated; the chicken was a bit dry, and there was an overload of onions.  I've been more impressed with microwaveable dinners.  Not Recommended.

Again, I don't mean this to sound snobby or anything, but I am kind of bummed by mall dining. All that being said, my kids absolutely love California Pizza Kitchen and it's their number one dining choice when given the option. They love the kids menu, which I think is well-priced and pretty comprehensive. Highlights: crispy chicken with a vegetable (tonight it was broccoli rabe!), mushroom-pepperoni-sausage pizza (for real!), and noodles. Just plain buttered noodles. Throw in a drink like apple juice and everyone is happy for at least 15 minutes. I'm actually pretty into the salad selection. I have deluded myself into thinking that I'm dieting by choosing the salad option, but tonight I had the Thai Crunch, a very tasty combination of edamame, shredded cabbage, crispy wonton noodles, and lots and lots of peanuts. It's very tasty and probably has tons of grams of fat! My issue with this location is the crazy parking. I couldn't tell if the valet was free only for BMWs or cars from a certain dealer or what.
