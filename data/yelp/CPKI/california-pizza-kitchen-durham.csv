Geetha V.,"Chapel Hill, NC",0,1,,5.0,9/10/2017,"A few of us visited CPK on Saturday (September 9, 2017), and had a great experience. We ordered a mix of Pizza, Soup, Fettucine and Salad. The food was excellent and the service was exceptional. It was a very hectic evening and the staff seemed to be very busy. There was a bit of wait to get a table and get the food as well. But the staff were very kind. I want to specifically mention MATT who was the waiter at our table. He kept a pleasant attitude while taking care of our complex order. When there was some problem with the computer while billing, the manager came and apologized to us. It took them a while to sort out the billing but they decided to not charge us for the order and even gave us a gift card. I call this EXCELLENT customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-durham
Mj R.,"Raleigh, NC",3,32,34,3.0,12/14/2017,"Vegetarian: I had the crispy Mac n Cheese for an appetizer and it could have been more flavorful. I had the Five Cheese + Fresh Tomato Pizza. I expected more flavor  from a pizza restaurant. My choice was pretty basic and I would return to try one of their other vegetarian options, they have plenty. Vegan: This is not Mellow Mushroom, so there are no vegan pizzas. However, there were several vegan appetizers, and salads.  Gluten-Free: They advertise 4 gluten-free pizzas on their online menu Allergens: The website says to ask a manager about allergies but there isn't an abundance of nuts on the menu.  Service: I came here with my dog and we ate outside. The waiter was very sweet to my puppy and even brought her water without me having to ask. The food came quickly and service was excellent. Recommendations:  There is a blurb to ask a managers about special dietary needs and I can tell they make a conscious effort to be inclusive. I can recommend this restaurant with confidence to other vegetarians and those with gluten-intolerance  but I hesitate to recommend this restaurant to vegans and others with specialized diets. Call ahead, and see what they say. I would come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-durham
Tilley C.,"Pittsboro, NC",50,1,,1.0,8/8/2017,This place is over priced for food that is not good.

Gail C.,"Jamestown, NC",76,252,102,4.0,5/13/2017,"I had a most pleasant chain restaurant lunch this week. A veggie pizza with goat cheese, split pea soup and a cucumber reviver. All three of these options were out of this world amazing. Great flavors, and best of all not overly salty like most chain restaurants mistakenly do. The non alcoholic cucumber reviver really did it's job after a brutal long week. I want to go back next week for lunch again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-durham
John S.,"Woodstock, GA",56,663,257,4.0,8/18/2016,"Pizza and salad restaurant. These folks are famous for their chopped salad and BBQ chicken pizza - this is what put them on the map You can come here and enjoy and great variety of pizza's, and salads. I ordered the California Cobb salad - excellent by the way. I also ordered a flatbread - nothing spectacular by any means. I recommend coming here for a SALAD or PIZZA - it's good stuff.

Elise P.,"Durham, NC",4,38,20,2.0,8/1/2017,"I usually enjoy this place, but today the CPK I once loved disappointed me. Service was slow, unprofessional, and too relaxed. Apparently they ran out of bread, RAN OUT. I don't know how I successful business can let this happen. We were sad because we come here for a good meal and bread. Anyway-our food took forever to get here and most of it was cold. Also took forever for us to get the checks. We were definitely not top priority. Waiting here for my check to come, I have so much time on my hands I figured I'd write a review. I hope my next visit is nothing like this!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-durham
Brian C.,"Cary, NC",2385,94,3,1.0,9/15/2016,"Definitely the worst experience at a Calif. Pizza Kitchen ever. Service was horrible, the table was dirty and no one came out to clean it. We ordered the Thai Chicken Pizza, which had hardly any chicken the first time we went. The second time, we asked for enough chicken to go around the pizza, so they uncharged us for asking for the norm!?! I guarantee you there won't be a 3rd time. Also, I call the customer support line and the person took my information, and said someone would call me back. But no one called me back.  There are definitely enough restaurant at the South Point Mall. To all my yelp friends, avoid this CPK like the plague! :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-durham

Lyndenise B.,"Miami, FL",294,532,2105,3.0,11/15/2015,"It was a beautiful day for a GF pizza in the super convenient location in South Point. I sat outside but it took about 15 minutes for someone to stop by and take my drink order. The waitress came back with unsweet tea that was meant for a gentleman at the table next to me. I already sipped the tea with my straw but when she came back with my sweet tea, she placed the unsweet tea on the other table for the gentleman to have. Idk if I was the only one that had a problem with that.  The pizza was okay but they definitely didn't leave it long enough to bake. The waitress was all over the place and kept forgetting what I had asked her. I know it's a Sunday but it wasn't even that busy. Hopefully other people have better experiences.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-durham
Latrice B.,"San Antonio, TX",2,59,11,4.0,12/19/2015,"Honestly, I've had the pizza here before and wasn't a huge fan. Still decided to try it again today because I wanted a good salad.  Ordered the shrimp Cesar salad and my son ordered the spaghetti bolognese and we were both delighted with our meals. Their bread was good, too. Again, I don't care too much for their pizza, but if you're willing to try other things on their menu, you'll be happy. Service was great as well. ;-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-durham
Tran N.,"San Jose, CA",602,118,669,5.0,9/2/2015,"This place was so packed! I was worried the service was going to be bad but our waiter was amazing! He was very happy and glad to serve my table. There was a lot of options that my table decided to split and order all types of food. The spinach dip was delicious. You can share it with a group of six people. The lemonade was also really tasty. I would recommend the raspberry lemonade! It is unlimited refill, my whole table got it because it was so good. The pasta was also delicious. The blackened chicken in the jambalaya pasta was a good touch. This pasta filled me up so much that I could barely touch the pizza. The pizza doesn't seem that big but you can easily share it with three people. So don't order too much or else you'll be bringing them home!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-durham
Kerry H.,"Raleigh, NC",0,9,,3.0,3/17/2017,I really love coming to get the tortilla spring rolls (thai and Mediterranean) but this time they were not half as good as I remembered them.

Scott W.,"Ashland, KY",0,88,92,4.0,2/26/2017,"Ordered a thin-crust pepperoni & sausage pizza. It was really good, but definitely pricey. Expect to pay $15-$20 for their one-size pizza.

Alex H.,"Durham, NC",117,90,235,4.0,10/28/2016,"Great experience. We stopped in for some pizza while shopping at Southpoint, and the service was great. Drinks we refilled when getting close to empty with us needing to ask. We love the pizza here, so the food was great as always. I ordered the Jamaican jerk chicken with serranos, and my wife ordered the carne asada pizza. Each of us ate about half of our pizzas, and the waiter brought boxes with sauce containers without us having to ask.

Lauren R.,"Manhattan, NY",184,121,204,3.0,5/21/2016,"CPK is always a fine choice when at the mall. It's usually a little less crowded than Cheesecake Factory so it's nice not to have a long wait. I came here for lunch today and it was good. Service was quick and waitress made plenty of stops at our table to ask how we were doing. I ordered the BBQ chicken chopped salad. I chose to add avocado to it, since avocado always makes the salad better! I'm unsure why the avocado isn't already just included in this salad though, because they really don't give you that much avocado for an extra charge. I ordered the half size, which I would highly suggest. I always can hardly finish the half size, so I'm unsure how big a whole salad would really be. The salad was super fresh. Ask for the dressing on the side like I did so it's not smothered with so much dressing and BBQ sauce.  Satisfying choice for dining at the mall. Reasonably priced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-durham
DLynn N.,"Cary, NC",128,72,67,3.0,9/26/2015,Went to CPK for a birthday dinner. There were 13 of us and I have to say we had excellent service! Had several pizzas and salads.

Muranda D.,"Greensboro, NC",9,139,,3.0,8/10/2016,"I went to this location on 8-13-16.  I ordered the citrus drink, I can't remember the name of it, but it was super good.  It was perfectly mixed, with no overwhelming tastes.  It was very refreshing for such a hot summer day.  Our bread was late coming out.  I have a feeling there was some already made, as other servers were taking bread out to their tables.  This location showed good teamwork though.  We had several other servers drop by and check on us.  The building was smoldering hot, though.  I was literally sweating by the time I left.  Granted, we were near the kitchen, but it made for a fairly miserable experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-durham
Jonathan Kimin K.,"Chapel Hill, NC",83,67,40,4.0,6/15/2015,"A great place for casual meals. I came here for lunch with the family and was content with the food served. I got the California Club Pizza which filled me up pretty well, although somewhat a sloppy entree. My sister and mom shared a Thai Crunch Salad and it wasn't too appealing to my taste. Maybe it was just this particular day that I went, but I remember CPK being a lot better than it was this past experience.  I would recommend the pastas and pizzas, and if you're looking for a decently healthy meal, the Waldorff Salad is on point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-durham
Chris K.,"Durham, NC",78,571,1169,4.0,7/7/2012,"I always have a great meal here, be it pizza (a huge list to choose from), salads (come in two different sizes and the large is really big), pasta (lots to choose from there too!), tacos, sandwiches, and desserts. It is a bit pricey, but we always leave with leftovers.  Some favorites are the BBQ Chicken pizza, Thai Chicken pizza, Field of Greens salad always hits the spot, especially the candied walnuts!  The Thai Crunch salad is also a favorite which is napa & red cabbage, chicken, cucumbers, edamame, wontons, rice sticks, peanuts, cilantro, carrots and scallions tossed with lime-cilantro and Thai peanut dressing.  Yum!

Paul J.,"Charleston, SC",11,111,26,4.0,12/18/2014,"My wife loves CPK, but I typically avoid it because I feel like I can find better pizza elsewhere, but who knew they made fantastic fish tacos? Be careful though with the salsa that comes with them, as burns may result. I might be the one recommending we eat at this place next time we're out. The wait staff has always been very patient with my child and are very friendly. The hostess helping to open the door and with stroller parking really sets the stage for having a good experience here. If I were the manager, I'd be proud of both. Feel free to go off the beaten path on the menu here, you may find your own pizza-less gem here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-durham?start=20

Jacqueline B.,"Chapel Hill, NC",0,8,6,4.0,12/29/2015,Salmon on the Caesar salad is indistinguishable from the croutons. Are these salmon nuggets deep fried?!

Jeff S.,"Cary, NC",146,301,105,4.0,12/19/2012,"4 stars because I can bring my kids here, and the servers always take great care of us. The little monsters make a horrible mess, but I try to leave an extra large tip to make up for it. Although always busy, we've never had to wait for a table. This is a big deal when you're at the mall and have a 1 and 3 YO going crazy. Well, they start out at crazy and it just goes crazier from there. I enjoy their salads. Yes, I said it - I don't go here for the pizza. My wife does, she loves their simple mozzarella, tomato, and basil pies. But for me, I'll get a half-sized portion of their Thai Crunch salad. If we're feeling extra hungry we'll get an order of their pita and hummus too. The hummus is OK, but the pita itself always tastes good. I like that they always have flavored ice teas - just be sure not to have them made with sweet tea - the flavoring has sugar as well, so go easy on the stuff, esp if you have a dentist appt in the next 3 months. I'd give this place 3 stars for the food, but the extra star definitely for convenience, service, and reliability.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-durham?start=20
David L.,"Chapel Hill, NC",292,80,,4.0,8/23/2014,"My roommate and I went here as our first meal together after coming from California. Yes. We miss California. We did expect this place to be a little different, with it not being in CA and everything. But we were surprised to find that everything was pretty much exactly the same. The traditional bread and butter as appetizer (PRO TIP: ask for ranch and red pepper, sprinkle red pepper on the ranch, and dip the bread in it. DELICIOUS), and the same menu they have back home. I recommend the BBQ chicken pizza, and pretty much any of the pastas. David's VPP (Value per price): 5/10",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-durham?start=20
Miglena K.,"Queens, NY",6,91,202,4.0,11/11/2014,"On a busy day such as Veterans Day they were able to seat us relatively quickly (only 10 minute) wait. The server came right away and we ordered the chicken dumplings which I didn't think were that great- the chicken Was so mushy and creamed on the inside you could barely feel any texture. The presentation was great, though. We also had the Hawaiian pizza - came out quick, the dough crispy, and it was not salty or greasy as other pizzas are. Not too bad; is probably garnish with less scallions- since they were fresh, there was a strong onion taste and smell to it. Wouldn't recommend that for date night for example.

Cloud R.,"Fairfax, VA",1,79,,2.0,2/2/2015,"Went to CPK after quite some time. The place was busy, but no waiting queues. We got a booth quite fast. Experience was truly awful - long wait time, the appetizers were bland and cold. The entrees arrived very late and the pizza had a hair stuck in it, while the soups were cold and bland. Absolutely unhygenic, disgusting food - should have just gone with a frozen entree from Trader Joe's and some pita chips at home. The check arrived and was almost 25$ a person, which to me is a lot for a lousy lunch!

Naomi K.,"Okinawa, Japan",432,1824,4621,3.0,9/28/2012,"Yes it's true, they took off my favorite pizza from the menu, no more peking duck pizza. I got the thin crust cali club, but the mayo and lettuce was overwhelming. The crust was sweet. Avocado was great, but the bacon and tomato could have been more plentiful. Sitting outside on the patio is great on a nice weather day, but they really need to do something about the wasps. Maybe hang a few wasp catchers. They were very aggressive in attacking your food. I'm surprised that no one's been stung yet.  Well, it was a desperate attempt to reconnect with California food, but in reality I just need to fly back for a visit. They do have some Cali table wine, which is an attempt, but a little unrepresentative of the real availability of California selection.

A half order is plenty for any meal, but generally I'll get the whole so that I can have some leftovers.  Don't get extra bacon. It's just not worth it. I like the CPK at Southpoint overall. For sit-down food it's hard to find good options at the mall but the CPK comes through. It's got food for everyone and I think a special kids menu.  My friends like the pizza, I like the salad.

Chas F.,"Tampa, FL",22,268,41,2.0,11/15/2011,"I usually love Cali pizza kitchen, but this one surprised me. I like going to chain restaurants while away from home because you can get what you know you like. They looked fairly busy but our party of 5 were quickly seated. We all ordered our usual. Four seasons, caesar salad, Hawaiian and cheese with olives. We sat there forever and ever! It seriously took like 30 min to get our pizzas! My four seasons looked like someone had dumped a ton of parmesan cheese all over it!! It has never come that way before and I hate parmesan cheese! But I was so hungry by that point I just ate it. The salad was awful. The lettuce was bitter and it seemed that they had washed the lettuce and didn't dry it before putting it into the bowl. So of course the dressing didn't stick. It was more like caesar soup! When the waiter finally came around I asked for the bill and luckily I had the exact amount. So we paid and got the heck out of there! Maybe it was just an off day here, because Cali pizza kitchen is so good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-durham?start=60

I called and asked if we could bring a cake in from outside. They were so friendly and accommodating. We called a few minutes before opening to say we were coming with 13 people to celebrate my daughter's birthday. They gave us a terrific waiter- Jacob- the best! and put tables together and gave us our own section. They provided bottomless lemonade, They lit the candles on our cake for us and brought it out. Jacob was awesome! Gave the girls puzzles to complete while they waited and gave out a prize. It was as if I had spent forever planning this. Could not have been better if I had! So thankful.

Michael M.,"Durham, NC",198,3,,2.0,8/23/2014,"We came today to try out California Pizza Kitchen for the first time, when we got there, there was a line out the door, reinforcing our thoughts that this would be a pretty good dinner choice. After waiting for 10 minutes for a table, we were seated and our order was placed. The food came about 10 minutes later, and was just awful. The pizza was lukewarm and soggy, the BBQ chicken salad was just plain awful, and we didn't get the bread as an appetizer, wasn't even offered to us. We poked around at our food and asked for to-go drinks and the check. 10 minutes go by without a word from our server, no drinks, no check. Finally, she brings the drinks, but still no check. 3 minutes pass, and she finally brings the check without saying a word. Put my card in, she took the check and brought it back and almost threw it on our table. It was an awful experience and we won't be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-durham?start=40

My friends and I came in tonight before the hunger games premiere and ordered a few pizzas to go (so that we could eat while standing in line of course).

Calvin P.,"Chapel Hill, NC",33,76,27,3.0,10/17/2010,"I know a lot of folks enjoy ranting and looking down their nose at chain store restaurants. But CPK is a fantastic example of  the advantage that national branded restaurants can have.  I go on a group movie outing with a local meetup group about once a month and when we go to a movie at Southpointe, we usually wander over to CPK afterward for a late dinner/beer/hanging out whatever. There's usually anywhere from 12-20 of us and various combinations of singles, couples, etc.  The good folks at CPK never bat an eye at our large, loud, group. They rearrange tables so that we can all sit together. They do a great job at getting drink orders to us fast and taking our food orders quickly. They work hard to getting people's food to us as quickly as possible. They never seem to mind all the hassles of creating separate checks for everyone.  I _always_ leave a generous tip for the staff at this CPK because they make it fun and easy for our large groups. Kudos to them.  Their menu is full of good comfort food. I almost always get one of their personal sized pizzas, which are generally big enough to take half home for lunch the next day. Good selection of appetizers. And yes, a few health conscious choices as well.  And true to their big chain stereotype, they are very consistent. I often get their goat cheese and red pepper pizza and it always tastes fresh, good, and what I remembered from last time.  My only gripe is for the beer menu. Meh. Given that they have a full service bar and quite a few wines, I'm surprised at how boring the draft beer list usually is and how few impor tbeers there are.  So I dunno. I guess I'm gonna give them a 3 stars for the food. Nothing wrong with it. Hits the spot, but not spectacular.   But a the same time I give them a virtual 4 stars for setting an example for customer service and I'm happy to go back to them in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-durham?start=40

We left after 30 minutes when it became apparent that the food we'd ordered 23 minutes previously wasn't going to appear anytime soon.  Our waitress was friendly enough and appeared to write something down on a ticket while we placed our order. Or was she just doodling? We had to wonder when about 15 minutes later some other dude came back and asked us what we'd ordered. And in between, we were offered at least two other tables'  food in the desperate hope it might be ours.  Watching all these poor waitstaff stumble out on the patio brandishing plates of food with no homes was a little comical.Or would have been if we hadn't been ravenous.With no sign of food in sight, no apology, no nothing, we beat a hasty retreat to the food court.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-durham?start=40

If I ever came say twice in the same week, maybe I'd try something else on the menu, but until then...it's a craving I've  got to fulfill.

Watched four parties get seated outside ahead of us. Once seated, our waitress took about 15 minutes to get our drinks. There was a hair in my brother's pizza.

Bethany A.,"Evanston, IL",312,315,50,4.0,12/15/2013,"I really like CPK's salads. The Cobb always tastes good and when I want something on the sweeter side the one with caramelized peaches hits the spot. Their pizzas are okay -- some of them are a little bit much for me, but I really like the CPK Club pizza. They put ranch on it, along with bacon and chicken and tomatoes and after it's baked, they top it with lettuce and avocado that's already been dressed (so kind of like a salad on a pizza) and it's delicious. Their pastas are okay, I liked the sauce for their chicken tequila pasta (it's a little tangy and not as rich) but there could have been more chicken and I wasn't a huge fan of the bell peppers and the onions in the dish. The spinach fettucine was a nice touch though. Their small plates are delicious. Asparagus and arugula salad with fresh parmesan and the white corn guac with chips... mm.
