Maulah A.,"North Hollywood, CA",81,33,6,1.0,11/4/2017,"I ordered takeout and brought home the pizza I ordered. When I got home, I realized the pizza was burnt to smithereens.  Why would they even box this up? I'm very disappointed in the quality. I was able to return the pizza for one that was cooked vs. burned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=20
Jen W.,"San Francisco, CA",695,1379,2318,4.0,12/5/2016,"I've never had a bad experience at any CPK.  Yes, it's a chain.  The food is not extraordinary.  But...something about the place has me returning once every year or so.   I do love the cobb salad.  It's probably the highlight of my visits.  Their dressing is homemade.  The salad is fresh.  And the portions are large. Second thing I always order?  Pizza.  We ordered half the works and half roasted garlic chicken.  It's a super thin crust which doesn't leave you feeling carb overloaded afterwords.   The bread and oil though, on the other hand, can put you into a food coma.   Service here was great.  They were on it and extremely friendly.  Parking is either at a meter in the paid lots.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=20
John A.,"San Diego, CA",16,83,117,3.0,7/18/2017,"Got here in the evening time , about an hour before they close. Although the place was far from been full , the host told me it's going to take 15 minutes . I choose to sit at the bar as the serve food there as well. The bartender/ server was very nice and welcoming. I ordered as a starter the veggie lettuce Wraps . People who came after me and was sitting at the bar got their main entree before I got my veggie wraps . It took 20 min to get it and the sever actually told my that my entree (mushroom pasta) was ready and she asked to redo it so it will be hot.  The food was ok , nothing more , nothing less . The desert was good hot chocolate cake). The place is nice and was a walking distance from my hotel which was convenient.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=20

Our server was the sweetest(didn't catch her name) she made sure our needs esp. my daughter's was met! Not packed at all for a Friday afternoon. Our food came in less than 15 minutes.

Christina C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",22,58,24,4.0,8/22/2016,Today when I came to CPK it was super busy! This host was very confusing with seating with us. She greeted us and then left which left us confused if we were suppose to follow her or wait and about five minutes later a manager went up to us and seemed confused as well. After the confusion we were seated.  My friend ordered the capper and lemon pasta which she absolutely loved!! However I ordered the chicken caesar salad with a margarita pizza. I asked her to place the dressing on the side however when she brought it to me it was not!! Quickly telling her and it was fixed. However her name was not memorable like her service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=20
Alicia L.,"Berkeley, CA",213,209,119,4.0,2/4/2016,"Pricey but I keep coming back! My friend and I always come here when we're shopping in the area, and we always want to share a pizza. But the pizza is so good we didn't even want to share. We ate the WHOLE pizza because it's like a work of art. Such beautiful combinations and toppings!!!  I love their California club pizza and their original BBQ chicken pizza. The California Club Pizza also makes me feel good and healthy about eating it because it has avocado and salad on it...but have no fear - they also have bacon and chicken on t too! That's why it's my favorite - you get the best of both worlds!  Another thing I love about CPK is their original hand tossed crust. I literally couldn't stop eating the crust because it was so soft and chewy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=20
Ian W.,"Emeryville, CA",1,1,1,5.0,2/9/2017,"As an Executive Chef, I tend to be over critical of restaurants, but this time I had zero complaints.This location is run like every kitchen/establishment hopes to achieve. I sat at the bar and watched the machine at work. If food was not being made,cleaning was to had. I was greeted with a smile and attentive service throughout my time there. I did not eat,but I am sure what ever I ordered would be as flawless as my overall experience.

Fins L.,"San Francisco, CA",27,236,99,1.0,1/27/2017,"Came to satisfy a friend of my daughter.  Haven't been in years, however, I did remember them to be decent back in the day.  No longer and will not ever go back.  Service- horrible, inattentive, dismissive, not trained well (if at all), dumb, no apologies for their mess ups or even realizing they messed up most of the time. It doesn't take a genius if the patron is not eating their food or making a ""this is worse than dog crap"" face.  Food- they don't even know what they are doing or how to plate, time servings, make anything look at all edible, most everything overcooked and just a waste of time to even explain how or where they went wrong.  Leftovers boxed- sent home with another tables leftovers. Gross Home- throw out another tables leftovers, tell child I'm sorry you don't have entire cheese pizza you didn't eat, run to bathroom because now you feel sick.  Crap! All this to appease an 11 year old.  Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=20
Jay G.,"Castro Valley, CA",95,267,1684,2.0,6/26/2016,After being absent from CPK for years I decided to check it out. The AMC center is very nice with a lot of shopping. Ordered the wedge and it was just ok. One tiny piece of crisp bacon was dissapointing to say the least. The lettuce was crisp and fresh but the dressing was not that great for a wedge. We ordered a mushroom pizza and while it did have a lot of mushrooms is was slightly soggy in the center of the pizza and almost cold when it was put on our table. The pizza was fairly flavorless. It's not a place I would recommend for pizza's and would order Roundtable over CPK if I had to pick a commercial chain.  I typically do not eat chain pizza. It was all very bland other than our server who had a good sense of humor. 2 stars.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=20
Carol C.,"Alameda, CA",198,884,6324,4.0,11/20/2015,"Date: 11/20/2015 Time: 12:05 PM  66°  Sunny It has been over five years since I have been to a CPK for lunch. They closed the one in SF on Van Ness Avenue, which wasn't too far from my job in the Civic Center area. It was one of my regular spots for lunch two/three times a month. It wasn't that much of the pizzas or pasta dishes that had me returning to dine at CPK. It was the Dakota Smashed Pea and Barley Soup - truly a hearty split pea soup, a good one at that to warm me up during the cold, nippy days. A cup of this soup was never enough for me, but a bowl...yes with sliced sourdough French bread...nom nom nom. Forget Campbell's canned split pea soup with ham. That canned soup ain't got nothing on the CPK's split pea soup...lol. CPK serves not only pizzas (original hand-tossed crust or crispy thin crust) but also appetizers; two different soups; salads; small plates; pastas; sandwiches; specialty items; tacos (carnitas or fish) desserts; assorted flavored iced teas, lemonades, and hot/cold beverages. They even have a children's menu. I don't dine at this CPK too often for lunch. This is my fourth time dining here in a span of 5 to 6 years. I have never experienced, encountered or received any bad and/or rude customer service from the hostess at the front area, wait staff or manager.  Today was no exception to the cordial and friendly service that my mom and family received from the employees. They were accommodating, attentive and helpful. Even the manager pitched in and made sure we were content.  Eats: Dakota Smashed Pea and Barley Soup; 1/2 orders of California Cobb Salad, Caramelized Peach Salad, Moroccan Chicken Salad; Fish tacos and Jamaican Jerk Chicken for five people. As usual, the soup is still a hit. My sisters, mom and husband all had a taste of the soup - they're hooked. Definitely there will be returned visits for my favorite soup and a piece of key lime pie or salted caramel pudding for dessert. I was too full from soup and salad to order dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=20
Nilü T.,"Berkeley, CA",171,4,,1.0,12/20/2016,"Honestly, terrible service and management (this is from multiple experiences with THIS location and multiple friends/fam experiences). Too many complaints to write... but let me just say this. The manager offered to comp our meal over this past weekend since our order was wrong/server abandoned us to say the least....  After agreeing with me about the unacceptable service we received, he offered to take care of our meal. However when the bill came it wasn't actually taken care of and he had the nerve to argue about what he actually meant...that he would only comp part of the meal. Will not be coming back for a list of reasons but this one was just comedy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=20

Rose H.,"Berkeley, CA",580,78,202,3.0,6/29/2016,"Get the BBQ chicken pizza with fresh pineapples (its an add-on) and you won't regret it. It is a pricey place, but convenient location right on top of the shops and close to movie theater. Menu is extensive and has something for everyone, and most dishes are quite good. More on the expensive side ($15 for a personal sized pizza). They will also serve you baguette and olive oil dip as appetizer along with your meal. Service was great when we stopped by, around 6pm, since it was not too busy yet. Not a spot that I would frequent but I wouldn't mind eating here if I'm catching a movie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=20
Analy C.,"Vallejo, CA",0,5,2,3.0,8/29/2017,"UPDATE ON MY LAST REVIEW : It seems CPK has some awesome customer service skills; I was contacted by someone apologizing for my last visit and offering to make it up. I appreciate it so much to see the company notices bad reviews and tries to fix it!  That's the reason why I would give the company marketing team some good scores!  I went again to this same spot using my new gift card seeing if the service got better; it wasn't as bad as last time that's for sure! Pet friendly was nice as well but the servers could bring the food out faster when the food is ready, my pasta was cold in the center of the plate of food.

Mary G.,"Oakland, CA",1,14,1,1.0,5/5/2017,"If I could give this specific location -1 star I would. I brought my mom in and sister for a nice dinner. We got a booth fairly quickly and the server was kind at the beginning, after he took our order it took 30 MINUTES and our food hadn't arrived, 30 MINUTES, I mentioned this to the server and he's like ""nah it hasn't been 30 minutes"" yes it had been, we had just made a call to my brother 30 minutes ago, so yes no thanks it's been 30 minutes+, the table before us that got there after we had ordered got their food by the time we realized it had been that long.

Ken S.,"Vacaville, CA",0,32,6,4.0,8/16/2017,"Placed a to-go order over the phone, in which the order taker was very polite, and very kind. Then when I got there I had to stand awkwardly at the to-go counter until somebody felt like helping me. It looks like they don't actually have someone who's in charge of to-go orders, who ever handles it is probably just whoever happens to be available when there's someone standing there. Not a very good way to handle business.  But, the food is why I didn't give this place 3 stars. The food is top-notch; best pizza I've ever had. And the bread/oil they give with it is killer as well. It's just a shame about the service regarding to-go orders, or I'd give 5 stars no doubt. I'd still recommend though, no doubt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=20

April R.,"San Leandro, CA",1,36,11,2.0,6/19/2017,"The food was good, my waitress was awesome, but the front hostess was rude. I walked in, her and her colleagues were laughing at me.

I noticed how she treated everyone else, greeted them, smiled, asked them where they wanted to be seated. Even spoke to them and open the door for the guests coming and going. When I left she didn't say a word to me, like she did the other guest. She just continued to play on her cell phone. This incident happened Thursday    June 8, 2017 around 4:30pm.

Food - I had dumplings which were OK but one was mangled and only partially present.  Our bread had a hair in it (which didn't even elicit an apology from the server) and my partners Jambalaya pasta was supposed to have crayfish but didn't. We mentioned to the server who just retorted ""oh it's all mixed together!""   Well it wasn't.  Then the manager came over and asked how things were and we told him.  He then brought us a ""portion"" of crayfish (5) about 2 teaspoons full.   My suggestion skip the line and go elsewhere.

So we ordered the pizza which was the only thing which made this a 2 star. It was a thin crust spinach and artichoke which had some sort of garlic butter which was great.

Mark E.,"Whittier, CA",56,150,11,4.0,9/23/2016,"There are many restaurant choices in Emeryville, especially on Bay Street. I've been to this CPK a couple of times and both experiences were well above par. This review is for the most recent visit (Sept 14). The host (I didn't get his name), was very polite. There was a couple waiting and he asked me if I minded waiting. Very classy move. My waitress, Cheyenne, was terrific. I asked about the Apothic Blend and she gave me what I thought was honest feedback. I followed her advice and ordered it; it was a delicious glass of wine. I ordered the spaghetti Bolognese - it really hit the spot and paired nicely with the wine. At no point did I encounter a problem. There were many other patrons, the music was at the right level, the food tasty and flavorful, and as I mentioned, Cheyenne was terrific in making me - a solo diner - not feel stupid for dining alone.

Corinne Y.,"Emeryville, CA",0,29,,1.0,9/7/2016,"Picture yourself pushing open those doors, and feeling the cool conditioned air on your skin.  You are greeted promptly by the server, but you notice a faint smell that you can't quite put your finger on.  ""Is that Brussels sprouts roasting in the wood fired oven?"", ""A fine french cheese?"".  You begin to think it might be related to the restaurant's sewer system.  Is it intact?  You inquire about this smell shouting over the blaring music, ""Is there a sewage problem here?"" and your server cheerfully nods, ""Yes, of course!"".  You repeat yourself and get the same response.  Let's try this once more, ""Do you guys have an issue with your sewage?""  The server finally understands you and agrees that 'Yes' the smell has been noted and they are in the process of figuring it out.   Ughh...should I eat here?  Unfortunately, you do. You are ushered to a table promptly, and notice that the restaurant is only about 25% occupied.  Should I eat here?  Unfortunately, you do.   Once your final server arrives, she asks if you got menus, you say 'no' and she replies, ""Great, what can I get for you.""  You look at your dinner companion thinking, 'Did she hear me?""  and you shout over the music, ""We didn't get menus"".  She finally understands and points to menus on the table next to us saying, ""There are menus over here, were you supposed to sit here, do you want to sit here?""  We assure our server that we are pleased with where we are sitting.  We also have to remind her that we didn't get menus, so we aren't ready to order yet.  Should we eat here?  Unfortunately, we do. We ask for club soda from the bar, the 'free' stuff.  She nods smiling, ""Sure, do you want lemon or lime with that?"".  We order an entree, and as soon as the words leave our lips, she slams her pad shut and almost walks away.  ""Wait"", we say, ""We would also like to order a salad"".  She takes our complete order quickly and goes away.  It is not too late, should we eat here?  Unfortunately, we do.   Our salad arrives, and I take my first bite.  ""Hmmm?""  My dinner companion seems to enjoy it, but I taste something strange.  We narrow it down to the sun dried tomatoes.  They taste off.  This is noticeable especially because we have ordered this salad (Sun Dried Tomato and Asparagus) many times before and always enjoy it...except for today.  With that initial sewage smell still fresh in our minds, we decide to send the salad back.   Our BBQ chicken pizza arrives, the flavor is good.  We eat the whole thing. Our bill arrives and we notice our two club sodas were listed at $3.25 each.   ""Excuse me"" we ask the server, ""I think there has been a mistake"".  She looks at our bill, ""No, we charge for club soda, that's our policy"".  We reminded her about the 'free' stuff and she completely disregards those words were spoken.  Staring at us blankly, she insists that we must pay for the two club sodas that were squirted into a cup from the bar.   We ask for the manager, and she fixes the problem.  She does not fix this bad experience.

I do not know what it is about this place, but it feels like everything is cramped up and minimal space to move around. Our service was basic. The waitress was decent and checked on us occasionally, she did seem a little awkward but who isn't. I ordered the wild mushroom strozzapreti (pasta) for my meal and the coconut blossom as my (adult) beverage. I enjoyed the mushroom strozzapreti, I only wished the portion was larger and that it was a little more moist.

Christina R.,"Stockton, CA",14,11,20,4.0,1/8/2017,"The menu was all new for me. I haven't been to one in probably 5 years. I used to always get this pan-fried salmon dish with a delicious pasta and capers dish. It was mouth-watering and I was looking forward to enjoying it again after all these years. CPK closed in my hometown. Sad sad day. I guess I didn't eat there enough even if I was there practically every other week. Oh well, such is life. I settled on the ribeye.  The Fire-grilled Ribeye was served on a cutting board which I found to be a very unique and interesting presentation. I'm pleased to say that it worked well. The steak didn't move around the plate as I cut into it and the juices flowed into the reservoir outlining the board. I requested it medium as I always order my steaks. It was blackened and seasoned well. Very tasty. It came with Yukon potato fingerlings. They crispy and seasoned with sea salt and very good as well. It came with arugula salad which I asked to omit but they gave me a ceaser salad anyways which my husband ended up picking on. I'm just not into salads much.  Chicken Tequila Fettuccine: my husband dish. He said he loved it and practically licked the plate clean so that should say something.  As we walked up to the door, it looked packed and busy since there were a lot of people waiting to be seated. But we only had to wait about 10-15 minutes. Our waitress wasn't very attentive, we had to wait awhile to get the check, wait awhile for her to pick it up, and wait awhile for our card to be returned. Good thing I had good company  and a lot to talk about but we were tired and eager to get some rest. This is the only reason for the loss of a star.

I've ordered here twice in 2017 and the first time they messed up on my invoice. Ended up messing up the final billing which took almost 2 weeks to fix. The last time I ordered was in the beginning of December. The sandwiches were not up to par and forgot the grilled veggies for one of the salads. The sandwiches were pretty sad. Seemed like they ran out of bread and had to substitute. They were cut into halves but seemed like the sandwiches were cut into 1/4's which made one of the sandwiches barely without meat.  Lastly the person who delivered our order admitted to me he was a busboy and that the CPK did not have enough delivery folks.

There were about 2 hostess, both young ladies who both seemed to be uninterested in the guest, we requested to sit outside because there was seating available and it was a lovely day, she ignored us proceeded to talk to her coworker about taking a break and sat us in the back by the kitchen door.... which honestly is just a shitty seat to sit anyone especially when you want to have a conversation because there's so much traffic.  Our server was very sweet I wish I could remember his name, my grandmother ordered one of their signature drinks, it was some type of whisky with blueberries and topped of with candied ginger, it looked really good. But I just ordered a Ice tea, it took a while to get the drinks but they were busy I'll give them that. Anyways, I tried to order my lettuce cups I had it in my head that's what I was eating my I did want it done a special way, no water chestnuts, since I usually dine @ CPK and they make this happen for me I was expecting it here but apparently they can't make it that way, and my server was honest enough to let me know it wouldn't be worth it because half of the mix is water chestnuts, since I use to be a sauté chef, I completely understood kitchen prep for an item like this, so I wasn't upset I just found something else, still bummed out though.  So we ordered a mushroom flatbread, and 2 half size Cobb salads, all the food was good the only issue was it came out at different times so we weren't able to eat together & that kinda defeats the purpose of having lunch.

The last visit i had we asked the hostess if we can sit near a TV (so i can watch the Raiders game) and generously switched our booth to one that faced the televisions near the bar with no hesitation.  The food itself isn't all that great to be honest. From the kung pao spaghetti to the spaghetti bolognese, I've tried majority of their pasta dishes and found them to be either hella bland or hella salty. I know it wasn't always like this as the Kung pao speghetti used to be my favorite dish from here 10 years ago with a nice kick and flavoring now, it's salty and lack any flavor other than the salt.

Lucky for us we got there right before the lunch wave hit and was seated within 5-10 minutes.  Coming with a party of 5, they seated us in the standard 4 party table so it was quite cozy by the time all the food came out. The initial greeting was prompt and they took down our orders pretty fast. Then the waiting game began as we awaited about 30 minutes before we flagged down a waiter to ask him for house bread with the oil/herb dip. It took another 5-10 minutes before our food arrived. I get it they're super busy.  We ordered: - The original BBQ chicken pizza $15.49: though this was their signature dish it was overall just alright. The chicken was cooked well and the BBQ sauce wasn't too overpowering, but it isn't something I would crave. 3* - California Cobb Salad $16.49: pretty standard salad with the standard Cobb contents. I would definitely recommend doing dressing on the side so it's not overpowered. 3* - Sicilian thin crust pizza $16.99: my favorite of the pizzas. Good variety of meats, I enjoyed the thin crust and overall tasty, but not $17 tasty. 4* - Waldorf salad $16.29: the better of the two salads. I loved the combination of spinach, cheese, grapes, and candied walnuts. It was delicious! 4.5*  - California club pizza $16.49: very healthy, fresh ingredients, but a bit pricy for the portion size. 4* Overall, good pizza, but for the price and service I don't think I will frequent this place as much especially with better quality and value pizza shops.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville

Like, she could not fathom a bowl of leaves. She proceeded to tentatively offer me different things off the menu that I didn't want in an attempt to find the closest thing to leaves. She finally said, ""you could do the chicken Caesar salad, and I can just tell them to take everything off?""  Perfect! I'm thinking, great she's just gonna remove the cost of what it would be to have chicken, Caesar dressing, croutons etc and modify it to just charge me for lettuce..... nope. She charges me for an entire large chicken Caesar salad. Not only this, but she didn't tell me what the cost was before I swiped my card and I did it blindly thinking it would be like five dollars. I tipped her on the card and she handed me the receipt... After tip, 18 dollars FOR A BOWL OF LEAVES. Are you serious??????????? I was seriously so surprised and mad I just took me lettuce and left. I seriously couldn't. Do they seriously not have a single way to just ring up a side of lettuce?!  I have always thought CPK was overpriced but this one really upset me.

The CA club pizza was off that day- it was pretty much dough with a salad on top of it with the bacon pretty much nonexistent? But the Works Pizza was REALLY good. I am in love with their original hand tossed crust. Our server was really bubbly and tried to make conversation. I appreciated it but she was also pretty absent except to take our order and give our checks. I also ordered a pina colada which she apparently forgot to get from the bar because she served it after I got my check and asked about it. Pretty disappointing because it had already melted. :( Will come back for the good pizza, but hopefully the service is a little bit better next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=80

The BBQ chop salad with avocado keeps me coming back here but there are plenty of other dishes from unexpected food genres with a CPK spin. Kung Pow spaghetti, spring rolls, hummus platter... Etc etc they have sandwiches and tacos and of course... PIZZA. The crust on their pizza is very sweet and differentiates their style from other pizzas. I'm also pretty sure they invented the BBQ pizza and everyone else copied it. I don't even like BBQ pizza but everyone else does. My sister orders the Jamaican jerk every time.

Chad P.,"Crockett, CA",4,132,38,2.0,8/8/2015,"Just an update . It is a year later 9/16/2016 and we have not been back. I am surprised CPK management does not reach out to disappointed customers.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We have been visiting this establishment for years now. Maybe two to three times a year. I could take it or leave it since their beer selection on tap is always mediocre but the wife loves the jambalaya so I take here there when I can and we usually spend 60 to 80 bucks plus tip depending if one of the kids join us. Service is always decent and the youthful staff generally pleasant.  Unfortunately today we were seated up against a desk where the wait staff conducts business near the back end of the restaurant. Two of the employees got into a long lasting conversation that I tried to ignore but with their animated voices coming in one ear I couldn't hear what my wife was saying across the table from me. I did go there to enjoy a meal with my wife after all.  After some minutes of frustration finally asked my wife that I was struggling to hear to hold her thought while I turned and ask the two employees to please tone it down and said that that was not the place to hold a private conversation.  The first employee looked surprised as if she didn't realize the volume of their voices and kindly appoligised. The second, believe her name was Simone, copped an Excuuse Me!?!!  attitude. I told her ""if I am out of line please call the manager""  I didn't go there to be a problem, just wanted to eat lunch with the wife after a movie. She went on and on for several minutes behind my back after that telling another employer among other things that she would in fact call the manager. What a meal ruiner.  Finally my wife asked our great waitress for the manager. He came over and said ""I will take care of it and some other very nice words about how we are the reason the business is there but the date was ruined.  We have to walk past several other eating establishments to get to CPK. It is also a thirty minute drive there for us.

Wendy H.,"Manhattan, NY",904,421,361,3.0,4/29/2013,"Ok I finally get what CPK is doing with their food. They try to infuse healthy veggies and ingredients into normally unhealthy food. For example, the California club pizza has avocado, arugula, and bacon loaded onto a pizza crust. It looks like a salad on top of a pizza. Not super-flavorful, but you feel good about getting your daily veggie intake, and on your pizza no less.  And can I say, their kids menu here is superb? $5.50 for their version of Mac n cheese, which came on a large plate and had the option of adding edamame for .50. Unlike fancy restaurants which often serve kids Mac n cheese from a box, CPK gives you a meal that was actually made from non-powdered ingredients. Nice.  They even have a salad option for kids. I don't know many toddlers who will eat salad, but it's a nice gesture. At least they're consistent throughout the menu in terms of infusing ""California healthy"" ingredients into all their dishes.  The bill ended up being $72 after tax and tip for 1 appetizer, pizza, salad, pasta, and kid's Mac n cheese. Fed three adults and one toddler. Not the best value, if you ask me, but I appreciate their effort. If only we could all order of the kids menu.

So after 5 minutes, one of the hosts apologized for the inconvenience and then two staff members, one I believe to be a manager and another to be our actual server approached us and the manager goes ""have you guys been helped yet?"" and I replied ""no not yet"" and they both decided to contemplate on who was going to help us and so the server ended up taking care of us. We ordered everything, a coke, raspberry ice tea, and strawberry mango cooler for drinks and then the mushroom and spinach flatbread, Caesar salad with chicken, and a spicy chipotle chicken pizza. After waiting, our server forgot what I ordered because I noticed her not writing everything down. But again unfortunately food took about 30 minutes to come out. Luckily the food there is always good and that is why I will always come. The Chipotle pizza definitely reminded me of actual chipotle so that was good. It was hard to get ahold of our server let alone any service. Overall food was good but service was disappointing but I will still come back for the food. Let's just hope service is a little bit better next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=60
Just M.,"Berkeley, CA",0,8,1,1.0,11/2/2017,"I will NEVER eat at this filthy establishment again. When We first day down, we had to have the server wow the tables down with a CLEAN rag because clearly, it was previously cleaned with a dirty rag and the table smells like piss (we were nowhere near the restrooms). They served us disgusting non-alcoholic beverages that consisted of nothing but flavored syrup. We returned those.  Then, they served my 9 year old son a man & cheese dish that had both a piece of cardboard AND moldy cheese in it!! Later that night, the food that was already consumed made my pregnant friend and I violently ill. I spoke a manager, Frederico  the next day who promised me a refund for the remainder of the bill (the two meals that made my friend & I sick). Almost a week later,  I inquired AGAIN. Frederico advised out would come the next day. Three days later STILL nothing,  and another manager, Porfirio, tells me that he can't call Corporate because Frederico isn't in!  Huh?? They have the SAME TITLE. He says to call back tomorrow when Frederico is there or when Carol the GM is in. I surely will AND will be phoning corporate myself.

Our waiter was very accommodating and came to check in with us at the right times, We never had to flag him down to order or ask questions about the menu. He even told us about the California pizza dough club which is a rewards program for CPK. We signed up and received a free small plate. We got the chicken quesadilla the sauce for it was really good and had a kick to it.  My best friend and I were seated right away in a large booth and we were both pretty excited because we came in specifically for their thai crunch salad. But we ended up ordering half a thai crunch, California club pizza, and two unlimited refills of flavored iced tea.  The salad was delicious as usual, there is so many components to the salad that it is hard to recreate, making it worth trying at CPK. The pizza was fresh and good it was kinda hard to eat at first because most of the stuff kept coming out but we eventually got the hang of it. The Iced teas was sweetened and had distinct flavors of mango and raspberry. The peach one was kinda diluted for my taste but still delicious compared to starbucks' overpriced iced tazo teas.  In the end we felt full but not bloated, we both agreed to tip very generously but later found out that the waiters and waitresses split the tips.

The location itself is beautiful especially at night with the accent lighting and vibes. My family and I had driven yesterday evening from LA, so we were looking forward to sitting down and having a nice meal; of course, we went with cpk because it's always good.  The hosts were kind and accommodating. But our waitress was something else. I understand the stresses of being a waitress because I have been one before, especially with a full house and a million things to do at once. This girl was clearly distracted the whole time. We ordered our peach ice teas- served warm and with a faint sweetness. I needed to flag the waitress's down to get refills.  On one occasion I kept looking for her and she was sitting outside ""cleaning"" the little drink booklets while she  looked around and went on to text on her phone (she even stared back at me while I was looking at her and that didn't give her the hint that I might have needed something). I have to clarify my family and myself are not arrogant by any means, we are polite and never treat waiters unfairly, however  I was beyond frustrated with her service.  The bolognese pasta lacked flavor from the usual times we had ordered this before. The caesar salad lacked dressing and you could tell wasn't mixed properly. Usually waiters offer crushed pepper over your salad and none was offered. Near the end,  I asked for a dessert and the bill.  About 15 minutes later she hands me the bill and I asked her if the dessert was coming and she said ""oh yeah I leave that until the end"". Finally she places it on the table, clearly over her day, and walks away without a word.

Angela M.,"San Leandro, CA",1356,433,152,3.0,7/27/2012,"CPK was better than I was expecting it to be. I ordered the margherita pizza and, while it was the size of a medium sized plate, it really was just enough for one person, perhaps two if you're both not feeling too hungry. The pizza was really good, with a very thin crust that was crispy at the edges, but I was hoping it would've have whole tomatoes instead of just tomato sauce, cheese, and basil. Really the only thing that made it a ""margherita"" was the basil. Prices are a bit much, considering the size of the pizzas (almost $13 for essentially a personal pizza), but I guess you can feel ok about it, considering the fact that the pizza is tasty...  The menu is pretty extensive here. There are many different ""artisan"" pizzas here (that description always makes me laugh a little), salads, pastas, and starters, so there's more than likely going to be something for everyone. Someone in a another review said this is a good place to come if you're not in a hurry - he's right. Considering that we had five different pizzas coming to our table, I don't really blame the wait, and it was great that they brought out everything at the same time, but yeah, it's going to be a bit of a wait for your food here. Our waitress was also pretty much MIA the entire meal. Not that we needed her to come around, but it's always nice to know your table hasn't been forgotten. We also had to sit and wait for a while after we'd eaten, for her to come around and ask if we were finished. I will give her a lot of credit for being pretty cool at the end - we wanted to split the bill five ways (yeah, we were that annoying group in the restaurant that day that has to pull some complicated crap), but she did it for us with a great attitude.  Overall, I'd come here again to try some of the other offerings on the menu, but it's not a place I'd go out of my way to make a visit to. It's worth a try if you're in the area though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=160

Matt Y.,"Lahaina, HI",198,383,2248,4.0,12/1/2012,"12/1/12 Lunch I rarely dine at chain restaurants and I don't know how to review them, partly because they seem to have the same offerings and lack individuality. That said, I have eaten at two CPK locations within the past 30 days. First at the Fashion Mall in Las Vegas, right before heading out to the airport to catch the homeward-bound flight and today at the Bay Street location. For a chain, CPK at Bay Street shall put some of the local restaurants in shame. Despite a bit of a confusion at seating, we received wonderful service the minute we walked into the restaurant. Until recently, I was in a deception that CPK only served pizzas. I avoided going because I'm gluten-free. Obviously CPK is way more than just pizzas. We had: Chicken lettuce wrap BBQ Chicken Pizza Waldorf Salad (half portion) The chicken lettuce wrap with ginger soy sauce is delicious. It might not taste like the ones I had at home but good enough. A welcoming alternative to the usual spinach artichoke dip if you like Asian-fusion. My bf had the BBQ Chicken Pizza, one of their hand-tossed pizzas and was tasty, with plenty of basil. My Waldorf Salad has generous portion of candied walnuts and apples. Chicken is grilled but not dry, and the mustard vinaigrette is perfectly flavored. The bartender nailed the Grey Goose cosmopolitan. They key is fresh lime. It came in a 6-oz martini glass, pink, and with pulps---all that I look for in a great cosmo. For $10.50 this cosmo rocks. Service is friendly and efficient. Food is above average for chain.

They give you 10 pizzas (any flavor from their regular pizza menu), 2 salads (bbq chopped salad, caesar or mixed greens) and a tray of cookies (chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin & snickerdooodle). My coworker said the snickerdoodle was too sweet. The Works pizza is just your standard combo pizza. Everybody liked the Thai Chicken and Chipotle Chicken pizzas. The White Pizza was quite salty. I'm glad we didn't add bacon to it because it probably would have made it even saltier. We were pretty bummed that the Garlic Chicken was discontinued.  That was their best flavor! Don't get me wrong. Their pizzas were pretty good. I ate 5 slices (which means I have to punish myself with a 7 mile run tonight). But my standards for pizza were set high by Tony's Pizza and I am still in love with Round Table (I have no clue why I'm crazy about the Round Table crust and sauce).  We had problems with their online ordering system and it was too slow.  I know for a fact it wasn't due to our connection because I tested a different website to see if it loaded slow. The ordering system didn't even send me a confirmation so we decided to call it in just to be sure.  The CPK employee said they never got our online order. Aside from those minuses, the customer service was great. They packed our big order neatly. They kept the cold salad goods away from the hot pizzas so that the salad won't wilt. They even kept the chicken separate from the Caesar salad because the chicken was hot. They also kept the dressings in these nice squeeze containers that you can reuse for your own condiments.

TO THE RUDE MANAGER: I HOPE YOU READ THIS AND REALLY HOPE YOU CONSIDER BEING NICER AT THE WAY YOU COME AT SITUATIONS. No we do not want you to give my TWO year old niece gold fishes or bread to ""calm her down"" when she was just being a happy child. Not a family restaurant, I guess. You're extremely lucky that you weren't put on the spot for being such an a**hole.  So moral of the story is that I DO NOT recommend this place AT ALL.

I they review the tapes of the incident they will see an unknown lady coming from outside and giving the same tall manager a cake or something to keep in their cld storage as a favor. Highly irregular n my opinion. Opens up the place to charges of favoritism and contamination. I now think the ushers/manager just favor friends and give them your seats as you wait unaware. T   We really go to CPK often. But this location is the worst American chain restaurant we have ever seen. Most of the staff is from Oakland area and are very rude and clearly untrustworthy. Watch your food. We were sitting less than 5 feet away waiting eagerly for our name to be called and I discovered they had scratched it off already. When I asked, the black lady casually implied that it was somehow my fault because  someone ""claimed your name and we seated them"".  I asked ""if you had called our names out clearly, how could we miss it from 5 feet away if not less?"" No reply and worse: she offered no solution either, like ""sorry let me find you a table next""...The manager, the only white guy seemed nice, and seated us. But the staff seemed to now want to teach us a lesson and the drinks refused to show up despite reminders, for over 30 minutes. After I spoke to the manager (again) and said this is our second bad experience at this very location in a month and I will leave, he simply said ""Well. in that case have a nice day"" and turned to his computer screen again.

I told him we had done this several times and he said they used to but changed their policy after some bad experiences.   This sounds like a bull shit excuse and we were pretty upset after walking nearly 2 miles to have a family dinner/outing and to be brushed off in such an unprofessional manner.  Whatever they want to say, they just lost A TON of business, since we were doing this quite often (many times with alcohol).  But the pasta place 20 feet away was more than happy to have us, furry children and all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=220

When my Jambalaya finally came it was okay... it tasted decent but its not something I would order again.  The server was extremely apologetic for the long wait.

Our bill only came to $18 dollars when it should have been nearly $50.  Plus they gave us a coupon to get free entrees and drinks on our next visit.

We were seated quickly and they brought us the menu(the waitress said it was new menus) and water quickly. After about 10 minutes we ordered the bbq chicken pizza, The works and grilled chicken caesar salad sandwich on the herbed onion focaccia. Bbq chicken pizza:  it was about 13 inchs in diameter and had cubes of grilled chicken and red oinon on top with bbq sauce under the layer of mozarella cheese. I admit it was pretty good because it was fresh and not too drench in sauce. What my problem was is that for some reason some parts of my pizza were cold compare to the rest of my melting cheesy gooey hot pizza. The Works: The works was the combination pizza. it had mozzarella cheese pepperoni, sausages, bell pepper, mushroom and onion. It was flavorful with the thin layer of tomato sauce. Not too much oily either. The Grilled Chicken Caesar sandwich: the grilled chicken on this sandwich was delicious but not much seasoning. it had a thin layer of mayo and tomato and ice berg lettuce all in between the herb onion focaccia bread. The bread was lightly toasted and served with soup. I ordered the tortilla soup. It was very thick and creamy but not very good. The bread of the sandwich seemed a bit doughy for me too. Pumpkin Cheesecake: The cheesecake came in a really big slice and not bad as for as taste. It was very pumpkin pie tasting with the cream cheese mixed into it. My friends enjoyed it and so did i. Service was good. Our server was super busy and actually had to switch off to different server. Also we have to ask for bread instead of them just serving it to us.

Anu P.,"Philadelphia, PA",476,345,182,3.0,4/1/2013,"I've been here a dozen times and not going to lie, service here is pretty shitty. Either our waiter forgets our bread, we're seated much later than the expected wait time, or our food just does not come out for a long time. Unfortunately, I love this place because the food is always yummy (my all time favorites are the roasted vegetable salad and the wild mushroom pizza).  However, no matter how busy or NOT busy this place is, typically something goes wrong. For example, during my visit yesterday I put my name on the list to be seated and was told it would be 10-15 minutes from the young lady upfront. I went to use the restroom while my friend waited near the front. When I come back, I see two other parties being seated before me (both parties of 2) who had come in right after we put our name down. I assumed maybe they had already come in earlier but were checking back in. Then after about 5 more minutes the same lady asks me if I had put my name down...I was so upset! Not only did she forget who we were after literally 10 minutes, but she claims that she already called my name. While I was in the bathroom, if she calls my name like she claims she should've asked around with the parties already waiting in the area instead of just moving on. Furthermore, does she think I'm just sitting around for no reason in a restaurant? NO! I put my name down and if your waitresses are incompetent to the point that they can't remember someone's face from 10 minutes ago, that's an issue. And it wasn't even crowded...that's not even the end of it though. After she apologizes and seats us, our server doesn't come over for 15 minutes. I have to call two separate waiters after finally our real server comes to our table. Turns out the lady who seated us from the front didn't think to tell our server that she had seated a table that he had to serve...seriously? Service after that point was breezy. But with the amount of waiting I had done that day, a restaurant should have offered some sort of discount or at least a better apology!

Tonight, I split the BBQ chicken chopped salad and Thai chicken pizza w/a friend. Both were delicious! I especially liked the salad. The dressing was some off-shoot of ranch (super tasty!)  and I love that there's corn in it! The Thai pizza was good too. Who would of thought that peanut sauce, cheese, & bean sprouts could come together to make such a yummy pizza?  Props to the individual who came up with this combination!

When she came back to the table to collect our plates and give us the check, we asked her about it and she said she did not put the order in. Her demeanor was very calm and it seemed as if she did that intentionally. I was shocked that she didn't apologize for that and even had the audacity to make a statement saying that's ""plenty of food"" for us eat.

Right now they have a seasonal one with brussel sprouts and bacon! Aside from pizza I really like the bbq chicken and thai crunch salads.

We went on Halloween and it was about a 10-15 min wait as expected. We were seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant around 6:20 . We waited about another 10-15 min until our waitress, Misty came and greeted us. As she came up she seemed a little flustered like she's been running around, as seen. Right there on the spot she asked if we were ready to order and so we did. 20mins has passed we didn't receive our drinks another couple that was seated shortly after us ended up leaving. Another 10mins pass, she comes up to us asking if we've seen a $100 bill and she didn't even explain, or apologize why she hasn't brought our drinks until we said something. She apologized like she didn't know what was going on.  5 mins later she brings out our water and bread. It was past 7 and finally received our food while other people around us who were seated after got their food before us. As she brought our entrees out I was wondering why we didn't receive out appetizers first. I mean it is called an appetizer for a reason. As she brought out entrees out she apologized and wondered why our appetizer didn't come out, I was wondering the same thing. At this point my boyfriend and I were irritated after waiting quite some time and we were in such a time crunch(we were going to watch a movie). I got the creamy garlic pasta w chicken for the most part it does not own up to its name, it was not creamy what so ever. My boyfriend got the bbq chicken pizza and it was so and so. While we were eating Misty came and checked on us and saw that we had drinken all our water and asked if we wanted more and I said yes. 10 mins pass, no water and she comes and checks up on us after we finished out food and asked if we wanted more water and I was just so frustrated at this point where I just wanted the check and to leave. She gave us the  check right away and guess what she charged us for two pizza instead of one.

The pizza prices are cool cuz you can split it between two people, but anything else on the menu is ridiculously overpriced. Because I already had pizza 3 days in a row (yeah...), I wanted to get something other than pizza. I wanted to try their pasta options because my friend told me they were good, but I was in the mood for meat like chicken or shrimp and almost all the pasta didn't come with chicken - you could get it with chicken for an extra $3, or with shrimp for an extra $4.50, but I wasn't trying to pay no $15 for pasta from California Pizza Kitchen of all places. If I'm gonna pay more than $11.50 for pasta, that shit better be from a good ass place known for their pasta, shoot. So I decided to opt for their cobb half salad ($10.69) while my friend was less cheap and got their garlic fettuccine with mushrooms ($12.95). My salad was ok, but definitely not worth the $10.69 I paid - I've had way better salads at Trader Joe's for less than $5.

As to the food.... It's good quality and ""handsome"" but without edge.  It's middle of the road pizza that could be great pizza.  I imagine that the early California Pizza Kitchens had outstanding food. ...Before it went corporate and those masterpiece pizzas became ""pizza by the numbers"" ersatz products.   Unless you've just awoken from a coma and would eat your blue hospital booties and cannot get to Zachary's (for the Caesars salad, if nothing else) you will not have an inspirational pizza at (this) California Pizza Kitchen.   For pizza lovers (like BBQ, bagels and lovers of ethnic foods) searching for the real deal,  more than three stars would mean this is not worth your while.   My commendation here is for Eric/Erik, our server who was, actually, exceptional.

I guess that's one solace for the waiting parties in the Bay Street mall, you can go shop. We planned our orders since we had so much time to think. We ordered two pastas, two pizzas, and a salad. I ordered the Jambalaya, which was a favorite on their menu. It was noted with a little palm tree next to item. I originally wanted to try the chimichurri chicken dish, but asked the waiter what that was. His response was, ""chimichurri is with chimichurri sauce"". I asked him to elaborate. He said, ""it's sort of green"". As you can tell, I didn't go for it. I thought he would try to explain the flavor or ingredients involved. I did not want to get smart with him on a rainy day. Plus I love jambalaya. The pizzas came, then the pastas, and lastly the salad. What a reversal of events.  There's nothing special about the food here, except it's not bad.

Le Thuy Hang D.,"Oakland, CA",45,37,5,4.0,9/11/2012,"I wasn't too sure about CPK when I saw the reviews on here.  I went here for a friend's birthday yesterday and our waitress was really nice. We ordered Garlic Cream Fettuccine, Chicken Tequila Fettuccine, Hawaiin BBQ w/ chicken pizza to share and the birthday boy got a peach lemonade (free refills, holla!). The food didn't take too long to come. The pizza... I liked. I mean, it's good when you first bite into but if you eat like 2-3 slices then it kind of becomes overwhelming, I guess. The worst dish by far was the Garlic Cream Fettuccine. It had no taste of garlic what-so-ever :\. So that's what the -1 star is for. The BEST dish was the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine. Oh my GOD, it was AMAZING!! When it first came out, it didn't look too appetizing because they used green (spinach?) fettuccine, but when you bite into it.. it's.. heaven. Spicy heaven. After that the waitress came out and handed the birthday guy a free icecream scoop w/ a lighted candle! She was so sweet for that. Don't know about others, but my experience w/ this place was great. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=280
Dusty N.,"Emeryville, CA",21,219,13,3.0,12/27/2013,"We walked in and the hostess turned her back to take a personal phone call. We literally stood there for a few minutes while she giggled it up with her friend on the other line and texted on her cell at the same time. So unprofessional and rude but she couldn't have been more than 16 years old.  We had researched the menu online before coming up here and found out they had a gluten free menu (my friend is celiac) so we asked her for one when she was finally done with her phone call. She looked at us like we were crazy and told us they didn't have a gluten free menu. I told her that it was online and she said she would have to go ask the manager and get back to us. Thankfully our waitress knew what was up and gave us the menu right away. I think that hostess needs to find a new job cause she really sucks at this one.  Food is decent; I had a pepperoni pizza and lettuce wraps. My friend had the gluten free pepperoni pizza and she really liked it too. The service is excellent but I have to take off a couple stars cause I noticed something very disturbing. All the tables have small appetizer plates sitting on them when you walk in. The table next to us had one guy come in and sit at a booth by himself that had 4 plates on it. He only used one but when he left, the busser didn't clear off those other plates. He cleaned the table and re-set those plates on the table for the next guests to use. Now, I've been in the hospitality business since i was a teenager and the #1 rule is that if a dish touches a table, no matter if it's been used or not, you take it back to the kitchen to get washed. It doesn't matter if it even looks clean or looks like nothing got on it, you still have to remove all dishes from the table to go get washed and sanitized. I was seriously grossed out, especially when a family of 3 came right in and sat down at that table. I sure hope they didn't end up needing to use those plates!!!! Managers - please retrain your bussers and wait staff on the proper protocol for cleaning off tables!!! And hire a new hostess!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=280

I called in a couple days early for a reservation and the lady that was on the phone was like ""We don't do reservations.. we do wait-list""  So I kindly said Oh can I be placed on the wait-list?  She asked ""Okay, How many?"" I said 15.  Then she said ""okay bye"" I was like Wait! Aren't you going to ask me When and What's my name? Then she was like (annoyed voice) ""Oh yeah what is it?"" after she got my name she said I have someone else on the other line Goodbye. RUDE! I was actually making a reservation for my 22nd birthday and I never celebrated at a restaurant before so don't mind my ""noobness"". But it was really disrespectful since I was speaking to her like an adult. Since I knew that there was something fishy with my ""wait-list"" I came early to check in. And the servers in the front said that my ""wait-list"" was never recorded. And the manager came out trying to help me, she then dug through the trashcan and found my information there. She apologize and said the wait will be 45 minutes. I said forget it and went to Pasta Pomorodo instead. They made a table of 15 in like 10 minutes with a cute waiter also.

We order our food. Waited about 10 minutes to get our food. No big deal. Our waiter walked passed our table about 6 times, and never asked us once if we needed anything! But she kept going and asking the two tables near us if they needed anything. She never cleaned up or table, got no refills of drinks, did not ask if we wanted dessert, NOTHING! Our server was CHANTEL, WHITE GIRL WITH GAGES, AVOID! When I finally got her to get us dessert and drinks, she spilled lemonade all over the chair and floor refilling it fast and with an attitude. We asked for water three times, and only got one cup of water. This was by far the WORST SERVICE, EVER! Made me NEVER want to go to this place again, dumb waiter. I ended up talking to the manager after I paid and he provided 2 free vouchers for food, and told me I should have told him before I paid. Well now I know!

As you just read above, I gave this place 3 stars because of the staff. I don't remember whoever our waiter's name was, but he was pretty rude. After seating us at our table and practically throwing the menus at us, he told us that he will be right back to take our orders. No mention of drinks at all. I want to say it was about 15-20 minutes later before he came back to check on us and see what we wanted to order. Of course we weren't going to let him get away for another long period of time without making sure we told him everything we wanted. This time, he brought us our drinks pretty promptly, then we sat there waiting for the pizza. Just waiting, and waiting, and waiting.... Probably 30 minutes later, our food finally came out, buffalo chicken thin crusted pizza, a hawaiian one, and spaghetti. All the food was delicious.  I especially liked the buffalo chicken because the buffalo sauce made it a little spicy. The spaghetti was also pretty good. Our waiter, however, never came back to check on us and only made one last appearance to give us our check. Wait, let me rephrase that, throw us the check. Wow. How nice of him. Obviously, we were not impressed with his stills as a waiter so we didn't feel bad at all tipping him only $1. But who is he to complain?

Jo-Ann D.,"Berkeley, CA",83,3,5,1.0,3/23/2013,"So we've all had our fair share of bad service. And everyone has a bad day. But tonight has really given me a reason to really support small businesses. CPK is a restaurant that my boyfriend and I go to every once in a while so I didn't expect tonight to be any different from our previous experiences but I was so wrong. From the start the service was terrible. We told the host how many was in our party and we knew we would have to wait. We decided to have drink at the bar until our name was called. 30 minutes later we noticed that people who came in were getting seated before us. When my bf asked how much longer the wait was, the hostess stated ""you're getting there."" So we pointed out that people were getting seated and they were able to find a table right then and there. Where we were seated there were PLENTY of small tables that we could have sat down to in the same station.  When we got seated our waitress took our order and offered us bread. WE NEVER GOT BREAD. WE NEVER GOT WATER. When our food came out the runner didn't offer us any cheese or pepper or any other condiments. Our waitress never came to check on our order or us even though she walked by our table and saw me looking at her. The pasta was finished before the water came. She FINALLY came with water as my boyfriend went to look for the manager. I pointed out all the inefficiencies and she simply shrugged her shoulders and said ""Sorry."" So my bf brought back the manager and we explained the situation.  THIS IS WHAT MADE MY ENTIRE VIEW OF CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN AND CHAIN RESTAURANT CHANGE. I AM SO LIVID I HAVE TO CAPS LOCK THIS. WHEN WE SPOKE TO THE MANAGER AND POINTED OUT ALL THE INEFFICIENCIES HE HAD THE NERVE TO ASK MY BOYFRIEND IF HE WORKS. HE SAID THAT HE'S BEEN BUSTING HIS ASS FOR 8 HOURS AND THEY'RE HAVING A BAD WORK DAY. HE THEN OFFERED TO PAY FOR OUR BILL AND WASH OUR CAR. HOW INAPPROPRIATE AND UNPROFESSIONAL CAN A MAN BE! ASKING ABOUT OUR PERSONAL LIFE AND TRYING TO ""SOLVE"" THE SITUATION BY BEING SARCASTIC AND OFFERING TO WASH OUR CAR. HE IS DISGUSTING. HIS SERVICE WAS APPALLING. THE WAIT STAFF WAS ABSOLUTELY INEFFICIENT. AND I THINK THIS IS BECAUSE THEIR ""FEARLESS"" LEADER DOES NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BEING A MANAGER. I AM STILL FUMING FROM HIS ACTIONS.

Suzette N.,"Oakland, CA",2,17,,5.0,7/16/2012,"This review starts off pretty bad but you have to get to the bottom to know why I gave them 5 stars: There were quite a few issues with the food when it was brought out to our table on Friday, 29JUN12, if it was brought out to the table at all. The crispy mac 'n' cheese starters came out at room temperature, which left a lot to be desired. The pizza we ordered inadvertently made its way to another guest's table, while the cedar plank salmon came out very well done, more than any salmon connoisseur would appreciate. When this was brought to the attention of our server (her name escapes my mind) the young lady immediately informed the manager, Mr. Waylen Williams, and he quickly approached our table. Mr. Williams was extremely apologetic and very sincere in his acknowledgement of all of our concerns, specifically the unacceptability of the food as it both had and had not been presented to us. Mr. Williams immediately attempted to rectify the situation. Not only did Mr. Williams follow-up on the missing food item and overcooked salmon but when he returned to our table Mr. Williams agreed to comp the entire dinner (my food had arrived to the table flawlessly) while also offering us the opportunity to return to CPK for a free dinner. The latter was totally unexpected but very much appreciated and showed us that Mr. Williams was generally concerned with making sure CPK remained one of our favorite eateries, minus this unfortunate occurrence. Not only is Mr. Williams proficient in customer service but he gets kudos for customer retention! Eating out is something that we do often and customer service is extremely important in defining the dining experience. With all the issues that were experienced that evening, all that negativity was overshadowed by Mr. Williams' professional demeanor and his heartfelt apologies for our unfortunate experiences that particular evening. We will definitely return to CPK Emeryville, not only because we have free meal coupons, but because of Mr. Williams deep appreciation for exceptional customer service and retention.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=340

I am impressed that they revamp the entrees in the menu and constantly challenge customer to try them :)  If i have to pick one entree from every section i would say winners are strawberry lemonade, cream of asparagus soup, miso salad, vegetarian sandwich and BBQ shrimp pizza. However i also recommend to be creative and adventurous. You got nothing to loose as they will gladly replace your food if u are unsatisfied :)  Like P.F chang i have been struggling to get good service in this restaurant hence the 3 stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=380
Emily R.,"Manhattan, NY",6,23,,1.0,5/29/2009,The rating is primarily for the service but also the food. My friend and I ordered the Thai Linguine and a Margherita Pizza. I have to give props to the waiter. He was super friendly and accommodating. We got our food and I started with the pizza. The pizza was ok. Nothing to write home about but not terrible. My friend took one bite of the pasta and gave me a look. I tried it and it was beyond salty. I am not a particularly picky eater. And I never send back food but it was seriously not edible. The waiter brought back another dish of it. My friend took another bite and gave me another look. I tried and it and it was better but still really salty.  The waiter sent out the manager and he told us that the pasta was made correctly and that apparently our taste buds were off.  The waiter offered us dessert and said he would have the manager give it to us on the house for the bad dish. Needless to say the manager did not want to do that.  The whole experience was terrible.  The food = mediocre. The manager = condescending. The only plus was the waiter. He deserves the one star.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=380

The menu is bulging with choices & it totally reminds me of all that is California! Like, totally.  It was confusing; it had no real culture and borrowed from other cultures  to complete itself.  My workbuddy considered the 'Chinese' lettuce wraps, till she heard they added mushrooms to their mix, so she opted for the 'Thai' chicken salad. OK what the fuck?  Chinese & Thai salads, soups and even pizzas? On top of that, they dabble in Mexican food. Oh and for dessert, a good old fashioned 'Southern' red velvet cake.  Nothing originated from California on the menu, but it gave me plenty of options so, I can't complain, but I had to comment. My Cobb salad was fresh & delicious, but the service kind of sucked (meek waitress). Ohhh CPK, you can't tell if you want to sell Thai, Chinese, Southern or Spanish food and I can't hate you because of that. I like the little melting pot going on in the menu.

Okay, how do you run out of bread? Whatever.  I think CPK should just serve bread with the pasta dishes just because the portions are so small and cost so much.

Damon Z.,"South San Francisco, CA",21,149,2,4.0,5/17/2011,"Normally, I tend to stay away from chain dining establishments, simply because there's so many non-chain establishments in the Bay Area for me to enjoy. However, every now and then, I do crave CPK. Thankfully, there is one close to home.  It was a Sunday afternoon, after a cross country flight. I'd just gotten home, and my friend asks, where do I want to eat. Definitely something filling, as I hadn't eaten in many house, so I though of pizza. CPK was the closest place in mind, so we dashed over. Our server was bubbly, and friendly, and checked on us often. A very good thing for a hungry man, who was just on the airplane for 6 hours, dealing with cranky passengers. So, why do I come to CPK? Well, besides their huge amount of choices on the menu, I love the fact that I can get any of their pizzas on a thin crust. While I do enjoy pizza, I don't like the feeling of being weighed down afterward. My favorite on their menu is pear and gorgonzola. It's got the wonderful combination of sweet and savory, and it is served with fresh arugula on to satisfy the old maternal dictation of having greens on your plate! There is also a Sicilian pizza, which I turn to, when I want meat. It's got a lovely hint of spiciness to it, to compliment the saltiness of the meat.  CPK is nothing new to me. I've been to it several times since they first came into being, but my recent trip to the Emeryville CPK was a reminder of how much I do enjoy their product.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=380

Last weekend we went there for dinner with my husband. No smile at the frontdesk but lots of smiles from our waitress D.. Good food as usual, though the service was a little slow. My husband finished his glass of water with his entree and never got it refilled... You will never get more than a 15% tip with him if you don't refill his water. That's sort of a basic service thing... I ordered a strawberry colada which had the consistency of  a smoothie, and that is fine, but then you should provide your customers with a larger straw because it was really difficult to drink that with the tiny regular straw. It was sort of difficult to get the attention of our waitress. She was smiley when with us but she never came to check in on our food and was taking a lot of time between each course. The reason for my update is not the straw though, or even the slow service. It is the bill. When it came it said $38 and I put my card in. The waitress came back and I was ready to write in the tip when my husband notices that there was a mistake: it was now saying the bill was $33. Even if the service was so-and-so that night, I did not want to rob you guys, so I told the waitress that it was not the right amount as it should be more. She took it, talked about it with a man who seemed to be a manager and brought the check back at $38 and said ""sorry about that"". I was quite surprised that she said SORRY and not ""THANK YOU for your honesty"". Seriously, I doubt half of your customers would have let the waitress know about the mistake being in their advantage. I am not even going as far as saying you should have left the bill as $33 (though it would have been a nice gesture and inexpensive for you to do), but not receiving even a THANK YOU was VERY disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=360

Hopefully no real jerk sauce was used when making it LOL.  Anyway, it's ok food for being drunk or on a date with someone; as there were that night i went out.

I've been here before, and normally I'm a CPK fan, I don't love it, but I don't loathe it either.  Unfortunately this time our waitress was horrible, I feel bad saying that,  but she really was.  It wasn't busy but she took her sweet ass time with everything...taking orders...bringing food...giving the bill...etc.  So we order and I ended up splitting the avocado egg rolls (meh.) and the garlic chicken pizza (delicious.).  Luckily a few people in our party got the spinach artichoke dip which is heavenly, and almost saved CPK for me, but you know in the words of JoJo it was ""just too little too late."" So our waitress is re-filling my water and she spills on my egg rolls!  She sees it happen, and then she looks at me and walks away.  WTF!  I was not happy, my boyfriend ate it, no problem but I was not about to eat a soggy egg roll...gross...  Also, another girl in our party asked for no mushrooms in her pasta and literally the waitress was like: ""You want extra chicken?""...come on!

I finished my Mango-Lemonade about the time food came out.  The waiter came by once to refill our drinks, and that was only within the first 10 minutes of being seated there...so really no one at our table got a refill.  We were so hungry from waiting for so long to give our order and our order to come out that we scarfed down our food and the drink didn't matter anymore. We originally chose CPK beause we had these ""Do Not Open"" Coupons that could only be opened by the manager on our next visit.  We were very stoked on using whatever discounts we got on our meal this day (the minimum is 10% off).  However, because it was my birthday, the non-existent waiter finally showed up and gave me A FREE SUNDAE! joy!!   Then he said ""I saw your Coupons but figured you guys would much rather have a free birthday sundae...so you guys can open up your coupons on your NEXT VISIT"".  Huh??? Why can't we open up our coupons now. ""Well, because we can only do ONE promotion at a time, you either get a free sundae or you get to open the coupons.""  Well I'm no math whiz but a minimum of 10% off a bill of $150 is still $15 off.  I told him we wanted to use the coupon, and we didn't order the sundae.  ""Yes, the sundae is complimentary on your birthday. You don't need to order it.""  EXACTLY. COMPLIMENTARY.

Boo. Driving home, I realized that Bay Street has a lot of restaurants, and figured I'd duck in and grab some take-out. Saw the sign for CPK, remembered that my boyfriend loves that place, so thought I would make a nice gesture. Walked in behind a gaggle of squawking sorority sisters with bad peroxide dye jobs and press-on nails. Apparently they've never ordered take-out in a restaurant, and were speaking to the girl behind the counter as though they were Barbara Walters conducting an interview. Multiple questions about EVERY item on the menu. ""What's on this salad?"" ""Can I get this crust on this pizza?"" ""What's the difference between X and Y?"" Seriously, if they were playing ""The View"" on a big screen TV, this would have been a sneak preview into what hell must be like. Now, I don't fault the restaurant's employees for tacky customers... but after five minutes of indecisiveness and blathering on, seeing a customer with a VERY decisive look on his face and a menu in hand standing behind this mess, you'd think that they would actually wave me in to drop an order and run. But no, I stood there for ten minutes while they instructed the sisters about (wait for it), their new scratch-off instant-win game. So FINALLY I place my order, she takes it, walks away without saying a word. I stand there until she returns, and ask, ""Um, about how long?""

After spending much time coming up with a doable and appealing combo, my friend and I settled on half veggie w/ japanese eggplant and half 'the works' (without the pepperoni) pizza. We also got the tuscan hummus appetizer. I guess it makes sense, but I was disappointed that they didn't give us complimentary bread because we ordered the appetizer. The actual food was alright, but nothing special. The pita-like bread in the appetizer was warm and fluffy, the hummus tasted simply good, and nothing more. I probably could've made pizza like we had if I had the ingredients. We each ate three slices of pizza to finish off the plate--I bet a hungry individual could finish off the whole thing, though. Total bill plus tip ended up being ~$13 per person. We asked to sit on the patio in the beginning, but the hostess said that they 'had no servers outside.' Oh well.

Twenty minutes later he came over and said that they did not have segrams seven- i was flustered and said ""any whisky is fine.""  We asked for three greek pizzas and cancelled on to change it outt for a shrimp scampi- I was charged all 4 pizzas.

April Z.,"San Francisco, CA",17,74,5,3.0,6/8/2009,"The food is okay good, but that's to be expected of a chain / semi-fast food restaurant. When you are hungry, the pizzas and pastas taste much better! My favorite dish is their Seafood Salad, with crab meat - good stuff. :) The service is kind of slow. It's obvious that the restaurant has open tables inside, yet there's still a long line/crowd of people waiting around near the entrance. Generally, the waiters are nice, but just not very attentive. Asking for things like utensils, water, more plates, condiments, or the bill usually take a while.  The most recent time we went, our waitress was probably new, because she spilled a glass of ice water on our table (and got some on us), knocked a plate onto a glass counter next to us, poured ice water into a Sprite glass, and threw a straw onto someone's plate (by accident.) But at least she was nice! And it was just kind of funny, not up to the point of annoying.

Our glasses were never more than 1/2 full without a refill on the way. Our food arrived really fast and tasted great. My friends really enjoyed the Mexican pizza...whatever it's called. They also had the egg roll appetizer that they seemed to enjoy also. I had a simple pepperoni pizza, which is great in it's simplicity.

Tony L.,"San Francisco, CA",664,1265,21,3.0,11/2/2007,"I think I agree with Jon L.'s review of this place.  Reading over some of the negative reviews, it seems that a) some people love to embellish their bad experiences and b) a lot of people don't ""get"" CPK.  Just because you're not used to seeing something different on a pizza menu, it doesn't automatically classify it as bad. The idea for California Pizza Kitchen is to take untraditional ingredients and to use them on a traditional dish, in this case, it's Pizza.  This isn't New York thin crust or Chicago deep dish, they've got different toppings here, everything from mango to curry to avocado.  So if you're in the mood for something different, this is definitely your ticket. I came here with a friend today.  He had a club sandwich and I had the jerk chicken pizza.  We also split an appetizer, egg rolls with avocado, bacon, and a few other things in there.  The quality was what you'd expect from a chain, its manufactured tasty.  This is not always a bad thing.  My pizza was also pretty good, although I was hoping for a little less sweet and more spice to the chicken.  The dough was also a touch sweet, it could have used a little bit more crunch. In all, for lunch, it was a little expensive, but at least I had some leftovers to take home.  Service was pretty good, the view was agreeable, and the weather was excellent.  I know CPK has no control over the weather, but it certainly doesn't hurt to eat here on a nice day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=420

Jeff C.,"South San Francisco, CA",131,192,10,2.0,6/8/2008,"CPK has some kick ass pizza, but for a high price. However, everything else about this particular location is not kick ass. My main problems with this place is the service. When we were first seated, we had a party of 6, but were only brought 5 plates and settings. Not a big deal, we just stole a plate and setting from the empty table next to us. But then, we never got our bread. But the food came fast so I wasn't complaining. As we ate, the waitress asked us ""is everything OK?"" But from her expression, it was as if she was thinking, ""You better say YES, or I'll kill you!"" Our waitress seemed quite unfriendly. She did bring me a refill on my soda without me asking for one which was nice, but she didn't bring my friends any refill for their water.  As for the pizzas, I ordered the Wild Mushroom pizza w/grilled chicken, what I usually get from CPK. It has cremini, shitake, and some other types of mushrooms. My friend ordered the Chipotle Chicken pizza, and i tried a bite of that and i thought it was awesome. This pizza is quite good and they make it pretty fast. It's just that the price is quite high for what it is. It is just pizza afterall. For all 6 of us, we ended up paying just under $100 including tax and tip.

C T.,"Daly City, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/27/2008,"My girlfriend, my best friend and I went to this restaurant yesterday, July 25th.  We were all famished, so we decided to drop by California Pizza Kitchen for a quick bite before heading over to Ikea.  Worst mistake ever. I'd never been to a CPK but my girlfriend recommended it, and I love pizza, so I thought, ""What the hey.""  When we arrived the place was moderately busy, maybe about halfway full.  We were seated within five minutes, and the hostess who seated us was actually very pleasant.  Probably the only good thing about our visit.    Our server showed up punctually, and took our drink orders.  His name was Guillermo and he seemed nice enough.  After he got our drink orders he took out lunch orders and we waited for our food.  It was at about this time that we noticed we had no silverware or napkins.  Since our server was nowhere to be found, we had to scrounge other tables for silverware.  We managed to find a napkin and silverware for my girlfriend to eat her salad with.  Looking around the restaurant, we could see other tables getting plates of bread as appetizers.  We never received any bread. Once our entrees arrived the problems began.  First of all, our server mixed up mine and my friend's orders.  My friend and I are both males, both about the same body build, but that's where the similarities end.  He's blond, I'm brown-haired.  He has a scraggly half-bearded face, mine isn't as grown-in.  I'm 6'0"", he's 5'10"".  He has longer, overgrown hair, mine's a little shorter.  You get the picture.  Our server didn't.   The pizza was great, I had the carne asada steak.  We never received any napkins, so I ended up using the tiny napkins our drinks were set on.  Our server stopped by once to see if we were okay, when he did I had food in my mouth but he didn't wait 5 seconds for me to answer him, and left.  He walked by at least 5 more times and didn't even glance our way, even when we tried to flag him down.  Once we were done with our meal, a busser came to clear our plates.  We went through our water but never got offered a refill.  Once our server somehow saw that we were finished, he offered us dessert.  We declined, and he brought us the bill. Since we're all poor college students, we split the bill 3 ways.  We all paid with card.  My friend and I both have bank cards with our picture on them, so you think it would be very easy to split up the bill by what we look like.  However, as I mentioned earlier, our server thought my friend and I were twins separated at birth.  When he returned, the bills were split up wrong, my friend had my $13 check and I had his $30 check.  I had to flag him down again to get our bills switched around.  He returned shortly after, saying that even when he was standing in front of us with both of our cards in his hand, he couldn't tell us apart.  Wow. After that whole fiasco was taken care of, we got up and left.  On the way out, we bumped into our server, who completely ignored us instead of giving us a nice ""Thank you!"" or even a half-assed, ""Cya!""  In fact, none of the employees at all said ""Thank you.""   To make a long story short, this was the worst service in a restaurant I have ever experienced.  The server's name again was Guillermo, and out of a $60 check he got a total tip of 18 cents.  He deserved every penny of that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=420

""orgasm...when i'm having sex i...."" did i really just hear that? and who said that loud enough for me to hear it two tables away? my boyfriend said that there was a table of three employees on their break eating. not cool. so i survey the restaurant again and still notice that there are hella open tables. so why weren't we seated there?  anyway, ricardo continues to give us great service and in the end makes up for the ridiculousness of being seated near rude employees. the new indian mango curry pizza was awesome. i tried the new chicken marsala dish, pretty mediocre. but i should have known better than to order something like that at cpk. ooh and their tortilla soup and adobe chicken chowder was awesome. two stars for ricardo and for pretty standard food.  bad employees... go find a break room.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=520

The shrimp was fresh and soft and was mixed in with harder textures like red cabbage, carrots, rice sticks, and with the crunchiness of wontons made the texture so wonderful in every bite.

They tried to seat us back in the corner of a little alcove that was full of people.  We declined that table choice & they easily accomodated with a more appropriate table.   Service was prompt, both the appetizers and the pizzas were good and we were given cheerful farewells from the hosts on our departure.   In the past, I have seen service a little slow, and I've seen it take forever for a table to get bussed, but these things didn't affect our dining experience.

Anyway, each and every time I frequent this restaurant, I always feel as if I'm treated poorly.  Sometimes the servers don't even notice me and fail to acknowledge me for 7-10 minutes.  Today was different because the server took my order immediately.  However, she brought me the tiny end pieces of the bread loaf - the hard pieces that nobody wants.  This is the second time this has happened as if I'm not worthy of a full slice of bread.  Also, they are so stingy with the bread.  You get two slices even though the pasta costs over $10.00!  If you ask for more bread, the servers react as if you asked for a cure for cancer.  They eventually offer you a second helping of bread with a sigh.  That is if you can actually flag down your AWOL server.  Many times the food runner will bring your entree and you never see your server again until it is time to pay.  Rarely does a server check-in to inquire about your meal or offer you a refill.  You either have to find a bus boy or wave your arms in the air.  This happens over and over again. Despite the consistently terrible service, the food is pretty decent considering it is a chain.  I do enjoy their pasta and pizzas.  It's not as good as some traditional Italian tratorias but it does taste better than Olive Garden, for instance.  The desserts are yummy too but terribly overpriced. I'm still undecided if I will return to this location once my gift cards are depleted.  I don't think it's worth the hassle.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=500
Johnny C.,"Emeryville, CA",33,151,5,2.0,7/7/2008,"Ehhhhh I've been to CPK quite a few times.  I can't say their pizzas are spectacular, by any means, but if you know which ones you like, they can be decent. I tend to stick with the thai, bbq chicken and jamican jerk.  One thing all of these pizzas have in common is that they showcase the sweet and savory (with a bias toward the sweet) aspects of the dish quite well.  One pizza is enough for a meal, or two (if you don't want to stuff yourself).     I also like their avocado club egg rolls.  I've had them a few times and unfortunately the quality isn't very consistent.  There were times when they were the perfect balance of butter, sweet and savory...other times, ehhhh. For this CPK in particular, their staff is a bit shady.  I went here with my co-workers for a birthday lunch during a time when they had a promotion where you were given a mystery pouch with a prize ranging from 10% off your meal to $25,000.  We had told our waiter it was our co-workers b-day and all he said was ""oh, happy birthday""...so we thought that was that.  Toward the end of the meal our waiter comes out with a piece of chocolate cake.  We were pleasantly surprised and much appreciated this gesture.   Unfortunately, when it came time to pay for the bill he initially didn't want to accept our coupon for 10% off because he said we had used our promotion on the birthday cake.  We were all a bit confused because we had not asked for the cake.  OK, perhaps he thought we implied it when we informed him it was our co-workers birthday... but still, he didn't inform us about any policy regarding the use of only one promotion per visit.  Who knew a birthday cake was a promotion?  If he had told us that we would have definitely used the promotion instead of the cake because 10% of our bill would have been greater than the cost of an entire cake, not just one slice.   Anyhoo, we eventually got the manager to give us our discount, but the fact that they tried to pull one over on us makes puts this place on the black list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=500

My son has severe, life threatening, food allergies. And not just one, so eating out can be very stressful for my family. Eric made sure to listen to my concerns and had no problem answering questions and double checking ingredients. All the while smiling and keeping the mood light and happy. The kitchen staff messed up my son's order and Eric caught it before it even got to the table. Meanwhile mine and my Fiancè's food came out on time and cooked deliciously. He had the jumbalaya pasta, it was amazing! He is a hard sell and he loved it from bite 1. I had the tostada pizza, also done to perfection. Eric made sure to bring my son's side dishes out so he wouldn't have to wait any longer to eat. A true delight to have a waiter that is really good at what he does.

The place wasn't too packed and we were seating almost immediately and I ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza. We got our food after probably 10-20 minutes, so not bad. The Pizza was excellent, they were not stingy on the chicken and BBQ and it was cooked to excellence. I forgot to tell them not to put onion on it, but it didn't even hinder my enjoyance of it, dare I say it added and made me enjoy it even more. Our server was very nice(she was fine as hell too with big a...I'll stop there) and we were checked up on multiple times.  I'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=320
Fewreservations S.,"Berkeley, CA",0,17,6,2.0,1/6/2015,Awful is the word! I decided to give 2 stars just because of decent service..the pizza was burnt and dry.  The wild mushroom pizza had the potential to be a good pizza but was destroyed by the cook by over cooking and burning the pizza. The pear and gorgonzola had I think hazelnuts which tasted bitter as if they were stale,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=320
Sarah B.,"Chicago, IL",252,249,126,3.0,5/25/2009,"This is my favorite CPK location I've been to.  I've also visited the locations in Pleasanton and Santa Barbara.  Anyhow, I've been to the Emeryville location twice in the last few months, once for lunch and more recently for dinner. The lunch experience was pleasant.  I don't remember who my server was, but we were seated promptly by a friendly hostess.  Our server was great about refilling our glasses and checking on us often.  My friend and I shared a half size order of the Waldorf Chicken Salad, my personal favorite.  It was celery, lettuce, sliced grapes, candied walnuts, and gorgonzola cheese.  The dressing choices are vinagrette or bleu cheese; we chose the vinagrette.  As always, the salad was delicious.  We also shared the Supreme Pizza, which was as a tasty as a standard pizza should be.  The time I went for dinner was on a Friday night.  It was pretty busy, but we were seated within 20 minutes for a party of two.  It took a little while for our server to greet us, etc, but he was very friendly.  His name was Gabe and he was maintaining a great attitude even during a very busy time.  He was great about communicating with us that if we needed anything we could just wave at him.  He got our orders correct and refilled my glass in a timely fashion.  This time we had another Waldorf Chicken Salad, as always delicious.  We each ordered our own pizza this time.  My friend ordered the Club pizza which I sampled.  The pizza had lettuce and avocado with bacon on it, and it was ok.  The food itself wasn't bad, but I just didn't like the combination of flavors.  I ordered one of the Napoleon style pizzas, with the thin crust.  I was slightly disappointed because the crust felt too soft, and the menu described it was crispy.  All-in-all, this experience was pleasant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-emeryville?start=320
Reena P.,"Dixon, CA",176,500,234,4.0,12/6/2012,"I'm generally not a fan of chain restaurants but I actually do like CPK and its many locations throughout well, California.  The Emeryville location is satisfactory just like the rest I've been to.  Good service and usually not too bad of a wait even on a busy night.  My last trip to this one was a weekday evening (pretty late) and it was nearly a full house.  Our server was friendly and chatty but made sure we were well attended to.  I am a big fan of the small plates especially the chicken tinga quesadilla.  We had the avocado egg rolls this last time around and they were pretty tasty too.  I tend to stick to pizzas when eating here because it's a safe bet although I will admit that they Chicken Tequila Fettuccine is tasty.  I am personally a fan of the BBQ Chicken pizza and the Tostada pizza.  Both are good on the regular crust as well as the honey wheat (if you're in a healthy mood).  Not really a fan of the desserts here.  They are pretty standard and nothing special worth yelping about.  Drinks are good for the price.  Oh yeah and little tip - if you're a fan of the bread and butter that's complimentary, you have to ask your server for it.

They have lots of flavors of tea, including raspberry! Yum. This place is pretty good when you wanna take a group out with many different tastes, everyone will be satisfied! I am also in love with Red Velvet cake, and it is very good here!

They are all the same not a delight to the taste buds, I felt that I would rather eat at a street vendor then at CPK.

What I meant to say is that I really like the crust, so having less of it was not for me. The optional honey wheat crust on the mango tandoori pizza was great.

Derrick S.,"Oakland, CA",0,5,,5.0,2/9/2013,"After a mediocre pizza back in Oct. 2012, I was contacted by CPK and invited back to try out some NEW pizza crusts that were being changed due to some comments posted by me. The ""Marketing Director"" and I arranged a pizza tasting with some new formulas. I brought in 12 people from all walks of life and we tasted some new pizzas that were not yet released to the general public and to give our opinions about the new crusts. All of us in the taste tests gave our input and some suggestions for some new additions to their menu. On the Monday (2/11/13) ""Roll-Out"", you'll have some interesting additions that we approve of and hope CPK adds the comments.

There are times where there are very nice waiters and waitresses. Other times, they are very rude. One even took all my change and kept it as tip. I was not too happy about that.

My husband ordered garlic creme fettuccine, which he loves but also complained that it was just too little for the price. He also ordered some beers while I ordered sugar free peach italian soda which we also enjoyed. We were undecided on whether we wanted dessert when the waiter offered the menu, so my husband said well think about it.
