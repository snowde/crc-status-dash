Bruno Z.,"Granada Hills, CA",112,12,2,5.0,1/5/2018,Great service. Plates came out quick. Everything tasted very fresh. Apparently all restaurant chains are not created equal. Two thumbs way up!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-encino
J L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,16,3,2.0,10/23/2017,"I ordered this place last night to enjoy their chicken tequila fettuccine pasta to go. I usually order from the Tampa location located in the northridge mall but for some reason the price for the pasta was listed at 37$ through postmates so I decided to order at another location where the price was around 16$ for the same plate.  When it got to my house I was so excited because USUALLY that pasta is to die for! So good! I was extremely upset at what I got in my box. First, I asked for sundried tomatoes (normally not a problem to add at the Tampa location) to be added to my pasta. For some reason  they cut up a whole tomato and just threw it in so that added a weird taste overall. To add to that, the pasta tasted nothing like it should have. It was too oily, the sauce was completely off and the chicken tasted bland and undercooked like there was no seasoning added. I know the (not sundried) tomatoes may have changed the taste overall but my boyfriend had ordered the same plate with extra chicken no tomatoes and it STILL tasted like something a first grader threw together. So disappointed. And if this is how the food normally is, I won't be ordering from this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-encino
Chrissy T.,"Los Angeles, CA",107,39,15,3.0,10/3/2017,"Decor - Very yellow. Entrees/ food - I always get the waldorf salad and bbq chicken pizza. The salad is always perfect, but sometimes the BBQ chicken pizza doesn't have enough sauce on it. Dessert - Salted caramel pudding is too sweet. Drinks - cucumber reviver is refreshing. Kids love -  any of the pastas. Price - ok. ** I always feel rushed (by the servers). Countless times I've eaten here, I've wanted to order another cocktail, but they give me my bill instead, before asking if I needed anything else. I think I'm a pretty nice customer - Am I that dispensable ??!!! But I've been coming to CPK for years because their Waldorf salad is still one of the best versions around, so I'll still be nice and give them a 3/5. **",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-encino
Ashtin Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",109,6,7,2.0,9/27/2017,"I love the CPK franchise. I am a huge fan of their menu and everything CPK.  These two stars are purely for service and hospitality. My two friends and i came into this location at 8 o clock maybe just a few mins after 8, but nonetheless more than an hour if not an hour and half before closing. It's not busy, just a couple of tables The hostess, I didn't catch her name, didn't seem very happy to seat us. Being a young group, all of us about 20, i figured a little attitude was just because we were ""kids."" Then again though, we are 20. We sat down for a gooooood 10+ mins before our server, Andrew, came to say hello. Again, it's really not that busy. He takes our order it's all good. After a while, we didnt get the complimentary bread, so we asked for some. He brought the bread, but we didn't get plates. We waited for him to come back either with plates out just to even come outside to check on his other tables which didn't happen. We waited to the point where i got up and went to get the plates myself. Once we finished the bread, i stacked up the plates and put them right on the corner for him so it's easier for him to pick it up later on to clear the table. the food comes out pretty fast and he put it down on the table but doesn't pick up the dirty plates stacked neatly for him. throughout the entire dinner the plates were still on the table. when we were finally all done with our dinner I stacked up every single plate for him on the table so it was easier for him to clear it. finally comes out to check up on us we order dessert and ask for the check. the desert took a little while to come out. a chocolate souffle that turned out to just be a chocolate brownie? (we also got charged for additional ice cream we didnt order but that's okay). the check did not come. I had to get up again to go get the check. we left at 9:30. it took an hour and a half for two entrees one appetizer and one dessert. it wasn't the food that took long to come out but it was more the server. we waited a while for just small things.  waiting for him to come back and get our credit cards and for him to bring the check back so we can sign it also took a while. gave him our validation tickets for parking and he didn't bring that back we had to go in and get it ourselves.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-encino

Moving on...to the food The pizza was sub par, below average... I used to love and praise the pizza but I don't know if the pizza specifically here sucks or just at all the CPK's now. The dough was soft and soggy, didn't taste freshly hand made as it usually does.  The pasta was also extremely thin on sauce, so most of it was plain pasta and we paid an extra $3 for chicken upgrade and it only came with 2 pieces of chicken :/ Ok well what can I say that's good now to end this review?

I couldn't complain about one thing that she did.... she made us all laugh and my mom couldn't get enough of her she was amazingly great, respectful, funny, energetic, and gorgeous. She even allowed my baby niece to order for herself and the best part was that she made sure it was okay with us. She ran all our food and gave us so much bread because we LOVE BREAD. We felt so bad we made her run and get us bread like 6 times but she always had a beautiful smile on her face and cracked multiple jokes as she did to her other table that were next us.  Encino CPK is the place to be... But only if PRISCILLA is serving you! You could never go wrong with having Priscilla as your server.  Cpk staff is lucky to have a great young woman like her.

My ribeye was chewy , my brownie was served cold , with cold ice cream , mmmm brownie that taste like refrigerant. I knew they would think i was trying to get a freebie so i waited until AFTER i paid to let them know that it was served cold , regardless though my daughter ate it cause 5 year olds just see chocolate chocolate chocolate. but what really motivated my review was the waiters response. What do you want me to do about it? I dont know how about apologize , offer me a new one, offer me one to go , you know ... have some sense of customer service man. If i have to tell you what to do i think that's a problem So i think the yelp 2 stars is fitting for this , meh , ive experienced better service , better cooking better hospitality at other pizza kitchens.

Shawn S.,"Boise, ID",288,180,502,3.0,2/5/2015,"Good food really enjoyed my meal. The service was good as well.  We had the avacado egg rolls they were really tasty. Bacon, cheese, tomato, chicken, and avacado.  Great bite  Had the bbq chicken salad as well the chicken was fresh and the bbq sauce was really good.  For dinner we had the BBQ chicken pizza. Awesome sauce. Baked to perfection. The chews was good with onion and cilantro no overwhelming at all.  The only down fall that I saw was when I asked for the check with out looking at the bill I just handed him my credit card. When the bill came back to sign the waiter underlined the 20% tip that I should pay or that he thought he deserved. Thought that was a little out of bounds there.  Like I didn't know how to tip or he thought I should give him 20%. I gave him more but thought It was a little disrespectful at the same time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-encino?start=40

Allison C.,"Los Angeles, CA",180,143,351,4.0,1/30/2016,"I hadnt been to CPK in many years and had always thought of CPK as being kind of mediocre. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was here. I went here for a birthday of a family member and we had a large table of 9. The service throughout the meal was good and the staff was attentive. I ordered the cedar planked salmon which came with a corn succotash. i asked if i could substitute roasted potatoes for the succotash because it had bell peppers in it which i cannot eat, this wasnt an issue however they charged me an extra $2 to do so which i found very weird. When i asked why the guy said something about it being more expensive, ad I'm thinking potatoes are one of the cheapest ingredients there are...anyway, the roasted potatoes were delicious and worth the $2 charge. The salmon was a little bit on the dryer side but overall i really enjoyed it. The complimentary bread and dipping oil was nice to have as well. They had a seasonal salad that i cant remember the name of but it was outstanding, it had farro, a grain i hadnt had before which i really enjoyed. parking is free when they validate your ticket. it was pretty noisy when were first arrived at 715 but after 8 it quieted down a lot. overall it was good food and good service. i did feel though, the prices were a bit high, specifically for the steaks, fish dishes, etc.  for what you get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-encino?start=40

The restaurant was not very crowded. I had to keep asking for water before they finally brought it. The server kept apologizing and knew service was bad. I understand that sometimes these things can happen however, I did not appreciate the fact that the manager was selective about which tables she would personally visited to apologize for any issues.

Laura D.,"Los Angeles, CA",225,299,343,3.0,9/25/2014,I'm really having mixed feelings on how many stars to give. I wrote a review on another location. I had received vouchers for free stuff. I decided to use a coupon here to give it a shot. I never ate here after my bad experience and unfortunately I still feel that way after this visit. We ordered the white pizza which was both salty and had no flavor so we got the Sicilian pizza which was much better. But I only had 1 slice. The dessert was really good. Got the Caramel pudding. So yummy! Got the cheese ravioli and it was pretty good. Bread was good too. Ok now the service. Ummm worst service than the location I left a review on. It we not very busy and at one point we were literally the only people there. Our waiter was nice but a little rude towards the end while trying to get our receipt fixed. Super slow! The manager and employees were chatting up a storm forever sitting near the register. They were so loud! At one point they all sat down to eat. Like really! Umm you have customers! How rude! So annoying.  The nicest person there was the hostess. I really don't want to come back again.

Scott H.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,2.0,4/30/2017,the management here leaves a lot to be desired.  I was in last night for dinner and was disappointed in the lack of customer service the manager provided.  I was sitting on the patio and had to go in into the dining room because our pizzas were cold.  When the I asked the girl at the bar for the manager she called her over and the manger told her to tell me to hold on.  This was around 9pm so it wasnt very busy anymore she was just hanging out by the kitchen.  Once she came up to me she did end up taking care of my pizzas but it was the way that she carried herself that was  disappointing. her attitude was that of one that was being bothered by someone that was asking for free things when all I wanted was my food to be hot which is not too much to ask when you are a paying customer.  To top it off as I was walking back to my table I glanced over and I could see her talking and rolling her eyes which I'm going to assume this was all geared towards me since I had just spoken to her.  This person should go back to training because if this is how she carries herself she is not only rude but is VERY unprofessional.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-encino?start=40

Jenn C.,"North Hills, CA",1,19,4,1.0,7/23/2016,"I love CPK. Their food is always stellar and a treat to enjoy. Sadly, this location must have been  having a bad day. I ordered the California Fields salad, which has become a favourite with me. It was brought out in decent time, but there was a big piece of white lint sticking right out of the chicken at the top. How that got past the kitchen, I'll never know. I also don't know how the waiter didn't see it. So I called the manager and she sent it back. The next salad came back clean, or so I thought until I began mixing the chicken into the rest of the salad. Another piece of lint stuck to the greens poked out. Appetite lost, I called the waiter over. By that point, I just told them to take it off the bill and then bring the amended bill over, which they did. They did offer a replacement of some sort, but by then my appetite was gone and I didn't trust anything else from that kitchen.  Not going back. I wouldn't be surprised about something like this happening at some dive or fast food place.

I tried one of their 'favorites,' the fish tacos. They had a great presentation. good salsa and a side of avocado. The fish itself wasn't too greasy or fried-feeling.

The waiter asked me if I wanted salt on the rim of the glass of my drink, I said yes. My drink came with no salt on the rim. To me, that isn't such a big deal so I didn't say anything.  The second thing I would like to address is the manager that was walking around asking people how everything was. What offended me was how she asked every other table excluding ours.

For those warm SF Valley days, they have a great patio and with the restaurant being on the second floor, it makes for a good outdoor meal.  They also have a large waiting area because anyone who eats at a CPK knows you're gonna have to wait a bit to get a table on the weekends.  Great set up and great service from the staff.  I like the fact that the staff is comfortable with the customers and make conversation-no robots.

Our party of four arrived mid-week before any dinner rush. The restaurant was not even half full. However, service was extremely slow. Not sure if they were short-staffed in terms of servers or kitchen staff. There seemed to be many people walking around with headsets - but perhaps they weren't communicating?  We had to change our table as the late afternoon sun was reflecting off a building nearby. It looked like blinds had been removed for some reason (the brackets were still visible). Our drink order came in a fair amount of time. I had iced coffee with cream and sugar - but it came without a spoon to stir. Our server quickly came back with a spoon. We waited longer than we would have liked for our meal. There were no complimentary breads or chips to start. I think this is true of all CPK locations? I noticed other tables waiting for food as well.  When the meals arrived, one of the pasta dishes was not hot. Our server took it back and returned with a new dish (not just re-heated). That was a pleasant surprise.  My fish tacos were a bit skimpy, though the mahi mahi was fine. There could have been some additional sauce on the coleslaw. There really weren't too many people in the restaurant so it seemed like service should have been better. Maybe the kitchen was busy cooking for pick up customers?

Our office orders from this CPK quite a bit. Today I went to pick up an order for four people. It was extremely busy, they were understaffed with servers, and a pile-up had formed at the take-out counter. From order to pick-up, it took over an hour for them to have our food ready. I'm sure no one in line was happy, but no one was being vocal or threatening either.  Nonetheless, when we finally got our order, they just gave it to us for free. That was surprising. I'm used to lame consolation prizes from other restaurants like a free appetizer they were going to throw away anyway as goodwill bribes for poor service. A free meal? That usually takes some grumblin', and there was no grumblin' here. I'd be even more ecstatic if I were saving myself money instead of my office.

I had to ask the hostess to bring us some. I had the Chinese chicken salad and mango tea. My salad was not very fresh, lettuce was super soggy not crispy. My friend said her cobb salad was good. Guess I was the only unlucky one. I also noticed the bread wasn't very fresh either. Not sure if I would come back to the this location, the other two are much much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-encino?start=100

Janel V.,"Los Angeles, CA",68,14,,2.0,5/29/2012,"I give this place two stars because while the food & busboy were awesome,  the service was deplorable!! My co-worker & I (who both work in a restaurant) had worked up quite the appetite due to shopping for about 5 hours.  We decided to go to CPK because she really likes it & it was close by.  When we arrived the host was friendly enough, and sat us down and told us our server would be with us shortly. Now, as previously stated, I've worked in restaurant in for years & totally understand when it's busy and it may take you awhile to get to the table.  It was actually a pretty mellow night, and we were in a chill mood, so we sat looking over the menu and waiting for someone to take our drink order.  And waited.....and waited....and waited.  I honestly hate giving bad reviews because I can relate to having a bad day or being swamped.  But when you have all that extra help, seems a little odd it would take that long.  Once our food order was in, that came out really fast and was amazing.  Try the roasted peach salad, it is so freaking good!!! I want to make it clear that the server wasn't rude, just  inattentive and not very friendly.  We saw her once the whole time we ate...that's with an appetizer, salad & our entrees that we had to get through.  Didn't drop our food, didn't check to see if we were ok.  She actually walked past us and didn't even give us a second look.  On the other hand, the busser was amazing.  Friendly as could be, helpful and got us refills. &  bread while we waited. Towards the end of our meal, our server came over  to check on us and to box our food up.   Even with not friendly service, I can't help but leave 20% as it's practically ingrained in me to do so.  It was for the busser mainly, but I know he didn't get to keep it :(  Had this place been busier or if they didn't have bussers and food runners to help, then I'd be way more lenient on the service. So, we packed up and then we left, with not a single person said goodby to us...not even our server that we passed on our way out. All in all, great food but lackluster service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-encino?start=100

Their cobb salad can't be beat imo.  The greens are chilled just right, applewood smoked bacon, chicken, (with or without) beets, avocado and bleu cheese with just the right amount of sharpness. You can order half portions of the salads.   I can't stress this enough: SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT because they have THEE MOST AMAZING butter cake in the world! They warm it up and put vanilla ice cream on top and you'll think you've died and gone to heaven. It's enough for two but you won't want to share.  James as a server is the best!

My friend who is vegetarian ordered the barbecue chicken salad but substituted the chicken for avocado and although it was tasty, the cook failed to remove the chicken so it had to be returned to wait for a new salad.  The Spinach flat bread appetizer wasn't bad but a little expensive for its tiny size @ $7.50.  The arugula salad with asparagus was tasteless and had hardly any asparagus. My friend ordered the cheese macaroni appetizer and much to her disappointment was informed later that they were out of it. How long does it take to make another batch of it? So all in all we weren't doing too well.  But then the excellent manager took over and made good on all their mistakes by giving us a wonderful free dessert which made us all VERY happy in the end.  I highly recommend the Butter cake with ice cream and whipped cream.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-encino?start=80

Chuck C.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",75,102,119,5.0,1/23/2015,"Its been a while since we've gone to CPK.  The menu has changed bit, and no longer had my Shrimp Parmesan or Shrimp Diavolo.   I ordered the SHRIMP SCAMPI ZUCCHINI FETTUCCINE, my wife ordered GARLIC CREAM FETTUCCINE with chicken. My daughter order the HABANERO CARNITAS pizza and my son had mac n cheese.  Since we signed up for their Pizza Dough rewards, we received a small plate selection for free.  We chose the CRISPY MAC 'N' CHEESE.  It was really good. When they brought our meal they brought a CARNITAS TACOS plate instead of the Habanero Carnitas pizza. We told them it should be the pizza, and they took it back. Brandon our server came over and apologized for the error.  I told him, its OK.  But you can bring back the tacos if you're just going to throw them away.  We laughed as he brought them back. The tacos looked good and so did the salsa.  WTH? Who would think that carnitas tacos at CPK would really be good.  I will be the first to say, they were awesome! The carnitas, the avocado salsa and the red salsa were incredible.  Wendy (the manager) came over and apologized and ask how we liked the tacos. I told basically what I said before.  I really didn't think they were going to be that good, but they were amazing. Tina had intended to only eat half of her Fettuccine, but finished it off.  I of course not only devoured one of the carnitas tacos, but finished my Shrimp Scampi. The staff were very friendly, attentive and personable.  We didn't have dessert, but had mentioned the Butter Cake we would have to try on our next visit. The manager walked over and was disappointed we were about to leave.  She said she was going to bring us a Butter Cake on the house.  We thanked her, but told her how full we were. So she offered to send it home with us!  You know, it really was ""As good as it gets!""

I came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and there were a ton of people. Nearly the entire inside seating area was full.

Joey P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/27/2016,"DO NOT EVER EAT AT THIS CPK. THE MANAGER, MANNI IS THE RUDEST AND MOST UNPROFESSIONAL MANAGER of any restaurant we have ever been to!!!  After waiting for over an hour for three salads and three Mac and cheese for the kids, I decided to let the manager know. Once I asked for the manager, some guy in the kitchen turns to me (from the Kitchen and we were in the dining area) and says yah.  Not a hello, not a can I help you, not even a, you need something? All I got was yah. Once he finally came to our table, I asked him, is this how he was trained by CPK, to just say Yah from the kitchen? He then said what is the problem. I explained to him that we have been waiting for over an hour for our food and that all we had were 3 salads and 3 Mac and cheese. His reply........you haven't been here an hour. It's been 50 min.  Instead trying to fix the problem he made it a bigger problem. Given that CPK has multiple locations and owners, I would suggest to the district manager that you need to retrain your GMs as they are clueless and rude when it comes to handling customer complaints.  Had Manni handled it like any other manager and simply said, I'm sorry, let me fix the problem, I would never have written this review and there wouldn't be hundreds of other potential customers reading this 1 star review either.  I guess CPK and all the officers don't give a crap about service. Maybe this is why they have NO LOCATIONS with any higher than a 3 star Yelp rating.

We ordered an appetizer and pizzas, and a couple of other tables who were seated after us got their food before we did. The two people who were helping us were nice, but the service was very slow, and there were several servers (and cooks) standing around talking to each other. I noticed other tables looking up for their servers during this time, as well. Food (3 stars): The tortilla spring rolls were okay (do NOT recommend the Thai ones) and our pizzas were good.

I never really had a problem with the CPKs I usually go too but this one was just not as great as the other ones. I had lunch with my friend because she had gift cards here that CPK corporate have her from a past bad visit. When we got to this location it was not full at all because we were having a late lunch. First order drinks and our waiter was nice! I order a coke but then change my mind and wanted the leamonade instead and he was very nice about that. Then I said a comment to my friend ""why didn't he take our menus?"" Because I thought we order for some reason and then I realized ""oh he hasn't even taken out order!"" And we laughed because I can be an air head sometimes! Haha the waiter comes out of no where and was all like "" I heard you said that I didn't take your order yet!"" I explained to him what happen and he didn't seem amused. So we get our food, the ravioli was so good and then the white pizza not so good! We changed that for the Sicilian pizza which was better. When we wanted to change the pizza we had to talk to the manager first. He was nice and friendly but I can tell he seemed annoyed that we wanted to change the order. When we asked our waiter for his opinion he had an attitude about it saying ""well my most favorite was crossed out"" just a weird thing to say. So then we get the check and he forgot to take off the coke I had order and when we try to track him down as he was talking to an other waiter but kept looking at us he finally came over and I told him he left the coke oh their still and he respond ""ohhhhhh I diddddd?!"" I don't know how to take that so he took the check and never apologized when he was giving us back out check!  Now don't get me started on the costumer service! When we were sat down everyone who freaking worked there seemed to be on a break and were all sitting/standing by there larger table in the restaurant all on their phones and just talking so loudly I could not enjoy my meal. Just talking about gossip and boyfriend issues and things that they should not talk about. It's just weird because they weren't in their break room. And the managers joined them too.

Might as well go to macaroni grill. The pizza is very mediocre. It's not fresh and homemade. Just by tasting it it tasted like it was from the market. There are way better restaurants around. The Tarzana location is better.      One thing I really enjoyed that really surprised me was the ribeye steak. I was never a fan of your food, but that steak was one of the best steaks I ever tried. I am not exaggerating about that. It tasted like you killed a cow in the kitchen and cooked it on the spot. They really surprised me. That was too good. Do You guys have your own farm? Because the steak tasted like you did. There is no way that was refrigerated. That steak was probably the reason why karma went out of business.

Maryam R.,"Encino, CA",64,164,15,5.0,6/28/2011,"It's hard to review a chain restaurant without being biased.  This one is especially challenging since I've always loved CPK. However, yesterday we received ""review worthy"" service.  Not only was the staff super sweet but, they went the extra mile when preparing my baby's food.  They cut everything up for me into little pieces which saved me a huge headache.  That has never been done for me before in any other restaurant. Usually the kid's meals at most restaurants are super greasy with little nutritional value but, they've added some great stuff. You can now get your little monster grilled chicken pieces with broccoli and if you want you can substitute fruit for the broccoli free of charge.  Awesome! BTW, after your done eating, you can take your little downstairs for a carousel ride for only $1.50.

Diamond D.,"Studio City, CA",13,16,,2.0,3/12/2010,"I couldn't help but to feel overly disappointed as I walked back to the office from my lunch break.  Today I decided to go to California Pizza Kitchen in hopes of eatting something delicious and filling (but not too filling- nothing like going back to work feeling like it's nappy time).  I was seated by a very nice young man followed by my waitress and was presented with about 4 different menus. One for wine and beer, one with health info, one for there new 'smaller portions and items', and then the actual full menu. Wow- now that's a lot of menus.  After browsing all my options I decided to get something new off there 'smaller portions' menu. So I ordered the White Corn Tamale Ravioli. Sounds good doesn't it?  Unfortunately, it wasn't. All I could taste was salt and corn. Salt and corn. Salt. Salt. Salt. and corn. And - although I knew it was off there 'smaller  portions' menu- it was soooooo small. My plate had 4 bite size ravioli's on it, covered in corn and a white sauce. Yes, 4 bite size pieces. ( I don't even think a 3 yr old would be full from this) And the cost... $6.49. That's a whopping $1.62 a bite! I don't know about you- but if I spend close to $7.00 plus tax and tip for a lunch- I better be leaving there filling full and happy.  Instead, I'm sitting here writing this. Feeling way more hungry than I did before and after a soda, a very small dish of food, tax and tip- my bank account is now $11.00 less.

Michael R.,"Encino, CA",1,32,,4.0,4/29/2011,"My wife and I sat down outside on this beautiful spring evening. It is really nice to be able to eat outdoors. The following little story is a perfect metaphor for what CPK is, a corporate restaurant that is above average. The waiter brought out the bread. Three pieces for my wife and I. I joked to the waiter that we were going to fight over the third piece and why bring three small pieces for two people. The waiter explained to me that it was company policy to bring one more slice of bread than there are people at the table. That explains it. Everything about CPK is corporate policy. And what you have is a highly robotic staff and highly standard corporate food. The good news it that the food is pretty good. I had the Cesar Salad and barley/split pea soup. Both above average. I must admit leaving not totally satisfied and at the same time, I had no complaints. One of the things that I really like is that you can try anything and if you don't like it, they will bring you something else. One time I did ask for a different meal and they happily obliged.

Jessica R.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,58,2,3.0,4/8/2010,"Everyone in Los Angeles has been to a CPK somewhere... you either love it or you hate it. This particular location is best if you're getting a group of people together for lunch while you're at work. The staff here is usually very nice and on top of their game. If you frequent enough, which people in my office to, they know your names and drink orders. This is usually a nice perk at restaurants because they treat you well consistently.  As most people agree, CPK is pricey, but that's just the way it goes. The food is consistently good and depending on the day relatively quick. Drinks: I love the flavored iced teas, lemonades are usually good, try to peach or mango iced tea. Yum! Some of my meal favorites are: Avocado Club Rolls (SO delish, so fattening though!), Spring Rolls, Lettuce wraps and Senora rolls! All very good to start! Then main course, my all time favorite is the Waldord Salad, it's so unique and yummy! Next, I love the tortilla soup, it's so much better than any other restaurants, it's so thick and creamy! Makes a delicious starter to lunch or dinner, or good on those cold days. Pesto Creme Penne is one of the best pasta dishes I've tried anywhere, but the portion is huge, TRY it if you love shrimp.  The club sandwiches are awesome too, love those... The pizza...the most important thing on the menu...it is the PIZZA kitchen afterall. My favorites are the California Club, Thai Chicken, Chipotle, White and Pesto Pizza... each has their unique perks. Some people like their pizza plain and simple, cheese and sauce but their pizzas have personality! If you're down for something different, give it a try...if not stick with the White,  Tradiitional or Pepperoni...can't go wrong!
