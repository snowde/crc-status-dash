Elisa B.,"San Marcos, CA",4,41,33,4.0,3/13/2017,"We went for the first time today, as I really wanted to try the kung pao chicken spaghetti. It was everything I hoped it to be my only feedback would be the price for plate was kinda high like $12 bucks and to add chicken it was another $3. The "" $3 "" worth or chicken was questionable as I found maybe 3/4 little mini peaces of chicken lol and the spaghetti plate could have been a little bigger for the price. $8.99 would have been more appropriate for portion size. However all staff we're very friendly and order turn around was great as well as cleanliness was top notch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2?start=20
David Joshua D.,"Valley Center, CA",111,204,1053,4.0,1/6/2017,I recently came here to eat dinner after it opened at the mall. I sat outside in the bar area. It was nice and open. The service was good. Not so busy and it was during happy hour. They have a couple of TVs outside at the bar too. The food was good. It's been a while since I ate at a cpk. The location is nice and right by target. The bar is nice and out in the open in the middle of the mall. There wasn't much on he happy hour. But the food was still good. I'll probably be back here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2?start=20

Kelly H.,"Cardiff, CA",30,3,,1.0,7/11/2017,Restaurant atmosphere was nice but service and food leave little to be desired. Restaurant was not crowded. Server was in over her head with only 4 tables. No one ever checked back on us for anything we needed. Three salads took fourth five minutes. Again in a non crowded restaurant. Salad portions were amazingly small. They should call them quarter sizes not half. It would have been nice at the very least for someone to apologize for taking 45 minutes for three salads. The server and manager need a coarse in customer service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2?start=20

Mark H.,"Ramona, CA",0,8,,1.0,9/5/2017,"Hadn't been to one of these in years but was here for my nephews birthday last night and will never go back. The restaurant was only about 1/3 full but the service was the worst I've had in awhile. Server was clueless. After we ordered an appetizer and dinners, she came back twice to say they were out of our app (lettuce wraps) and then later too say they were out of my dinner - Banh Mi bowl. How does she not know this before? Ordered Ice tea with sugar and she never brought the sugar and never brought the refill I requested. She also must have screwed up our order with the kitchen because my replacement salad was delivered alone and then about 5 minutes later our appetizer came out followed by everyone else's food about 5 minutes after that.. Pretty surprising considering this is a corporate restaurant. You would think the staff would be better trained.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2?start=20
Annette W.,"Vista, CA",0,11,,1.0,4/9/2017,This is really a zero star but I have to put something. We ate here today and dropped a deposit envelope with checks and cash. Of course the employee turned in the envelope with the checks but funny no cash. Funny but sweat hostess was saying to me how honest the staff are and they always turn in money and lost credit cards. Not so honest... Thieves and food sucked! Filing a police report..... update.... My husband went back in and called police dept and made a big ruckus about the stolen money and funny 600 appeared in the trash. Now how did it hop out of the envelope and into their kitchen trash.. Thieves!!! So glad to have my money back though,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2?start=20

Cassandra B.,"Escondido, CA",1,8,2,1.0,8/11/2017,"Honestly, I used to work for CPK a little over a year ago. I understand when it's busy and you can't tend to your tables as much as you would like, but this was not the case. My husband and I decided to go to cpk for dinner after I had a rough week at work and sat out on there cool looking bar area for the first time. It took about 10 minutes for someone to actually greet us and I know that after working for cpk for almost two years that the servers or bartenders have 30 seconds to a minute to at least greet or interact with a new table. It was not busy at the time we sat down and I saw both bartenders look at us and basically ignore us. We were not greeted with bread, we had to ask for it. After our food was dropped, Brandon came by to offered Parmesan cheese for my husband's pasta and never came back to ask us how our food tasted. We sat there and sat there and saw both bartenders leave the bar area. No one was to be found when we needed boxes for our food and when Jordan came back to the bar he looked in our directions but never asked us if we were doing okay. After he closed out his customers at the bar then he decided to ask us if we were doing okay and my husband asked for boxes. We boxed up our own food and I think I recall cpk employees offering to box up the food for their guest. Jordan just gave us boxes and the check and I think that was the quickest thing that was done all night during our visit. It's a shame how bad this was because we really enjoy cpk but I don't think we will return. It was such a shame how bad the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2?start=20

She told us no table available for a party of 6, and if we wanted to wait it might take up to 20 minutes. We agreed, and gave her my phone number so she could text when table was ready. So far so good. After about 12 minutes she sent the text saying that our table was ready! I wasn't too far out, and soon after I arrived to the restaurant I got another text saying that she didn't mean to send the text yet.

I spoke to the manager Jacob and he quickly rectified the situation and was a pleasure to speak to.

Ordered a beer to start dinner and to my disappointment they were out of draft beer. WTF, how can any pizza place, especially a nicer establishment be out of beer?? To me, this is like going to a burger joint and finding out they ran out of fries! Anyway, ordered the 1/2 order of bbq chicken salad which was pretty good. The others in my group ordered various pizzas, soups an flatbreads. All very well presented and tasty. All in all, food was good as always. But, so disappointed that a place as nice as this would run out of not just one draft beer, but no drafts at all available.

Betty H.,"San Diego, CA",0,15,,1.0,12/26/2017,"This is the worst CPK ever, and this is coming from a CPK fan!  We frequent the one by our home, have gone to many locations including LA and Anaheim, and this was by far the absolute worst in service, care and finally their famous pizza.  We ordered the margherita pizza and when they delivered our food they didn't even say anything, but the pizza was completely just a cheese pizza.  When the runner was trying to walk away I had to stop them to ask where the basil was.  The runner tried to explain that they ran out of the ""garnish"", that the basil was usually just a garnish.  Ok, if you have ever had a margherita pizza the basil is one of the best parts of the pizza; and to top it off there was maybe a handful of diced tomatoes and the pizza was Luke warm.  Just a disappointment and no one ever came back to check on us through the meal as we were going to ask them to make another pizza since they basically served us a lukewarm cheese pizza.   Also, even though we had a reservation when we arrived, they said there was a 10 minute wait and the hostess said she had to clean a table.  Meanwhile she stood around talking with a couple coworkers while we waited at the door.  We finally decided to eat in the open courtyard in the center of the mall, and the poor bartender was completely overwhelmed with no help out there.   Overall, understaffed, under trained, mediocre food, poor management and will not be back at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2
Jenny C.,"Carlsbad, CA",5,68,79,4.0,9/4/2017,"Was at the mall and wanted a quick and light bite. Originally, our intention was to sit inside but had to wait 15-20 minutes so we decided to sit out by the bar which was in the mall, right in the center of an open area. It was full service.  We just had the original BBQ chicken pizza and it was pretty good. We also got the bread and oil. The oil had herbs mixed in and was a great dipping alternative for the warm bread and crust of the pizza.  For what we needed to have a bite, it was a nice spot at the mall. The menu looked similar to what I had when I was younger. There are some slight changes to evolve with the times.

Marcus F.,"Escondido, CA",257,1905,3188,2.0,3/15/2017,"Not impressed AT ALL with their service after two visits. I've been here twice now and the service was way below standard. When you pay premium prices you expect more. The first time I came here I had one of the worst server experiences out of all of my 1600+ reviews. Because it was the opening month I decided to give them another chance before writing a review. Hopefully that unhinged waitress was fired or quit..On my second visit the service was just run of the mill and nothing above the minimum. By the way, are there no managers here? I know when I go to Chili's or most other restaurant chains the waitresses almost always give great service. Usually it's because they work their asses off to earn their tips. They probably have families that depend on that money. On both occasions here the waitresses were Millennials,  which I suspect were still living at home, and this was just a job their parents forced them to take. Another issue with this CPK is that they're located in this mall's basement floor. There is poor internet/cell access (Good luck checking into the CPK app from down there) plus if a store isn't on floors 2 or 3 it basically doesn't exist. The Food -  The Pizza should be skipped here. For the price it's not worth it especially when you can get better and half the price at craft-your-own places like pieology.. However, where CPK does excel are their non-pizza items. Their salads are always incredible, and many of their entrees are usually worth their hefty price.  - The Kids meals are a great value for a premium restaurant. Nice selection of Pizzas or noodles and you can even upgrade to a dessert if it's a treat night. - Their rewards program sucks..Once you sign up for their program your free small plate coupon expires in 21 days. No warning that this was going to happen or expire. Also 5 bucks off every 100 you spend isn't that great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2

Juliana C.,"San Diego, CA",659,242,3280,4.0,11/29/2016,"I got to eat here during their soft opening. I was lucky enough to bring a guest with me! Since my gf lives in Escondido, I invited her to join me.  We were greeted and seated right away. The restaurant was not fully packed, but it seemed really busy since there was a full staff running around. We ordered a couple of drinks, Honeybee Lemonade and water for me and she ordered a sprite and Blood Orange sangria. The lemonade was really good, you could hardly taste the bourbon. The sangria was extremely floral, too much for my tastes.  For starters, they brought us a sample of fried Mac and cheese ball and mushroom flatbread. Both were delish! For our entrees, we ordered a full shrimp Cesar salad and the Roasted garlic chicken. The salad was beyond huge, I wish it had more shrimp! The Roasted garlic chicken was so flavorful, I could eat just the garlic bits with the veggies and be perfectly happy. If you love garlic, you'll love this dish! Finishing with a slice of red velvet cake with white chocolate shavings... Love white chocolate!  All the staff was very nice and overly attentive. Good and bad. Every single server and manager checked on us. Filling our glasses with water, even though one was sprite... Constantly trying to clear the table of dishes... when I was not done picking at the bread or salad. Our server was Kiki, she was good and explained they needed to constantly ask if we needed anything and if they could take any dishes. It was too much and somewhat bothersome, but I the end too much attention is better than none.  Don't forget to sign up for Pizza dough rewards, you get a small plate on your first visit and dessert on your birthday! :) They also donated a portion of sales to Make-A-Wish!

It was a super busy evening for the staff, but really cool experience and a great venue! First of all, I have to say I love the bar area, set out in the middle of the mall.  It's really classy, fully stocked, has a food menu, and very visible.  The visibility is one of the reasons I feel like the other bar(s) in the mall haven't been as busy as they should be.  The menu is classic.  We haven't had a CPK near here yet, and it's definitely time.  Awesome thin-crust pizzas (of course), and pretty decent entrees and appetizers as well.  Our event had us sampling several different dishes, and we ordered a few different drinks (all were good!) Anyways, highly recommend this place.  It was also a training night for some of the wait staff, so we'll have to see how things turn out.  I'm very hopeful and excited!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2
Julie T.,"San Marcos, CA",149,408,760,3.0,4/5/2017,"So let me start out by saying that I am not a contrary or belligerent customer. I will also point out up front that I had a very lovely experience at CPK. We took my daughter here to celebrate her making Student of the Month at her school. I've only been CPK once before and it was years ago in Hollywood, but I have great memories of the meal (and a nice Yelp review to look back on).  This Location inside the Westfield Mall is fairly new, so perhaps they are working out the kinks a bit. Our service was wonderful. The hostess sat us promptly, and our waitress was fast, friendly, and very accommodating. The Hubs and Wee One both had pizzas, which were delicious. The crust was crispy, the cheese tasted freshly grated, and the toppings seemed super fresh as well.  My only complaint is with my own food. I ordered the WILD MUSHROOM STROZZAPRETI. It was very tasty, and I did enjoy it, but...it cost nearly $16, and the portion was TINY TINY TINY!!! I mean like, a tennis ball sized portion.  Seriously, are they paying a professional mushroom hunter to source their criminis and white buttons? Was the butter in the sauce imported at great expense from the Basque region of the Pyrenees Mountains? Were the noodles hand-made by Jesus Christ himself?!? I have been a chef for over 20 years: Pasta and mushrooms cost almost nothing. What's wrong with giving your customers an actual entrée portion? Because I feel like that dish should be served as a tapas style appetizer (for 1/3 the price), if that's the portion they're going to push.  So the take-away is this: If you're in the mall and jonesing for a pizza, give CPK a go. Just avoid the over-priced pasta. Next time I will be certain to take my own advice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2
Megan L.,"San Diego, CA",43,4,3,3.0,11/18/2017,"This was my first visit to this location. I was not happily greeted by the hostess. I actually had to get her attention by asking a question and she seemed uninterested but happily directed me to the back of the restaurant to place my to go order. I was then greeted by a very happy waitress who took my order. I asked her about the Bianco FlatBread which she raved about stating that it was the ""freshest thing on the menu""! I ordered that and a large salad. She said it would be ready in about 10 mins and said we could leave and come back or stay and wait. I left and bought a purse at charming Charlie not too far from CPK and when I came back my meal was placed in the bag and I was sent on my way. I only live about 10 mins from the mall. I wouldn't say the flat bread was sitting too long but when I opened the box my gut tells me it had been sitting for quite some time. It also appeared to have been just thrown in the box....Which also seemed like it must have been used prior based on the fact that other names were written on it and scratched out...weird.

As well as what I mean to this city. My server Dan was truly one of a kind. And yet, there was more. For in this crisp time when the winds do shake the darling buds of  summer, the chef brought the grilled fired ribeye, and even added tender potatö finger-liengs that appeared to be harvested locally.The tenderness of the ribeye was not restrained. It was the fulfillment of my gustatory dreams, without the resentful pain that normally arises from wasting $26 at other subpar restaurants. I don't need any more pain. Hell, does anyone? In finality, I will say that my experience at The California Pizza Kitchens's was sublime and my treatment near that of a gladiator most decorated. But the street parking wasn't that great.

We ordered quite easy items....soup, salad and pizza and it really didn't take too long but nothing was very good.  The pizza dough had NO taste whatsoever...I think if my son ate the box it might have had more flavor. The chicken picata was way too thick, the key to that is it must be pounded thin. Any good cook knows how to prepare this simple dish. My salad was messy with large chunks of bleu cheese and chicken....who is teaching these people in the kitchen ?

Ten minutes later, we approached her again and asked why we were waiting still since we could see at least a dozen empty booths. She says that they don't have enough servers for them. Huh!

Adelaid G.,"Oceanside, CA",99,179,65,5.0,2/8/2017,This location is new inside the mall across from target. Same great food that CPK is known for and the same menu you are used to. The service here was great the day that I came. Nothing stellar nor out of the norm to report. Something that is kind of cool about this location is that outside of the restaurant portion they have a bar area. I came in the evening so it seemed cool to have a bar area in the middle of the mall and it was a relaxed chill vibe but I don't know if it would be crazy and loud on the weekends when the mall is packed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2

I have been to this location twice and I have had nothing but an amazing experience both times!!!  I REALLY hope that the quality of service continues after the ""grand opening"" time frame.  Our servers have been Angelina and Shawna. Both of them were absolute sweethearts and were so friendly. Bryan pitched in and helped and he was an absolute doll. So happy with our service.  I've had the chicken fettuccine Alfredo and the BBQ chicken salad with baked potato soup. Both delicious!!!

Michelle D.,"Escondido, CA",0,3,,3.0,12/9/2016,"So my experience with cpk I felt was interesting...the food was good the servers I did not like at all. I have worked in restaurants for years and these servers are super lazy. Now the fact that I noticed you guys had one busser I believe his name was William he is the fastest I have ever seen. But, i witnessed a couple of servers walking around with a whole bunch of dishes and trying to force them into his bus tub. I don't know about cpk but I thought you guys were supposed to be a family environment. When in reality it was uncomfortable. My server was a tall dirty blonde that thinks she is the shit. When I go out to restaurants I like to feel at home and comfortable not feel like I'm at a rave or in high school for that matter. My main question here is why is William a busser and not a server if he worked in my resturaunt he would definitely be promoted. Cpk should watch their back...because with a hard worker like William some big cooperation is going to steal him from you. Also I think it's really sad that the only one that impressed me in that resturaunt was a busser you guys at cpk should definitely get a handle on your employees. If I need my bussers to get trained well I will bring them to cpk to watch a pro and that was William great job young man!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2?start=60

Our server Christina brought our ice tea mine was peach my husbands was raspberry. Christina started to take our order when a female floor manager came over grabbed the teas from our table said they weren't done right then made the poor girl bring back ice teas that the floor manager remade which were wrong she the manager brought us back regular ice tea and yelled at Christine Christine came back and apologized we told her she was fine.   For Christine and food 5 stars.

Michelle K.,"San Marcos, CA",4,6,,1.0,1/5/2017,"I received a gift card from a coworker for the holidays and my boyfriend and I decided to eat there on January 2nd. We chose to eat out at the bar area as it was open seating. Our waitress Sam was very pleasant and kind but she was also the main bartender for the entire restaurant so I think she was having to do too many things at once, this review is not a knock on her personally. We were seated, drink order taken, food order taken and then it was all downhill from there. They were out of bread so we had to wait for the complimentary appetizer to arrive - not a biggie. Several more families and couples were seated after us and we started to notice that everyone that arrived after us was receiving their food. We only ordered a pizza and salad so nothing complicated. After about 30 minutes of waiting AFTER we had ordered our food I finally asked one of the servers (that was delivering another table of food to customers that arrived after us) if our food would be arriving soon as we had already waited a significant amount of time. She apologized, looked into it, and about 10 minutes later we finally received our food. This entire time our server, Sam, only checked on us once early on to see if we liked our drinks, never followed up to be sure we received our food and apparently didn't notice that all of her other tables had received their food. Still we did not complain, sometimes things happen at restaurants and we acknowledge it was probably just a mistake. Once she saw we had finally received our food she came over to check on us, mentioning she would have the manager come by to talk with us. The manager NEVER came by. Then it came time to pay. Remember I had a gift card for this restaurant and I had went onto the CPK website before we arrived, typed in the number, and received the balance. Good to go? Not so much. Sam tried to use the gift card, wouldn't swipe, typed in the numbers, received error message. This happened numerous additional times. Another server tried, then they tried another computer, then the manager tried, all times the card didn't work. Then the manager came to our table to ask about another form of payment. She inquired where the gift card was purchased, noting it was not one from their restaurants. It was a gift, how am I supposed to know. I brought up the information on the CPK website showing the number were valid and the amount of the gift card but she refused to try any further. It was obviously an error with their computers and not my gift card.  It was the tone and bitchiness of the manager and the accusatory nature of her grilling me about the gift card as if I was trying to run a scam on them or something that made me finally complain about the service we had received. Ultimately we paid with another form of payment, the manager took off 20% for my inconvenience, and we didn't leave a tip. Again, I don't blame Sam for the service issues - I believe she was having to do too much. A bartender for an entire restaurant shouldn't be made to also be server to the numerous tables in that area. I have worked customer service before and the manager failed us here. She was unapologetic, rude, and made her customer feel as though I was doing something wrong. For this reason we will never eat at that location again and CPK is one of my favorite restaurants. There are plenty of other restaurants to select at this location, choose one of those. Also to note that CPK customer service is horrible. I left a message and submitted a complaint on January 3rd that has yet to be acknowledge even though I received a general email notifying me they received my feedback and would be contacting me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2?start=40

I was pleased to see that they had a varied menu, but since the place was packed when we got there and had to wait a while (I do not mind waiting when is worth it). After being seated, I ordered a salad and my friends split a pizza and gave me a slice, and it was good. Not the best pizza I've ever tasted, but it wasn't bad either, just average. I think it needed a bit more sauce and maybe oregano or some spice. We also had to ask the busser to help us during our dinner because the waiter had faded away. We wanted to order desserts but by the time the server came back we had waited too long and decided to leave.

Next, the food was much better than other CPK's, showing that the chef and the cooking staff are a cut above.

We just had the original BBQ chicken pizza and it was pretty good. We also got the bread and oil. The oil had herbs mixed in and was a great dipping alternative for the warm bread and crust of the pizza.  For what we needed to have a bite, it was a nice spot at the mall.

Marcus F.,"Escondido, United States",257,1905,3188,2.0,15/3/2017,"Not impressed AT ALL with their service after two visits. I've been here twice now and the service was way below standard. When you pay premium prices you expect more. The first time I came here I had one of the worst server experiences out of all of my 1600+ reviews. Because it was the opening month I decided to give them another chance before writing a review. Hopefully that unhinged waitress was fired or quit..On my second visit the service was just run of the mill and nothing above the minimum. By the way, are there no managers here? I know when I go to Chili's or most other restaurant chains the waitresses almost always give great service. Usually it's because they work their asses off to earn their tips. They probably have families that depend on that money. On both occasions here the waitresses were Millennials,  which I suspect were still living at home, and this was just a job their parents forced them to take. Another issue with this CPK is that they're located in this mall's basement floor. There is poor internet/cell access (Good luck checking into the CPK app from down there) plus if a store isn't on floors 2 or 3 it basically doesn't exist. The Food -  The Pizza should be skipped here. For the price it's not worth it especially when you can get better and half the price at craft-your-own places like pieology.. However, where CPK does excel are their non-pizza items. Their salads are always incredible, and many of their entrees are usually worth their hefty price.  - The Kids meals are a great value for a premium restaurant. Nice selection of Pizzas or noodles and you can even upgrade to a dessert if it's a treat night. - Their rewards program sucks..Once you sign up for their program your free small plate coupon expires in 21 days. No warning that this was going to happen or expire. Also 5 bucks off every 100 you spend isn't that great.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2

Juliana C.,"San Diego, United States",659,242,3280,4.0,29/11/2016,"I got to eat here during their soft opening. I was lucky enough to bring a guest with me! Since my gf lives in Escondido, I invited her to join me.  We were greeted and seated right away. The restaurant was not fully packed, but it seemed really busy since there was a full staff running around. We ordered a couple of drinks, Honeybee Lemonade and water for me and she ordered a sprite and Blood Orange sangria. The lemonade was really good, you could hardly taste the bourbon. The sangria was extremely floral, too much for my tastes.  For starters, they brought us a sample of fried Mac and cheese ball and mushroom flatbread. Both were delish! For our entrees, we ordered a full shrimp Cesar salad and the Roasted garlic chicken. The salad was beyond huge, I wish it had more shrimp! The Roasted garlic chicken was so flavorful, I could eat just the garlic bits with the veggies and be perfectly happy. If you love garlic, you'll love this dish! Finishing with a slice of red velvet cake with white chocolate shavings... Love white chocolate!  All the staff was very nice and overly attentive. Good and bad. Every single server and manager checked on us. Filling our glasses with water, even though one was sprite... Constantly trying to clear the table of dishes... when I was not done picking at the bread or salad. Our server was Kiki, she was good and explained they needed to constantly ask if we needed anything and if they could take any dishes. It was too much and somewhat bothersome, but I the end too much attention is better than none.  Don't forget to sign up for Pizza dough rewards, you get a small plate on your first visit and dessert on your birthday! :) They also donated a portion of sales to Make-A-Wish!

Robert J.,"Escondido, United States",337,515,154,5.0,28/11/2016,"Soft opening event, benefitting the Boys & Girls Clubs of San Diego. It was a super busy evening for the staff, but really cool experience and a great venue! First of all, I have to say I love the bar area, set out in the middle of the mall.  It's really classy, fully stocked, has a food menu, and very visible.  The visibility is one of the reasons I feel like the other bar(s) in the mall haven't been as busy as they should be.  The menu is classic.  We haven't had a CPK near here yet, and it's definitely time.  Awesome thin-crust pizzas (of course), and pretty decent entrees and appetizers as well.  Our event had us sampling several different dishes, and we ordered a few different drinks (all were good!) Anyways, highly recommend this place.  It was also a training night for some of the wait staff, so we'll have to see how things turn out.  I'm very hopeful and excited!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2
Julie T.,"San Marcos, United States",149,408,760,3.0,5/4/2017,"So let me start out by saying that I am not a contrary or belligerent customer. I will also point out up front that I had a very lovely experience at CPK. We took my daughter here to celebrate her making Student of the Month at her school. I've only been CPK once before and it was years ago in Hollywood, but I have great memories of the meal (and a nice Yelp review to look back on).  This Location inside the Westfield Mall is fairly new, so perhaps they are working out the kinks a bit. Our service was wonderful. The hostess sat us promptly, and our waitress was fast, friendly, and very accommodating. The Hubs and Wee One both had pizzas, which were delicious. The crust was crispy, the cheese tasted freshly grated, and the toppings seemed super fresh as well.  My only complaint is with my own food. I ordered the WILD MUSHROOM STROZZAPRETI. It was very tasty, and I did enjoy it, but...it cost nearly $16, and the portion was TINY TINY TINY!!! I mean like, a tennis ball sized portion.  Seriously, are they paying a professional mushroom hunter to source their criminis and white buttons? Was the butter in the sauce imported at great expense from the Basque region of the Pyrenees Mountains? Were the noodles hand-made by Jesus Christ himself?!? I have been a chef for over 20 years: Pasta and mushrooms cost almost nothing. What's wrong with giving your customers an actual entrée portion? Because I feel like that dish should be served as a tapas style appetizer (for 1/3 the price), if that's the portion they're going to push.  So the take-away is this: If you're in the mall and jonesing for a pizza, give CPK a go. Just avoid the over-priced pasta. Next time I will be certain to take my own advice.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2
Megan L.,"San Diego, United States",43,4,3,3.0,18/11/2017,"This was my first visit to this location. I was not happily greeted by the hostess. I actually had to get her attention by asking a question and she seemed uninterested but happily directed me to the back of the restaurant to place my to go order. I was then greeted by a very happy waitress who took my order. I asked her about the Bianco FlatBread which she raved about stating that it was the ""freshest thing on the menu""! I ordered that and a large salad. She said it would be ready in about 10 mins and said we could leave and come back or stay and wait. I left and bought a purse at charming Charlie not too far from CPK and when I came back my meal was placed in the bag and I was sent on my way. I only live about 10 mins from the mall. I wouldn't say the flat bread was sitting too long but when I opened the box my gut tells me it had been sitting for quite some time. It also appeared to have been just thrown in the box....Which also seemed like it must have been used prior based on the fact that other names were written on it and scratched out...weird. Anyway, didn't eat the flat bread but the salad was good.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2

As well as what I mean to this city. My server Dan was truly one of a kind. And yet, there was more. For in this crisp time when the winds do shake the darling buds of  summer, the chef brought the grilled fired ribeye, and even added tender potatö finger-liengs that appeared to be harvested locally.The tenderness of the ribeye was not restrained. It was the fulfillment of my gustatory dreams, without the resentful pain that normally arises from wasting $26 at other subpar restaurants. I don't need any more pain. Hell, does anyone? In finality, I will say that my experience at The California Pizza Kitchens's was sublime and my treatment near that of a gladiator most decorated. But the street parking wasn't that great.

We ordered quite easy items....soup, salad and pizza and it really didn't take too long but nothing was very good.  The pizza dough had NO taste whatsoever...I think if my son ate the box it might have had more flavor. The chicken picata was way too thick, the key to that is it must be pounded thin. Any good cook knows how to prepare this simple dish. My salad was messy with large chunks of bleu cheese and chicken....who is teaching these people in the kitchen ?

How does she not know this before? Ordered Ice tea with sugar and she never brought the sugar and never brought the refill I requested. She also must have screwed up our order with the kitchen because my replacement salad was delivered alone and then about 5 minutes later our appetizer came out followed by everyone else's food about 5 minutes after that..

Cassandra B.,"Escondido, United States",1,8,2,1.0,11/8/2017,"Honestly, I used to work for CPK a little over a year ago. I understand when it's busy and you can't tend to your tables as much as you would like, but this was not the case. My husband and I decided to go to cpk for dinner after I had a rough week at work and sat out on there cool looking bar area for the first time. It took about 10 minutes for someone to actually greet us and I know that after working for cpk for almost two years that the servers or bartenders have 30 seconds to a minute to at least greet or interact with a new table. It was not busy at the time we sat down and I saw both bartenders look at us and basically ignore us. We were not greeted with bread, we had to ask for it. After our food was dropped, Brandon came by to offered Parmesan cheese for my husband's pasta and never came back to ask us how our food tasted. We sat there and sat there and saw both bartenders leave the bar area. No one was to be found when we needed boxes for our food and when Jordan came back to the bar he looked in our directions but never asked us if we were doing okay. After he closed out his customers at the bar then he decided to ask us if we were doing okay and my husband asked for boxes. We boxed up our own food and I think I recall cpk employees offering to box up the food for their guest. Jordan just gave us boxes and the check and I think that was the quickest thing that was done all night during our visit. It's a shame how bad this was because we really enjoy cpk but I don't think we will return.

Michelle K.,"San Marcos, United States",4,6,,1.0,5/1/2017,"I received a gift card from a coworker for the holidays and my boyfriend and I decided to eat there on January 2nd. We chose to eat out at the bar area as it was open seating. Our waitress Sam was very pleasant and kind but she was also the main bartender for the entire restaurant so I think she was having to do too many things at once, this review is not a knock on her personally. We were seated, drink order taken, food order taken and then it was all downhill from there. They were out of bread so we had to wait for the complimentary appetizer to arrive - not a biggie. Several more families and couples were seated after us and we started to notice that everyone that arrived after us was receiving their food. We only ordered a pizza and salad so nothing complicated. After about 30 minutes of waiting AFTER we had ordered our food I finally asked one of the servers (that was delivering another table of food to customers that arrived after us) if our food would be arriving soon as we had already waited a significant amount of time. She apologized, looked into it, and about 10 minutes later we finally received our food. This entire time our server, Sam, only checked on us once early on to see if we liked our drinks, never followed up to be sure we received our food and apparently didn't notice that all of her other tables had received their food. Still we did not complain, sometimes things happen at restaurants and we acknowledge it was probably just a mistake. Once she saw we had finally received our food she came over to check on us, mentioning she would have the manager come by to talk with us. The manager NEVER came by. Then it came time to pay. Remember I had a gift card for this restaurant and I had went onto the CPK website before we arrived, typed in the number, and received the balance. Good to go? Not so much. Sam tried to use the gift card, wouldn't swipe, typed in the numbers, received error message. This happened numerous additional times. Another server tried, then they tried another computer, then the manager tried, all times the card didn't work. Then the manager came to our table to ask about another form of payment. She inquired where the gift card was purchased, noting it was not one from their restaurants. It was a gift, how am I supposed to know. I brought up the information on the CPK website showing the number were valid and the amount of the gift card but she refused to try any further. It was obviously an error with their computers and not my gift card.  It was the tone and bitchiness of the manager and the accusatory nature of her grilling me about the gift card as if I was trying to run a scam on them or something that made me finally complain about the service we had received. Ultimately we paid with another form of payment, the manager took off 20% for my inconvenience, and we didn't leave a tip. Again, I don't blame Sam for the service issues - I believe she was having to do too much. A bartender for an entire restaurant shouldn't be made to also be server to the numerous tables in that area. I have worked customer service before and the manager failed us here. She was unapologetic, rude, and made her customer feel as though I was doing something wrong. For this reason we will never eat at that location again and CPK is one of my favorite restaurants. There are plenty of other restaurants to select at this location, choose one of those. Also to note that CPK customer service is horrible. I left a message and submitted a complaint on January 3rd that has yet to be acknowledge even though I received a general email notifying me they received my feedback and would be contacting me.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2?start=40

After being seated, I ordered a salad and my friends split a pizza and gave me a slice, and it was good. Not the best pizza I've ever tasted, but it wasn't bad either, just average. I think it needed a bit more sauce and maybe oregano or some spice. We also had to ask the busser to help us during our dinner because the waiter had faded away. We wanted to order desserts but by the time the server came back we had waited too long and decided to leave.

Next, the food was much better than other CPK's, showing that the chef and the cooking staff are a cut above. From the succulent Roasted Vegetable to the delicious Moroccan Chicken, their salads rock. The Mahi Mahi tacos and the artichoke dip were delicious. And the mango guava coolers were tasty. Man! I thought I knew CPK... mind blown.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2?start=40
Elizabeth R.,"Escondido, United States",16,57,116,3.0,23/12/2016,Pizza was o.k. It was not amazing. Service was okay. We were left with empty drinks for a little while. Pizza was a medium size at Dominos.  Bill was $58 and at the end they didn't want to take my gift card.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2?start=40
Victoria G.,"Escondido, United States",54,2,,5.0,27/2/2017,"Well i work in the mall and it is really close. I absolutely love it there and their food is amazing. My favorite would have to be their bbq chicken pizza with bacon on it. And their salads are huge! They have a great lunch deal monday through friday from 11-4. their soups are delicious as well, chicken tortilla is sooo good. Also they have happy hour Monday- Thursday I'm not sure of the earlier time but the second half is from 8-close which is perfect because i can get off work and go over and have a drink while i wait for my ride. Definitely one of my favorite places to go.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2?start=40

PS J.,"Valley Center, United States",0,4,3,5.0,30/12/2016,"3rd time eating at this newly opened CPK and while there were some errors with our order and we had to wait for some of our items longer than usual, the Manager Cheryl Klewicki did right by us taking care of our lunch and dessert for the boys and inviting us back for another meal.

Deb B.,"Escondido, United States",0,1,,1.0,11/8/2017,"This place is horrible!  I've eaten at the Carmel Mtn location many times over the years and always been happy with food, service, etc.  The Escondido location was a huge disappointment.  The music inside is so loud you have to scream at each other across the table in order to have a conversation.  My friend and I asked our waiter if they could turn the music down a little so we didn't have to scream.  He had an ""attitude"" with us, but did say he would check.  We sat there for several more minutes and the music was still very loud.  When the waiter returned we asked about it again and the waiter was rude and walked away.  At that point we got up and left and ended up eating at a different restaurant in the mall. I will never go back to CPK  in Escondido!  The management needs to pay attention and realize most of their customers do not want extremely loud, blaring, rock music blaring in their ears when they are trying to enjoy a meal.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2?start=40
Martha M.,"Escondido, United States",3,6,1,1.0,21/2/2017,WORST service EVER!  If you want to call it service.  I took my son to celebrate his Birthday.  We sat there for 45 minutes while they brought the wrong order three times and never received our order. When we asked the server what's going on this is the third time were brought the wrong order?  She replies...  what was your order?  My son tells her at that time we hear her enter our order. We just walked out.  I WILL NEVER step foot at a CPK again. This was at CPK In Escondido Mall. Second time with terrible service but this time tops it....  NOT EVEN 1 star deserved,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2?start=40
Cj W.,"Temecula, United States",0,4,,1.0,2/3/2017,"After ordering meal, I never saw waiter again after drinks got dropped off.

Jake C.,"San Diego, United States",1,40,6,1.0,21/1/2017,"Slow service expected for new location. They have to get their feet wet. However we waited over 5 minutes with no server coming to our table. It was not busy. We ordered a custom pizza, pizza with white sauce. 25 minutes later the server tells us that pizza isn't allowed by management. After asking for the manager, Jose, he went on to explain why that pizza can't be ordered and offered no proper alternative for us nor did he care we were walking out. A disgrace as a Manager. Unfortunately every CPK is about the same. Food court never lets us down. Don't waste your time here.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2?start=40
R A.,"Escondido, United States",0,43,,5.0,29/11/2016,"So I've read other reviews about poor customer service and food quality at other locations. I have been to this location twice and I have had nothing but an amazing experience both times!!!  I REALLY hope that the quality of service continues after the ""grand opening"" time frame.  Our servers have been Angelina and Shawna. Both of them were absolute sweethearts and were so friendly. Bryan pitched in and helped and he was an absolute doll. So happy with our service.  I've had the chicken fettuccine Alfredo and the BBQ chicken salad with baked potato soup. Both delicious!!! Other people at my table ordered the carne asada pizza, Thai chicken salad and Hawaiian pizza. Absolutely no complaints and they devoured their meals. The Butter Cake is AMAZING!!!! Save room for it!!!!! Great experience!!!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2?start=60

Michelle D.,"Escondido, United States",0,3,,3.0,9/12/2016,"So my experience with cpk I felt was interesting...the food was good the servers I did not like at all. I have worked in restaurants for years and these servers are super lazy. Now the fact that I noticed you guys had one busser I believe his name was William he is the fastest I have ever seen. But, i witnessed a couple of servers walking around with a whole bunch of dishes and trying to force them into his bus tub. I don't know about cpk but I thought you guys were supposed to be a family environment. When in reality it was uncomfortable. My server was a tall dirty blonde that thinks she is the shit. When I go out to restaurants I like to feel at home and comfortable not feel like I'm at a rave or in high school for that matter. My main question here is why is William a busser and not a server if he worked in my resturaunt he would definitely be promoted. Cpk should watch their back...because with a hard worker like William some big cooperation is going to steal him from you. Also I think it's really sad that the only one that impressed me in that resturaunt was a busser you guys at cpk should definitely get a handle on your employees. If I need my bussers to get trained well I will bring them to cpk to watch a pro and that was William great job young man!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2?start=60
Joy T.,"Ramona, United States",1,5,9,5.0,29/11/2016,We went to the California pizza kitchen in Escondido it was actually their first real day went at lunch time. Our server was terrific her name was christina. Food was very good and Christina was very friendly.  It looked like they had a lot of upper management there.  One suggestion calm down. Our server Christina brought our ice tea mine was peach my husbands was raspberry. Christina started to take our order when a female floor manager came over grabbed the teas from our table said they weren't done right then made the poor girl bring back ice teas that the floor manager remade which were wrong she the manager brought us back regular ice tea and yelled at Christine Christine came back and apologized we told her she was fine.   For Christine and food 5 stars. For the manager 1 star. If I want more ice I would have asked for it. For your info we were there just before noon,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-escondido-2?start=60
