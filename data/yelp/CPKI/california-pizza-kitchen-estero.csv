Mike E.,"Fort Myers, FL",60,65,9,3.0,12/8/2012,"For a corporate chain, this is probably the best CPK I've been too.  The service has always been good, and the portions are always big.  I usually go for the salads, as they are huge and filled with goodness.  I did see a manager scolding an employee in public, and my 3 stars, is for you mr. manager.  I'm not a career coach, but being unprofessional in front of your customers is unappetizing.  Felt bad for the girl too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-estero?start=60
Erin C.,"Lakeland, FL",6,31,1,4.0,5/10/2013,"This is your typical pizza-pasta causal chain dining experience. My favorite is the club egg rolls. They were delicious, and seem to always be when we go to CPK. The service was great, we had no trouble getting refills before we needed them. We took our niece their for her birthday, she enjoyed the food and was able to take plenty of pizza back to her dorm room.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-estero?start=60
S. M.,"Nicholasville, KY",0,2,,4.0,7/6/2012,"We really liked the pizza here.  Crust is crispy and toppings good.  It was a little pricey, but not more than expected.  My drink off the menu was $9 (guess that's why the price wasn't listed).

Michael T.,"Cape Coral, FL",0,7,2,4.0,2/7/2011,"Nice clean joint. Have only tried the pizza, always good. A bit pricey for a pizza for one, but it's a nice size and it's worth the money if you ask me. I  recommend CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-estero?start=60
Bonnie G.,"Muskegon, MI",5,102,,4.0,3/1/2008,"I've had their bbq chicken pizza before and, even as I write this, I'm jonesing for it.  However, today I tried the classic chicken waldorf salad which contained greens, grapes, gorgonzola cheese, candied walnuts, apples, celery and, I think there was some chicken in there.  Needs more chicken.   4 -5 bites is definitely not enough.  That said, it sure was delicious.  Service was attentive and place has a nice, fun vibe.   April 7,2008  Second visit.  Liking this place more and more and maybe it'll get 5 starts some day.  Maybe.  Today I enjoyed the chopped salad with greens, turkey, mozzarella, salami, garbanzo beans and a nice mild dressing.  Half salad was plenty -- this from a woman with a very healthy appetite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-estero?start=60
Samantha S.,"Fort Myers, FL",8,36,5,4.0,2/15/2010,"CPK has a casual, clean atmosphere that small parties or large groups can enjoy.

Laura B.,"Naples, FL",310,134,401,5.0,8/4/2017,Omg one of my favorite pizza parlors ever their pizzas are to die for.  Mom and I shared the Hawaiian Pizza it was very good we had a great waitress and she was very good to us,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-estero
Caline M.,"Gainesville, FL",16,50,11,2.0,12/16/2016,"An extremely mediocre dining experience. The waitress was friendly, but clearly wanted us in and out as quickly as possibly, which is never how you want to feel when you're trying to enjoy a meal with friends!  I ordered the half order of the Moroccan spiced chicken salad with the dressing on the side. I ordered it because was attracted to the beets and the squash and the dates. I wish they had just kept it at that. Instead, they also pile on cranberries and eggs. Excessive and not well thought out. Less is more CPK!!! I also got a random grape in my salad, along with peanuts... this salad is only supposed to come with almonds, so just throwing other nuts in there makes it seem very messy. I was not pleased. The lettuce was fine, the chicken was also fine. This experience gives me no reason to ever come back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-estero
Pamela F.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,441,624,4.0,5/16/2016,"I've loved this place since I discovered it in the San Francisco Peninsula in 1996.

My daughter actually asked him to sit down and join us (which obviously couldn't happen as he was on the clock). He went above and beyond as a waiter and was so well informed on the menu.

Jay W.,"Vancouver, WA",24,642,605,2.0,1/20/2016,"We love a good pizza and it had been a long time since we had visited a CPK.  While at the mall, we decided to stop for an early dinner.  The restaurant is very nice, clean and inviting.  There were plenty of servers getting ready for the dinner crowd but the restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived.  We had no wait to be seated or for our order to be taken. We ordered a couple ice teas and an Hawaiian pizza with a thin crust.  The pizza was good but the ingredients were very sparse.  There were hardly no scallions, very little pineapple and the ham pieces were few and far between.  Obviously, CPK is not the place to order a pizza.  We've had much, much better almost every place else.  Considering  the size of the pizza and the ingredients, it was pretty expensive for what we got.   Service was ok.  I received a refill on my tea but my husband never did.  This  place does serve a lot more than pizza and that's probably what we should have ordered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-estero
Lydia H.,"Winthrop, NY",68,91,119,5.0,3/2/2017,I had actually never eaten at a California Pizza Kitchen and with it being a chain I didn't have high expectations. I was pleasantly surprised.

Then we ordered dinner, I ordered my son a mush/pepp/saus pizza but no mushrooms. We received our food and still no egg rolls. Then my sons food had mushrooms on it. I told the waitress we never got our egg rolls and then she asked, Do you still want them? that was the only reason I went there because I love the egg rolls.

Barrett B.,"Lehigh Acres, FL",40,98,455,2.0,10/21/2015,"Delicious. I mentioned on a review of Pizza 2000 in left Myers fl that gourmet and pizza doesn't go together, I was wrong obviously. It depends on who does gourmet and CPK has it. The only issue was the presentation of the salad and our run of the mill get your food and pay me college student with no personality but I owe it to the fact that they were almost at capacity.  If I had a pen for the place it would be like this: Oh CPK, you had me at pizza, not at hello.  The waitress was a mess But the food was not so so. I enjoyed the bite so much That I took it home and ate the last slice The same night :-) 10/21 edit  Tonight's stunk soo badly. I don't know what happened but the pizza was bad.

Philip S.,"Manchester, United Kingdom",84,154,1654,3.0,3/31/2015,"California Pizza Kitchen, Coconut Point Mall, Estero FL I love pizza, and I will probably blog a lot about how much I love pizza, and the first day staying at Hyatt Regency Coconut Point in October 2014, we decided to eat at California Pizza Kitchen before we browsed the shops at the Coconut Point Mall. The place looked great, nice interior and we sat outside on the terrace, which had a nice view of the outer side of the mall. The menu had lots to choose from and a big variety of pizzas and pastas. Even gluten free pizzas. I ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza and my girlfriend ordered the White Pizza (if I remember correctly!) and for starters (or entrée) we ordered Asparagus & Arugula Salad as we had a voucher for a free entrée when signing up to receive the CPK newsletter. The pizzas were nice, although, I wish I ordered a pizza with a flat thin base as I am no longer fond of the big crust pizzas. However, they are freshly made and have a great variety. Overall, I think the price is a little much for the quality. Like I said, I love pizzas and I have tasted better for less.

It seems they raised the prices over the past year too so I'm getting less food and paying more and the fact they tried to camouflage it by changing plates is insulting to my intelligence.The salads used to be very filling, but now I left hungry and paid $15 for a salad....I'm going to Panera!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-estero

Amanda G.,"Cape Coral, FL",0,12,1,1.0,10/6/2017,"This is not my first time here. While the food is amazing and full of flavor, what I seen on my visit yesterday was disturbing. I'm not sure if we will return...at least not anytime soon. While wrapping things up, there were roaches(multiple) on the booth seating where I was sitting. They kept coming onto the booth and then climbing where the uplighting is against the wall. When I walked up to the server and told her, she didn't seem surprised. I refused to sit back down. The mgr came to me, and mentioned ""I'll make sure we have pest control come out asap."" My response was ""it makes me wonder what I may have eaten in my food."" Not offered any incentive for the situation (discount or coupons for a next purchase - which I probably wouldn't have accepted) it would have been the gesture that meant more. Showing me that they were sincerely sorry, he just stated ""I can assure you my kitchen is spotless, but I can assure you that I will contact for pest control to come and treat."" This is completely unacceptable....very unfortunate for them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-estero

Fresh and crunchy, have them add avocado and you are set. Two people can barely eat a full sized order. With the chewy bread and herbed olive oil, this place was a great stop on a long shopping day.

We asked to talk to the manager, took a while for him to respond to us. Told us the orders were coming in as ordered. When I told him that our order was ready except for one item. He left, never came back, and the young lady was again left to fend for herself.

We asked our waiter to relocate us.  All this happening over twenty minutes while waiting for a pizza.  Once we were relocated it seemed as thought the waiter forgot about us.  We were never offered refills on our water, and waited another twenty minutes before our pizza finally arrived.  The crust was over done and tasted dry and tasteless.  We noticed others had returned their pizzas because the crusts were burnt. We did not see the waiter for another twenty minutes when he finally arrived with the bill.  Fifteen minutes passed before he returned to our table to pick up the payment.

Lisa S.,"North Fort Myers, FL",3,13,3,2.0,8/19/2015,"I definitely had higher expectations of this place-as most restaurants at Coconut Point Mall are very good. They were way over priced- we ordered take-out- got two pizzas and an order of the Carnitas taco meal. We spent about $40- which would have been fine if the food blew me away. But the pizzas were tiny- 10"" personal pizzas- we didn't order the thin crust- thank goodness- because the regular crust was already way too thin. My daughter and I usually love the crust- this was not good at all. The toppings were very skimpy- we ordered 1 cheese- and there was hardly any cheese on there. In addition to that- it wasn't even good quality cheese- it was greasy and didn't melt consistently. The other pizza we ordered was sausage, pepperoni and mushroom.  Also, not very good. The carnitas tacos were supposed to be slow roasted pork- the pork was bite sized crispy pieces of what tasted like mystery meat. And there was no cilantro, although they were supposed to have it on top. It was two tacos, served with chips and salsa- the chips tasted stale. I have to say I was not at all impressed. The reason I'm giving two stars instead of one is because the service. It was fast, friendly and efficient. Unfortunately that's not enough to cover the food quality and the price. I will not be going back. If you want pizza- Tony Saccos is in the mall as well, and their pizza is delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-estero?start=40

I wish they had just kept it at that. Instead, they also pile on cranberries and eggs. Excessive and not well thought out. Less is more CPK!!! I also got a random grape in my salad, along with peanuts... this salad is only supposed to come with almonds, so just throwing other nuts in there makes it seem very messy. I was not pleased.

We ordered a couple ice teas and an Hawaiian pizza with a thin crust.  The pizza was good but the ingredients were very sparse.  There were hardly no scallions, very little pineapple and the ham pieces were few and far between.  Obviously, CPK is not the place to order a pizza.  We've had much, much better almost every place else.  Considering  the size of the pizza and the ingredients, it was pretty expensive for what we got.   Service was ok.  I received a refill on my tea but my husband never did.  This  place does serve a lot more than pizza and that's probably what we should have ordered.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-estero

Not offered any incentive for the situation (discount or coupons for a next purchase - which I probably wouldn't have accepted) it would have been the gesture that meant more.

The chips that came with the spinach artichoke appetizer were stale and lacking any flavor. I didn't even taste any salt on them. The food passable, the service abysmal. Sat for 10 minutes before someone came to get our drink order. Restaurants need to understand there is a lot of competition out there and if you can't treat your customers right you will lose business. I can occasionally overlook a meal that isn't just so but when it comes to service it should be top notch.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-estero?start=20

Les S.,"Northfield, United States",0,95,19,2.0,10/3/2016,We have been to California Pizza Kitchen's twice that I remember. Not impressed with either location. I guess it is just not my wife and my type of pizza. We will not return. There was nothing really wrong with our food just nothing really pleasing (to us).

Gloria S.,"Naples, United States",383,818,2380,2.0,1/9/2012,"Menu had more choices than I expected for a Gluten Free Veggie person. Still no GF Pizza. Prices too high for what you get and the service was secretly rude. The server put on a fake sweetness while her words were stabbing rude.

Patty O.,"Naples, United States",0,18,,2.0,22/2/2014,"Good pizza but service problems cancel out the enjoyment of the meal. One order was completely forgotten. Other order was wrong item.

First of all, CPK is great to work with for fundraisers and donate 20% to non-profits for a certain day when people bring in a flyer. We had a great server, named Lexi, and she blew our minds when we couldn't decide between two pizzas and she said you can have a pizza split with both toppings! It was such a great decision! And our waitress suggested the butter cake. Best. Decision.Ever. It's not something I would picked from the dessert menu, but it was fantastic!

Pam S.,"North Fort Myers, United States",0,13,1,4.0,5/4/2012,Salads are pretty good.

Lisa S.,"North Fort Myers, United States",3,13,3,2.0,19/8/2015,"I definitely had higher expectations of this place-as most restaurants at Coconut Point Mall are very good. They were way over priced- we ordered take-out- got two pizzas and an order of the Carnitas taco meal. We spent about $40- which would have been fine if the food blew me away. But the pizzas were tiny- 10"" personal pizzas- we didn't order the thin crust- thank goodness- because the regular crust was already way too thin. My daughter and I usually love the crust- this was not good at all. The toppings were very skimpy- we ordered 1 cheese- and there was hardly any cheese on there. In addition to that- it wasn't even good quality cheese- it was greasy and didn't melt consistently. The other pizza we ordered was sausage, pepperoni and mushroom.  Also, not very good. The carnitas tacos were supposed to be slow roasted pork- the pork was bite sized crispy pieces of what tasted like mystery meat. And there was no cilantro, although they were supposed to have it on top. It was two tacos, served with chips and salsa- the chips tasted stale. I have to say I was not at all impressed. The reason I'm giving two stars instead of one is because the service. It was fast, friendly and efficient. Unfortunately that's not enough to cover the food quality and the price. I will not be going back. If you want pizza- Tony Saccos is in the mall as well, and their pizza is delicious.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-estero?start=40

Pat M.,"Fort Myers, United States",0,5,,2.0,21/4/2015,"Atmosphere is nice. Two visits in one week. Ordered gluten free pizza the first time.the crust was good. It really fell short in how skimpy the cheese and sausage were on the pizza. I order without the pepperoni and think I had 3 tiny pieces of sausage in 1/2 pizza. The second visit ordered 1/2 Cobb salad and found the same problem very little chicken, perhaps a half oz. my friends noticed the same problem with the salads  they ordered.

Noelle H.,"Alameda, United States",750,762,2779,3.0,11/3/2011,"It's CPK, meaning it's a chain, meaning the food is always going to taste the same.  I usually only get the miso shrimp salad or the vegetable pizza from here, but both are good.  The service has always been average and nothing more.  If you're craving some funky pizza flavors or good salads after a day of shopping in Coconut Point, go to CPK.  It's quick food that doesn't taste like junk food.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-estero?start=40
