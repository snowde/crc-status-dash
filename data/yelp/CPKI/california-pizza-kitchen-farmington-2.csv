Chou T.,"Avon, CT",3,6,6,4.0,12/4/2017,Really nice place and the food was awesome!  I ordered the jambalaya and it was delicious.  Service was timely and everyone was really kind to help us.  Definitely would come back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-2
Victoria H.,"Glastonbury, CT",172,27,63,3.0,6/29/2017,"I typically don't like the idea of giving bad reviews to restaurants because as a waitress I understand how experiences can differ person to person but I left California Pizza kitchen just really unhappy with the money I spent and the food I had ate.  I really think the only thing you should order here is pizza, hence the name. But I decided to try something that wouldn't be so heavy so I went with the Banh mi bowl which has about 15.59? It was skimpy and barely had any chicken. I'm pretty sure I bit on a small rock that was in my dish at some point or sand also. Felt literally like a bunch of raw vegetables thrown into a bowl with some chicken and a handful of quinoa. Bill came out to 17.44 with tip (service was mediocre at best). Way too pricey for the quality of food I ate. Not sure if I'll be returning except maybe to give their pizza a chance to redeem their sad excuse for a Banh mi bowl.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-2
Abram M.,"New Britain, CT",58,43,110,5.0,3/6/2017,"California Pizza Kitchen is totally awesome. I hadn't been there in a LONG time, and the last time I went I was sick with terrible cold, including post nasal drip and a stuffy nose.  So, I literally couldn't taste much.  Yesterday my wife and I decided to pick up some pizza to go. We didn't really have time to sit down, but she had some sort of rewards from CPK so we wanted to use it.  Their online menu doesn't have any prices so my wife used a third party app to figure out how much things cost. My wife said that when she went inside the price was higher than expected. She asked why and they told her what the price of the pizza was higher than what we read online.  The young woman helping her called over the manager, my wife explained that the third party app was wrong, but also it's hard to order online because CPK doesn't have prices. The manager, was very kind she said, he honored her 10 dollars rewards and then put the remaining balance on the house so we can get our pizza free.  My wife said he was very kind and understanding through the entire conversation and I feel like that is GREAT customer service! ON TOP OF THAT, the Jamaican jerk pizza we ordered was SO SO good.  My only tip to CPK is that they REALLLLYYYY should have their prices online. I understand it's a chain, so that is likely an issue that would have to be fixed by corporate or something.  However, that does not change my rating of this California pizza; this California pizza is awesome. I remember the service being good the last time I came, and that's coming from someone who felt pretty miserable that day because I was so sick.  CPK is great, and if you haven't been there already, you should definitely go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-2
Adriana C.,"Canton, CT",0,3,,2.0,12/10/2017,I place a take out order last night and have to say that the service was outstanding...fast response and delivery curbside because was snowing and the manager came out and gave me the food at my car!!! I really appreciated that gesture since I worked the whole day and didn't want to walk outside in the cold snowy weather!!! Arrived home 20 min later to enjoy the Hawaiian pizza and California Cobb but was very disappointed..crust was chewy and the sauce was not what I expected on both selections. The bacon was super hard and very little chicken! I ended feeling that was not worth what I paid! Not planning to visit or order again from this place!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-2
Paul B.,"Somers, CT",269,314,333,2.0,9/24/2017,"First visit to this his location 3rd time to cpk.  This location was extremely slow and our waiter was very hard to find. At one point the manager had to refill our drinks.  So the service was subpar for sure. The restaurant was busy but not insane so this really shouldn't have been an issue. I ordered the fish tacos and my daughter ordered a salad. She said her salad was good, but my tacos lacked any real flavor and were rather disappointing.  I've learned from the 3 visits here to stick to the pizza. Hopefully next time the service is better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-2
Diego A.,"Farmington, CT",3,67,5,4.0,7/16/2017,A good visit. We ordered the fried mac and cheese. So good! It was my first time trying it; no regrets! Ordered a Margherita thin crust pizza and regular cheese pizza for my boyfriend. Both tasted great. We skipped the desert because we were full. But was definitely worth it. Only slight downside was that the bread was a little bit hard...maybe too hard for my taste but it was still delicious. And filling of course. Our waiter was nice. Haven't been here in years and I liked the new look a lot. More modern. Will have to come back to try the bbq chicken sandwich. Sounds amazing. Until next time!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-2
Kelly H.,"Bristol, CT",4,24,14,4.0,5/12/2017,"We went here yesterday for lunch during a trip to the mall. Service was a little on the slow side, but I understand it was lunch hour. We did see others get their lunches before us, however, even though they were seated well after us. All we had ordered was 3 appetizers to share. Nothing crazy. They did bring us additional bread and dip with apologies for the slower than normal service. Although I have had the pizza previously, yesterday I had a craving for the avocado egg rolls and chicken lettuce wraps (which I think are the best around). My husband usually get the petite wedge salad no matter what. Food was good, no complaints there. Will definitely go back, but maybe not during rush lunch hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-2
Vicki B.,"Tolland, CT",66,358,1076,4.0,5/27/2016,"The roasted vegetables salad was magnificent. I added salmon to mine; the chef got it right leaving a little pink. The vegetables were roasted and warm a nice juxtaposition to the cool greens and avocado. I think the artichokes were canned as they tasted a little briny. Will omit those next time.  Group of six and the waitress (nursing student can't remember her name sorry) was not only friendly but efficient.  Had spring rolls, humus, and spinach dip appetizers, all were hits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-2
Dawn O.,"East Hartford, CT",231,233,630,3.0,4/9/2016,"Ya, It's a chain and the half portions can sometimes be inconsistent but if ya stick with the popular selections you usually can't go wrong.   I love the BBQ Chicken Salad and the White Bean Hummus with those fresh and Hot little doughy triangles to dip into it.  I only go here if we are shopping in the mall.  It can tend to be busy so you might have to wait a bit but the servers are sweet and have always been nice to us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-2

Ashwin S.,"Wethersfield, CT",228,265,1402,2.0,3/7/2016,"California Pizza Kitchen has been my favorite place; I am a big fan of their thin crust pizzas and the avocado club rolls. The ambience and the service has always been good too. The thin crust pizza's are an absolute delight, lite and crispy and saves you from the guilt of all the cheese of a regular pizza :) I ask for a side of the southwest ranch with the spring rolls to give it a little heat, they go well. The service has always been good too, the waiters/waitress are always very friendly and helpful in recommending or giving you insights into their specials.  I was disappointed with my visit today and hence the two star rating. The silverware that was given to us (me and my partner) was so dirty and had food remains on it; looked like it was not washed properly. We were given replacements when we mentioned it to the waitress, but I'd expect that things like this are take care of.  I will definitely try this place again and update my review after.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-2
Emily C.,"Hartford, CT",2705,1014,5259,3.0,2/16/2017,"Good for a quick lunch meeting or as a solution to combat mall hunger (ugh, mall hunger - the worst!). The half salad/lunch pizza combo is the perfect portion although the pizzas tend to be pretty salty & greasy. Flavorwise, you can't go wrong with the Thai pizza or BBQ chicken pizza! The salads are also very tasty but so highly caloric that you might as well just get the pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-2
Leonardo D.,"Newington, CT",40,86,224,4.0,2/3/2017,"My fiancee's and I are regulars here. We always stick to soups, salads and pizza's; my favorite is the pear and Gorgonzola with a side of white truffle oil; but you can't go wrong either of their pizza choices. I've recently tried one of their pasta's dish and it was pretty good, but I wouldn't rave about it. Service is good, except on busy days it can get a bit slow because of mall crowd. They have Chimay beer. YES! If you haven't tried it you must.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-2
Jon C.,"Bristol, CT",169,9,2,2.0,8/26/2017,"So upon entering the establishment we were seated fairly quickly, unfortunately as we sat down we were provided with dirty silverware. For something that was supposed to be a quick in and out bite to eat, it turned into over an hour with my partner never receiving a refill for the water that she asked for. It's not like the place was busy either, it just seems that our waiter forgot about us. The food was alright nothing super special but don't think I will be going back any time soon",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-2
Gia C.,"Houston, TX",112,143,234,5.0,1/3/2016,"I haven't been to California pizza in like 10+ years, but decided hey why not?  I recall I liked it, But at the same time prayed it was as good as I recall.  Cause a lot of stuff I use to like, I wonder why I did?  Did they change or did my taste preferences change? We arrived around 6-7 and it was a 10-15 mins wait even if the front looked like a chaotic mess of people.  Cause if it looked like that at Cheesecake Factory, expect 1-2 hour wait. Ordered Guac and chips for appetizer, original bbq  chicken pizza and added bacon for a few bucks more, plus the rib eye?  Prime rib?  There's like only one steak like dish so you will know, it came w potato shaped like chubby fingers and arugula.  Both exceeded my expectations.  I asked for medium rare, Hoping they wouldn't over cook it and they didn't disappoint.   I love Guac and it was nicely presented but I prefer it in a paste or cream form rather than diced and bean and corn in it, my suggestion to the place, serve it mashed. Had this strawberry lemonade type cooler was good too.  Said it had all this mango or some other fruit in it but not sure if i tasted all that fake/concentrated fruit mixture. My tip for food:  take a piece of the finger potato, fork a piece of cheese and bacon from your pizza...and you have an incredible baked potato in your mouth!!   Download free member ship or app.  Free small plate for now if you do it. Cpk:  bring back the duck pizza!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-2
Philip V.,"Rocky Hill, CT",24,1,,1.0,6/18/2017,"We have been very regular at this location for the past few years. Over the last couple months the food and the service has been going downhill. It's so bad that I have been forced to write a review while dining this time around. The Salad that we ordered have full vegetables, no one care to dice/ slice them. Not sure how I am expected to eat red onions without being cut properly. We had asked for salted Salmon but it didn't  come with the salad, Pizza was put on the table with any plates and there are other small things that all pile up to make a horrible experience. Takeout last week had a bad experience as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-2
Valerie R.,"Middletown, CT",202,415,1239,1.0,8/25/2015,"I haven't been to CPK in years and I could have gone without today's visit. Went for lunch and got a lunch duo of pizza and salad. The lunch duos are odd, there are only a few pizzas, soups, salads and sandwiches you can choose from. Some of the stuff isn't even on the regular menu. They have half sandwiches but you can't actually order just a while sandwich. You only get to combine two items from the sub-par offering of the lesser menu items...or you can order off the regular menu to get the ""good stuff"" and pay ridiculous prices. Either way is no win. I got the personal mushroom, pepperoni and sausage pizza with a Caesar salad. It was not worth 10.95. Pizza was all crust, I left a pile of crust carcasses on the plate, which took up the same surface area that the pizza had. The part with toppings was fine but was really about the size of one slice or less of actual pizza. The Caesar salad was gross. The cheese looked like it had been sitting out for a week and was all yellow. Who sees that and  still serves it?  One of my friends got baked potato soup and it was thick like glue. She scooped some on the spoon, flipped the spoon upside down and the soup stuck to the spoon. She said it looked like a can of condensed cream of broccoli soup before you add the liquid to it. Not appetizing. The worst part of it all is the server never asked how anything was, saw leftover food on our plates (including completely uneaten soup) and never asked if there was an issue. Probably because he knows the food is gross and doesn't want to hear it! For the money you can do better for lunch just about anywhere else in the area. I don't know if it's just this location or if it's the new menu, but this was not the CPK I used to know and love. I will probably never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-2
Nora W.,"Collinsville, CT",31,49,44,4.0,7/27/2016,"I am broken hearted from my experience today.  I have ordered the tortilla soup and 1/2 original chopped chicken salad 90% of the time I come to eat.  To my dismay, my soup really wasn't ""soupy"", it was very thick, I can let that slide.  My salad arrives, to my complete horror as I take the first bite, it was different, how was it different? Why was it making me sad?  They changed the chicken!!!! WHY? Why would they destroy something that was so perfect to begin with? They now have ""grilled"" chicken.  So if you enjoy burnt tasting chicken, enjoy!  I can honestly say, thanks CPK, I enjoyed our 15 year relationship, I will miss you terribly  As of July 26th, CPK haas heard my plight and Kevin the manager reached out to me to see if we could do something to make me happy...so if you want the original BBQ chopped salad and hate the new chicken, substitute with roasted turkey and all will be well again.  Thank you Kevin for being awesome",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-2

Julia W.,"Manchester, CT",227,200,417,4.0,4/14/2016,"Vegetarians, rejoice! I truly love that CPK never disappoints with their vegetarian options. From soups, to salads, to pizzas, I am always able to choose something I'm in the mood for -healthy or slightly more indulgent- that fits my dietary restrictions. Seems silly, but this is everything to those of us who usually have to play detective just to determine if we can even eat the seemingly vegetarian soup without ingesting chicken broth.

Steve G.,"Farmington, CT",0,2,,3.0,10/19/2017,"Went to dinner for my sons birthday, since this is my kids favorite place.  Unfortunately the service was extremely slow, it took over 45 minutes to get our meals.  Not particularly busy and plenty of staff on hand. We did ask the waitress to check our order, she was less than communicative.  She told us it would be another 5 minutes, it was another 15.  It came with no comment from the waitress about the amount of time it took for the food to come.  So just when we thought this trip was a total bust, the waitress returned, acknowledged the delay and comped us desert. Unfortunately it took so long for her to come back, we had to leave.  In the end a good part of our meal was comped and the manager sent us home with desert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-2?start=20

I really like the wine selection and they always have different seasonal cocktails which are fun to try.  This location eliminated my favorite meal- the healthiest option on the menu.

Wendy V.,"Newington, CT",12,16,9,2.0,4/12/2017,"For the price of the salad, i was expecting more. The salad was good, but the major ingredients were slim. I would give them another try, just because maybe the line cook/chef on that day was having a bad day, etc. I would hope when you order a salad with asparagus, goat cheese and asparagus, i would be able to taste in every bite, but it was mostly arugula.

My boyfriend & I had never been to California Pizza Kitchen before & decided to check it out since we were in the area. The waitress had a horrible attitude throughout our entire time there. We had ordered a pizza and a salad, which we did have some leftovers & asked to have them wrapped up. The waitress came back with one box. Puzzled, my boyfriend opened the box and found that the waitress had put the pizza in the box & dumped the salad on top of the pizza. When she came back with the check, she nonchalantly replied that she assumed we would have wanted our pizza & salad wrapped up together that way! Who throws salad on top of pizza?! The service was awful, the attitude from the woman was out of this world, & the to-go disaster was the icing on the cake for us. We won't be coming back to California Pizza Kitchen ever.

While it's not quite as special or unique as it was back then, they've done enough renovations and updates to their menu to keep it fresh. Recently went back to the new restaurant, which is brighter and has some bigger tables than before. Service was very good. Efficient and prompt -- which is what you want in a mall place.  As for the food, the spinach artichoke dip is our favorite comfort food, even if it probably has 1000 calories. The pizza crust seems to be updated (in a good way), but the BBQ chicken was a big hit with the oldest kid.  I enjoyed the sicilian thin crust. Big enough to split for sure.  And we liked the Torilla rolls too. And don't miss the Salted Caramel dessert. Yummy!  Overall, it's a solid chain restaurant and we'd come here again any day.

The drink I ordered, the Sparkling Cranberry Cooler, did not taste right with the lemon and lime; its much better without. That, and the table was wobbly throughout the entire evening.

The only reason I rated this establishment a 2 is because I often find the food tasty with fresh ingredients.  Moving on... The service was AWFUL to say the least. Our server was not attentive and at times rude. I have a small child and asked for crackers (which they do not even carry) to hold him over, but was told that she could offer bread. After fifteen minutes of waiting, my toddler was getting anxious and hungry. However, our server ended up going to two other tables (that came in after us) and bringing them bread before she brought us our bread to my now very upset two year old. There were four people at our table, but we received enough bread to feed two individuals at most!  The pizzas and check took another 50 minutes.  Finally, the prices are outrageous!

As for the wine flight, not so much. They tasted as if the wines have been opened for a while. We ordered the roasted veggies sautéed salmon salad and the Mahi Mahi tacos. Omygoodness. The salad was amazing. It had all my favorite veggies in them. Artichoke hearts, avocado, asparagus and etc. It was a feast in your mouth. This is definitely my new favorite salad and i shall forever order this salad whenever I dine here. The tacos were yummy as well. Overall the food was great.

The sundae is a decent size.. in fact the whole thing was a decent size that I might order off the kids menu going forward!

There was hardly any edamame in the salad and I would say the rice noodles they usually garnish the salad with were basically missing. It was basically a salad of chicken, cabbage and carrots.

She quickly made sure it was completed and then told her manager, who had the starter comped without a single complaint from us. The starter was great and worth waiting for.

A little disappointed as it just tasted like a ""normal"" salad from anywhere. The chicken also tasted precooked - boiled in salt water kind of texture. Wished that it was roasted in the awesome pizza oven.  So next time - back to the yummy foods on the small quantities menu. Not the enormous chop everything together salad.

As for the food, the spinach artichoke dip is our favorite comfort food, even if it probably has 1000 calories. The pizza crust seems to be updated (in a good way), but the BBQ chicken was a big hit with the oldest kid.  I enjoyed the sicilian thin crust.

I really think the only thing you should order here is pizza, hence the name. But I decided to try something that wouldn't be so heavy so I went with the Banh mi bowl which has about 15.59? It was skimpy and barely had any chicken. I'm pretty sure I bit on a small rock that was in my dish at some point or sand also. Felt literally like a bunch of raw vegetables thrown into a bowl with some chicken and a handful of quinoa. Bill came out to 17.44 with tip (service was mediocre at best).

I hadn't been there in a LONG time, and the last time I went I was sick with terrible cold, including post nasal drip and a stuffy nose.  So, I literally couldn't taste much.  Yesterday my wife and I decided to pick up some pizza to go. We didn't really have time to sit down, but she had some sort of rewards from CPK so we wanted to use it.  Their online menu doesn't have any prices so my wife used a third party app to figure out how much things cost. My wife said that when she went inside the price was higher than expected. She asked why and they told her what the price of the pizza was higher than what we read online.  The young woman helping her called over the manager, my wife explained that the third party app was wrong, but also it's hard to order online because CPK doesn't have prices. The manager, was very kind she said, he honored her 10 dollars rewards and then put the remaining balance on the house so we can get our pizza free.  My wife said he was very kind and understanding through the entire conversation and I feel like that is GREAT customer service! ON TOP OF THAT, the Jamaican jerk pizza we ordered was SO SO good.  My only tip to CPK is that they REALLLLYYYY should have their prices online. I understand it's a chain, so that is likely an issue that would have to be fixed by corporate or something.  However, that does not change my rating of this California pizza; this California pizza is awesome. I remember the service being good the last time I came, and that's coming from someone who felt pretty miserable that day because I was so sick.

They did bring us additional bread and dip with apologies for the slower than normal service. Although I have had the pizza previously, yesterday I had a craving for the avocado egg rolls and chicken lettuce wraps (which I think are the best around). My husband usually get the petite wedge salad no matter what. Food was good, no complaints there. Will definitely go back, but maybe not during rush lunch hours.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-2

Group of six and the waitress (nursing student can't remember her name sorry) was not only friendly but efficient.

Ashwin S.,"Wethersfield, United States",228,265,1402,2.0,7/3/2016,"California Pizza Kitchen has been my favorite place; I am a big fan of their thin crust pizzas and the avocado club rolls. The ambience and the service has always been good too. The thin crust pizza's are an absolute delight, lite and crispy and saves you from the guilt of all the cheese of a regular pizza :) I ask for a side of the southwest ranch with the spring rolls to give it a little heat, they go well. The service has always been good too, the waiters/waitress are always very friendly and helpful in recommending or giving you insights into their specials.  I was disappointed with my visit today and hence the two star rating. The silverware that was given to us (me and my partner) was so dirty and had food remains on it; looked like it was not washed properly. We were given replacements when we mentioned it to the waitress, but I'd expect that things like this are take care of.

Gia C.,"Houston, United States",112,143,234,5.0,3/1/2016,"I haven't been to California pizza in like 10+ years, but decided hey why not?  I recall I liked it, But at the same time prayed it was as good as I recall.  Cause a lot of stuff I use to like, I wonder why I did?  Did they change or did my taste preferences change? We arrived around 6-7 and it was a 10-15 mins wait even if the front looked like a chaotic mess of people.  Cause if it looked like that at Cheesecake Factory, expect 1-2 hour wait. Ordered Guac and chips for appetizer, original bbq  chicken pizza and added bacon for a few bucks more, plus the rib eye?  Prime rib?  There's like only one steak like dish so you will know, it came w potato shaped like chubby fingers and arugula.  Both exceeded my expectations.  I asked for medium rare, Hoping they wouldn't over cook it and they didn't disappoint.   I love Guac and it was nicely presented but I prefer it in a paste or cream form rather than diced and bean and corn in it, my suggestion to the place, serve it mashed. Had this strawberry lemonade type cooler was good too.  Said it had all this mango or some other fruit in it but not sure if i tasted all that fake/concentrated fruit mixture. My tip for food:  take a piece of the finger potato, fork a piece of cheese and bacon from your pizza...and you have an incredible baked potato in your mouth!!   Download free member ship or app.  Free small plate for now if you do it.

Valerie R.,"Middletown, United States",202,415,1239,1.0,25/8/2015,"I haven't been to CPK in years and I could have gone without today's visit. Went for lunch and got a lunch duo of pizza and salad. The lunch duos are odd, there are only a few pizzas, soups, salads and sandwiches you can choose from. Some of the stuff isn't even on the regular menu. They have half sandwiches but you can't actually order just a while sandwich. You only get to combine two items from the sub-par offering of the lesser menu items...or you can order off the regular menu to get the ""good stuff"" and pay ridiculous prices. Either way is no win. I got the personal mushroom, pepperoni and sausage pizza with a Caesar salad. It was not worth 10.95. Pizza was all crust, I left a pile of crust carcasses on the plate, which took up the same surface area that the pizza had. The part with toppings was fine but was really about the size of one slice or less of actual pizza. The Caesar salad was gross. The cheese looked like it had been sitting out for a week and was all yellow. Who sees that and  still serves it?  One of my friends got baked potato soup and it was thick like glue. She scooped some on the spoon, flipped the spoon upside down and the soup stuck to the spoon. She said it looked like a can of condensed cream of broccoli soup before you add the liquid to it. Not appetizing. The worst part of it all is the server never asked how anything was, saw leftover food on our plates (including completely uneaten soup) and never asked if there was an issue. Probably because he knows the food is gross and doesn't want to hear it! For the money you can do better for lunch just about anywhere else in the area. I don't know if it's just this location or if it's the new menu, but this was not the CPK I used to know and love. I will probably never go back.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-2
Nora W.,"Collinsville, United States",31,49,44,4.0,27/7/2016,"I am broken hearted from my experience today.  I have ordered the tortilla soup and 1/2 original chopped chicken salad 90% of the time I come to eat.  To my dismay, my soup really wasn't ""soupy"", it was very thick, I can let that slide.  My salad arrives, to my complete horror as I take the first bite, it was different, how was it different? Why was it making me sad?  They changed the chicken!!!! WHY? Why would they destroy something that was so perfect to begin with? They now have ""grilled"" chicken.  So if you enjoy burnt tasting chicken, enjoy!  I can honestly say, thanks CPK, I enjoyed our 15 year relationship, I will miss you terribly  As of July 26th, CPK haas heard my plight and Kevin the manager reached out to me to see if we could do something to make me happy...so if you want the original BBQ chopped salad and hate the new chicken, substitute with roasted turkey and all will be well again.  Thank you Kevin for being awesome",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-2

As for the wine flight, not so much. They tasted as if the wines have been opened for a while. We ordered the roasted veggies sautéed salmon salad and the Mahi Mahi tacos. Omygoodness. The salad was amazing. It had all my favorite veggies in them. Artichoke hearts, avocado, asparagus and etc. It was a feast in your mouth.

There was hardly any edamame in the salad and I would say the rice noodles they usually garnish the salad with were basically missing. It was basically a salad of chicken, cabbage and carrots.
