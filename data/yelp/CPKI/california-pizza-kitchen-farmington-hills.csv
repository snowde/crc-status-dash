Natalie D.,"Farmington, MI",23,13,4,2.0,11/6/2017,"My daughter and I were at Lululemon at 12 Oaks Mall and CPK had a table set up, where they were serving samples of their arugula & quinoa salad, as well as their corn & black bean guacamole. They were delicious, so we went downstairs to CPK for dinner to order the real deal. They were amazing!  Last night we were shopping at Hunter's Square and decided to stop at this CPK to order our new favorite salad and appetizer. We walked in and were greeted by the host, who offered to seat us (me ?) at the bar. I inquired about whether or not my 11yr old could sit at the bar, to which he replied ""no."" (So why are we discussing this? Lol!)  Our waitress took forever to come take our drink order. We placed our entire order, and she brought it all out together... Drinks included. Hmmm...  The guacamole was shaped like a small upside down cup. No effort at all to make it at least appear like it didn't come out of some sort of pre-packaged something. The avocado was in chunks... It was bizarre. Tastes the same, I suppose, but part of dining out is the presentation. The chips were stale. It was just bad.  The salad was just ok. Chicken added to it was fresh out of the microwave! Not impressed with this location. If I want CPK, I'm going back to the mall where they at least try!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-hills
Rashmi R.,"Farmington, MI",37,104,278,4.0,5/29/2017,If u want a guilt feee pizza... this is the place to visit.. their items on the menu make u feel more hungry as everything looks tempting... we had a late noon lunch in a weekend... the place wasn't too crowded and we were seated immediately ... we ordered crispy cauliflower it was fresh and tasted very good... I liked the way it was presented and also the dressing for it was delicious ..it wasn't too oily or soggy it was tender and crispy..a good substitute for chicken wings.. main course we had California veggie pizza and a mushroom pasta.. the ingredients on the pizza was very fresh and it wasn't layered wit extra unhealthy cheese like how other places prepare a pizza the size of it was also good to share or to have it as a whole....it was baked well and wasn't too heavy on the stomach wch makes u feel less guilty  the mushroom pasta was the best amongst all the pasta was soft and cooked well it tasted fresh and loved the way the whole dish was made... amount of Parmesan cheese and garlic were just perfect and  made the whole dish delicious... it was a very generous portion...  overall a nice place to have a good meal wit less guilt,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-hills

Jody K.,"Waterford Township, MI",45,234,190,2.0,11/22/2015,"I have never been impressed with California Pizza Kitchen. I find it overpriced for what you get, and the service is just fair. The food isn't bad, but nothing to write home about, either. We went there on the first cold, snowy Sunday night of the season -- and they had no heat! We didn't realize it until after we'd ordered (we thought we were just cold from being outside), but then, we noticed other patrons sitting in their coats. We asked the server, and she basically said that they're aware of it. She apologized, but no offer of warm beverages or compensation of any kind. I decided to get the two in a bowl soup. I'd wanted the split pea with barley and the squash, but they were out of the squash, so I got potato. It arrived in a GIANT rimmed dish -- with a tiny, shallow bowl. it looked pretty, but it was literally 2 soups side by side in the same bowl, nothing separating them. And there wasn't much soup; probably not much more than a cup or cup and a half. It didn't come with bread or crackers or anything else.  And the dish it was in was stone cold. The pea soup was warm, but since the potato soup was hot enough, I didn't bother sending it back. For $8, it was not a good choice. My sister got the lettuce wraps & asked for additional lettuce and gave me some. It was pretty good, and my mom seemed to enjoy her flat bread. But again, nothing came with anything else. There are so many other places for Italian food, sandwiches & salads. While the ambiance there is nice, in my opinion, that's not enough to recommend it -- especially without heat in the winter!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-hills

Takes about 40 minutes for a pizza and can never get a refill on water.  What is even worse, if you sit anywhere by the restrooms you will be nauseated by the smell. When we asked to be moved to a different table, the waiter said, ""oh is it the smell?"" and we said yes! He acknowledged it and said, ""he was used to it so it doesn't bother him.""

We came here around 7 PM on a Saturday night and there was only a waiting list if you wanted to sit outside. Our waiter was really awesome! He was friendly and accommodating, he always made sure we all received refills and checked on us just the right number of times. I had the Jamaican Jerk Chicken pizza which has been my favorite for a LONG time. I'm not sure why it only comes as a thin pizza these days, I never asked but I would think it would be possible to get it as a deep dish if you really wanted. It was cooked exactly like I wanted, nice tasty crust, just the right heat level on the spices. I didn't even break out sweating, either it was perfect or I'm getting used to the higher heat level again :-) Everyone in our party thought the waiter was outstanding, he really made the experience a whole lot better.

The crust is on the thin side and the edges can get a little burned but over all the GF pizza is better than most. Great flavors and fresh ingredients. They also have a couple starters that are gluten free. My favorite is the guacamole and chips. It's avocado smashed with onion, corn, cilantro, and beans. It's really good.  The service has always been great. The only annoying thing about the place is the parents who allow their children to run wild through the tables. I also wish they had a gluten free dessert.

N P.,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",53,224,,4.0,12/18/2013,"4 stars for CPK in general so that's where my rating is.  But 3.5 stars for CPK in terms of service both at this location and 3 stars for service at the Troy location.   At this location, I've had to wait for what seemed like an eternity multiple times for carryout.  Also dining in is also slow but that could just be because of staffing issues.  The Troy location also has a long wait but that place always seemed busier.  At Troy, for whatever reason, our server ignored our empty water glasses and disappeared for long stretches of time.  I think she may have checked on us once to ask about our food.  Simply ordering pizzas and drinks should not take an hour-and-a-half on a weeknight toward the end of the night.    To be more positive, CPK as a chain has gone above and beyond for vegetarians and vegans by posting information about these options ( ).  They also have posted about allergen information ( ), gluten free options ( ), and nutrition information ( ).  OUTSTANDING.  I wish EVERY restaurant did this. Still, as noted on the website, there may be variations based on location so it is important to check with the server at each location.  At this location here in Farmington Hills at least they tried to help even though it took awhile.  I don't think there was any reference to these pdf lists though.  At Troy, I don't even think the server made an effort to help when I told her I was a vegetarian.  I ended up with a salad and no cheese there which is silly.  I wish I had known about this list. I do love CPK for posting this information on their website (Thank you CPK for acknowledging the vegetarians and vegans in the world lol)!  The food generally tastes great with nice combinations of toppings that taste pretty fresh (and with some creative toppings like pears) and a delicious crunchy crust.  I hope that service is better next time I visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-hills?start=20

Celestial P.,"Woodinville, WA",0,41,2,2.0,9/3/2012,"Pita-ful Policy: Can't a lady get a piece of bread around here? I went here for a dinner, and one of my dinner companions wanted a piece of bread to eat with her salad, just something to push the salad onto her fork.  Jenny, the waitress, informed her that they normally serve complimentary bread for free, but they were out of bread today. Instead she could buy 8 pieces of pita bread for a dollar.  She asked again if she could just have once piece? Jenny said no.  If she wanted bread, she'd have to buy a plate. Then she said that she didn't want it, on principle of the thing they should substitute accordingly and not charge her for a piece of bread.  The kerfuffle continued: should Jenny bring bread, and would she charge for it?  It was getting ugly. Another at our table insisted that she should bring the bread and he would pay the dollar. Nearly ten minutes passed before the pita bread arrived. In the meantime we asked ourselves why the waitress had brought four bread plates and distributed them around our booth if no bread was going to be given for them.  When Jenny arrived with the plate of pita bread, our salad lady asked, ""Did you ask the manager?  Jenny said no, she had not asked the manager. The bread would be charged. At the end of the meal, with a plate of 7 pieces of pita bread crowning the table, our salad lady asked the waitress, ""Did you charge for the bread?"" Jenny said yes, so she responded with, ""Well, then, I want to take it home with me.""  Whoa now, is anyone named Jenny paying attention? Customer is clearly still disgruntled. Would have been a good time to think of bringing the manager over, especially since the restaurant was now nearly empty of dinner crowd. Instead she brought a take-home box.

But not tonight. I started with a small plate appetizer of spinach and mushroom.  It was quite flat and tasteless.  Seem to lack seasoning.  They the pizza.  But the Pizza was horrible.  The chicken was in huge chunks, the extra onion and cheese was non-existent.  There was barely any cilantro on it.  It tasted like a train wreck (yes, like I made it myself).  I had hoped to cater a upcoming meeting at our health care firm here in Southfield with the best meeting meal I could think of.  I am afraid this is not it.    The service was good, but the kitchen staff did not back them up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-hills?start=20

Mark B.,"Orchard Lake, MI",1,25,,1.0,11/20/2010,"Nice bright, tastefully appointed decor; spacious table arrangement and an airy, open feel.   That's what earns this restaurant a single star.  Because the food is simply atrocious. We were there for lunch.  Ordered the Thai Crunch Salad, a thin crust pepperoni pizza and a bowl of schizo soup -- two kinds of soup in the same bowl.  Let's start with the soup.  The schizo idea is a good one.  That way, when one of the soups is just plain lousy, at least you've still got the other side that might make it nearly up to mediocre.  And only $6.00.  Hey, what a deal.  Two half servings of crappy soup in one bowl for twice the the price. The salad -- holy cow -- had raw peas, raw lima beans or some kind of legumes in it; bunch of crunchy white noodles and a few bits of chicken.   Nicely piled.  And definitely a pile.  Completely inedible.  Absolutely awful. Finally -- the crowning touch -- a pasty thin crust circle of something -- sorta like a big wet saltine -- with a smattering of cheese about a nanometer thick.  And at least 7 slivers of pepperoni strewn on top of the whole thing -- probably carefully placed in areas where there was no cheese at all.  You know, saves on the cheese.  Easily the very WORST example of Pizza I've ever seen.   And at only 13 or 14 dollars -- hardly a better way to get ripped off than this. Bottom line -- unbelievably bad.  Steer waaay clear of this place and I'm sure, every other Crapifornia Pizza Kitchen out there.  I promise I will. P.S. Reading the other review of this place and seeing the comment ""Reasonably priced"".  Could not be farther from the fact.  Over priced in fact.  Try and miss verifying this for yourself, though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-hills?start=20

Penny S.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",1,11,,2.0,9/20/2013,"So I think the food at CPK is very good, they have the best salads and although I think they're priced too high, they're still pretty darn good.  Today, I happened upon the Farmington Hills location.  I'm new in the area and when I saw the restaurant I was glad to know I'd soon be eating the Moroccan Chicken Salad.  I went to the Take-Out counter where I was greeted by a nice young woman, who was clearly frazzled and we told me she was new.  Okay, I get it...new typically equals frazzled.  No worries.  I order the salad and ask for bread on the side.  30 minutes later, after seeing my salad sitting on the counter for a good 10 of those minutes, I am handed the salad.  I reminded her about bread and asked for butter.  She looked at me like I had horns and then had to ask someone else where to get butter.  She must have been 1st day new.  I finally get back to work, open the package and find the salad had no dressing and that it wasn't on the side, either.  Heavy sigh. In the meantime, as I was waiting I was watching other servers, especially the woman making pizza and another of what appeared to be a ""seasoned"" server.  The pizza lady touched everything.  She handled the food with her bare hands, I watched her do it again and again.  The ""seasoned"" server was preparing a to-go drink for someone and help the cup at the rim, with fingers inside the cup.  She cut bread using her bare hands and then picked the bread up with a plastic baggie, I assume to not further handle it.  I just wonder who's managing, or in this case, not managing this restaurant.  It was not busy, even though I was there at noon and there is just no excuse for sloppy and gross handling of food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-hills?start=40
Kathryn L.,"Birmingham, MI",63,142,14,5.0,1/2/2012,This is a great location where you can walk to shops before/after you eat. The food here is great. The staff is phenomenal. My favorite aspect is the really cool ambiance -- breezy patio area or chic indoor space.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-hills?start=40
Bob S.,"Farmington, MI",0,24,,4.0,8/29/2011,"As others have said, the pizza's made here are thin crust, with a variety of specialty pizzas.   I always have the Sicilian, which is served with a variety of meats, including ham, sausage, and salami, a minimal amount of sauce, and a light dusting of cheese. Service was good and prices were reasonable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-hills?start=40
Carlos O.,"Ann Arbor, MI",173,45,15,3.0,5/15/2012,Service was a little slow during the afternoon. Had the California Club which was ok. Did not like how the lettuce was lated out and not much of bacon on the pizza. The best thing was the avocados. The honey wheat crust was good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-hills?start=40
Randy T.,"Hackettstown, NJ",29,213,3,4.0,12/3/2011,"CPK never disappoints. You can go to any CPK in any location and be almost guaranteed a great product. This is a great location for lunch during the week, and the outdoor patio is a big hit in the summer!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-hills?start=40
Nikki T.,"Detroit, MI",119,423,231,4.0,8/8/2008,"The best tasting pizza I've had in a while hands down! And the environment is the best! They have a menu that offers everything from salad to pasta dishes. The drink menu, both non alcoholic and alcoholic has a great selection as well. The restaurant is contemporary and some what intimate. That's what I said, especially with a name like California Pizza Kitchen. The restaurant is reasonable priced and the service was excellent. I recommend having the White Pizza which is thin crust with a blend of several cheeses with spinach. The best!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-hills?start=40
