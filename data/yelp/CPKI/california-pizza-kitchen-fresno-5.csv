Lesa W.,"Clovis, CA",5,33,7,5.0,5/8/2017,"Food and service are great!  Food is fresh and hot when it arrived to the table.  Server was attentive - just the right amount. The menu offers a variety of food/flavors to suit almost anyone at the table, from pizza to jambalaya to steak. Always a happy time here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fresno-5
