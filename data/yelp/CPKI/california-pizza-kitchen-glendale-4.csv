Daily W.,"Queens, NY",1,5,8,5.0,1/14/2018,I believe this should have five stars because the service is great and your kids won't be complaining until the food is served because their is crayons and paper for games and that would keep them occupied.The food looks so good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4
Ro A.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",1,56,1,1.0,12/27/2017,"How is this place still functioning ?  How ? I was here on December 24 in the afternoon doing the last minute shopping in atlas park when my daughter was a little hungry.  We went here and this Hispanic female  waitress was the worse ever I have seen.  I received the check and notice that new customers came in and this other waitress gives them bread with oil right away. When I later questioned my waitress about why didn't she serve us bread, her response was that they ran out of bread and that they had to go pick up , which  is a total lie.  Then I was waiting for her to pick up my check and I decided to go where the kitchen area is at because she was by the cashier .  I wanted my daughters food to go as well as my pizza .  This guy that works there took my daughters pasta and my pizza and put it in a pizza box.  How gross is that.  That was the most disgusting thing I ever saw in my life.  Not only did he do that, but my daughter had chicken in her pasta and I am a vegetarian.   He put everything all over the pizza box.   Gross and disgusting.  Also unprofessional.   This place has bad reviews and they should start looking into the manager here because apparently there is something wrong with this place.  Wake up manager.  Your doing a poor job",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4
Glenn V.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",1908,1126,1556,2.0,11/29/2017,"Having been given ye 'ole double thumbs up by a good friend with a bad palate, I pretty much had my expectations set -- and the settings were right. Petite Wedge is called a few different things at  various eateries, it seems that its the first word that changes, but Wedge word remains. I didn't really enjoy it unfortunately, Roma tomatoes - good, blue cheese - bad, if anything is anything -- lettuce is lettuce and it was and it was and I've no idea who Neuski is.  Being a lover of Thai food, the Thai Chicken Spring Tortilla Rolls really sounded good although I'm not a fan of the listed calorie intake model.  A bit too many sproutish greens, a little too little Thai Chicken was confined in their smallish Tortilla cocoon. The peanut sauce was quite good and I contemplated asking for a smattering to go. But after reflecting upon the slow and semi dismissive service, I thought it better to pay and leave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4
Robert B.,"Queens, NY",44,6,4,3.0,10/15/2017,I always enjoyed coming here but just had the worst pizza ever with very minimal toppings...for $15 you should be tasting the toppings in every bite. The service was lackluster at best the servers seem to be more interested in talking to each other than taking care of their guests. The best part of the whole diner was the desert but you really have to try to screw up desert. Prob won't dine here again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4
Milena M.,"New York, NY",144,68,120,4.0,11/21/2017,My husband and I went there around 9:30 pm to grab late dinner and even though the restaurant was closing at 10 pm they still took us in and served us. They seated us right away and were very kind. The waiter gave us enough time to look at our menus before he came to serve us. They greeted us with Bread and olive oil and water. Then they came up and let us order. We ordered the chicken garlic pizza and tomato basil soup. The soup was a little cold but I was not going to complain due to the fact that they were closing soon. I also ordered an orchid sangria which was so delicious! So try it if you are a wine drinker. Now the chicken garlic pizza was not bad but not the best I still like the Hawaiian better but my husband and I wanted to try something different! For a quick dinner cali pizza is the place to go!

Dimple K.,"Jackson Heights, NY",56,104,4,3.0,7/25/2017,"Agh I came here on a Sunday brunch. I figured that I should come back as the Carne Asada I had last time was so good. Bad idea.  Service was the worst and our food was not cooked to perfection. The pizzas themselves looked sloppy, as I could tell they just made it in a rush The taste was not authentic. Even the sauce that comes with the Carne Asada was super super bitter. We got the California club as well. It had a lot of lettuce but barely any bacon or avocado. Stick to the carne asada, as it has a better rep. However, DO NOT COME HERE DURING BUSY TIMES on weekends! Disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4
Stephen D.,"New York, NY",3,31,118,3.0,8/12/2017,Been to California Pizza Kitchen before but never really to eat. I've always hung out by the bar to watch a game and have a drink because they make good cocktails. For my first time eating there I can say the food was ok. The chicken for my chicken Milanese was tasty but I didn't like the presentation. It was just buried under a bed of arugula and cheese. I do feel they have a wide array of choices to select from. The service was ok.  The bolognese spaghetti was nothing to write home about as 2 people from my table felt that it tasted bland. The sauce did not stand out. My mother thought her fettuccine was ok but nothing to rave about.  The true winner is the pizza! Ordered three cheeses and carne asada pizza and it was delicious. I would definitely order those again. I also like the appearance of the place. Good prices and decent food,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4

The service was S L O W. We were seated almost immediately. The waiter took our drink and food order soon thereafter. However, we did not receive our beverages for at least 20 minutes. The food arrived another 20 minutes later. We ordered lettuce wraps and ONE pizza. I won't even discuss the wait for the check OR the amount of waiting for the waiter to return with the credit card.  This was my first time at California Pizza Kitchen. Is it normal to wait 40 minutes for a pizza?

Derrick M.,"Austin, TX",1,1,1,1.0,10/24/2017,I have came to this location multiple times until  I was satisfied. Paid $16 for a small pizza and only had six pieces of tiny steak on it.

SM V.,"Sunnyside, Queens, NY",53,104,45,3.0,9/9/2017,"I'm a recent CPK fan only b/c there weren't too many of their locations where I lived in LI and Queens. Luckily, this location is close by and happy I can experience some of their delicious food (b/c honestly, you sometimes crave it).  I go to this location during off peak hours (weekdays around 2 or 3pm) and although I never had a horrible experience, I've never had a perfect experience. Yes, there staff is always polite and the servers are generally good but for off peak hours, I feel like it's still a little off.  Cons - Every time I go there, I always receive dirty appetizer plates such as dried, leftover food remnants the dishwasher couldn't quite remove. One time, the bottom plate was previously used and it somehow go to my table. Ew. - Although the restaurant is generally slow, it's always hard to get our server's attention. I would expect that during peak hours so I'm just a little confused at why their attentiveness isn't great. Pros - The food is pretty consistent every time I go there and I can't complain. You know what you're getting at CPK and this location delivers. I haven't had a bad meal yet (jinx!). - The managers there are great. Specifically Don O'Niel and Drew. About a month ago, I called the restaurant asking to speak to a manager about my dining experience earlier that afternoon. Although the server was nice, it was apparent he needed additional training. Don listened and seemed genuinely concerned about the service we received and offered complimentary apps for our next visit. I took advantage of the offer yesterday and although Don wasn't there, Drew, the manager that day, honored the request with no issues at all. I'll definitely return knowing that the managers care about the customer's experience. Thanks again Don and Drew! - There's outdoor seating, so that's always a plus!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4
Jamie A.,"Woodside, NY",3,27,59,4.0,9/18/2017,It's alright. My fave thing here is the sangria and their buffalo cauliflower. It really takes like buffalo chicken wing lol!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4
Amanda W.,"Hyde Park, Austin, TX",209,95,104,3.0,9/3/2016,"Ok so I've been to this CPK a few times and I think the biggest issue is consistency. Sometimes your order is great sometimes it's not. I usually get the BBQ chicken salad to go, no dress extra BBQ sauce on the side. This last time was disappointing. The chicken looked like it was leftover from something else and there wasn't much of it, my side of BBQ sauce (which I basically use as dressing) I was given the small container and it wasn't even 1/4 full (usually they'll give the large with a good amount of BBQ sauce in it.) the tortilla strips in the salad were a bit stale. Again... Consistency, I've had this salad before from this location it's been great!  The bread that comes with it was in a small plastic bag with the oil, the oil opened and spilt all over it so it wasn't edible. Not really their fault but perhaps should look into a different way to store that for to go orders. In honesty I wasn't going to eat the bread anyways so this helped me out. I'll definitely go back because I've had better experiences than this one, and when the salad is made correctly it's a really good salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4
Jenny T.,"Queens, NY",0,8,22,1.0,11/28/2017,This was horrible.   I went for my sons 14th Birthday  I thought since it was mid day around 230 it's dead you would think service should be at its game.  Sorry I went.    I had movie tickets for Justice League at 420 and they took so long to serve the food.  Then once the meal came the waitress never came to check up on us.  I had to get up at 410 to say hey.  My movie is in 10min I like to see the desert menu to celebrate my sons birthday with a cake.  She gave me the desert with the food still on table. She never picked up the dinner.  Now I'm sitting there with empty plates of food and desert.  Oh I gave her candles for my sons cake.

Christine P.,"MASPETH, NY",73,151,3,3.0,6/20/2017,"Came back here after a few years. Def not as good as it used to be. Not horrible but not amazing (at least what I had). I ordered the waldorf salad and it was okay. I want to know why I got 4 lil pieces of chicken they tried to swindle me with inside of that high spring mix salad for $16?! My friend ordered the protein bowl as a healthier option and said she liked it. We did order the peach sangria and I liked that! Give the sangria a try to see if you like any of them. Our server was friendly and came in a timely manner with our food. Luckily, I didn't experience what I see a lot of reviews mentioning, miserable ppl/service.  Would I come back?

Thomas G.,"Oceanside, NY",15,172,3,2.0,5/22/2017,"Very attractive place. We sat down for lunch on Friday and we were forgotten about. She finally came over and was cute about it but as a server she was not good. Extremely heavy handed and it seemed line she did not want to be there. Food was OK, we both had soup and salad and again just ok, my salad came out incorrect. A child's party was breaking up when we got there. While we were sitting, waiting for someone to come over, the person in charge of reorganizing the restaurant after the kids party, was kind enough to drag the 56 metal chair the 48 feet across the stone floor to where it belonged.  We could not hear each other for 10 minutes.  The place was not busy and the whole staff seemed in the weeds the whole time. The 8 million dollars they spent on the place should have been $7,900,000.00 and spent $100,000.00 on employee training but they never do.......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4

The pizza is always top of the line but so are many of the other dishes, they don't only specialize in pizza. The appetizer I always for are the Spring Rolls. There are 3 options: Veggie, Thai & Baha Chicken. The veggie option I always get (although I am no vegetarian) it's just as delectable. It comes with eggplant on the inside with other vegetables and the taste is just as wowwing. They never disappoint.

Maggie Z.,"Middle Village, NY",735,265,684,3.0,2/18/2016,"I've always wanted to try a CPK because my friends use to hype it up and say it was really good(this was a couple years ago), nonetheless back then I thought the only one that existed in NY was in Manhattan and wasn't willing to made the trip so I was ecstatic to accidentally find a CPK in Atlas Park! We came in for Valentine's Day lunch and were seated right away. There's a lot of booths here for families or couples to sit, bar seats where you can watch the pizza cook, and little tables scattered all over. So, yeah-- they are definitely not short on seats! They have a menu that includes a ""seasonal"" section that changes with the seasons. I decided to order the mahi mahi tacos w/ a magherita pizza(I mean of course you have to get a pizza!) It took a little bit for our starter to come, bread w/ olive oil. In fact, it took so long I didn't even know there would be starters. The starter was just okay. The mahi mahi tacos were delicious to me, full of sauce and just cooked to perfection. The pizza was not bad either. Nothing was spectacular about these two entrees and I probably would not consider coming back to have them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=20

Sometimes the pasta is a little hard but its not terrible. The service is great. I would recommend this california pizza kitchen any day.

Matthew R.,"Maspeth, Queens, NY",46,364,4,3.0,12/28/2016,"Typical CPK located in the Atlas Park Mall in Glendale. Pretty large space that is usually full up on prime nights during the week and weekend. Service was quick and efficient. Place is well kept and clean. One minor issue is if you are sitting by the front, people will ignore the ""please use the revolving door"" sign and it may get a bit drafty.  The pizzas have a nice thin crust, and good toppings. Desserts are good as well.  Also, for people on Weight Waters, all of their items are already in the points system.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=20

At least not about this place.          I came in to meet a friend, they picked the place, and we just kept it simple, apps, drinks and desserts.  the drinks took a while, especially if you are physically sitting at the bar, apps came out soon after our drinks arrived, and the dessert's took the longest.  Once we finally got them which was our Chocolate cake and our Key Lime Pie a la mode. Whipped cream and ice cream were practically melted all over the plate, along with our check. When we tried to get the server's attention to let him know we weren't content with the vanilla flood on our plates, he was way out of reach. no one was in our visuals close by except the man and woman making pizza's right in front of us. it was a bit annoying.  We reluctantly paid, gave a sensible tip against our better judgement, and left.

Our drinks took about 15 mins to arrive then our food all came separately first came the children's about 25 mins after ordering. Our food took a good 30 mins after the children's so by time time we were eating the children had already finished theirs which for anyone who has children knows that if they are not entertained then they will not sit still.

I want to give this place 4 stars but I just can't. We were a party of 7 and we were seated quickly. We all sat down and waited 15 minutes for the waitress to ask us what we wanted to drink. Then, she took our drinks down and talked to her friend for another 5 minutes before giving us our drinks, we had to call her a few times before she came to us. Then, she must've misheard one of us and gave us so much attitude for the wrong order. For appetizers we got he crispy mac n cheese, spinach artichoke dip (with pita instead of chips), and the avocado club egg rolls. These were delicious, however the crispy mac n cheese wasn't that special. The BBQ chicken pizza was good but after a few bites it didn't have that wow factor anymore. The chicken in the salads (quinoa and arugula/ Cesar) had this burnt taste to it but the salad itself was amazing. Lastly, the garlic chicken and mushroom fettuccine was my favorite dish, the portions were great and I was stuffed. Overall, the waitress did not make us feel welcomed and she gave us so much attitude while we were there. I felt like she was only nice to us at the end when she gave us the check for her tip.

We returned after 20 minutes to find that they had already called our name but luckily they seated us right away. Our waiter was very nice but kept us waiting constantly. Hubs ordered a soda and when it was brought to the table he found that it was completely flat--he let the waiter know and the waiter apologized and brought him another soda--this one flatter than the first! You could actually see that it was completely clear, wouldn't the waiter notice that? Then once our food came we had no napkins or utensils.  I wasn't impressed by the pizza. I got a classic Margarita pizza and something was off about it. My sister also did not completely enjoy her salad.  I think my lust for CPK was pushing it.

Natalie V.,"Howard Beach, Queens, NY",78,70,355,4.0,11/10/2015,"I've been coming to the CPK in Glendale since it opened a couple of years ago. The restaurant has gone through its fair share of managers, menu options and physical changes throughout the years. I remember always loving the fresh taste of their food and would frequently visit, despite my aversion to food chains. However, I had a bad experience at the restaurant about 6 months ago that put me on a CPK hiatus. I was a little apprehensive about returning, but I'm glad that I did because this time the service and food were wonderful. We had an extremely attentive waitress that would frequently check up on us and would refill our drinks and bread baskets using what seemed like telepathy. We never had to flag her down. The managers and waitress cheerfully waited on us throughout our stay. The food was equally great. We ordered the spinach artichoke pizza from the fall menu and it was delectable; delicious notes of garlic and a creamy spinach sauce. We also ordered the Tostada pizza (Tex-Mex inspired) and the classic 5 cheese pizza. We got the Barbecue Chopped Salad to top it all off, and we doused EVERYTHING in their magical ranchito sauce. That sauce tastes like it was crafted by cherubs and made exclusively for the gods. If you visit CPK, do yourself a favor and get a side of the ranchito (trust me). For dessert we ordered several servings of the Butter Cake (a cult classic) and the salted caramel pudding (which I tried for the first time and Hallelujah!)

There was no rush and the restaurant was empty. Restaurant was clean and well kept. Our server wasn't the most social and didn't keep tabs on our table, at all. To the point where my boyfriend had to get up and fetch his soda from the bar from a miserable looking woman who wouldn't even take his glass but had him hold it across the bar. When the issue was addressed to the assistant general manager Don, he didn't care. He was very nonchalant about the situation. To make matters worse, he gives us comp small plate cards for our next visit which expires in July. It was like a slap in the face and giving excuses like ""we only have 2 waitresses""..  not a paying patrons problem. Instead of rectifying the situation properly, what makes you think I would even spend another penny at cpk? What's worse.. the general manager mike was hiding in the back and didn't even bother to show his face. It was poorly handled but thankfully Mike the kitchen manager handled a customer service issue. Does that even make sense to have the kitchen manager handle a customer complaint about service and not food?

Prieta S.,"MIDDLE VLG, NY",57,10,,3.0,11/2/2015,"Very dissatisfied with this CPK located in Atlas Park.  I've been going to this spot for as long as I've been living in the neighborhood (4 years) and I've NEVER experienced a bad visit until now.   The quality of the food is good.  Lots better than Chili's, which is located in Atlas Park as well.    The service, however, has changed dramatically and not for the better.   I went yesterday with my son because I wanted to have their rib eye, which is very good.  Even though for some reason I can't get a steak medium as I've asked for, more than once. Since I've noticed that service has been declining at this location, I started my timer on my phone to see how long it would take a waiter to come to our table.  It took almost 10 minutes for a waiter to come to our table and it was only because my son flagged down the hostess and informed her that we had been waiting 10 minutes and no one had come to take our order.   Florian finally came to our table and took our drink order and since we had so much time to look at the menu, took our entree order as well.  We noticed that Florian was the only one working the section we were in, so we really can't blame him as we noticed two waitresses walk in while we were waiting at the table.  We assumed they ran late.  The whole process took so long...almost an hour and we had not been served our drinks that we left.  I made sure to tell the hostess so that she was aware that we had been waiting so long, it was unacceptable.  And by the way, the location was no busier than it normally is on a Sunday at that time (early afternoon).   We ended up going to Chili's, which was just as busy, perhaps, busier since their restaurant is much bigger than CPK, was seated right away and I don't think we waited 3 minutes before our waitress came to our table and took our drink order. CPK is still a very good restaurant.  The food is great, but it doesn't matter if the service is not on point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=60

There were 3 of us total and we actually got seated fairly quickly (within 10 minutes) even though the place looked packed. 1 star for that. We got a menu that actually had food inside of it and when asked for another, a waitress took it away with attitude as if we had placed the food in the menu.  It took the waiter forever to come introduce himself. It took him long enough for us to decide what drinks and food we wanted to order. We had a feeling it'd take forever to get his attention so we wanted to order it all in one shot. We ordered our drinks and then the food ordering came.... I got the salmon - fine, all good there. One person wanted the ribeye which we were told was out. Another wanted the chicken... Again... Out. Then they both tried to order a pasta dish..all seemed fine and then we found out there was no more fettuccini... And if you know their menu, practically every pasta dish is fettuccini based. One eventually settles for penne noodles (they end up giving spaghetti) and another settled for fish (which was of course dry). It took about 45mins to get the food. Throughout the meal, the waiter hardly checked in on us. A friend kept feeling something drip down on her and she didn't realize it was water of some sort dripping from the ceiling. We told the waitress behind us at the cash register (same one with the attitude from the menu incident) and she just rudely says ""I don't see anything."" And when my friend says that she can still feel it, the waitress brushes it off and just says ""okay i'll tell someone."" We end up telling our own waiter and his reply was ""I don't see how anything could be dripping from there. Maybe it's the AC then."" I mean we were just giving them a heads up and they were genuinely pissed off that we were doing so. In short, I'll never go back again. It takes a lot to piss me off to the point of not giving a tip to the guy. I usually at least give something, but this time I opted to give the money to charity instead of putting it on the tip line.

We had just finished watching a movie and then came into the restaurant; it looked like it had been under new management. We got seated by the manager Mike himself. My girlfriend and I waited a whopping 15-17 mins and no waiter came to us. I'm a patient person but what upset me the most was that Mike the manager, himself, was taking orders from tables that got seated way after we got seated, yet, didn't care about us. We left displeased with the restaurant. Idk if I would go as far as to say never go to this place, but I was very unhappy with the long wait after being seated. Maybe Mike needs some management as well. Btw we left without eating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=80
Sofie S.,"Shippensburg, PA",4,114,26,1.0,4/7/2015,"So some friends and I went in and there was no server. They saw us and ignored us for about 5 minutes...and the rest of the evening went downhill from there... We ordered our drinks (no ice for me) and our food. We got our drinks (mine with ice...not that big of a deal) and our food came a lot later. We had no silverware or napkins. After unsuccessfully waving at the waitstaff and staring at them in desperate attempts to get some service, we managed to track one down and beg for utensils; 15 minutes later we got some.  The food was good, yet they left the shrimp tails on in the pasta which is usually not normal anywhere but whatever, at least we wouldn't be eating with our hands right...  My boyfriend and I went with another couple who each had a birthday. We snuck out earlier to request dessert for the bday folks after our food. Apparently that meant to leave us in limbo waiting for a half hour. After seeing our waitress skip out on the tables to play bartender for 20 minutes, we realized she was not coming back and we were left alone to our defenses yet again. We canceled dessert, paid and walked out. We opted for the better service at Coldstone down the block.  Moral of the story- thanks for ruining a decent evening with your shitty service CPK. My friend is leaving for a few years and we wanted a laid back bday dinner before they left. The food was decent, but the service was so atrocious we won't be coming back.

Abigail T.,"Glendale, Queens, NY",2530,361,3267,3.0,3/17/2014,"Hanging out with the bestie means I have limited choices of food when it comes to lunch or dinner time. It's either Vietnamese, Filipino or Italian food for us.  CPK is located inside Atlas mall. A great outdoor mall but most of the time overlooked. If there is anything that has always been here since I started coming, it's the theatre, Simply Fondue, Starbucks and this place. It was packed on a Saturday afternoon, no wonder it stayed open. We were  promptly seated as soon as we got there. Apparently, everyone else waiting outside wanted booth seating. Hmmmm...more space for me then. We ordered two small plates, a white corn guacamole with chips and spicy fennel sausage with pepper flat bread. I cannot quite remember but I believe they were both under $5 if not a little more. Guacamole was fresh and the white corn made great sense as my taste bufs loves it. The flat bread was also great and could definitely take the place of the thin crust pizza. For our main dishes, we shared Hawaiian thin crust pizza (besties fave) and Pesto Penne with shrimp. Pizza was alright. Sweet pineapple and ham always a good combo. I've always gotten their BLT pizza since I first tried it back in the day, a slight deviation from my norm but didn't hurt a bit. Pasta dish was creamy, the penne does look like it wasn't fresh and may have come from dry boxed pasta but it was cooked perfectly. CPK is a food chain that somehow kept it's quality of food and service, IMO. I'd most likely come back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=80

There were two other tables in our section that the waitress was walking back and forth to, us being just between the two tables. She walked by us about 4 times and we didn't even get a ""hello."" After realizing that this waitress was ignoring us, we looked around for another employee to flag down or even just make eye contact with.

They have outside seating in the spring summer and fall and it's very enjoyable to sit outside with a nice cold mimosa in the summer and relax and enjoy the surrounding views.

Boyfriend got the meat lovers pizza which was good too. As appetizers we got the fried mac & cheese and the Korean bbq tacos. I had really high hopes for the mac & cheese but it wasn't anything spectacular. The Korean bbq tacos had a spicy kick to it that I would totally go for again. Ended the night with a chocolate brownie with ice cream.. the brownie wasn't soft! I thought I would break the spoon eating it.

Alvar L.,"Staten Island, NY",66,19,,1.0,7/23/2013,"Came here with my girlfriend on a Monday evening. We were seated by a very bored, uninterested, preoccupied teenager who must have been practicing her best robot impersonation.  She commanded: ""Two? Sit. Enjoy.""  So we sat, went over the menu, and waited... and waited... and waited...  20 minutes pass and we've pretty much memorized the menu. We were hungry. But there was no server or waitress in sight. Since being seated, no one else had come to help us. No waters, no silverware, not even a little cocktail napkin to place drinks on. Did they forget us? It wasn't like we were hard to find; we were smack dab in the middle of the restaurant floor. And it wasn't exactly a busy night, either. We looked around and notice all of the unhappy faces juxtaposed on the other customers. Some were visibly annoyed waiting to order, and others had finished eating before we had even arrived and sat awkwardly, waiting for the check.  In other words: service was slower than slow. A couple near us left a booth seat, so we asked the busboy wiping it down if we could switch to the booth. As he was just the busboy and had no real pull in the restaurant, he goes to relay our message to the uninterested teenage robot.  She doesn't say a word to us, but speaks only to the busboy in Spanish. Thanks to my 8th grade Spanish skills, I overheard her mention that she wanted to reserve the booth for parties of more than 2 people. So the busboy comes and tells us no. Not 5 minutes later, she seats a party of 2 in that very same seat. Having wasted a half hour of our time to be completely ignored, we left. And that's okay, because this is New York City; you don't need to go to some national strip-mall chain restaurant for good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=120

Juliana G.,"East Elmhurst, NY",0,1,,1.0,3/30/2016,"VERY UPSET AND NEVER COMING BACK!! This is my first time rating on YELP, and i felt that i needed to express my unsatisfying experience at CPK. On Sunday, March 27, 2016 my boyfriend and I were at Atlas Mall, and were hungry; so we decided to try CPK for the first time. We get there and my boyfriend gives the hostess his name. We proceed to wait for about 10 mins, and we noticed that a couple that walked in after us was seated. At first we thought nothing of it, until 3 minutes later another couple that came in after us was seated as well! So, my boyfriend and I were very upset, and he goes up to the hostess and asks her why were these people that came in after us were seated, and when she asked him for his name; my boyfriend sees his name crossed out! He tells her that's his name and its crossed out, meanwhile we're still waiting. HER explanation was that some other hostess must of called him, and sat another couple who pretended to be us down. HOLD ON! so you mean to tell me that outside of her being there, there is someone else sitting other people down. Never have i been to a restaurant where there are up to THREE or more people sitting customers down. SO, i we were very upset about that. So, we would assumed that the next table that was available would be given to us... NOPE, three more groups that came in after us was seated down.  We also asked for a table not next to the door, because that day was very chilly and i wasn't feeling well. When they do call us, they sit us by the door. So my boyfriend asks if we can sit somewhere else thats not by the door, and she said she couldn't, and if we want another table we have to wait another 10 mins! Meanwhile, i saw 3 open booths by the window emptied. That made me even more upset... to top it off i saw another couple that was sitting two tables down from us that was seated before us even though they got to the restaurant after us, were moved to one of the empty booths that i saw earlier. FYI the hostess told my boyfriend that they were the couple that were seated under our name by the other hostess!!! SO you mean to tell me that they were getting better treatment than us; after they pretended to be someone else! VERY UPSET!! Just to wrap it off the STRAWBERRY LEMONADE, THE ORIGINAL LEMONADE DID NOT TASTE GOOD, AND WHEN I ASKED FOR A SPRITE. THERE WASNT ANY LEFT. I got a coke instead... THE SPINACH ARTICHOKE DIP HAD NO FLAVOR AND THE CHIPS WERE STALE.  The only thing that saved the place the the semi-good pizza. My boyfriend asked for crispy crust, and it was was soggy and falling apart. AND our waiter BRIAN EUGENE, his service was great! Even after changing my drink more than once, he did not make us feel like a bother  ((P.S. he didn't charge for our drinks)). He made us actually feel like customers who mattered, unlike the hostess'. Thank You for your service Brian!! But sadly, we will not be returning to the restaurant. I really hope they read this and take notice of what is going on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=120

Today for appetizer we had one of the new item on the appetizer menu; the bianco flatbread. I like it was good for drinks I had the passion fruit mojito but I wasn't crazy about after drinking 1/3 I decide to stop drinking. For our entree I ordered the garlic parmesan fetticinni w/ shrimp. This plate was good the shrimp were he freshest I've ever had in restaurant setting. My date had gluten free Hawaiian pizza but that was definitely a waste of money. I've had gluten free food and never taste so unflavored before.

Anna P.,"Flushing, NY",18,8,8,1.0,2/18/2016,I recently visited this location as I am a big fan of this chain.  The pizza was terrific as always however the service from start to finish was something to be desired.  I had to repeat how many guests we were 4 times to be seated.  Then our waiter was terrible.  He messed up our orders and would serve the wrong order bc he didn't what each of us ordered or didn't care.  To boot he asked us to help him to pass him all the dirty plates.  The service felt as if the point if eating out was missed when you have to help clear the table!  To make matters worse and the icing in the cake was the bill.  We wanted to split the bill however I was charged twice.  My I told the server he had an attitude and said this wasn't possible. He went and corrected the situation however at the same time overcharging my card again. When I called over a manager he came over initially very compative and argumentative.  He again when's to correct the overcharge however it's still on my credit card.  There were no apologies by the staff during this situation and instead only discomfort. I highly discourage going to this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=120

Ken T.,"Rego Park, NY",386,123,62,5.0,2/14/2013,"Came here today for Valentine's Day dinner with my girlfriend and even though it was a very busy night, we were seated almost immediately by a very welcoming waitress. We ordered the $30 Valentine's Day meal which included an appetizer, two entrees and a dessert. For the appetizer we chose the Spinach Artichoke Dip which was amazing. The portion was more than enough for the both of us and the dip was savory to the last bite. We also ordered a Mango-Raspberry Colada to go with our meal and this is WELL WORTH the $4.50. Usually, I am not a big fan of spending so much for a drink. I mean, why spend 5 bucks on a drink when I can get an entire box of Halal?? But I have to say, this drink was Delicious. Amazing. And Pure Joy to Drink. Need I say more? For the entrees, I ordered the Five Cheese Pizza (based on the reviews on Yelp) while my girlfriend ordered the KungPao Spaghetti. The pizza was amazing. The blend of different cheeses melting in your mouth makes you never want to stop eating. And the KungPao Spaghetti provided a unique blend of Asian and American flavor to the table.  For the dessert, we got the Belgian Chocolate Souffle which was tasty but nothing too special. Overall, I think this place did an amazing job in serving their customers. The food was great, and they have great staffs. The people there are extremely friendly and they genuinely care about your experience there. If you ever get a chance to be around the area, I implore you to go eat there!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=120

I choose a thin crust artichoke and spinach pizza.  I liked the crust, but that's about it.....  Honestly, I wish I ordered a salad.  The salads look really good.   They have a large wine list,  And they will serve half a glass (3oz), or a full glass.  I liked the fact that the Santa Margarita was only $30. per bottle....  That is only an $8.00 markup.  I usually see it priced at $40-50. at most restaurants.  I was here around 12 noon, children were seated at almost every table!  Lot's of noise, screaming, staring children.......... I guess this is the place to be, if you want to take your children and meet a friend who also wants to dine out with their children.......  I'm not necesarily saying thats a bad thing, it's just not a place I prefer to be......

I have worked in the service industry and I always try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but without exaggeration, we had to wait just shy of 40 mins for dessert once, and had to wait close to that for food on two other occasions. The final straw was when the last time a manager or assistant manager was waiting on us and the food came out very sporadically. My daughter had to wait 10 mins for her meal, and they brought out the three other meals several mins apart in the mean time. Then I had to literally walk around the restaurant trying to find someone to get us dessert and pay the bill. So disorganized!!  Today (several months later) we decided to give them one more chance and used their website's ""curbside pick up"". I was SHOCKED at the ineptitude of this service. I had a pick up time scheduled for 6:39pm. I arrived a few mins after that and called. No answer for 3 full mins of ringing. After a few more minutes, my friend went in, only to be told they had JUST put our food in the oven. (Now 10 mins AFTER my pick up time.) When he asked where I could wait since there was no place to stop for curbside pickup, the very rude woman shrugged her shoulders. He asked when it would be ready and she shrugged again. So I ended up circling this crowded mall parking lot for over TWENTY FIVE MINUTES, the whole time trying to call a manager who never picks up. Exactly 30 mins after my pick up time I parked and went in to find they were FINALLY  packing up my food and didn't seem the least bit concerned that I had been waiting so long. I finally got to see the managerial, who mumbled something about being busy and offered a very insincere, ""we apologize for any inconvenience, but we are busy."" My kids even agreed this time that their pizza is mediocre at best.

Waiters disappear for at least 20 minutes (this especially when there is hardly anyone around). And it's a different waiter every time. I usually catch them in the back talking to each other.

We took  the food out of the bag and not only was everything Cold but I think they took the egg rolls and pizza out of the refrigerator and forgot to reheat it.  That's how disgusting the food was.  Caesar salad is usually more than some shriveled lettuce and should have dressing. None!! So we immediately called the restaurant only to be transferred to take out that never picked up!  Can you imagine?  Now we're pissed and called again only to be transferred to possibly a manager but that was useless. After we told them our situation there was silence!! No apology, no comment just silence.  So I hung up.  Wish I had paid by credit card, at least we could have challenged the charge.  So being furious for lack of customer service and recourse we called the corporate offices. It took two days for them to return our call and promised that we would be contacted by the restaurant. Well it's two weeks and nothing.  I guess they do enough business not to care.

We were seated at a restaurant table that was situated close to the bar area, as such the music was extremely loud. I did not enjoy myself because I could not relax with my meal due to the music blasting. I asked the waitress to lower the music, but I do not think that they did. Everything was very chaotic. Everyone's food looked good, but my fish tacos were not- I am not one to send  a meal back but I couldn't eat it! The texture was not appealing, nor was the taste (I normally love fish tacos). The lime they served it with was so dry I couldn't squeeze a drop of juice out of it. I only ate one of the three tacos on my plate and it contained the stem of the avocado inside- yuck! Fortunately, the manager was really great. He said he wanted me to be satisfied and took it away. He didn't charge me. I would eat here again, if I could sit at a table far away from the loud music and I'd try a different menu item.

Sometimes it takes longer for orders to come out if there's a lot going on. Small square canvas paintings of avocados, seasonings, and pizzas are covered by glass on the wall. There is also a little seating area outside by Starbucks. They play some hip and happenin' music. Maybe something off of Cee Lo Greens album or an Adele track adds to the casual dining experience.

Laurie X.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,5.0,5/30/2011,"The first time I went to CPK was with my co-worker.  After that visit, I brought my husband there.  It was quite something, as my husband is very picky on food and he used to never like any Western food.  After the visit, surprisingly he fell in love with their pizzas!  Since then we visited CPK almost every week - that is how addicted he is with them. There are only 3 CPKs I can find within New York boroughs, and I've been to all of them.  Glendale by far is the best one with environment. Things to recommend (Note that we are vegetarian but we are OK with eggs and diary products, so the choices do not have meat in them) : Pizzas:  1) Pear & Gorgonzola.  I would never thought of ordering this if it had not been recommended by my colleague.  It turned out to be our all time favorite.  Strange combination but it really brought out the best flavor from pear and the salad.  However, I just found out that their ranch dressing has fish byproduct in it, so vegetarians be aware.  You can ask for it without the ranch dressing though (might be less tasty). 2) Chipotle Chicken, but replace chicken with avocado.  It is spicy, but very tasty. 3) Wild Mushroom.  You can have it with chicken if you are not vegetarian, but without the chicken it tastes good as well. We also tried the Vegetarian with Japanese Eggplant pizza, but not really impressed with it.  That's mostly a standard pizza flavor pizza.  Another pizza I tried was the White Pizza, didn't like it either as it was way too cheesy for me.   I think my recommendation is to try something not so traditional and you might get amazed. Appetizer & drinks: 1) The MEDITERRANEAN Tortilla Spring Rolls and it was good.  Not super star but quite good. 2) Asparagus & Arugula Salad, also quite good. 3) Mint Ruby Cooler, with grapefruit juice and mint, quite good for summer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=200

(I didn't order it, my DH did.)  Lastly, we ordered some sort of Asian dumplings, or spring rolls as an appetizer. They were very tasty. I looked at other people's plates and thought their food looked good.  (I always do that in restaraunts.) The portions are very generous.  I really liked the apple cobbler for dessert, and we did it complete, al la mode.  I'm glad we refrained from the extra hot carmel, because it would have been far too sweet, at least for my palate.  (But I'm not average.) This is probably one of the better places to eat at Atlas Park, and less pretentious than other restaraunts in this mall.   Get there early and be prepared to wait for a good 1/2 hour for a table, particularly on a Friday night.

I used to be a hostess so I understand rotation... but the snarl and comment was not necessary, thanks. Needless to say, our waitress was friendlier, but not attentive. She visited our table 3x: once to take our drink orders, once for our meal orders and once to bring the check. During our meal, I kept looking around to find her because I did want to order dessert and food for take out---but being that she was never around or came by to check on us, I never did. So go for the food and drinks... just not during the early afternoon hours on Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=180
Liliana F.,"Brooklyn, NY",30,56,8,5.0,2/4/2009,"I went to this place in the Atlas Mall and i love love love it! The food is delicious (well not my Alfredo because I've tried better but everything else) they have tons of different kinds of pizza and it's really original. I loved the atmosphere of the place very nice lighting and i loved seeing the brick ovens. It's honestly really pretty inside for a pizza spot. They don't only serve pizza but their known for their different pizza dishes. Their drinks to me were yummy and i went here twice. Once with some friends and once with a date and it was great both times. The prices are reasonable so eat eat! Everything is so fresh which is what i loved. Even the lettuce on the pizza (if you get a pizza with lettuce). But the decor is really nice, very cute for a simple date. Not for nothing for a chain it's nice cause i never seen pizza spots this nice! The pizzas are like personal size but not for nothing it really is a lot of pizza and it fills you up fast!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=180
Whitney P.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,21,,4.0,1/31/2009,"Love this place. The food is great and fresh. The staff are very friendly, attentive and fast. I love the decor of this place and it's very very clean. I never walk out of there without a smile on my face. Sometimes you end up waiting a little bit for your food, but the atmosphere there is so great that I don't mind half the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=180
Meredith F.,"Jamaica, NY",100,371,4,4.0,10/28/2008,"For a chain, CPK is pretty darn good.  I like to consider it the Cheesecake Factory of pizza chains, which is a compliment.  The pizza is tastey, but you have to appreciate it as its own entity.   If you're looking for a thin, traditional NYC, chewy-crust deal- go to a neighborhood joint.  This is ""California"" pizza- so I guess that means it's personal size,  has a bunch of unusual toppings, and  a sweet-ish crust.   As for the other stuff, the salads here are excellent- they are large, fresh, and definitely filling as a meal.  My sister got garlicky fettucini with shrimp, and she cleaned her plate.  I don't eat shrimp, so I didn't try it, but I could tell that the cream sauce was a good texture--it wasn't too thick like some cream sauces that end up congealing as the dish cools down. Last time I was here I got the sweet/spicy Italian sausage and peppers pizza.  (One of the most traditional on the menu.)   Good stuff- the spicy/sweet combo was nice, although I personally would have preferred a little more of the spicy side of the coin.  The pumpkin cheesecake here is absolutely phenomenal.  It has a gingerbread crust, a layer of cheesecake, and a layer of pumpkin pie.  I was ""sharing"" it with my sister, who I believe got about 3 bites in total.  Speaking of the Cheesecake Factory, they have them beat on this one... My one complaint was our server.  She let us sit for a loooong time before coming to take our order.   Then I proceeded to order a glass of Ravenswood Zinfandel, which was on the wine list under ""Interesting Reds.""  Red Zinfandel is one of my favorite red wines, and Ravenswood is a brand I have had before and enjoyed.  So our server brings me back a glass of something pink.  I do not drink pink wine under any circumstances, and I'm pretty sure that pink wine is not considered red.  Instead of apologizing (either for her mistake or for the mis-labeling on the menu) she argued with me for a few minutes, trying to convince me that this pink liquid was in fact Red Zinfandel. Long story short- I sent it back and ordered a nice safe Yellowtail Shiraz.  She gave us a bit of attitude from that point on, until she gave us the check, when of course she turned into an absolute peach. Overall, I like CPK- and it was nice to sit outside on a crisp fall night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=180
Sasha H.,"New York, NY",35,557,,4.0,7/30/2010,"An acquaintance of mine (heh, Hi!) really enjoys their chicken roll appetizer, so whenever we are in the hood we come by and get that to go. Whenever I walk into this place, I'm always tempted to stay for dinner, but usually we have something else pressing to get to (that night, it was a sold-out showing of Inception at the nearby theater. Pressing, indeed.) But it is airy and gorgeous in there, nothing at all like what'd you expect from a national chain. And the chicken roll? Not a huge fan, since that's where you realize you're eating at a chain. Oversalted and unnecessarily greasy, it would taste better with less of both (a true rarity in casual dining and fast food).  But I'll be back to sample those alluring-looking bottles of Carlos Rossi (or some permutation) they have lining their bar (LOL!).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=180

Asya G.,"Los Angeles, CA",68,112,,4.0,9/14/2007,"What can I say: yum. It's not five-star dining, but CPK hits the spot. I really like this particular one, because it's located in the newly-opened Atlas Park shopping center in Queens. For those of you car-mobile, I highly recommend a visit. The landscaping is very nice, and it's very green. It's the perfect dinner-and-a-movie spot (there a multiplex there too).   CPK's not for the diet-conscious, but satisfying in moderation. I always get the tricolor salad (no crust) and one of the pastas. I've never tried their desserts, but the wine list is pretty good for a chain restaurant. I don't recommend the mixed drinks. Oh, and bring a sweater or something long-sleeve -- they're known to blast their A/C during warm months.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=180
Kimberly F.,"Brooklyn, NY",174,430,25,5.0,8/16/2008,"Holy fucking crap i love this place! Its super clean, the people are nice, and the food is really great, always fresh!  The portions are huge, i always go with a friend and split a pizza and get a half salad for my self. Only problem is there not consistent, one day i can wait like 1omins for my meal, and other time and can wait an hour. I actually had a waitress tell me that it took an hour to make a pizza, nah uh  it takes 15mins tops, or so ive be told by a  friend (3rd generation pizzeria owner) Even wen people lie to me about pizza times, i still like this place. I think i could walk in and be hit in the face, and i would still ask for half a Thai Crunch Salad and a shrimp pizza!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=180
Rasha J.,"Manhattan, NY",37,45,131,2.0,9/7/2012,"If you read the other reviews, there are plenty of customer service comments.  Well here's mine.  I've been here several times because this is the closest CPK by me.  Come here for the pizza mostly, but my favorite is the chicken club sandwich.  One commenter states too salty: that can be true at times.  Customer service is bearable.  Not even Good.  There is one manager that's nice, but he's not there everyday.  Otherwise other staff needs to be trained better/more.  Commenter states took so many staff to get them A Glass of Water: True.  There was one manager that brought our ordered pizza to our table without saying anything: Just dropped the pizza at the edge of the table and left.  What if that wasn't ours?  I wouldn't have time to say ""excuse me"" because he left the second the plate hit the table.  I know some would say 'how do you know that was a manager?': he was wearing a regular suit rather than the waiter uniform.  I dread coming here because of the staff.  I just really come for the food.  One more annoying thing:  you have to go through this little hallway, right next to the kitchen entrance to get to the bathrooms.  PS  I've been here both weekdays and weekends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=180
