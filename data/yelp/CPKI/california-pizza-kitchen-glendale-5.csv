Sadie T.,"Milwaukee, WI",166,391,25,4.0,1/3/2012,"I consider CPK a higher end chain restaurant with more selection and better ingredients.  Our waitress was very busy, she told us she was also the bartender and waiting on a whole other set of tables. Because of her workload, she only once refilled waters (which had to be requested, and she looked absolutely exhausted when I asked for waters for all 9 of us). This is management's failing. Overall the food is good. There is a really wide variety of options of pretty classic American Italian food (pizza, white pasta, etc) with some variations. If you are in the mood for middle of the line fare, this is a nice place for you! I like the variety of salads, too. The half field greens salad I had was very good, but too heavy on the dressing. The white pizza was pretty good too, but much more bland than I was expecting.  I like the decor. It has a casual upscale feel. I would recommend, which I don't often say for chains as I prefer to buy local.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-5
Rachel K.,"Milwaukee, WI",138,25,15,4.0,12/1/2011,"I find CPK a bit pricey, but I love, love, love their salads. They are giant and the combinations all work well together. There's always something that hits the spot. For different flavors of pizza it's also fun to try. It isn't your traditional style pizza, so if you're craving that -- go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-5
Joanna T.,"Wauwatosa, WI",415,2214,1025,4.0,5/29/2011,"Yes, it's a chain, one of the chainy-est ones out there. You can buy their pizzas at Pick n Save right next to the horrifying ""appetizers"" from TGIFridays. But the thing is, the pizzas are actually good. They have a wood burning oven so the crust is a nice mix of chewy & crunchy. I can't speak for the other menu items because, well, it's a PIZZA kitchen so that's what I order. The location absolutely sucks though, it's smack in the middle of the most poorly designed mall in Midwest aka Bayshore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-5
Jenni P.,"Milwaukee, WI",64,186,74,2.0,11/12/2011,"Well, I've been here twice, the first time I got pizza, it was pretty good, but I've definitely had better. This last time I was there I got the mac & cheese - and I've definitely had better. For LESS money - you can go to Noodles & Company & get better mac & cheese WITH a chicken breast. It wasn't worth the money, and certainly wasn't anything to write home about - stick to the pizza. Also - way too many kids for my liking - go to Chuck-e-Cheese please, it was insanely loud in there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-5
Heather M.,"Santa Monica, Los Angeles, CA",101,205,973,4.0,5/30/2011,"Gotta agree with Joanna T's review - yeah, it's a chain restaraunt but they really do actually have good pizza. The ingrediants always taste so fresh and unlike a New York or Chicago pizza, it very has a ""California taste"". They pizza's aren't dripping in sauce (or grease!) but instead something you can eat without making a mess. A ""classy"" pizza, if you may. Call me boring but I usually go with the traditional cheese because I don't want any other flavors distracting from the great, fresh taste of their cheese and bread! But all of the other pizzas I've tried have been fantastic as well.  Parking isn't great at this location but it's worth a short walk. Service is ALWAYS fast at every CPK I've been to across the country. Whenever I order for carry out, it's also very quick, no matter what the hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-5
Matt X.,"Milwaukee, WI",33,100,62,2.0,6/7/2011,"First, a warning: this is a large, sanitized sit-down only restaurant that only serves whole pies. The other locations I've previously tried of this chain are cafeteria-style affairs with generous slices and dishes you can mix-and-match on the cheap. Anyway, we only hit this place once and we're not coming back. The service and drinks were great, but the strip-mall atmosphere was sterile and the food utterly mediocre. The pie had decent sauce but crust too thick and chewy. Dough wasn't light or stretchy and cheese not browned whatsoever. Even trying out the interesting toppings of broccoli rabe, Japanese eggplant, mushroom, and sun-dried tomato didn't salvage the bigger shortcomings.  A pizza place is measured by the quality of the pies, and Glendale's California Pizza Kitchen falls way short of the mark.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-5

Shawn C.,"Lake Worth, FL",0,68,13,1.0,9/6/2011,"Upon walking into this restaurant yesterday, we were shown to a table that was not to our liking because there were three adults and one toddler and the table was in a traffic hot spot. I asked to be moved to another table (which I pointed out) and the ""AA"" woman gave a look of ""how dare you not take the table I give you"" and went back to the host area to do something. I let it go as we were hungry, but upon her return, she tried to sit us at another table that was in a high traffic area. This time when I told here this was not the table I wanted, she sighed loudly and walked away! I saw/heard her go to the host stand and hand off menus, tell them she couldn't deal with me and walk away! she proceeded to the kitchen (which is completely open to the view of the patrons) and tell them how obnoxious I was for not taking the table she gave me. The manager came over and was just as worthless. I told him all that had transpired and all he did was say that he would have a talk with her but the table i wanted was in a ""closed section"". IT WAS SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE EATING!!! All the while, the ""AA"" woman is still going on to others in the kitchen about us and I can see/hear her!!!  I have made a call/email to corporate office and will see what happens, but unfortunately I will go back because I love the Thai crunch salad and my father-in-law lives in this area.  I guess I am sick of restaurants that act as though they are doing me a favor by serving me! I know there are exceptions to ""the customers are always right"" but to act like that and the manager to be apathetic and not even try to get us to stay... what is going on in the service world!!!  If you go here and she serves you, immediately request a new server!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-5
Marvin M.,"Milwaukee, WI",33,175,66,4.0,11/26/2011,Been here many times with family. Always have to wait for a table. Was here recently by myself and immediately got a seat at the bar. Service was quick. Split pea soup is excellent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-5

Michelle S.,"Marina del Rey, CA",72,55,72,4.0,9/17/2011,"I was excited to move to a city with a California Pizza Kitchen and this location is just as good as the others. While I wish it was downtown, it is nice that it's attached to the mall, and it's a nice mall. The outdoor seating is also nice in the summer. I have never had a bad pizza here. Yeah, it's a chain, but it's a really good chain!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-5
Steven B.,"Spirit Lake, IA",67,13,9,5.0,12/10/2011,"First time here. Great waitress named Alyson, very friendly and took good care of us. Liked their variety of pizzas, went with 9 of us and found something for everyone. Chipolte chicken and thai chicken pizzas both excellent. For something completely different we tried the pear gorganzola pizza, it was AWESOME.  Bottom line... if you want more than ordinary pizza try out the California Pizza Kitchen",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-5
