Val T.,"Oregon City, OR",0,4,,5.0,12/2/2017,I love this place.  My favorite is the Thai Crunch Salad!!!  The manager Suzanne is the best and always stops to talk with me and my husband when we go.  I would eat there every day if I could!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-happy-valley
Leana W.,"Rockford, IL",64,93,53,5.0,11/11/2017,"Unlike Olive Garden across the street that had a line going out the door for Veterans Day specials, we didn't have to deal with a 1+ hour wait here. In fact, not only were we seated immediately, we were greeted by a very friendly server Nicci, our drinks ordered and served right away, and our food came out within 25 minutes nice and hot. And... they have 9oz wine pours. I could come here and just eat their avocado egg rolls-- they are so good. She was on top of our refills which made the Hubs happy. My hubs was given a special Veterans Day menu and ordered a 10 inch pizza which was more than filling. Although we came on Veterans Day which is a busy time for restaurants, I've been here 3x prior and have always had good food and excellent service. I love the open kitchen concept and large comfortable booths. I would definitely come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-happy-valley
Jolie M.,"Portland, OR",117,53,85,4.0,11/2/2017,"My girl friend and I wanted a light lunch and a glass of wine- CPK did not disappoint. Efficient and friendly service. Warm atmosphere. I had a petite wedge salad that was huge and it was $5! My friend had the lunch duo with  7"" pizza and a Caesar for $11.95. She took most of the pizza home. This is a great spot at Clackamas Town Center- busy at 12 but not crazy on a rainy Thursday. I recommend!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-happy-valley
Reneé J.,"Happy Valley, OR",40,6,,5.0,11/29/2017,I love love love this place!!!!! The chicken Cesar salads.... ugh!!! To die for!

Esther K.,"Portland, OR",100,161,18,2.0,2/16/2017,"I grew up in a city that had a CPK in our local mall, which meant that my friends and I ate there ALL the time. I still know their menu like the back of my band. I was excited to re-live that magic at the Clackamas location and was sadly disappointed.  I was seated at the bar which probably seats 30 people though only 6 seats were occupied and yet it took over 15 minutes just to get menus and waters. I ordered the chips and guacamole appetizer and the portion literally was so small that I would bet my life they didn't even use an entire avocado's worth of guac on the plate.  The chopped barbecue chicken salad was still as good as I remember it, but way too expensive for what it is.  I think I would have been OK with the whole experience if there weren't at least 10 waiters scurrying around the half-empty restaurant and I still had to wait ages to get any service before or after ordering.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-happy-valley
Kelly B.,"Portland, OR",9,6,,2.0,7/2/2017,"I give it two stars because the service was great. Our server was friendly, attentive and charming. The food however left much to be desired. I visit the CPK at Bridgeport quite often and the food there is always amazing. First I ordered the spicy buffalo cauliflower and the outside coating/batter was soggy and the cauliflower on the inside was on the mushy side, it was not tender. I then ordered the Thai chicken pizza and it was bland, the chickens tasted like it was boiled and there was no flavor. Someone else in our party ordered the Ribeye steak...it was flavorful but over-cooked. Three other people in our party ordered the  King Pao pasta and it was too salty and the peanuts were burned. The Thai Crunch Chicken salad was really good. I don't know if it was an off day for those in the kitchen but the food was way off the norm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-happy-valley
Kim P.,"Tacoma, WA",169,509,42,3.0,4/20/2017,"Been to a handful of CPK's as they are opening more in the PNW area, this particular location was a pretty decent size and my daughter's softball team wanted to grab some food as a team after playing 3 games and going 3-0! Walking in, the place was pretty empty so that was a plus for us since we rolled in about 30 deep, lol, i know a servers nightmare!  Thankfully we had some seasoned servers and they knew how to handle a large crowd, service wise the place did great! The food on the other hand was not a great as I remember..... my daughter and I actually didn't want pizza and shared the avocado rolls and the mahi mahi tacos. Our rolls came out and they could have been so much more if they weren't cooked for so long, bleh! Avocado dredged in oil is no bueno! The tacos looked to yummy but the fish itself was dry and had no flavor. The only sauce they offered was salsa, maybe a white sauce of some type would help with the dryness and lack of flavor. Hint sight we should have said something but it took a while for the food and we where getting a little HANGRY!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-happy-valley

Amanda D.,"Eugene, OR",21,104,82,1.0,9/4/2016,Wow is all I have to say. We were seated for 10 minutes without being acknowledged by any of the servers. Other people that got seated after us were served before we were even acknowledged. We got up and left and didn't even get an apology. I love CPK and have been to many different ones but this particular location is HORRIBLE. Don't even bother coming here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-happy-valley
Mike D.,"Oregon City, OR",0,3,,1.0,6/29/2017,"Absolutely horrible. I came in and there was a big group of 50ish kids. Instead of cooking other patron's orders along side their pizza order, the kitchen decided to cook ALL individual pizzas first, then serve everyone else. No warning, no notice. Just didn't cook my pizza. Around 20 minutes later I thought to ask, and it was then that she checked and said it hadn't even started making it, yet along cooking it. Needless to say, I did not stay and wait. I highly recommend other pizza places near by. You will get served much quicker, and with better service. In fact, Claim Jumper is right near by and serves great pizza. The worse part was when I was obviously mad, and they didn't care one bit. Life is too short to spend your life with people who don't care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-happy-valley
Mei W.,"Clackamas, OR",101,60,1049,3.0,12/5/2015,"We had kids with us so decided to stop by as it was close. We ordered the Hawaiian bbq chicken pizza. It was good. One of the kids had the bolognese spaghetti and my daughter ordered the chicken piccata without the capers. The capers were left on. She decided to go ahead and eat it, electing to push them to the side since we had kids with us. It took a while for the waitress to get the bill to us. We had to ask for it as the kids were tired and wanted to go home.  All in all the food was okay and the service was a little slow. That is why I am giving 3 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-happy-valley
Anna C.,"Portland, OR",0,36,3,2.0,4/4/2017,Meh the chicken was so hard and dry I had to beat it like a drum. It's actually made noise. Sent back the Waldorf salad .... pass on it for sure.

Bre E.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,63,26,4.0,11/6/2016,Nice place! My family and I enjoyed our time here. Pizza was great. Service made sure we were taken care of the whole time. It is a business that likes to pull money out of your pocket. I feel the prices should have been a little more fair. Other than that a good place to go for a nice night away from home. I would recommend this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-happy-valley
Christy L.,"Portland, OR",0,13,10,5.0,10/25/2015,I really like this restaurant! There is also free wifi for those who need to save some data. Love the Kung pao spaghetti! It is my all time favorite!!!! The salad wraps are awesome too!  Everything here is good! The food the service and the atmosphere! Location is right with the Clackamas mall. I don't think I ever had a bad experience here. Only thing is that if u want their bread you need to ask. First couple times I never got bread and just thought they didn't have it but then saw some customers with it. I then asked the next time and they gave me bread. But only when I asked. Macho they charge for it? Hummmm should check my bill next time.  But all u gotta do is ask and u may get! Also careful the bread is kind of hard on the outside so don't forget your dentures or don't chew on a sore tooth!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-happy-valley

It is so nice to see consistency with a nation wide chain. Celae was super attentive to our needs and made our dining experience so enjoyable. The host, Juan, was also super friendly and kind.

Truely H.,"Oregon City, OR",0,21,,5.0,8/9/2017,My wife and I visited this restaurant for the first time. We had a very enjoyable salad and pasta dish. That being said there are lots of restaurants that serve good food but some are exceptional this is one of them. Also to be noted is how important The waiting staff and management treat you when you're trying to have an enjoyable night out. Our waiter was NJ And he was amazingly accommodating he did not over visit our table yet was always there to refill drinks and to answer any questions and recommend dishes. Thank you for a great experience NJ. The manager Nicci also came by to check on her experience and to confirm a free appetizer as first time patrons. Being guacamole fans we ordered the guacamole which was different than what we were expecting that was very enjoyable light and fresh. We will definitely be recommending this restaurant to others and will be returning soon I just hope they keep their customer service at such a high level.

Daniel G.,"Portland, OR",0,2,,5.0,5/24/2017,"Scene: You walk into a restaurant and you can smell the aroma fresh food entering into the gateway of your nostrils. Your mouth is salivating to the thought of having a full course meal. You see a smoking hot waitress or waiter walking you towards your table. As the they they set the menu down: You jump with joy as if you were jolted with hunger volts all throughout your body. You sit there looking over the menu contemplating which flavors you want to explore. Oh, man there are so many! I couldn't decide! Salmon, Pasta, Pizza, or even their fish tacos! It was definitely a difficult decision to make. I went ahead and got the Pesto Creme Penne. I also ordered a peach lemonade because I'm am pretty peachy. As I was waiting for my food, I looked around and saw how clean the restaurant was and how the people working here had the best attitude you could ask for. The seats were cozy, the tables were clean, everything about CPK is great. The sound of the people chattering and the music that it was playing truly created a perfect ambiance. Finally, my food has arrived and I'm super excited to just eat this mouthwatering pasta. Let me tell you something. With each bite that I took: My mouth had a huge party going on. All my papillae were going insane! Not to mention the peach mango! I think the peach mango put my papillae into overdrive! Filled with joy and also food, of course, I left home pretty happy because of the amazing food and exceptional customer service that they had provided. If you've haven't been to CPK located by the Clackamas Mall, well, you're missing out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-happy-valley?start=20
Erin H.,"Salem, OR",39,934,65,2.0,1/28/2013,"If i hadn't been so hungry.... ....I would have found a better place to eat. But there I was, sitting in my car reviewing Yelp after a 3 hours shopping trip to Macys, when I spotted CPK right across the parking lot. ""How bad could it be"" and ""It's better than waiting"" are certainly the two thoughts that caused me to pick up pizza here.  The service was incredible. On my way out with my to-go order I was offered an umbrella that I was free to return on my next visit. While I didn't take one, I appreciated the offer.  The pizza was definitely a ""meh"". I had the five cheese and tomato and while it filled my empty gut it didn very little for my taste buds. The crust was sweet and the rest of the stuff was bland. I got hubby some pepperoni and sausage thing; he liked it but  what does he know? :p There are much better options in Portland but I suppose if you're at the mall and really want pizza, it's better than Sbarro's, right? Right? Tell me I'm right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-happy-valley?start=20
Donna K.,"Portland, OR",119,226,174,4.0,11/12/2014,"Ahhh It's a chain restaurant, and I am giving them 4 stars!  They do really train their staff to be nice and caring, and it shows.  Everyone is always greeting and pleasant.  I would say I don't come here for the pizza alone.  The pizza is alright, what makes the pizza good is the flavor that the toppings add. The dough is nice and light which accommodates the distinctive flavors.  I personally like the bbq chicken.  I also like the mushroom truffle oil.  Also good is the lettuce wraps and salads.  Again full of flavor!  The portions are also really good!  The sangria red and white are super tasty on a hot day!  IF it's cold I usually get a beer.  Save room for the dessert because the butter cake taste like buttah.  No really, it melts in your mouth and you certainly feel guilty for eating a cake called butter cake, but what do you expect when the words, Can I have the butter cake comes out of your mouth as the waitress takes down your order.  You might as well get it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  So recap:  This chain restaurant does not have unique pizza or flavors, but the overall experience leaves me coming back every once in a while from the service to the appetizers, to salad and pizza, to drinks and desserts.  It's a whole package deal at this chain restaurant! Bonus:  They have little plates in case you are on a diet, which is available all day long.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-happy-valley?start=20

Jennifer L.,"Vancouver, WA",105,499,248,4.0,2/24/2012,I love CPK's Small Cravings menu. It's perfect for people like me who wants to try a little bit of everything. My favorite is the Korean Beef Taco and Asparagus Arugula Salad. I prefer the taco with a wedge of lemon instead of lime though. My one-year-old loves the asparagus in that salad.  Their staff were helpful and friendly and their restrooms were clean and non-smelly; it also has a changing table.

Melissa W.,"Vancouver, WA",31,60,3,2.0,5/29/2013,"I was here this weekend with my husband's family.  It was ok, but not excellent.  We had an extremely long wait for a table, but we had a sort of large group (10) so that can be expected. Finally we were seated and ordering drinks and a late lunch.  The plus?  The half salads are huge!  The negative to that?  I ordered the Classic Caesar Salad with chicken.  It had no flavor.  In fact, I think they forgot the dressing altogether.  It also had no lemon wedges.  I don't think I've ever ordered Caesar and not gotten lemon.  I'm not kidding about the dressing being non-existent.  I typically think salads have too much dressing.  There was no dressing and no flavor whatsoever but after such a long wait for the table and a pretty long wait for our food, I wasn't sending it back- I was so hungry.  There was quite a bit of shaved Parmesan cheese on it and about 2 croutons.  Over all it was super disappointing. I also had a half slice of my husbands ""Meat Lover"" pizza.  It was seriously lacking flavor as well.  Except for a very strange sweet honey flavor- not a good kind of understated sweet honey flavor to contrast the salty meats, but kind of an overwhelming sickeningly sweet honey flavor and the meats weren't salty really or flavorful at all, just bland. Overall this dining experience was pretty disappointing.  They did do well at refilling our ice teas and lemonades.  The kids enjoyed their meals for the most part.  I'd start listing other restaurants that I like around there, but that would be rude.  It will suffice to say I'll be dining elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-happy-valley?start=20
Marilynn L.,"Los Angeles, CA",126,1229,132,3.0,8/5/2013,The new dough is less heavy - more airy and light.

Yasa P.,"Happy Valley, OR",3,49,12,2.0,10/14/2014,"Tried this place several times, and there are pros and cons. Pros: MOST of the time, you'll be seated and attended to fairly quickly. The food is A-OK, nothing really special, I like their ravioli and Hawaiin pizza, but their basily pasta dishes are disgusting. Don't try it, unless you know with certainty that you enjoy bland, luke-warm, and dry spaghetti. The servers are friendly; I came in a couple months ago for my year and a half anniversary with my boyfriend for a quick dinner, and the server was accommodating and agreed to take pictures of us, which I appreciated. Also, they keep the place pretty clean, warm, and pleasant. CONS: WAYYYYYYY OVERPRICED. The food, the drinks, all of it. I agree with many of these reviews stating things like ""over-priced franchise garbage."" Maybe it's not all garbage, because you can get a halfway decent meal, but it definitely is NOT worth what you end up paying for it. Appetizers are pretty ok, I did enjoy the Thai chicken rolls with sweet sauce, but eveerything else is mediocre.

Even though the staff came and checked with us multiple times, including being introduced to the chef who made out pizza, the manager and possibly the owner, the experience didn't live up to other CPKs I've been too. The salad didn't seem fresh and the pizza was more oily than usual. I'd have to say the location in Bridgeport is better.

Joshua M.,"San Diego, CA",204,1480,170,5.0,6/11/2011,"CPK gets my 1000th review. Congratulations CPK! Alright let me first start off by saying I've eaten at a lot of these restaurants, and my experiences are never all that memorable.  I'm not really the gourmet pizza type, and I'm always apt to right a place off in my book that uses the word California in their title or anything on the menu.  Typically it just equates to avocado being dumped on something or some extra nutty wheat bread.  Usually my typical order there is the thai chicken pizza minus the onions, because the standard fare pizza that CPK makes is pretty lackluster.  This time around they way overdid it on the bean sprouts, but it's my 1000th review so I'm forgiving. What did stand out about my experience here was our waiter Christian.  First off in general Portland servers are HORRIBLE.  Seriously folks I've lived in a few cities and by far the servers in Portland are the worst.  They are usually nice, which is the most annoying part because you want to hate them but you can't.  Niceness aside, they usually are so appalling slow that the simple 30-45 minute meal possible in any other city turns into a 1-2 hour test of patience.   Christian was hardcore, totally the anti-Portland server.  Friendly, AWAKE, seemed to be really enjoying his job, and totally on top of everything.  He suggested to my wife to have some goat cheese on her pasta and if she didn't like it he'd buy the dish.  Whoa.  I wish I had that much energy. What normally would be a 3 star rating gets an extra star for Christian's zaniness, and an extra 1000th review star for being at the right place at the right time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-happy-valley?start=40
F T.,"Portland, OR",0,6,,1.0,9/15/2014,"This place is over-priced garbage. Nothing is fresh, if the ingredient can be bought frozen then it is.

mel p.,"Santa Cruz, CA",112,133,101,4.0,5/29/2011,"We met friends for lunch and they got to pick the place. They decided on CPK. By far the best ""chain pizza"" I have had.    Emily and I shared a small cobb salad, -minus chopped egg. The small side was totally enough for two of us to share and the ingredients were of quality We ended up ordering a pretty good spread between the four of us. I ordered the Four Seasons pizza. It was so tasty topped with imported Italian tomatoes, oven-roasted artichoke hearts, salami, fresh mushrooms, mild onions, Mozzarella and fresh Mozzarella cheeses. Topped with fresh herbs and Parmesan cheese. Emily ordered Chicken Tequila Fettuccine. I had to taste this, it looked so good and smelled delicious. Not bad at all. It was made up of nice ingredients like Spinach fettuccine with chicken, red, green & yellow peppers, red onions and fresh cilantro in a tequila-lime and jalapeño cream sauce. Everything just seems fresh.  Our lunch-mates ordered the Spinach Artichoke Dip. They seemed to like it but I was not much of a fan myself. I have had many a tasty spinach dip and this just was not cutting it. I can not even put my finger on it really. Just over-all not very good. They also ordered the Margherita pizza. It looked delish but I did not try it. Our mates seemed to enjoy it though. It also had great toppings like imported Italian tomatoes, Mozzarella and fresh Mozzarella cheeses topped with fresh basil and Parmesan cheese.  We ordered sodas,tea and a couple brews on tap that did the job.  The service was pretty good to. The server kept my soda glass full. This place is huge step above other chain pizza joints.

Mallory K.,"Portland, OR",18,33,,1.0,7/15/2014,"I do not know why I ever go back here!  I can safely say this location has the worst service of any restaurant in the Portland metro area.  Yes even after Mcmenamins!  My last visit was this past Saturday at about 3pm.  First off, there was no hostess although there was probably only 6 tables eating.    We had to be seated by the buss boy that just happened to walk by and once we got seated we were not greeted for about 5 minutes.  We placed our order of a salad an appetizer and waited.  Salad came out, no appetizer...""it will be right out.""  Then after half way through our salad the server came back to inform us that the appetizer was never prepped for the day so if we still wanted it it would be 8 more minutes.  We said we would still like it since all we had was a salad.  The appetizer came out once we were done with the salad, but it was WRONG!  He apologized that it was wrong and said he would have them make it again and would take it off the bill.  That was a nice gesture but all these things should never have happened with 7 tables in the restaurant.  Do not go here...drive to Bridgeport if you want CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-happy-valley?start=60

Brian I.,"West Linn, OR",62,256,33,4.0,3/2/2011,"If it walks like a 3-star review, talks like a 3-star review and even looks like a 3-star review, then it's probably a 3-star review, right?  Not in the case of California Pizza Kitchen. I've been to CPK twice; both times for lunch.  Previously I'd had the fish tacos, and they were really good! Perfectly cooked and nicely seasoned, I was pleasantly surprised.  Today I had the California Club foccacia sandwich (with turkey) and it, too, was dang tasty!  Fresh, ample chunks of avocado were a highlight of the sandwich for me.  I chose the slaw as a side and could have done without.  Too salty for my liking. Service was speedy, and I appreciate that at lunchtime.  I think, perhaps, the real kicker for me was the quality of my drink.  In my opinion, the quality of a restaurant's Arnold Palmer tells a lot about the place.  Despite being such a simple drink, it's easy to screw up.  Poor quality iced tea, lemonade or a combination of the two can make it awful.  This is without mentioning the potential for a poor mix.  Not at CPK, that's for sure.  You can order one with confidence here! So, yeah, it's easy to dismiss chain restaurants as 3 star (or worse) experiences.  I'm not going to pigeon-hole CPK like that.  I think the food and service deserves better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-happy-valley?start=60

Oindrila M.,"Portland, OR",26,37,9,3.0,9/9/2011,"Went in with very high expectations as I was told by my colleagues that its THE best pizza place in town. I agree they have a few exotic toppings which you won't find in any regular pizza place like pizza hut or dominos, but I didn't feel that they were that out of the world.  Plus they had the worst wait time ever. Went in for a team lunch on a Thursday a little after noon. The place looked pretty empty to me so not sure what the delay was for.  We ordered drinks, appetizer and about 7 or 8 pizzas. The drinks (water,  lemonades and a couple of fruit punches) arrived after about an hour, then after another 30-40min came 1 appetizer. Finally the pizzas arrived after about an hour and a half from the time we ordered. You'd think that after such a long wait they would be some pretty exotic pizzas. Yes they were different no doubt (with guacamole and tzatziki sauce, etc) but they  didn't taste anything extraordinary. On the contrary, the Thai Chicken Pizza was  too salty. Didn't experience the 'wow' factor. And they were definitely not worth the long wait time!  I'd settle for the regular toppings from pizza hut if I have to wait this long to get a bite of their exotic pizza.  If they improve on their service, it might then be worthwhile to make a second visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-happy-valley?start=60

Milla M.,"Portland, OR",0,33,,1.0,7/7/2013,"I went with my friend a while back after walking through the mall. The restaurant itself was very clean and nice looking. We were seated quickly since it was a very slow day. The waitress was nice, however was non existent except to take our order and bring us our food and check. Never did she come back to see how things were or if we need refills on our drinks. We ordered a Canadian bacon pizza to share. I myself am not picky about pizza. I'll eat most pizza's as long as it has toppings I like. This pizza tasted like a frozen tostino's pizza. I actually dont mind those kinds of pizza's, so I did eat it. However it was no where near good enough to be priced that much.

I K.,"Beaverton, OR",3,57,48,3.0,1/22/2012,"Was in for lunch. Had a pasta dish, it tasted like it was from a box, it was a pesto pasta pene dish, it was gross. It was undercooked and oddly was missing oils so it was very dry. The pizza was decent, but was very expensive. The exotic teas are really just bar drinks with sugary syrup. They tasted good, but were very artificial despite asking my server for a low sugar tea, don't like any sugar at all, i ended up with a horribly sweet beverage. I think this is more a of a reflection on the franchise food then the quality of this particular restaurant. I did not seem to have anything that was above what you could find in a box in the grocery store or frozen food aisle in a standard grocery store. The allure of this restaurant is lost on me from this visit.  The service at this location was attentive and the visual appeal of this restaurant was pleasant.

I was excited to see that the Pear and Gorgonzola pizza is back on the menu, woo hoo.  It didn't taste as good as I remember though, the pears tasted different.  Normally the pears are quite sweet which complements the Gorgonzola perfectly but these pears were a bit bland.  I kept saying to Paul, they just don't taste like pears!  But, the crust was cooked perfectly and overall the pizza was good. Paul got the Mango Tandoori Chicken pizza and he really liked it.  He said that there were too many pieces of mango on it, I guess it was overpowering the other toppings.  The mango looked great to me though!   The folks that work there are super nice, a bit too nice actually.  Very over the top!  But, whatever, it is a great option for lunch in Clackamas!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-happy-valley?start=60
