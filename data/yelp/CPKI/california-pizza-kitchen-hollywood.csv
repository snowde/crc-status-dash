Rose B.,"Imperial Beach, CA",16,33,15,1.0,1/13/2018,"This rating is based on the service we experienced. Late last month, myself and a party we're waiting for a table during the late afternoon and was told by the hostess that the wait would be about 20 minutes. So we outside with the other parties that were also waiting to be seated. After 15 minutes, we checked to see how far on the list we would be seated with the second hostess. We then noticed some guy go over the fence into the outside patio, waved his friends over to sit at an empty table, and then sat down. Rather than the hostess asking them to leave and wait like the everyone else, he brought their menus and had a waiter come to take their order. Several of us were upset that he allowed this to happen. One of my friends then went inside to see if they were that busy as both hostesses claimed. He said there were eight empty (cleaned and set) tables inside. When he came back out, he told the first hostess (the one that put us on the waitlist) about it and she said we still had to wait. Mind you within 20 minutes we were waiting, only two parties were seated and several more still waiting. This restaurant clearly has poor communication with its staff and needs improvement in order to provide better service for their customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hollywood
Emily P.,"Derwood, MD",88,16,,1.0,11/11/2017,"Update: I've changed this to one star because I have since had a reaction to that pizza, so it was contaminated with gluten somehow. Luckily I don't have a life-threatening allergy, but for anyone who does, avoid this place. -- Got the gluten-free Margherita pizza to-go. Crust was burnt. Cheese was tasteless. Barely any tomatoes, about 5 small pieces on the entire pizza. Giving this two stars instead of one only because the employees were courteous and accommodating with my allergy and the basil on the pizza was the right amount. I'm not one to leave bad reviews because I'm not very picky but overall the pizza was bad and horribly overpriced ($20!!) Definitely not coming back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hollywood
Linda S.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,169,142,3.0,10/27/2017,"A hit or a miss. The food is good but the service can either be good or terrible.  FOOD: The pizzas are generally good and can be shared between 2 people. My favorite is the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Pizza.  Their salads are good as well.  MUST TRY: Definitely get the sangria flight! You get three different kinds of sangria with fruit. Sooo good!  It is something I order every time I'm there.  SERVICE: This location is in Hollywood. So there is usually a flow of customers. But even after being seated by the hostess, it was so hard to get the server's attention to even order. During some visits, the servers don't come so I have to ask the hostess to get our server. In the end, the hostess just took our order and served us instead. (Thanks girl, you da VIP) Tips: Parking is usually validated ($2.00 for 2 hours) BUT IF YOU PARK AFTER 10PM, YOU HAVE TO PAY A FLAT RATE OF $15.00! This is even if you came a few minutes before 10pm, apparently (i.e. 9:55pm). So keep this in mind.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hollywood

Jennifer S.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",334,316,1419,1.0,10/19/2017,"300! I've been holding off on my 300th review for something extraordinary.  THIS was simply AMAZING. My family and I were heading over to see Janet in concert (Miss Jackson if ya nasty) at the Hollywood bowl. We left ourselves ample time to eat here and walk over to the bowl, which was about 2 hours and some change. We waited 30 mins for a table. We get in, order, and pay the check immediately so we wouldn't have to wait at the end, and we could just head to the concert fast. We ordered drinks (there were only 3 of us) and waited. Drinks come. We start noticing though that people around us are being sat... and are eating, but our food has yet to make an entrance. This is after like 30 mins of waiting. We ask our waitresses what's going on with our order, and she goes to ""check"". We wait... from my brothers vantage point, he can see her in the kitchen, so of course i turn around to look.  She's arguing with the chef. Someone lost the order ticket. NO FOOD WAS COMING! Omfg!  We asked to see a manager. Now we legit have to sit though a 2 hour concert STARVING. We can't even believe it, but think for sure the manager is going to fix things. Here he comes... with a bill! ""Sorry guys. Sometimes things like this happen."" Then he hands my boyfriend a bill... ""what's THIS?"" ""Oh sorry ya, your drinks weren't added to the bill you pre paid. I refunded it, but not the drinks"". ARE. YOU. FUCKING. SERIOUS? I've never experienced this in all my life. Lol... you would think with such a HUGE fuck up, they'd offer a gift card? Drinks on the house?  Something?  Nah... and YES the waitress knew we were going to the concert. Never eat here. Horrible NON SERVICE.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hollywood
Joanna K.,"Manhattan, NY",133,15,14,1.0,12/17/2017,"We went to order take out for the first time on our way home from Runyon.  We figured we order something healthy since we just got back from our hike.  I ordered the banh mi power bowl and my fiancé ordered the Santa Fe power bowl.  We were looking forward to enjoy our lunch since we were super hungry.  When we opened the box, we were disappointed to see 5 whimpy pieces of chicken.  $14.99 is not a lot of money but it is over priced for the quality that you get.  I should've made my own salad at home instead.  Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hollywood
Francine L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1577,1658,3141,3.0,3/29/2017,"I've been eating a lot of CPK and they have changed from years ago. Came here for a dinner after walking around and being a tourist around Hollywood.  They give you bread and the dipping sauce is so tasty. For appetizers we ordered two which was avocado with chips and avocado deep fried rolls. I've been on a binge on eating lots of avocado. It's pretty tasty but the portion size for the avocado and chips is really small. Ordered a Thai pizza and a salad. There are plenty of options for pizza and salad. They are popular for pizza so I would suggest order a pizza.  It is a lot of carbs so I would say if you aren't a diet than this place is pretty alright.

Kasey D.,"Winter Garden, FL",72,95,472,2.0,9/4/2017,"Let me start off by saying... I have been to CPKs before and I have had a much better experience than what we had last night.  It was slow for a Sunday night and basically everything else around was already closed. We got out of seeing A Goofy Movie at El Cap and wanted some dinner. We walked across the street and found CPK. The hostess stand out front was empty but had a sign telling us to ""See Hostess for Seating"". In my mind that is telling me to go inside the restaurant and find the hostess or anyone to find a table. The three of us walk in and IMMEDIATELY the hostess comes around the corner to accost us. She tells us that we were supposed to be waiting outside and the sign told us so. I told her no the sign told us to see the hostess so I came to find you. She was very rude and just pointed to a table and gave us some menus and had us sit there. She didn't even walk us to the table. I wish I had gotten her name because I wanted to make sure someone knew about it with every last detail but after that she was no where to be seen for the rest of the night.  Our waitress was friendly and took our drink order right away and when we ordered food the food came out quick. The place was very slow compared to all the hustle and bustle outside on the street at Hollywood blvd. The food was okay just as it always is. I think at the later hour that it was we just wanted something to eat rather than fight the crowds down on the sidewalks to find something better to eat. It was also weird to me that we were eating at 9:30 at night and a lot of restaurants closed at 10pm even in one of the busiest parts of LA. I will have to say though that experience makes to not have great feelings about returning to a CPK, rude staff, bland pizza, and a menu that I haven't seen changes in a long time. Also there was no bread given. The last CPK I went to in Honolulu gave us bread before our meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hollywood
Ruby S.,"Glendale, CA",140,335,385,4.0,5/17/2017,Service was great. There is a lot of parking but make sure you validate your ticket. I was there for about 3 hours and I had to pay $5 with validation. I tried the shrimp Scampi pasta because it was listed under favorites... it was not good! Lol I was with two other people and they tried it and agreed. It had absolutely no flavor and the portion was small. That plate is not worth $15.99 and it's not worth being under the favorites on the menu. We also got the Carne Adada pizza. This is a new pizza and it was surprisingly good. I tried all the lemonades they have ( they are refillable) my favorite one was the Peach flavor,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hollywood
Shay N.,"Beverly Hills, CA",165,151,127,5.0,3/6/2017,"Update of my review::: After posting about my past experience at this location, the manager was extra nice and reached out to help resolve the issue. I've never seen a restaurant be so concerned about a customer who had a bad experience at their place. It really did surprise me. I would definitely come to this location again because of the excellent effort their staff has shown me. Thank you.  ---------------------------------- Of course the food is good at CPK, but I'm writing this review because the customer service for this location was horrible. Our waiter was nice but we sat outside and we were forgotten. It wasn't even that busy. We got ONE cup of water the entire time. No one checked on us, and when I asked for the check, we had to wait half an hour because no one would bring it out. Ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hollywood
Sir S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,5,5.0,10/14/2017,"Okay, so it's literally across the street from my residence. I've been going off and on for years & I've had 30-40% of the menu selections; I can't remember any complaints in the past as far as quality, freshness, temperature, or presentation of the dish.  Their oven for pizza baking is interestingly interesting, so say the least. Prices are fairly reasonable; managers are active on the floor & from time to time will introduce themselves to the seated guests when duty hasn't solicited them elsewhere.  The only thing that really set me off with the pay system at this establishment is at the bottom of the receipt it breaks down the tipping amount based on one's individual tab in increments of 15, 18, & 20%. Again, that's based on the cost of the tab & is quite helpful as far as illuminating one having to calculate.  The problem is they base tip recommendations on the entire tab (including the tax) and that's not supposed to be.  EXAMPLE: if my meal total is $5 & with tax it's $5.45  the tip recommendation chart of 15, 18, or 20%, is supposed to be on the $5, not the $5.45. Where is it written that we're supposed to tip tax?  Please tell me because I do stand to be corrected if I'm wrong. But the tax wasn't served to me on a plate nor did the tax give me service, so why should I tip a tab whose total includes the tax? Yes, the $5 is taxable, hence the $5.45, but the $5 alone is what I'm supposed to tip (if I choose), not the $5.45.  I brought it to the attention of my waiter who was working the bar that particular day, but it was kinda' shrugged off as if it was nonexistent. I don't think anyone has ever challenged it or paid any attention to it, but I caught the subliminal trick of mild robbery. gain, I stand to be corrected; each one teach one and I strive to learn something new every day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hollywood

Dessert.  Yes, we ordered dessert and a fifth round of drinks.  :-) Overall the experience was great, the servers were on point and on time, and the food was excellent even though we were starving and would have eaten bark off a tree at that point.

My guest and I were commenting on how many of the employees had their hair in a bun we found it quite entertaining. The food is overpriced and under flavored. Spaghetti Bolognese was a small portion and it was very dry seemed like it had been created almost like a cookie-cutter fast food recipe approach no passion. The pizza had mushrooms that were bad tasting & on the verge of being just bad as in rotting and my guest suffered stomach issues for the rest the day afterward.

The waiter came to our table saying he was our server for a day. He was no where to be seen after he got our orders for a drink and our order for the food. We were about to order our food but he was NOWHERE to be seen. I could see just WALKING AROUND DOING NOTHING. I couldn't get his attention so I asked someone else. It was a young lady and she said she will get him for us. We ordered the food but AGAIN he gave ZERO F about us. I could clearly see him so he never clocked out. I was not able to get his attention. He walks by us and I called his name. He just walks pass by us casually. HORRIBLE SERVICE. The same young lady got our food for us. I wanted a refill of my drink but I couldn't because more people came in and it was just impossible to ask for a drink to different waiter/waitress. It was a DISASTER. By the way it wasn't even that busy when we came here. A lot of people but not that many to forget who you are serving.  I have been to multiple CPK and correct me if I am wrong but does this CPK let you walk in and out from the kitchen? Because they clearly give ZERO F and don't care what you need. It is IMPOSSIBLE to ask for more water. WATER! For those who is going to come here, I think you can walk in and grab anything you want from the kitchen. There aren't any servers so no one cares.

The hostess explained that only one side of the patio was open. Again? Geez, the show lets out we are a little humid because we are warm and we HOPE that some time in fresh air is available. That would be too perfect. Instead, we are forced to sit inside the bar. Our first inclination is to belly up but there are used plates and utensils strewn about. After standing there for a few minutes the bartender acknowledges our existence understanding some primping of the area in front of us is needed. We are standing for a few minutes MORE when we realize he has no intention of taking care of this issue quickly. We find a bar top and notice many tables with remnants of patrons past. Dirty dishes, food, glasses and so on. I hate to be prissy but this is Saturday FREAKIN' night and crowds are expected especially with it being a concert night.  Either the restaurant was improperly staffed or management was lacking BIGTIME!! Needless to say we had some time to kill with two bottles of Pinot from Buena Vista in Sonoma. I have to admit that I was livid and uncomfortable for a while until the infusion of fermented wine grapes relaxed me. Dontae' was our server and he was congenial and attentive.

Normally when you price a steak that high, it should come out good. It was totally undercooked. I said medium rare and it was basically cut off the cow and just warmed up. They had to throw it back on. The flavor wasn't very good. The worst part was the hard fat all through steak. Half of it was not even edible. I never should have paid for that.

Ben R.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,6,11,1.0,7/25/2016,"As a former server I usually do not like throwing people under the bus, but this time I really need to make an exception. I have been to this location dozens of times and I've never been provided with such sub-par service. My friends and I all had crazy, long days of work, and the place was decently busy but we all had a hankering for our CPK favorites. We got seated, and as soon as Trenton walked up to us (after 15 minutes and only after my fiancé went over and complained to someone) we immediately knew we were in trouble. He was spaced out, sluggish, hard to communicate with, and we had to repeat our orders multiple times because every time he'd read them back it's all be wrong. He made us all extremely uncomfortable with the way he presented himself, and we all braced ourselves for what we knew would be a terrible meal. We didn't get drinks (or the water we requested) for ten plus minutes, and three other tables with people who'd arrived after us were getting their food. I approached Trenton about this and asked him if we could expect our food soon, as we had been waiting over thirty minutes and we hadn't seen him at all. He gave me a patronizing look, as if it were amusing, and made up a bunch of excuses I knew to be untrue. Over then next fifteen minutes he brought each of our dishes one at a time, and once it was all set down we didn't see him again for twenty more minutes. The whole time he moved slow as molasses and seemed to be extremely spaced out. My fiancé and I had not expected to be there so long, and we both had to be up for work at the crack of dawn and had to leave early. Those of you that have been to CPK know that the average turnaround time is no more than 40 minutes. We were there for nearly two hours. Like I said at the beginning, I was a server and used to get peeved when I got these kind of complaints, but I worked at a fine dining restaurant, and Trenton would've gotten the boot in less than a week.

And while all of their staff does a good job, I'm particularly grateful for the hostess, Mary, who always deals with all the little requests and nuances of my order and does it with a sincere smile. To the management, and from one employer to another -- if you fail to acknowledge talent you're likely to lose it. My recommendation would be to make her a server. Your customers deserve her level of service -- and she in turn, deserves a position which is paid for their level of performance, not just attendance.

Jessica M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",84,38,7,1.0,6/26/2017,"This place was a total joke. The waitstaff and servers do not have leadership or training that enable them to be able to deal with the amount of volume of traffic this place gets. They will basically take in the most frustrated or inpatient people before the people who wait their turn. I guess they get so much business that they don't really have to strive for excellence. We called ahead with a large group and were told 30 minutes. When we checked in at the desk we were told 10 minutes. An hour and a half later with many many check ins, we were still not seated. We continued to ask for a ballpark time so we can adjust our plans. We were finally told that were next.  Then, a group of the same size as ours get seated before us! I walked up to tell the server that we were there much longer waiting before. One of the ladies in the party looks to me and says a racist comment about how Caucasian people are always sat before her race and how this restraint is racist if they don't seat them next. Then they are seated. I talk to the manager and asked why they were seated and he said because they made a racist comment pulled the ""race card"" and they had to protect the restaurant.  Anyway I thought it was ridiculous and we ended up all getting split up because they couldn't accommodate us after that.

It seems California Pizza Kitchen has become a staple every time my sister, my good friend and I celebrate the end of a busy work week. This CPK is actually very convenient as it is in the Hollywood & Highland area - the place where all the action happens! Located in the The H&H structure, parking & getting around is not at all a problem. For starters try the Spinach Artichoke dip---definitely a must! If you are craving for the nice warm bread to start, you have to ask for it as it is not something that they automatically bring to your table anymore ( great idea to avoid unnecessary waste! ) Let's get on to the food! I had the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine- great choice! The pasta was cooked to perfection, the chicken pieces - hefty & well seasoned, the sauce was creamy, buttery, with a hint of citrus - the meal was delicious!   My sister had the Kung Pao Spaghetti which she had me try - OMG! it was so good! It was the perfect twist to something we commonly think as an Italian dish! The Kung Pao spaghetti is gluten free! and for peeps allergic to peanuts, you could request it to be ""off"" the dish. The four cheese ravioli which my good friend had was scrumptious! (of course my fork dove in that plate too ha ha!) Little square temptations under the blanket of molten cheese and sauteed mushrooms, drizzled with fresh green basil ribbonettes, it smells fresh & rich!

Back to the review of CPK Hollywood ... Been here many times and it's always crowded but the wait moves along pretty quickly.  The place is clean and looks cool.  The staff are attentive and always seem to get the orders right.  I like this place, because it's a just a little teeny bit off the main drag where all the crazies are but close enough you can get your whacko fix within a minute assuming you don't stop by Papa's right down the stairway (which is a must). I'm a little angry that they got rid of the BLT Pizza!  I loved that one because the lettuce was finely chopped and the pizza tasted just like a BLT sandwich.  Yum.  Instead they killed that entree and substituted a ""California Club"" the waiter says.  It's just like the BLT but it also includes chicken.  Okay, what the heck?  So, out comes the pizza and it's basically a full on mixed greens salad placed right on top of the pizza.  With the BLT at least you could pick it up and eat it without having that much fall off.  These are huge pieces of lettuce that you need to cut with a knife before you can insert it in your mouth!  So, I pick up a slice as carefully as possible and at least 80% of the salad falls to the plate just as I get it in my mouth.  So, I end up having a few more slices, then grab my fork and eat my ... side salad.  Maybe it's executed nicely in the kitchen, but I doubt the chef has actually eaten this mess.  Now it was tasty, but not what I expected. The rest of the group got pepperoni pizzas and fish tacos.  All of it was great and we didn't even ask for a doggie bag this time.  Two beers and a pizza!  Buuuuurp!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hollywood?start=160

We ordered the tortilla spring rolls, specifically the Mediterranean veggie and Baja chicken. Both were great, the perfect nosh to keep us tied over until our main course, the artichoke and spinach pizza.

I noticed how people who signed in later but were seated earlier than us.  Environment: Good lighting and green plants. I like the general atmosphere even though it could have been quieter. The background pop music did not really match my expectation, but since this is a family restaurant, I shouldn't expect too much.  Serving: We waited for about 10 to 15 minutes before a waiter came to us and took the order. Before he came, there was no waiter around in the area we were seated, and everyone else seemed so busy.

Sara C.,"Seattle, WA",723,573,796,4.0,8/3/2011,"This is not my first time at a California Pizza Kitchen, but this is the first time I've been very satisfied with a CPK! After slapping our shoes against the pavement of the walk of fame, fitting our hands in the molds of those of celebrities in front of the Chinese Theater, and admiring the famous Hollywood sign from a far, we realized it wouldn't hurt to get a bite to eat. Thankfully, we found California Pizza Kitchen before I got too loopy from hunger. We were seated quickly and were left to ponder over the menu. After some rumination, the five of us decided to split a Jamaican Jerk pizza and a Thai Chicken pizza. The waiter warned us that between all five of us, we would still be left hungry if we stuck with ordering only two pizzas. We were adamant about our decision.... unfortunately, the waiter was right. The pizzas were pretty small, but the waiter made it clear that they would be. Our Jamaican Jerk pizza definitely had a good kick. The typical ingredients in anything jamaicany or jerky were there. As someone noted, each bite of this pizza was different. On the other hand, though the Thai Chicken pizza was savory and was smothered in a great peanut sauce, every bite was just the same as the last. Nonetheless, both pizzas were very good. Each of us had two pieces, and when we got down to the last two, there was some hesitation as to who would take them. Thankfully, two brave volunteers stepped up to the challenge before all hell broke loose. I don't think I'll make the trip to Hollywood just for some CPK for a while, but if you're in Hollywood, CPK is definitely a great place to grab some grub!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hollywood?start=120

They used to make it with eggs, but I believe they stopped. Honestly, I prefer it better this way!  I think the biggest and only regret I've had about a dish at CPK, was the CheeseBurger Pizza, which in fact, tasted exactly like a cheesebuger! It wasn't bad, but it wasn't something I'd want to try again, nor would I ever reccomend it. It's also off the menu now in most resturaunts. This place is VERY family friendly!

I had the spicy Chipotle Chicken Pizza and found it be mostly Mexican beans and corn rather than the spicy chicken that I was expecting. I felt that that the Chipotle theme had been liberally extended to a more general Mexican theme which did not work for me. My friend had a pasta dish and said that it was bland to the extent of lacking any seasoning and I had to warn him from going overboard on the chili flakes that he was mixing in to help gulp it down.

Zoie H.,"Los Angeles, CA",2280,807,1539,1.0,5/18/2012,"Sometimes it is great to have family in town. You get to hang out with people that you haven't seen in a very long time, you get to show off the fabulous town you live in, and you get to have a reason to pig out. But unfortunately one of the downsides with tourists is sometimes they want to go places that you know suck - but you have to humor them. That was our experience here yesterday. Thankfully, my boyfriends aunt gave us gift cards so we had $30 to spend which wasn't ours. Our bill came to $7 after taking the gift cards into account and I guess that that isn't too bad.  Service was the same kind of service that you would expect when everyone assumes you are a tourist. Too bad I work in this mall, and my boyfriend lives a block away. We are rather snobbish in the whole ""we're not tourists and therefore demand service"" aspect of things. We were seated immediately but then it took a good ten minutes to even see the patio server. He was okay, not the best. He only really stopped at the table when delivering food and drinks. When he was taking our food order (we wanted a pizza done half and half) it seemed to confuse him. He forgot our bread. We all left the table under the general impression that he was stoned.  Everyone else split the pizza which was about $11. I had the Kung Pao spaghetti which was about $10, but then to add chicken was an extra $3. I always remember it being super delicious with chicken but when it came to the table it had about 3 chunks of chicken in it (it used to be strips) and was definitely not worth the ""upgrade"". It was also incredibly spicy. I mean - I understand this is a spicy dish but I feel this one was overly spiced. The portion was a good size - I had enough to share at the table and take home for late night drunken leftovers.  Overall - thank the pizza gods we had a gift card! I would have been pissed if I had to throw down any more than $5 for this meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hollywood?start=140

If you do want pizza, I've tried the Blanca flatbread which was better than their regular pizzas in my opinion. The BEST item on their menu is the chicken tequila fettuccini!! And the BBQ chicken salad is tasty as well! These two dishes alone make up for the higher rating.

I can have an awesome experience one day, then an absolutely awful one on my very next visit. It's not just the service, but the food quality and it's something I don't understand, seeing as CPK is a chain, and consistency is something that should be standard, no matter what the location is.  I understand service can be hit or miss because sometimes people are just off. However, in this case, it must have been staff shortage because for some reason, our server had a very large station and several large parties. That left me and my friends constantly looking around for her, or for anyone for that matter - for service.  I don't know if the food quality is on me - or the chefs, as I didn't like my dish at all. I decided to try the Kung Pao Spaghetti and not only was it bland, there was no reason for the words 'Kung Pao' in the name because it wasn't spicy at all either. I'm sure it didn't help that I had just gotten back from China and was hoping for something more authentic and flavorful as the foods I enjoyed while there.

But as I looked around there were a couple of servers standing at a table, talking and doing nothing, which really annoyed me. The bartender finally took our order and we waited maybe about 45 minutes for our food...and I just ordered pasta! My boyfriend's pizza finished 15 minutes before mine actually finished. We should've just stayed there to eat! It was ridiculous. Also, the people next to us complained about their food as well. Their chicken was cold and they forgot grapes for his salad.

Ordered the avocado roll mmm nyam nyam. the dipping sauce was awesome as well... but i have a weird thing for avocado.. so lets just leave it like that. I ordered the baby clam linguini w/ cream sauce. HIGH FIVE it's usually good but this is the first time I've had it at this location. I usually go to burbank cause they do an awesome job there. It was a bit dry this time.. but all the flavors was there hence only -1 star. Splitted the 5 cheese w/ fresh tomatoes pizza. ALL I CAN SAY YOU MUST GET IT AND ROLL YOUR TOUNGE WITH THE TOMATO!! the flavor is sweet. if you just munch on it, it tastes like any other pizza but if you let the tomato sit on your tounge the flavors.. omg the flavors! i kid you not! the tiramisu.. i love tiramisu. i love it ALOT. if tiramisu was a person i would be hugging it and drolling all over it right now! (ok that didn't come out right but you get the point) It was nice to see a change to it with the mocha cream they poured over it.. the peach italian soda.. was hmm.. beautiful made me almost want to cry. heheh free refills... so i ended up getting like 4 refills. yes i love italian soda and if you have problem then go suck it up. last but not least. our waitress.

I have to admit that I do like some of the new menu items, and the strawberry basil martini is the perfect summer drink: delicious and refreshing.

The walk of fame lines the sidewalks, and with in walking distance is Grauman's Chinese Theater. Oh, yea, the food :) My better half had a personal pizza, pepperoni and sausage which was pretty good. I have a pasta, spicy chipotle fettuccine with chi cken, was delicious also.

I have found in Los Angeles that there are almost TOO MANY choices when it comes to just about everything, and some days I am just so exhausted at the thought of having to decide where to eat that I skip meals all together - enter California Pizza Kitchen. CPK is my go-to when I just don't know where to go to. With such a large menu, there is always something I want to eat. My absolute favorites are their chopped salad, white pizza, and mac-n-cheese. The thing about their mac-n-cheese is that you can order the kids' size and it is still HUGE and will only run you like $6! I always add grilled chicken pieces, so it ups the price to about $9, but still you can't beat a whole meal for less than $10 that is NOT fast food. The Hollywood/Highland location is obviously in a busy location, but I have never experienced a wait. I have done take-out on multiple occasions, as well as eaten at the bar and every time I am there the servers are attentive, the food is delicious, and everything is done in a timely manner.

Nine at night, your oven should be hot by now, right? That's just how they think pizza is supposed to be, I guess. Oven needs to be hotter on top and bottom. The dough reminded me of the  only time I ever had Little Caesar's pizza. I was at Kmart, famished, grabbed a slice out of desperation. It was junk pizza. Not saying CPK is junk pizza, but the dough (calling it ""crust"" is a misnomer here) is like that: bleh.  Service is good. Patio chairs are a laugh: miniature, wicker, bucket seats, sized for a child. Actually, they had to have been designed to hold a doll or a lawn elf or some other inanimate object. I'm 5'9"", average weight - this chair was like sitting on a tiny, twisted, wicker-wrapped jungle gym embedded with warped, cement skeeballs. I sat down, stood right back up and requested a new chair. I puzzled as I looked around and saw other patrons contentedly squashed into these atrocities: they must've been either too afraid to speak up, in a state of shock, pain, or denial, or, most likely, they were experiencing cognitive dissonance, reasoning that it is impossible that a restaurant would furnish itself with this torturous seating device and highly improbable that such an uncomfortable chair would be designed and manufactured to begin with. Therefore - they convinced themselves - they were enjoying a perfectly reasonable, average or better, level of seating comfort. If anything, I recommend going there and sitting in a patio chair. You will never experience anything like it anywhere else. p.s. I don't like it when people from the business respond to my review with some lame appeal, but of all the 1 and 2 star reviews (there are LOTS AND LOTS) - why respond to just *one*? Is the guy a food critic or something?   Weak.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hollywood?start=200

They cook the marinated beef into the pizza and then top it all with their own fresh version of kimchi. They use cilantro, which is not Korean at all, and because of this, if you ask for them to make it spicy, it will come out tasting exactly like Vietnamese bahn mi. IT""S AWESOME!

Valerie V.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,230,25,1.0,1/20/2013,"I'm a huge cpk fan for over 15 years. Been to almost every location from Manhattan Beach (corporate account regular) and all OC, LA/Valley areas. Dine in and curbside pick up. Practically memorize the menu.  We were debating on driving to Umami Burger or CPK (after seeing a show at El capitan) We chose cpk since it was family friendly. The hostess with short dark hair said it'll be 25min wait, so we decided to stay. After 30min, she told us it'll be another 10-15.hmmm...since we already waited, we decided to stay. Then after 1hour, she said ""you're next right after this other group"".  waiting... still not being seated and noticing tons of people being called.  So I politely asked the hostess again, what's going on, we've waited well over an hour and she said ""the time I gave you was just an estimate"". Then I said, that I noticed several people that came after us, being called up and she said (with a slight attitude) that they are being called because they had a smaller table.  (tables of 4, 5, 6 adults i don't think is fair to be seated first!) We were 4 adults, 2 babies (both 2 yr -not in highchairs) and an infant 6months.   I do think she forgot about us, because she had too look at the OTHER paper, for our names. Or perhaps, she wasn't paying attention to who was arrived early or not. I saw tables, that could've fit our party. I was pissed and wanted to leave, but everyone was just hungry and didn't feel like driving/waiting again elsewhere.  Finally they sat us after 1hour and 35min. (in the meantime a party of 3 who arrived AFTER us, already ate and was leaving) My friend told the other male hostess about our wait, and he got the manager, who was very apologetic and comped 2 small appetizers which came out quickly.  However, with babies, time is more valuable. If the hostess told us 45min wait in advance, we would've gone elsewhere.  They labeled us as a table of 7 AND included the automatic gratuity for a large party. (the infant doesn't even eat solids) and the toddlers just ate 1 pizza crust each and boxed the rest. Ironically, after all the wait, we weren't even seated at 1 table! Our hubbies sat in a separate booth across our booth. And the ""stroller"" which she added as the 7th person, had to be left in the front. (she also did not mention we couldn't take the stroller to the table even though i told her we had a stroller) We tried to make the best of the night. Food tasted as expected, although the pasta was tad more al dente. The star is for the nice manager comp, and our server was attentive and nice.

Bar none I have never had a more accommodating and eager to please dining experience with friends than at the Hollywood CPK, as we just showed up irritated and hungry, eager to see Tron at the El Capitan (with screaming kids!). The staff was made aware of our time issue, got our orders placed as they were setting up the table for us (in a HOLIDAY CROWD) and got us well fed and out the door with yummy doggie bags and holiday treats for the little (and not so little) ones. In about the same time it would have taken some less caring outfit to just sit us down to eat, we were already on our merry way.  It's one thing of one of the group feels that we should go back and tip them extra for the excellent service, it's another when it's unanimous and practically unspoken. Which itself was a good idea, as we had a more relaxed time to enjoy desserts (and waited out traffic) and then let the kids run loose around the fountain in the quad and play ""Tron"" until they wore themselves out. A nice long quiet drive home with everyone getting the most out of the evening. The staff was REALLY nice, like being back in high school with your classmates who worked at the favorite hang out. We had such a great time. Please be good to the staff there and they will be good to you as well.  About dessert:  White Chocolate Strawberry Cheesecake.

When Miss M. and I are out seeing a movie or whatever, it's nice to have a CPK nearby to get a discount meal that's pretty damn decent. In general, I really think that CPK has great salads, and pastas.  Their pizzas are pretty good but I don't care for the crust and I usually get my pizza Neapolitan style because I really prefer a thinner crust.  Nothing wrong with their signature pizzas, just my opinion. My biggest advice to anyone going to a CPK is that you don't have to get what they have on the menu.  If you see ingredients in other menu items that you like, put together your own thing!  I do it all the time and they don't mind doing it for you. Anyway, this CPK is pretty much in a tourist spot, but it's a great place to get dinner if you're seeing a movie at the Chinese or ElCapitan.  It's also great to have a Starbucks next door and Beard Papa's just down the way.  (That would be a really great evening: Movie [or whatever] CPK, Starbucks for coffee, then Beard Papa's for a cream puff to go with your coffee). I admire CPK for generally having a good staff.  They are usually friendly and nice.  Another recommendation, if there is a wait list for a table, eat at the counter!  You get to watch them make food, drinks, and you will have more interaction with the servers which I think makes their working time a bit more enjoyable. Food this night was good.  Cobb salad with beets!  Miss M is vegan but gets the Moroccan Chicken Salad without the chicken or egg.  A happy Miss M is a happy me. Besides, there's a dude there who's name is Raccoon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hollywood?start=240

So, we decided, let's try CPK for the first time. It's really just so-so. They have a wide variety of pizzas, and some sound quite exotic. We ordered 2 pizzas, since we have amazingly small appetites.  Italian Tomato and Basil, Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage. Nothing special.  Personally, the tomatoes? Kind of mushy and bland. Not ripe and juicy like the kind in taco salads even. Overall, the taste was okay, nothing special or mouthwatering. I liked how they had outdoor seating with heating though, it was quite enjoyable. Service was friendly enough, a tad slower than prefered. But maybe that's because we're used to quick and snappy Chinese restaurants, being a Chinese American.

I ordered the garlic cream fettuccine and opted for the chicken which is to my satisfaction. The only rant I have are the servings. My order appeared like I ordered from the kids menu!

The reason this location gets 5 stars is I've showed up within a minute of their ""closing time"" at least 5 times and they still let me in.  I usually spend a solid hour eating, talking and drinking with my friends.  Its sad, though, to see tourists turned away when they take their family to eat (and seeing a full, lively restaurant) that they are just too late to get in to. I'd also like to mention a handful of great servers I've had.  They are crazy busy yet so nice.  I really appreciate that.  Totally forgetful but I'd be too.  One of them even helped me with my Halloween costume shopping last year.  They recommended this local shop and it had just what I wanted.  Small town vibe in Hollywood - rare from what I've seen.

The seating arrangement is such that big groups tend to sit in the same vicinity where small couples and what not can sit in a more private area. This certain location is the only CPK I have been to that doesn't give out bread. However, the time between order and delivery as well as the quality of the food more than make up for the lack of bread. I've gone to this specific CPK around 4 times (almost every two months).

First, we venture up the infamous Hollywood Boulevard to the Kodak Theater complex.  Along the way, observe some interesting characters milling around and plenty of tourists either looking completely lost or taking pictures. Keep moving up the stairs of the complex, being careful of the tourists that suddenly stop in front of you to take a dozen pictures.  There will be a slight delay at the top due to more tourists taking pictures, particularly of the Hollywood sign off in the distance. Finally, as we arrive at CPK, be wary of the servers that have been mistreated and tipped very poorly all day.  At your final destination, be prepared to wait a long time for a table.  The pizza will be OK, but nothing spectacular.  At this CPK, it's all about location, location, location.

Fred C.,"Brooklyn, NY",144,200,25,2.0,1/25/2007,"California Pizza Kitchen put itself on the map by taking entrees that had little to no connection to Italy and throwing it on dough, and voila, California Pizza! Out-of-staters think this is normal for Californians to eat like this. Since most cannot afford to eat Wolfgang Puck food, CPK is more of the everyman's target. To CPK's credit, the pizzas it comes up with are very good. The ingredients are very inventive, and a personal-size pizza goes a long way. The same cannot be said for its pasta, which is just as expensive as a personal pie and fills like bread. CPK also homogenizes the crap out of its restaurants. It is martinet-like in its consistency, and now that these restaurants anchor just about every mall, the thrill is gone. The dining experience in this CPK is less than thrilling. This is the most tourist-trap location in Southern California, and it is always crowded and service is slow and stagnant. A three-star CPK experience can be had by leaving Hollywood & Highland for the less crowded Beverly Center and two downtown Los Angeles locations. Take the Red Line to downtown or the DASH Hollywood/West Hollywood line to Beverly Center. Transit access: Metro Red Line, Metro Rapid Line 780, and local lines 2/302, 156, 163, 180/181, 212 and 217; and LADOT DASH Hollywood, Hollywood/West Hollywood and Holly Trolley.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hollywood?start=280

grace b.,"Irvine, CA",39,72,,1.0,7/13/2008,"I'm not really a CPK fan. Sure I've eaten at CPKs every now and again, but it's not exactly the place I'd choose to go get something to eat. I mean, I've gone years without going to CPK, if that gives you any indication. But we were with friends last night and we went to the Kodak Theater to see Ricky Gervais, so we figured we'd just eat there since it was close to the Theater.  We get there and put our name in. For a party of four, it was a 45 minute wait. It's about 7 so we figured that was an okay wait. Not too bad. We walk around for a bit, show up at 7:20 and they seat us. Good thing we didn't come back after 45 minutes like all those other suckers who were in line. They seriously need to figure out a new time estimation system. I'm not REALLY complaining about there being a shorter wait... okay, I am a little bit. If we weren't totally anal, we wouldn't have been seated. We would've come back around 45 minutes later and STILL have had to wait because EVERYONE else would've come back at the same time. Just seems retarded to me. But you know, whatever. I've never worked in the food industry. Maybe that's just the way they do things. I ask the girl who seated us if CPK had any nutritional information. I just like to know what's in my food. She acted as if I asked her the most inconvenient (and stupidest) question EVER. She said very condescendingly, ""No. We don't have that information."" Dude, I kinda thought that was mandatory. I thought that if you asked a restaurant for nutritional information, they had to have that information available for you. But I guess you don't have to? I don't know. Regardless, I didn't appreciate her attitude. There is a polite way to tell someone something and she... didn't do it. I know that CPK is casual dining and I'm not expecting STELLAR service, but on the other side, I'm not expecting to be treated like total SHIT.  Jessica (from Las Vegas, apparently), our server, is obviously trying to get ""discovered"" and being a waitress isn't her primary goal in life, and that's fine and all, but I don't know... I would think that if I were in Hollywood trying to catch someone's eye, I wouldn't treat my customers like crap because maybe someone you were serving might actually have some connections somewhere. Just because it's not some A-list celeb, it doesn't mean that the person you're serving couldn't help you out in some way. Or at the VERY least, that person could, I don't know... LEAVE YOU A GOOD TIP if you were helpful... I mean, helpful at ALL.  This girl showed up when we first got seated and took our drink order. And didn't take too long getting back. She took our food order. And then didn't come back for FORTY MINUTES. I was the angriest person EVER. She never came back to ask if we needed refills or anything. She was too busy attending a bigger party, in hopes of a good tip, I guess. She came out multiple times to help just about every other table and completely ignored us.  When she finally came back around, I asked her for some silverware and plates and some bread... Which apparently, you need to ask for now? But HOW WAS I TO KNOW THIS? When I asked her why there was no bread (when there was bread on EVERYONE ELSE'S table) she replied VERY rudely to me, ""BECAUSE YOU NEED TO ASK FOR IT NOW."" Oh, really? Wow. Apparently, I didn't get that fucking memo. How the fuck would I know that? Has that been going on for a while? I don't know. And apparently, every single table around us was in the know because they all got bread.  But whatever.  After the large party left, she started being more attentive, but you know, the damage has been done. You treated us like crap, you were rude and unhelpful... why would I want to give you a good tip? I seriously wanted to leave her a DIME for a tip, but the people I was with were nicer. They didn't leave her 20% (which is my customary tip amount... more if they were good, of course) but in my opinion they still gave her too much. Oh, and the food? Still fucking mediocre.  Why do people love it so much? I don't know. I avoid CPKs normally, but I would REALLY suggest avoiding this particular CPK. If you really NEED to eat at the H&H center, I'm sure there are plenty of other eateries that don't have the level of SUCK that this one does. I'd suggest... just about anywhere else. But if for some reason, you just fucking love CPK and you just HAVE to go here, just try to NOT get seated in Jessica's section. You will be able to tell who she is, not only by her handy dandy name tag, but also because she's the one with dull, vacant eyes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hollywood?start=300
