Melissa N.,"Honolulu, HI",326,88,860,5.0,12/14/2017,"It's the holidays and I am already at the mall. I decide to meet my family for dinner here, what's a 15-30 minute wait when I've been shopping for hours prior to finally deciding to grab a bite to eat?!  I check in and was given a buzzer. I was told the wait time for 3 would about a 15-30 minute wait. I asked the hostess about how far will the buzzer work up to and she told me up to Champs. Great to know! I decide to go into Macy's to browse a bit. About 10 minutes later, my family find me there and couple minutes later the buzzer vibrates that our table is ready. I give the hostess my buzzer but in the meantime my family find 3 seats at the bar. Just a tip, id there are open seats at the bar counter, there is no wait time. Ao we decide instead of sitting at a table to eat at the bar counter. The service here is always great! The bartenders are always really super cool and always on their toes! These people hustle! For the sake of me, I forgot our server/bartender's name, but he is part Samoan from what I heard him say. Super friendly guy and great at what he does! First off he takes our drink orders. I order a flight of 3 different red wine. My son orders a cup of milk, and the husband orders an iced tea and 3 waters. Shortly after we get our drinks and then he takes our order. I decided on the Wild Caught Sesame Seared Ahi. Sesame-crusted Ahi tuna steak with seared baby bok choy, over a stir-fry of roasted farro, Shiitake mushrooms and red chili. My son got curly mac and cheese with edamame, my husband got chicken piccata, and we also got spinach artichoke dip with pita bread as a sub to the tortilla chips it normally comes with.  The bartender brings us some house bread with some evoo. Our spinach artichoke dip is then brought out. This is always a good starter. It could actually be a meal. Our food came out pretty quick. After all the bread and some of the artichoke bread on a piece of pita bread, I was getting a full. I ate several bites of my ahi dish and it was good. The ahi was tender and the crust on it was flavorful. I'd eat a little bit of the ahi with a small piece of a baby bok choy and roasted farro. So good! I highly enjoyed my dish! My son always enjoys his curly mac and cheese with edamame. He whacked his pretty quickly. My husband also said his dish was good. Very flavorful and something he tends to order on a regular basis. After we had eaten enough to fill out bellies, we decided on the pound cake dessert with vanilla ice cream. This is always our favorite dessert to share. We moped this as well, best part of the dessert is the bottom side of the cake, it's really buttery. Everything was great including the server/bartender. Always so pleasant and friendly. My family and I will most definitely return.  Just a tip, it's always busy at this location, so be prepared to have to wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2
Heidi Y.,"Honolulu, HI",9,22,5,2.0,11/27/2017,"Two stars for the service, not the food. i love CPK & usually go to the Ala Moana location. Decided to go to Kahala since my boyfriend just finished work there and we were hungry.  Food, tasty as usual.  Service... ehhhhh...? It left my bf and I trippin' After being seated, our server Katarina was very sweet and got our orders in right away. Within minutes, we were served our food and waters! Which was fantastic. Hence, why I gave an extra star. Now, afterwards got a little interesting. I ordered the sangria flight- never came. I understand, being a server myself, that things happen with the bar and that it's the holidays, so it's busy.. So i canceled the order when our server came around 20 minutes later saying that it should be ready then, and i assured her that it was totally fine (which it was. i'm not easily impatient)  Now, we waited. And waited. And waited. 20 minutes. No one checked to see if we were okay, no one checked to see if we needed refills, no one asked if we needed boxes for the food. We didn't even ask for our check, it was just dropped on our table with a ""take your time"" and she (not our server) was gone before i could even ask for a take-out box. The next interaction we got was ""are you done with this?"" in regards to our balsamic on our table and then, without even answering, she (another not our server girl) dipped out with the balsamic before i could (again) ask for a take out box!!  Then we waited ANOTHER 20 minutes until my bf had to wave down a busser to ask if we had to go up to the host stand to pay, which he denied and immediately got someone (thank you, nice busser!!! we appreciated you!) A lady with a light up necklace (manager?) came to take our check and i had to ask for a to-go box before she disappeared! We weren't communicated with at ALL, and we saw tables around us get served, helped and even their checks before us.  Seated around 7:20PM Got food around 7:40PM (+1 star) Finished food at 8:05PM was ignored THE WHOLE TIME except for our server telling us that the wine flight was running late, which was almost 20 minutes later.  Check dropped at 8:25ish. ignored AGAIN for 20 minutes.  finally got take out box, ran our card and left at 8:47, nearly an hour after we had finished eating and no sign of our server anywhere to even ask if we needed dessert or anything.  I refrain from putting poor star reviews on yelp, but i really took this one personally as we looked around and saw that we were the only ones being ignored.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2
L Y.,"Honolulu, HI",0,56,15,1.0,10/29/2017,I agree with all the customers who say that CPK has gotten really expensive!! The quality & quantity has definitely gone down hill. Had the BBQ CHOPPED SALAD & i had to ask for the ranch dressing cause there was NONE!!! I am NOT a RABBIT! Then the Dough Rewards expire within 90 days & even the $10 off of $40 is not worth it!  I had all this & my girlfriend still paid $23 each!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2

Kristine S.,"Honolulu, HI",174,69,66,4.0,10/28/2017,"Updating my review since i've decided to give CPK another chance. And since then, i've tried more of the food.  Located right in Kahala Mall, this is next to Macy's. Calling a takeout order from my experience has been lot easier. The wait time as well wasn't that long. Plus, if i ever have questions, i'll ring up this location and speak to the hostess who is very helpful. Flavors are rich and tasty. I've rethought The Spaghetti tho. That tastes pretty plain imo especially for the price. However that Jambalaya is the bomb and that is my new go to.  I love the Chicken Milanese, The Ribeye steak, Chicken Piccata, and the Cedar Salmon. Now those are so yum. Oh as well as the desserts, and the flatbreads taste good as well. I don't like the famous ""thai crunch"" or the avocado roll.. But like i've said in my last review, to each their own.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2
Cheryl N.,"Honolulu, HI",0,3,1,1.0,1/14/2018,"Take out service is unreliable!  Placed my order at 10:30 in the morning to pick up at 5:15 p.m. Get there to pick it up and they did not even make it yet and it was only a salad!  no pizzas or pastas. The person rings me up and then tells me that they didn't cook the chicken for the salad yet so it will be another 15 minutes. What is the point of having take out where you can place your order ahead if you can't have it ready for pick up! I waited 25 minutes for an order that I placed ahead. No apology offered for the wait either!  Gave this place another chance...Big Mistake!  Went there for take out again and placed a phone order, which they said would be ready in 45 minutes. ordered a salad and a pizza.  Get there at the stated time and there were at least 6 people waiting on the side of the take out counter for there orders. I paid for my order and then ended up waiting another 25 minutes for it. While waiting I over hear other customers complaining about the wait for there orders. When the order is finally ready the guy at the counter gives it to me with no apology or thank you for waiting.  This CPK totally sucks and I definitely won't be going back!  It is poorly managed and the staff at the take out counter have a total lack of customer service skills!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2
Jenna S.,"Honolulu, HI",62,193,536,3.0,10/18/2017,"My visit tonight was awesome! We were seated immediately, nice waitress, and food came out fast and cooked very well. So why 3 stars? I've dined here numerous times and we always get horrible service - this visit so far has been an exception.  Chicken Milanese: one of my favorite all time dishes here! It has three generous portions of flattened chicken breasts fried in panko, covered with arugula and topped with a DELICIOUS checca sauce (tomato, garlic, basil and olive oil). It comes with one lemon to squeeze over the top. Shrimp scampi zucchini fettuccine: I love this dish! It's half zoodles half fettuccine. It's really light and fresh, but you still get your pasta fix. The sauce is super tasty and be sure to get fresh Parmesan grated on top!  Desserts: the salted caramel pudding is to die for! It's a light dessert and the taste is AWESOME! Salty and sweet and just right. I love the chocolate cookie crumbs at the bottom. The portion is just right for one person.  Tonight I tried the chocolate soufflé with ice cream.  The soufflé melted in my mouth! I honesty could have done without the ice cream - the soufflé held its own and the whipped cream would have been just fine. This was a heavier and larger dessert, better for sharing! Overall I like CPK because of their fresh dining options, this location could improve on service - if every night was like tonight I would give 5 stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2
Alyssa K.,"Honolulu, HI",27,18,12,4.0,1/4/2018,My all time go to spot for dinners. Wide selection on the menu. Always consistent. Today was faster service then most visits. Food was on point and the family had a great experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2
Jason C.,"Kaneohe, HI",407,90,44,4.0,9/4/2017,"The CPK brand is a sold choice anywhere you go both for the quality of food and their innovative developments. Portions are hearty and are great for sharing. This particular location is always super busy, so definitely be prepared for a wait for your table during peak hours. I tried a new mushroom pasta today and it was good though I wish they had cooked the garlic a bit more and had cut back on the volume. It left a sharp bite and I know I'm gonna get the garlic stank tomorrow. Service left a little to be desired, but wasn't horrible. Tip for this specific location: definitely connect to their free wifi. No password needed. The cell reception in the mall is terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2
Serena M.,"Honolulu, HI",50,188,873,3.0,9/17/2017,"We went here for take out dinner this past Friday. I was pretty disappointed with the service.  I ordered my meals online and they said that it would be ready in 17 minutes.  When I arrived there, it looked like they weren't very organized.  I already knew that it was gonna be a long wait, because I saw about five people standing around waiting for their food.  This was already a bad sign for me because in my previous visit, I had no problems.  I ordered online, went straight to the counter, paid, and left soon after.  So I thought it would be the same today.  So of course, I just carried my baby instead of taking out the stroller.  Big mistake.  At the take out section, they have a pick up line and an order line.  There was only one lady working both lines.  So when she was done taking someone's order, she would move to the order side to the pick up line.  It really didn't look like they were short staffed because I saw two more people helping her.  But both of those people were getting the orders.  Maybe it would have been more efficient if one of the runners was at the line instead.  I don't know how long I had to wait, but it seemed like forever, since that lady was trying to make sure that the people ahead got their orders, took orders from the new people, and checked on pick up orders.  Also my baby wasn't having it either.  She's such a wiggle worm so when we had to stand in line for that long, she was getting antsy.  She was trying to climb all over me and she even tried to grab the lady's hair in front of us.  Finally it was our turn and I had no intention of giving this lady a hard time.  She really was trying her best and no one was really helping her.  Then I hear one of the runners scolding her because she's not saying the name on the order so they can get it from the back.  I just wanted to roll my eyes.  Poor girl.  It's like that game Diner Dash, where you quickly have to service people or they will start getting mad and leaving.   Both my husband and I ordered pastas.  He ordered the Jambalaya pasta and I ordered the garlic cream fettucine.  He liked his and he said that it was the right amount of hotness.  I thought mine was okay.  I probably could have made better.  The noodles were a little overcooked and were all stuck to each other.  Also for my pasta, it doesn't come with any kind of topping, so I ordered shrimp with mine.  Just adding the shrimp costs $5.00 extra.  I think I had a total of 5 shrimp, $1 a shrimo.   I'm not sure what the big hype is about CPK.  I always see people just standing outside of the restaurant waiting for a table.  I thought their take out would be a good option for us since we never go out anymore.  But it really wasn't worth it.  We go to a closer restaurant and CPK really can't beat them.  You don't need to even get out of your car for their take out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2
Zoe T.,"Honolulu, HI",174,149,859,5.0,9/24/2017,"What a fresh relief, we had excellent service today by our waitress, Grace. She was so friendly, bubbly, great personality and gave us an awesome service.  The food was good, they don't offer too many vegetarian dishes but we tried our best.  We started off with the buffalo cauliflower (ask for the cheese and cream sauce on the side). I really like this dish.  Next we had the wild mushroom strozzapreti. A little oily but tasted good...since I love mushrooms. This is the dish for mushroom lovers. Lastly we had the California Veggie pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2
Jeffrey A.,"Honolulu, HI",260,78,112,3.0,7/24/2017,"After a relaxing day at the beach, the bf and I decided to go to CPK Kahala because he wanted to drink a sangria. I love CPK and their service normally is amazing.  But this time, it was okay.  We got buzzed after 20 minutes and was able to get seated.  The waitress, which I won't say her name because she seemed like she was covering a lot of tables, took our drink order and then said she was going to be back with bread.  We decided to share a kung pao spaghetti and thai crunch salad.  My bf ordered a sangria flight and that took about 15 minutes to get.  Afterwards, we got our bread.   Just to get our order in took about maybe 15-20 minutes and another 15-20 for our food.  The thai crunch salad was okay.  I wish it had more lettuce.  I don't remember it being made with minimal lettuce and a lot of the crunchy white chips & peanuts.  It was alright.  The kung pao was pretty good, but a little salty for my taste.  I enjoyed it regardless because I was hungry. Not too sure what was going on that night.  The quality of the service and the food was very mediocre.  I'm assuming that they were busy, but that's okay.  That won't stop me from going to CPK again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2
Kaikeali'i C.,"Honolulu, HI",46,64,296,5.0,7/28/2017,"I'm normally never in the mood to eat at this place just because, but decided to eat here July 27, 2017 around 8:15pm-ish. It was a lot of big parties waiting to be seated and it was just the two of us, thinking it might be a long wait but didn't mind I was at Verizon while we were waiting, but shockingly it was less than 10 mins.  CPK's menu has A LOT going on...you sometimes need more than 5 mins because of all the info on the menu. I'm an appetizer kinda guy then picking one meal because I like options/variety when I eat.  BRAH!!!! Sangria flights were HELLA BOMB!!! The bartender that night was lit! Everything was very well balance, not too sweet, not too strong but right in the middle! My girlfriend was feeling it and that's rare off of sangria.Good job who ever was the bartender that night!!! It was so good I ordered the red berry sangria by itself which will be in the photos soon.  G-R-A-C-E!!!! Grace, I want to say that you were the highlight of our entire day. Your personality is INCREDIBLE!!! My girlfriend doesn't approve of a lot of servers because they always lack customer service and both of us work in an industry where customer service is key to any establishment and servers and anyone else who works in the customer industry always represents the company they work for and you represented CPK Kahala very well. Continue what you're doing and no matter how your day goes girl, fake it till you make it haha as we say in the industry.  No, the customer is not always right!!! Haha sorry but I had to say that because I can't say that where I work.  Again, I'm not a CPK food kinda person but the experience I had with Grace put us in a great mood and the Sangrias added to the experience haha. I would go back knowing I would be treated with such awesomeness haha I order whatever haha.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2
Marc Y.,"Honolulu, HI",47,71,171,4.0,7/13/2017,"California Pizza Kitchen always hits the spot.  It doesn't matter who I'm with, if a restaurant can't be decided on, CPK is always a sure bet, and fail-proof solution. The Kahala Mall location is typically busy throughout the day, which is what makes this location the tops in the nation.  You are given a buzzer to be notified when your table is ready.  Not only is this location their busiest, they have the best staff in Hawaii.  Not once have I had a bad experience.  Time for the food... Every successful meal at CPK begins with the Spinach Artichoke Dip (served with chips).  This dip is their signature appetizer, and definitely starts your meal off right.  Whether with my boyfriend, family or friends, we typically order a salad and a pizza to share.  For salads, I recommend the Waldorf Chicken or Thai Crunch salad.  For pizzas, the Jamaican Jerk Chicken is bomb -- my absolute favorite.  For a lighter option, the White Pizza is good.  As a tip, if getting this pizza, ask for Truffle Oil on the side.  Your taste buds will be excited. California Pizza Kitchen revamps their menus for the season providing different options from the norm, while keeping their base menu the same.  Dine here and your stomach will leave happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2
Chelsea S.,"Honolulu, HI",10,42,237,3.0,10/19/2017,"If you're ever planning to go to Kahala Mall, CPK could be a very satisfying choice for lunch or dinner! Note the word ""planning"" because this place can get very busy. Always arrive or check-in 30 minutes or more before your desired dining time as there is almost always a waiting time. Don't fret though because you can kill your time walking around the mall! (Hint: You can sit at the bar and not have to wait!) Every time I go to CPK, I'm always pretty satisfied. The taste of the food is good. Never can go wrong with the Thai Crunch Salad, BBQ Chicken Pizza, or Chicken Picatta (my favorite). I've also ordered/tasted the Santa Fe Bowl, Chicken Tequila Fettuccine, The Original BBQ Chicken Sandwich, and Grilled Veggie Sandwich. Sante Fe Bowl: A very healthy choice but nothing special and flavor was kind of bland. Chicken Tequila Fettuccine: Quite delicious and has an interesting flavor. It's creamy but does not have a distinct flavor. The noodles were also very thick and too al dente for me. Original BBQ Chicken Sandwich: Very tasty sandwich! Highly recommend with Baked Potato Soup. However, I had this with a yummy, cheesy bread on my first try and after that, they used regular bread. Not sure if the chef was different but if you can, try to request this cheesy, herby bread. Grilled Veggie Sandwich: Another healthy choice but it's kind of sad and the veggies are bland. Doesn't fill you up nor satisfies. Also I tried the Sicilian Pizza with thin crust. It's pretty tasty but not sure if the combination of the meats makes this one of the saltier pizzas... The least favorable thing about this place is your bill can get pretty high because the prices aren't very cheap. My suggestion: split dishes among your party as much as you can. Their portions are enough to split but not enough to leave you stuffed. Service is usually good. They can get busy so don't be surprised if you aren't visited too often or receive a lot of attention. The waiters/waitresses are friendly but honestly, you're just another dollar-sign to most of them... Nevertheless, CPK is a great family spot and casual lunch/dinner restaurant! It's a place you should visit every once in a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2
Warren N.,"Honolulu, HI",108,102,109,4.0,10/9/2017,"A long 3-day weekend deserves CPK! The Kahala location always seems slammed and Friday night was no exception. The wait was about 20 minutes for the two of us...not bad. They've added some new items to their menu so I had to try the piadina and soup combo. It comes in ancho chile short rib or smashed chicken meatball. I opted for the short rib and wasn't disappointed. The piadina is served with your choice of soup, which makes this quite a deal for $13.45. Yes it's a small cup of soup but it's plenty enough to balance the piadina. Piadinas are like an unsealed calzones I guess. This one was packed with lots of flavor from slow-cooked short ribs and a medium spicy ancho chile sauce. Arugula is also included to add a touch of green. My opinion: totally could do without the arugula and totally could do with more cheese. I chose the creamy baked potato soup to accompany my piadina. Good choice: creamy soup to temper the fire of the ancho chile.  I've had piadina sandwiches (see my review of Piadina in Tustin CA) and the CPK version is not quite as good as Piadina's, but It comes close. Coupled with the soup it makes a filling meal.  As always, we really only came to CPK for the butter cake sans $1.75 scoop of Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream. Lol. As is sometimes the case the server forgot and added the ice cream anyway. Then we got told: ""Sorry, we added the ice cream on top by mistake. Do you want it anyway or should we remake it? We won't charge you for our mistake. I hope you aren't lactose intolerant...""  Lol...it's BUTTER cake.  Kudos to the staff for being considerate. Also, our server Joanna was excellent!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2

The place was basically empty. The waiters were talking to each other at the monitor.  First, we were trying to be patient. I was a server before and I totally get that it can be overwhelming...but it was after lunch rush and before dinner at like 4pm. But, the waitress asked a table right next to us if they wanted dessert - then walked PASSED us to the other table next to us and proceeded to clean it.  We watched them seat other people after us and they got their food before we anyone even asked us what we wanted. Servers even gave us eye contact but didn't bother to approach us.

Before 10AM. Long line, long wait. I show up at CPK at opening time to have a drink and wait it out. CPK Manager stands at the entrance, sees me, ignores me and continues to chat with underlings. Finally... she decides to acknowledge me and asks point blank ""So... Yes????? Apparently, she's not at work, she's happily talking story with peeps at 10:30 because that's What You Do. I'm finally sitting at the bar now drinking the lovely sangria that they make. The menus for food and drinks are awesome.

Lureen K.,"Honolulu, HI",0,2,,1.0,10/9/2017,"CPK Kahala, I am very disappointed with the current quality of your food. I used to enjoy dining here, both in-restaurant or takeout. However the prices have been going up while the quality has definitely gone down. Tonight we phone ordered ahead, waited about 20min at home before driving the 10min to the mall. Order was ready so that was good. Got home, took out my ""full-sized"" Waldorf salad and not only was there no dressing included but the salad was so small it barely filled one side of the takeout container! I think I could grab up the entire salad in one hand, including the 5 mini pieces of chicken, and I'm a really small person! For $16.49?!! No way! Pizzas were already cooled before even leaving the mall and are now so small my 11 yr old daughter finished the entire thing in one sitting. Add to that rude staff (what happened to the good pleasant wait staff that used to work there?!!) and I think I'll be spending my money elsewhere. Update: The hubby drove back to Kahala Mall to return the salad which I didn't want anymore and to show them what we were talking about (we called ahead of time to complain). He was refunded the cost and given a ""new"" salad free of charge with the explanation of ""We're sorry, sir. This has never happened before!"" Yeah, right. But I have to give them props for trying to remedy the situation. I just hope none of the staff spat in my salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=20

Anuhea P.,"Honolulu, HI",423,234,629,2.0,3/22/2017,"I will never order cpk takeout again. I had the worst experience here last month. I called for a takeout order, pizza and salad on a weeknight. I was going to drive over to kaneohe with food for my Mom who is undergoing chemo. They quoted me 30- 40 min. I parked in the pick up spot, near cpk ( I think there's a 15 min limit), with about 5 min left to wait (according to their quoted time) and proceeded to pay for my order. ""Almost ready, give us a few more minutes"" they told me.  As I waited, more and more people started showing up for take out orders, it seemed like a crowd was waiting. I got a bit nervous about my parking space, so after waiting +15 minutes,  i asked them how much longer. "" were just waiting on the salad, your pizza is here in the warmer"". Now I used to work takeout at an Italian restaurant and salads are the quickest things to make because it doesn't take time to cook anything, you just assemble.  People around me were starting to get angry, an uncle who had been waiting started yelling at the to go people, which made me feel bad. It seemed like the restaurant wasn't too busy, so what was the trouble? Finally after an hour and fifteen minutes past the time I put in the order, I received my full order with a ""sorry"". Now I'm not one to fish for free things but they should have comped something, thrown in a dessert, or taken a percentage off; that's what our manager would have had us do where I worked. It would have been faster for me to dine in!  Luckily I wasn't towed, but being pregnant, I was ravenous. The second I sat down in the car, I tore into the pizza. It was cold. Of course it was after sitting for 30+ minutes. The crust had gotten stale and it was hard to bite through. I didn't have time to bring it back and ask for another, my mom was already wondering where I was. I sucked it up, and raced over the pali, learning my lesson never to do takeout (and maybe dine in) at Kahala again. ****edit**** The management reached out a couple months after this incident to try and make up for the lack of service. And though I appreciate the gesture, I will not take down or change my review until I encounter different service here. For the effort to follow up on my experience, I have added one star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=20

No, this review is about the service we had from Jenn.   She was attentive, full of energy, got the food to us fast, and overall a very good server.   She had quite a few tables to handle and while we watched her move from table to table, not once did we get the impression that she was stressed out.  Whenever we spoke to her to ask her for something, she was more than happy to get it for us.   Glass empty, she was there to refill it.  Needed boxes to box up, she was back real quick.  And get this, we gave her our pizza dough card number and said to use the $5 dough rewards and when we got the check, there was the credit.  Now how many of you can attest to the fact that more often than not, your server forgets to apply the credit??  Show of hands people.

Brenden H.,"Honolulu, HI",72,52,18,5.0,12/29/2017,"After eating here at this location maybe 15 times, we had dinner here again last night.  I thought I'd write a quick review, in part because I've seen a bunch of negative reviews for reasons that have nothing to do with food or service quality, and claims that CPK has gotten ""too expensive"". It's not cheap.  But if you want and expect cheap food, this is not where you should be eating.  Price should be compared in the context of the level and style of the food, otherwise it's nonsense. I love places like 12th Ave, but, CPK can match quality, is more consistent, and is about 1/2 the price. We mostly rotate eating out among places like 12th Ave, Town, Sabrina's, Pig and Lady, Maguro Ya, etc., we feel it's important to support locally owned non-franchise places, and yet CPK Kahala holds it's own among these and other excellent restaurants in Honolulu. We can't resist now and then, this somewhat guilty pleasure. What stands out is consistency in food quality and service:  just outstanding. Creativity and variety of the menu is really good, service is excellent in our experience.  Venture out and try some of the main courses other than the pizza!  (which is really good as well) To sit at the counter on a slammingly busy night during the holiday season is an impressive experience, what you'll see is a cheerful, friendly and efficient staff that works as a team, truly a well oiled machine.  Impressive training is partly responsible, but I am just so impressed with this place, I think this is one of the best food values for mid-upper level dinner in Honolulu.

Let me share. On 20- May 2017, we paid a visit to Kahala Mall. After conducting our business, we went in search of food. My wife suggested CPK, even though it was on the other side of the mall from where we had conducted our other business.  OK... Walk a little, browse a lot... Got to CPK. They were busy, but not fully packed. I walk with the aid of a walking stick due to a bad L4-L5 disc that without meds would have me laid out on a bed.  We ask for a table for two, and there is clearly no way for the seating hostess to NOT notice 55"" tall walking stick, wrapped with bright orange Paracord on the upper end.  She claims she has no open tables to seat us but we can wait about 10 minutes, or seat at the bar. I told her we would have a drink while we wait for a table.  We walk to the bar. Bartender serves us right away. Great guy. Great drinks.  Directly across from us in the dining room is an open table; I point it out to my wife. Not two minutes after this, the same seating hostess sits a woman and two girls at this table.    A couple on the table next to that gets up and leaves, the table is quickly cleared and another couple that has walked up has been seated.  This proceeds to happen three more times and the same seating hostess walks by us each time like we are chopped liver. The waiter slides us menus. I tell him thank you for the drinks they were great. Cleared my tab and my wife said let's go, I've never felt so disrespected in my life! Never again at KAHALA CPK. Now, I'm not going to say this was racially motivated, but I can tell you for sure that all the people that got seated before us were one, and my wife and I were not.

You can add chicken or Salmon. I would definitely choose the salmon. The chicken seemed so small and a bit dry, but the salmon never disappoints. My dad got the Margherita pizza which looked amazing! Too bad i'm not eating carbs right now.  Also, their mac and cheese (add bacon) is a must have when I go with my friends. It's delicious!

The ingredients looked great and was excited, as I watched her make the drink everything seemed lovely until she dipped her mixer into the sanitizer sink and mixed the sanitizer with the rest of my drink. I didn't say anything at first hoping she would realize there was foam on my glass and top of my drink but unfortunately she never asked why i didn't drink it through time I was there. I drank my water instead and ordered the chicken Milanese. That I would give a 5 star to and a salute to the cooks and chefs who put that together. Looked wonderful and was very pleasant to eat. Yet again Ashley the bartender gave an unpleasant attitude which made sitting at the bar very awkward and uncomfortable. She started closing down the bar, throwing materials into the sink. And never once asking about my food or drink. Never again will I want to sit at the bar when she works there. Finally she drops the check and didn't bother taking the drink off even though it was right in front of her untouched throughout the entire night. Now it started to just get stressful.

I thought I had dodged it while in there but it stuck to the bottom of my shoes and made a sickening suction noise as I walked backed to my table. I asked my wife how the woman's restroom was and she said it had not been deep cleaned for a long time. I hope the main manager of the restaurant reads this and takes action on cleaning the bathrooms and responds to this post.  We keep telling ourselves never to go back to a CPK again but this time we really aren't going to go to one again. One dish was good (we shared that) but  the other one was a cream pasta dish with no cream. When they tried to fix it it came out COLD (pasta not reheated) and looked like the cook put in a crazy amount of cold garlic cream sauce l, it was worse off now  and I politely declined to pay for it when the check came. We both couldn't eat it, had one bite and both felt sick when we left. Gave a generous tip for the waiter for trying to help us but sometimes you wonder about the wisdom of sending the dish back to the kitchen to be corrected. Having extensive experience in working at restaurants my wife knows a lot about the staffs back room chatter concerning customers that are not pleased with their meal.  I guess if you really like CPK and stick to dishes that you know will be consistent then that's your choice. We remember when CPK first came to Hawaii and it has really gone down hill. The Kailua location dishes taste like they move food from somewhere else and then reheat it.  Still waiting for the manager to post a response about the absolutely disgusting amount of urine on the men's bathroom floor.

They are tired at 9pm and don't want to wait on any more tables. We came here at 9pm on a Friday and were quoted a 45 minute wait. Many tables were leaving but no one took any time to clear any of the vacated tables. Finally after the 45 minute wait, we were seated in the now empty restaurant and no one came to wait on our table or even came to say hello. We sat with menus and no water for over 10 minutes without a greeting for a staff member. Simply unacceptable! We were trying to celebrate my brother in laws birthday.

However, I always received top notch service and the staff were always on it. Low and behold when I decide to eat here on a Monday night at 5:00 I receive the worst experience ever. First of all we got our buzzer and they said it would be 20-30 minutes. That's fine because it was the normal wait time at restaurants. However, more than half of the restaurant was empty!!! When asked why they said they didn't have enough staff to fill their restaurant. Ok then! Finally our buzzer rang and they said that they could fit 5 of us into a mini booth. Mini!!! Like meant to sit 1 person on each side! We said that we would like a regular size one and the short lady at the sign in was like ""well you're just gonna have to wait then!"" So rude!!! Furthermore the party she sat before us with only 2 people ended up in a regular size booth!!! How does that make any sense at all? They could've seated them in the mini booth and we could've got the regular sized booth! So we had to wait another 10-20 minutes for a regular sized booth! Finally we got seated with no utensils or anything. Just our menus. Our waiter was very nice but never around. He took our order, brought our food, and pretty much never came back till we flagged him down for our check!! We did not receive any water refills and had to ask random servers passing if we could have utensils. The food was good, but my California club pizza was cut horribly! The pieces were all different sizes. I had mini pieces and then super large ones! On top of that they didn't cut through the crust. And we ordered a salad, but somehow that was the last thing to come out! You don't need to cook a salad!!! Anyways it was just a really bad experience. Definitely not coming back here unless I really have to! Their service has plummeted and I'm not sure why! Maybe new staff or management?

Your hostess was so rude to the people ahead of me waiting in line  that I had to post this.  It was probably due to it being Halloween night and it was very busy.

Shandis C.,"Honolulu, HI",285,373,2038,4.0,4/4/2016,"The food at CPK is standard franchise food, in my opening. It's nothing spectacular but you can always count on having a pretty good salad, pizza or pasta. And while I'm Never totally thrilled to eat at CPK, we still come here quite often because there are a few things that really do stand out: 1) Service. The service at this particular location is amazing. Friendly, accommodating and super ""local"" make-you -feel-like-you're-family friendly. 2) Kid friendly. They know how to handle kids here! On our last visit 8 kids ages between 3 and 9 took up more than half our table AND they all sat on one side of the table while us 5 adults sat on the the other end. People were staring at us as they walked by as I'm sure it looked like a potential hurricane situation. But our server handled everyone FLAWLESSLY! She managed to get all our kids orders, get all their drinks, dishes, and and plates upon plates of bread to them with perfection and our kids were all happy campers and I'm happy to announce that no hurricanes, ruckuses, fires or meltdowns occurred! The kids were happy so the adults were happy and I commend our server for doing such an excellent job!  3) Birthday parties. They do great birthday parties here for only $10 per kid which includes a make your own pizza, a drink, ice cream sundae, a tour of the kitchen, a coupon for a FREE kids meal for each kid to take home, and a real kid size chef jacket for the birthday child. Can't beat this deal! And the kids love it. We have gone to so many Bday parties here and I have collected those free kids meals coupons at each party that I can't remember the last time we've paid for our kids meals here.  4) Pizza ""dough"" rewards. For every $100 you spend here, you get $5 reward bucks. Those rewards rack up quickly and we always have some kind of discount deal or rewards to use while dining here.  The one thing that can be a bummer is that the wait can be long most times. But the kids like to look at the near by shops and the time goes by quicker than you might think. If you don't want to wait, just order take out online and pick your food up to go. Super simple and quick.  I guess there's a reason that this is the highest grossing CPK in the US. Overall, I'm happy to have this convenient, consistent and child friendly restaurant in the neighborhood.

Our drinks on the other hand were just a tad bit too sweet for our tastes. My Moscow mule was good at first then got way too sweet for me at halfway through. My friends mojito was boring and sweet. I think if they had had more flavors she'd be more into it. But I mean other than that the meal was great. The service on the other hand... yikes.

Layton L.,"Honolulu, HI",0,5,15,5.0,1/12/2017,"This is my #1 spot for a great family dinner. After the many times my mom would take us out for dinner. I decided to be the one doing that; to take my family here for dinner today! I've been to CPK a lot of times, so I familiarized myself with the staff, the food, and even the manager, LOL (Yes, the manager actually walks around the restaurant and converses with customers!). I didn't actually plan to come here, since you can call in for reservations, but after mentioning about going out for dinner, my brother got excited since he LOVES this place. My other brother and mom were okay with going out today, so we did. After checking in for a table, they said it would be a 10 minute wait. They give you a device that vibrates once your table is ready, so you don't have to worry about losing track of time. Go and explore the mall! There's Macy's just right by CPK. Once our table was ready, we were led by our server, Jessica, to our table and we requested for water. Once the water came out, we were ready to order... our appetizers! My crazy brother LOVES their Crispy Mac n' Cheese. He always takes 2 plates of it. We ordered 2 plates of that and also 1 of their Avocado Club Egg Rolls. Seriously, if you're a fan of avocado and a fan of egg rolls, then you NEED to try it. It blows my mind. Each plate comes with 6 rolls and 2 types of sauce (I forgot what it was, but I'll put a picture of the food for you to guess.) We devoured our appetizers and ordered our main courses. My crazy brother got their Pepperoni Pizza since he likes pepperoni pizza, LOL. My other brother got a Fire-Grilled Ribeye (medium rare), my mom got a half Original BBQ Chicken salad, and I got the Italian Chopped half salad. The food came out pretty fast, about 10-15 minutes I would say. They handed me my salad, then my mom's, then the ribeye, and then the pizza. Perfect! Time to dig in! That first of the salad, MAN that was delicious! I really loved the beans in the salad, it give it such a great, satisfying flavor! My mom enjoyed their BBQ Chicken and their avocados (Yes, she added avocados into her salad.). My brother shared a slice of his 12oz ribeye with me and, wow. That is one good steak! There was a lot of flavor and I could really tell they cooked under fire! My crazy brother devoured his pizza, like always. After we were done, we were told if we wanted dessert. Most of the time we did, but we decided not to. We were totally full at the moment... If you do get dessert here, GET THIER BUTTER CAKE WITH ICE CREAM: You won't regret it. :) In total, this dinner was about $73. In my opinion, it's a pricy joint if you were to eat more.

Fran C.,"Honolulu, HI",460,954,11214,4.0,2/24/2016,"Yo! Dijah see the latest on this place???? It's been awhile since I've eaten at the Kahala Mall CPK, and I was surprised when I saw that they extended the outdoor mall seating further out into the walk way area of the mall. So smart of them to enlarge the restaurant, because this restaurant really has a very strong following, and they really crank over here! Last night I was jonesing for some lettuce wraps, so I called the gf to see if she wanted to go to CPK to eat. Lucky for me, she is always down, so off we went to Kahala Mall. Upon arriving at the restaurant, the place was packed! We walked up to the hostess & asked her if we could get a table. Lucky for us, we were able to secure a table for two.........but the only catch for this table was that it was under an A/C vent, so she told us it could get rather cold. For me, I hate the cold........but the gf likes the cold, so we took the table. I guess no can complain if you don't have to wait to eat yeah? Upon getting seated, the waiter came by & dropped off menus and water. Upon scanning the menu, we ordered the following grindz last night - 1 For Appetizers - Shrimp Lettuce Wraps ($12.49) 2. Thai Crunch Salad - half order ($11.59) 3. Cedar Plank Salmon ($19.99) 4. Ice Tea ($2.99) What can I say about the grindages? I love the lettuce wraps! CPK offers the lettuce wraps in 1. Chicken 2. Shrimp 3. Chicken & Shrimp Since the gf doesn't do chicken, we just got the plain shrimp, and I must say.........whatever you decide, you cannot go wrong! The lettuce wraps come with Shiitake mushrooms, water chestnuts, & scallions tossed in a spicy ginger soy sauce. For my entree, I got the Thai Crunch Salad (1/2 order)..........it is a crunchy salad and cilantro with chicken and the crunch of peanuts, wontons and rice sticks. Tossed with a Thai Peanut dressing. The gf got the Cedar Plank Salmon...........the salmon is roasted on a cedar plank with smoked paprika and lime. The dish is served with white corn and spinach succotash topped with feta. What can I say about my meal? I loved the lettuce wraps and could have eaten the whole thing for my dinner........Lol! As for my Thai Crunch Salad, it was just okay for me........I guess I wasn't a big fan of the dressing, but it's always good to try something new. The gf seemed to like her meal, but I did not sample any of hers even after she offered it to me. Overall, a pretty good dining experience at CPK............great service, and delicious food...........and by the time we were done with our meal..........after sitting under the A/C vent, I swear I was frozen & cold!!!  I guess it was good for me to sit at this table, as I have to go to the mainland soon, so I mine as well get some early prep.for some really cold weather.

This is the highest grossing location in the nation and I don't wonder why.  In the wake of a reimagined menu rolled out just a few days ago, I tried their new Farmers Market soup. This was an incredibly hearty, thick and savory roasted squash soup with a medley of market vegetables such as corn and zucchini, with a touch of cream and a drizzle of olive oil. Add some ground black pepper you will absolutely love this satisfying soup. A hearty cup is 4.99 but a bowl which is more than twice the size of the cup is 6.99. The soup was divine to the last drop, and just as I was recovering from my Farmers Market soup withdrawal, the Morrocan spiced chicken salad arrived. The dish is a truly delightful and uncommon salad made with roasted butternut squash (can you tell I love butternut squash?), avocado, dates, cranberries, beets, red peppers and chopped egg tossed in a yummy housemade champagne vinaigrette dressing which is actually best on the side. The full sized portion is pricey, however, at 17.29. I'm glad I stopped by while I was in the area to try some of their new items.

Jeff K.,"Honolulu, HI",1,7,2,5.0,8/13/2017,"CPK All the Way- Simply Amazing... California Pizza Kitchen at Kahala Mall is a Hawaii  eatery whose service staff and management compliment the great food served there. Our family of 8, eats here often, and it is no easy task to always please us, when you consider we order a diverse sampling of their Pizzas, Pastas, delicious Entrees, and Desserts. Their popular Spinach/Artichoke dip with Taro Tortilla chips appetizer, their savory Chicken, Fish, or Shrimp Pasta dishes, and my favorite, their fire grilled, tasty Rib-Eye steak.Yes, there is a lot to like at CPK Kahala. Their desserts are always a great way to end your meal with our Fav chocolate soufflé alamode or, their moist Butter cake with strawberries, But, the best thing I appreciate about CPK Kahala is their consistent and helpful staff. Overall, the whole CPK service staff is to be commended. But, there is one table server who always goes out of her way, above and beyond, to help, and her name is ""Grace"". it is apparent that she is happy to be there as a CPK employee and most importantly insuring that while YOU are dining there, your table will be well taken care of. Ask for Grace's table when you make your next dinner reservations, you'll see what I mean.  I also have to mention helpful CPK Restaurant Manager, ""Dan"" who runs a tight ship checking with all of the dining patrons as to their total satisfaction for the night. I am one who notices these extra efforts being made, enjoying the quality food, and the staff seeing to your every dining needs, brings customers like me, back again and again.

I really enjoy going to this location (I've been to Kahala, Pearlridge and The Ala Moana locations) and I'd have to say that the Kahala location is my favorite!! First of all it brings back so many good memories of my High School days, which feels like a million years ago. It's got a great spot at the mall and I never have a problem finding parking. The staff is always friendly even when it's super busy and the food is ALWAYS delicious!!  My only complaint is that I don't really understand how the CPK dough rewards works and the servers rarely ask me if I have a rewards card and I'm usually so full that I forget, just a suggestion to the staff... Ask your customers if they have a reward card or if they'd like to sign up for one.  I do have to admit that I was a little disappointed with my dessert the last time that I went to Kahala CPK, I had the chocolate cake with ice cream and the cake was really dry luckily my daughter didn't mind and she polished off the cake and I happily ate the ice cream. I really want to try the butter cake the next time and I hope that it's not dry. I'll have to go there just for dessert because I'm usually way too full to have dessert.

Michele A.,"Honolulu, HI",3,12,44,1.0,8/3/2017,"Usually, my experience here is really good, but this time it wasn't.  I usually order the pesto with spaghetti NOT with penne, add shrimp, mushrooms and fresh tomatoes, skip the sun dried tomatoes.  Plus, I ask for extra sauce, because sometimes as it sits waiting to be served, the sauce gets absorbed by the pasta.  Got my dinner and the sauce was not thick like it usually is, but watery!  Kind of gross!  All I could taste was the pasta noodles and nothing else.  Told the manager about what was wrong with my dish.  He said that he would get it remedied in 10 minutes.  Took it to the kitchen and I waited...waited...waited.  My husband finished his dinner and all I ate was their house bread, which tasted rather stale.  Waiter said that they had some being baked.  No way, it was cold and stale!  Raspberry iced tea I ordered didn't have enough syrup.  After a while, it started to taste like regular iced tea.  Anyway, still waiting for my dinner.  The waiter asked me why the manager took my meal away.  I told him the problem.  He told me that he noticed it was watery when he brought it to me.  Why didn't he remedy this problem before hand???  His excuse was that they were making changes in the kitchen staff.  He asked me if I wanted to take it to go and I looked at him confused.  At the time, I was still hungry.  I told him that I wished to eat it here.  Still no dinner and I was getting full off of stale bread.  Fifteen minutes went by and the manager was coming back with my dinner.  He brought me pesto WITH penne and NOT spaghetti.  I looked at him with disgust and wasn't very pleased.  Why would you bring me something that I didn't order in the first place?  Why didn't you check the meal before you brought it to me?  I asked him to package it up and that we were leaving.  Fortunately, I wasn't charged for the meal.  Like I said before, my past experience with this CPK is usually good, but this time, it seemed that they were just hurrying you up so that they could turn another table.  To me, the manager needs to learn a little more tact in customer service and be more concerned when a customer is not satisfied, instead of be standoffish and uncaring.  Try not to be the automated robot that has to ask the obligatory question of...""how is everything tasting or how is everything""?  I felt very unsatisfied!  They may have lost a loyal customer!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=100

Travis H.,"Sarasota, FL",50,114,355,4.0,7/8/2015,"Let me start off by saying that this location is by far the best of the ""big 3"" (Ala Moana, Waikiki, and Kahala). I've tried Waikiki on three separate occasions since it's a bit more convenient, but it's been just awful on all three attempts. Ala Moana isn't bad, but the wait to be seated is often 45mins minimum. That's not their fault, but to eat the same thing, I'd prefer the 5-10 minute wait time at Kahala.  Enough negatives! On to the review. This is a go to spot for my wife and I. You'll be seated rather quickly more often than not. The food has always been fantastic. Out of the multiple times (we come here a lot) we've been here, our food has never been brought to us incorrectly. Not one mistake, ever. That's pretty darn consistent. The most recent trip here was on July 4th as we decided to pass on the madness of the Waikiki fireworks for a quiet dinner instead. I ordered the original BBQ chicken pizza with bacon, and my wife ordered her favorite, the five cheese with fresh tomato (add chicken of course). Both pizzas were delicious (see pictures below), and of course they were prepared properly.  The only issue I have is that the staff is hit or miss. Some of the waiters/waitresses are incredible, but other times you'll be met with someone who is clearly overwhelmed and/or not wanting to be there. That's such a disappointment when you're having dinner and the waiter is disinterested in helping you. All things considered, it's one of the better CPK's around. It's worth the extra few miles to drive, trust me!  PS: Sign up for their pizza dough rewards program. It's free and you immediately get a free small plate for signing up!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=100
Jill P.,"Aiea, HI",89,125,77,4.0,8/12/2016,"So lt me start by saying that I love CPK.  I have eaten at the one in Kailua, Pearl Ridge and Kahala several times.  I have never had a bad experience.  Until last night.  I ordered the Waldorf Chicken salad and it looked amazing.  About 10 bites in, I find this mysterious piece of plastic.  What was it?  At first I was going to blow it off (for a split second), but the more I thought about it, the more it bothered me.  Was it a piece of food handler's glove?  Was it part of a wrapper?  Was it something that totally didn't belong there and what did it touch before it was included in my salad?  So when the manager came around to ask how my food was, I was honest.  I showed him the plastic and he immediately apologized and asked if I wanted another salad.  I accepted and it was brought out within minutes.  When I received my bill, I was totally comp'ed for it.  The salad was delicious, but I could't totally get past the mystery plastic to enjoy it to the fullest. I thought it was strange when he asked me if I wanted him to box up the 'defected' salad when he brought out the new one.  Probably a standard reflex, but there was no way I wanted that.   It won't ruin me for CPK...I'll still go back.  I just subtracted one star for the experience...otherwise, all of these locations on Oahu are great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=100

California Pizza Kitchen is located in Kahala Mall, closer to Macy's Men Store.  There is ample parking all around the mall.  The restaurant has a section that is seated into the mall area, a larger section that includes the bar area and a view of the parking lot, and a smaller back area.  Each section has a combination of booths and tables. We were here for dinner on a Monday night.  It was about 5:30 pm and we had a short 10 minute wait for a table.  We were seated in the newer section in the back.  I believe that it used to be Yummy's.  The lighting in the area is very dark.  It may be good for like really romantic dates, but for family dinner, it was wrong.  The kids needed to break out the flashlight app on their phones so I could see the menu.  The track lightning isn't even aimed at the tables.  Add to that, my chair was off balance.  Our waited switched out my chair, but noting could be done about the lighting.  Whatever!  I was hungry! Our waiter seemed distracted, but he was genuinely nice.  He listened when the youngest ordered and didn't judge her on her order (she likes things on the side).  Hubby ordered chicken & shrimp lettuce wraps (to share) and a BBQ pizza (for himself).  Middle child was sad because they took the chicken caesar sandwich off the menu.  She opted for the Mac'n Cheese Bites and a chicken caesar salad.  I wanted to try something new and went for Thai pizza.  We asked for our free bread and settled in for good conversation while we waited for our food. Our lettuce wraps came out first.  With 4 of us, we quickly went thru the lettuce.  Our waiter had to grab us more.  The wait was a little long for the lettuce, over 5 minutes.  Not sure if he forgot or of the kitchen was backed up.  The kids pizza came out next.  It must've been excellent because that was gone before the rest of us got our food.  My Thai pizza was very good!  The bran sprouts, peanut sauce, carrots, and cilantro made a task pizza!  The BBQ pizza is always excellent!  The caesar salad was tasty and had a lot of cheese!   We didn't really stay for dessert because the lightning was giving me a low grade headache.  I bribed the family with dessert in the mall. The price for our food, the quality, and the service made this a fun night for us to just hang out.  Maybe next time, I'll just ask to be seated not in the back?  Or go during the day when there is more sun?   (4)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=100

Chels C.,"Honolulu, HI",6,26,2,5.0,6/8/2015,"I've never enjoyed sitting at the bar until I went to CPK Kahala. FOOD This is probably the best California Pizza Kitchen in the US.  The hosts are always friendly and once seated with appetizers (chicken lettuce wraps are bomb) the manager usually walks around and asks how everythings going and thank you for dining with them.  The food is always great and consistent. I usually get the Moroccan- Spiced Chicken Salad, California Club pizza or sandwich. SERVICE If theres a long wait or even none at all we always head on over to the best spot, the bar section.  Boyfriend and I would go around 2x a month to this location and always sat at the bar because of Mike.  He is an outgoing, friendly sportsbuff who knows a lot about NFL, NBA, golf and pays attention to every single customer.  Always making sure we have enough bread, our glasses are never empty and the food is served to or liking.

Things that went wrong on this visit: 1) I'm given the pager and told it will be about 20 minutes....over 35 minutes before getting buzzed 2)Server takes forever to greet us after be seating for quite a long time 3)Pizza's are delivered to the table before the appetizers. 4)Why can I fold my ""Thin Crust"" pizza? Bottom of the pizza soft, sent it back and was told that it would take just a long to remake a new one. 5)5-10 minutes and appetizers still have not arrived. 6)Appetizer and salad finally arrive and Egg rolls are not hot.. 7)Server comes by and I'm told it would be another 3 minutes before my pizza would be out. 8)10-15 minutes past,no sign of server,pizza and everyone else is almost done eating. 9)Noticed the the other table had their waitress check on them twice and had their waters refilled twice.....No sign of our server...No water refills... 10)No sense of urgency to correct a mistake and you would think that our server would be extra attentive. Hard to be extra when you weren't from the beginning. Things that went right on this visit: 1)Manager came over and apologized about the pizza. Also about the egg rolls. 2)I cancelled the pizza.. 3)I did't get mad and go off on the manager. 4)I do forgive my server because she is slow and shouldn't be working there or given a smaller section..like two tables. 5)Manager gave me a free appetizer on the next visit. I really didn't want it but Thank You. When will I come back to CPK: 1)When the planets are not aligned. 2)When hopefully I get a different server. 3)When they can follow through with what is told to me. *Note: CPK if you're going to cut back please don't do it on your service.

Mark M.,"Aiea, HI",461,434,310,3.0,7/16/2013,"I love California Pizza Kitchen because above all other things, they are consistent in every aspect. The ambiance, the food, the service.. all things are consistent. That has held true for many years until yesterday. I'm not sure what happened here. Maybe the stars weren't aligned, maybe our server was new. Who knows. It certainly wasn't busy so I can count that possibility out. Anyways, here is what happened. When we sat down, I had a question for our server. I told her the last time that we were here, I downloaded the Pizza Dough app on my iPhone which is supposed to get you a free small plate for registering. She told me that she would look it up for me to let me know what kind of offers I have and she also asks me for my check in code at this time. She took our order, and then told us she'd bring bread for us as well. When she walked by about ten minutes later, she reminded us that she would bring us some bread. Maybe she forgot, I don't know. Our entrees come out a short while later and I start to enjoy my pizza and she starts to enjoy her shrimp pasta. We receive our bread five minutes after the entrees come out. By this time (about 230p) the restaurant starts to empty out even more and the restaurant is almost empty . After we stop eating, we ask our server for boxes and it was an approximate wait time of fifteen minutes for her to bring us our boxed food, to drop off the check, and to pick it up after we slipped our card in the guest check holder. She never did tell us what offer we still have in regards to the Pizza Dough app. And I did not get the credit from that meal in my account. It was a sad day at the Pizza Kitchen for me. This one experience isn't going to stop me from coming because as I've said before, there's always been a high level of consistency. But hopefully the management will read this and realize that there might be something wrong with the phone app.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=200

Edward H.,"Honolulu, HI",11,4,,3.0,4/23/2015,"I'm going to preface this by saying that my wife and I have worked in the food service industry for over 30 years. My in-laws brought us here tonight, because it was my daughters 11th birthday and she wanted to go. We started off with a 30 minute wait for seats, they were quite busy so it's perfectly understandable for a six top, not too bad. 1. The food: After we were seated, our server was right on it and had drinks on the way immediately. After we ordered, bread was brought to us while we waited, the food came out very quickly, about 15 minutes. Everything was quite good, on a scale of 1 to 10, I would give them a solid 7. The portions were enough, but not overly generous. Again, well done CPK.  2. Service: In a word, Terrific! Our server was Chris, and he was great. He completely took care of us. As I said, my wife and I have some experience in this. We've dined in virtually all of the finest restaurants in Honolulu and experienced the full range of service. Chris did better than some fine dining waiters, with considerably less assistance. Awesome job Chris, and Thank You! A solid 10! 3. Atmosphere: This is where they lose me. In a word LOUD. I've never been a fan of the open kitchen, spiffy cafeteria format. I don't get the allure of having to yell to speak to the person sitting next to me, with loud music piped in as a bonus. I enjoy a good rock concert, just not when I'm having dinner with the family. Some of this has to do with the choice of building materials, all hard surfaces, nothing to absorb the sound, as well as the normal kitchen noise. A McDonalds is quieter. Roy's Hawaii Kai has the same format, it's the reason we don't go back. Ownership please take note. A solid 2.

My Garlic Cream Fettuccine was awful.  I ordered it since some prior reviews raved about it and was sorely disappointed.  Perhaps the chef who made it was having an off day?  The texture of the pasta was off, all the sauce seemed to have evaporated (no, seriously, there was only an uneven coating of ""cream""), and incredibly under seasoned.  I had to sprinkle salt onto it and even then only managed to finish half of the dish. My friends ordered the Caramelized Peach Salad, BBQ Chicken Pizza, and Baja Fish Tacos.  The salad was nice and refreshing, the pizza was pretty good, but the tacos were not that great.  Our Spinach Artichoke Dip was delicious as always though!  And this location gives noticeably more chips and dip than the Ala Moana location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=200

Crissy K.,"Honolulu, HI",392,394,234,4.0,11/3/2014,"According to their website (and other sources), the Kahala restaurant is the busiest CPK in the world. If you've ever seen the dozens of people lining the hall outside, you don't doubt this statistic. So minus one star for the inability to make a spur-of-the-moment group lunch date, but all the positives about this location far outweigh that one downside! CPK Kahala recently underwent a pretty expensive renovation. At first glance, it seems like they just swapped out some furniture and moved the check-in counter . . . but then you go inside, and you realize it goes waaaaaay back, and the dining area is actually now very long. The restrooms are well-lit and neat, too. And about half of the wall art seems to be local, which is a nice touch! Oh, and in case you missed having the grated parmesan and dried pepper shakers already at your table, those are back now, too: You don't have to ask for them anymore. The service at this location was already excellent, but it seems as though the staff has recently undergone some additional training, as even more staff stop what they're doing to thank you for your patronage while you're on your way out.  Another cool aspect of the Kahala restaurant is the convenience of their takeout. As with any other CPK, you can place your order online, but the extra here is that you can pick up your order without having to go into the restaurant proper, as the takeout counter interface is outside. The Kahala location's takeout is also reported to be the busiest of their takeout counters in the country. Again, if you've ever seen the line of people picking up their orders, you don't even question this. One of my favorite takeout items: catering-sized salads, especially the Moroccan chicken salad. Pricey, yes, but also impressive in size, appearance and quality of ingredients.  In terms of menu selection, CPK is CPK. The chain is constantly adjusting (mostly raising) prices and changing around their food items, but there are so many good-to-great choices, I never get tired of it.

Lyla D.,"Honolulu, HI",541,1014,13824,4.0,6/23/2015,"We stopped in here to have lunch since we were in the area.  They've completed their renovation with warm rustic wood tables and floors. The décor is decidedly warmer and not so ""sterile"" looking plus they've expanded their seating area into the mall.   As a Pizza Dough rewards member, I received an offer for $10 discount with $40 or more purchase.  Once seated, I informed our waitress, Jessica, of my check-in number and discount offer.  Jessica was friendly and top-notch efficient.  From the time she greeted us to presenting the bill, she checked with us several times and was never intrusive.  She refilled our iced teas without us even asking, made sure that our food came out on time and that the flavors were pleasing.   So, what did we order? Well, we're sort of creatures of habit so we happily ordered a full-sized Cobb salad and a Wild Mushroom Pizza. As we dined, I noticed the placard featuring CPK's Summer Strawberry beverages and desserts.  My eyes fixated on the Strawberry Shortcake while I munched on the delicious thin-crust pizza.  As we were finishing our meal, Jessica noted that we were just $5 away from spending $40 and we'd miss out on the discount if we didn't order anything more.  Well, we weren't going to let that happen so we ordered the Strawberry Shortcake à la mode.  We were quite full from sharing that huge salad and pizza but, the dessert just pushed us into food coma.  The light biscuit was complimented with fresh strawberry slices in syrup and topped with a huge dollop of whipped cream along with crystallized lemon zest.  That dessert didn't last very long on our table as we dove into it with wild abandon.   CPK Kahala didn't disappoint as we had received wonderful service, great flavors and good value.  Granted, this location doesn't have any scenic views to speak of like at its Ala Moana site.

Cups, crayons, food, napkins and other crap should not have been thrown on the floor when your kids are older and aren't in booster seats or high chairs. My three year old was more behaved than that. I'm hoping you left an amazing tip!) Anyways, we ordered the flat bread, a children's pizza, ahi tacos and penne pasta. The children's pizza had pepperoni which was way to spicy for my son. Even Cam thought that it was spicy. The flat bread was pretty good, it had Gorgonzola, mozzarella and truffle oil!

She then went on to say, ""did you bring anyone to help you?""  When my asst replied no, she was told ""well, I guess you'll be making multiple trips"". What happened to customer service?  2 guys that were standing around that don't even work there offered to help her take the order to the car.

Lance B.,"Honolulu, HI",0,16,,5.0,1/5/2017,"I wanted to leave a review to acknowledge the management and wait staff at this place. This post was going to be a 1 star for the poor performance of the hostess, but the manager, and then the waiter ,Chris, rallied back in such spectacular manner that I am going with a 5. Arrived at the restaurant around 6:15 and was told there was a 40 min wait. It's my son's favorite place so we decided to wait. At 7:00 I went to check with hostess, and was told it would be 10 more minutes. at 7:15 same thing. Finally seated at 7:20. I get this is a popular place, and that you can't control how long people linger at their tables, but this place didn't just open - they know the patterns - how about telling me its an hour and then surprising me when it only 40 minutes? Or... if you tell me 40 minutes, and at 35 minutes there is no chance you are going to seat me in the next 15 to 20 minutes - let me know so  can make a decision about whether or not to wait it out. The place is obviously beyond its capacity so the few people that decide to bail out will not impact the revenue for the night, and at least they wont be pissed. So the recovery - the manager was waiting at our table to apologize (we didn't ask him to do this). He let me and my wife complain about the wait and never interrupted or made any excuses. He offered to comp our appetizers, which we told him he didn't have to do. At the end of the meal he took them off the bill anyway! The waiter, Chris, was also very attentive, and made sure everything going forward was perfect. We have had him before, and this guy is a pro. If CPK doesn't promote this guy to their customer service guru, they are missing out.

Tracy K.,"Honolulu, HI",635,157,1488,5.0,1/6/2014,"CPK is on that ""Top 5"" list of eateries in my mind when you need a go-to place to catch up with friends. And because I have a bunch of girlfriends that 1) love to eat and 2) love to catch up WHILE eating, it's nice to have a quick place to blurt out. The convo usually goes a little something like this: (text message) ""Hey Trace! I miss you! Let's get together soon!"" ""Sure! You choose the place and I'm there!"" ""I'll eat anywhere as long as I get to see you!"" ""Same here. I'm down for anything. What about ____?"" Now this girl-to-girl conversation can bounce back and forth a few more thumb smashings until someone throws out a restaurant name. And while there are a TON of new eateries that grace the island scene, not all fit between that magic combo of good selection, comfortable price point, and convenience.  CPK is my fall back restaurant, any day. Any time.  I've loved their food since I was a little girl, and especially when I was in high school watching my older sister hang out with her cool chef friends getting free food. You can probably name a fun time in your life that happened at a CPK restaurant: a birthday, a surprise party, a big secret you had to tell your best friend...actually, I've had all three! Recently, CPK has revamped their menu to attract a healthier crowd with smaller bites, fresher veggie ingredients on their pizzas, and serving bread with oil and herbs instead of butter packets. But let me break it down DJ Tracy stylez how I like to rock the CPK turntables (scratching the 1s and 2s): 1. SPINACH ARTICHOKE DIP. Classic. The CPK recipe book unveils the secret behind the dipping magic created by approx two dozen ingredients including, (get this), tabasco. 2. Avocado Eggrolls. The name screams a 2, but the taste is a 10. What they fail to mention is that there is Bacon. Turkey. Cheese. INSIDE these rolls. AND they come with two dipping sauces in herb ranch and a spicy ranchito sauce. Fireworks in your mouth. For entrees, you can go with their BBQ chicken pizza, cobb salad, spinach asparagus pasta with salmon, or any of the few dozen other menu selections. I've taken a liking to the Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza.  Oh, oh. And don't forget to ask for CHOLULA hot sauce. And more cheese (boy do I love cheese). My favorite part of every meal is dessert. And CPK got you covered with their famous Chocolate Souffle: a warm, oozing disc of molten chocolate goodness that kisses your lips with a side of rich Haagen Daaz vanilla bean ice cream. Oh lord.... Haven't convinced you yet? Why not treat yourself to a Red Velvet Cake? Or perhaps their newer desserts like the Salted Caramel Pudding or Fresh Fruits with Vanilla Sabayon? Seasonally, CPK will offer various menu items like the Butter Cake with Fresh Strawberries and whipped cream on top. Now THAT is heaven in your mouth.  And most recently, the fiance and I tried their Ace Hard Pear Cider that tasted like Jolly Rancher candy if they made it in pear flavor. I also like to wash down my meal with peach iced tea if I'm going alcohol-free.  Whatever the occasion, whatever the selection, CPK is guaranteed to win you over with their consistent customer service and classic ingredients that won't break the budget.  Hail to the CPK!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=120

They always go out of their way to help. For example, we always have a large group, including babies, and they are most attentive to keep drinks filled, bring bread, and accommodate our menu change requests.  It has one of the largest menus for pizza in Honolulu, and there are both meat and vegetarian options. Their Waldorf salad is one of the best I've ever had.

Anne C.,"Honolulu, HI",22,23,37,1.0,1/6/2014,"This past Saturday night, I witnessed  something really disgusting at the restaurant.  I was just about to take my first bite of my food, when I noticed the 8-10 year old boy throwing up on the table across from ours.  His family had a very slow reaction to him, instead of taking him quickly  to the bathroom they let him go on and on to the different area of the table and so forth.  He did eventually go to the bathroom, but came back and still hung around with the family for another 15 minutes to decide who is taking the leftover home etc... I mean, why do you still care about the food, its been contaminated!   All the family members should leave quickly so we don't have to endure the sight and smell.  I just couldn't believe how slow the manager reacted or didn't react.  The table next to them left with disgust. My complaint to this is, the way the crew clean the area was not sufficient.  They quickly took away the plates, moved the chairs and tables to make room to accommodate more guests, since its a busy Saturday night.  I saw how they ""clean"" the area, didn't disinfect the tables, booths, and chairs.  They should of clean the contaminated area and not use the tables and clean it thoroughly after the restaurant closed.  This shows how management is only thinking about $$ than the well being of the patrons. I made a statement to the waiter and the waiter send the rude manager over to me.  He assured me that the ""red bucket"" did the cleaning and killed all the germs. Well, like I told him, the red bucket don't mean anything if you just put it on the table. From my observation, the area was still contaminated with bacterias.  He didn't apologized for what I went through.  Just glad I saw everything and not my kids or their cousins, or else we might of had a bad chain reaction.

I spoke to a representative, who wasn't even apologetic, and who transferred me to the take out extension.  Aaaaaand waited 20 minutes on hold. As an experiment, I used my sisters phone to call the takeout line (while still on hold on my landline) and was promptly answered (strange...). I explained what happened, and was answered not with concern, but ""uuuuuuhhh let me transfer you to the manager.""  Great.. More waiting? I don't think so.

Josh V.,"Honolulu, HI",0,2,,1.0,4/3/2017,"Worst experience of my life. To top it off, I did not even sit down to eat. They do not take reservations, so I went early to get in line. Upon arriving the hostess told me it would be 1 hour wait time for 11 people. While I waited for 1 hour, I saw multiple parties, as big as 8 go in before me. Mind you, these parties were in line after me. After an hour I asked the hostess how much longer and she stated she told me in the beginning 1 hour to 1.5 hours. I had 4 little children in my party so I'm pretty irritated by now. 1.5 hours passed by and still no table. At this point I have seen people that reserved tables after me go in, eat their food, and  walk out the door. Finally, the manager came out and said they are waiting for 1 more party that was taking a while. This was the last straw, my party decided to go somewhere else. This is the first time in my life I've ever left an establishment. To give you a time frame, I put my name in for a table at 645pm and left at 830, and still without a table. In the end it turned out well though. We went to a much better establishment, mac 24/7, food was excellent and most important the customer service was on point.

We got to the mall at around 6:45 p.m. the waiting area of CPK looked a bit crowded so we decided to hold off eating for another half hour or so and check back again. We were happy to find that waiting a bit was the best decision. We put in our name and was seated within 10-12 minutes. YAY!  Our server was a friendly young local guy. He was efficient, smart and very accommodating. We ordered our food and he quickly brought out our drinks and bread. He was  super busy managing his other tables but always seemed to come right back to us to see if we needed anything or think ahead of what we would need. Extra napkins? check.; more water... check, kids need a water cup too.... check. Not only was our server awesome, but his manager walked around filling up iced tea, soda, and water throughout the restaurant. Love management who don't mind working hard. Awesome example.  We ordered our favorites:  avocado egg rolls, kids meal in mac n cheese and alfredo, bbq chop salad with avocados. We were happy campers! Food came out hot and fresh and...... quickly!

Kim M.,"Honolulu, HI",2771,835,1320,3.0,10/2/2011,"On Labor Day the bf and I decided to go to CPK to use up a gift card we had. We went at an ""off"" time to avoid the peak lunch hour and the 1.5 hour wait. Our wait was about 15 minutes. Once seated, we waited for 10-15 minutes without any acknowledgment of our presence, until I got up and asked. As it turned out, the woman I spoke with actually was our server. She apologetically took full responsibility for slipping up. (Such a rarity.) She came right over, apologized once again, and took our order. The manager also came to our table, apologized, and comped two of our appetizers. After seeing empty plates, our server dropped the dessert menu. The bf and I exchanged looks--we had just finished our appetizers and hadn't gotten our ""entree"" yet. Just as we are discussing how our salad was forgotten, some guy tries to drop our check. When I enlighten him on the situation, he apologizes and scurries away.  Our salad finally arrived and our server came over to apologize once again. Her explanation: there were other people running the food over to our table, so she thought we had already received our salad.  Long story short: our whole meal was comped because of the wacky service. How do you screw up more than once with the same table? I'd think after the first slip up, the server would be way more cautious and wary.  I still have the gift card, but will probably use it at a different CPK to avoid another ""incident.""  I'd like to give Kahala CPK another shot, but not any time soon. Walking out of CPK that day felt extremely awkward, like a walk of shame.

This makes the overall review a bit skewed toward the negative side, so I thought I'd just drop a line on the good time I almost always have here. But at this cpk specifically.  There's something about the kahala branch of this chain that is like your cool cousins from the suburbs that have a lake house & awesome family compared to the other cousins you have that you were forced to play with sometimes during holidays that were into that weird religion and put way too much mayo on sandwiches and also liked BOTH anchovies AND pineapple pizza.  anyway yeah this cpk is ALWAYS banging.

She was so helpful in helping me decide between two soups and let me try em both! she always had a joke while around, i don't know. It's not expected from me for waiters/waitresses to be conversationalists because i know a lot of dine in guests can be unresponsive & awkward if asked anything other than ""What can I get for you?"" And even a few years ago when I came here with my dad the food took an especially long time to arrive, like people came after us and ate and left, because it was just busy and our order got lost or something. But they apologized and the food was on the house! only thing we paid for was dessert & wine and that was so nice. I wasn't angry at all cause late food is a dumb as hell reason to get upset over ESPECIALLY when a place is busy + it was handled so professionally. No excuses, just that's what happened. And a lot of places don't cover the bill over mistakes like that unless the server felt especially bad and wanted to pay. I hope no one had to immediately pay out of pocket for that, so we tipped well. Plus food is reliable in taste & the red velvet cake is sweeeeeet. ugh im crying thinking about the artichoke dip.

Randi K.,"Honolulu, HI",88,12,,1.0,10/27/2013,"How terrible do you have to be to be my first Yelp review? This terrible... I'm with everyone else, has this location changed managers? This used to be my go-to CPK location...until today. I came with a friend to grab a meal before a movie, 3 hours later. They seated us very quickly for a Sunday afternoon which left us brainstorming how we could kill time after our meal before the movie. After two hours in the restaurant, we no longer have that quagmire.  After being seated, we waited 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge our presence. A waiter, not our own, noticed we were being neglected and came over to help us. We ordered our entrees and proceeded to wait 40 minutes for our food. My chicken/pasta dish arrived barely warm and I waited another 10 minutes before our waitress finally noticed the barely touched food in front of me. She offered to have the kitchen re-warm it and took it back.  Wait another 15 minutes, my entree is returned to me, replated but now overcooked from being rewarmed. Give the waitress some more time to notice my barely touched food, and they finally offer to remake my order. Finally, an hour and a half after arriving I received an edible, albeit mediocre entree. After finishing, we wait another 15 minutes for our waitress to box our food and bring the check. I wanted to pay with cash, simply because I didn't want to wait for her to run my card but I needed all the cash I had, so we were forced to wait while she took another 10 minutes to run our cards.  On top of all of that, we had to repeatedly ask for bread, butter, and refills of our water. Our waitress was frazzled and we felt like an inconvenience to the restaurant. Funny thing, the restaurant wasn't even full. It was probably at half capacity when we arrived.  Although the manager checked on us to ask things were okay after my entree fiasco, we did not receive an apology.  No discount. No comp. Never again CPK Kahala.

Ashley O.,"Seattle, WA",92,33,106,2.0,10/8/2013,"Very disappointed with this location. Been here twice. First time was awesome, with exceptional service. But when going here yesterday, many aspects seemed to have gone downhill.  After deciding rather last-minute, I celebrated my birthday here with my roommates. The wait wasn't horrible, but our waitress was! When seated, she came to our table and offered to take our drink order: ""Hi, want to get started with drinks? You're all too young...we have soda and water."" Lady. Two of my roommates are legal to drink. Don't assume. Luckily one of my roommates proved her wrong and ordered a beer, much to the waitress's surprise upon checking her ID. No apology, but took the order and walked off.  For what seemed like forever later, she came back with the beer and took our food order. The food arrived and it was pretty tasty. We ordered the BBQ chicken and California club pizza, and also a pasta (I believe chicken penne alfredo). When mentioning it was my birthday, the waitress said, ""Oh, we can embarrass her then?"". Normally I would have joked along, but she didn't say it in a friendly tone. She handed me the dessert menu, and my roommate asked for the check. She said, ""she hasn't ordered her dessert yet"",  which confused us as she made it seem as if the dessert was my birthday treat. She walked away, but we asked another waitress for clarification. You get a free birthday sundae, but anything from the dessert menu costs. Couldn't our waitress have said that in the first place!? The birthday sundae came, and it was a decent size! Vanilla ice cream with chocolate fudge sauce and some chocolate chips. Really gooey, delicious, and perfect for a sweet tooth like myself. Came with a maraschino cherry and candle. Cute. Finally getting our check, it wasn't separated when we asked prior. Our waitress would continually stop by our table momentarily and walk away before we had the chance to talk to her, so we didn't bother waiting for her to return to separate our checks. We all paid our amount on the same bill, and needless to say, our waitress she earned a real low tip!  I haven't had an issue with the service at the Ala Moana and Waikiki CPK locations. It's probably that one waitress we had (a middle-aged Asian woman with a ton of ear piercings...watch out for her)!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=240

I usually get this spagettini dish with asparagus that is so simple, but so tasty that it hardly makes it to leftover status.

Because, not only is the food good, but it's a clean and friendly place. Last night my friend ordered the creamy garlic linguine. We both didn't like it at first, so when the waitress came back to check up on us, we told her about it. In less than 5 mins, a new-and-improved pasta come and OMG!!!  It was sooooo good!  So yah....if you don't like it, send it back and they'll totally re-make it. I'm hopeful that they didn't spit in it though.... Oh, and this particular venue is awesome because they always welcome kids to visit. They do special school visits, where kids come and make their own little pizza and eat it right in the restaurant. Pretty cool!

Secondly: They told us after mistakenly buzzing us that it would be about 45 mins, I ended up waiting way over an hours. And while we were waiting off to the side the Hostesses kept looking at us and then laughing like it was some sort of joke. Not cool. Third: They sit us all the way in the back of the restaurant where all these young kids are screaming their heads off and crying (horrible to hear during dinner, I sometimes wasn't even able to keep up with my group and I's conversation) Fourth: We said no onions on the pizza and no celery in the salad, but we still got it anyways.  Fifth: Usually we always get the cheese and chili flakes give right away with our pizza but we had to ask and she didn't even bring it!

I felt like eating healthy and asked Kurt how the cedar plank salmon was.  He said it was good but the vegetables that come with it are a little spicy.  He recommended substituting with chimichurri veggies which was really tasty.  The salmon was moist & delicious. My bf ordered his usual Jamaican Jerk Pizza.  It's one of his favorites there and he says the Kahala CPK is very consistent with the preparation. They were unusually busy that night, even for them, so we were pleasantly surprised that the food came out in about 10-15 minutes.  We expected a longer wait, especially since we could see the cooks working so hard right in front of us, and the tickets lined up. Despite being really busy, Kurt remembered to check up on us periodically, refilling my water, offering a second drink for my bf.  He kept a smile on his face while dealing with all the customers and his co-workers.  Another thing my bf noticed is how all the workers in general seemed to get along.  Maybe that's how they keep things running smoothly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=240

You can order online for pickup which is a feature I value greatly!  To me, CPK food is designer trendy food. The food is good but it's the idea and atmosphere that you're paying a premium for. The BBQ chicken pizza is delicious (without cilantro please) except now you can buy a frozen BBQ chicken pizza from the grocery store for way cheaper and it actually doesn't taste too bad. For a bit more traditional taste I recommend the Five Cheese+Fresh tomato. My only complaint about this pizza is that one of the cheeses is a little too pungent for my taste.  My favorite thing to order is the garlic cream fettuccine with mushrooms and spinach fettuccine noodles. I've convinced myself that it's healthier to get spinach fettuccine (yeah I know it's really not.)  Just a heads up, This location gets busy.

Daisy V.,"Honolulu, HI",3,369,,2.0,8/9/2015,"We waited 15, 20 minutes before a server came to see us.  We weren't in her section, but she saw us looking irritated and noted our glances around the restaurant looking for wait help, she she came to our table to check in, then promised she would find the person.  Few seconds later, she returned, apologized, and stated that she would serve us. She was on point the whole time, fast, courteous, refilling water, getting us the bread and butter quickly (given that we were already hungry and annoyed when she first engaged us), and checking in with other things, on a regular basis.  Efficient service, though she was obviously slammed. We tipped well, but it was clear that she was on her own, alone with her good work ethic--and that whatever other server who was supposed to be working that section, was out to lunch. Yet:  why didn't a manager figure out how to handle this, rather than her?  She did apologize and say the restaurant was short staffed; she did very professional work, trying not to diss anyone in particular or make the establishment look bad, though we had been ready to walk out, if she didn't come along.   Management seems to be missing here--should be able to handle something as basic as being 1-2 people short of the schedule, during peak lunch time. Anyways, about the food... I had simple stuff, hummus and pita with a large bowl of tortilla soup.  It was the living definition of blah.  Pita was not toasted but micro-waved; I don't expect it crispy but do expect something beyond what I could do at home with my super-limited culinary skills.  Hummus was competently made though bland, with not enough chives/green onions sprinkled around the plate, to make it savory or interesting. Tortilla soup was kind of flat, with little spice in it, or interesting chopped veggies.  It tasted, frankly, canned. I'm not sure if these are complaints for the particular CPK branch or the whole chain/franchise.  When did this food become so uninspired and not fresh tasting?  Could it be because they have such a lock on the location--one of the few consistent food places in this mall where you can sit and eat and have a supposedly ""nice"" meal--that they simply don't care?  Or what the larger chain is poorly managed, from wait help to the cooking line?  They are truly just maintaining and cruising off the goodwill of a yuppie/middle-class professional population that seems not to give a shit. My friend and I could've bought the same meal from Whole Foods' refrigerated prepared foods sections, tossed it into the microwave, and the taste and textures would've been the same. These guys are literally getting away with the bare minimum.  No roaches in your meal, no egregiously bad cooking, and occasionally competent wait service admidst crushingly mediocre management.  Yay team.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=220

WTF?  didn't i come here so that YOU GUYS would make my pizza?   also, the new korean tacos are shitty - it tasted more like bbq beef (not the korean kind, the overly sweet kind....).  it was not good, and only comes with 2 small tacos.  the service this past visit was not the best i've experienced.  our server, while friendly, didn't really check on us, and only refilled drinks/water at the end when we were going to leave already.    MEH.  too bad.... i usually like cpk, but this revamp of the duck pizza was abysmal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=220

We had a movie to see in 1.75 hours so I didn't want to risk being late.  Anyway, maybe it's just me but I would have said something like ""oh, I'm sorry about that"" orrrrr something.   We ended up going to Grilt and Whole Foods (which was definitely money well spent for half the expense) but of course we didn't have the table service or the ambiance.  That's okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=220

The wait time averages from about 30 min to 45 min most of the time. Parking can be difficult but if you are having difficulty, I recommend parking in other areas of the mall and walking. Service is always friend and nice, but slow. I don't mind though. I never like to feel rushed when I'm at a restaurant. As long as you can find your server when you need them, I'm happy.  My favorites at this restaurant are their avocado egg rolls, original bbq chicken chopped salad, and chicken tequila fettuccine. I recently discovered that I could switch my type of pasta and I have to say that I've fallen in love! If you love the chicken tequila, try it with a skinnier pasta like linguine or spaghetti. The pasta absorbs the sauce so much better an makes the dish so much tastier. It's been on my mind ever since I discovered it! I think I might go back for a second round.

The place was packed as usual but we were able to snag seats at the bar avoiding a wait.  Sitting at the bar can make for a great experience.  Our bartender Michael was awesome.  We ordered the avocado egg roll appy which was delicious.  I wasn't too hungry so I went for the quesadilla on the small plate menu.  I'm a fan of the small plate menu!  It was tiny so don't expect much but it was perfect for my appetite at the time. Hubby did his famous ""surprise me"" tactic, and was presented with a cedar plank salmon and succotash.  I guarantee he never would have ordered that himself at CPK, but it was juicy and cooked to perfection.   We had a lovely time, but I'm still mourning the loss of my fave.  PLEASE BRING BACK THE MISO SALAD!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=220

If you're a small eater like me, this is more than enough food and you don't feel like you're going to explode at the end.  Sometimes I order their chicken piccata but it's really lemon-y and can get a little much at times.

I used to love ordering the Tomato Basil Spaghettini. It was my go to pasta dish. But since it re-vamped the menu, they got rid of it. :( In place of that pasta dish, I like to order either the caramelized peach salad (when I'm feeling a little bit healthy). The salad has a little to many red onions for my liking since I'm not a big onion fan. Be prepared to have a piece of gum afterwards! As for pizza, I lean towards the Margherita pizza because it has cheese AND tomatoes which are my to favorite.  (This is what I order when I'm craving junk food or when I'm craving a tomato sauce). The crust is thin and crunchy and has just the right amount of chewyness. As a starter, I love to have the avocado club rolls. It has big chunks of avocado, bacon, and cheese inside all deep friend (I believe) with two sauce choices. I'm drooling just typing about this! I love that they started their rewards card. If you accumulate 100$ of spendings on your card, you get 5$ off your next purchase. Also, they have scratch cards during a certain time of year which are really fun to use. 10% off your meal is the minimum reward so you get something no matter what!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=220

I just want to take a moment to mention that the spinach artichoke dip is really good as an appetizer as well, and the pizzas that I like to get here with thin honey wheat crust are: pear & gorgonzola, Japanese eggplant, and pesto chicken.  I feel like they skimp on the seafood in the Miso salad, which is kind of a shame.  Otherwise, I really like this place.  Solid food, great service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=260

Chris O.,"Seattle, WA",367,315,904,4.0,1/26/2011,"Did you know that CPK Kahala Mall is the busiest CPK in the nation? And the second busiest is CPK Ala Moana? That's what our bartender said, and I'm not surprised since both locations are constantly packed and waits average 1.5 hours for Friday and Saturday nights.  Sicilian Pizza. This is hands down my favorite pizza from CPK, I could easily eat this on every visit. Thin crust, Italian sausage, spicy capicola, and julienne salami makes my mouth salivate just thinking about it.  Some other notable pizzas I've tried, and liked are the four seasons, white pizza, pepperoni supremo, and the five cheese.  For an appetizer, the avocado club egg rolls are excellent. The creaminess of the avocado, saltiness from the bacon, the crunch of the wonton roll, all brought together with some monterey jack cheese! It doesn't stop there, you get two dipping sauces, ranchito sauce (use this) and herb ranch dressing.  A service that I've been using lately is CPK's Order Online ( ) which is super convenient for those busy bodies. Simple select the location you wish to pick up from, choose your items, make any adjustments (no green onions, extra cheese, etc.), and submit. You then have the option to pay online or pay when you pick up. From the time you order till the pick up, CPK will arbitrarily give you a 1 hour wait (or so it seems for all my online orders), so plan accordingly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=260

As we were going to the table they realized the table wasn't ready yet so they had us sit on the side on the couches, which are somewhat in the corner. As we were sitting there we saw a few other parties come in. All of them were able to get seats while we were still waiting! After about 10 minutes we looked for the nearest waiter and asked about our seats. Apparently they ""didn't know"" we were sitting there and we couldn't find the host who had previously helped us.

I like this location for the convenience - it is between my home and work - and that it is in Kahala Mall helps for parking purposes and if you need to run to Longs or Whole Foods on the way out :) I particularly like the Thai Crunch Salad with Chicken, the Chopped Salad is also good.  I like that their salads taste freshly made and are always crispy.  My first pizza here was the Thai Chicken Pizza on Wheat crust - yum!  The crust is crispy and a little nutty flavored so it really goes well with the spicy peanut sauce.  I still order that as one of my favorites.   They now have pastas to choose from and specialty items like Salmon on a plank!  Their Apple Pie Ala Mode is really good for a comfort type of dessert - with creamy vanilla ice cream melting over the top of the pie  - sooo good.   The food is always cooked well and the service is fast, oh the pricing is just right great for families and individuals alike. If you do go to this location a few tips: - Several of the parking spaces in front of the restaurant are 15 minute parking only for take out so make sure you avoid those stalls otherwise you will get ticketed. - You have to try the Mac and Cheese just once - it is awesome!  5 cheeses in their Mac and Cheese - Go early or about 30 minutes before you want to eat as this place always has a line - to wait half an hour is not unusual in the evenings and an hour even on weekends!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=260

So much more value elsewhere. And their salads are not healthy. So much cheese, butter and oil. I have the waiter hold those, but then I feel like its even less of a value of what I'm paying for. Its not like they discount it when I remove what I don't want. And if you opt for the extras, like avocado, tomatoes, chicken, shrimp, that will crank you another $3+ each! Lordy! And their new menu items lately, are even smaller portions than ever! Whoa! I drive past and go to places like Super Pho on Waialae these days. I can order 5 different dishes, pho, 2 salads, fried chicken wings, lemon grass chicken, and still be under $50. Choke food and got leftovers for tomorrow.

We walked around Macy's for a bit went into the stationary store, all with in the area that the host said the receiver would reach. Well it came upon the 1hr marker and still no call on the reciver. So we decided to head back to CPK. Now we are hitting the 1.15 marker and we notice a new customer getting seated before us but it was only 2 of them so we figures that is the reason. So we go up to the host and ask how much longer. He was trying to find our name on the 3 sheets in front of him. Then he said your next. So we sat at the waiting area right next to CPK. Then we notice that another couple gets seated before us not 5 minutes after the host said we were next and to top it off they were seated at a booth that can seat 4. So we head up and complain about it and the girl that was standing next to host said ""well we were calling you"" with attitude. Um excuse me but the receiver never buzzed, and plus we were sitting no more than 20ft from you. I would of rather you told us that you made a mistake and over looked our name instead of saying you called us and actually didn't.  Ala moana is twice as busy on the weekends and not once has this happened to us.

When we first got there, the line was very long.  We totally understand that CPK usually takes a while for seating-especially because we requested a booth-we always do.  However, when our pager finally went off and we followed a waiter into CPK, we were seated at a table.  My family never gets irritated about these minor issues.  But we have been waiting almost an hour and a half for our booth, and could clearly see three open.  The waiter apologized when we told him what we requested, and brought us to the back.  He started to put down the menus and waited for us to get seated.  At another table!  We told him once more we requested a booth.  He then took us to the front and told us to wait a couple more minutes on the little seating area inside.  We were tired and hungry, and so this was quite annoying.  As we waited, three more families got seated inside the booths we were supposed to have.  One of my family members talked to the waiter, and he talked to the manager.  The waiter told him that we had demanded to be seated right away so that's why he seated us at a table-not true.  We waited almost two hours for the table.  We didn't care anymore and sat at the half booth the manager sat us in-we were just hungry.  He brought us an appetizer as an apology.  Even though we waited way longer then we were supposed to, the manager was very nice and understanding, and was good at calming us down.  I really did appreciate his gesture and want to thank him for that.  We will be coming back here, but I will remember this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=280
Jason P.,"Honolulu, HI",16,29,,3.0,1/7/2014,"Seating was pretty quick and we didn't have to wait long. Our server, East, greeted us shortly after we were seated and took down our drink orders after offering us a water or iced tea. It took less than a minute for her to return with our strawberry Italian sodas and waters however we only got one container of cream where we usually get two containers. Shortly after we got the bread, only 3 pieces...not sure why when I've always gotten 5 pieces between 2 people... We ordered a Chicken Picatta and Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage Pizza which took over 30 minutes to reach us. The food was good, no complaints on that, however when we got a second Italian soda, I requested more cream since our container was only about half full. Our server told me that it was still full. After telling her never mind she later returned with another container of cream regardless. Despite all of that, our server was polite throughout the meal but was a little absent throughout the night. She came by 4 times total, the first to greet us and take our drink orders, the second to deliver our drinks and take our orders, third to give us refills on our sodas and later bring another thing of cream, and the last to give us our check then returning it with my card.

There seems to be a lot of bad reviews recently but I have not had any complaints so far. I try to avoid regular mealtimes as I would rather not wait 45 minutes to be seated. The servers are usually pretty prompt.  My favorites are the Mediterranean & Baja Tortilla Spring Rolls, Spinach and Artichoke Dip, Dakota Smashed Pea + Barley Soup, Original BBQ Chicken Chopped salad (ask for extra dressing! It has been too light since the new menu), Asparagus + Spinach Spaghettini, Spaghetti Bolognese and California Veggie pizza. Most importantly, their Belgian Chocolate Soufflé (ala mode of course!) is amazing!  CPK has evolved so much in the twenty plus years I have been going. The changes are usually not appreciated by me (the uniform and menu changes over the years, no more super-friendly servers, no chopsticks?!, bread, etc).

We waited at the Check in table for about 5 mins just being ignored by the hostess while she looked at her table assignments. She looked at us but just ignored us without saying anything like ""I'll be right with you"". So rude. Then another worker came to tell us that we would have to wait another 25-30 mins because they didn't have enough workers despite half the restaurant being empty. Such bad planning especially since it was a weekend and soon to be dinner crowd. They could have at least treated us politely since it was their fault for under staffing.

Robert C.,"Honolulu, HI",17,32,65,4.0,10/15/2010,"Rating: 4.25/5 Date(s) Visited: 10/8/10 Food: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Atmosphere: 3/5 Price: 4/5 My friend and I had received those customer appreciation mystery coupon things from a previous visit a couple months earlier and decided to use them that night (since they expired that day). Unfortunately everyone else had the same idea. We waited for an hour and ten minutes! When we got in, we weren't disappointed though - we got 50% off! Food: When I opened their menu, it was obvious that they had downsized their appetizer selection quite noticeably. Gone were my usual favorites, replaced by combination dishes. That's fine, though, since I ordered their ""Garlic Cheese Focaccia with Checca"" and their ""Tortilla Spring Rolls"" (two Thai and one Baja). Their ""Garlic Cheese Focaccia with Checca"" was amazing. It was cheesy, herby, garlicky and had just the right amount of salt on it. With their diced Roma tomatoes, I was very impressed. Their spring rolls were a bit disappointing. If you're gonna order three of them, make them all different. As much as I liked the Thai ones, they got boring after only a short period of time. Their Baja rolls were so-so. The only pizza I ever eat at CPK is their ""BBQ Chicken with Applewood Smoked Bacon"". Soft chicken with crunchy bacon and BBQ sauce is the best thing to happen to pizza since pepperoni. Service: Despite the huge rush as a result of CPK's promotion, our server made it seem like they weren't the least bit busy. He was attentive, friendly and more than willing to answer our questions without making us feel the least bit rushed. Definitely award-winning service. Atmosphere: When we first got seated at the back of the restaurant (near the bathrooms!), a young teen party was going on at the main table in the area a few feet away from us. I was dreading how noisy they would be, but fortunately they cleared away after ten minutes and were replaced by better behaved adults, though it did get a bit noisy at times. Other than that, the atmosphere was average. The whole restaurant was noisy and our table was small (way too small for the sheer amount of food we ended up ordering).  Price: We got 50% off everything we ordered, so how can I complain? However, I must base my review on what the normal price would have been. I feel like I generally got a good value, although next time I would definitely skip over the spring rolls. For the price (nearly $12), I think the portions were too small and the flavors less bold than I would have liked. Other than that, it's worth every penny.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=280
Tia S.,"Honolulu, HI",341,184,264,4.0,9/23/2010,"When you can't decide where to go CPK is a great option.

The Kahala location is my favorite. Lots of parking, comfortable seating/waiting area, and good staff. I came in with a friend tonight and we sat at the bar. We were immediately greeted by our animated server, Jason from Kaimuki. He kept us laughing the entire time with his jokes and haole-pidgin slang. I posted his photo, so everyone can ask for him on their next visit. The cooks were fun to watch, as this was my first time sitting this close to the action. They even took the time to answer my questions about the entrees they made. I really enjoyed the open kitchen, because you can appreciate how clean the facility is and the food preparation. The ""small cravings"" menu is helpful for indecisive eaters who just want a light tasting of a larger dish. I got the Mediterranean plate with hummus, feta, greek cucumber salad, and pita. It was very fresh and satisfying. Top it off with a glass of La Crema Pinot Noir and I totally forgot my stressful day in the office.  Pizzas are delicious and creative. The pesto cream penne with chicken AND shrimp is the way to go.

At the bar or at a table, the staff at CPK Kahala Mall have never failed to take care of us. With all of the pizzas they offer CPK is one of those places where you just need to work your way through the menu to figure out what you like. I will say though that the butter cake for dessert is excellent.

After looking up the menu, we decided to try ordering online; it was convenient that we could pay online. I also liked that we were still able to request bread for free & they had a notes section for special orders. We ordered the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken pizza and the Habenero Carnitas pizza. It was 8:45 when we sent the order in and we put 9:15 as the pick up time.  Boyfriend wanted Jamba so we got to Kahala mall & split ways. It was 9:10 & our food was ready to go. The 3 people working were friendly & tried to talk story about my name. Because I paid online, I just showed my card & signed the receipt. I appreciated how quick the entire event was. Our pizzas were super yummy. The carnitas were juicy & the salsa is super spicy (we liked it on the side for dipping). The Hawaiian BBQ chicken pizza was tasty; I enjoyed the chunky pineapple & the smoked Gouda was a nice flavor change. I like to call these artisan pizzas as the New Yorker in me feels guilty.

I don't know what it is, but people in Hawaii are seriously addicted to CPK. When I was in high school, it was the Chinese chicken salad. I just had to have it! What's great is they keep reinventing the menu, while keeping the mainstay items like that salad.  My kids will consistently choose CPK when asked where they want to eat. Is it the chocolate milk that comes with the kids meal? Is it the free birthday dessert? Is it the coloring page and crayons? Or maybe just all our good memories at this ever popular establishment. We will keep CPK in business for a loooooong time. You're welcome!  My fave orders now are: quinoa arugala salad, roasted vegetable salad, Moroccan chicken salad, two in a bowl soup (smashed pea and barley / tortilla soup).

Sure there are times when our server is a little slower but this is also the busiest CPK in the entire corporation so that makes sense. There is a busboy or runner I'm not sure what his exact title is but he is always so attentive and can tell when I need something even if he is across the room.  Also, I am here most of the time with children. This is my go to place if I am watching children or if I'm meeting friends who have children. Kids love it here and you can't beat the price. The kids meals always come out really quickly so that they have something to do and they are eating. The fact that you can get a sundae for the kids for $.99 is pretty magical too.

Helpful hints to the management:  Employees should have a better way to get orders from the kitchen.  Add a dedicated food runner for take out (if there is already one, increase the staff).  Have a beverage station nearby instead of in the back.  Have a stantion that separates the order and pick up lines so they dont blend into one long line.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=320

I love to get the Mac 'N Cheese off the kid's menu (hey, they've never told me I couldn't order it), which is delicious, cheap ($5.50, including a lemonade!) and just the right amount of food for me.  Considering how generous the kid's portion is, the adult portion must be huge and waaay too fattening.  It's al dente fusili with a creamy, real melted cheese sauce, not at all like the fakey Kraft or Velveeta type.   When I come here with the BF, we share the full-sized BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad ($14.10, I love the black beans, sweet white corn and jicama) and a BBQ Chicken Pizza ($13.60) with HONEY WHEAT DOUGH! You have to try it, it's amazing.  Don't forget to ask for it, though, otherwise it just comes with the normal crust, which is also good.   Mom likes the Miso Salad ($13.85), which comes with Napa & red cabbage, avocado, cucumbers, daikon, edamame, carrots, scallions, cilantro, won ton strips and miso dressing.  It's really filling!  Probably all that cabbage... She usually adds shrimp for an extra $2.25. Last but not least, I love the spinach artichoke dip.... mmmm.  And if I'm feeling indulgent, I'll get a lemonade to wash it all down. The bread isn't good, but who wants to waste calories on bread when you're at CPK? The take out service is convenient, even if you have to wait a while sometimes.  Call ahead and expect a 15-45 minute wait. I'm sure I've had some bad service experiences here, but I've been coming here for so long that I have a generally good feeling about the service, and I think the food blocks out any negatives.  The only real downside is that everybody else loves coming here too, so there is always a wait a peak hours, and you can't make reservations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=320

Its a tradition from high school that began when we'd go to kahala mall to shop and be too indecisive to decide where to drive for dinner when we got hungry (Kahala doesn't have very many good eating options). My group of friends and I became regulars, always ordering the same thing. To this day I have probably only ordered 4 different things off their menu.  The bottomless flavored iced teas and lemonades are sooo sooo sooo good. I usually get mango or peach iced tea. The spinach artichoke dip is a must for appetizers. I really haven't even considered trying any other appetizer. You can also ask for complimentry bread if you have left over dip and ran out of chips. They also have a new spinach artichoke pizza For entrees I either get the chicken waldorf salad or the grilled vegetable sandwich with caesar salad. Yum yum. And by this time I am too full to eat dessert, even though the waitstaff always asks soooo nicely.

We have a love-hate relationship.  My bf says that I have called the manager so many times that they have a plaque of my photo in the kitchen that says, ""Please take care of Aimee when she is here."" So here goes... You cannot go wrong with pretty much anything to eat & drink at CPK. Sincerely, I love the salads (chopped, cobb, chinese chicken), pastas (most especially my fav brocolli sun dried tomato fucilli), pizzas (u name it, yum!), desserts, and their tart but yummy lemonade. And you can now order online, yup, online and never have to listen to their hold music at all! It's pretty darn awesome. BUT...as of late, here's my woes: super-de-duper slippery floor near the bar - to be truthful, I slipped and almost tasted tile, sometimes the restaurant smells like dirty mop (can u smell it now?!), and lastly I got irritated because they made my simple chopped salad with cabbage or some kind of coleslaw mix. Can't a girl just her simple salad with lettuce? Anyway, to make a long story short, the managers are pretty cool with ""comp""-ing an entree if you just ask.

Their take out also does more orders then CPK ala moana, Pearlridge and waikiki COMBINED. The waits are always pretty long so go earlier then expected to eat and put your name down, then roam around the mall. Also, you can hit up the bar area  (which is free seating) and order food and drinks from there.  My favorites: Chicken piccatta $18- AMAZING! 3 chicken breast, side of pasta with a lemon cream caper sauce. SO ONO! I usually get extra sauce and modify the noodles to fussili noodles. BF favorite: Traditional mac and cheese, add bacon add bolognese (meat sauce) - SO Good and hearty. IF your partner loves pasta, meat, and cheese--order this and they will love you forever! The time I ate here, I had Angelo as my server and he was great! He was attentive, funny, and on his game. You could obviously tell the place was packed and he was busy but he made sure we were having a good time.

Cindy S.,"Honolulu, HI",0,2,,2.0,9/7/2014,"I don't really like writing bad reviews for places; especially not for places that I visit fairly often. The two stars I'm giving is because I really do like the food that California Pizza Kitchen offers. However, my past few visits have been really poor in the service department. I get that they just renovated to add more tables, which seriously cuts down on the wait time, but perhaps they should hire more servers? Or faster servers? Lately it feels like there's just a general oversight with the service, like we have to ask for everything.. All the way down to water refills. Water refills are pretty basic, right?  Today's visit was pretty bad. Bad enough that it compelled me to write this review. Here's what happened: We got there, got our waters, put in drink orders and went to wash our hands. Waited to place our orders for a bit, which.. It's fine, they're busy, I get it. Then we get the appetizers and the lettuce wraps were really great. They came with this really strong tasting ginger sauce, though, that kind of overpowered the dish and nobody really used any of it. Fast forward to where the server is clearing the plates away: I got a saucer of this stuff dumped onto me. A full saucer, since we barely used any of it. The server didn't even notice at first, not until we mentioned it to him. This wasn't a tiny spill, mind you, it was all in my hair and my sweater and pants. Once they realized the mistake they apologized, which to be honest is better service than another restaurant I've been to with the same incident. (I'm seriously a magnet for this, no idea why.) The manager came out to apologize and offered to have my clothes laundered, which was nice of him, but he seemed really aloof.  Sadly, though, even after that happened and the tables around us cleared out, there was no speedier or attentive service. I don't know if the waiter was embarrassed to come back to our table, but we STILL had to ask for refills on water and drinks. It even got to the point that we were clearing our finished dishes to another table to make room on ours. Then when the check came, they hadn't comped or discounted anything. I really hate the ""complain and you shall receive"" mentality that most people have, but seriously. That was something I could have MAJORLY complained about, and I've had soup comped at that location because it was served to me at room temperature, not because I was wearing it. The servers ended up bringing out a towel and club soda for me to wipe down my clothes, and they were nice, but I kind of feel like because I'm quiet and didn't make a scene, (not my style. Plus, I work in retail, so I know what it feels like to be on the receiving end of it), that the manager didn't pursue the whole buttering-up-angry-customer route. Meh. That's pretty much how I felt after this visit: Meh. tldr; Food dropped on me, no comps, had to ask for refills, generally not attentive service = sad Cindy. Sad enough that I might not be visiting this location for a while. :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=400
Chanel G.,"Honolulu, HI",112,53,120,4.0,5/26/2012,"Today my husband and I had a terrible wait on our food. But it is our fault for going to lunch on a Saturday at the mall. Critics, please note the time of that meal into consideration when you pick a place to sit and eat.       After 20 minutes our waitress ( who was very attentive ) broke it to us that our ticket was lost in the kitchen, followed  by the manager with sincere apologies. This my friends is how to handle a customer. The manager informs us that she will comp the appetizer and soon we see all of our food.       Two bites in, the chicken in my sandwich gets kinda gross. Like the wrong color and maybe even a bit old. So I just dissect my sandwhich and end up with a delectable BTL with Avacado . No prob. I let the waitress know to check the chicken in the back but the rest of our meal was good . Our Check comes and it's 10$....                   California Pizza Kitchen has a few misses here and there but over all thier number one priority is customer service. By no means was I trying to get a free meal ( almost free ). Really, I was stoked on my modified BTL.

Kyla W.,"Honolulu, HI",14,73,217,3.0,8/20/2014,"I would give this place 3.5 stars. For the food I would give it 4 stars, the cream cheese fettuccine and the salad was good. Those two are always my favorite at CPK. However, on the service side I need to rate it a little low. When we order drink, my server was nice enough to tell me that my drink doesn't have refill, so if I want to change to the ice tea or fountain drinks that does refill. So I change to a peach ice tea, it was not bad, the peach flavor is strong. While we eating, our server don't check on us a lot, and she didn't bring us the bread before our food came out. Then she came to our table with ice tea refill, I was puzzled and asked if it was next table, she said no, is the refill, and I said we didn't ask for the refill, then she replied, I already made the refill! Her attitude sounds like we should thank her for the drinks refill even though we didn't ask her to. She is a bit angry when she put down the drinks. I don't usually go Kahala Mall a lot, so I don't think I will come to this place often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=400

Now they do offer it either peppered or blackened cajun style. I chose the cajun which was cooked to perfection. Amazingly tender yet flaky, lightly crispy on the outside and the spices were oh so tasty. The salmon was accompanied with creamy lemon-caper spaghetti and grilled asparagus which were a perfect balance.  Service was excellent, very friendly waitress and right on queue with everything.

We ordered the tricolore pizza which is a thin crust pizza with a salad on top.  The pizza crust is crunchy but not fresh and way too chewy.  They just had a tiny mound of salad on top and when spread out didn't even cover the pizza.  We mentioned this to the waiter and he apologized and got us more salad (nice save).  The salad usually has a balsamic vinegarette  dressing but for some season it was something else.  The waiter was really nice but the food was so so this visit.  My 9 year old daughter even said ""it is called California Pizza Kitchen"" but the pizzas aren't very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=400

Jason C.,"Honolulu, HI",116,192,37,4.0,4/4/2011,"The service is always friendly and attentive but on our last visit, we experienced amazing service. My young son ordered the Fusilli Alfredo but after eating a few bites commented to us that he wanted more sauce. Soon after that, someone who wasn't our server brought a small bowl of Alfredo sauce to our table; we were so surprised we didn't know what to say! Evidently he was close by and heard my son and took it upon himself to make him happy!  My favorites are the Wild Mushroom and Jamaican Jerk Chicken pizzas. The roasting of the mushrooms concentrates their flavor and elevates the pizza. The Jamaican pizza is studded with uber delicious applewood smoked bacon and is perfect with the sweet roasted peppers and spiciness from the jerk seasoning and Caribbean sauce.  I'm not a fan of chains, but CPK is an easy exception. The ingredients are fresh and the flavors pop. I also like how they regularly bring in a few new items to keep the menu from getting stale. It's the combination of an interesting menu, fair prices, and great service that keeps CPK in our rotation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=400
Krissy F.,"Honolulu, HI",11,47,301,4.0,3/4/2014,"Yum!!!! This place is casual and still delicious! My husband and I love to get pizzas from here to go when we are in a hurry. You can sit down or order to carry out! It's so much better than that crap pizza from dominos, papa johns, cicis, little cesars, or Pizza Hut! I feel like the products used on their pizzas here are much better than other places also! They also offer much more unique pizzas you can see on their menu different ones to fit your taste buds my favorite is the artichoke with Alfredo sauce, chicken, garlic, and Alfredo hearts! So delicious but it will definitely make your breath smell like garlic for a few days lol ;) Helps keep the vampires away! Now the Cesar salad here is AWESOME! I recommend it with the grilled chicken or salmon if you like salmon and want a healthier option! Cesar salad is by far my favorite and their croutons are homemade which makes their Cesar salad over the top! I could eat it everyday if I could! I cannot wait to try more of their different pizzas during my time on the island! My husband had their arugula quinoa salad and he couldn't stop raving about it! I cannot vouch for it because I didn't try it, but he was a major fan! Also, they do sell the California pizza kitchen brand pizzas at the grocery store if you want to make the pizza at home yourself. I actually made one last night and it was really good!! Reasonably priced too! Cheaper than the restaurant! It was the spinach, Alfredo, cheese one on thin crust in the frozen section! Yum!!!

There are times when I go for their classic pizzas, but to tell you the truth, I like their pasta menu more :-) The food's pretty good, but again, CPK can get a little too chaotic somtimes, so that's my only bad comment.

This location is one of my favorite CPKs simply because they have great service.  Although the wait time is usually long here (30-40mins sometimes even an hr) especially on weekends and holidays, they still are efficient and get us in and out pretty fast.  The waiters/waitresses are really on top of it and they always take care of my order correctly or they fix it quickly (I've never really had a problem with them messing up my orders).  The service is usually very friendly as well. Today (2/20/11) we did have to wait awhile though.  We waited for a little bit for a table (we were told 30-35mins) but luckily we spotted 2 seats open on the counter, which we quickly swooped in and took.  SCORE!! It cut our wait time in half!  We did however end up waiting 10-15 mins before our waiter was able to get to us, serve us water and take our order.  We waited even longer for our food come!  Man, they were really busy though, but you definitely know you've been shafted when the people who sat down next you 10 mins after you did, ordered 10 mins after you ordered and got their food before you!    We were sort of in a rush too, because we had to head to the airport to pick up someone--talk about time crunch!  Once our food arrived, we quickly started inhaling it as fast as we could and our waiter knew we had to leave ASAP, thus he quickly pulled up our check and handed it too us in no time.  Man, what a surprise to see that our check amount total = $0.00!!  COMP MEAL!?  What do you know after all?  CKP pulls through once again!

Nicole K.,"Waipahu, HI",590,573,753,4.0,10/3/2010,"We should have known better than to try and walk in to CPK on a Saturday night.  The hostess told us it would be a 45 minute to an hour wait.  Me, being lazy, didn't want to find somewhere else to eat.  However, our wait was only 20 minutes.   I always get the chinese chicken salad, but this last time i opted for the pesto penne with chicken.  Very good.  I liked the sun dried tomatoes on top, and they had  A LOT of flavor.   Our waiter was very nice, and he made sure our drinks were refilled.  I feel like they really updated their dessert menu.  I was too full for dessert, but my friends got the souffle.  ""Someone must have yelled in the back because it deflated"" HAHA.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=360
Wendy I.,"Honolulu, HI",74,60,75,4.0,7/18/2011,It's CPK! I love their tortilla spring rolls and their bread. I'm not much of a pizza fan.

Steph J.,"Irvine, CA",264,262,48,4.0,3/10/2011,"The very first CPK I ate at was in California, back in 1996.  I almost feel like I should have claim to it coming to Hawaii because I raved about it so much back then, when all you really had to go by how good a restaurant was word of mouth.   I'm not a huge salad eater.  For me to eat a salad as a meal is a pretty rare occurrence.  So when I say that the Waldorf Salad with Dijon Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing is delicious, you should know that I don't say it lightly.  When I say that I'm a big eater, you should also know that I don't exaggerate.  I really can eat.  But for me to order a salad and a half an order at that?!  There must be an anomaly with this place!  But not only are their salads good, so is their pasta, their soups and even their salmon.  I bet you didn't know they had salmon on their menu, did you?  They have a specialty dishes area on the menu and if my memory serves me correctly, it's between the pizza and the sandwiches.   There is a line here at times so having to wait sucks a bit but if you can find seats on the counter, go snag some.  But just as a courtesy tip, if it looks like there were people waiting for some counter seats before you, don't be a dick and crowd around the people that are trying to eat their meal in peace.  #1, you weren't there first.  #2, if you do that, I will remember you and cough as I stalk you to finish your meal.  Heh heh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=360

Once we got in, the service was good. I had my bbq chicken chopped salad, my friend had the garlic shrimp special and we shared the the works pizza. Everything was flavorful. Although it appeared busy our waiter checked up on us and refilled our glasses with ice tea. My desert, the red velvet cake with vanilla ice cream put it over the top. My friend had the children's hot fudge sundae.  The only reason for the four was the waiter had to be reminded about our straws and after we were finished with our meals, we had to flag him that we were interested in dessert and he could take our empty plates away.  Overall, our waiter still did a good job because it was busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=440
David C.,"Honolulu, HI",13,118,28,4.0,10/16/2011,I like that they continue to revise their menu and bring new things to the table. My favorite lately is their small cravings menu.

Kalae P.,"Honolulu, HI",80,80,96,4.0,6/4/2010,"The chains of CPK are unbeatable! Their food tastes pretty much the same at each location (that's a good thing) & service is usually always friendly. From their salads to their pizza, everything has flavor (not home style though) and fills you up no matter what you get (excluding appetizers). My favorite is the Penne Pesto w/ Chicken & Shrimp. A great place for meetings & family dinners. But FYI, the place does get pretty noisey so don't go in wanting a peaceful dinner. The sound somewhat echoes and if you waited in the long 1-2 hour line, then you should hope for some noise and conversation explosions!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=440

If you don't like salty food,you must ask server to go easy on the salt. Lunchtime and dinnertime are very busy, so you must get there early,because you may have to waite about 30 minutes. I recommend you order the large vegetable pizza and the large spagatti. If there are three people in your group, you will pay about $46 including tip. The food I had was pretty good.

James B.,"Henderson, NV",6,25,,4.0,6/17/2010,"Simply said, one of my favorite places to eat, at this specific location.  I will honestly say that I eat @ CPK Kahala, at least 3-4 times a month. You can't go wrong with the food, it's delicious, and the service is awesome, seriously. I've yet to have a bad server at this location, and being that I frequent it as much as I do, I've had quite the array of different personalities, but all of them positive.  I LOVE the BBQ Chopped Chicken Salad, no cilantro, I know, I know, you love it, I hate it. Extra bbq sauce & ranch dressing on the side, and yes, you do have to squeeze lime on top of the salad, it's not just there for decoration. Other favorites include, the Jamaican jerk pizza, crab cakes, spinach artichoke dip, Waldorf salad (ask for extra candied walnuts! Yum!), hummus. I think I'm getting hungry, my mouth is starting to salivate.  The new small cravings are hit & miss, the corn tamale ravioli's are deelish, but the deep fried artichoke hearts? Why bother? They are so tiny and so few, you just can't enjoy them. My recommendation would be to increase the quantity, not the price, and don't fry them so long. I've tried them twice and it always tastes kinda burnt. Keep the dipping sauce, don't change a thing with that,  I hated Red Velvet Cake...until I tried theirs. ^_^ I'm doing the happy food dance in my mind. I love that it is so dense, but yet still seems light and oh so moist, then it's slathered up with that cream cheese frosting...MmMmMm! And by golly, there's a new kid in town, on my last visit about a week ago, I noticed a new addition to their dessert menu...Butter Cake!!! Though I couldn't try it then as my waistband simply wouldn't give any more, I will definitely partake in it's buttery goodness upon my next visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=440
Aaron K.,"Kailua, HI",317,57,31,4.0,6/28/2011,"Food: 4/5 Price: 4/5 Service: 4.5/5 Organization: 5/5 Layout: 5/5 Atmosphere: 5/5 Mad props to Kurt and the rest of the crew at Kahala Mall CPK! The service and teamwork was spectacular to see. Kurt was definitely busy running around the entire bar area where my mom and I were seated but if he ended up being busy, one of his fellow team members was willing and able to bring us our food or even make sure everything was okay. Not much for conversations since the place was definitely bustling, but they got the job done efficiently, effectively, and with a smile. Just a few minor missteps here and there. Overall, a marvelous performance! The layout is one of the nicest I have seen yet for a CPK. While there isn't an area to eat outside, there was ample lighting when my mom and I went for lunch this past weekend. The atmosphere was bright and jovial and reflected on the staff as well as the clients. People were being seated, served, and seen to in such a friendly fashion that it made the food taste even better! The food at CPK is decent. I'm not going to say the best there is because I know there are a few places out there that really go an extra length but this location came darn close to it! My mom and I ordered the half order of Original BBQ Chicken Chopped ($8.99, $12.49 for a full order) and Baja Fish Tacos ($11.99). The Original BBQ Chicken Chopped has chopped lettuce, black beans, sweet corn, jicama, cilantro, basil, crispy corn tortilla strips and Monterey Jack cheese tossed together in an herb ranch dressing. Topped with chopped BBQ chicken breast, diced tomatoes and green onions, though we had it without the cilantro and green onions. The chicken was nice and soft and literally seemed to melt in my mouth. The vegetables were crispy and the best part was that the salad was not drenched in the dressing. There was enough to coat it lightly and add flavor without leaving a giant mess on the plate. The Baja Fish Tacos were also decent. While a little drenched in dressing, they were still flavorful. There were two tacos that my mom and I split that had sauteed Mahi Mahi, shredded cabbage and ranchito sauce. The cabbage was crispy and fresh and the Mahi Mahi seemed seasoned as well. Overall very pleasing to the palate. The tacos came with blue and white corn tortilla chips with roasted tomato salsa. The chips were crunchy yet soft and the salsa (which contained onions and cilantro) was amazing! It wasn't too watery and just had the right mix of everything for the right amount of spice. Also ordered the Raspberry Iced Tea ($2.99). While it was a little watery and not to my liking of sweetness, one packet of sugar fixed that right away. The bread was also amazingly soft and yummy! Soft bread = win!!!! Overall, I can't wait to go back to this CPK to try more amazing dishes!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=440

Located in Kahala Mall, it is forever crowded and a good, safe place for parties big or small. You know what to expect and you get it. I haven't met a pizza there I haven't liked.   I have to commend the CPK crew for their good service. The other night I went and ordered the honey wheat option with my pizza. I guess there was a mix-up and they brought me a whole pizza with the regular dough, told me I could eat some of it (if I wanted) and then they would bring the other one in 7 minutes and I could wrap this one up to take it home, since it was their mistake. They really stepped it up even if I wasn't really complaining and would have survived anyways. But they took that extra effort to remedy the situation and I appreciated it. So I got two pizzas for one, and I went out of the restaurant that much more satisfied.

Emiko T.,"New York, NY",279,329,100,3.0,12/16/2010,"So while CPK is usually on top of their food game, maybe they drop the ball when it comes to serving take-out customers? I'm doing a 3 star review mostly to get the attention of perhaps a conscientious CPK manager at Kahala Mall (but alas, hardly any chain restaurant manager would ever take a look at us lowly Yelpers...) Now first the customer service was amazing. The hostess/take-out server was very nice and helpful and my food was definitely on schedule. I ordered the thin-crust pesto chicken pizza. My dilemma is this: If my food came out as promised 20 minutes later, why was it room temperature?? I was expecting (like the normal human being) to be greeted with a listening melting excess of cheese and for steam to hit my face when I opened the box. But I was met with lukewarm, somewhat sogginess. Don't get me wrong, I still ate it, but by the time the third slice came around I was definitely a little sad that it had to turn out this way. It was one of two things: the pizza was ready on time but wasn't picked up by the to-go people quickly enough (and by quickly I mean within the next 15 minutes...) OR the pizza wasn't even completely heated through or made from scratch and thus they served me a halfway completed pizza. Sigh. I think it just upsets me mostly because this pizza was $13. For that much money it better come out piping hot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=440

Ashley J.,"Honolulu, HI",0,4,,4.0,4/14/2012,"I LOVE CPK. The spinach and artichoke dip is by far the best (try it with pita bread), and no other restaurant comes close to concocting a recipe as good.  This location is the #1 in the country, so the wait times can get very long, especially on the weekends and holidays. They do not do call aheads or reservations, so I would suggest coming early if you have a specific time you'd like to eat. With party's of four or more, this is a must.  I have a fav. server, who I always request. He gave me an inside scoop that things are changing because CPK was bought by a Corporation. Staff was cut in every area. When the restaurant is swamped, food may take longer to come out too. Less kitchen staff=longer wait on food.

The Miso Salad with crab & shrimp is incredible.  The salmon dish with the side of pasta and asparagus is equally tasty.  Finally, the Chicken Milanese is a fantastic option.  If you want pizza that hasn't changed in a decade, sure go for it... but don't complain that it doesn't blow your mind.

The prices at CPK are very reasonable as well.  Little secret if you are ordering drinks, you can make any drink a double for a buck more!  Damn thats good, might only be at the bar though.  I am not a sweet drink fan, usually go for the bloody which they do well, but they have this cherry lime spritzer(?) that is amazing, definitely recommend trying it. My only complaint with the service is that I was splitting a salad with a friend, I let the server know that when I ordered, and they didn't split it for me in the kitchen.  Minor detail but cost them the fifth star.  Still definitely one of my go to spots for affordable super good food and drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=380

The first thing the waitress said to us was, ""Do you want a menu?"" Uh, yes. This is the first time I've been asked that upon being seated.  We were happily digging into our dessert when my friend found a piece of lettuce in hers. She let the waitress know. The explanation? The salad station is next to the dessert station, and the restaurant would ""take care"" of it This information was delivered without even a hint of apology or concern. We had to guess that ""take care"" of things meant they would take the charge off the bill, as she didn't explain. While I appreciate that she didn't have to pay for it, we both would have preferred that they offer to make her a new one/offer her a different dessert. Yeah, at least it wasn't a bug, but finding that piece of lettuce made her lose her appetite for dessert and she ended up sitting there while I worked on mine. My friend spoke to the manager, and he seemed to think taking the dessert off the bill was sufficient.

It was a Thursday night and a large crowd was outside waiting to be seated and we were ready to wait as well, but was taken aback by how rude the hostess was to us. She told the party of 4 in front of us the wait time would be 30 minutes then when we put our name down for 5, the wait jumped up to 1 hour. We watched as others also put their names down and overheard shorter wait times for similar sized parties. When my husband inquired about the wait time, the young high-school aged hostess who had been rude to us earlier could not offer an explanation. So we moved our dinner to Chili's where we were seated very quickly and were treated well by a friendly staff.

When I have dinner here with my mom, I again have a default order.  Half BBQ chicken chopped salad and the Santa Fe pizza.  See my CPK Ala Moana review for my thoughts on the salad, but the Santa Fe pizza is also very good.  The Santa Fe pizza is like eating a salad in a pizza form, but with fresh ingredients like the guacamole, sour cream and the tomatoes, make the pizza so good.

Classic favorites like BBQ chicken pizza, hummus, chinese chicken salad, and jumbalaya are winners and they continue to introduce new dishes...new favorite are there fish tacos...I never thought I'd eat fish tacos at CPK but these made with Mahi Mahi are quite excellent. Also, a great place to take your kids...kids menu comes with crayons to keep those rascal kids occupied...well at least hopefully!

Years and years ago, I joked with a friend about designer pizza. We tickled each other's funny bones by dreaming up warped combinations, and I came up with an abomination: Chinese pizza. Then, a few years after that, CPK comes up with--Chinese pizza (they call it something else--Wonton pizza? Peking Duck pizza?--I don't think it's on the menu anymore). Um, wow! It was actually really good. Other designer pizzas here are also yummy. I'm also a fan of their appetizers, like the Tuscan bean soup, Tuscan hummus, and especially the Spinach Artichoke Dip (nobody doesn't love CPK's Spinach Artichoke Dip!). Oh, and the desserts are just the right way to finish gorging yourself, if you still have room and the constitution of Mr. Creosote. Always busy, always crowded. What does that tell you?

Colleen L.,"West Los Angeles, CA",565,601,1889,4.0,7/19/2011,"Here for a 8 y/o boy's birthday party. There were 10 of us, which even though we had reservations, we were told we had to wait 60-90 minutes. This CPK is busy, busy, busy.  Luckily I had a lot of catching up to do with relatives so the time flew by. We waited outside on the benches. Once we were seated inside, I noticed it was very noisy. Had to strain to carry on a conversation.    I had a cup of smashed pea and barley soup. It was as good as ever. Also had the 1/2 order Thai Crunch salad, with lime-cilantro and spicy peanut dressings on the side. Our waitress was very pleasant. When I told her to hold the chicken, she offered to replace it with avocado! I asked for extra cilantro and it was forgotten. I thought of it momentarily, then forgot to ask our waitress again.  My relatives enjoyed all their pizzas and salads, the birthday boy enjoyed his spinach artichoke dip, cheese pizza and his hot fudge sundae. His hot fudge sundae was the best dessert by the way.  The consensus on the strawberry shortcake that was shared among 10 - the strawberries were not sweet. The united thoughts on the tiramisu - most of it was left on the plate.  All in all, there's something here to suit anybody of any age, entrees, pizzas and salads are hearty fare, consistently good. If you have a big party, be prepared to wait.

I know the wait can be a little torturous, especially after a tiring day of errands and shopping, but there are instances when the time given to you is sometimes cut short by the time your buzzer vibrates.

Jeff O.,"Honolulu, HI",18,8,,1.0,7/26/2013,"(If I could give zero stars.. . Or even negative 2!) You know I don't know why I keep trying to give their takeout a chance..? They NEVER get the order correct,  EVER!  I have reprimanded more temporary hired assistant's w/in the last 3 years than I have since I helped to open this first Kahala CPK back in 1988,90(?) when the menu was larger and thousands of customers came every day, basically the whole Oahu island came! Where we,  back then, got 98% of ALL orders right,  and those we didn't,  we corrected! Where Pantry had to make a warm Spinach salad topped w/ Quail eggs as the garnish and had a caramel or chocolate fudge ice cream sundae where we made the whipped cream! Nowadays the menu is smaller and the pantry, sauté and pizza stations are all smaller.  But it is sad to say that w/in the last few years the food has gotten worst and worst.  It doesn't matter that they try to revamp their menu, try different presentations, try to hire better staff... NONE of it is working! Their cooks don't care the food tastes like a bland uncaring attempt. Remember people aioli is mayonnaise! Presentation doesn't matter because I am only critiquing TakeOut though does include their food! And their order takers/waiters always ASSUME what the customer wants to order! Like they press the picture on the order screen of what they ""think"" they heard, or maybe they were thinking what they want for lunch or what they like to eat, not what the customer is actually ordering!?  I do believe my assistant, that he ordered what he wanted and then what I wanted for lunch. CPK got his selection right since there is no other item w/the words in its name in any other item on the menu. What I wanted is another story. I wanted the original Chopped Salad w/salami yet what I got was the gross bbq chopped chicken salad. (wth happened to the Chinese chicken salad? That was 10x better than this bbq cream salad!!) This salad is atrocious! It's like it was designed by a drunk person w/ no taste buds! Now why would the counter person think what my assistant ordered, the original chopped salad w/ salami,  diced chicken, garbanzo beans, diced tomatoes and their olive oil based dressing somehow could've been mistaken for this bbq cream chicken salad w/ the bland cream dressing, bbq sauce and cardboard chicken. BBQ sauce on lettuce is grossly disgusting then add in a bland cream dressing and now you have something created by a person born w/o taste buds!  I did not want the BBQ Chopped Chicken Salad.  I wanted the Original Chopped Salad w/ salami and diced chicken. This frequent order taking mistake is why I will NEVER dine in. If a restaurant is unable to get the customers order correct for take out,  then there is only a minuscule chance that they'll get it right in a noisy sit down and wait atmosphere. Now the reason I am critical about this critique is that 9 out of 10 times at the take out counter,  they have gotten my order WRONG!! Having to send the order back while standing there and waiting while watching sit down patrons come and go pisses me off! (I have 12+years experience as a cook in places such as CPK all the way up to fine dining Roy's and Wolfgang Steakhouse so can only blame the cooks in the tasteless unseasoned food,  not in the mistaken order).  It's like the workers at CPK just don't care anymore. All they want is a paycheck. That this ""job"" is just a ""give me my tip/paycheck"" job and who cares about the customer,  which is sad because this Kahala store does at least a thousand less per day than when we first opened it!  The reason I am mad at my assistant is because I've always told him that,  ""you MUST check"" your order while you're 'at the window' because we live in an era where customer service has been measured and found wanting. Where young workers just don't care and have no honor or pride in what they do. I was mad because my assistant fell into that category of the careless in this one instance.  9 out of 10 times Kahala CPK will get your order wrong. They have come a long way,  going in the wrong direction and I strongly believe they are now the worst CPK on the island!  My last comment: CPK,  WTH is w/ all these sauces and dressings meant to cover up the ingredients of the dishes? Chicken should taste like chicken but doesn't because when it was cooked, the cook didn't care enough to season it w/a pinch of salt! Disgusted w/ the lack of basic cooking technique,  I will again wait another 3 months before I give this location another chance!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=420

We also finished our complimentary bread and that dish was not taken away from the table at all.. Also, I believed that CPK packed our left overs?

I remembered ordering a pasta dish with sun dried tomatoes and chicken in pesto sauce. Least to say, it was super bland, chicken was soo dry. I only ate the sun dried tomatoes with the pasta to get flavor. I didn't want to be rude and send it back. Our waiter was really slow, got our order drinks wrong and took forever to get our food.

I thought it was a very weird response and i just said it wasn't necessary, i will just order it.  Then she asks me again, ""do you want to try it, I really think you should try it first?"" Now that I think about it maybe I should have tried it first but I love broccoli and I like broccoli soups, so again I said ""no thanks"".  Once we finished ordering and got our food, the waitress walks by our table to check up on us, she said ""oh, wow, you finished it?  I'm surprised you liked it!!"" Again I was a little puzzled and thought that she is entitled to her own opinion but still thought it to be strange.  I got a little irritated but then as usual, shrugged it off.  Then, once we finished eating she brought the dessert menu and said "" Time for dessert!!"" with a big smile.  I had quickly mentioned ""oh, we are stuffed and have no room for dessert"", she quickly walked on by so she probably didn't hear us.  Then, she came back and asked us if we wanted dessert.  Again, we mentioned to her that we didn't want any and she says ""Why?? and we said no thanks, then she says ""why? you can two can just share one? and we reassured her again that we weren't interested and just wanted the check.  She said okay and then last but not least, the weird thing is once she stopped by to give us the check, she came back with the check and another refill soda.  It caught us by surprise because he wasn't completely done with his current one and we were ready to leave.  Overall, it was an interesting experience.  i didn't get to see her name tag but either way I wouldn't have mentioned it here so she doesn't feel embarrassed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=460
Mr Blix E.,"Honolulu, HI",5,30,,2.0,8/4/2007,"On short notice we decided to go to CPK at Kahala Mall.  I never have been a big fan of the place, but sometimes what's in throwing distance ends up being where you go.   So we (my wife and 2 kids) get there and request a booth, it helps to keep them corralled, the host is agreeable and assists in getting us our booth.   We get to the booth and get seated, about 3 minutes after we're seated our waiter comes by apologizes in advance because a) it's busy, and b) he's got an extra table to tend to that's not in his section.  Eventually he wonders aloud why we were even seated in his section, to which we respond ""we requested a booth"".   WTF?  I worked in a restaurant for a week or two, and maybe things have changed, but I was always under the impression that as a waiter your pay was dependent on the volume of tables waited and the quality of your service.  The fact that this donkey didn't want the extra responsibility and the pay associated with it just sort've vexes me.   In the long run I didn't continue my working relationship with the food services community because it was something I didn't like.  If our waiter feels the same he should do the same.  At any rate, business started to pick up after our arrival which left him unable to better quantify his complaint since he had so many more tables to take care of now.   We ordered the usual spinach and artichoke dip.  This is by far one of the few redeeming qualities about this place.  They're consistent in its richness and texture as well as the creaminess of the dip and the flavor.  The other redeeming quality is that they serve Newcastle.   I ordered a new pizza ""The Works"".  It's basically a supreme pizza with pepperoni, sausage, peppers, and onions.  It tastes like a cross between Papa John's and Round Table pizzas version.  Nothing really notable and not exactly worth the time and effort.   My wife ordered a fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and shrimp.  The overall plate looked good, however the taste left something to be desired.  The shrimps were undercooked and the chicken as well.  The plate ended up taking a healthy addition of red pepper flake and Parmesan cheese.   Our waiting time wasn't too bad, however, it can vary, we stopped by there the other night at around 7pm and the expected wait time for a party of 2 was roughly 40 minutes.  There's no way we were going to wait 40 minutes for mediocre food so we went around the corner to the Olive Tree Cafe which has MUCH better food.   Anyway, I'm reminded every time I eat here exactly why I never ate at the California Pizza Kitchen in Chicago when I was in school there, it's not great, it's not memorable, and certainly without an available competitor you'll end up there.  Chicago has much better pizzerias around, maybe a lot more casual, but definitely much tastier.  As for Kaimuki/Kahala there are a couple of pizza places around, some much better, though without the sit-down and the Newcastle on tap, but if you're going to eat in the mall, then I guess this is the place.  If you're not stuck in the mall then go round to the Olive Tree Cafe, if you're just in the mood for pizza I'd definitely stop by Boston's first.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=460

The parking can be very limited during peak times, so its best to come early to avoid not finding parking.  Sometimes, they can't turn the tables fast enough to accommodate the pending customers waiting outside.  This really sucks, but they do have a limited amount of space anyway.

Craig M.,"Honolulu, HI",14,76,209,4.0,11/23/2011,"Not even a week had passed after the wife and I had lunch at California Pizza Kitchen in Ala Moana Center's Ho'okipa Terrace, when we had an opportunity to lunch at their Kahala Mall restaurant. Talk about luck. Because we had their Chinese Chicken Salad and Barbecue Chicken + Applewood Smoked Bacon pizza at Ala Moana, we decided to take a different tack this time. Besides, the wife's mother and brother were with us this time.    We ordered CPK's Original Chicken Chopped Salad, which consisted of sweet corn, black beans, jicama, cilantro, basil, tortilla strips and Monterey jack tossed in a very mild (almost too mild for me) homemade herb ranch dressing. The full-size version of the salad was topped with BBQ chicken, tomatoes and scallions. Plus, we added on avocado for a buck more. I ate some, but didn't partake of my entire one-fourth of the salad; I thought it was pretty mildly flavored and it wasn't quite to my liking. Not bad, but not great either. The others split a Vegetarian with Japanese Eggplant pizza. It's a pretty tasty pizza with mozzarella, baby broccoli, eggplant, corn, red onions, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes and tomato sauce. There was no avocado option, but I did have them make it with a honey-wheat dough (didn't let the family members have a chance to even think about it). Now the pizza was more to my liking than the salad. CPK pizzas are anything but bland, with strong flavors that sing on your tongue. My mouth was performing a symphony with each bite. And, judging by the yummy sounds, and the fact that the entire thing disappeared with nothing left over to take home, everybody else liked it as well. You know what really made it? The sun-dried tomatoes. I love those things. For myself, I ordered their Fish Tacos (sautéed mahimahi, shredded cabbage and ranchito sauce, served with tortilla chips and roasted tomato salsa), taking the avocado add-on. It was a good choice - the mahimahi was a smidgen on the spicy side, which was okay by me.  And, nice guy that I am, I gave the wife a bite, and then gave my second taco to my brother-in-law, 'cause that guy can eat more than I can.  When I had my tiramisu website, CPK Kahala Mall had the highest-rated tiramisu in Hawaii. That's what we had for dessert. The family no longer does the ""What? You're having dessert?"" unbelieving and fake criticism of me. They've learned I order dessert for a reason, and unashamedly partake, assuaging any false guilt they might have because after all, they don't want to waste food and besides, HE'S the one who ordered it, not them. CPK has good tiramisu. I had given them an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. That's pretty good. And that's why I ordered it that day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=300

When they call or buzz you, they tell you to wait at the couches near the open show kitchen. Then about a minute or so later you are taken to your seat.  They seem to have a great flow from the start of the dining experience.  Servers are always well mannered and informed about the specials. My wife and I usually order two of any of the following items. BBQ chicken chop salad, artichoke dip, Southwestern Chicken Pizza or the Tequila chicken fettuccine .  The day we came there we were a little hungry so we ordered the Bowl of soup, Southwestern Chicken Pizza and the tequila chicken fettuccine adding shrimp to that order. We usually get peach iced tea and man do we drink it up.  it's the best tasting iced tea ever. Food comes out very timely. Always looking hot and fresh.  With their show kitchen, the food never comes out cold. once it's plated it's taken to the table.  I think it's great they have a show kitchen and they are so on top of running the food to the tables. Not only do the servers give great service, the managers always seem to make time to stop by no only my table, but almost everyone's table too! Leah was our manager that night and she was very courteous and helpful in making us feel at home!  our server was training that night and both of them did wonderful! I've almost tried everything on the menu and loved almost every single item! they do a great job and hope they stay around for many many more years to service people that love great food! Enjoy everyone!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=300

Cat K.,"Honolulu, HI",65,68,61,2.0,5/19/2012,"This review is strictly for take out.   So I ordered online.  I don't know why I prefer to order my food online rather than speak to an actual person.  Oh wait, maybe because computers don't sass or speak to you like you're an idiot, kind of like one of the gals who was working the take out area when I picked up my order.   I ordered the roasted vegetable salad, without the romaine lettuce because the night before when I ordered the same salad at the Ala Moana CPK, it consisted almost entirely of lettuce and very little roasted vegetables.  I just wanted the roasted vegetables and avocado.  Apparently, I'm an idiot for checking off the online option that specifically says to hold the romaine lettuce.  ""What do you mean you don't want lettuce?!  It's a salad.""  I let her talk me into just taking the lettuce since it's packed separately from the roasted vegetables anyway ""so you can just add as much lettuce as you want to the vegetables.""  What if I just don't want lettuce?  It's not like I asked for a discount for ""no lettuce"". On a side note, I did come with one of those Don't-Open-Thank-You-Cards and received 10% off my order but I did not receive one for this order (I left a 10% tip because I'm still not sure what the etiquette is on take out, so I didn't really save any money).  However, the customer who picked up her pasta order right before me (pasta, sauce & cheese in three separate containers) received a thank you card.  I guess CPK Kahala just wasn't thankful for my particular order tonight.   I was going to let this whole experience slide because it's not like a cockroach ran out from under my food just as I was sticking my fork into it (yes, that really happened at a popular Hawaiian food joint on Kapahulu, and it wasn't Haili's), but I felt bad as I was driving home and you're not supposed to be made to feel bad when you leave a hugely corporate food joint like CPK.  I'm supposed to feel obligated to come back because they gave me yet another secret scratch off Don't-Open-Thank-You-Card, which is why I was patronizing their business for the 4th time in three days in the first place.

Went for lunch today and again, the service was incredibly slow.  The waiter spilled my sister's lemonade on the table and didn't wipe it up until we requested extra napkins (after he left to take another table's order).

My husband and I usually share a chopped salad and then, depending on our appetite -- 1 or 2 pizzas. This week, we found that they redid their menu (!), so the thin crust pesto chicken was gone. Instead, we tried the roasted artichoke and spinach thin crust pizza. It had tons of garlic & was actually really good! We also tried the mushroom pizza (regular crust), which has now become my new favorite! We were stuffed! Took home a little more than half a pizza as leftovers. Another thing we usually get is a veggie pizza with the goat cheese option. (I think it's still on the menu?) The service is usually reasonable - pleasant, cheery, and usually very responsive. It's a very kid-friendly place, and I know several of my friends who bring their families here, too.

My friends and I ate at the Kahala CPK yesterday for a late lunch. We were a party of 5 and were quoted 30 minutes. We didn't mind, after all we were a larger party. The hosts were great! They got us in within 10 minutes of wait time! Then everything goes downhill from there. We sat at our table and must have waited at least 5 minutes for a server to even approach us. When she finally did, NO apology, NO introduction as to what her name was, just a ""Hi..."" By that time we were already ready to order. Drinks: 4 waters and a strawberry lemonade. We ordered our food at the same time. Drinks came a million years later! (Sarcastically speaking of course, but damn!) Food was dropped by other servers who seemed more caring than her. Our server, Carol was her name by the way, didn't drop straws with our water, our cups were dry! She took WAY too long to refill. She was VERY innatentive. By the time we finished my friends needed To-Go boxes. We waited... and waited... and waited. She was no where to be found! I finally had to stand up, go to the back room and ask the manager for boxes. He seemed caught off guard, but I was almost at my last straw waiting. He asked if they were innatentive, I agreed and said our server was just.... I couldn't even find a word to describe her. He offered to take something off our check, but I declined. Reasoning? We didn't mind paying for the food. It was the SERVICE that took a toll on her tip. The check took just as long as the waters and we had to stand up and go to the hoststand to ask for change because again she was no where to be found. Question is: Would I go back? Of course, I love CPK's food. But to go back to Kahala Mall CPK is another question.

The free bread is smaller but the taste is way better than before. Nice and hard crust, really soft and tasty inside. It comes with this olive oil with herbs in it (not sure the details). My personal favorites are the original BBQ chicken pizza and the salad. Such great taste of the BBQ sauce and chicken mixed into these simple recipes. The salad goes really well with avocado and the pizza is really good with honey wheat dough. Recommends!!! The butter cake is amazing!

However, when you walk inside, the place is huge. It extends way back with a lot of seats.  I had lunch here yesterday with the hubby. Everything was great, from the food to the service. We went around 2:30 in the afternoon and the restaurant was busy but not full. We got seated right away. The host was nice and joked around with us. It was raining but he made a joke about looking at the sunny weather through the glass windows. We waited for about 5 minutes before the server came. He apologized right away for the wait, which wasn't a problem because he was busy from what I noticed. For some reason, all their name tags are written in chalk. The first letter of his name was smudged. I only made out the EN, the last letters of his name. It was either Ben, Gen or Ken. He confirmed that his name was Ben. He was awesome, one of the better servers I had in a while. He checked on us frequently, kept the glasses full and cracked a few jokes. What I noticed about this place was that the servers are happy. Everyone in the front of the house was smiling and having fun. I looked at all the servers around me and they were all smiling and joking around with the customers and their co-workers. I've never been to a restaurant where all the servers were genuinely smiling. I eat out quite frequently, at least 3-4 times a week. When we were leaving, at least 4 employees thanked us for visiting. Hmmm, it makes me wonder what management is doing at this place that's keeping their workers happy. Whatever it is, it's working. This was my first time at this location. I usually go to the one at Ala Moana or Pearlridge. This location definitely has the better service. It's not to say that the other locations give bad service, because they don't. They just don't seem to smile and are always just rushing around. The food here also came out relatively fast. I would say 10-15 minutes after we ordered, the entrees were out. I had to get my favorite salad, the Thai Crunch salad with avocado. It was spectacular as always. I've never tasted a better salad. The taste of the food from their different locations are pretty consistent. I order this salad no matter what CPK location I'm at and it always tastes the same. Instead of pizza today, we opted for a pasta. I wanted to try the pesto penne with shrimp and chicken. It was good but I like my flavoring a little stronger. For dessert, we tried the butter cake with ice cream. This dish was oh so good. It's served warm and there's some kind of syrup that's baked into the cake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=140
Creedo R.,"Seattle, WA",4,23,61,4.0,3/1/2016,"We love cpk. Kahala is my favorite location pearlridge is my second favorite.  We eat here quite often.. Maybe once every few months.. and all but once the experience was perfect. (Not bad enough to rant about) Let's start with the beverages. I absolutely LOVE their drinks! My go-to cocktail was the Adobe margarita. It's a spicy margarita served on the rocks with rock salt.  *drOol! I'm pretty critical when it comes to margaritas since so many places make it too damn syrupy with their bottled roses lime juice but either cpk uses a really good brand or it really is squeezed lime, it's a perfectly balanced drink.  I've tried their classic mojitos too and I honestly have to say it's perfect!  Never too sweet and it's just such a pretty drink with fresh muddled mint. I love how the sugar cane adds a natural look to the drink. Besides those two drinks,  I could never stray away enough to try anything else.   I've always been very impressed with their wine list.  It's has always been well known wines with very resonable prices. My all time favorite white wine is the Santa margherita pinot grigio. I swear this wine pairs nicely with so many dishes. It never fails.  I believe a bottle runs about $40 which is shocking since there is barely a markup from grocery store price!  Moving on to the food.. even though I do love their pastas and pizzas, I actually love their appetizers even more.  Our favorite salad is the Arugula quinoa salad.  My husband and I demolish this every.single. time.  Healthy,  light, and delicious.  What more can you ask for in a salad? We've enjoyed their avocado egg rolls,  flat breads,  spinach artichoke dip,  lettuce wraps, etc.. there was nothing that disappointed.  Lastly,  service. The servers we've had have always been so sweet and attentive. Staff always greeted us with smiles and always gave my kids a little extra attention which is always a nice gesture. Managers always made time to stop by our table to check on our dinner experience.  With all that said,  we love cpk specifically kahala and pearlridge.  Btw, they even have a rewards program now,  I believe it's every $100 you spend, you get a bonus $5 off your next visit.  ************* Update,  like I wrote in the tip section,  my new favorite cocktail is their vodka avocado drink.  I think it's called California cooler.  sOo delicious!  Served over ice with a fennel salted rimand garnish with a mint spring!!  And I've convinced myself is a healthy drink cause it's avocados so I can drink up muahaha",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=140

Rachel I.,"Honolulu, HI",231,308,1521,4.0,3/18/2015,"Yelp 100 Review Challenge 2015: 13/100 After receiving a 50$ gift card to CPK, I decided to revisit a CPK since I hadn't dined at one for well over a year. After calling Ala Moana and finding out they had a 50 minute wait and CPK does not take reservations or ""Call-ins"" I was turned off and found myself at Kahala Mall with a 30 minute wait that really turned out to be only 25 minutes! Luckily, this location, too is in mall so it helps to walk around and kill time. Our enthusiastic waiter seated us and wow was he just having a great evening or is he always this happy?! Great service! Keep in mind, I haven't been to a CPK in over a year so I was impressed with the renovations such as their dress attire, the atmosphere and most of all the menu!...which seemed to be more limited than I remember or maybe they changed the layout? Our waiter promptly got us waters and bread for starters. This bread is much better than their previous! Warm with oil dipping sauce, delicious! And we got free seconds. Anyways, I ordered the Garlic pasta w/ Shrimp (4$ add-on) and also ordered the Tiramisu for dessert. The food was, okay. My partner finished all his food and was left a little hungry so I wouldn't say the portions are large but the dessert was a good size for sharing. I really liked the fact that they leave the Parmesan shaker at the table, which allows you to add Parmesan as you eat and to your desire! Our water was always refilled and our waiter checked up on us appropriately! Literally the service makes it 4 stars! Dinner for two came out to 43$ before tip so I pretty much handed over the gift card + cash. It was a good experience so I am glad I had a gift card but CPK is not the top of my list for pasta. Maybe I should try their pizza next time...hence ""pizza kitchen""?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=140

I like that they update their menu with new items.  I tried their Fire-roasted chile relleno and it was delicious.  Seemed kind of small at first but it was satisfying.  My friend had the Quinoa and arugula salad and one of their flat breads.  Both were quite tasty as well.  Something else that seemed new was the complimentary bread they serve, it comes with an olive oil/herb dib instead of just butter.  The service was good as usual, attentive and friendly. I don't live in the area anymore but when I do feel adventurous enough to brave the Kahala Mall crowds and the parking lot jousting, I won't avoid eating at this CPK anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=140

Sheryl G.,"Honolulu, HI",218,431,175,4.0,2/13/2015,"what: genuine california-style cuisine which introduces flavors from around the world!  something good: this is still my favorite cpk location : ) i haven't been here in forever! i recently came back here with my mom because we had some time to kill. it's still the same california pizza kitchen except i noticed there was a lot of young people here (or maybe i'm just getting older haha)!! the menu has changed a bit and i've found some new favorites and i kept some old favorites too! i like the fact that it's a family restaurant where everyone is talking and having fun! the last visit just reignited my love for the salads here, i'll be back soon! something not so good: just like i remember, the wait is pretty long! but only because it's still so popular! something to try: thai crunch salad (11) & sedona tortilla soup (5)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=140
Denby R.,"Kaneohe, HI",167,178,794,5.0,11/28/2014,"Call it nostalgia... Or call it comfort food. California pizza kitchen in general is always a good idea. But this California pizza kitchen has been a major go to place for my family and friends since I was much much younger. they have expanded their dining area in the back, moved into the hallway in the front, and re-did everything that I knew visually about the restaurant... And yet I'll keep going back. Their prices have inflated over the years, as to be expected.  The staffing at CPK is wonderful. Merle has been one of my favorites as long as I can remember, in fact I got a welcoming hug from her the other day when I haven't seen her for a while. There are many familiar faces there which makes this major restaurant chain feel like a local stop for me.  Probably mostly because it is a chain, that the food is very consistent. You know exactly what you're getting when you order, and if it does not meet your standards, they will replace it and take care of it and make sure that you leave full and happy. Our favorites there include: the spinach artichoke dip (of course) which has been copied over and over and over but never made as good, the margarita pizza (sometimes I like to add mushrooms, But most of the time I like the simplicity of it), and then anyone of their desserts will do just fine. Most of their pizzas are pretty spot on, although we do miss some of our old favorites like the rosemary chicken potato, the original Peking duck, but we have let our tastes adjust to the ever-changing menu. Just don't forget to bring us a bottle of cholula.  Whenever my best friends or I needed a place to meet up and have a deep conversation (especially when we were living with her parents back in the day) this was our place. Oh, if these walls could talk.  Always two thumbs up and at the top of my list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=140
Darius C.,"Honolulu, HI",78,7,2,5.0,1/15/2016,"This CPK is awesome! Tonight our server was Brittany and she was amazing. From beginning to end, our dining experience was perfect. I dined in at this location on a busy Friday night. We had a party of seven and we were initially quoted at 1 1/2hrs to 2hrs before we were seated. Realistically, we were sat well within 45mins which was a great start. Brittany immediately welcomed us and was extremely hospitable. Her positivity lasted throughout the whole night even though it was ridiculously busy. I must admit, our party also made a lot of requests from Brittany but she was surprisingly very patient with us. Bravo Brittany! We appreciated your immaculate service!  Food wise, I got my usual spinach and artichoke chicken pizza which was perfect on the thin crust it came on. I especially enjoyed the crispiness of the crust. And you can never go wrong with their spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer and their butter cake for dessert! Perfect combo.  We will definitely be back at this location soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=140
Joy N.,"Honolulu, HI",343,215,78,4.0,12/2/2014,"Kahala CPK is the best location on Oahu.  I've visited all the locations here and I find that the food and service is very consistent at Kahala.   This CPK is located in the Macy's wing and there's parking right outside the doors, which makes it easy to do take out as well.  They also just renovated so it's much larger now! A few tips/advice for this location: -This CPK is extremely busy!!! I know they all do quite well, but this location always seems to be busiest.  Come early to put your name in for your table (esp for dinner) and then go walk around the mall while you wait. -Give yourself time for take-out orders as well and call ahead. -Order the pasta!  Of all the CPK locations, their garlic cream fettuccine tastes the best here and never disappoints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=140
Enjay 8.,"Honolulu, HI",0,6,,5.0,9/9/2016,"Haven't been to CPK for awhile, they always seem so busy, just like the other night. Wait was about 30 mins, the seating wasn't in the greatest spot. Food was good as always, but I gave it 5 stars because of our server. Merle was awesome. She was on top of everything, beyond what I would consider normal service on such a busy night. Great service always makes the wait worth it and the meal more enjoyable. I am more willing to go even when it seems busy...just need to find out Merle's schedule.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=140

Ellen L.,"Honolulu, HI",164,37,8,1.0,10/11/2015,"This review is for our restaurant experience on 10/12/15 around 2pm. We were seated instantly when we arrived which is a good thing.  However, it started going down hill from there. It took us 5 minutes to get seated because we have a baby with us. Spent another 15-20 minutes feeding the baby. During that time 3-4 workers walked passed us servicing tables around us. We couldn't flag down anyone to help us. Yet the other tables around us, who were seated after us got their drink orders and appetizer. I've tried flagging down the server without making a scene only to be ignored. Ok I understand we might not be your table but at least acknowledge us and let us know you'll get us our server.  I know my friend would not sit well with this type of service so I suggested going elsewhere without telling her why.  We've both worked in food industry and KNOW this type of work ethic is not acceptable. I knew I was being ignored because I've made eye contact with the waitress. After the third attempt I got up and left.  Yes, I was patient for so long because I understand restaurant industry is stressful but in no way is that type of service acceptable anywhere. We even considered requesting to be seated elsewhere but decided we want to spend our money somewhere else instead.  Sitting at a table for 30 minutes no server, no water, and being ignored. I'll spend my money elsewhere. I normally tip 20-30% regardless of service so that's a loss for them not me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=140
Mike O.,"Honolulu, HI",1577,454,2210,5.0,6/12/2013,"Going for early dinner is a must unless you take out, like to wait long or are lucky enough to get a bar seat. UPGRADED FREE BREAD.  WARMMMMM and tasty olive oil herb dip. Other than that did venture too far from my normal garlic cream pasta. There was a new fresh berry and cream dessert we ate that was really yummy. What with the Levi's?  Pizza dough on iphone app is really easy to use.  Just check in and it spits out a 3 digit code you give to your server.  $5 for every $100 you spend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=140
Jerry E.,"Honolulu, HI",11,274,1172,4.0,7/7/2015,"Great place for meals, especially Pizza. I had mushroom pizza on previous visit, so this time I tried mushroom, pepperoni, and sausage pizza. It was pretty good; however, it was on the salty side, probably not good for people who are on low salt diet. Their services were outstanding and prices affordable.  I love the way they refill ice tea by bringing out a new glass, not using a pitcher. This is one of my kind of places for pizza!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=140
Lea K.,"Kaka'ako, Honolulu, HI",374,6,12,5.0,6/24/2016,"Even though this place was super busy at 8pm at night, we were sat within 15 mins. Staff is very attentive to small things and quick to refill drinks and bring bread while we waited. It was the first time that I ordered the fire grilled ribeye from here took a little long than my friends dishes which was fine. When it came to the table it was slightly off from what I ordered but I was ok with that. The staff was so attentive to the time and cook of the steak that they caught their own error with out even having anything said from us. A manager quickly came and apologized and ended up helping to resolve it by giving us a dessert. It was completely unexpected and I was grateful that they were so attentive even though they were extremely busy. I appreciate the fact that it was all hands on deck and that you could clearly see that they work as a team. Awesome experience and food provided.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=140
Coreen L.,"Honolulu, HI",269,376,30,5.0,10/27/2014,"What? Really? I can't believe I've never written a review for one of my favorites CPK! Good grief, talk about brain fart.... CPK is probably one of the very few spots, that is consistently great every time you visit. Sure there is often a bit of a wait, unless you're lucky, but once you're seated you are in the zone. The CPK crew always, always, always seem to have their game faces on which is fantastic because they bring it -- customer service, friendliness, and happiness all the time! You really get the team effort vibe from the crew.  From appetizers, salads, pizza and pasta -- CPK has a huge variety and since this is my first review but surely not my first visit, I can say I've tried a bunch of different items on the menu. All of them are good! Crazy, right? My favorites include: spinach dip with blue chips, lettuce wraps, grilled veggie or original chopped salad, and tortilla soup (add a dash of hot sauce)! The regular pizza is good too, but I love those thin crusted pizzas which is like yummy goodness on a cracker thin crust. I enjoy the pasta options too although I can't say I have a favorite.   Whatever you choose, be SURE you leave some room for dessert because you'll be seeing them pass your table throughout your meal and you'll be drooling for something sweet like the key lime pie, butter cake and oh, salted caramel pudding!  And of course, how could I possibly forget the cocktails!? Goodness, CPK has almost any type of refreshment you could want - a huge selection of wine, beers, interesting cocktails and more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=140
