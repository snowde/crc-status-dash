Michelle I.,"Burlingame, CA",4,12,58,4.0,8/14/2015,Thought it was real good pizza especially considering it was at an airport. Pricy though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4?start=20
Jason W.,"Suwanee, GA",66,104,62,2.0,5/7/2016,Could definitely use some help. Had their breakfast sandwich and their bread was definitely not fresh. Was chewy as if it had been a few days old. Not very happy with what I ate...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4?start=20
Kim N.,"South Bay, CA",2945,9798,55713,4.0,11/15/2013,"The problem with running out the door to get to your flight, go through security, check in and all that shit is you dont have time to eat. So right before getting on a five our flight back home I had to weigh my options. Ahh CPK. First thing the person does is hand me a menu but it's all in Japanese. Oops they hand me the correct one right after. So crazy the level of Japanese based tourism here. Just got a simple pepperoni after having many days of Hawaiian specific meals, which were great, but I needed to change it up. For 15 minutes till boarding and starving, this place will do!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4?start=20
Michelle B.,"San Diego, CA",50,171,742,2.0,4/10/2015,I guess it's because it's located at the airport you can't expect great quality. I was disappointed with the taste and I'm shocked you have to ask for plates when you requested to eat there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4?start=20
Andrew P.,"Bellevue, WA",1,5,1,1.0,2/11/2015,"Worst pizza in a long time, tastes like frozen pizza from the supermarket. For similar prices PGA Tour restaurant nearby has much better food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4?start=20
Kelly T.,"Honolulu, HI",23,101,10,3.0,5/18/2014,Best quick/ semi-healthy meal at the airport. On the international side of the airport but worth the trek because it's in the same area as Pinkberry!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4?start=20
Tasha H.,"Portland, OR",130,259,343,3.0,12/12/2012,"Girls were so into their conversation with one another...  Frozen pizza? what.. and OVERPRICED for the size it was like $13 for a since person size, I even asked they said oh its plenty for two.. now come on .. its four MINI slices.. if your hungry after being at an airport for hours.. its a good snack size. but lower the price..   i was disappointed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4?start=20
risk E.,"Honolulu, HI",22,45,29,3.0,3/6/2014,"You can only go to this one if your flying. They don't have pastas; they only serve pizzas. The pizza don't taste like regular cpk pizzas, but it's not bad",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4?start=20
Connie W.,"Honolulu, HI",73,195,86,2.0,12/28/2010,"After breezing through security at HNL, I had only one thing on my mind (dinner!) and a choice to make: Burger King or California Pizza Kitchen. I went with the latter, figuring I'd get more bang for my buck.  Wrong choice. I paid $12 for an individual sized pizza with a scattering of vegetables and onions that weren't even fully cooked. Hello, onion breath! I instantly felt bad for the passenger sitting next to me on our 7 hour flight, and would have done him the favor of not speaking had he not been so cute. All this could have been overlooked, it's airport food after all, had it not taken 25 minutes for my not-so gourmet pizza to be ready. I couldn't figure out why there was only one person manning the register AND making the pizzas while 2-3 other staff hung out in the back. That's 25 minutes of duty-free shopping that I can't get back. Next time, I'm going for Burger King.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4?start=20
Michael M.,"San Diego, CA",27,48,76,4.0,11/20/2010,"We had the pre-made roasted turkey and chicken pesto sandwiches, and while a bit overpriced at 10 bucks a piece, they sure hit the spot! There was a little line for the register that moved quickly and the lady was very cheerful as we completed our transaction, so this is an all-around good bet if you need a bite before your flight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4?start=20
REBEKAH H.,"Alexandria, VA",46,30,38,4.0,7/23/2011,"If it is between eating the very expensive food on the airplane and juggling bags of food and carry-ons, I'll gladly take the juggling!  I love CPK's chopped salad, I've even had the flight attendants stop and ask where I got it when I break it open mid-flight.  CPK's food is light too, so it doesn't sit in your belly like some of the other food at the airport.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4?start=20
Kevin B.,"Dakota, MN",18,34,,5.0,3/13/2012,"Great value for an airport restaurant. On a layover, had prime rib and chicken with three fantastic sides. $11.99--how could you not like this? The plate was bulging with food. Ate breakfast there the next morning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4?start=20
Randy D.,"San Francisco, CA",16,178,217,4.0,3/26/2011,"Of all the places I have ever eaten at here at the HNL International Airport, I've always found CPK to offer consistantly good food.  I'm usually in a hurry, but I always find the staff helpful and accommodating, the service speedy, and the pizza very good!  Although I don't eat chicken, I have determined that my favorite pizza here is the Thai Chicken (ordered with no chicken, of course).  While I cannot say that this is the best airport food in the world, I can tell you that CPK is my choice for a good, fast meal at HNL!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4?start=20
Kenneth N.,"Richmond, Canada",2248,6665,9584,3.0,9/12/2017,"Very solid 3.85 for me, when you have a CPK inside airport instead of me in Cali.... Ordered Hawaiian, lots toppings. Appreciated workers wearing white gloves. Inside food court, left side.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4
Robert W.,"Milpitas, CA",0,4,,3.0,12/26/2017,Pizza is good but the portions are small for the price (typical airport restaurants).  My kids were still hungry after the pizza and sandwich.  My older son had the pepperoni mushroom sausage pizza and the younger one had the pesto chicken sandwich and they both liked the food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4
Mike M.,"Belmont, CA",110,451,909,5.0,11/21/2017,"If your craving pizza like I was, this is the place to go.  I tried the margarita and pepperoni; both were REALLY good and worth the $29. Note: these are personal sized pizzas at 8"" in diameter and will take 10 minutes to make.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4
Remi M.,"Honolulu, HI",27,216,745,3.0,5/15/2017,"This airport CPK does not accept CPK gift cards since it's contracted out to HMS Host. They do take other forms of major credit cards though. I wanted something light for pre-flight so I got the Caesar Salad. The food court area is very small with limited seating. Had to walk around the terminal a bit until an open table was found. Next time I may just mosey to the food court with the ""other Burger King"" [Did you know this airport has 2 Burger Kings?] since I noticed a lot of empty tables over there. It would be cool if this CPK offered some type of pasta dish. The Pizza Hut Express inside Target offers pasta so not sure why it would be difficult to do it here. Oh well. I can dream.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4
Kathryn M.,"Chesapeake, VA",373,487,1934,4.0,1/22/2017,I wanted pizza and this was the only place pizza was sold inside the Honolulu airport. I have never ordered a pizza at CPK before ( I always order seafood or pasta). They had about 8 specialty pizzas starting at $13 to about $15. I thought this was a bit expensive but I got it anyway. My sausage mushroom pizza was on point! The only thing that kept this place from receiving 5 stars was the fact that they didn't offer pasta.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4
Keith K.,"Kapolei, HI",5,231,31,4.0,10/9/2017,"CPK at the airport is a little pricey , but I really like their chicken barbecue pizza.  This place is in the food court and usually has a short line, but I've always had my food in 5-10 mins from ordering.  Pretty good stuff...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4
Nancy J.,"Kailua, HI",14,18,24,1.0,8/14/2017,"I can't leave a review that is worthy of any star reviews, but the sake of posting.  My daughter was traveling with three small children and just wanted to feed them before they got on their flight.  She wanted to order, but the counter person, ""Rita"" instead of taking her order was suggesting sandwiches she didn't want.  Because she said no, ""Rita"" became very rude, slamming refrigerator door, giving an attitude the whole time my daughter was trying to give her order.  Once payment was due, ""Rita"" wouldn't take the gift card and didn't state why.  Then wouldn't accept her credit card without ID.  I know these are all proper cash handling procedures, BUT there are better ways to handle these situations.  In the frustration, my daughter asked for her credit card back and stated she is taking her business somewhere else, where the customer service is valued. ""Rita"" needs more CUSTOMER SERVICE training.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4
Ophelia S.,"Boston, MA",0,76,,3.0,8/11/2017,"For airport food, this really wasn't bad. The pizza was thin, but pretty decent in taste overall so there's nothing to complain about here. The service was okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4
Yvette A.,"Encinitas, CA",76,172,61,3.0,3/22/2017,I know it's airport food so you should t expect too much but this was bad. The crust was gooey the toppings were average for a vegetarian pizza and it had hardly no cheese or flavor. It also takes awhile for the food I should have ordered a sandwich.. Stay away from the pizza...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4
Maria G.,"Virginia Beach, VA",357,508,1835,1.0,1/29/2016,"I like California Pizza Kitchen, I really do. So, when I saw CPK as a food option at this airport I was happy.  We always get the same pizza for CPK no matter what location we visit, the pepperoni  & sausage with half mushrooms. Hubby eats the meat side and I eat the mushroom side but when we got the pizza they forgot the mushroom, now I'm sad. But when hubby picked up the pizza grease just dripped like a leaky faucet, now he's sad. Never had this pizza greasy like this. Needless to say, we did not eat the pizza at all. We was getting ready to take a 10 hour flight and who knows what this greasy pizza would have done to our stomach way up in the air!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4
Brent K.,"Sioux Falls, SD",183,40,24,1.0,6/14/2017,"I asked an employee ""What's in 'The Works?'""  He replied, We don't have it.  All we've got is pepperoni.""  I asked, ""What time do you close?""  He says, ""Basically now.""  I said, ""10:00?""  He says, ""Yeah.""  I reply, ""But it's 9:20 right now.  That's 40 minutes from now.""  He didn't care.  I had very good service at Burger King that night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4

Benjamin W.,"North Port, FL",10,4,,5.0,5/27/2017,Went here a few weeks ago and forgot to comment. The place was very nice with a very nice staff. My wife and I ordered 2 different pizzas. Both were out in a timely fashion and were delicious. Will definitely return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4
Sara K.,"Tacoma, WA",19,28,7,3.0,4/24/2017,Nothing beats a hot fresh pizza after a week with no cheese! This hit the spot. Good service. 15 bucks for a small margherita pizza.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4
T M.,"Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco, CA",1,63,51,2.0,3/29/2017,Only thing good about it was that it was quick. I paid over $30 for some soggy over cheesed pizza. Super bummer. Sticking with Starbucks next time I'm here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4
Eric A.,"Saint Marys, GA",0,11,3,3.0,8/12/2017,"I had a morning flight and wanted breakfast.  The menu lists breakfast items, including The Works Breakfast Burrito.  I was surprised when the lady told me only pizza.  She quickly pointed and said something about whatever that was not working.  The pizza I ordered was pretty good, but breakfast was what I was after and the explanation/apology just didn't seem all that sincere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4
Gregg T.,"Salt Lake City, UT",125,79,31,3.0,9/27/2015,Caesar salad had wilty lettuce. I'd steer clear of grabbing a salad unless you thoroughly check the freshness of the leaves (which can be hard to do based on how they package it). The pizza was decently good. I got the Margarita pizza and it was better than I'd expect from food court pizza. So in short try the pizza and stay away from the salad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4
Barbara P.,"San Jose, CA",82,114,80,1.0,9/28/2016,You would think for $14 for a pizza they would be nice this gentlemen infront of me was paying in change and she grabbed it and put it to the side in a plate and not in the register ! Also We are airport employees and work for airlines we asked if we ca. Use out discount and she only let us use it once because she said we can only use it once even tho we had 3 transactions we all individually work for the airline she got off the register and stop helping customers to make sure we don't use out %10 again ! She was very rude and shrugged her shoulders I will just got eat somewhere else next time ! I will never come back here her name was Gemmalyn!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4
Vacation W.,"Weare, NH",0,10,3,1.0,3/13/2015,"First of all I generally like California Pizza Kitchen.  BUT, this location, not being able to utilize a brick oven, produces a very bland tasting pizza.  The pizza race track oven is like Dominos's, but even Domino's has more flavor. I ordered a margarita pizza and was very disappointed, especially the price for this, $13.99.   The crust definitely doesn't cut it.  Unfortunately if this were the first time I ever tried CPK, I wouldn't go back. Just an FYI CPK. This doesn't do your usual product justice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-4
