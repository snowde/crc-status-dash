Delores W.,"Barboursville, WV",0,9,5,5.0,3/4/2014,"Been here twice while we are in Birmingham. Great food.   Megan,  the manager and Ashley,  our server were fantastic.  Will be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover?start=20
Jim M.,"Milwaukee, WI",4,173,9,2.0,10/4/2013,"Horrible... ordered pizzas to go and waited at bar for 45 mins. We received drinks when ordering, but after that, no one came by and we were at the bar!!   Watching the staff, they were very confused and seemed to be running around without a leader.  The pizzas finally came, but had obviously been sitting around as they were quite cold. They made new ones in about 7 mins. Hence the reason for 2 stars instead of 1. Quality of the pizzas was mediocre at best.  I would not recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover?start=20
Steve B.,"Pelham, AL",0,1,,5.0,11/12/2011,"I usually get take out from CPK, and the food is always great. I have only had 1 or two times that the order was not right, but when I notified them of the error they were very apologetic and offered me a free appetizer on my next visit. My favorite dish is the Asparagus & Spinach Spaghettini (but I sub penne for the spaghettini.) My favorite salad is the Original chopped, but I take out the turkey and add bacon.  The best pizzas are the thin crust, with the Sicilian and Four Seasons topping the list.  A really great place to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover?start=20
Luke M.,"Birmingham, AL",6,27,,4.0,7/1/2012,"My kids love this place. Pizza is good.  I especially like the California Club pizza.  Have also gotten pasta which was good, not great.  For some reason place can get a little loud, not sure if it is layout or normal clientele.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover?start=20
Scott H.,"West Chester Township, OH",0,8,,1.0,7/22/2014,"Been here twice.  Good food but service is well below average.  Now I understand why. Tonight I observed someone in a management function walking around the back counter, pouring his owns drinks, and eating dinner at the bar. All while dressed inappropriately for a manager.  Fish stink at the head.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover?start=20
Melissa T.,"Denver, CO",83,279,35,2.0,11/29/2009,"In general I am a fan of California Pizza Kitchen, or CPK as it's affectionately known.  Their food is tasty, and the service is usually fine.  Not noteworthy for good or bad reasons.   I do wish they'd stop being pansy ass and provide their nutritional information online, but on the other hand I love that they sell their frozen pizzas in the grocery store.  I also like that all of their soups are vegetarian and labeled as such.  You'd be surprised how many places have vegetable soup made with chicken broth. This location is not a stellar example of the chain, though.  I've been here twice, and the second experience was super awkward.  One item we ordered never came, we had to ask for things several times, and then there was the beer situation. We asked about the ""Regional Selections"" the menu said would be available and were told they were Blue Moon and Sweetwater 420.  Now, Blue Moon is a product of Coors, and Coors is headquartered in Denver, so...yeah.  Not a regional selection by any stretch.  Sweetwater 420, on the other hand, is a product of Atlanta, fair enough, but when asked the server stammered that it was a wheat beer.  So, one was ordered and turns out it's actually a pale ale.  Now, being Coloradoans, I know our taste in beer is probably a little snootier than those in Alabama, where high gravity beer was just recently made legal at all.  That's fine, I don't expect servers at CPK in Alabama to know the difference between a pale ale and a wheat beer.  But I don't expect them to just make stuff up!  Beyond that, turns out the beer was actually *expired*, a month past its best by date.   We pointed this out, which prompted an extremely awkward visit from the store manager who awkwardly lingered awkwardly too long. The food was fine, the nice thing about big chains like that is that they're consistent, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover?start=20
Temeka W.,"Bessemer, AL",9,7,,5.0,10/27/2009,"I've been to this CPK a few times now and I've had excellent service each time. The staff is friendly and professional and the dishes are delicious. There's a wide variety of pizzas, pastas, and salads to choose from so you won't get bored with the menu easily. Their drinks are FANTASTIC! I've had a Mango Lemonade and a Kiwi Lemonade before and there both great. It's almost worth just going there for the drinks lol. I also highly suggest leaving some room for dessert. Their Tiramisu is sooooooo good. They also have carry out service so you can take the awsomeness home! I have not used this service before, but I do plan to try it out soon. So In conclusion, I highly recommend California Pizza Kitchen for anyone that wants more upscale pizza restaurant experience at an affordable price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover?start=20
Sheri P.,"Birmingham, AL",21,119,35,4.0,2/11/2010,CPK is good. I like the one at The Summit because I love to sit outside when the weather is right. I love their salads and pizza. I also really like to go with friends because the atmosphere is perfect for it! We usually each get something different so we can all share! Yum-O! I also think I have always had fairly decent service there. I have been going to the one at the Summit since it opened. The one at the Galleria is great too but if I'm on 280 the outside seating at The Summit calls my name. I recommend it on a nice day. They have heaters and umbrella's so it is usually pretty comfortable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover?start=20
Charlotte P.,"Sulligent, AL",1,5,,5.0,2/16/2012,"This was our first visit to CPK.  We had a really great and attentive waiter, Jason, who made it a fun first experience. He had a great sense of humor and was able to do a really great job of helping us make good menu choices we would enjoy. Jason even brought a piece of salami for us to try before choosing to order a pizza including it as a topping. The restaurant was extremely clean and attractive with contemporary decor.  The restrooms were very clean as well.  The food was excellent, and the pizzas we ordered had a very fresh taste and had many unique and and unusual options. There were great choices for any taste preferences, and many options besides pizza.  You could also choose salads, pasta, or even tacos.  We liked our choices of the BBQ Chicken Pizza and their Meat Lovers pizza.  We even shared a dessert of the brownie sundae, which was good, even though a little pricey at $6.00. We split it between the three of us though, since it was pretty big. I'd say this is a great location to try this pizza chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover?start=20
Nancy I.,"Birmingham, AL",0,34,,5.0,2/7/2010,"The food was great! Our waiter knew the menu really well and was very helpful. I had the crab cakes($16) which were wonderful. I would definatly reccomend it.  My husband had the bbq pizza($12, I think), and it was good as always. For dessert we shared the apple crisp, which was also very good. The wait time was much shorter than that of other resaurants in the area. My only complaint would be the mixed drinks were on the exspensive side, $9.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover?start=20
Greg R.,"Birmingham, AL",40,212,,3.0,6/22/2016,When did CPK stop being a pizza restaurant?  Hardly any of the menu is about pizza anymore.   Service was average to good.    The pizza was served hot and pretty good.   I read some the bad reviews and luckily my experience was better.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover
Rupen  P.,"Hoover, AL",127,3,,1.0,7/9/2016,I believe corporate needs to start paying more attention to this location.  It used to be good over the years... But now it sucks...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover
Mike M.,"New Iberia, LA",0,3,,2.0,10/17/2015,"CPK is one of my favorite restaurants - but - this location is consistently a let down. The food often is flavorless or stale (chips) or brought at the wrong time (if appetizers are ordered at the same time as the main meal). The pepper grinders never work, the sweet tea may or may not be sweet on any given day. I can't see a restaurant can get this many things wrong on a perpetual basis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover
Cassie W.,"Savannah, GA",8,25,24,1.0,6/11/2016,"This location is the worst. Slow and way too over priced. I will NEVER go back to another CPK in my lifetime. This was the straw that broke the camels back. I pay an extra $2 for 3 tiny pieces of chicken on my pizza. My husband pays $1.50 to make his pizza thin, which is less crust. THEN, when I ask for extra ranch, it's going to be .50 extra. I don't appreciate being nickel and dimed to death. I was anticipating my to-go boxes to cost. I hope CPK goes bankrupt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover
Melody H.,"Birmingham, AL",21,131,9,2.0,3/26/2016,"Not sure what happened at this location, but the last couple of times we've gone service has been slow, but even worse, the pizzas have been cooked poorly.  The one that I got most recently was a thin crust and the edges were almost charcoal, there was also some black powder on the bottom, like the oven was dirty or something.  The regular crust pizzas have been overcooked as well, but not quite as bad.  Think they need to adjust their ovens or pay more attention to the cook on their pizzas - and don't serve them burned.  Not sure I'll be back to this one.  Never had a pizza cooked badly at the Summit location, so I'll stick with that one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover
Hannah M.,"Birmingham, AL",294,72,30,4.0,4/30/2016,"Experience consisted of really great food but less than average service. We sat outside, which was lovely, and had appetizers first then ordered a salad. The buffalo chicken salad is amazing. I ate every bit of it! The service was mediocre. As we all know, this can make or break a restaurant experience. I'll go back for the salad but hope for better service next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover
Ee Vonn Y.,"Oakland, CA",1167,1709,3217,2.0,8/5/2013,"Great service, environment, yet very mediocre pizza. The thin crust wasn't good. It was burnt and I had trouble biting into it. It was burnt beyond chewing. Get the original since it's small and sufficient enough for an adult while the crust being soft and fluffy for you to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover
Lisa S.,"Pelham, AL",0,10,1,2.0,7/9/2016,"Cpk is usually really good, but my food came out half cold & half hot. The noodles were half cooked. The shrimp wasn't all the way peeled (I had a jambalaya pasta dish). They were veryyyyy slow & it wasn't lunch or dinner time. The waitress asked if we wanted more drinks & we thought that meant free refills so we got charged for more drinks without knowing we'd be charged. The booth was dirty.  I was not happy to spend $72.33 on an awful experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover
Philip D.,"Birmingham, AL",0,11,3,2.0,8/17/2015,"We live close by and have dined here numerous times. On a recent visit, the food was good but the restaurant needs to be updated and cleaned. There is a certain odor when you walk in. I'm not sure if it's the carpet or what but it's a sour smell that is not pleasant. Also, don't look up. The ceiling is filthy. There is dust and dirt all around the air vents that is not noticeable because the ceiling is black. But you can see it during the day time. It's on the higher walls as well. I hope they take notice of this and make changes. It's hard to eat in a dirty/smelly place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover
Courtney O.,"Birmingham, AL",113,40,21,5.0,11/11/2014,"This is the most awesome pizza place in Birmingham, AL hands down.  I absolutely love this place! What makes it even better is that they have a great staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover
Cat A.,"Birmingham, AL",0,99,10,2.0,12/12/2015,"I love CPK's frozen pizzas you get at the stores. However, the dishes in their restaurants aren't quite as good. I probably wouldn't mind the food as much if it wasn't so overpriced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover
Stacy T.,"Prattville, AL",53,2,,5.0,1/15/2016,"This isn't just a excellent pizza place they also have amazing other dishes like Mahi Mahi fish tacos, salads and my favorite chicken piccata.

Britney M.,"Mobile, AL",47,20,2,1.0,12/28/2014,Holy terrible service. we had the most awful waiter no personality. No service whatsoever. We were brought hot tea (with anticipation of it being cold) he laughed about it. We asked for ice we never got. He was so rude when he was to take our order.

Pam H.,"Birmingham, AL",0,2,5,1.0,3/9/2016,Where do I start? Party of 7 arrived @11 we waited 45 minutes for food and  it came out cold. I sent the Bianco Flatbread back and it never arrived. Horrible!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover
Alyssa H.,"Vance, AL",47,1,,1.0,6/1/2015,"This pizza is certainly not for me. The crust was extremely thin on the deep dish, and it was burnt, which of course burnt the cheese.

Donna S.,"Hoover, AL",0,2,,2.0,10/23/2015,"I use to love CPK.  However, I don't really think that CPK is a good value now.   Very little chicken on our salads for the price.  You can find much better meals for this price around Hoover.  Also the table was sticky from previous guests.  We will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover
Mandy C.,"Fort Myers, FL",380,298,872,4.0,10/19/2010,"We ordered takeout on a lazy, I don't feel like cooking Tuesday night. I love places that let me order online. And the CPK site is super easy to use and add on things. You can request your pick up time... We ordered the Baja and Mediterranean Spring Rolls. I could eat several orders of these... They are that good! We got 4 pizzas.... Since we usually order two medium pizzas we thought four of these smaller portion ones would be enough. It ended up being too much! The thin crusts are larger than the whole wheat crusts, so we had two real big pizzas! Chicken club- ok. Exactly what I expected,so no complaints just not overly impressed. Cheeseburger- hubbys favorite and my second choice. Will order it again 4 cheese with grilled chicken- a good cheesy choice but our least fav of the four Artichoke &spinach with grilled chicken- this was my fav. Full of flavor but light and it had tons of chicken Good choice for a lazy dinner night! Definitely a much better pizza choice than the standard chains... But as with all good food, comes the price. Don't plan on a cheap pizza combo deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover
Sarah D.,"Calera, AL",33,59,,3.0,7/23/2012,"My family and I went there recently. Our waitress paid little attention to us. She took a long time to even greet us, serve our drinks-which were never refilled, and serve our pizza.  I complained later and got some nice coupons, so my mom, husband, and I went back and got an old classmate of mine to serve us. She was great! I honestly believe that she was good to us because she cares about her job, but it was nice that I also knew her! The food is good. I like their pasta a lot, but there needs to be more of it. But, overall, it's good food. I would just lower the prices some. So, thanks for caring, CPK. Your response and good bartender that served us the second time is what saved you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover
Tim K.,"McCalla, AL",13,25,,5.0,11/12/2012,"I have been looking for a good pizza place since I moved to Birmingham. By luck I found California Pizza Kitchen, I have heard of them before but never tried their pies. They were doing free meals for Veterans and thought I would partake. Very good pizza, the combination of the crust sauce cheese and toppings worked really good together.  And I have to give a shout out to the company. They gave free meals to Veterans all day Sunday and Monday for Veterans Day, Not only that they gave each Veteran who came in a coupon for a free meal at any later date, this company gets the very rarely seen, a bobo two thumbs up for service and taste. Meals are generally between 10 to 15 dollars, worth every cent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover
Mia B.,"Champaign, IL",44,72,186,3.0,2/17/2014,"It was ok, I love saucy pizza and I specifically asked for extra sauce and the pizza came out dry as a door knob.  I had to ask for more sauce on the side and ending up dipping my slices into the sauce which made the pizza better.  I would eat here again, but I'm still searching for my pizza place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover
