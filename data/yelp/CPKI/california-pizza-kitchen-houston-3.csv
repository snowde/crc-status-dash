PanDee L.,"Buena Park, CA",35,1,1,5.0,7/22/2017,"This was my first time coming to this CPK. I have been to a few other CPK locations in the Houston area so my expectations for this place was pretty high. I had order the new 'Carne Asada' pizza, it turned out delicious!! I am pretty satisfied with my order and I definitely would order that again! And although there were not many people around the noon time.. it wasn't too bad!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3
Michelle U.,"Houston, TX",719,67,149,2.0,4/19/2017,"My first time coming to California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) in about 4-5 years and I was a bit surprised that they are more of an actual restaurant serving a variety of foods, rather than specializing in pizza like they used to. For a restaurant that is specifically a pizza kitchen, their pizza seems to come secondary on their menu.  Food: - They do serve complimentary French bread.  - Fried mac & cheese: not worth it 3/5 it was kind of bland and only comes with 4 small pieces.  - BBQ Chicken Pizza: what I came to CPK for. 3/5 Definitely not as flavorful as it was years ago and gave me an upset stomach shortly after eating it.  Overall, would not come back here. For a restaurant that is a pizza kitchen, it's disappointing that the pizza is just mediocre.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3
Monica D.,"Houston, TX",97,123,20,1.0,5/2/2017,"Sad pizza with light ingredients, I probably haven't been to a CPK in many years and that is the way it will stay. They just aren't what they were the pizza is so mediocre, no real flavor and expensive. If you want great Pizza try Solario or Luna. I think it's time to wrap it up CPK let a better restaurant have the space!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3

Anna C.,"Houston, TX",61,41,42,5.0,1/21/2017,The Garlic Crème fettuccine was so good!! The shrimp was cooked to perfection! The waiter was so very nice. I was at a table of five and he was very patient with us and came over frequently to make sure we were enjoying our meal. Not over crowded at all! The waiters are friendly and the manager came over to ask us how our meal was and thanked us for coming.

Vlad V.,"The Heights, Houston, TX",189,679,188,4.0,5/3/2016,"When you're in River Oaks, you have a wide-selection of upscale restaurants. Heck, when you're looking for pizza in Houston, there are so many great local joints. But sometimes, a man in River Oaks just wants a casual meal at a chain. California Pizza Kitchen is located close to River Oaks Theater with a public parking lot available across the street behind La Griglia. Service was great, quick, prompt, and polite. I started off with the crispy mac and cheese which is basically breaded mac and cheese. You get four good-size pieces which are dipped in cheese so you get a little cheese on the outside and inside. Hey throw cheese on anything, I'm a fan. The mac and cheese was baked/fried to perfection with a nice crispy exterior.  Washed it all down with one of their mango strawberries coolers which is a refreshing mix of juice and soda. After that came CPK's most popular dish, the BBQ chicken pizza. Only one size is available, and it's pretty pricey, but hey we're in River Oaks. Smoked gouda, red onions, and grilled chicken on a medium sized pizza drizzled with BBQ sauce. The BBQ sauce has a nice tanginess to it. You also have the option of a wheat gluten-free crust if you would like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3
Diana A.,"Houston, TX",0,5,,3.0,6/24/2017,"I enjoyed our meal, but it's too pricey for what you get.  Very trendy.  Hipster place.  I am not into trendy food, but we met friends who live nearby, and it was an enjoyable dinner.  Our table had the spinach and mozzarella flatbread, which was delicious.  We also had the jerk chicken pizza and The Works.  The jerk chicken was also covered in different types of peppers.  The Works was tasty, but I don't care for the Italian sausage.  I would like to try the pasta if I ever return, which is unlikely because it didn't wow me.  It absolutely was not worth the price..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3
Mary K.,"Cypress, TX",0,4,,3.0,6/6/2017,"The food is good but just too expensive.  The salad is pretty small and with avacado, it is $15.00.   There is never anyone in the restaurant at lunch time.  The smell is overwhelming and enough to keep me from eating in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3
Naya C.,"Houston, TX",38,11,3,2.0,3/7/2017,Please don't come here for the gluten-free pizza if you're allergic. My $7 gluten-free frozen pizza from Kroger (SmartFlour) is soooooo much better. The crust on CPK's $17 pizza kept getting tougher after every bite until finally I couldn't eat it anymore because it was like rubberized cardboard. My jaw hurts from trying. The BBQ chicken toppings were almost decent..  but I could probably make something better out of canned chicken and ketchup at home.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3
Katlyn K.,"Houston, TX",179,214,,4.0,1/21/2016,"CPK is a favorite take out option of ours - the food is always hot and fresh, ordering is quick and easy, and the menu has so many options you can never get bored.   The Thai Crunch salad is my favorite, with lots of healthy vegetables and a light dressing - I order it with shrimp instead of chicken, but I'm sure it's just as good with other proteins.  To go with the salad I get the smashed pea and barley soup for a full meal, and it's perfect!   The pizzas are also really great - my husband prefers the regular crust, but the thin crust varieties are also good.  He likes the chipotle chicken and the mushroom pepperoni sausage.  Portion size could feed one adult who is really hungry, or could be shared between two adults with a split entree or salad.  Spinach parmesan dip and the Corn Guacamole are delicious starters and a convenient item if you are ordering take out, and the desserts look tempting, but we've never tried them.  Maybe next time! Cheers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3
Grace K.,"Knoxville, TN",263,256,1093,3.0,5/17/2015,"My friend was craving California Pizza Kitchen (CPK), so I went with her recently. CPK is one of those places where neither I would choose nor complain about.  Pizzas: Pear & Gorgonzola (2/5): Pears, sweet caramelized onions, hazelnuts, blue cheese, topped with chilled field greens in Gorgonzola ranch. I wanted to try something foreign on my pizza. I immediately chose this when I saw ""pear"". It was a different story once I took a few bites. Pear was bland.. I thought it would bring a sweet contrast against the distinct flavors of blue cheese and hazelnut. Chunks of blue cheese over powered the pizza with some bites. My friend and I didn't enjoy this as much.  Original BBQ Chicken (4/5): BBQ sauce, smoked Gouda, red onions, and cilantro. CPK is highly known for its famous Chicken BBQ. The pizza is perfectly tangy and sweet with a kick. Chicken is bland and overcooked sometimes. Order this if you are afraid to go outside your zone. Spicy Chipotle Chicken (4/5): Chipotle adobo sauce, shaved poblano, Monterey Jack with house made corn, black beans, salsa, cilantro, and lime cream. The cream is superb... I always ask for additional! If I would describe this, then I would say it is the pizza you would get if Chipotle restaurants decided to expand their menu. By the way, poblanos are not spicy at all.  California Club (5/5): Smoked bacon, roasted chicken, mozzarella, avocado, arugula, basil, romaine with lemon pepper mayonnaise. Hands down the best one I have tried at CPK. Fresh. Light. Delicious. It is like a chicken salad pizza! The lemon pepper mayonnaise goes perfectly well with other ingredients. Just make sure you order one when you do try this place!  Wild Mushroom (3/5): Shaved cremini, shiitake, portobello, white mushrooms with slivered scallions, black pepper, Pecorino Romano and mozzarella. Nothing really appealed to me... Felt like something was missing. My friend loves mushrooms, so I tried a slice of it. Great for vegetarians.  I prefer this location than the one in Memorial City, too many kids. It is more of an adult place here. There are days when the waiter fills my water before it reaches rock bottom. Service is average with plenty of seating available. I believe the longest wait time I had was about 10 minutes.  CPK serves other food items, which has significantly expanded since my first CPK dining. I don't know if I would try the other items such as salads and soups. After all, it is a pizza kitchen. ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3
Alexis B.,"Nashville, TN",688,1652,2514,3.0,6/26/2015,"Yes, it's a chain.  But it happens to be a pretty good chain!  Not a bad place to grab a bite!

Katie W.,"Houston, TX",86,314,1,4.0,4/8/2016,"Service was a bit slow, but I think they were slammed for lunch.  Since it was my first time at the restaurant, they offered a complimentary flatbread, which was quite a nice touch.  The lunch specials are good, but I opted for a half salad.  The salad was massive, I cannot imagine what the full salad is like.  The avocado add on was pricey at nearly $3, but they were very generous with the avocado, so it was worth it.  The mushroom and spinach flatbread was good, perfect for sharing.  The Thai salad was amazing, it was the perfect mix of ingredients.  The restaurant had a deal with my daughter's school to give 20% of our meal price to the school, which is a lovely gesture and very much appreciated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3
Ed S.,"Houston, TX",57,185,110,3.0,5/8/2015,"Great?  No.  Horrible? No.  Let's just say California pizza is no threat to NY or Chicago style pizza.  Still, the pizza, while sparse on the toppings, had good flavor and better than average crust.  Lunch time service was excellent. Good value if you can deal with the hassle of finding a spot to park.  Or, you can add $6 to the tab and valet park.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3
Kris K.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,4.0,4/24/2017,"Pizza is fantastic for a chain.  Only issue that ordering delivery through Yelp is arrives cold. We have now ordered twice to test the system.  I thought the first time may have been a poor experience with delivery.   Pizzas are worthy of ordering but only if they arrive hot. The delivery service does not have any type of hot bag. Therefore, they arrive in a brown CA pizza kitchen bag cold.   Great pizza- but pick it up yourself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3
Celeste B.,"Kingwood, TX",8,39,4,1.0,8/7/2016,"If I could leave no stars I would. I ordered from them through Restaurants On The Run for a big lunch at my company with about 15 members of our management team. The salads looked great but the pizzas were AWFUL and looked like the  cold pizza that had been sitting in your fridge for two days - shrunken up, dried out and the crusts were even curving up. I was mortified because it was too late to order elsewhere and my people had to eat. Needless to say the salads were eaten and only about half the pizza was picked through. So disappointed. CPK was supposed to be the upper crust (pun intended) but you would be better off order Dominos.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3
Jessica L.,"Westport, CT",0,12,,1.0,1/27/2017,"Just gross from beginning to end.  Host sat us at a dirty table- when we asked if they could wipe it down he continued to place the menus on top of the mess and walk away.  The whole place smelled like a strong floral cleaning solution - Fabuloso or something - it was so overpowering it gave me a headache and not what you want to smell when you're eating.  The waiter was rude and sarcastic.  The pizzas were undercooked, doughy, luke warm.  Didn't expect a lot for CPK - but you can usually count on a bare minimum from a crappy chain like this.  The one in galleria is much better.  Will never go back here with the family again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3

Theresa N.,"Georgetown, TX",50,424,44,3.0,7/19/2013,"I visited here yesterday and got the Grilled Veggie Sandwich.   The bread was rubbery, the veggies were tasteless.    I expected the bread to be toasted since it was a grilled sandwich, maybe that's why the bread was elastic.   My friend got some kind of wonton, she ate it all and then some.  Everything did seem fresh, however.   Bread and olive oil served before your meal.  The iced  tea was very good.  The place is bright and clean, casual and upbeat, and  the booths were great for sitting and talking for a long time after our meal was finished. We didn't feel rushed to vacate the premises,   the waitress was attentive and filled our tea glasses even after we paid the bill.  Service was quick, but we were one of maybe four tables there. Nevertheless, the noise does travel quite a bit as we heard everything the chatty  girls   had to say to each other in the booth next to us.    I go here from time to time when I'm in the area because my friend likes it.  I would probably go again to try other items on the menu.

Karen L.,"Daly City, CA",547,388,4336,2.0,12/2/2012,I ordered the Waldorf Salad and my sister ordered the Thai Crunch Salad. My salad was too citrusy for my taste and I couldn't finish it. We shared a Spinach and Artichoke Dip as an appetizer but we both agreed that the one my sister makes tastes better. I would not recommend it.

Reason being that there are so many great pizza establishments here in Houston to satisfy a pizza craving. I will suggest Top it, Star, or Ciao Bello before even thinking of CPK. As a place that specializes in pizza, they do just alright. It doesn't blow your mind but it's not bad either. I can appreciate the special pizzas they offer like their bbq chicken or the habanero carnitas (actually not as spicy as you think). The avocado club rolls aren't bad either and it comes with 2 dipping sauces.... and if you know me, I love a dip. (when I dip, you dip, we dip!) Their drinks are tasty too. I enjoy a good tropical sangria from here. They have a great adventure policy as well. They welcome you to eat outside the box and order something new to try.

Ambiance: Loud, open dining area. It is located on the side of a strip mall, so it's not anything fancy.  Service: Slow and basic.

L S.,"Houston, TX",3,35,2,5.0,5/9/2014,"This is a fantastic location - especially if you're looking for yummy gluten-free food. CPK has a great BBQ chicken pizza (add the bacon!), that I always get alongside the The Moroccan Chicken Salad (one of my favorite items on the menu). If you get the large salad portion, they'll separate it into two plates and it's enough for a whole meal.  The manager is fantastic -  consistently super-friendly and accommodating with all of my requests (like changing out cheese for garlic). He also visits our table each time we order anything gluten-free to discuss how they are certified and have a separate uncontaminated area to prepare the GF food. It's the only place I've found in Houston that does this. When the manager isn't there, someone always comes by to tell us about their process. Everyone seems well aware they practice this and are very respectful (and low-key) about the whole thing. I can't say enough great things about the manager and staff.  I finally have a favorite pizza joint that I can rely on for delicious food that won't leave me clutching my stomach in pain for days.

We went on a Friday evening hoping to get a quick yummy but date-y dinner in before a trip to the River Oaks theater, and had a great experience. This location is new to us but we have been long time patrons of the one near the galleria. I really like CPK. The food has good variety. My favorite pizzas are the japanese eggplant (get the goat cheese!) and the pear gorgonzola. I feel validated paying more money for these because well they are something special even though this is a chain. I'm also a five year old and love *excuse me* LOVE the strawberry lemonade:) I'm glad my server the last time asked me if I wanted one to go.  One thing though: don't bother with the cocktails.

They get busy quickly at peak times, and so you may wait if not early to arrive. i recommend going around 11:30 for lunch during the week to avoid waiting. the staff is always very courteous and professional. Managers regularly come by to make sure service has been satisfactory. my favorites are; the grilled vegetable salad, hummus, white bean minestrone soup, and the tostada pizza.  the only con are the calories. i mean, yes, its pizza for pete's sake- nobody should expect it to be lo-cal, but some of the salads and things they tote as ""healthy"" are actually higher in calories than entire pizzas. so just be savvy if you are watching calories, and read the nutritional info online, before guessing if something is actually healthy. in case anyone is wondering, i ran the weight watchers points on some of the items there, and the lowest calorie options were, all the soups (specifically the asparagus and the minestrone), and the pesto thin crust pizza, and the grilled veg salad, half portion, with light vinaigrette on the side. but really, the pizzas are so good, don't let calories stop it...it is after-all, pizza!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3?start=60

New on their menu is the Jamaican jerk chicken which is now my new favorite. For a long time I was a tandoori mango chicken fan until they took it off the menu (gasp!)  One of the things I like about CPK is their food is consistent and their menu offers a good variety. It's not all Italian; they do a good job in blending other ethnic flavors into their food. They also have a decent cocktail, beer and wine menu. I was so glad when they opened this location, it makes picking up to-go orders much closer. However, the curbside parking for this location is very confusing. Just FYI, it's in the back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3?start=60
Matthew H.,"Houston, TX",371,1,,5.0,10/23/2014,So I went there to dine the other night and I cannot say anything but that it was amazing.  The atmosphere was quiet and the lighting was just right.  Extensive menu and everything they brought past me to other tables looked scrumptious.  i ordered the shrimp and zuccini pasta.  Hands down the best pasta I have had in years.  Amazing service!!!!  My waiter Jorge seemed like a hardworking college student and I had to leave him a $50.00 tip for his amazing wait service.  I truly recommend this for anyone in the area or looking for a place to take a date or family.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3?start=60
Sandra P.,"Portland, OR",159,43,14,2.0,11/18/2010,"Most of the pizzas I've tried here have been good... I usually get their Margarita pizza and on the most part I'm satisfied.  I always ask for extra basil regardless of if there's an extra charge or not.  But the last few times I requested this they seemingly put maybe 5 shards more of basil on it than usual.  It was still a good pizza but if a customer is willing to pay extra for more of a topping to have it exactly how they like it then I think a restaurant should accomodate accordingly.   Also I just tried the Korean steak tacos on their ""Small Bites"" menu.  Let me tell you they're not kidding when they say SMALL BITES.  Don't expect much for the $6 you pay for it.  There's 2 tacos on the plate and they're not that much bigger than the size of chinese dumplings when you wrap it up.  The flavor was good but I'd never order this again just because of the size of these suckers.  Each taco can literally be killed in 2 bites.  You can go to a Korean restaurant off Longpoint and get a full meal with the same flavor for not that much more in price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3?start=60

Patrick S.,"Houston, TX",10,19,,5.0,5/29/2009,"I'll go ahead and throw in 5 stars to offset the ""pizza snobs"" below.  I just had CKP for the first time today, and I was pleasantly surprised at everything it offered.  The service was pretty decent. The hostess was pleasant (it's her job after all) and quickly got our table for 8 pushed together and set up. The place was pretty large, and there was plenty of space between tables. One complaint would be that the takeout was at the back, so everyone getting takeout had to walk through the restaurant. The pizza came as quick as pizza comes, drinks were refilled often, and the split checks were accurate.  The food was pretty damn good. I got to sample my own (sweet-spicy italian pizza), the Sicilian pizza (i think), some garden pizza (had broccoli), and the salad with walnuts and some sliced pear.  My favorite pizza was the sicilian... kinda a meat lovers in a spicy italian way. Lots of meat on top and good cheese were what set it apart. The salad was amazing, definitely if you can spare the extra few bucks try the salad.  Anyways, all-in-all good experience, could be a bit quieter. but I'll definitely sample CKP again.

I went there last night with my boyfriend for dinner, expecting the same experience we'd had every time before: nice people, slow service, clean restaurant. We got everything except the cleanliness. We sat at the bar (after standing there for a good 30 seconds trying to figure out which place was dirty and which was clean) and finally took a chair that had a menu in it, hoping we hadn't stolen someone's seat. There were at least six glasses of varying fullness all over the bar, along with napkins and various other signs that someone had eaten there somewhat recently...or so I thought. The entire time that we were there, nobody made a single attempt to clear the bar off, and we were there for a good hour and a half. The bartender before had been a very attentive, very nice girl who actually looked like she didn't hate being at work. This guy was her antithesis. He seemed entirely unenthusiastic to be at work, didn't smile at us once and barely spoke loud enough to be heard.

The salad had cabbage, shrimp, avocado, daikon radish and edamame, in a very light dressing. The shrimp were surprisingly abundant and not all fishy. I liked how they didn't overwhelm the salad with wonton strips, just enough to give it a bit of crunch. The avocado really added a lot in terms of flavor and texture.

Then we got the bill -- it turns out the $5 price tag ""by the glass"" was for a mini pour, and I had gotten a different, normal pour, which was closer to $10.

Heck, when you're looking for pizza in Houston, there are so many great local joints. But sometimes, a man in River Oaks just wants a casual meal at a chain. California Pizza Kitchen is located close to River Oaks Theater with a public parking lot available across the street behind La Griglia. Service was great, quick, prompt, and polite. I started off with the crispy mac and cheese which is basically breaded mac and cheese. You get four good-size pieces which are dipped in cheese so you get a little cheese on the outside and inside. Hey throw cheese on anything, I'm a fan. The mac and cheese was baked/fried to perfection with a nice crispy exterior.  Washed it all down with one of their mango strawberries coolers which is a refreshing mix of juice and soda. After that came CPK's most popular dish, the BBQ chicken pizza. Only one size is available, and it's pretty pricey, but hey we're in River Oaks.

My $7 gluten-free frozen pizza from Kroger (SmartFlour) is soooooo much better. The crust on CPK's $17 pizza kept getting tougher after every bite until finally I couldn't eat it anymore because it was like rubberized cardboard. My jaw hurts from trying.

Katlyn K.,"Houston, United States",179,214,,4.0,21/1/2016,"CPK is a favorite take out option of ours - the food is always hot and fresh, ordering is quick and easy, and the menu has so many options you can never get bored.   The Thai Crunch salad is my favorite, with lots of healthy vegetables and a light dressing - I order it with shrimp instead of chicken, but I'm sure it's just as good with other proteins.  To go with the salad I get the smashed pea and barley soup for a full meal, and it's perfect!   The pizzas are also really great - my husband prefers the regular crust, but the thin crust varieties are also good.  He likes the chipotle chicken and the mushroom pepperoni sausage.  Portion size could feed one adult who is really hungry, or could be shared between two adults with a split entree or salad.  Spinach parmesan dip and the Corn Guacamole are delicious starters and a convenient item if you are ordering take out, and the desserts look tempting, but we've never tried them.  Maybe next time!

Grace K.,"Knoxville, United States",263,256,1093,3.0,17/5/2015,"My friend was craving California Pizza Kitchen (CPK), so I went with her recently. CPK is one of those places where neither I would choose nor complain about.  Pizzas: Pear & Gorgonzola (2/5): Pears, sweet caramelized onions, hazelnuts, blue cheese, topped with chilled field greens in Gorgonzola ranch. I wanted to try something foreign on my pizza. I immediately chose this when I saw ""pear"". It was a different story once I took a few bites. Pear was bland.. I thought it would bring a sweet contrast against the distinct flavors of blue cheese and hazelnut. Chunks of blue cheese over powered the pizza with some bites. My friend and I didn't enjoy this as much.  Original BBQ Chicken (4/5): BBQ sauce, smoked Gouda, red onions, and cilantro. CPK is highly known for its famous Chicken BBQ. The pizza is perfectly tangy and sweet with a kick. Chicken is bland and overcooked sometimes. Order this if you are afraid to go outside your zone. Spicy Chipotle Chicken (4/5): Chipotle adobo sauce, shaved poblano, Monterey Jack with house made corn, black beans, salsa, cilantro, and lime cream. The cream is superb... I always ask for additional! If I would describe this, then I would say it is the pizza you would get if Chipotle restaurants decided to expand their menu. By the way, poblanos are not spicy at all.  California Club (5/5): Smoked bacon, roasted chicken, mozzarella, avocado, arugula, basil, romaine with lemon pepper mayonnaise. Hands down the best one I have tried at CPK. Fresh. Light. Delicious. It is like a chicken salad pizza! The lemon pepper mayonnaise goes perfectly well with other ingredients. Just make sure you order one when you do try this place!  Wild Mushroom (3/5): Shaved cremini, shiitake, portobello, white mushrooms with slivered scallions, black pepper, Pecorino Romano and mozzarella. Nothing really appealed to me... Felt like something was missing. My friend loves mushrooms, so I tried a slice of it. Great for vegetarians.  I prefer this location than the one in Memorial City, too many kids. It is more of an adult place here. There are days when the waiter fills my water before it reaches rock bottom. Service is average with plenty of seating available. I believe the longest wait time I had was about 10 minutes.  CPK serves other food items, which has significantly expanded since my first CPK dining. I don't know if I would try the other items such as salads and soups. After all, it is a pizza kitchen. ;)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3

The place is bright and clean, casual and upbeat, and  the booths were great for sitting and talking for a long time after our meal was finished.

As a place that specializes in pizza, they do just alright. It doesn't blow your mind but it's not bad either. I can appreciate the special pizzas they offer like their bbq chicken or the habanero carnitas (actually not as spicy as you think). The avocado club rolls aren't bad either and it comes with 2 dipping sauces.... and if you know me, I love a dip. (when I dip, you dip, we dip!) Their drinks are tasty too.

The manager is fantastic -  consistently super-friendly and accommodating with all of my requests (like changing out cheese for garlic). He also visits our table each time we order anything gluten-free to discuss how they are certified and have a separate uncontaminated area to prepare the GF food. It's the only place I've found in Houston that does this. When the manager isn't there, someone always comes by to tell us about their process. Everyone seems well aware they practice this and are very respectful (and low-key) about the whole thing.

The pizza was good, though a bit cheesier than I generally like. The server was awesome -- he had the kitchen slightly burn the pizza, as I requested. Then we got the bill -- it turns out the $5 price tag ""by the glass"" was for a mini pour, and I had gotten a different, normal pour, which was closer to $10. It was my mistake, for not reading carefully, but I felt a bit deceived. ""By the glass"" means by the glass, right? So by all means this is not a scathing review. So-so pizza and the little trick they played on me got the 3 star review.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3?start=40
Alfonso D.,"Houston, United States",0,33,,1.0,13/8/2013,"I went back to CPK ... and it still sucks.

The place was almost completely empty, but we just decided to sit at the bar. The bartender (I didnt catch her name) was actually super nice and gave us really good service. We split a small plates salad (arugula and asparagus) and also split the California Club pizza. I mean they were both good, and the pricing is totally doable.

Nikki B.,"Dallas, United States",2098,601,409,5.0,28/7/2010,"I hate eating at chains while visiting another city, but we were too hungry to drive elsewhere and decide, so CPK it was! I was craving a good salad, so the half original bbq chopped salad was awesomely satisfying. It was loaded with super yummy flavors, fresh ingredients, creaming dressing and just the right amount of food. I walked away full but not stuffed.  Their menu, like others have stated, is ginormous. You can also find the nutritional content online if you're trying to stick to a diet... but then again, if you're on a diet maybe you shouldn't be at CPK. The restaurant was really clean and open. Since it was near 2pm, the place was empty but we still received great service from a friendly waiter. The restrooms were also spotless and I could tell they keep things in tip-top shape around here. Like I said, I'm not really a big fan of chains, but this CPK isn't too shabby!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3?start=40
Norm L.,"Greenspoint, Houston, United States",1,5,,3.0,17/1/2014,"They say to be adventurous  because if you don't like a dish, they will let you switch. So, I ordered a Chile Relleno. It was on the Lite menu, because it is baked, not fried. Delicious and heathy period.  5 star food item. Poblano pepper was not breaded, and not soggy. The stuffing of chicken (not enough though), black beans, small pieces of squash, and some other stuff, covered with cheese, was flavorful, and no watery parts. Now the negative. Some dishes are overpriced for the quantity.  The Relleno was not very filling. Service was slow.  It was hard to get the waiter's attention.  In fact, he often went in the kitchen to do things like stack trays and chat with others. No wonder the place lacks customers. But food taste is good.  I will be back for the Relleno.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3?start=40

Teresa M.,"Houston, United States",107,196,2,4.0,30/7/2011,"Decent prices, good creative pizzas, and for this location especially, awesome service! We went on a Friday evening hoping to get a quick yummy but date-y dinner in before a trip to the River Oaks theater, and had a great experience. This location is new to us but we have been long time patrons of the one near the galleria. I really like CPK. The food has good variety. My favorite pizzas are the japanese eggplant (get the goat cheese!) and the pear gorgonzola. I feel validated paying more money for these because well they are something special even though this is a chain. I'm also a five year old and love *excuse me* LOVE the strawberry lemonade:) I'm glad my server the last time asked me if I wanted one to go.  One thing though: don't bother with the cocktails. The wines are good here; but their mojitos are too sweet and not strong.  We'll be back! It's not cheap but we always have a good experience. It's not romantic in a kitschy way but we like dates here.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3?start=60
Kristen S.,"Houston, United States",59,273,69,4.0,31/8/2010,"I love their salads, pizza, and soups, everything I have tried I have loved. They get busy quickly at peak times, and so you may wait if not early to arrive. i recommend going around 11:30 for lunch during the week to avoid waiting. the staff is always very courteous and professional. Managers regularly come by to make sure service has been satisfactory. my favorites are; the grilled vegetable salad, hummus, white bean minestrone soup, and the tostada pizza.  the only con are the calories. i mean, yes, its pizza for pete's sake- nobody should expect it to be lo-cal, but some of the salads and things they tote as ""healthy"" are actually higher in calories than entire pizzas. so just be savvy if you are watching calories, and read the nutritional info online, before guessing if something is actually healthy. in case anyone is wondering, i ran the weight watchers points on some of the items there, and the lowest calorie options were, all the soups (specifically the asparagus and the minestrone), and the pesto thin crust pizza, and the grilled veg salad, half portion, with light vinaigrette on the side. but really, the pizzas are so good, don't let calories stop it...it is after-all, pizza!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3?start=60

Julia S.,"Houston, United States",117,294,355,3.0,25/1/2010,"There are only a handful of national chain restaurants that I like and CPK is one of them. They actually serve good wood fired pizzas here. New on their menu is the Jamaican jerk chicken which is now my new favorite. For a long time I was a tandoori mango chicken fan until they took it off the menu (gasp!)  One of the things I like about CPK is their food is consistent and their menu offers a good variety. It's not all Italian; they do a good job in blending other ethnic flavors into their food. They also have a decent cocktail, beer and wine menu. I was so glad when they opened this location, it makes picking up to-go orders much closer. However, the curbside parking for this location is very confusing. Just FYI, it's in the back.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3?start=60

Sandra P.,"Portland, United States",159,43,14,2.0,18/11/2010,"Most of the pizzas I've tried here have been good... I usually get their Margarita pizza and on the most part I'm satisfied.  I always ask for extra basil regardless of if there's an extra charge or not.  But the last few times I requested this they seemingly put maybe 5 shards more of basil on it than usual.  It was still a good pizza but if a customer is willing to pay extra for more of a topping to have it exactly how they like it then I think a restaurant should accomodate accordingly.   Also I just tried the Korean steak tacos on their ""Small Bites"" menu.  Let me tell you they're not kidding when they say SMALL BITES.  Don't expect much for the $6 you pay for it.  There's 2 tacos on the plate and they're not that much bigger than the size of chinese dumplings when you wrap it up.  The flavor was good but I'd never order this again just because of the size of these suckers.  Each taco can literally be killed in 2 bites.  You can go to a Korean restaurant off Longpoint and get a full meal with the same flavor for not that much more in price.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3?start=60
Catalin B.,"Redwood City, United States",12,110,22,4.0,3/6/2012,Okay it's a chain restaurant so pretty much everyone knows how the food is.

Patrick S.,"Houston, United States",10,19,,5.0,29/5/2009,"I'll go ahead and throw in 5 stars to offset the ""pizza snobs"" below.  I just had CKP for the first time today, and I was pleasantly surprised at everything it offered.  The service was pretty decent. The hostess was pleasant (it's her job after all) and quickly got our table for 8 pushed together and set up. The place was pretty large, and there was plenty of space between tables. One complaint would be that the takeout was at the back, so everyone getting takeout had to walk through the restaurant. The pizza came as quick as pizza comes, drinks were refilled often, and the split checks were accurate.  The food was pretty damn good. I got to sample my own (sweet-spicy italian pizza), the Sicilian pizza (i think), some garden pizza (had broccoli), and the salad with walnuts and some sliced pear.  My favorite pizza was the sicilian... kinda a meat lovers in a spicy italian way. Lots of meat on top and good cheese were what set it apart. The salad was amazing, definitely if you can spare the extra few bucks try the salad.  Anyways, all-in-all good experience, could be a bit quieter. but I'll definitely sample CKP again.

The BBQ chicken pizza with honey wheat crust is always a good call...but I've since started making my own at home which is much more fun.  The Santa Fe chicken pizza is also very delicious....chicken, caramelized onions, guac, sour cream, and pico are all things that I want atop my dough.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3?start=60

Yes, this particular one is slow, but I was never sure if it was just the kitchen or all of the chains, because I know pizza is hard to get out quickly, even if it is thin crust. I went there last night with my boyfriend for dinner, expecting the same experience we'd had every time before: nice people, slow service, clean restaurant. We got everything except the cleanliness. We sat at the bar (after standing there for a good 30 seconds trying to figure out which place was dirty and which was clean) and finally took a chair that had a menu in it, hoping we hadn't stolen someone's seat. There were at least six glasses of varying fullness all over the bar, along with napkins and various other signs that someone had eaten there somewhat recently...or so I thought. The entire time that we were there, nobody made a single attempt to clear the bar off, and we were there for a good hour and a half. The bartender before had been a very attentive, very nice girl who actually looked like she didn't hate being at work. This guy was her antithesis. He seemed entirely unenthusiastic to be at work, didn't smile at us once and barely spoke loud enough to be heard. Honestly, this didn't bother me nearly as much as the dirty bar, but come on guys...you can do better!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3?start=60

Agustin S.,"Houston, United States",285,274,38,3.0,4/5/2008,"CPK is what  it is, a chain with better food than most chains.  The menu is diverse so if your with a big group or if you can't make up your mind on what you want to eat the menu gives you plenty of options.  I've been coming here since the place opened and the service still hasn't come around.  The good thing is the food is consistent.  It is good every time I've been here.   What I like about CPK is when I don't want to have to think about dinner or lunch I can count on CPK to be there for me.  I guess that is my feeling with most chain restaurants.  CPK offers Pizza's, Salads, Pasta's, & Sandwich's so there is plenty to pick from.   The interior of this particular CPK doesn't look like any of the other chain CPK's I've been in, and its smaller.  Unfortunately Fayza is right on this one, parking sucks here.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3?start=60
