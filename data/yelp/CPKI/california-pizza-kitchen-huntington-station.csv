Claire K.,"San Diego, CA",183,155,120,1.0,1/1/2016,"We were the only ones in the entrance yesterday and every server (busy and not busy) just starred at us like we were suppose to seat ourselves? A busy waitress with a back brace put down her plates, made sure they had everything they needed then came over to us. Following her, finally the hostess (who was one that just starred) came and took over. Beverage from the waitress with the back brace (wish I knew her name) brought us our drinks fast but then we waited 45 mins for our food. Wasn't sure if bread or anything was suppose to come prior but nothing. Jambalaya pasta was far from al dente but pretty hard. Shrimp was cooked well but chicken was really dry. The carnitas pizza isn't something I'd get again. Overall, we won't be coming back here. That waitress with the back brace should go somewhere else and really shine for her awesome customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-station?start=40
Patty G.,"Kendall Park, NJ",13,85,,2.0,12/30/2015,"My boyfriend and I came her for lunch the day after Christmas. Looking at the positive reviews I see many people are happy with this place.   It was just ok, the service was pretty good.  It was a little too noisy for me but that is the way the place is.   Booths are only for parties of 2 or more otherwise you sit at a banquette or table very close to others who can hear your conversation.  Booo.  Bathroom was very small.  Ick. We enjoyed the warm bread with olive oil, that was a nice touch. I ordered the Thai salad without meat/chicken and didn't realize that it had edamame which I can't have. I wasn't sure if I should send it back but I decide not to and remove it carefully. There must have been 20 pieces.  I don't think 20 pieces of edamame would be good for anyone but this is not a nutrition review or article about the Dark Side of Soy.  I see now on the menu it doesn't mention edamame , they should mention it on the menu.  It tasted ok, the peanuts and dressing were tasty.  My boyfriend enjoyed his turkey sandwich.  Coffee was good. Nothing very special, we won't be back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-station?start=40

Richard B.,"Plainview, NY",8,159,57,2.0,11/19/2015,The fact is this.... It is ok if you stick to the basics. More sizzle than steak. Pizza is ok but the restaurant food will never satisfy. Feels like Applebee's quality across the board. I am not discounting the challenge the servers face being overworked but this reflects badly if your hungry. Slowwwwwwww service and the sales pitch about wine or appetizers is uncomfortable to listen to. Stick to selling pizza.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-station?start=40
Jessica C.,"Huntington, NY",1,62,4,3.0,8/7/2015,"I've been to many California Pizza Kitchen's (CPK) and the food is good.  It's pretty much the same everywhere you go.  If this review were just about the food, I'd give it 5 stars for good taste and consistency of taste.  However, my three star review on CPK is SOLELY about the one in Huntington at Walt Whitman Mall.  If this isn't the location you're concerned about, disregard this review.  I've been to the Huntington CPK a few times now and it's so dirty.  When you walk up to the doors outside, their are hundreds and hundreds of hand prints all over the door.  When you actually walk in, you get hit with this repugnant odor.  I can't really describe it but it is terrible.  Maybe it's the carpet.  Whatever it is IT IS A TERRIBLE SMELL.  The bathrooms are terribly dirty.  I've been there at different times of the day and nothing changes the filthy bathrooms.  The overall feeling I get when I walk in here is that I need to immediately take a shower when I walk out.  This CPK is not welcoming, it's not comfortable.  The staff is not friendly either but I think the overall uncleanliness of this location is a bigger issue than unfriendly staff.  CPK has good food but it is ashamed that this location is so dirty.   Figure it out, CPK Huntington.  You're a gross place to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-station?start=40
Brandon M.,"Plainview, NY",3,136,357,1.0,6/20/2015,"The food is ok, nothing special. The staff is not good but they are not rude. I was asking for an empty cup and they never gave it to me. I just don't understand how come they cant give me a cup and napkins. What's so hard about that I just don't understand. There is so many strange people coming to the place it's really scary. I would not come again. Also they are very stingy with the cups and napkins. Also you should know that lots of babies small and big come here and in my experience A baby threw a fork at me. I never saw so many rude babies in my life before. Do not come here. It's Pricing is also not good at all. This is cozi in form of a pizza. The pizza might be gold.

Randi G.,"Walnut Creek, CA",42,46,29,4.0,10/1/2015,Another great place by the Walt Whitman Mall.  Same issue as other eateries over there - the wait can be 20-40 minutes depending on the time of day and the crowds.  The food is consistent as well as the service.

Nancy J.,"Huntington, NY",0,19,1,1.0,2/13/2016,"Horrible from the moment I stepped into it. Ordered take out pizza and salad 40 minutes before picking it up.  Upon entering the restaurant, numerous baby strollers were blocking the entrance.  Apparently a party was going on, but no one understood to move the strollers from the front.  Waited another 20 minutes for pickup.  Noticed workers seemed to be clueless about sanitation.  Pizza was being DUMPED out onto counter, Not Plates.  Was the counter clean?!  One worker sneezed onto the food as we were waiting.  Upon getting home I had NO desire to eat the salad, so it was thrown out.  The Mini pizza was BLACKLY burnt ALL OVER THE BOTTOM.  Gross and could not get rid of horrible taste.  By the way, YOUR HEALTH INSPECTION SHOULD BE PROMINENTLY Displayed, Not hiding behind a Lucite holder with brochures.  Not a good rating either.  Used bare hands, not Gloves, Didn't wash hands, etc.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS DUMP!  GROSS!  SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN PERMANENTLY.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-station?start=40

Mitch B.,"Nassau County, NY",8,77,12,4.0,12/15/2015,"Returned to CPK for a light bite for the first time since my May 2014 review and was pleasantly surprised.  Seems as though they've stepped up their game since then.  Gone are the stale pieces of Italian or pita bread placed on the table with individual packs of butter almost as an afterthought.  Instead, great pride seems to be taken in delivering lightly toasted slices of sourdough baguette with olive oil and herbs for dipping.  Really makes a difference.  Got a cup of the mixed split pea and barley soup and a regular size Moroccan salad. Both were excellent - the soup remains one of our favorites -  and unlike my last visits, the regular sized salad was a full sized dish.    The place was energized and a manager was very busy and visible throughout the restaurant making sure things went smoothly.  The dishes on the other tables looked great.  I'm glad CPK has redeemed itself for me.  The food has always been terrific.  Look forward to returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-station?start=40
Dominic L.,"Westbury, NY",14,86,271,2.0,12/11/2012,Food is ok. But this location had some major set backs. First the waiter comes to take your order without writing the order down.  Need less to say he got one of our order wrong. We kept it since didnt want to wait for another order which will take forever.  So the waiter drops off the food.  But does not come back to check on us.  We absolutely waited forever for him to come back.   During dinner we went to the men's room to do number one.  We notice one of the waiter had just did number one and jetted out so quick Without washing his hands. That is so gross! Totally UNSANITARY.  My kids ordered a sundae and the waiter gave my kids the sundae in a kids cup. I would recommend you to go to another cpk.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-station?start=40
Jay E.,"Massapequa, NY",1,57,20,3.0,2/16/2015,"Love the cedar planked salmon.  Hate that my waitress was lacking in skills.  Never bought the beverage refills which bothers me not to have drinks when the food comes.  Then had to wait 15 minutes once done with food for her to return without drinks so I can ask for the check.   To sum up.

Andrea C.,"Huntington Station, NY",72,45,82,2.0,5/15/2013,"While I haven't been here in a while, I have been here many times before and happy with their food and service. Unfortunately I cannot say the same about tonight's experience. It started off on the wrong foot when the waiter Joe suggested a caffeinated tea when my friend specifically asked for decaf.  Our food order was simple - 2 cups of the split pea barley soup, an arugula asparagus salad, roasted veggie salad with shrimp and a side order of pita bread that we requested to come out with the soup. Maybe that was too much to ask for as we had to remind the waiter about the pita bread and then send it back because it wasn't fully cooked.  The middle/inside tasted and actually looked slightly raw.  In fact, it also tasted different - more like pizza dough cut into triangles. We asked for it to be cooked more and while it did come back a bit more browned it still tasted and looked slightly under cooked - like raw dough.  Moving on to what I thought was a simple salad order.  I asked for my salad dressing on the side. And while they did give me salad dressing in a dish on the side, the cook must have slipped and put the salad dressing on before realizing I requested it on the side.  I saw some lettuce leaves with dressing on it but figured they started to put the dressing on then stopped. From first appearance the salad did not look like it had dressing.  However, when I mixed it up there was already dressing on the under layer.  But it didn't end there. When we were done I asked for a container to take home the food that we didn't finish and Joe only brings 1 container for 2 items. Common sense would tell me to bring 2 containers or at least ask how many containers I needed.  Definitely not assume I'd put the 2 items together. Needless to say I was very disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-station?start=40

E R.,"South Farmingdale, NY",7,104,1,4.0,12/8/2013,"I feel like I maybe shouldn't love California Pizza Kitchen as much as I do, because it's California Pizza Kitchen and all, but I do love it. We were just here last night, so I think I can accurately describe this... My husband really likes the Mac and Cheese Bites. It's his thing. It's a $3.50 +\- plate of four bites, and they're pretty tasty. They were hot, with a crispy outside, and a yummy inside. My thing is the avocado club egg rolls. I really like avocado, and I really like avocado, chicken, bacon, tomato, and maybe other delicious food stuff wrapped in a crispy egg roll wrapper and dipped in ranch dressing with a hint of hot sauce.  We tried the artichoke and spinach pizza last night. It was good, we liked it. We also like the California club pizza. We usually have good service, and we did last night though the place was packed.

I've avoided this place like the plague for almost all my life until last year when a few of my friends persuaded me to check this place out. Boy, was I surprised. The place is pretty trendy, nice and open, and does not resemble a pizza parlor at all. The pizza is actually very good here. My favorite is the Thai Chicken Pizza (pieces of chicken breast marinated in a spicy peanut-ginger and sesame sauce, Mozzarella cheese, green onions, bean sprouts, julienne carrots, cilantro and roasted peanuts). That spicy peanut sauce is soooooo goood!! For appetizers, I like to get the Singapore Shrimp Rolls Appetizer (Shrimp, baby broccoli, soy-glazed Shiitake mushrooms, spinach, carrots, rice noodles, bean sprouts, green onion and cilantro wrapped in rice paper. Served chilled with a sesame-ginger dipping sauce and Szechuan slaw.) which is very light and refreshing. Today, I got the Thai Crunch Salad (Shredded Napa cabbage, chilled-grilled chicken breast, julienne cucumbers, edamame, crispy wontons, peanuts, cilantro, julienne carrots, red cabbage and green onions tossed with a lime-cilantro dressing. Topped with crispy rice sticks and Thai peanut dressing.) which is very delicious. Chicken is tender, peanut sauce is spicy, and it's got a nice crunch with the rice sticks topped as a garnish.

While the location has a nice appeal , including some smooth jazz playing in the background, the food is lackluster.  I went with a best friend because we were right there and we needed food pronto after passing that window from hungry to ravenous! Service was fine but a bit harried.  We started with panko-breaded mac and cheese bites. Decently crispy, zero seasoning, frozen standard mac & cheese.  Eh!  My entrée was a Chipolte chicken pizza.  It was topped with a black bean salsa.  That was decent.  The scant chicken and the guacamole-type cream that were also on it, not so much.  It was a straight-up frozen crust, no bones about it.  My friend had a salad that she said was pretty good but it was quite skimpy.  All in all, it was okay.  I have no remote desire to return again.  There was also a notation on the menu saying something about bread basket available upon request? What's up with that noise? lol  Put out some welcoming eats and maybe folks want to stay, no?

There was also one large fly that kept landing on us throughout the entire meal. Midway through, we asked very nicely if someone might be able to catch this fly with a wet towel/napkin, which was chilling on the window. Ten minutes later, we get a message through our waitress from the manager: ""The only thing we can do is spray pesticides here while you eat, otherwise....""

All the pizzas sound so good (and they are) that it makes it incredibly hard to choose. I love the margherita & the sicilian & would definitely recommend both. All the appetizers are very good as well. The salads aren't the most amazing I've ever had, but it's not a restaurant meant for salads. If you're at a restaurant with 'pizza' in the name, you should just forget about your diet & go for it. ;) The only reason i'm giving them 4 stars is because of their service. It's very up & down. My friends & I had two extremely negative experiences with two different employees on two different occasions. They were very rude, unprofessional, and just didn't seem to listen or care about anything at all. One a waitress, & one a girl who worked the take-out register. But the other times that we've dined in, our service was excellent. Two of those times were with the server Justin, who was very pleasant & helpful.

They were also really nice, they accidentally messed up my friend's lunch order and they made her a whole new pie with the correct lunch order no charge and let her keep the other half of the pie that was correct.  I had the mushroom pizza with whole wheat crust and truffle oil. It was pretty damn tasty, just the right amount of flavor in all the ingredients. I ate the whole pie and it was pretty filling.  CPK is one of the few chain restaurants that I actually appreciate and enjoy. I think most chain restaurants are disgusting and usually only end up going when I am with a friend or relative that wants to go to whichever chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-station
Adrienne G.,"Queens, NY",0,7,1,4.0,8/15/2017,Hi  the service OK and the food was great we had a pleasant time here and we all had a great meals I would recommend this place for a family dinner. They were a little slow though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-station
Jared B.,"Commack, NY",1,7,,1.0,11/27/2016,"Very disappointed all around, won't be going back to any CPK ever.  I will say our waitress was kind and attentive with good service. CPK as a whole has been going slowly down hill for years... This one in particular is old and dirty, and hasn't been renovated in over 15 years. The food was just average... First, we ordered appetizers. My wife's salad had a bug in it. That was bad, but it was small, and wasn't the end of the world. What really did it for us was watching servers continually, throughout lunch, pull silverware out of a draw, inspect it, and polish it with their bare fingers. Cleary it was dirty, and rather then wash it they just rubbed it clean. gross  Then to top it off, we ordered a kids cheese pizza and a regular adult pizza, ""the works"". Our pizza came out mildly warm, and the kids pizza was scalding hot. We all had to sit and try to cool off our kids pizza before anyone could eat a thing. By the time that was done our pizza was cold, but we had been there so long at this point we ate it just to get out quickly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-station
Maria Ikiz K.,"North Merrick, NY",2,2,,1.0,7/4/2017,Awful service... Time wait for 2 meals more then 30 min!

Kaitlyn K.,"Levittown, NY",218,119,295,4.0,6/8/2016,"My only complaint about CPK is that the service is a little slow when it comes time to wrap things up, pay, and leave - and on my lunch break, time is of the essence.  With that said, CPK is a great environment for a delicious and relaxing lunch.  There is plenty of natural light and comfortable seating to share lunch with a friend (or friends)! I highly suggest any and all of the sandwiches!  And if you don't trust me - get the combo lunch, you can get half a sandwich and a soup or salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-station
Cephas K.,"Commack, NY",14,127,339,5.0,11/10/2016,"Yet another great place I found that's local. The service was great and our server Mark is awesome, the feel of the place is very comfortable, the food was served at a good pace and everything we ordered from appetizers to salad the main course and even their mixed drinks and the presentation of the food and drinks was really really good I highly recommend this place when you're in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-station
Brittany N.,"West Babylon, NY",296,26,25,2.0,7/8/2017,"Let's start from the beginning. We walk in and there are 3 servers sitting at the table behind the hostess stand. My friend and I stood  up there at the hostess stand for about 5 minutes until we were finally greeted. We sat down and it took about 10 minutes before someone came over. Before a waitress came over, I went to go over to the manager and him and the hostess were arguing. Not to pleasant for a customer to walk into. As I'm talking I see the waitress go to our table and give me a dirty look and the manager kinda just ""shoos"" me back to the table. Waitress was sweet so maybe it was an off day. Looking around servers are at the bar huddled on their phone. Just not as professional as I thought it would be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-station
Matt M.,"Austin, TX",13,32,,5.0,7/27/2017,My wife and I had Dinner here this evening the food was a 10 Plus the server was spot on she made me the best Rasberry Lemonade i ever tasted. the Pizza was spot on outrageous i definately reccomend this place it was clean the food was great the prices reasonable.

Michael O.,"Turnersville, NJ",47,15,5,1.0,6/24/2017,"Went here today for lunch, sat at the bar and asked the waitress if I could just get a slice. Very nicely she told no, but they have a lunch special with a 7"" pizza and soup or salad or  1/2 a sandwich. So I order the pizza & salad. After waiting around 20 minutes she politely comes over ands apologizes and said her manager said they are not doing the special on weekends! Are you kidding me!! Why is Saturday any different! And he saw me sitting there the whole time! What a jackass! Paid for my drink and left. Felt bad for the waitress, she was embarrassed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-station
Melanie L.,"Huntington Station, NY",0,2,1,2.0,5/20/2017,"I really don't like leaving negative reviews. The food is decent and the staff is nice, but the wait time for my experience this time was awful. I got here on a Saturday at 6pm. The host was a bit aloof. I would like to be warmly greeted but I had to say hello first. Not that I have a problem with that but it seemed he wanted to know why I was there without asking me. I would like to be seated please. He was a kid so I don't place blame on his inexperience in customer service. However, I do expect his managers to teach him how to greet a customer.  Secondly, while the restaurant had a lot of customers there were more than a few open tables, but we were seated at the table with direct sunlight in your eyes. The blinds facing that table were broken. He left immediately before I could address the issue. I simply sat at the next table. While I was waiting 10 mins for someone, anyone to introduce themselves as my server, this host tried to seat two other groups at that table. Clearly the worst seat in the house.  Ten minutes after being seated I was finally introduced to my server. He apologized for the wait of course. Obviously not his fault. While those around us may have been slowly helped before us, they clearly were waiting a while too. Slowly the water came, then the bread, then the chips and guacamole. Finally a bowl of soup came out. But it wasn't until I was too exhausted to wait for my pizza. I asked 40 minutes after waiting for my entree to have it wrapped to go. 10 minutes later and I finally got the check and my pizza. The host made it up to me by giving up some free small plates coupons for my next visit. I think I will order to go next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-station
Dave T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",415,258,12,1.0,1/1/2017,"We've been here before when visiting my wife's home town and it was always just ok but today's attempt at lunch was very sad. I call it an attempt because we never actually got to eat lunch. We ordered an appetizer and asked for bread. Got the appetizer, never got the bread. We were at the restaurant for an hour plus. We ordered a salad and a soup as our lunch. Never was given a spoon to eat the soup with and the chicken in the salad was frozen. After sending back the salad for edible chicken, we still sat waiting for a spoon for about 20 minutes and the soup got cold. Unfortunately we had somewhere to be and just gave up on eating lunch here today so paid for just the appetizer and considered it a fail. The server was very friendly but we have no clue how so much went so wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-station
Joseph C.,"Garden City, NY",224,117,51,2.0,1/16/2016,"Nothing out of the ordinary for standard chain food fare. Flappy wet paper towel texture to the dumpling wrappers. Chile sauce was nice however.  Probably mostly corn syrup.   The quesedillas were not something that I would order again. I would rather not go on. The spicy mayo accompanying the appetizer was very well balanced, definitely would be great with fries. The kids pizza was brought out almost room temperature.  The bottom appeared as if not baked? It was consumed rapidly by a 7 year old child. Arugula salad was fresh and certainly the best thing we ate. some ribboned parmesan was a nice touch. The Thai chicken pizza, our reason for visiting in the first place, was an extreme letdown. Years back you had thinly julienned veggies on top of the chicken and peanut sauced dough. Now it is basically twice as thick cut on the veggies,   ice cold, on top of a meagerly acessorized dough/crust. The great peanut flavor is there,  just skimped. I used to love this place too :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-station
Lauren R.,"Bellville, TX",0,14,9,2.0,11/13/2016,So while the food was pretty good we started to notice a few issues.

Kaitlin M.,"Babylon, NY",187,162,189,4.0,1/22/2015,"Love the pizzas here. Really good food for a chain restaurant. They have whole wheat and gluten free options, as well as fun and unique menu items, such as chile roleno, tortilla spring rolls, and thai pizza.  Good: I recommend the avocado egg rolls, the lettuce wraps, and the jamaican jerk pizza (or really any pizza for that matter). Drinks are good and you can get a bottle of wine for the table (or yourself). Not-so-good: The crispy mac and cheese wasn't warm OR gooey on the inside. (Whaaaaaattt?) So just stick with the fried mac at Cheesecake instead. The white corn guac lacks a little flavor, so you're better off with something else. Oh and they have the option for kids birthdays to make your own pizza which I think is a really cute idea.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-station?start=20
Andriana B.,"Syosset, NY",28,6,1,1.0,3/3/2017,"We had a hair in our pizza, had to send it back (obviously) and they didn't even take anything off the check!!! I am appalled at such terrible customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-station?start=20
Jeff S.,"Oakland Gardens, Queens, NY",0,12,,2.0,7/30/2016,Came here at 930 and the place was empty. The maître de wanted to seat us next to some noisy kids. We asked to move and she wigged on us. It was pretty funny since there were literally 40 other tables open. The food has definitely gone down hill. We have been to other cpk's and usually have a decent meal. My starter salad came a bit wilted and i had the Thai chicken pizza which was doused in peanut sauce.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-station?start=20
Miri J.,"Queens, NY",1,22,8,4.0,7/19/2016,"It is a great place for Pizza drinks and more. Maybe it is not the best Pizza, and maybe not amazing food, but it is clean, wide, and with service from great people. I am here usually Tuesday afternoon, and I have tried many options from their menu, and everything tasted good enough for me to come back.

S C.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,39,27,1.0,6/19/2017,"I believe his name was Andrew...our waiter...if you want to call him that...well might as well call him that because all we did was wait... while he drank soda and laughed with fellow employees. We had to ask for silverware after waiting what seemed like hours for our food (only to arrive cold anyway) then when ordering dessert he gave my husband and I the child dessert because ""i thought thats what you said you wanted"". When he brought the wrong dessert to my table i had to ask him to remove the dinner plates that had been sitting there since we finished eating. He first attempted to place the dessert on the only corner of the table that had room. Then when i asked him to move the plates he seemed annoyed. All the while the guy who i am assuming is the manager or owner of this shop is at the bar smiling from ear to ear counting money out in the open.

Ky A.,"Bay Shore, NY",46,50,10,2.0,9/19/2016,"Dined here this past Saturday night around 7:30 to get a quick bite and Sat at the bar because my boyfriend wanted to watch the Mets game on their TV. However a football game was on and when the bartender asked the manager if the tv could be changed my boyfriend said the manager rolled his eyes. Never got changed but it's okay because it's not a sports bar. The bartender was very busy but served us right away. Both ordered the sangria flights, which was pretty good. We then started off with a Caesar salad. Since the bartender was busy I asked the to-go worker for black pepper. He looked at me confused and said ""black pepper?"" I'll go check if we have some. He came back and said they had no pepper but they had red crushed pepper if I wanted that. Ummm no, but I know the restaurant has black pepper because it is a basic seasoning and necessity. Thankfully the table behind us was open so we took the pepper that was on it.  I ended up getting the roasted garlic chicken pizza and my other half got the chipotle chicken. Mines was definitely better!  While eating, we also had a lot of entertainment to watch from the employees. They were fighting with each other, making snarky comments and complaining. I've worked in the restaurant industry and if you have an open kitchen DO NOT air your problems out in front of patrons! Very unprofessional, but kind of entertaining. The people next to us was also watching the show and made their stay very short.  However, the worst part is this woman comes in with her kid who is about 5 or 6. They ordered to go but ended up staying and was about to sit at a table when her child started to cry and fuss. So what happened? They ended up sitting at the bar right next to me!! Then 3 young teens around 13-14 sat at the end of the bar! Not accompanied by an adult. I believe in NY if a person is less than 16 yo they need to be accompanied by an adult. It's not like I dislike kids, but come on kids sitting at a bar? Not what I wanted. The manager passed them a few times and didn't say anything, so I guess he didn't see it as a problem. This is putting the bartender at risk! This establishment should not allow kids to sit at a bar, especially when tables are open. Just looks unprofessional, so when we finally left the bar was filled with the 3 young teens, the 5 year old and his mother. Haha a bar filled with kids how about that? I've been to other family restaurants where a kid would sit at the bar with his parents and the manager would politely ask them to sit at a table instead since the child is a minor. Will not be returning for this reason and definitely will not recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-station?start=20

I liked the way that they prepared the food to perfection for the customer. The whole restaurant along with the employees working there really makes the customers get a jubilant vibe. My favorite thing on the menu is the tortilla corn soup. It is such a great, delightful, and delicious soup that I can only get from California Pizza Kitchen. I have had other tortilla soups elsewhere; however, California Pizza Kitchen knows how to make food because I only enjoy it there. Not only is the soup delicious, the pizza and salads are also mouthwatering.
