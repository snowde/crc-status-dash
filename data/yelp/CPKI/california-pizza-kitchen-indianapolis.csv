I ordered a pizza and a pasta and both were delicious.  I did have to wait at the front for awhile because the host walked away and never came back. All the other waiters saw but not one of them bothered to come up and greet/help the few of us that were waiting.

Ali G.,"Edmonton, Canada",229,952,170,2.0,7/24/2015,"While I didn't actually eat food, the rest of the group that I was with did. I was incredibly disappointed in how long it took for this place to bring me my drink order. I was very nearly tempted to leave without it as it was taking far too long. A frozen lemonade shouldn't take over half an hour or longer to be delivered to my table after being ordered, especially after every other person at our table had received their drink orders.  The restaurant wasn't terribly busy when we visited. The tables were nice and clean and the venue was reasonably well lit.

Tiffany B.,"Indianapolis, IN",372,821,1983,3.0,3/17/2015,"I first ate at a CPK in college in SoCal, so it will always have a soft spot in my heart. The pizzas are consistent, for sure. Come to think of it, I'm not sure if they have a thin crust pizza or if I've never thought to ask. If you like big dough, this is a good choice of a place to eat a personal size pie. I really like the grilled veggie salad, adding shrimp, but that makes it pretty spendy. I think this is mostly for the convention crowd, so they have some chains they recognize. I think the locals are probably still heading for Bazbeaux or Pizzology.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-indianapolis
Julia C.,"Indianapolis, IN",158,194,263,4.0,3/10/2012,"So the secret is to wish for everything you miss from home and presto it's appears. I use to go to CPK a lot with my peeps when I was back home (California) mainly to the bar for a quick drink and appetizer before heading out to the clubs (err, or club, as Monterey does not have very many :P). The one that opened at Circle center is VERY small, but still very much the same as any other CPK I've been too (duh, chain).  We went there on a Thursday  at around 2:30pm and it was pretty much dead in there. Not that many people in the mall either (omg, people actually work? :P), just a few suits and a couple with a baby. Our waiter was very funny and suggested we get the Korean BBQ steak tacos as an appetizer. It was pretty good, but I think my momma could whip up some better bulgogi to throw in there. I wish there was a Kogi BBQ-to-go truck here in Indy. But I digress, the tacos were very good, but it was just a hint of Korean flavors in it. We also ordered Jamaican Jerk chicken & the White pizza. MMMmmmm, bacon! I'm so going to miss you when I got veg. Dillon was worried that the pizzas were small and would not fill him up as he can put away at least 2 large pizzas from Papa Johns--or even 2 16' pizzas from Bazbeaux. But he started to feel full after a few slices. I think it's all the favors in the pizzas or maybe we waited too long before eating that day.  Overall, happy there is a CPK in town. It's a little overpriced, but really flavorful pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-indianapolis

There is very seldom a wait of any kind and the food is always delicious. They have a very large menu with a nice variety, many other options besides pizza. The price is very reasonable as well.

Tina B.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,6,,2.0,7/2/2015,"I was not super impressed with my recent visit to CPK. The hostess was seating us in the bar when the bartender walked by and asked her not to seat him because he was swamped. Pretty awkward considering she sat us in the bar anyway. It didn't exactly scream Customer Service. She also told us to watch out for a drink that had been spilled right next to our table. No wet floor sign, no attempt by anyone throughout our entire meal to clean it up. The other servers were standing in groups by the drink station or at the front, and the manager was even standing at the front looking like he wasn't doing anything. Meanwhile, the poor bartender was taking a full bar while making everyone else's drinks, running food, and bussing his tables. He still did a great job, especially since he was getting no help from anyone. If I were a lower class of person, I would have ""slipped"" in the spilled drink and collected a nice check. Instead I just ate some pizza, tipped the bartender for his hard work, and left. Probably won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-indianapolis

Aaron J.,"Greenwood, IN",0,7,,1.0,7/7/2015,"I've dined at this resturant a number of times, and most experiences have been good.  That said, I have one friend that refuses to eat here because she found a roach in her take-home box when opening it to put pizza in, but that's a different review that she can write if she decides to do so.  My most recent visit this pas weekend, left much to be desired. There was a lot of stuff going on downtown and due to it being a holiday weekend, they were short staffed.  There were 15+ empty tables as they were only seating about 1/2 the resturant.  They should probably seated even less.  We waited 30+ minutes to get a seat.   After being seated, we waited probably 15 minutes before someone greeted us to take drink orders.  At that time, it wasn't even the waitress that took the drink order, it was someone else. We ordered some soft drinks, and a drink from the bar.  Since he was underage, he wasn't able to take the order for the bar, so we had to wait for the waitress.   5 minutes later, the waitress showed up with the first set of drinks, and to take the bar order.  Despite being ready with our food order, she wouldn't take our food order. 20 minutes later, she returns to take our food order.  My drink from the bar had still not been delivered. She went to the bar, picked it up, and brought it over...it was wrong.  She took our food order and took the drink back to be fixed.   Probably another 20 minutes later, the food showed up, but my drink had not...so she went back to the bar to get it.  It looked mostly correct this time, however, it appeared they had just taken the old drink, and dumped it into a new glass, and added what was missing.  There wasn't much ice, and it looked watered down...which it was.  I just wanted to eat at this point so I didn't make a big deal about it.  After tasting it,I found it to be flat, and it tasted as if it was made with club soda instead of tonic.  Again, I just wanted to eat, so I drank it as-is. She did check back and see how the food was and get refills on the soft drinks a few minutes later. At the end of the meal, I requested the check.  They had charged me $17.58 for the drink.  A bit frustrated, I called the waitress back, explained that I had waited a long time for it, and that it wasn't of good quality.  I thought that for the inconvenience, that they should take at least half off that.  She took it to the bar, returned a few minutes later saying that they were unable to reduce the price on alcohol, but they could take something off of the price on the pizza.  I told them that I didn't care what they did, that I was going to leave it in their hands to do what they're allowed to do to make it right.  She returned saying that they had taken $2.86 off, 10% of the food cost. Understanding everthing that had happened, the pittance of a discount that they gave me just wasn't acceptable in my mind.  Poor dining room service, poor customer service...but I can't knock the food...it was decent...hence the 1 star.  Sorry CPK, I won't be back there for a long time...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-indianapolis
Samantha P.,"Indianapolis, IN",286,249,212,4.0,2/15/2013,"I went here for Devour Downtown and it was pretty good. We went during cold rain and kind of late so the place wasn't very busy.  Our appetizer took forever to come out because I guess the kitchen messed up the pita for the hummus, was a little odd but it was very good once we got it. I was surprised to see hummus at a pizza place! The server was also very kind and apologetic about the wait so that made it a lot easier. We then got two pizzas the Hawaiian and the five cheese/tomato. Both were pretty good though I think the five cheese was a bit better. I wouldn't say they blew me away but decently tasty. I also got a cocktail, I can't remember what it was but it wasn't very strong, wasn't all that delicious and way more expensive than I would have expected. It was probably the low point.  For dessert we had the chocolate cake, it was an interesting texture but very good!  Overall, it was a nice place to visit for their Devour Downtown deal.

Bill J.,"Indianapolis, IN",101,422,57,4.0,8/15/2012,"I went to CPK yesterday for a business lunch (client's choice) and was pleasantly surprised.  I had not been to CPK in a long, long time and I think the last time I went it might have been in an airport (?). Hostess greeted us immediately after we walked in, asked if we preferred a table or a booth.  Nice.  I like choices.  I really like a booth for a casual meal; comfort factor is superior. Server was at our table almost immediately for drink orders.  Delivered drinks quickly and took our order efficiently.  I ordered the Pear & Gorgonzola pizza....definitely a different tasting kind of pizza, but different in a good way.  The pizza is served with a mixed greens salad on top of it (placed on top *after* the pizza is baked).  So basically you're getting a side salad and pizza for lunch.   All in all it made for a very light lunch and it was very well prepared.  The server did a nice job of staying in touch with us but not interrupting our business discussion. The restaurant was not at all crowded during lunch hour yesterday....a little surprising given the location, but just an observation.

I suspect the new Circle Centre restaurant will be here for a long time. Great location, right in the heart of downtown.  The Thai Chicken pizza was up to par - chicken, carrots, bean sprouts, cilantro and peanut sesame sauce on a tasty crisp crust. Love it. Service was a little ragged for a weeknight.

One of the staff sees my plate pushed off to the side......I explain, and she is clearly astounded. My waitress comes over and suggests they will make another pizza. I was ready to bolt but she convinces me to stay. A while later a fellow comes over to my table, does not introduce himself or apologize. Just stares at me and then says he will take 20% off the tab.

She was very friendly and thanked us for dining with them. We had the BBQ chicken pizza and it was delicious!!! We will definitely be back again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-indianapolis?start=40
Mark B.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,4,5,3.0,2/8/2012,"If you get the Crispy Mac n' Cheese, you've already set yourself up for a good experience.  The waiter talked us into ordering the small-portioned albeit delectable appetizer after ordering both the Margherita and White pizzas -- and let's face it, he didn't have to try that hard. The Mac n' Cheese was brought to our table alongside our additional house salads which, too, were surprisingly crisp and refreshing. However, they were only a side note to the bursting flavor of the Crispy Mac n' Cheese.  I consider myself a 'texture' person when it comes to food so I was quite satisfied with the crispness of the outer shell especially when most restaurants with a similar menu item tend to lean toward the soggy side. But that's not all - the mac n' cheese inside the shell was some of the creamiest, richest, and moistest (yes - I hate this word) mac n' cheese I've ever had. The only downside is the portion size which turns out to be only 4 bite-size nuggets. If you're hungry, order two servings (we didn't have any hangups since we ordered two pizzas for our table). It would be nice if CPK increased the portion size to at least 5 bites, but I'm just nitpicking at this point. Now on to the pizza. Again, we ordered the White and the Margherita pizzas and both were good. As far as I'm concerned, I've had better 'white' pizzas from Domino's and Hot Box (The Big Cheese is the same thing in my book), but CPK's was good enough. I probably wouldn't order it again due to the outstanding menu choices which I also deem to be one of this restaurant's strengths, but my focus remained on the Mac n' Cheese (did I already mention that I liked the Mac n' Cheese?) AND the Margherita pizza. In the realm of Margherita pizzas, this was hands down one of the best I've ever had. It's thin-crusted, light and airy with the perfect blend of mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses that penetrate all the way down to the crust. I liken this pizza to a can of Pringles; once I popped (a slice into my mouth), I just couldn't stop (popping more and more slices). I highly recommend this pizza and if you are adamant about smothering your pizza in cheese, you might want to order extra or something else altogether. I'll finish with the atmosphere. As most people are already aware, this used to be Alcatraz - a fancy(ish) Brewhouse located inside/outside of the Circle Centre Mall. In my opinion, it doesn't quite fit into my normal expectation for a 'pizza place.' I felt that it was obvious that it used to be occupied by another restaurant and it definitely didn't have that welcome-to-our-extended-family vibe that most sit-in pizza places have. I sort of felt out of place when ordering JUST pizza as if I should've ordered shrimp cocktail for an appetizer, but once again I'm only nitpicking. Our waiter was superb and I never had to wait for a refill. The bathroom was quite dirty during my visit. I don't know if this had to do with the fact that it was the day after the Super Bowl, but the place was pretty dead so I'm going to chalk this one up to laziness.  Overall, if I'm in the area and have a taste for pizza, I'll probably go back... that's if I'm not drinking and closer to Hot Box down the street.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-indianapolis?start=40
Willie S.,"Carmel, IN",4,147,2,4.0,9/14/2011,Solid 4 for the first carry out experience. The pizza was good the Mac and Cheese appetizer was good to okay - the peach salad was great. Give it a try.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-indianapolis?start=40
Local G.,"Chicago, IL",0,56,1,2.0,11/13/2011,"I was in town on business and wanted to grab a late night dinner on the healthier side.  I've been to CPK before and decided to drop in to do a take out dinner.  I ordered the baja fish taco's (I've had them before) as a healthier choice.  It took over 20 mins to get my order and the place was empty with only a few tables filled.  No excuse, it's not like they had to kill the fish to make my tacos.  The fish is the only cooked part of the dish! Took my food back to the hotel, the tacos were very skimpy on the fish meat and did not taste fresh at all.   I was very disappointed in the quality, quantity for the price I paid and the unreasonable wait time to get my dinner.  I probably would've had a better experience at the Steak n Shake across the street!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-indianapolis?start=40
Swt P.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,124,1,3.0,9/1/2011,"CPK is a fun place to have great pizza. I am excited because we have a new family restaurant in downtown mall. They have extensive menu of pizza and salad, and many interesting appetizers and desserts. This place has a nice seating area that can accomodate a couple, family of four or six or a bigger group. I love their cobb salad and my husband always love the mushroom, sausage and pepperoni pizza.  My kids love their cheese pizza - it's the best cheese pizza for the kids meal. For $1 extra, kids can have a wonderful dessert. M&M sundae and brownie with Haagen Dazs ice cream are my kids' favorites..Very delicious. Big enough to share with the parents...:-))  This place has become a popular dining site for college kids and out of towners. It can be very tough to get the table if you go here at the peak hours in the weekend...20 minutes wait, can become 45 to 50 minutes wait. :-( The service can be very inconsistent too - mostly are friendly and attentive. Unfortunately, our waiter was overcharging us and we were not able to resolve the issue in our recent visit (may become our last dining visit too). Next time, we'll just do take out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-indianapolis?start=40
Andrea G.,"Indianapolis, IN",17,102,20,4.0,5/5/2013,"I've always been a think outside the box pizza girl myself so California Pizza Kitchen is a great option for me.  I have tried several of their pizzas now including the Thai Chicken, Pear and Gorgonzola and the Roasted Artichoke and Spinach.  They have all been wonderful but my favorite may be the Roasted Artichoke and Spinach.  All of their pizzas have fresh ingredients which only add to their full flavor.  The pear and gorgonzola pizza has a sweeter flavor profile and is a great lunch time option while the thai pizza has a really great peanut sauce that isn't hot spicy with a great crunchy veggie combo.   I will say that you may have better luck with their less traditional pizzas as I was not such a fan of their mushroom, pepperoni sausage.  This pizza was fine just not special which I think is what you are looking for in a place like this.  My group had great service and were allowed to sit and talk for a while after dinner without interruption.  Would return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-indianapolis?start=40
Angie M.,"Indianapolis, IN",22,95,3,1.0,9/11/2012,"Ok, I hate to give a place one star and I generally don't do it, but after two visits within the past week and both of them being poor, I am left no choice.  On the first visit, an individual in my party (of three people) received their order incorrectly and the kitchen manager was going to fix it.  I believe she then forgot to turn in the order to fix it so everyone was done and the lady still didn't have her corrected order.  Our waitress didn't even return to our table the entire time we were there.  We had to flag down another employee for drink refills.  Second visit... waited...waited...waited... seriously, how long does it take to make a few pizzas, a salad and an app?  Then, we ordered dessert, waited about ten minutes for it.  The employee said ""sorry for your wait"" when he brought us the check and then we continued to wait another ten minutes for him to come back and pick it up.  If you are going to acknowledge our wait, you might not want to make us wait again.  Grr!  We were late getting back to our office from our lunch break.  Probably have to say with certainty that I won't be returning to CPK.  Sorry, because the food is actually not that bad but the service could use serious improvements because they are not even that busy of a place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-indianapolis?start=40

Sunah K.,"Indianapolis, IN",30,163,98,3.0,1/12/2012,"yeah it's another chain restaurant in the mall, but it's pretty convenient, decent food, although the service is ht or miss.  i've been twice since they opened--first just a few days after  they opened--it was not very busy for a weekend evening.  we started with the korean beef taco appetizers--i'm biased cuz I'm Korean, but i didn't think they were particularly special, or Korean.  Our main orders somehow got lost amongst the few other restaurant orders, so after waiting for about 1/2 an hour after our apps, they brought us out another order of tacos, which were no better than the first. Their pizzas, of course are good--i almost always get the original bbq chicken, but i've had several of their others.   The next time we went, we were kind of in a hurry. it was definitely busier, with a few couples waiting in front to be seated, but there were at least half a dozen empty tables, all dirty, beng slowly cleared by what seemed to be the only bus person on duty. I'll probably eat there again if i'm at the mall, but it's not worth more than 3 stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-indianapolis?start=40
