Mitch B.,"Orange County, CA",860,126,392,5.0,9/14/2016,"This place is what I imagine Applebee's and Pizza Hut had a food baby. I got the lowest calorie/sodium food I could conjure up after reading reviews and online referrals. I chose the mushroom pizza with light cheese and truffle oil for an additional $1.50. Quite dry and just my luck, of course no truffle oil.  I noticed the salads here arrive drenched in dressing and topped with fried food so I figured try something realistically not bad for you. It would be hard to come here for a cheat meal or a healthy one. Baking frozen food seems to come out on point because the food comes out extremely appetizing looking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-2?start=40
Rohlin A.,"Mission Viejo, CA",168,802,3662,3.0,7/4/2015,"For Father's Day, I decided to a get a huge helping of ""cheese"" at Medieval Times and this past weekend I ended up asking myself ""Dude, Where's my Cheese?"" California Pizza Kitchen (   ) was a place I used to frequent P.Y. (Pre Yelp) and this past weekend the better half and I continued our current P.Y. renaissance. In 1985, two lawyers started California Pizza Kitchen pooling savings accounts and bank loans along with investments from friends to lease a space in Beverly Hills.  PepsiCo purchase 67 percent of the chain (both attorneys received $17.5 million) and immediately started expanding from 26 restaurants in 1992 to 69 restaurants two years later.  In 1997, Pepsi sold its controlling share to Bruckmann, Rosser, Sherrill & Company, who put Fred Hipp in charge of an aggressive expansion campaign, but the attorneys took majority control in 2003 after discovering Hipp had been inflating earning numbers.  Today, CPK is owned by Golden Gate Capital and in 2015 CPK announced a partnership with Make-A-Wish to aid in providing terminally ill children their ""wishes."" The interior remains the same, but a few years ago, this location renovated the patio area in an attempt to keep up with the patios of other restaurants at The Irvine Spectrum.  One thing that has changed was the wait time.  The last time I was here, there would be no way I would get seated right away on a Saturday night, but this evening we were shown a half booth table straight away. There was an almost immediate problem with the place we were seated, for some reason management felt the need to leave the doors to the patio open which was letting out all the cold air and letting in the warm air.  Apparently a number of children were running in between the patio area and the interior of the restaurant. Rohlinism: Much like your dog, if your child can't behave in a restaurant, he / she should be left at home or at the very least be put on a very short leash! After requesting the AC to be turned up, we were informed by the manager the AC was already blasting, but was able to move us to a booth at the back of the restaurant and you literally feel the temperature drop 10 degrees as we walked into this area. The most interesting change I witnessed was the change in complimentary bread from a hard French roll to a fresh sourdough (   ) with olive oil and seasoning.  The new bread is definitely an improvement from the one I remember.  The menu has changed slightly, but my wife's favorite salad (   ) is still available and she substitutes chicken for turkey.  I ordered a twist on their most popular pizza (   ) with a Strawberry Lemonade (   ) to drink. The food came out relatively fast, but sans much in the way of cheese.  Not much I could about the lack of cheese on my pizza, but Laina requested some more cheese for her salad and was given about a cup's worth.  Other than the lack of cheese, there was plenty of fresh veggies, protein and the dressing was really good too.  I think Laina really enjoyed the salad once she had a sufficient amount of cheese. I always had one gripe about pizzas here, not enough toppings.  Even forgetting the lack of gouda on the pizza, the other toppings weren't exactly falling off the pizza.  I do like the BBQ sauce CPK uses and it works well with the red onions and cilantro.  The taste is pretty much exactly the way I remember it ... with the addition of some acidity from the pineapple. The service was friendly and efficient throughout the meal and even the manager came over to make sure everything was ""ok."" I am not sure how CPK is going to fair in the foreseeable future with all the ""three minute"" pizza places popping up offering unlimited toppings for almost half the price.  We will probably return in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-2?start=40
Lena M.,"Memphis, TN",14,66,17,5.0,1/19/2017,"CPK is a restaurant chain but their food is great and consistent no matter what location you choose.

Mahesh S.,"Irvine, CA",807,382,260,5.0,4/11/2016,"Yeah, I know, its a chain, and you go here if you cant decide if you want a sandwich or pizza, but I absolutely adore this specific location! Irvine Spectrum CPK is conveniently located right next to the 24 hour fitness gym I go, on Monday, Tuesday and thursdays. I used to go to woodranch grille a lot after my gym for dinner/drinks, but when they hiked the wine prices just to show our protest, we decided to come to CPK, but that has been one of the wonderful decision we have ever made interms of eating out! the friends I work out with, we usually come here on thursday night around 7:30 or later. We opt to sit the bar, and the bar here is one of the best designed bar, its spread out through the entire restaurant, so you could never complain you couldn't find a seat at the bar. Its still some what manage to make you feel like you are having a private moment, as its arched. I like sitting at the bar looking at all pizzas they make!  Sam is one of the best bar tender ever, and she works here on thursdays and i have seen her on saturday/friday nights too. She is super nice. Makes our time more fun, always takes the time to explain the menu, deals. So prompt with bringing the bread and olive oil(soo good!) out as soon as we sit down!.  I usually opt for the california red wine flight. CPK doesnt sound like a wine destination, and I am pretty sure its not, but if you scan through their menu, you will find their wine list is pretty reasonable for a chain restaurant. During happy Hour ( after 8:30pm)- you can get a flatbread/wine at 10$. super good deal! I dont care for sweet drinks much, but they do have some good sangria(their new raspberry sangria - opt to get that in a bordeux glass, instead of the small flight glass, and the ginger one with basil -is really good!).  I also like their california club pizza(with double chicken. its almost like eating a club sandwich but as pizza. Soo good! I also like their kung pao spaghetti. If i cant convince my bf to take me to pick up stix , this dish is a good alternate to feed to my chinese food cravings! the best part, if you are going to the movies , always get your ticket at CPK. they still sell the movie tickets for 25$ - two tickets, + 10$ concession standard cash card. its such a good deal. remember the movies cost 13$. so you arent paying anything more, but have extra 10$ for diet soda, and a large popcorn. even costco movie tickets are sold at 2 for 19, so this is a really good deal! I wish i had enough money to buy and stock up these tickets!  Good people, good food, and to me its a happy place at spectrum!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-2?start=40

Vi V.,"Orange County, CA",281,760,3358,3.0,3/29/2016,"Went to grab lunch with my aunt. Located at the Irvine Spectrum across from the movie theater. Came around noon and the place was pretty empty so we got seated quickly. What we got: Complimentary Bread: bread is a little too hard for my liking. I enjoy their olive oil dip though! Lunch Duo: BBQ Chicken Pizza & Farmers Market Soup ($11): I've always enjoyed their BBQ chicken pizza, can't go wrong with it! Comes sliced into 4 pieces and might look small, but it's filling. Farmers Market soup is a squash kind of soup with olive oil drizzled on top. It was creamy and a little bit too oily, but overall still good soup! Would definitely get it again. Service: Everyone was nice. Kept coming back to ask us if we wanted more bread and to keep us updated on when our food was going to come out.

It was a little dark and loud during dinner time so not the best place if you want to talk to the people you're with! They switched their complimentary bread and olive oil/rosemary dip for the better. Make sure to try some. Yum.  I tried the carmalized peach salad. (Too many cranberries for my liking and the peach tasted like it was straight from a can) Pass on this one unless you like your salad super sweet.  The chicken added on top was seasoned/marinated perfectly.  I'd recommend the quinoa arugula salad (light and delicious) and you can't go wrong with the BBQ chicken pizza (everyone at the table loved it)!  The fried mac and cheese was good too but a tad bit too oily for my liking. The pumpkin cheesecake was a 7/10. Not bad.

Jane W.,"Baltimore, MD",1156,635,1484,3.0,12/11/2014,"I feel like chain restaurants are rapidly losing their charm, as there seems to be a growing interest in ""local/organic/healthy"" options (looking at you, Tender Greens). I visited CPK the other night for dinner and had an okay experience.  They start by serving a few slices of bread with olive oil (I had to ask for balsamic vinegar separately), which was rather unmemorable. I then went ahead and ordered a quinoa and arugula salad (comes with asparagus, sun-dried tomatoes, pine nuts, red onion, champagne vinaigrette, and feta cheese) for around $9-10. The salad wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly memorable. Service was friendly and efficient, however.

ALEXANDER should NOT be in the service industry. I could go on and on about his bratty attitude, but then this review would be a novel. I will not be returning to this location, to say the very least. The sad part is that we observed how he interacted with his other tables, and the attitude was the same.

Bebet Z.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",95,2,,1.0,4/13/2017,"We ate here last Saturday 4/8/17 for lunch. We ordered our usual favorites thai crunch salad, garlic cream fetuccini and some appetizers. We were there around 11am and we were the first customer when they opened.  We started off with the appetizers and salad. Then came our garlic cream pasta. There was one strand of a man's thick black hair - very visible on our plate of pasta (like a garnish!). We called our server and pointed out the HAIR. She apologized and brought the plate back to the kitchen and get us a new one.  Before we received the replacement pasta, she placed the check on our table with all of the charges inc. the pasta's (""for our convenience"" per the server. We did not ask for it yet as we are not even halfway done. Anyway, not a big deal.. so we continued waiting... Then she came back with ""a newly cooked, fresh pasta"" (according to her). So we ate... ate and ate... then my husband saw another strand of hair similar to what we found on the first one. ANOTHER HAIR!!!! I almost threw up. It was disgusting. We called the server again. She took the plate and talked to the manager. She came back with another check just taking off the charge for the pasta and THAT WAS IT! I mean, I would understand on the first event but come on! Another one?!?! Please have your crew wear some hair nets please?!? Also, you could have offered to make our meal complimentary at least or offer us a dessert but nothing...

When we ended up at Spectrum on a Friday night, we braved out the wait here and were excited to finally be seated. We ordered right away. The avocado egg rolls came out fairly quickly, and tasted standard. But my pasta...the pesto penne with chicken...was the absolute worst. The pasta wasn't even cooked properly and there were a total of maybe 6 pieces of chicken. Moreover, it tasted like an entirely different pasta, less like pesto and more like sun dried tomato flavors. It's difficult to explain but it was a huge nono.

The bar tender did not greet us, the man (I think Sebastian) working the front took our order. He served me water in a cracked glass, never brought our bread and then our food took 40 minutes. I was about to go in the back and cook it myself.  No one filled our water or asked us if we wanted another drink. The bar tender ignored us the whole time and she had the audacity to text on her phone with her back to us.  If the bartender Debbie is working RUN.... Or Sebastian....

We tried the Korean BBQ tacos... The meat was definitely over sauced/seasoned and tasted more like sugar than anything.  The taco, itself, was so small that I probably could have finished it off in two bites.... YIKES.  I was hoping for at least 4 or 5!!! LOL   For my entree, I had the Thai Chicken salad which was eh... but definitely over dressed..... GOOPY in fact.  The server recommended adding avocado which was a nice touch but i'm not sure if it was worth the extra money.  My fiance had the club sandwich on herb onion focaccia with a side salad and it definitely was nothing special either.  The side salad dressing was a tad too salty as well (balsamic vinegarette with a touch of dijon mustard i think....)

I shared the Italian Tomato & Basil Pizza and the Broccoli Sun-Dried Tomato Fusilli with Chicken. I must admit CPK pizza does taste a little better than most places, but still $12 for a pizza that is only 6 slices is a bit on the pricey end. However, I must admit that I did finish off my 1/2 of the pizza with no problem (and this is coming from a girl who usually doe not like to eat pizza at all). I would probably stick with the original BBQ pizza if you prefer more pizazz and meat on your pizza though...after all CPK is known for inventing the BBQ pizza (as it says on their menu). The pasta was okay. A little too greasy and a little too flavorless and too little chicken for my taste. After all, if I'm going to be paying 4.25 for chicken, I expect more than 5 slices of chicken in my pasta. The broccoli managed to save the dish a little as it was the best part of that plate.

Julianne P.,"Newport Beach, CA",3,8,,1.0,11/2/2013,"CPK food has always been great, and I go there for their signature BBQ chicken pizza & salad. Since they've redone their spectrum location, I feel their service has taken a huge toll. Our host seemed like he had a huge ego, who kept butting into our conversation as we were being seated. Our waiter, Kyle, had terrible timing and was too assuming. I ordered wine and it naturally comes in a separate glass so I can pour at my own pace. Apparently I wasn't drinking fast enough because he came by and just poured the other half in so he could clear some dishes off the table. WTF? He also forgot to add avocado to our salad, and when another server came out with it, we simply asked if the salad had avocado or if it was too much to add at that point. She seemed like she was irritated and said pretty loudly in her extremely annoying voice ""For $4 we can add it..."" with a little bit of attitude in her voice. $4? Really chick, you all forgot the avocado, and you can't even be nice about it. What a bitch. Like, seriously I felt like I had just asked her to kiss my feet. All this for avocado that we were willing to pay for anyways, but attitude did not help.  While we were finishing up, Kyle brought the check by and cleared the salad that still had a quarter left on the plate, and I was still eating! I couldn't even say anything because my mouth was full of pizza, and he was so quick to clear it. By the time I could say anything, he had already placed other dirty dishes on top of our salad. So rude, and too assuming-- as in he thought he knew what was best for us.  Anyways, the thing that killed me was that after we paid and were getting ready to leave, Kyle had just taken the drink order of a mature couple next to us. The gentleman said to his wife ""I DO NOT LIKE THIS GUY"", and when she kind of blew it off, he said it again, ""No, I do NOT like this guy."" Haha!  This is only one example of the service here, but I have been here plenty of times since the remodel and have noticed this terrible service every time. Next time, I'm just ordering food togo.

My overall impression is that this is the place you settle on when you're at the mall, need to please everyone, and are tired of hearing your kids whine. Not good. The food was, well... ok. I got a vegetarian pizza (w/o cheese) and it was decently tasty. The choice to put big chunks of baby broccoli, one per slice, made it look pretty... but be very awkward to eat. That seems pretty dumb to me. The prices aren't at all great for what you're getting. My husband and I each got a pizza, we drank water, and the bill was a little over $30 after tip. Not at all worth the money. Also, my husband and I felt super awkward every time our waiter came by - he kept trying to make these bad jokes/little comments that seemed like they might have been scripted.

Why the low rating?  First, the food is pricey.  Expect to pay about 12 bucks per dish at the minimum.  I don't mind paying that amount for semi-decent food (like PF Chang's right next to them - semi decent right?), but CPK is average.   Second, the place is known for eclectic pizzas.  I appreciate the fancy pizzas and the wide variety we have, but none are particularly any good!  To top it off, each pizza is going to set you back a minimum of 1000 calories - that's easily 1.5 hours on the treadmill going at least 6.5 without rest.  If I'm going to pay the price monetarily AND calorically I'd better be getting something good.  Unfortunately all the pizzas fall flat.  On a side note, Nordstrom's Bistro a few stores down has a far superior Margherita Pizza than the one served here - plus it's cheaper there I think. Salads are actually not bad - I'll usually order their BBQ chicken chopped salad with dressing on the side.  Half order is a little small for me but might be ok for others - depends on how much you eat.  If you don't get dressing on the side be prepared to get completely submerged by it - you'll be looking for any green.  I can't give this place kudos for their salads, however, because of the caloric count on a supposedly healthy dish - close to 1000 calories as well!  I have a dream, that one day, I will see ripples in my abs but my oppressors (red velvet cupcakes, chocolate chip cookies, and ""healthy"" salads) make this dream a darn near impossibility.  CPK, why oh why do you sabotage the washboard dreams of so many?!? Service is average - seems like a whole new set of wait staff every couple of months so with that comes the spotty, but friendly service.   Lastly, the bread is terrible.  It's like their serving Wonder Bread with some margarine.  I guess it's better than nothing, but cmon man - a garlic butter spread in lieu of the actual margarine might be nice. Sadly, I'll probably be heading back here in a couple of weeks because my boss likes this place, which means I'll have another marathon cardio session to look forward to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-2?start=200

My friend and I each ordered pasta, the Shrimp and Zucchini pasta and then the Kung Pao Spaghetti. I paid $3 for chicken on my pasta, and when it was delivered I found only 3 small slices of chicken on my plate. The zucchini pasta was extremely watery and there were miscellaneous pasta noodles throughout both our dishes (rotini, fettuccini).

Robert S.,"Irvine, CA",1378,388,634,3.0,9/28/2010,"Just what I need. More carbs for my expanding face. The thing I love and hate about this place is the variety of pizzas they serve. I'm not really a picky eater, so I made it a goal to try all the pizzas before I die. I think I'm about 80% complete and quite frankly I'm a little grossed out about myself. Some of the weird pizzas that I tasted includes the Peking duck pizza and the pear and gorgonzola. It was pretty disgusting. But there's other ones  like the BBQ Chicken and Santa Fe that are kind of different and pretty good. On this trip, I ordered their special artichoke, spinach, and mushroom pizza. It was okay. I just remember it being very cheesy. We also started with this spicy chicken quesadilla, which I thought was pretty good. My fiancée ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese. Easily replicable. Nothing special. This location is right across from the theater, so it's usually pretty busy and kind of crowded.  A little about my credentials: I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky, engineering image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian  Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes.

While the food is of course decent, it's not great and is just a little too spendy. It's been a couple years since I've been to a CPK and noticed some good changes they've made since. First, their complimentary bread and olive oil is excellent. The bread is warm, fresh, crackly outside and soft inside.  They also changed their pizza making process so that every pie is hand formed, as opposed to a machine they used before to form the crust. While the effort to move in a direction that's more artisinal is certainly appreciated, their energy could've been better spent having changed their crust recipe altogether to make it more crispy and less chewy, like something you'd find at Pizzeria Mozza.  In my view, you have Tender Greens, Wood Ranch, and P.F.

Whats makes this a 5 star is Arash. He was our bartender/waiter while we were at the bar and I could not begin to explain the amount of fun we had with him.  To start our night we found out P.F. Changs was going to be a 50 min wait on a friday night at 8 pm (no surprise really) so we decided to go to CPK for some good drinks and food. We were told there would be a 30 min wait but the bar was full service and had 2 seats open. That was like a guiding light from above tellin us where to sit for the good time we were looking to have.  My GF ordered a Appleberry Sangria (which was delicious simply because of the bar tending skills of Arash) and I was torn what to get so we ended up ordering a couple (which in reality was 2; 4 before we ordered our Hawaiian BBQ Chicken pizza on Honey-wheat dough) appetizers while I made up my mind. i settled on a Mai Tai and once again in Arash's superior bar tending skills, it was easily the best Mai Tai I have ever had (very tough category when you have one from Billy's at the Beach in Newport Beach). During the time of us enjoying our appetizers we were extremely entertained not only by Arash's wonderful personality but by him working the bar and mixing drinks for other customers of the restaurant.  By the time by my GF was halfway done with her drink, I was ready for another. Naturally I gave Arash carte blanche on my next drink with Vodka. After letting me choose which vodka I wanted, he contemplated what to make me. Shortly thereafter a wonderfully pink looking drink was born and in a pint glass in front of me (granted I do not shy away from girly drinks). Not only was it delicious but it was strong (it was a Cosmo for those wondering).  After those drinks and the food we were not only extremely satisfied but Arash pulled out some great bar tricks that left us laughing and amazed.  Arash was easily the contributing factor to us staying there for over 2 hours. Not only entertaining but his serving was top notch.  Not in my 23 years have I encountered a better waiter/waitress at a restaurant where they really make you feel like close friends from start to finish.

Surrounded by tons of choices at the Spectrum, we chose this establishment. The menu was again, altered with essentially the same items with just different crusts; mushroom pizza, mushroom sausage pepperoni pizza...it goes on and on. They have added entrees, appetizers and small plates but it has really gotten away from its signature items, pizza. All of the unique ones you won't find anywhere else are gone. It's just not special anymore or certainly doesn't have a unique appeal. The kids meals are fine overall. We probably would not go back and try something else in the mall. Even the bread was bland and not ""French"" style but more like ""white bread"" flavored. The  carnitas spicy pizza was meh as was the garlic fettuccine was bleh.

I hadn't been here in ages and just remembered how delicious their pizzas were, but after trying their new ""summer"" menu- I had to try a salad. I had the caramelized peach salad with chicken and since I wasn't too hungry- got the half with a strawberry lime margarita! Salad was perfectly sized and portioned, dressing was sufficient and the chicken delicious. Only thing was I had expected fresh peaches and they seemed almost like canned peaches or perhaps they had been soaked prior- either way it was good, but fresh probably would have been better! Our waiter was friendly- they had an outdoor patio that was large and perfect for large groups or parties. Only downside was how pricey things were and I almost felt like they weren't up to par with what was served (except the margarita- the margarita was presented beautifully but still expensive, but beautiful and delicious so worth it!).

Even though we had many choices at Spectrum for some reason we picked CPK to have dinner. What a disappointment for all of us and especially for me since it was my birthday. We got seated at 6:05 and waitress finally showed up to get our order at 6:40. That's 35 minutes sitting there to just get our order. So, I asked for the manager twice to speak with him but he didn't even bother to come. His name is Ryan Ross the manager at CPK spectrum location. He is very unprofessional in his job and very disappointing that we asked for him TWICE and didn't bother to come over to see what we want. I understand that sometimes you are busy but you can take one second of your busy time when a customer asks for you. As you know, people have a lot of options of dinning nowadays but customer service comes first in this Industry. Even the waitress was rude and unhappy.  Very bad experience OVERALL and will NEVER GO BACK THERE.

When I got my plate, the spaghetti noodles weren't cooked all the way, and were a bit stiff to twirl in my fork. The meat sauce also wasn't very pleasing. I was too hungry to say something (which is my fault). I ended up taking it home and brought it for lunch as leftovers. I warmed it, and the spaghetti is still a bit stiff. I'm not sure if the pasta was taken out too soon, and the meat sauce was cooked too long? But I was not pleased with the end result.

A few quick highlights: -they don't take reservations, but they told us that if we came at 5PM on a Saturday. Seating shouldn't be an issue as the crowds don't form that early -we rolled 18 deep so it was expected that service wouldn't be the best, in terms of timeliness of items/food/drinks coming out.  -dad ordered the ribeye and we needed to send it back because it was overcooked (wanted medium) and cold. Second time, it was way better -mom ordered the California club pizza and the avocado was kind of aged or at least showed some signs of brownness/darkness, sent back and the second pizza was way better. -server was really kind and patient throughout the night. We asked her to be successful in a difficult situation of serving 18 people, 11 which were children/kids. Kuddos for her patience through the night.

Decided to dine at the Irvine Spectrum location on a Saturday night before going to see a movie at the Edwards Cinema next door. We arrived around 7pm, there was only a wait of about 10-15mins for two people. We were seated and orders taken promptly, bread and drinks came out quickly.  We ordered 2 pizzas to share, and had plenty of leftovers. California Club Pizza ($15.39): This is an interesting pizza, feels like a salad on top of a pizza crust. I'll admit, it tasted like there was a lot going on in one pizza slice. Stuff kept falling off of the pizza onto my plate with every bite I took. It tasted good... but a bit confusing? Like a pizza having an identity crisis? Probably won't order this one again. Note to self for next time - finish this pizza and don't take home leftovers, it's hard to reheat because of the mixture of hot/cold toppings. BBQ Chicken Pizza ($14.99): This pizza was delicious and everything I expected it to be. It was savory and sweet and had just the right amount of ingredients on it. Chicken wasn't too dry, right amount of BBQ sauce on the pizza. Would order this pizza again. Overall a good meal, minus one star since overall the menu was on the pricier side.

The food did not taste as good as the other CPK's that I have been to.  I got the Sicilian Pizza and the Chicken Tequila Fettuccini Alfredo.  The pasta portion was very small.   The bread comes with olive oil now.  Ask for the butter.  It tastes alot better with the butter that they use to bring the bread out with. The refillable lemonade was GOOOOD!  The best flavor was the strawberry.  It comes mango, raspberry, and peach also.

Dawn D.,"San Diego, CA",78,69,552,3.0,5/16/2015,"After a frustrating situation upon arrival, when they did not have our reservation written down I was not expecting much. However, things went in the right direction after we got seated.  Our server, Melody, was very pleasant and attentive. She was helpful and offered a recommendation, which we took and enjoyed- the Sicilian pizza on the hand tossed dough was a winner.  PROS: Great patio, good for groups, fantastic service from Melody, cocktails (Bloody Mary & Strawberry Lime Margarita) were enjoyable for a chain restaurant, the Sicilian pizza was tasty CONS:  Blue cheese dressing was warm (I guess they served it in a dish which had just come out of the dishwasher), patio table was very wobbly, Cobb salad arrived missing very key ingredients, namely the avocado! (That's a HUGE error- a Cobb salad sans avocado and blue cheese crumbles is not worth $15 when it is served on iceberg)  Hostesses weren't overly welcoming- but it is Mother's Day and they are busy, so I'm giving them a pass.

They only have 2 small benches in the waiting area so 1 of us had to stand the entire 45 mins of waiting time.  Once our name was called we were seated promptly (The table was not preoccupied by anyone while we were waiting).   The staff was very attentive, our order was accurate and the food all tasted excellent.    If not for the 45 minute wait at the beginning I would most likely be giving this restaurant a 5 star review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-2?start=80

Ambience and service are both fine.  CPK has changed their bread, for the better I believe.  The bread & butter are complimentary and the new bread is more rustic and comes with olive oil/vinegar. I'm very picky about dessert and CPK has a winner in that regard too!  Cool, Creamy and Fantastic Key Lime Pie.  A delicious graham cracker crust, with smooth cream cheese and a great key lime flavoring. While they do have Pizza on the menu and in their name it is not something I typically get as I love a good salad!  When I have had the pizza I've always found it good nothing great but certainly pretty good.

I got the BBQ Pizza.  There are about 6 or so slices and it's definitely enough for one person.  The crust was fairly chewy, the end crusty and a perfect amount of ingredients on the top.  I finished it easily. My only gripe is I wish they had a few more ""gourmet"" pizza options if you know what I mean. Yeah, they have that thai pizza and their thin crust pizzas offer the pear and gorgonzola but I was looking for like a prosciutto pizza or a white pizza without tomato sauce etc.   Again, for a standard pizza place this definitely deserves a solid 3 stars.

An associate and I were working on a case and had no time to dine in a restaurant, so we ordered for delivery from CPK's web site.  We had always ordered from them through LABite until a bad experience the other day.  Moving forward, we decided to never use that service again. We noticed CPK delivered and charged $10 for a delivery fee, so we decided to go that route.  We ordered/shared the small plate item Crispy Mac N Cheese, Chicken Lettuce Wrap, and the entree Grilled Chicken Chimichurri. NONE of the food was edible! Every single thing was disgusting! We threw everything away after attempting to take a bite of the food.  The Crispy Mac N Cheese was so hard and dry, it was a struggle to cut it. So disgusting. There was no cheese on it.  How damn hard is it to put the fxxxing cheese on the damn mac? Really!  The Chicken Chimichurri entree was in a tiny appetizer type container. I have ordered that entree many times and never once did it come scrunched-up in an appetizer container. It had always come in an entree container; the way it should be. The sauce was half the amount it should have been.  The container it came in was filled only 1/3 of the way. The chicken was also squashed in the container, didn't look right, and the tiny piece we cutt-off to eat was tough and dry.  The lettuce wrap...FORGET IT! By this time, we had enough of this shit and decided to call it quits, toss the inedible food, contact CPK and demand for a refund.  The delivery woman was very nice and professional, but that doesn't cut it.  The food was flat-out disgusting and ended up being a serious waste of our time!  I was so pissed when I called the manager. Keep in mind, it took an hour to have the food delivered 2 blocks away. It was unacceptable for the food to be so horrible.  I could tell the manager was really pissed and wanted me off the phone right way, but I did not give a shit. I was the customer and you screwed me by serving-up this inedible shit. You don't like hearing it from people like me, then do your damn job and do it right! I refuse to settle for less! I simply want what I pay for; nothing more, nothing less!     He supposedly cancelled the credit card transaction; I won't know until the pending activity is cleared.

I finally asked our waitress if we could get the appetizers first. She said yes, but then ALL of the food arrived less than a minute later. Things got really awkward the runners put only half the food on the table and they took the other half back. The server said ""sorry"" but it didn't really make up for the cold food or our empty stomachs. Really, we ordered A LOT of food--we shouldn't have had to wait that long. I suppose we could have told her to time out the courses, but really a good server would have asked when we ordered it. When the server realized she forgot the drinks she ran them over and just said ""sorry"". In my experience it's nicer when the server says sorry and explains what's going on. Just a ""sorry"" is almost useless. Eventually the manager knew something was wrong, but we just saw him leaning on a wall talking to the servers at the computer most of the time. Would've been nice if he noticed those drinks sitting there for 15 minutes. Towards the end of the meal he came up and asked ""is everything okay here?"" and we barely said a word before he said ""ok good"" and walked away.

Cristine D.,"Torrance, CA",614,182,1359,3.0,2/22/2014,"From a taste perspective, I like CPK as a whole. However, the last few visits I've had at this particular location, the service has been on the slower side. Granted, I understand during high peak hours such as your typical lunch hour and dinner rush, it can get pretty crowded and you can expect slower service. But the last few times I've been here it's been off peak hours and the restaurant wasn't very busy. The other night we were seated, but it took about 15 minutes before someone took our drink orders. Typically, you get your drink orders taken within the first 5 minutes of getting seated. But whatever...that's the service I've been getting. Overall, the food can be pretty tasty. It's a chain, so it's a good place to keep in mind if you're in a city unknown to you and all you run into is a CPK. You can be assured, there will be something on the menu that should satisfy your palate. Obviously they have pizza and obviously they have these in California! LOL Here are a few of my favorites: BBQ CHICKEN PIZZA: It has chicken, cheese, cilantro, red onions on a thin crust Pizza. Maybe not your ""traditional"" Italian Pizza...but maybe that's why it's ""California Pizza Kitchen."" We Californians like to give traditional foods a twist and make it look pretty upon presentation. BBQ CHICKEN SALAD:  There's usually more iceberg though which I consider more of a filler than adding any nutritional value, so depending on my mood, I'll have them add spinach. They have lunch portion or full portion. Depending on your appetite, choose one or the other.  CARAMELIZED PEACH SALAD: This is my new favorite. I typically don't like much fruit in my salad, but this is tasty! Warm peach on a bed of greens joined by dried cranberries, red onions, toasted pecans and Gorgonzola cheese!?! It's like your taste buds are all satisfied with the sweetness, the nuts and the tart taste of the Gorgonzola cheese! COMPLIMENTARY BREAD: I don't know when they changed it, but they now have a spiced up dipping oil and a different type of bread they serve complimentary. I'm not too familiar with the different kinds of bread, but what used to be a simple white bread is now more of a ciabatta type. But that's not my point...I'm really excited about the dipping oil. It's got parsely, oregano, thyme, chili flakes and salt. A lot tastier than your average olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  So yeah, that's my review.

Gary B.,"Irvine, CA",72,124,27,1.0,4/3/2015,"First of all let me say that this review has nothing what so ever to do with the food. After walking through the Irvine Spectrum twice trying to decide where to eat, my wife and I decided on CPK. We hadn't been there in ages but remember how much we enjoyed the Plank Salmon. So we go in and there was one party that had just put their name in. My wife walked up to the hostess podium and asked for a table for two on the patio since it looked pretty empty. Right after two more parties signed in. After waiting a few minutes the couple before us was seated. Three to four minutes later the first couple to come in after us was called to be seated. My wife and I thought it was strange that with all of the empty patio tables available that we would have been seated in order. Though a little upset, we took it in stride. After standing there another five minutes the hostess picked up two menus so we started walking towards her. All of a sudden we couldn't believe what we were hearing. The hostess called up the second party that came in after us. And if that wasn't enough, to add insult to injury, as the party walked up to the podium the hostess asked them if they wanted inside seating or THE PATIO! Really? There was a second hostess that had just came to the podium, so my wife walked up and explained that we were before the last two parties to be seated, but there really wasn't much response. My wife turned and looked at me in disbelief, so I told her that we just needed to leave. So she turned to the hostess and asked that our name be taken off the list. With out a single word even being spoken, she picked up her writing utensil and scratched off our name.  We just turned and walked out.

Valerie D.,"San Gabriel, CA",62,103,108,4.0,2/16/2016,"I'm so surprised by the three star rating of this CPK!! This location is at such a prime spot with an outdoor mall as well as the movie theater that's across the restaurant, which is perfect for a date! Parking isn't too bad either as there's a few structures as well as lots surrounding the shopping areas.  Anyways, I came here for Valentine's Day and they had a 2 for $32 offer going on. Of course the items came from a pre-determined menu but there was plenty of options and the offer consisted of 1 app, 2 entrees, and a dessert. It's not too shabby for the price you pay, especially on Valentine's and we didn't have to wait long either! My boyfriend and I ordered: - Artichoke dip: This was the perfect amount of cheesy and hearty goodness. There was plenty of chips for the both of us but sadly not the right amount of dip. If I were to go to CPK again, I would def order this. - Sausage pepperoni mushroom pizza: This was pretty standard, not much to rave about. Thin crust and they were very generous with the toppings! - Garlic Alfredo Parmesan with chicken: Such a basic dish and for some reason, my stomach was telling me to get it. However, this dish was such a miss for me. My boyfriend and I both agreed the pasta was undercooked as it was a bit hard and pasta was sticking together. It was a pretty small portion too. - Key lime pie: I was pretty surprised by the first bite because it was the perfect amount of tart and sweet. For those who haven't tried it, it's like a lime cheesecake. Sadly though, the pie became less appetizing the more we ate it. Moving on from the food, our server was Kendall and she was really sweet.

Clara C.,"Irvine, CA",2019,776,2655,4.0,10/24/2013,"CPK has really improved in the last couple years.  I used to think their pizzas were really mediocre and pastas too oily or too heavy. When I came here on a Wednesday night, I didn't think it was too bad!  The hostess/waitress greeted us at the entrance and was very helpful with my question about their ongoing promotion: with any dinner entree, buy a Regal (just across the walkway) ticket for $8 + tax.  They are offering it year-round, and you don't have to redeem it right away.  The service was great.  Ashli came to our table many times to check up on us, even though she was obviously very busy (and she stated she was pretty new).  I was sharing food with my bf, and although I forgot to ask for an extra plate, she offered to bring one.  We had an offer from our mobile app, and she remembered to put it in the check.  I really appreciated that she got our bill right the first time.  (I find it pretty annoying when I am billed incorrectly and they make us wait while they fix it.) I had half of the Cobb Pizza ($13).  I ordered this since it was a CPK favorite, denoted by the palm tree symbol on the menu.  Although everything on the pizza was fantastic, my bf didn't like that he was practically eating a salad on top of the pizza.  The avocado and lettuce toppings are placed pretty much like a salad, so it gets really messy (they add light dressing as well).  It helps if you fold the pizza slice..  Anyway, the taste was great.  In addition to the marinara, you also get a bit of the ranch dressing, and it was not heavy at all. (If you've never dipped pizza into ranch, you gotta try it!!)  The cobb pizza was on the hand-tossed original crust (not the thin crust), which apparently is made with less sugar than before.  I thought the crust was pretty good - chewy, soft in the center, yet crispy/lightly toasted. They have a separate ""small plates"" (aka appetizer) menu that offered smaller portions at lower prices.  You could order flatbreads, salads, and other appetizers.  I think it's great for snacking before or after a movie!  I had the asparagus + arugula salad ($4.95).  It was enough to fill me as a late night snack, but I don't think the portion was large enough to call it a dinner.  The light vinaigrette tasted great - I love arugula, too.  The salad also had sun-dried tomatoes and even fewer pieces of full almonds.  I really enjoyed the small salad.  Just be careful with asparagus because it really does stink your pee.   I also tried the chips & guac ($3.85); there was way too much chips for the amount of guac they provided.  The guac had chunky pieces of avocado and too much corn for my taste.  This appetizer was good, but I wish there was more guac!  Portion size wasn't too bad for 4 bucks. There's also Pieology at the Irvine Spectrum.  The only reason I'd choose CPK over Pieology would be variety - if I wanted some salad, dessert, or pasta.  I'll have to come back to try out their pastas.  I think Pieology pizzas would be comparable to CPK's thin-crust pizzas.  I'd say CPK's is just a tiny bit bigger in diameter, but Pieology is still cheaper for a custom pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-2?start=100

The drinks came in a few minutes. Wife had an apple martini which she loved. My spicy margarita was just right. The kids food came out first. And then my pizza came with wife's salad. My drink was a great compliment to the pizza which was served with salsa on the side. The salsa and the marinated pulled pork in my pizza was excellent.

In fact, he brought my pizza back 5 minutes later at the same exact temperature. To make matters worse, when another server came by with a replacement, he was quick to tell her that it wasn't ours and made for a very awkward moment. Needless to say we were offended and will not be going back.

Thai Linguine has always been a solid call for me. Save this occasion. Sadly they decided to pour at least 1/3 a cup of soy sauce. What the line cook needs to understand is.. Soy = Salt.. It takes the sweetness of the peanut sauce and just kills it.  and sadly not in a good way.  Our weightier was weak. Solid on drink refills but during lunch rush for me to wait 20 mins for a pre-blanched pasta dish is just stupid.  The chicken on the pasta was cooked dry-well. At least I don't need to worry about getting sick.  ... and on a side note.. whats with the revolving door? I mean, if I were to get drunk there (not saying i ever would) how the hell do you expect me to manage that?!  It is very sad that the CPK next to my work has to be so... sub par.

They told us to hold on a second as they finished writing a note about something, then all four started laughing...what?!

Good thing is our server came our right away and got our drink orders! He promptly brought our drinks out...and we weren't ready to order yet...so he came back again, and again, and again. Seriously...he was persistent. He came back about 3 times before we were ready to order. I don't know if he was just bored or what...but he was sure persistent!  I ordered the Sicilian Pizza. My friends warned me it was tasty but spicey...and they were right on both! I loved it though....so good!!! Mmmmm nom nom nom pizza party in my mouth!! And the pizza is HUGE, you can literally split the pizza with another person. I ate 3/4s of it, and that was way too much for me...I should have only eaten half. But it was just that good!!!

Upon seating us, she said our server, Jonathan, would be with us in a few minutes.  We sat around for 20 minutes before we flagged down another server, Phillip, to see what the problem was. Phillip apologized and took our orders for drinks and entrees.  Later, he returned with our food.  So....where is this Jonathan?  Phillip ended up being our server that night. When we got our bill, it still said that Jonathan was our server.  How inconvenient.  We didn't want to leave a tip on the card because this mysterious Jonathan didn't do crap!  So we waited around another few minutes to give Phillip a cash tip on purpose.

flo c.,"Irvine, CA",147,775,98,2.0,4/18/2009,"Clearly, the economy has not impacted CPK at the Spectrum because a quick bite at the Spectrum on a Thursday night (at about 6:30 p.m.) turned into practically an all-night extravanganza. Okay, so I exaggerated, but it seriously took at least 2.5 hours.  First of all, the host said it was going to be 15 minutes. We were going to get PF Chang's, but the hostess said that it would be a 45 minute wait over there. Again, we were there for a quick bite, mostly because I had to pick up something from the mall anyway. So 15 minutes turned into 30, 30 turned 40 and finally, we got a table (for two, by the way).  All we ordered was pita/hummus, a smashed pea soup, and a bbq chicken pizza. That took literally 45 minutes to get here. The food was like any other CPK's, so not horrid or fabulous.  Getting the check was another ordeal and my final conclusion is that we're never going here again. Someone should really tell the host that he needs to be more accurate with his estimations. If he had been honest, I would've 1) been less annoyed and 2) not eaten there.

It was to my surprise that the employees who had been previously forewarned of our arrival were extremely disgruntled and made quite the fuss about setting up tables for our group. I ordered the California Club pizza and split it with one of my friends, since it was a fairly good portion size. It tasted almost like if you got a chicken pizza and then just threw part of a salad on top. Reading the description in the menu, I was under the impression that all of the ingredients would be baked into the pizza; however that wasn't the case as the veggies were fresh and uncooked. Post-meal, the servers informed us that they were not able to split the checks more than 3 ways (which wasn't what they told me on the phone). I probably won't be coming back to this location, not because the food was bad but because of the service provided.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-2?start=140

What was delivered was something quite the opposite.  The lettuce was wilted and therefore would not hold the fixings that I put inside. The shrimp was over cooked on one side and under cooked on the other. What was supposed to be chicken looked like burned ground turkey that came from the bottom of the pan and was unrecognizable. The sauce had opened up inside the container and was not able to be used as it was meant to be so the unseasoned burned ground turkey and raw shrimp had no hope for flavor cover up.

Pros: + My Hawaiian BBQ chicken pizza had flavorful ingredients, a crispy crust, and lots of melty cheese.  It hit the spot. + Service was fast and friendly.  Our drinks were always refilled promptly, and the server checked on us at sufficient intervals. Cons: - It is COLD in this restaurant if you sit inside.  Probably 65 degrees. - The quinoa/arugala salad is a little bland in both taste and appearance. Ask for some lemon wedges to give it some zing. - They've gotten a little lazy with the free bread/butter.  The bread was essentially lacking in all flavor and texture and had too much loose flour on the outside.

She did not visit the table to offer a refill or to ask how the food was. My drink was empty halfway through our meal. I finished my chinese chicken salad (which was yum!) and still did not have a refill. I asked another waiter that walked by. She found my waiter and told her that I wanted a refill. Looks like it just went through one ear to the other because she just went to another table and two. No idea when or how she relayed my refill to someone else, but 5-10 minutes later, I finally got my refill from someone else. She stopped by to ask us if we wanted dessert. We said no and just wanted a box and the check. She was very quick with this. What I wonder is why the other waiter had to find my waiter to tell her I wanted a refill. Maybe she was busy.

Amar B.,"Las Vegas, NV",62,29,126,4.0,7/8/2013,"You might be wondering why I gave CPK 4/5 stars. Sounds crazy right? Well let me explain... this wasn't my first time coming to CPK, I can say I've been here enough to have tried most of their menu. I've been to CPKs in Nevada, Cali, and Arizona and its pretty much the same rodeo everywhere you go. This CPK was no different in delivering the brand promise, I got exactly what I was expecting to get; a marginally better dining experience at a reasonable price.  I came with a party of 8 on a Sunday for lunch, called ahead 15 minutes and our table was ready as we arrive. Once we were seated the server was friendly but not overly inviting, we ordered the spicy chicken quesadillas for our appetizers. They definitely did not disappoint, the quesadillas were bite sized, filled with black beans, roasted peppers, Monterey jack, onions, and chicken, and they were served with a creamy ranchito sauce. The spicy chicken quesadillas are definitely one of their more tasteful appetizer, and my personal favorite. The flavor and quality of ingredients was spot on with many of the other CPKs I've patroned. For my main course I ordered the California Club with Cesar Salad, which is again one of my personal favorite. The sandwich comes with delicious and crunchy bacon bits, avocado, grilled chicken, and tomatoes on herb onion bread. The sandwich is a great healthy alternative with plenty of flavor! Not only was the sandwich great but the Cesar Salad was equally as great. My entire entrée did not disappoint, it had neither disappointed nor exceeded my expectations, and rather it met them right in the middle. As far as presentation, plating, flavor, and ingredient quality are concerned I got exactly what I was expecting to get. One of the great things about this visit was the speed of the kitchen. We received our appetizers roughly 20 minutes after being seated and our main courses followed a couple minutes later; just as we were finishing up our appetizers, to be exact. Although I would have liked a break between the two courses I had no problem with the fast service of the kitchen. Overall, the service wasn't terrible 4/5, atmosphere was 3/5, and food quality was 5/5 (based on brand promise and my expectations), If I'm ever craving CPK again and I happen to be in the area I know I'll get exactly what I want if I come here... I will definitely be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-2?start=140

Wei H.,"Santa Ana, CA",4,28,,4.0,8/10/2007,"Is it me or the avacado egg roll here extremely overpriced?  The roll was still amazing nonetheless and definitely an appetizer you should try if its your first time.  After I tried it, I figured it wasn't hard to make at all considering the stuff that was in it wasn't too hard to find and since I'm chinese, the egg roll was easily obtainable from my local chinese supermarkets.  Since they charge about 9 bucks for 4 pieces, they made about 400% profit, since I made about 100 pieces under 3 bucks at home.  Either or, something to try, and than go home and make it for yourself...haha...anyway, the point of this review is the food....so yes, the avocado egg roll is good, but WAY too overpriced. I love the California Club, the BBQ Chicken Pizza, and the South West Pizza.  All three are amazing and worth a try.  If you come here, their unique pizza is what you want to go with.  I reccommend the California Club if you love avocado.  Try the BBQ chicken Pizza if its your first time here as its the main favorite among a lot of customers. The service here was great and nothing I can really complain about.  They check up on you frequently to see if everything is okay and do leave you alone when you want the time to eat your food in peace.  This one is close to my school so I come here whenever I can...and you should too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-2?start=300

Genie L.,"Pasadena, CA",3,41,33,3.0,12/21/2008,"I used to work here as a host so I can honestly say that the service really does try its best, negating the occasional bad day.  The management is strict and tends to like everything clean-cut and by-the-book.  They encourage us to have a personality but only under certain guidelines; I would give our service 4 stars. As far as the busy days, Friday and Saturday nights.  I would not recommend going than.  The kids of Irvine choose this place for their 20-person birthday party, and the parents tend to request inside because they fear  the unforeseen weather conditions of the patio. As far as the food goes, I tried mostly everything because it is part of the training.  However, the servers have to know the menu down-pact; hosts are just encouraged to make suggestions and pedal the new additions to the menu. If you do not want to read on... I highly recommend the Grilled Vegetable Salad and the Garlic Fettuccine dish ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PIZZA:  --Yea (decent creations): Jamaican Jerk , Wild Mushroom (nice blend of mushroom tastes), Thai Chicken (really sweet), Chipotle Chicken (has a good spiciness to it), the White Pizza (instead of getting the Cheese), the Sicilian and Margherita Neapolitans have a good balance (Sicilian is really meaty) --Meh (not really worth it): Santa Fe, Italian Tomato & Basil, The Works (COSTCO is better), Mango Tandoori (I recommend this if you do not want the pizza very sweet such as the Thai pizza), Hawaiian, MPS, Goat Cheese, Vegetarian with Eggplant, Five-cheese with tomato --Nah (don't get these): Garlic Chicken (really dry; go for the appetizer bread instead), Greek Pizza (just the salad on top of the bread, no effort given to this pizza... similar to Libya's all-green flag), Carne Asada and the Tostada (you might as well bypass this and go out for a real Mexican Tostada), BLT. (the concept for this pizza sucks, just order the sandwich), the Tricolore Salad Pizza is not a pizza but a salad with a soggy piece of flat bread underneath (it is not possible to eat this pizza like you would a traditional pizza) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ SALADS:  --Decent (I suggest the following; I would  not recommend anything off this list): the Grilled Vegetable Salad is amazing (get this if you get anything, I wish I had the recipe); the Asian salads are good (which tend to be sweeter than a traditional recipe, but many think they are too sweet for the palate); Thai Crunch is the second best of the salads), the BBQ chicken is good --Stay Away: from the Mediterranean and the Field Greens; the rest are very blah (typical flavour, nothing really extraordinary done with the ingredient choice) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PASTA: credibly rich but I really like them.... my favorite dish in this whole place is the Garlic Chicken Fettuccine Dish (I'd bypass the pizza selections for this any day), Pesto Cream Penne (good, but the pesto recipe could be improved), sausage & pepper penne tastes like pepper, Thai Linguine is way too rich (it's like eating only the sauce... I'd stay away from this one), portobello mushroom ravioli is also nicely done (the ravioli are made at CPK which gives them a very fresh taste), chicken tequila (not horrible but flavour combo is questionable), Jambalaya is not spicy, Kung Pao Spaghetti is also very average (sauce is too sweet) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ *Sandwiches: are not worth it for all the other amazing places you can get a sandwich *Appetizers: Avocado Rolls!!! (very rich but unhealthily delicious), the spring rolls (baja and thai) are pretty good (they each come with their own dipping sauce); I've tried all the other appetizers, and they are exactly what you would expect from the name (they're all done well but do not have anything particularly interesting that makes them stand out) *Soups: they get the soups shipped to CPK in a big bag which is emptied into heated basins everyday; ugly process, but the soups are okay considering; not by any means healthy *Desserts: really average; most of their desserts are typical for a chain restaurant and is not where CPK shines.  I really do not like the red velvet; it tastes like soap, probably because they stray away from the status quo cream cheese frosting that would normally adorn such a cake (CPK uses vanilla bean), Tiramisu is also not traditional... it comes out atop a puddle of cream, the rest are average as well.  I would suggest ordering something from another shop in the Spectrum... go get some ice cream. *I have not tried the Specialities because I did not get them for free.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-2?start=280

Also, be keen on the fact that the straws have a bendy side, so you can sip to the side, preventing spillage when your glass is full.  Also, they lock the rotating door when it's close to closing time, so stop trying to push it on your way out and just take the conventional door just to the side of it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-2?start=280

Fred A.,"Orange, CA",348,84,258,3.0,10/29/2010,"I've always had bad service and/or bad food at these branches. Honestly this experience was one notch better from the rest. Due to the 2 tests I had to take for finals, I wasn't able to celebrate the 29 months I've been with my girl on the 27th (yes, I know its corny). So instead we celebrated it today, with 2 $10 CPK cards we got from the mail. At this specific location, they have a revolving door. Very inconvenient for people who are in wheelchairs or wearing backpacks (like I was). The place was lit up and I noticed there were a lot of people working. They all looked liked zombies, not smiling and walking around lifeless but when they gather up in the corner near the electronic registers, they giggle like loud little school girls. Anyways, we were seated near the registers with the giggling school girls behind us, and our server (Mario) was the loudest of the bunch. The way he served us was like he was reading off a script, so we assumed he was new. He helped us decide on a couple things and this is what we got: Tazo Awake Tea - it was given in a cute pot where you can steep the tea bags, but the water that came with it was faucet water cold. I didn't know how the tea diffused, but with a temp like that it made the tea taste bland. Decaf Coffee - when I got my first cup (out of 5 or 6), it came out to be really cold as well. Either they borrowed coffee beans from a vietnamese restaurant or they but a gang load of decaf instant coffee because this thing was strong in flavor. Served with non-fat milk on the side, it was great for a bold ""black bean soup"" - as I like to say.  Korean BBQ Tacos - this was on their small cravings menu. When they meant tacos, it was literally not 1 but 2! 2 small tacos taqueria style. I was expecting them to be big and full of flavor, but I tasted no Korean BBQ taste until you squeezed a little lime. Over all it was like an overpriced bland amuse bousche. Not to mention, they were really cheap on the servings of meat.  Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza - Mario said you gotta be a real garlic lover to like this pizza so I tested that. With big roasted garlic flavor, as I was expecting on my first bite, I found none... I was pretty disappointed in it. There was also onions on it, but you can only see it (not taste it). The pizza didn't deliver what it promised so this is one to stay away from. The portion of chicken was ""chicken feed"". Hardly any for those who didn't get the joke.  Pear and Gorgonzola Pizza - of all the pizzas I have tried from this place, this one is by far the best (which isn't really saying much). It had a good balance between the sweet from the carmelized pears and the savoury from the field greens mixed with gorgonzola ranch dressing. There was also bits of gorgonzola which I liked, but on the menu it said there was chopped hazelnuts. For one who eats nuts/nut butters on a daily basis, I tasted no presence of filberts whatsoever. The crust was floppy tho, it probaby soaked up the water from the pears. Apple Crisp w/ Caramel and Haagen Dazs on the side - after extensive research on where to find the best Apple Crisp, I found CPK to be at the top when I googled it. FYI: if any of you want the best, PM me and I'll give you my address. This thing was childs play compared to mine. It had apples, one of my favorite fruits and thankfully it was hot, but where the hell was the crisp? I was poking the top with my finger and it made an imprint. I was expecting a nice crunchy topping, but they literally sprinkled brown sugar on top, threw it in the oven, and took it out without giving it time to crisp up. The caramel wasn't hot, and the ice cream... pshh, they didn't make it so I'll give CPK credit for choosing a good brand to top off their poorly made ""apple dribble"".  Service was blah. Mario was gone most of the time and he was one of those servers that checks up on you when you're in the middle of masticating on your food. The bill came up to be 45 bux, and they only took one of the $10 cards. Pretty bologna, but  w/e. I gotta get rid of it within the next month. I keep giving CPK more chances, but I never get much bang for my buck.

Our server was pushy, ordered things we specifically ***did NOT ask for; when he recommended the items we said we did not want any them*** (are you kidding me?!?) and tried charging us for them, and was ballsy enough to also try to negotiate with us for 10 minutes about why we should have double orders of drinks because the ones we ordered aren't as good as the ones he likes. We literally just wanted to order our own drinks and food but he wouldn't let us. Then when we spilled water he cleaned half, saying he would come back, but guess what- never did.. We were soaking by the time we left the restaurant! Manager gave us one free entree card for up to $15. Seems like an extremely weak compensation considering we had a $50 dinner (biggest waste of money) and a REALLY bad experience.

We ordered the Pesto Chicken thin-crust pizza and a small craving order of a Meditteranean Plate. In my honest opinion, out of the two, I thought the Pesto Chicken pizza was the only thing that was worth it though I did wish they had more sun-dried tomatoes on the pizza itself. The Meditteranean Plate for it's price is not really worth it. You would be better off just buying the ingredients separately at like Trader Joe's and making it yourself for a cheaper per unit price.  So yes, the Pesto Chicken was quite flavorful. The sun-dried tomatoes gave it a sweet taste for the palette, which was one of the reasons why I wished there was a bit more on the pizza.  The service was timely though the waitress only checked up on us once within the hour we stayed there. No worries though because we didn't have any concerns and we still had enough water.

Jonathan Z.,"Cypress, CA",595,1179,1175,4.0,9/2/2008,CPK is always busy during peak hours.  It doesn't matter the location.  This location is consistent on their food and service is decent most of the time.  Try their portabello mushroom ravioli or their milan pizza neopolitan style with extra garlic.  Good eats.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-2?start=260
Ryan M.,"Emeryville, CA",783,912,135,4.0,12/3/2007,"You know, I have to give this C.P.K. some credit. Although myself and two friends awaited for about a good 10-15 minutes before being seated, the service was excellent. We ordered the regular pepperoni pizza and California Club pizza (which consisted of: avocado, tomatoes, lettuce, bacon). Which made it essentially a B.L.T. on honey wheat pizza crust. Although the lack of the fifth star is only because it's a chain, so I can't give it complete credit for originality.  The appearance is set standard to probably every other C.P.K. in the process, that's all. I have nothing else to say about this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-2?start=260
Chris L.,"Orange County, CA",17,26,5,5.0,7/10/2011,"Never had a bad experience here, they run a tight operation whether you're at a table, sitting at the bar (I mostly do) or getting food to go",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-2?start=260
Zac B.,"Oceanside, CA",38,123,11,5.0,5/5/2008,"I went here last Wednesday for dinner and received EXCELLENT service.   Our server talked to us like we were people, not just customers.  This is somewhat of a rarity, considering this place is a chain and you usually only receive service like that from mom and pop places... it was nice!   I ordered the Hawaiian pizza and, despite this being a pretty easy pizza to make, it was better than the average Hawaiian pizza; and it came out pretty quick.   Good (not GREAT) pizza, coupled with some good beer and friendly hospitable service, makes for a sweet place to visit for a bite to eat. CPK: highly recommended.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-2?start=260
Dan H.,"Valencia, CA",106,302,22,4.0,1/30/2007,"My buddy recently became the manager of a residential complex across from the Irvine Spectrum, so I anticipate wringing this place out for the next couple of years.  We actually wanted to hit PF Chang's, but there was a wait, and I don't wait for corporate food. CPK had no wait, and apparently they rarely do.  Our server was super friendly.  Everybody was happy with what they ordered, including the vegetarian.  I recommend the thin crust Sicilian pizza.  I've been underwhelmed by their regular crust in the past. $10-$12 per person.  Nowhere near the Ferris Wheel, so you don't have to worry about it coming off and running you over.  4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-2?start=260
Bobby T.,"Westminster, CA",158,73,920,4.0,5/27/2012,"first of all, read a lot of the negative reviews about crappy service...here now (Sunday) & it's 7:05pm on Memorial day weekend & my server Tanvi was off the hook...greeted us promptly & cheerfully then introduced herself to us & took our order...checked on us all the time & refreshed our drinks without our having to ask...it was better than most of the other times I have been to CPK...Manager, Jerry also checked on us on 2 occasions...great customer service...on to the food, ordered the Thai Crunch Salad (full) & BBQ chicken pizza (thin crust) & both were very good...lime cilantro/peanut dressing very subtle & not too over powering & enough balance of veggies, peanuts & chicken to satisfy my palate & pizza was good, not too tangy & just enough BBQ sauce to not make the thin crust soggy...perfect for 2 people...well done!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-2?start=260
Paul I.,"Los Angeles, CA",59,21,19,2.0,7/27/2009,"We decided to go out and visit my brother who goes to UC Irvine.  We have  tapretty big group since most of my family went.  We were able to find parking fairly quickly even though it was crowded.  The wait for a table was not too bad.  I decided to get the garlic chicken pizza with whole wheat crust.  A couple of others in the party got the pepperoni pizza which looked pretty good.  My pizza was alright and since I've been to a few CPK's around my house this wasn't much different.  The pizza doesn't stand out as anything really great.  It seems like it is always just ok.  I really don't expect too much out of a chain but at least it's better than sbarro.  I've had better pizza and I think if you are looking for something out of the ordinary, I would not recommend this place.  Maybe it's because I've frequented this place too many times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-2?start=260
JJ W.,"Yorba Linda, CA",1,28,5,3.0,8/3/2010,"It was our second time visiting this chain restaurant and we were not so happy with the food. Honestly the best part of the meal was the kids pizzas. For the adults, we ordered BBQ pizza, soups and Korean tacos (gosh..pls dont order this dish). We make Korean food at home and this is no where closed to Korean food.  The meat and the sauce were annoyingly sweet..gosh..I thought we were eating molasses. The service was good and the food came out fast too but the quality was not there.  Please forgive me if you disagreed because we are genetically different and so are our taste buds. The bbq chicken pizza was ok..it was edible but if you truly enjoy pizza, go some place else or make your own using Trader Joes pizza dough...:)-",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-2?start=260
