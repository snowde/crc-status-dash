Jeff L.,"Newport Beach, CA",22,271,2061,4.0,4/26/2014,"Caesar Salad had no dressing on it. Ok, it's better than too much but seriously, it was bone dry. Had the Spicy Chicken Tinga Quesadilla from the small plate menu and the toppings were a little sparce but for that price point I couldn't expect too much. The Ranchito sauce was awesome though and after I ran out of the caesear dressing that they brought extra for my salad, I polished off the salad with that.  Staff is fast and very attentive with food and drink requests.  Was dead at 11:25, then about half the place filled out by 11:35.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine
Clara C.,"Irvine, CA",2019,776,2655,4.0,1/8/2014,"This CPK is located in Park Place, close to Ruth Chris' Steakhouse and 24 Fitness.  Parking was a bit confusing for me because I couldn't tell what was roped off for Ruth Chris' valets..  And the lot is not huge at all. CPK makes great thin crusted pizzas, and that's what I usually get here.  With my bf, I share a pizza and a small plate (what they call their appetizers).  My favorite small plate is the asparagus and arugula salad.  They put just the right amount of sun-dried tomatoes, almonds, and parmesan cheese to make the salad so tasty!  For an additional $2, you can split the toppings on a pizza.  While my bf prefers the bbq chicken, I like the tostada and california club.  Join the CPK club, and you can get a free small plate for signing up for emails! The other day we asked for regular crust, but they gave us the thin crust instead.. It wasn't that big of a deal because I like thin crust anyway, but wish they could be more careful next time with inputting the orders.   I think CPK is trying out a new thing where they serve fresh bread when you are seated.  I never had that before at other locations and it was my first time here, so maybe it was just this particular location ?  I'm not too sure.  They serve the free bread with some herb-seasoned olive oil.  It was good, but feels like a little carb overload, considering all that dough on the pizzas.. Just saying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine
Tamara P.,"Orange County, CA",491,715,1671,5.0,5/15/2013,"California Pizza Kitchen has always been one of those comfort restaurants for my family and I to fall back on whenever trying to decide where to eat.  We seem to choose either here or P.F. Chang's China Bistro. Well as I've said before in my many other California Pizza Kitchen reviews, my daughter loves their Sedona Tortilla Soup and I love their Thai Crunch Salad, so that is what we both ordered.  We shared a little of each other's dishes and we both walked out very satisfied. We dined here yesterday and had very good service.  They were a little busy, so I was happy that we were still able to be seated at a booth.  Our waiter was very friendly and efficient taking our orders for drinks and offering our family their menus.  My daughter always enjoys being able to color her menu.  Not all restaurants consistently offer her something to keep her busy and help pass the time.  Shortly after we received our drinks, he took our orders since we are regulars and didn't need much time to look over their menu.  He offered us bread from the start, which was great since many times in Hawaii I would have to ask for it. Everyone's food arrived pretty quickly and were presented beautifully.  The food was great as always expected.  They can definitely count on us being back the next time we're in the area!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine
Alice L.,"Buena Park, CA",677,666,3002,4.0,1/10/2013,"[CATERING REVIEW] Almost 1x / week, my company orders lunch for us here. We always get the same thing, and it's satisfying each time! Thai Crunch Salad = I really like the dressing on this. A light Thai peanut sauce. Love the avocado + edamame in it! Sandwich Platter = Has a variety of California Club, Chicken Caesar, and Italian Deli.  I always eat the Italian Deli since I love italian meats! All come with great foccacia bread. They're cut into half sizes, so people can pick and choose to try more than 1 kind. Four-Cheese Ravioli + Mushroom = Super rich pasta dish, but really savory and the mushrooms are thickly cut and plentiful. You'll have to add mushrooms though, which in my opinion, makes the dish! I've no inkling of pricing since the company orders and picks it up. But if you need a sandwich caterer in Irvine, CPK is a good choice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine
Anthony C.,"Temple City, CA",838,678,1016,3.0,1/26/2013,"Came here for a birthday with 40 people.  Food was average... I like their pizza but now a days you can find similar thin crust pizzas for much cheaper and taste better ( I find CPK's pizza crust to be a little too chewy).  Although their pizzas do have a good variety of flavors. The biggest problem was that they wouldn't split the bill for our party of 40... I mean at least into groups of like 10 or something would have been nice.  It was a pain and hassle to have to push the bill down with cards and cash and I ended up having to pick up the short change.  Other than that the service was fine.  Additionally, the reservation for 40 saved us after being turned down everywhere else so I can't be too upset",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine

My server acted like my brothers and friends weren't good enough to be served. Her name is Kristen and she was so condescending and was not friendly at all. It's as if she couldn't give good service to Asians. She was only friendly and smiled at other tables filled with Caucasians.  She also ignored us whenever we'd make eye contact and raise our hands for more water or for more help.  To make it worse, she charged me extra for a free appetizer when she clearly stated she would do it. After, the manager who helped with my refund was patronizing and treated me like a 5 year old.

Rosemary T.,"Tustin, CA",532,678,2406,3.0,5/20/2013,"Would be getting 4 stars, but service SUCKS!  Even though the bread is free, you gotta ask the server for it; otherwise, they won't serve it to you.  Favorite: 1. Lettuce cup with chicken - the crunchiness from one of the veggies inside is a perfect crunch that goes with the rest of the stuffing inside. Got it without the rice noodles b.c. they taste like styrofoam. Ask for extra lettuce cause they never give you enough.  2. Kao Pao Spagetti - sounds weird? that's cause you haven't tried it it. Chicken and peanuts cooked in spicy oil and tossed with spaghetti... perfect for days when you're craving for both Asian & Italian.  3. Wadrof Chicken Salad - the best salad on the menu. Different greens all toss together with chicken, grapes, blue cheese, and walnut~ yummy!  Get the vinaigrette, that's the best dressing they got! Tip: Ask for bread or you wont' get any~",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine
Mai N.,"Irvine, CA",469,479,1252,3.0,8/2/2011,"Service was very average.  We had to ask for water, bread & butter, and had to track down the waitress so we could order even though it was late and it wasn't very crowded. Ordered mac and cheese balls and chicken quesadilla small bites to start.  Both were pretty good.  The deep fried mac and cheese was very cheesy and delicious.  Then we ordered chipotle pizza and broccoli sun-dried tomato fusilli.  This pizza is one of my favorites; it has a very nice spicy kick to it.  The pasta was decent.  Nothing amazing but not bad either.   Cpk is a go to restaurant where you know the food will be decent.  Some locations have better service though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine

A group of three girls ordered a thai crunch salad full size plus avocado and buffalo chicken pizza. The meal is filling enough for us (since there's also bread served beforehand). The two dishes were a good combo.  What was good about the place was the FAST service. Everything was quick. If you want to get in and get out this is your place.

Seraph L.,"Alhambra, CA",295,222,49,4.0,10/29/2012,"NOOOOOOOOOO. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. THEY STOPPED MAKING THE CHICKEN AND GARLIC PIZZA. I WAS SO CRUSHED. I'd come here with my friend thinking that I was going to get the garlic chicken pizza, but I couldn't find it on the menu. I asked the waiter when he came around with our waters, and he told us that they were no longer making it. The good thing is that we found out that day that you can add onions and garlic on your pizza for free! So, feeling less devastated, we decided to go meaty and got the Meat Craver's pizza, and added garlic on top. We also got the Tuscan Hummus, which I quite enjoy. The food was yummy and service was prompt. I did think that the crust was a little too thin for my liking, but it was perfectly baked and just the right amount of crispy, so that's a bonus. Our waiter was really nice and really fast. We came in for a quick lunch and we got just that. We left satisfied.

Rain F.,"Reno, NV",247,711,906,3.0,2/2/2012,"Came here for dinner since we were in the area and I had a giftcard. It was an early and it was a weekday so they weren't too busy. The host was busy with his thick textbook -- reminded me of West's Business Law. So we got seated and asked for drinks.  I was curious with the Italian sodas so I ordered a Peach one. It came with too much ice (refer to pic) and tasted like 7up/Sprite with peach flavoring. We ordered two pizzas, Habanero and thin crust Sicilian. How is it that their thin crust is more expensive than regular crust? When the pizzas arrived, the thin crust appeared to be larger than the regular. Habanero was nothing to rave about until you add the sauce/salsa that comes with it. Oh so spicy and yet just the right kick the pizza needed. The Sicilian wasn't as exciting. Slices of meat thicker than the crust itself seems like an accurate description. I don't think I'd ever be a fan of thin crust. Service was good. Didn't even have to ask for refills as the server just comes with a new glass. Wondered what she would have done if I refused it. $40 for two pizzas and two drinks?

The wait staff was great! Friendly, attentive and had a great customer service attitude.  And the orders were delivered in a timely fashion.  What I also thought was smart, was instead of having one bill for all of us or breaking it into the 2 separate bills for the two tables, the waitress compartmentalized the entire bill to only 8 people's orders per bill and by doing so, it was less hectic at the end of the evening.  Also, once the sun went down and the evening became cooler, the heat lamps were turned on. I don't doubt many of us appreciated it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine
Sasha B.,"Miami, FL",0,64,5,2.0,3/9/2014,"While staying at a hotel in Irvine, the evening of 3/9/14 we ordered for delivery a Margherita pizza in the only size offered. We were quoted $14.03 (inc. tax) for the pizza + the outrageous sum of $10.00 for delivery.  Not having a car, we agreed to the total cost of $24.03.  Delivery was sooner than expected; plates, napkins and plastic silverware were provided as well as 4 pieces of bread and olive oil for dipping. The delivery guy left, but immediately returned to inform us the total was $14.83 and that the amount we gave him was 80 cents short.  I have in front of me the note I wrote when I placed my phone order, their clerk clearly said $14.03 for the pizza + $10.00 for delivery for a grand total of $24.03 and I repeated this back to her.  I have no idea how the delivery guy came up with a shortage of 80 cents, but we paid. We immediately proceeded to serve the pizza and found it to be completely, totally and disgustingly cold.  Not lukewarm, but cold almost like pizza out of a refrigerator.  This hotel room has a small microwave, but we're not fans of microwaved pizza so we ate it cold.  Unfortunately, we paid cash so we had no recourse but to 'eat' the loss. I called and spoke to Lacy who said she was the manager.  I asked if their pizzas are placed inside insulated transport bags like Domino's uses, she said they use those bags but that perhaps our delivery guy took it out of the bag once he arrived at our lot.  It shouldn't take more than 5 minutes to walk from the hotel lobby to our room, so I can't see how a 5 minute walk could cause a hot pizza to suddenly become cold.  I told her they need to review this policy and that the insulated bag should be used up until the moment of delivery.  I also mentioned the 80 cent discrepancy. The pizza was edible and I'd classify it as good but, who enjoys eating cold pizza?  We're very, very disappointed with this expensive experience, it's our first time ordering delivery from this chain.  I don't know if charging the outrageous sum of $10.00 for delivery of a $12.99 pizza is a California thing or if this is a common occurrence with this chain.  I don't plan on ordering takeout from this chain ever again.  By the way, I called Domino's after-the-fact to ask about the cost of its delivery, it's $2.50.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine

I ordered the Baja Chicken Tortilla rolls and the Thai Chicken rolls. I ordered it because I wanted chicken. They should rename it Baja Tortilla Roll etc. Take a look at my photo.

Tammy L.,"Lake Forest, CA",321,914,575,3.0,2/19/2009,"Readers, I don't frequent chain restaurants very often but when I do, I make sure to keep my expectations in check.  Today, I decided to order takeout because they would give 20% of my tab to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.  So I called in orders for myself and my coworkers and off I went to pick up our food. (Side note: People, if you're not going to be there for 15 minutes or less, please refrain from filling up the curbside service or takeout parking space!!) The takeout counter which is to the right of the hostess stand provides an easy convenient space to pick up orders and place orders.  The guys running the counter were very helpful and nice.  The food was ready when we got there and bread was offered and accepted. I had their grilled vegetable salad which sounds great on paper - grilled eggplant, grilled zucchini and asparagus served warm over romaine lettuce and topped with avocado chunks and toss with a dijon vinaigrette.  With the avo, the salad got ... mushy...when you stirred it up.  Flavor was as expected, nothing mind boggling.  I'm not normally a fast eater but my workload combined with the uninspired food fare allowed me to shove half my salad down my gullet in record time. My friend's chicken tequila fettuccine was standard/tasty.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and properly seasoned. Biggest highlight of lunch: Butter that was provided with the bread service was delightfully room temperature which made it very spreadable. Final assessment: Service, speediness of takeout and the butter were all 4-star worthy.  The standard fare drops it to a solid 3.

Nate H.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",26,40,5,4.0,1/20/2012,"Came here on a slow Monday night with a group of 9. Had pretty decent dinner. I'll start with the positives. Service was speedy and our food for the entire table was up in about 10 minutes. Good thing, cuz we were hungry. The thai spring rolls were very flavorful although some may think the sauces are a little too salty. Spinach and artichoke dip was warm and cheesy. Tortilla and mushroom soup was good too. And if you are in the mood for dessert, order the tiramisu, best one I've had at a restaraunt. It saved this restaraunt from being 3 stars in my book. Negatives: I ordered the gorgonzola and pear pizza with the wheat crust. Bland bland bland. I was craving the gorgonzola, but didn't really taste it anywhere. I surely could taste the roasted hazelnuts though, which didn't really fly with me. At least the crust was a nice texture. Our waitress didn't seem too happy to be there either. Walked around with a stern look glued to her face. Maybe we just caught her on a bad night. Overall none of the food was too stand out excellent for the evening. Also a suggestion for the restaraunt: invest in some heating elements above the food for when it comes out of the oven. If it sits on a cold counter top in an air conditioned building it's going to get real cold real fast before it hits the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine?start=60

I must say that I do like the set up of this particular branch. Their format is systematic and effective. In which they should, since they have to partake in a volley of mass lunch rushes everyday. From the white collar folk to the UCI students to Irvine residents, they can get you in and out without feeling like your share of service was shortchanged... What I do find to my liking is that they now have nutrition facts available for the calorie conscious individuals. Very nice. On the day I went here, I ordered a roasted artichoke spinach pizza and a traditional cheese (for the little one). At 10:30 am, we were just in time before the rush.

I've come here with 1-30 people, for big parties they'll seat you in the back and still be quick with your orders.  You can also be as loud as you want which is good to hear.  The service is always good.  And actually, I've had the service be a BIT slow a couple of times and both times, the manager's randomly come out and just given me any complimentary dessert of my choice.  Now that's how you work it. I love the Santa Fe Chicken Pizza, probably because I just LOVE sour cream, salsa, and guacamole.  The BBQ chicken's a classic but gets old.  My friend loves the avocado egg rolls.  The dumpling sauce makes it that much better, the cobb salad is delicious, so's the pastas...okay, I just love this place.  CPK FOR LIFE.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine?start=60

Taryn H.,"LADERA RANCH, CA",0,2,,4.0,10/10/2013,"Located across the globe there are about 256 working restaurants filling the hungry stomachs of all ages. California Pizza Kitchen is a casual setting fit for family dinners to a night out on the town. The sit down restaurant has lots of light with large windows and famous pictures of pizza framed and hung around the booths to create conversation with anyone. If your looking for a quick drink and an appetizer there is an option of the bar that sits across from the kitchen so you could smell the mouthwatering food that is placed on a metal shelf waiting to be served. If not there is also a selection of outside seating, booths, or tables to choose from.   The menu consists of multiple pages categorized into pizza, pasta, salad and much more. With all these options it's almost impossible to choose from but there's nothing better than the soft crust of the tostada pizza. Layers of black beans, fresh romaine lettuce, tomatoes and crisp chips all make up this signature dish. It's a hearty mix of salad and pizza warmed to perfection making sure to fulfill your every craving. If all of that isn't enough there is an option of adding slow roasted chicken with a taint layer of sweet barbeque sauce. All of this served cut into 8 slices to share.  To refresh yourself make sure to order the Shirley temple crusted with soft sugar and topped with a cherry or even two if you're lucky. This drink is just the right thing to clean your palate to get ready for dessert. There are about 8 different desserts to choose from including Tiramisu, Butter Cake and sugary Red Velvet Cake but if you ask any server they recommend the Butter Cake and so would I. This dish is something I could eat every day for breakfast lunch and dinner if it wasn't for the massive amount of calories. The calories are well worth it though! The warm cake is moist and spongy baked to perfection and laced with, what other than butter! Served with a scoop of none other than vanilla ice cream that drips down the hot cake and melts in your mouth. This is something you can't pass up!

Lance H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",22,373,36,3.0,11/24/2010,"California Pizza is a safe standby place. It is not anything special but is easy to eat and appeals to a lot of different people. This location is off of Jamboree and 405, close to Ruth Chris Steakhouse. Parking here is stupid.  The interior is the mirror of any other CPK; the place is usually clean and spacious. The kitchen is open so you can see the wood fired ovens. whoopie! (add sarcasm).  The staff are friendly but sometimes spacey. Overall good customer service.  The food as stated before is not anything special but there are a lot of options. The pizza are easily big enough to split with someone. For health conscious people, they do have nutrition information available but just like every other restaurant, it is brutal. I enjoy the field greens salad and BBQ chicken pizza. The tostada pizza is also good.  Price is OK. I am usually satisfied when leaving but could probably get the same for cheaper somewhere else.  Overall, I come to CPK occasionally but not a regular.

Also, they are best when they are hot.  Hot women and hot pizza?  Score. Third, if you have the cash you can always order them to come to your door and discard them when you're done.   When you have too much of one you quickly get sick of it and start to look at other options.

Chris C.,"Washington, DC",627,473,255,3.0,10/15/2010,"Not sure what happened, but last time we were here we ordered a BBQ chicken pizza and it seemed considerably smaller than usual. I know I have a big appetite, but I don't think its me...I think the pizza really did get smaller. I've also noticed that the prices have gone up at least a couple dollars per pizza in the past couple years. I know pizza ingredients have gotten more expensive lately and so the cost of producing a pizza may has gone up, but I don't always necessarily feel like I'm getting my money's worth when I'm coming here. The food is good, but I expect a little more from a place that costs $40-50 for two people to eat.  However, I must say that the peach lemonade here is one of my favorite drinks at a sit-down restaurant besides the freckled lemoade from Red Robin. The chipotle chicken pizza, the california club, and the BBQ chicken are my three favorite pizzas here, and I would also recommend the chicken fettucine.

First of all when we came in around 3, it was pretty SLOW, there were not that many customers so we thought we would be done eating within an hour. However when we finished our chips, our server at no point came up to us and updated us on how long the pizza was going to take, we were literally sitting there for about 20 minutes waiting. When she finally brought the pizza out to us, she had forgotten to mention that a gluten free pizza takes a little bit longer than usual. She should have told us that when we first ordered considering that we might have somewhere to go afterwards which we did. She didn't even bring us plates, we had to ask her when she came back with the cheese and pepper shakers.  When we were done with the pizza, our server was no where to be found! We asked another guy to bring us the bill and he said he would go look for her. He obviously didn't find her because we were sitting there for another 10-15 minutes just waiting on our bill. What he could've done was just bring us the bill when we asked for it because that's all we wanted. Then we just decided to just go to the front desk and pay. Another guy was ringing us out and was apologizing for what was going on. It was pretty ridiculous how no one offered to check up on us while we were just sitting waiting patiently for our bill which never came.  This is seriously the SLOWEST customer service we have ever came across. We were there for about 2 hours and we didn't even order that big of a meal.  What was even more rude and disrespectful was when we were walking towards our car in the parking lot, we saw our server and the guy who was looking for her outside in the parking lot having a conversation. The first thing the guy asks us was did we pay? ARE YOU SERIOUS OF COURSE WE PAID, WHAT DO WE LOOK LIKE TO YOU NOT PAYING?! YEAH YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKED, WE SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE PAID TO BE HONEST. That was the first thing he asked us when he saw us, he should have apologized for keeping us waiting when we just simply asked for the bill.

My friends came here for our weekly dinner this week. They ended up getting  the Hawaiian BBQ pizza together, while I got the Caesar salad. I didn't try the pizza, but its pretty good, for a split, considering it takes up a extra large plate. One of my friends was near full, but we all had room for the delicious tiramisu. My salad was over dressed with asiago cheese, but since I love it, it didn't really matter to me. The half size was pretty filling too, so if you're craving salad, I suggest going for the full size. The tiramisu was packed with flavor. None of the rum hand espresso missing. It was in your face, good. Just the right filling and flavor, probably makes it in the top of my tiramisu goodness.

So, plan C, a distant third choice was PF Chang's. It was an hour wait. Then there was CPK.  Out of desperation, we got on the waiting list, a ""mere"" 35 minute wait. That might actually work for us.  To keep warm, we did some more walking and window shopping, stopping at the restaurants to check on our wait progress. By the time we got to CPK, 30 minutes had passed. It was enough walking. We decided just to park our butts there and waited to get seated. The young host screamed, ""Will --- your table is ready!"" Even though we were three booths from the bathroom right near the bar, we were happy to sit. This place is so loud that you could belch and no one would notice!  You could barely hear the muzak system blaring pop classics. The wait persons were a fashion forward bunch with lots of spiked hair, fashionable glasses, tout noir clothes, earrings, etc. And that was just the guys LOL. The place is bright, lively, and fun. Our wait person Jeff was actually quite fast and polite and very good with the refills, stopping to check up on us, etc. He got our drink orders right away, and I was glad they had the Sam Adams Hefeweizen  and Sam Adams Ale, along with a few other beers on tap. My brother had the blue crab cake meal served with a lemony olive oil pasta.  It was actually good not great.  The spices did not overpower the delicately sweet crab meat. My friend had the goat cheese pizza, and I had the Thai Chicken Pizza.  It's sweet and slightly spicy with plenty of cheese and a soft crunchy crust.  The goad cheese with the calamata olives was excellent as well. I've had all their pizzas, and like most of them.  I like how you can add and mix the ingredients in the pizza. Because this is a chain and I've been to about ten of their stores, there was nothing different here in terms of taste and texture, and to me, that's fine.  Another favorite of mine is the Chinese Chicken Salad. They were pushing their Red Velvet cake, but no room in my tummy this time. A few times, some of the men and women drinking too much at the bar walked into the wrong bathroom.  I heard a few, ""Oh Sh!!!!yte"" exclamations before the patron did a 180 turn, and walking into the right one.  My pizza was $14 and the blue crab dinner was $18. Overall, a good time was had. And it was time to spring forward and walk back to the other end of the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine?start=20

The pastas are average at best, and I'm not that crazy about room temperature/cold bread.  Bread should be at least very warm so the butter can melt on it.  If it's not going to be hot, it should taste pretty awesome, which it doesn't.

I've tried this dish at many other places and have not found a better sauce than the one here. It's simply to die for. Who knows what's in it, perhaps it really will kill me, but nevertheless, it's won me over. I like this location because they have a much more architecturally-interesting building and location (notice the bow-trusses and you can see the high-rises around you if you get window seating).

I gotta say, I like the atmosphere of this one a lot. It's nicer than other CPK's (somewhat), but at the same time it's still laid back. The supervisors are really nice and seems to make it one of their priorities to talk to the customers and even help them out a bit in addition to the waiters/waitresses. I remember being waited on quite well, and receiving a lot of attention, and a lot more refills than I actually wanted, but hey more is better =)  Expect the same menu at this location that you see at every other CPK location. You get your salads, your pizzas, your pastas, and your drinks. Straightforward, right? The pizzas here are made well, no complaints yet hah. My personal fave on the menu, however, is the pesto cream penne. Sun dried tomatoes are my secret lovers, and you can always have them add chicken to the dish as well.

Mayumi T.,"Costa Mesa, CA",432,121,95,4.0,4/11/2008,"I used to go here all the time.   Some faves: BBQ Chicken Pizza (classic), Carne Asada Pizza, Two-In-A-Bowl with Adobe Chicken Chowder and Sedona Tortilla Soup, Kung Pao Spaghetti, Singapore Shrimp Rolls, Thai Crunch Salad...and the CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE CAKE!! BBQ Chicken Pizza (on Honey Wheat Pizza Dough, you have to request this) Barbecue sauce, smoked Gouda and Mozzarella cheeses, BBQ Chicken, sliced red onions and cilantro (sometimes they forget the cilantro) Carne Asada Pizza... I am a HUGE fan of mexican food.  I grew up in East L.A. and went to a hispanic day care and Pre-school and had authentic Mexican food.  So, when I'm at CPK and I want a Mexican food fix, I get the carne asada pizza.  Don't let them forget the Tomatillo salsa.  IMO, I don't think the fire-roasted green chiles taste good with it, so I ask them to omit it.  When you eat this pizza, it kinda tastes like you're eating a carne asada burrito. Two-In-A-Bowl with Adobe Chicken Chowder and Sedona Tortilla Soup... both soups are good, why only settle for one?  ^^ Kung Pao Spaghetti really does taste like Kung Pao chicken.  It's slightly sweet, has the roasted peanuts, and green onion.  It can be pretty spicy tho, so if you're sensitive to spice, you can ask them to make it not spicy or mild. Singapore Shrimp Rolls come with tender Shrimp, baby broccoli, soy-sauce marinated Shiitake mushrooms, carrots, noodles, bean sprouts, green onion and cilantro wrapped in rice paper. Served chilled with a sesame ginger dipping sauce and Szechuan slaw.  Delicious!  I like the texture of the noodles.  The sauce goes really well with the rolls.  The marinated Shiitake mushrooms are tender and give the rolls a hearty taste. Thai Crunch Salad... this doesn't taste too much like ""Thai"" food ... more like asian chicken salad.  It has shredded Napa cabbage, chilled-grilled chicken breast, julienne cucumbers, edamame, crispy wontons, peanuts, cilantro, julienne carrots, red cabbage and green onions tossed with a lime-cilantro dressing. Topped with crispy rice sticks and Thai peanut dressing.  Don't let them trick you into adding avocado for $2.50.... maybe that's my cheap inner asian talking.  lol The chocolate souffle cake is wonderful.  It comes with hot fudge, and vanilla bean sauce.  I highly recommend adding the Vanilla Ice Cream.  The vanilla bean sauce is light, creamy and fluffy.  The souffle cake itself is light and chocolatey, but is different from regular chocolate souffle (best chocolate souffle is at Lawrey's/Tam O'Shanters).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine?start=100

Great, only problem all my friends ate the whole dinners before my food even came back and we couldn't find anyone to ask about it. Food finally came and manager came to apologize and offered to comp it, or so I thought but when check came taco's were still on check. I had to ask about removing the charge.

Tara P.,"Irvine, CA",68,47,17,3.0,2/17/2011,"I am always tempted to taste other items besides the pizza, but their pizza is just so yummy :-) I'm sure someday I will steer away from my standard glass of Chateau St. Michelle Riesling, wedge salad and the Roma Tomato/5 cheese pizza.  Although the pizza is really delicious, I'm giving it 3 stars because sometimes their servers aren't so pleasant. I've had quite a few younger servers that seem to be always be rushed and slammed even though there are 10 people in the restaurant.  Another pet peeve I do have about this CPK is the parking! It's nearly impossible to find a space within the allotted restaurant parking since it's set back inside a small shopping center and really only has 10 assigned spaces. Unless you stalk people walking to their car or (like we did on another occasion) or offer a ride to someone walking back to their car in exchange for their space, you can anticipate driving around for at least 10 min looking for a spot to park.  Prices are usually fair- but do tend to be on the pricey side for some of the specialty pizzas. All in all CPK is a good place for GREAT, thin crust pizza...

We have tried all the pizzas on the menu and the  Sicilian is still our favorite one ever. (btw.. don't buy the frozen version.. not the same AT ALL.. chewy meat is not cool).  2) BBQ CHICKEN SALAD WITH AVOCADO: Okay.. we know it's mostly lettuce in any salad, but this salad is so worth the price.. its got a great taste and you must have it with the dressing, we've tried to go healthy and not have the dressing with it, but it is not the same. The half size is almost as big as the full size, so if you are on a budget, just get the half size because it's still enough to share with two people. 3) RED VELVET CAKE: believe it or not, this place serves a mean red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting. This slice of cake is huge, moist, fresh, and equalizes out the saltiness of the pizza you just ate! SERVICE: The service at this location comes and goes with the different servers that work here.

It might have been because I was exhausted and ready to get home, but who knows? First of all, it took forever to find parking, which I was surprised to see on a late Sunday night. This place is a lot smaller than the ones I've been in but the seating and decor were the same as all of the other ones. We sat outside because the restaurant was too cold for us.  We had the baked mac and cheese craving, hummus & pita bread, tequila lime fetuccini, and full carmelized peach salad. Baked mac and cheese was delicious, it should be a full sized appetizer than just a craving! It comes with 4 pieces which I guess is enough for a ""craving"" but you'll wish you had more. I wasn't too pleased with the hummus but I'm not that big of a fan of it in the first place. The tequila lime fetuccini is what has me coming back to CPK over and over and over again. It. Is. To. Die. For. so good. Carmelized peach salad was good, the full size is entirely too big for just one person. Good idea to split that between two people. We added bacon to it thinking it would complement the sweetness but it kind of overpowered everything else. I know you can never have too much bacon, but for a salad...it might have been excessive.

Lennar M.,"Los Angeles, CA",111,113,3,4.0,5/7/2009,"There are hits and misses but your safest bet is to get a pizza. It's like ordering steak at a seafood place, CPK does pizza so you're not going to get the best from them if you order kung pao spaghetti.  As for the service, it's only been bad when it's the busiest and if you come in with a large group. I always seem to get this one guy, Socorro, for my waiter whenever I go and have recognized him and remember his name, so it was a big blaring sign that I've frequented CPK one too many times. If you can, get him as your waiter. I never have had to wait long for my orders, he doesn't check the table so often that it gets annoying, and it doesn't take long for him to take care of our table if something is needed.  My favorite pizza to get is the pear & gorgonzola. The website says it's new but they just stopped serving it for awhile and decided to bring it back again. I stopped going after they told me the last time I went that they no longer serve pear/ gorgonzola pizza. That sweet and savory dish was the only reason I frequented this place. So it was pretty surprising that they're advertising the pizza as new since it's not. Maybe they felt the sting of my tummy's vengeance for not providing one of it's favorite meal's. It feels a little empowering actually.  I should boycott NBC so they can bring back F.R.I.E.N.D.S.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine?start=80

When you get bored with all the rest, try it out. It is on the expensive side, but it is gourmet, kind of like a Wolfgang Putz. Service here was good, and fast. I was on a 90-minute break from a seminar, and the waiter got us served and out with time to spare.

Sarah M.,"Chicago, IL",145,63,3,3.0,3/9/2010,"Aaah, chain restaurants.  Either you like 'em or you don't.  I've been a fan of CPK since I was like 10; I feel like it's a good go to place when you need a quick dinner, you don't want fast food, and you want something relatively healthful.   Anyway so while I can't complain about the quality of the food at this particular CPK, I can complain about their complete inability to manage their take out desk.  (You can take the reservation; you just can't hold the reservation.) Once my husband called in an order and I stood there for 15 minutes while they looked for it because they didn't know Jim was short for James and although I said our last name oh, like 5 times they couldn't find that either. The same thing happened just last week; when I gave our last name, they couldn't find the order although it was clearly on top of the receipt.  I guess my first name Sarah is so long it was just too difficult to read on to the second word following it. They are just dumb, and it's annoying to deal with them.  Summary: food good, service kind of sucky.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine?start=80

Here is a cold, hard fact.  Go to your local grocery store.  Even that scuzzy Ralphs down the block.  Grab one of their CPK FROZEN THIN CRUST PIZZAS.  ""The Sicillian"" is a good choice (Costco has three packs of these on the cheap).  Buy it.  Now, take this large hockey puck home and put it in your oven at 400 degrees.  Wait ten minutes (twelve if you like crispy crust).  Pull it out. Write me a thank you note and even drop me a few bucks for the time, gas, and annoyance I saved you.  I even spared you the horror of dealing with this parking lot...AND you got a better pizza than the one they would be making you inside....probably fresher too.

Christina S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",988,1553,1064,3.0,10/4/2008,"My coworkers and I come here from time to time when we have a gap in our schedule.. Giving us at least an hour to grab some food. So.... In the past (at least three times in the past) the service has sucked! Not sure if our last server was stoned but he was really not present. He roamed around as though he was blind. Oblivious that he had a table that was just seated. We had to remind him about our drinks and our food sat out on the counter for a good ten minutes before the tool brought it out. I can be pretty cool about stuff but it's a tad annoying when you have to ask another server for your bread and your salad.....  Now the other night after work I phoned in a to go order . It was not ready as they said it would have been. So, I decided to order a cocktail and read the paper while I waited. I ordered a Vodka Collins.... I was so bummed when I tried it and it tasted like lemon-aid.

There is usually nothing to complain about except that I need a refill on my strawberry lemonade.  I've been to this CPK a few times with no mishap but this past November I went with a couple friends and received the WORST service ever. We were seated by the host and had to wait 15 minutes before someone took our drink orders. And the MANAGER had to take our orders. The waitress apparently ""didn't realize our table was hers"". Our drinks were brought out and it was another 10 minutes before we received bread. Another 10 minutes before our orders were taken. The food was fine. About 15 minutes into our meal, I wanted some marinara sauce. 5 minutes attempting to flag down our waitress (Stephanie, I think) resulted in another waiter taking pity and getting the sauce. When we were finally ready for the check, we see our waitress, back to the room, flirting with the pizza maker. It took 10 minutes of annoyed waving and gesturing to get the pizza guy to indicate to her that we needed her assistance.  I think she's gone now so don't be afraid to enjoy CPK's dependable menu with good service.

I eat here with my buddies for casual dining. The interior is very inviting and relaxing. I would have to say this CPK franchise is nothing exceptional compared to others. all CPK restaurants provide decent service and quality meals. This place can get pretty packed after 5 on weekends, but the same could be said about other family restaurants in Irvine. Servers are usually friendly most of the time but waiting could be long sometimes. Some of my favorite dishes here are BLT pizza, Sicilian(basil, capicola, etc..) and Fettucine Alfredo.  Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone who's hungry that is looking to have semi-fine casual dining that doesn't hurt your wallet.

One more thing I noticed this past time I went, they have their Nutrition Menu.  I think this is great so you know how many calories your taking-in to make you feel even guiltier for eating this pizza haha.  But in all seriousness, I think that's good that they have a menu with their nutrition facts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine?start=120
