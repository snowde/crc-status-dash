Deyne U.,"Los Angeles, CA",88,9,,1.0,12/31/2015,"In all my years of using Yelp, I've never left a review to dump on a restaurant. This was quite possibly the worst food purchase of my entire life.  For the record, CPK restaurants I've tried elsewhere are much better. This is not a review directed at the entire chain, just this experience in particular. Ordered a margherita pizza for $12.49. I got an awful cheese pizza with hardly any cheese, no flavor, and a few strips of green crap scattered on the cheese like it's supposed to turn feces into food. The only reason that I chose this restaurant is because I had positive experiences in the past and wanted my girlfriend, who never had CPK before, to try a supposedly reputable restaurant chain. This place needs to go for the sake of the customers and the company as well. Our airport needs decent stores and restaurants, not this slop. Awful. Horrible. I'd rather deep fry my hands and bite my fingernails. Sorry CPK but you need to improve the quality of the food at this establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kahului?start=20

Vince N.,"Maui County, HI",420,1467,5808,1.0,5/17/2011,"This is a CPK ASAP. ATMOSPHERE: They're a take out-only counter located inside the Kahului Airport's food court.  Inside-only seating is shared with other restaurants.  It's totally inaccessible unless you're traveling. MENU Salads and frozen limited selection of pizzas. FOOD: The Works Pizza - Horrible.  The whole thing was undercooked and the flavor was bland.  I guess you can't expect much from a frozen disc that goes through a Quizno's-style toaster oven.  Bleh! OVERALL: I am a huge fan of CPK, but this location is a horrible excuse for a CPK.  It's not listed as an ""ASAP"" on the website.  If you're craving pizza, head to Flatbread in Paia, Shakas in Kihei, Lahaina Pizza Company or even a Pizza Hut and get your money's worth!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kahului?start=20
Haven G.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",1,14,1,1.0,10/12/2014,"This was the worst dining experience during my trip to Maui. I thought I was safe ordering from a familiar restaurant. I ordered a Thai pizza with no bean sprouts. When they called my number the woman behind the counter kept repeating, ""of, no bean sprouts"" a few times over. That's when she threw it in the box and put uncooked vegetables on it. When I questioned her about it she said that's how they made it here. When I went to ask for my money back she turned around and walked away from me. I have now watched several customers walk away with fully cooked pizzas including the vegetables.  Worse, my pizza is burnt. Don't eat here.

There are a lot of seats to sit down which is wonderful -- if the only thing to compare it  to was Terminal 6 or 7 at LAX this place would get 9 stars.

Go through this security line where we'll take you of everything you own, then rebuy it on the inside.  Whatever, they made my girlfriends pizza without sausage, but handed it out to another customers, we didn't feel like waiting ten more minutes, so she said she would take it, they didn't thank her for that or offer her anything in exchange, just called her number like they didn't just have a conversation and we were on our way.

California Pizza Kitchen is generally reliable. However, if trapped at the Maui Airport, do not grace this place with you presence. My wife tried to order a salad and the cashier told her to just grab one from the cooler and proceeded to be rude to every customer in line. I did enjoy watching 15 customers walk away including me.

Fran C.,"Honolulu, HI",460,954,11214,3.0,10/4/2017,"Are you sure this is a CPK? Okay, okay...........I get it.  All of these restaurants in the Kahului Airport is run by HMS Host, so even though you see the eateries in the airport like - California Pizza Kitchen or Burger King, you may not be actually eating the food with the same standard as you would get, if you had gone to their regular restaurant in a mall.  Does that make sense? I was flying home from Maui when I realized I needed to stop & get something to eat for lunch. A 5:00 pm lunch is pretty late, but better late, then never? No? While hangin' at the airport, I noticed a CPK, so I decided to check out the newly revamped food court in the Kahului airport.  Upon walking into the little food court, it was totally empty..........but that's okay with me, because that means no waiting for me! Upon walking up to the ordering counter, I was greeted right away, and upon looking over the menu I decided to get a Magherita Pizza which consisted of Italian tomatoes with fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, & parmesan. And to wash all of this down, I got an ice tea ($2.99). What can I say about the grub? Basically when you've been up since 5 am, and are eating lunch at 5 pm, anything you eat at this time probably taste pretty good by now! Lol! But in all honesty............I really thought I was eating some kinda Tombstone frozen cheese pizza! Buwahahahahaha! Take a look at the pic I took of my Magherita pizza! Where was the tomatoes, & basil??? Small kine M.I. A. if you can see the pic I took of my pizza!!!  Well, maybe my expectations were kinda high, but this pizza definitely wasn't worth the $13.69 I shelled out for a small personal sized pizza, nor was the $2.99 I paid for the ice tea, but I guess I was paying for the ""convenience"" factor at the airport. There are not too many food options at the Kahului Airport, so if you're hungry...........may I suggest you buy & eat something before you head to the airport, otherwise you maybe stuck with bad, & expensive food!

The lines were extremely long, there were only three people staying the whole place: one at the register, one adding toppings too pizzas, and another loading them into the oven and boxing them once done. The staff were taking their time walking from one station to another, a little more leisurely than a frazzled traveler would like anyway. We were told that there was a twenty minute wait for pizzas. When our number was called, we had to inhale our meal before dashing to our gate, which at this point had already started boarding our number.

Unfortunately, I was wrong. My first clue should have been that this was a CPK counter and not a sit-down restaurant. The food was poorly made and only vaguely resembled the food I have had at other California Pizza Kitchen locations. We ordered the Hawaiian Pizza, Tortilla Soup, and the Chinese Chicken Salad. The soup was the only item that tasted good. The pizza was under-cooked and the salad was premade. I wish I told the cashier to cancel the salad from our order when she told me to grab a salad from the refrigerated shelf, but she had already rang up my husband's credit card so I selected my salad and hoped for the best.

Raptor C.,"Glendora, CA",0,17,,1.0,11/25/2016,"This is my first completely negative review of any kind.  The service was horrible and the food was horrible too.  Very surprising, considering that CPK is normally a very positive dinning experience. I recently visited Maui and my wife and I went to CPK based on positive previous expriences and I wanted to enjoy a quick decent meal before my flight back to the states.  It was a big, big mistake. I waited in line and I went to place my order as I contacted a young woman behind the counter.  She seemed annoyed and did not even make eye contact with me, let alone say ""hi.""  I ordered two pizzas and two beers.  One beer for me and one for my wife, who was sitting down and looking after our luggage.  The cashier looked at me and said in a robotic/perturbed way, ""You can only order one beer at a time.""  I tried to explain to her that I was ordering food for my wife and I and one of the beers was for her.  I tried to explain to her that my wife was watching our bags, when she interrupted me in mid-sentence.  ""You can only order one beer at a time"", as she explained it to me again like I was a child asking for an extra treat.  I noticed that there were about 8 people behind me and I did not want my wife to wait in line for only one beer, so I offer what I thought was a reasonable solution.  I pointed to my wife, who was sitting down about 10 feet away and I asked if it was ok for her to come up to the counter, show her ID, so she could buy a beer and avoid waiting in line. This simple request was met with a reaction as if I asked her to explain Einstein's Theory of Relativity.  She rolled her eyes and said she would need to ask her ""manager"" for permission.  She yelled over to the area of the adjacent Burger King and asked some man if I could buy two beers. Needless to say, he said no.  This scene was similar to the Meet the Parents movie scene with the female flight attendant at the end of the movie.  ""Step aside sir"", when there was no one there, was replaced with, ""You can only buy one beer at a time.""     My wife and I sipped on the one beer we were given permission to buy and when my food came up, I walked to the counter.  The worker placed the food on the counter and quickly walked away.  No, ""thank you"" or, maybe asking if I wanted a napkin.     The pizzas were bad.  Too much sauce and not enough cheese.  The crust tasted like it had been frozen and it was not fresh.  If someone would have served this to me and told me it was from CPK, I would not have believed them.  It really was that bad. This place is giving CPK a bad name and someone from corporate needs to pay a little unannounced visit as a customer.  At this location, CPK appeared to be merged with a Burger King here and I hope that this not a continuing trend.  CPK needs to do a little research and look up the Green Burrito/Carl's Jr. merger that happened years back.   A really bad experience on all levels.  Wake up CPK!!!  You are better than this worthless abomination.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kahului

It's located in a little food court within the airport. Also located here was Burger King, Pinkberry and a bar (name escapes my mind). Initially, I was drawn to Burger King but after seeing the price of a Whopper meal was comparable to a pizza, I decided to go with a semi-healthier option of CPK. Overall, the service was okay and so was my pizza. Nothing to really write about. It's not as good as the restaurant but it is from a fast food setting. The size of the pizza was decent and since we ordered 2 pizzas (one per person) it was more than enough for me. My only gripe was how does a margherita pizza cost more than their other pizzas? I found that strange considering it's the simplest pizza to make. Eh moving on. :)  They also sell pre-made salads and sandwiches but I can't speak for those.  Would I eat here again?

Mel B.,"San Diego, CA",372,414,773,3.0,10/11/2014,"Came by to pick up a pizza before heading back to Cali.  It was either Burger King or CPK and I picked CPK because I thought it'd be a little more healthier.   I also order the chicken Thai pizza when I'm at CPK so that's what I got.  But when I finally got my order and opened the box, it just wasn't what I was expecting or what I was used as opposed to eating the pizza at the restaurant.   The carrots, for one, where so much bigger, and so much more.  It kind of took away the flavor of the pizza.  Also, there was a lack of chicken and sauce.   Maybe it's different ordering pizza from the counter than ordering at the sit down.  I don't know but I think I'll save my $11.99 and go to the restaurant.  Note: cash register was nice.  I have no problem w/customer service but the pizza just wasn't as good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kahului
