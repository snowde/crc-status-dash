Siera S.,"Honolulu, HI",115,43,65,5.0,9/16/2017,"This location was quite cramped & a bit warm. It was a hot day so we elected to eat inside to enjoy the AC, which unfortunately wasn't working very well. The staff was very nice and our waiter Zack made our visit a 5 star experience. He was attentive, cordial & friendly. He made sure to refill our drinks when we were running low & offered great menu advice when my husband was unsure about what to order. My son and I shared the garlic alfredo pasta with mushrooms, we loved it! It was cheesy and had the perfect amount of mushrooms. My husband had the tortilla soup and avocado spring rolls, which he thoroughly enjoyed & of course we loved the bread!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=20
Mikey H.,"San Diego, CA",352,821,2768,4.0,9/24/2016,"So what do people from California do when they come to Hawaii?  They go to California Pizza Kitchen...LOL!  I picked up Tracy and since she was staying out in Kailua, I figured we'd eat somewhere out there.  The wait wasn't bad since it was late afternoon.  We ordered a couple of mules and the Thai Chicken Pizza, which is one of my favorites.  It is the right blend of flavors and it's just tasty.  Our server, ""Josh"" (not his real name...can't remember) was attentive without being intrusive. The second time we came here, our friend Deb had just flown in from San Jose.  Again, we laughed and decided to come here.  The wait was only about 10 minutes and we sat inside this time.  We ordered the same pizza, the spinach dip, and some dumplings.  Everything came out in a timely manner.  Our server, ""Jessica"" (not her real name...can't remember), was friendly and took great care of us!  I believe the manager, ""Sharon"" (not her real name...can't remember), even stopped by to see how everything was.   Maybe it was the fact that I kept taking pictures of our food that we had great service.  Maybe they thought we were from corporate checking up on them...after all, we are from California...LOL!  I think most of the impatient reviewers on here have a high expectation for a chain restaurant that's in Hawaii...one of the chillest places to visit.  Or if they came in ""Hangry""...20 minutes will seem like forever.   My two visits were great!  Good food and service...and plenty aloha!  I would definitely come back, and hopefully none of those ""hangry"" Yelpers are around!  LOL!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=20
Foe T.,"Kaneohe, HI",91,2,1,2.0,7/3/2017,"First time to CPK in Kailua, and maybe the last! Ordered artichoke dip and the chips were stale. My 1yr old son was served a bowl of fruits that looked like they were initially cut up for a cocktail drink probably had been sitting out for awhile because they were starting to turn brown. Also waited 30mins to order, and no they were not busy. Only had 4 other tables occupied, 2 of which had already been served.  As for our waiter Tina she was very pleasant and I didnt mind leaving her a tip because our drinks were never empty and our food came out in a timely manner. Heard so many good things about this place and wanted to experience what all the hype was about,  left feeling let down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=20
Michelle L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,38,3,1.0,12/29/2017,"I didn't feel like driving to Ala Moana to eat at CPK so we settled for the Kailua CPK.  Bad idea.  The food stilllll sucks at the Kailua CPK.  The avocado rolls were not filled and seemed extra oily.   The servings of pasta were way less than the CPK at Ala Moana and did not taste as good too.  The servings were so small, we were able to finish our meals.  At the Ala Moana CPK, we always have leftovers to bring home and leave happy.  So diappointed for a pricey dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=20
Charnell L.,"Honolulu, HI",43,5,4,1.0,8/17/2017,"Let Me start off by saying, that up until today, I VOUCHED for CPK in Kailua. My other half and I would eat here every friday(literally) and they never disappointed. We got there a little before 7am, and asked for a booth. We always expect a 45-1 hour wait because like I said we go there a lot. After not going to this location due to us moving farther away, we were in the area and decided to eat dinner there!(yay)..not. the hostess, who was a young girl let us know that there is a booth who have their food boxed up and that it would be about 15-20 minutes. So we said GREAT!(We thought, wow, perfect timing) My other half and I get talking and notice that HOLY CRAP, it's 8 o'clock!  I send my other half to ask the hostess what's going on, and if they're not going to leave, if she can seat us else where already. He came back, and said ""we got interrupted by the general manager(peter), but she basically said they have they're check but are taking longer to leave. I wait another 5 minutes(pissed at this point, which is the only reason I sent my other half to talk to her). At this point, we are investigating the 3 booths they have and notice that the table she pointed out that was supposed to be for us, has a different family seated!!!! So not only did we wait for nothing, she lied about when I asked her. Then I told her to seat us elsewhere, and she said, it's still going go be a wait for another table. (W.T.F) her attitude sucked. So, after a terrible experience trying to get seated, we sit at the table that these 2 girls had come in after, and had already finished eating at. We decide the food is always great here and we would give them benefit of the doubt. We get greeted by a waitress and she comes out with the most stale pieces of bread, that it was crumbling at the touch. We order the avocado egg rolls and they were LITERALLY half filled, and soggy on the bottom. We then ordered a chicken picatta(noodles were overdone) and I got a thin crust roasted garlic and chicken pizza(just letting you know they charge an extra 1.50 for thin crust and DON'T tell you). So when getting my pizza, I pick up a piece and the bottom of the pizza is not crispy AT ALL, and just falls.  I decide that's it. I dealt with the bad customer service, I dealt with the bad bread and appetizer, I am NOT eating this pizza that already overpriced and it sucks. Especially when I'm paying more for thing crispy pizza and it's soggy. I ask for the manager and it ends up being a man named peter whom I watched as he approached two ladies sitting next to us, asking them their name and from my perspective, he was a little more interested in their attention, instead of anything else. So upon getting him as the manager, I was disappointed. He gave us the normal ""manager"" things to say, and took care of our bill. He was ""nice"", but I'm a manager, and I know what the bullshit things to say are, and he definitely milked it on that. I miss the old crew who were always nice. Especially Hannah. Long story short. Never Coming to This Location Ever Again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=20
Kim B.,"Kaneohe, HI",0,12,10,1.0,9/16/2017,"We go to Kailua a lot to visit a bubble tea joint  but every time we pass by CPK, my mind brings me back to our terrible experience here. We literally left the place with two hungry grouchy kids at 9:pm and a hangry husband who pledges to never come back. The waiter brought out bread, took our order. We ate the bread, drank some water and waited...30 minutes later... waited... 45 minutes later... the waiter comes out and tells us that it's the pasta guy, he's behind on his pasta! No apologies, just that it was the pasta guys fault. For all we know, he could've forgotten to put in our order, but then there was hardly any communication so we'll never really know what actually happened. Finally an hour went by and we got up and left unnoticed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=20
Hawaii M.,"Honolulu, HI",0,32,4,1.0,11/12/2017,"How many chances should you give a restaurant? This was our fourth awful visit in a row at the Kailua CPK location. It used to be really great here and always worth the wait to be seated. Now, once you get seated, the wait to get service and then food takes FOREVER. And never an apology.  When we got our water, one of the straws was dirty and the server commented about how some kind of syrup must have gotten on it. And then left it.  The manager came to tell us that there was a problem with the pizza we ordered and it would take a while longer than the other dishes. So we ordered soup and salad instead. That still took 10 minutes longer than the rest.  We asked to taste a couple wines and the samples arrived a minute before the dinners. Our bread arrived maybe 10 minutes before that. The smell of poop ... we're guessing that was the smell since there were a couple chickens hanging around - did not help the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=20
Krystal K.,"Honolulu, HI",1,10,2,1.0,10/7/2017,"I'm not the kind of person to write a bad review. I have worked in the food industry before so I know how hard servers and kitchens are working to deliver good food each night. I also know bad service and a bad restaurant when I see it. I want to share my experience with customers so they can have a full view of this restaurant before they decide to dine there.   - My party and I got there around 4:30 pm on a Saturday. Although the restaurant was not full with customers it took a while for our server to even greet us and even longer to get water after we were seated. - When taking our order our server abruptly joked about ordering shots (I'm fine with shots and drinking he was just a little too enthusiastic about us ordering some - shots are mentioned later which made this comment seem strange in retrospect). - We waited for a while for our food to arrive (spinach & artichoke dip + BBQ chicken salad) and a party was seated next to us. Their server joked about ordering a round of shots. It was a family with grandparents, parents, and 2 children. The grandmother said she was allergic to alcohol and she wanted a mango lemonade. The server said she was allergic too and breaks out in hives but she still chooses to drink alcohol. - Our food arrived and the chips were stale and the chicken in the salad had a strange consistency like it was under cooked.  We didn't take home any leftovers. The food was gross.  - During our meal I saw a server walk to the drink station to get a drink which the other servers were doing (the others were totally normal - getting a glass, filling the glass with ice using a scoop, and pouring water for themselves) but this server took a glass and scooped ice into the cup from the ice station directly with the glass! This is a huge no-no - you're supposed to use a scooper to avoid your hands getting all in the ice and for safety reasons (if that glass chips, the entire ice load is ruined and people could drink ice).   I was so glad when the meal was done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=20

Every time I go in there's old food on my plate or something floating in my tea/water cup. Last time we got an appetizer, salad, and an entree and each plate/ bowl had crusty leftovers on it.

Cindy P.,"Las Vegas, NV",94,142,582,5.0,6/21/2017,"I have walked and drove by this restaurant too many times to count, after all I've been to a CPK and what else is there to know. This location is in my own city and happens to have a lot of tourists. I try to avoid the tourist locations, but something about the design of the restaurant drew me in. They seated me on the lanai or patio as non - locals would call it. It had a beautiful view of a fountain.  Of course, it wouldn't be Hawaii without a chicken wandering around looking for scraps. The service was very prompt and polite. The food was exactly how CPK should serve their food... hot and tasty.  I think what impressed me most about this CPK was the lanai and it's view.  I think today was just a day to remember.  Remember, it isn't always just the food, it's the views and even the chickens.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=20
Darin O.,"Honolulu, HI",4723,814,661,3.0,3/12/2017,I truly enjoyed the covered outdoor area for eating this past time I visited CPK Kailua.  that made it wonderful for the fact that the weather was beautiful and the whole evening could not have been more enjoyable with friends with the gentle winds blowing.  The weather was perfect!  The seats were just in that perfect spot too.  It just made the whole evening perfect. Food wise- yes CPK when it first came to the islands was a wonderful treat of Asian/ Italian Fusion dishes that melted in the taste buds. Now I have a go to meal in mind for good old comfort food.  So it is more staple and less Romantic treat as it used to be. Service was wonderful the past night we went- I think the servers too felt the beautiful weather and even though they were at work fully enjoyed the life living in Hawaii Nei! I guess being not as busy as the Kahala location helps make the food come out quicker and the service to be just a tab better but still a wonderful experience for dining out in beautiful HI.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=20
April Y.,"Kailua, HI",39,167,183,4.0,5/18/2016,"Got to participate on a field trip excursion with some friends over here today. Kids were given a tour of the inside of CPK's kitchen led by their very own Mr. Magic. Each kid also got to make their very own personal pizza - decorate it with the sauce, cheese and topping choices of olives, pepperoni, and pineapples. As kids were guided to the back kitchen, they were amazed and wowed by watching their lil pizzas get to go in the oven!  Staff were extremely pleasant, and courteous! Nothing but smiles on their faces as they watched my kids go bonkers. Mr. Magic was wowing kids with some magic tricks up his sleeves! My one Keiki ended up melting down as she did not get the opportunity to do one particular trick the other kids did. We were able to get a one on one demo of his trick once he saw the tears. And to make her smile and giggles come back he gave her a special biting a coin in half trick! Not gonna lie even I was impressed watching him go at it! All tears quickly vaporized and my little ones eyes became very big as she was amazed at watching him eat a coin, then witness it being put back together! My girls LOVED their pizzas, and I have to admit - they looked extremely tasty! I was allowed a sample bite of their crust in exchange for a taste of my lettuce! (I ordered the shrimp and chicken lettuce wrap.) The gal who put my order ready out some extra lettuce pieces in for me, and I am extremely grateful. If you order the lettuce wraps - you can not go wrong! Quite filling and even though it's listed as an appetizer, boy does the portion end up being an entree! Thank you so very much CPK for this wonderful treat to my kids today! Loved it! I'll be here to eat for sure another time! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=20
Kimmy A.,"Aiea, HI",0,14,2,3.0,7/16/2017,"Giving 3 stars because some days are good and other days I dead that I chose this place to eat. Some servers are excellent and always check on my party and fills up our drinks. Others times when it's a party of 2, some waiters don't care as much because our bill won't be as high as other party with 5 people. Another this is that sometimes the food wasn't worth the wait.

She brought share plates to her other tables .She refilled drinks to her other tables .We had to flag her down to refill our drinks.She cleared dishes from her other tables .We had to pile ours in the middle of our table to make room for our desserts.

Neill T.,"Las Vegas, NV",22,10,,5.0,7/18/2017,"Great Service.  Had the waitress pair a wine of my choice first, then any food.  She chose a pizza, cheese.  There was other stuff but any wine connoisseur would know, cheese and wine go great together.  Free bread, with oil of course.  Balsamic vinegar, of the same blend, and yes, it would have been a Michelin star.  That's all. Tip for the winemaker of the blend, I forgot which one I ordered(that's how good the meal was), dry as f. Every girl knows, I'm a guy weird but I know this stuff, blends should always be sweet.  Tip from maragaritaville.   Flour recipe must be a California recipe, the wheat has too much of the wrong stuff.  Better to use just phosphorus and potassium in equal amounts, nitrogen can be synthesized easily, plant lead structure is everything you need to know about what a plant's job is. Make food. Even poison is a flavor, everyone knows that. That's why we bred Nightshades, better known as tomatoes and eggplants as well as chili peppers to all be used for food. I'm assuming this is a worldwide thing that happened just before the Middle Ages, when people will still smart enough to build aqueducts above the ground and it underneath.  Anyway, great food, pairing was perfect, I forgot the name of the waitress, but I was the guy that sat alone, and outside.  Great pairing. Malbec or a red blend(made by the bartender, its just house wine after all that is supposed to be mixed to taste, or perfect)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=20

Heidi H.,"Honolulu, HI",48,108,1433,1.0,5/26/2014,"It's my first time at the Kailua location. I burned my throat eating the bread with olive oil, I found out the hard way that  it has chili pepper seeds hidden in the herbs and pepper flakes. A seed went slowly down my throat and burned my throat.  Who knew it had chili pepper seeds? When I mentioned it to one of the staff she said the oil has pepper flakes.  I replied that no one told me about the small chili pepper seeds hidden in the herbs and olive oil.  I pointed out the seeds in the little white dish.  I had to request butter to put on another small piece of bread to coat my throat since the water I drank just made the burning down my throat worse.  I ordered the watermelon strawberry salad with chicken. Don't order the chicken.  It was so salty that I couldn't swallow the chicken.   I had them remove the chicken and just ate the salad. They left the piece of chewed chicken on the plate when it was brought back to the table. They didn't even offer to put another piece of chicken so I guess their chicken is always made too salty. I had to ask that the extra price of the chicken be removed from my bill since I had it removed and the waitress didn't indicate the additional cost would be taken off.  I was very disappointed in the quality of the food and the response received.  Could the bad chicken be in response to me originally returning the salad because I ordered the salad with dressing on the side and it came out with the dressing already mixed in?

The only reason I gave it three stars was because the food was good! The service I experienced today was absolutely horrible. I was going to give my server Jared the benefit of the doubt since it was slightly busy when we first came in but even after it started to slow down the service didn't improve. No plates were given when at the beginning of the order I mentioned we'd be sharing an app, pizza, and salad. We weren't checked on until the end of the meal. The salad was brought to us incorrectly and I had to mention that the avo was missing. Drinks weren't refilled when both of them were empty. And when we asked for our tab it took him ten minutes to hand us our bill. I work in the service industry myself so for me to even write a yelp review (which all industry ppl hate) it definitely means that this was a bad experience!

Heidi K.,"Kailua, HI",0,24,11,2.0,9/7/2016,"If you knew me, my friends and family you would know we love CPK. This evening I ordered curbside service given a pick up time of 7:00. I arrived promptly at 7:00 called CPK and was transferred to the correct desk. I waited on hold for 14 minutes before I packed up my child with his wheelchair and headed into CPK. There I waited another 4 minutes before I stopped a waitress to ask if I could get my order. Only knew how long because I was still on hold waiting for them to answer. My next encounter was with the manager. I expressed my concern about how long I was on hold and waiting. She said that was not possible and quizzed me about how I contacted the location. Still on hold and the light flashing on her phone. Then as she noticed I was displeased with her attitude she offered to deliver it to my car, I was already there so said I'd wait.  They gathered my food and I laid the money on the counter. At this point she comped my food. Kind of apologized. By no means did I want my food for free. The apology was weak but appreciated. If they are unable to handle the curbside service they should just offer to go inside.  This is the third time I have spent between 30 and 40 minutes trying to get my curbside order.

Krysten I.,"Honolulu, HI",624,1458,1938,4.0,12/30/2014,"I ate at this CPK located in Kailua town shortly after dining at a restaurant that was sorely lacking organization. I sat facing the kitchen and marveled at the efficiency CPK must pride itself in. Seriously, I've never gotten an order wrong and my food is always delivered in such a timely manner.  This particular Kailua location shares a parking lot with Longs and Macy's. There is ample parking in the brightly lit parking structure and there are some neat shops on the walk to the restaurant. This location is tiny compared to the Ala Moana and Kahala locations; in addition, it is super popular among the residents of Kailua, so be prepared to wait. They do have bar seating that is usually available, in addition to the normal table seating (both indoor and outdoor). The also have a take out side (and little waiting area) on the street side of the restaurant. Because it is so tiny and popular though, it tends to get loud.  You can always count on CPK for consistent food options. My favorites include the BBQ chicken salad, the waldorf chicken salad, the grilled vegetable sandwich with caesar salad  and the kung pao spaghetti. Drink wise, I like their flavored teas and lemonades (with free refills!!) and their white sangria and mojitos.  The service here is typical of other CPKs I have been to, which is a good thing--the waiters are experienced and friendly and really create an experience that you want to return to. CPK also has a little rewards program that conveniently sums up your points on their mobile app. It's not very rewarding, but it's kinda fun to receive $5 off or a free dessert every other time I go.  The only downside to this restaurant is the size. I really wish they would expand!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=80

Chris C.,"Kailua, HI",0,6,5,2.0,6/5/2017,"I have been going here for years and now I can say that I'm pretty much done. I love the quinoa arugula salad and always ask for it without the feta cheese and again it showed up with feta in it. I didn't send it back since that would take forever (I did it before when they didn't put the dressing on the side and they put so much that it makes it soggy). I picked out what I could and told both managers that came over spontaneously just to see how things were going. We were more upset that the pear Gorgonzola pizza was not on the menu, which is the only thing that my boyfriend goes there for and it's been there for years. There is a new make your own pizza and salad place (Pieology) opening in Kailua that will have more vegan options, so we'll be going there instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=80

Unfortunately we waited for over 10 minutes and after endless ringing and multiple unanswered calls we were forced to go inside. What's the point of curbside service if you're not going to answer the phone and force customers to go inside to pickup their food? This completely defeats the purpose of CURBSIDE pickup.  The staff inside were completely useless and when we tried to explain the situation and ask why they weren't picking up the phones we were told that the phones were working fine for everyone else and that they would speak to a manager, which did nothing to help our situation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=80
Kaitlin L.,"Aiea, HI",0,1,,1.0,6/19/2016,"CPK Kailua was terrible. We had the worst waiter that had such a bad attitude and such bad food. He even had someone else clean our table and bring us our checks because he did not want to come back and talk to us while he was behind the bar talking to his coworkers. On top of that, our food took almost 30 minutes, all the while our waiter never put in our appetizer order and we never got it. We couldn't even ask him if it was coming because he would not make eye contact and would not ask us if we needed something else. We then saw our food sit under the heat lamps and on the counter to be served for a long period of time before they actually were brought to our table. When our food finally arrived, none of the dressing came with the salad, I had to ask for it, and the food that was supposed to be hot was cold. My boyfriends sandwich was hard and he didn't finish it, which is a first. I would understand if it was busy, but it was midday, only a few tables, and lots of staff just talking.

They took orders for drinks and brought one and then disappeared for ages and would come back and bring out another one (one at a time). We had appetizers and bread and they brought no plates. We had to ask for plates. They brought 4 plates, though there were 6 of us. We had to ask them to bring 2 more plates. We asked for balsamic vinegar... that didn't come till the bread was almost gone. Food was great, but I don't know what the deal with the servers were.

The bbq chicken salad is really good as well as appetizers, you can't go wrong with avocado club rolls or spinach artichoke dip. Today I ordered the chicken piccata and my noodles were super mushy which was unusual since they're usually consistent...but it took them three tries to get the noodles to the right texture.

He was simply a joy to have as a server, always checking on us, gave us to go cups for the DELICIOUS lemonade, would joke around with us and he made suggestions that we then chose! Started with some fresh from the oven bread with olive oil and herbs, which I would say the only downfall was we each got one 1"" slice of their bread. We wanted more, but my scale thanks you. My friend ordered the Hawaiian Pizza (this girls diet consists of pizza, wings, and bacon) and she loved it and didn't realize how hungry she was until she finished all but one slice. My sister had a bbq sandwich and a ceaser side and I had the California club with caeser salad on the side. Both were yummy these sandwiches were bigger than we thought and both ended up taking home the other half. But in all honesty, I saved my other half for lunch tomorrow so I could get dessert.  Mike suggested the Belgian Chocolate Souffle with ice cream, I ordered and we all ate it!

When we walked up to the hostess bar, the manager said that if we wanted to be seated right away, we were more than welcome to sit at the bar. Of course we jumped at the chance since we were famished! The bartender was very attentive, kept our drinks filled and always checked up on us. Even though the restaurant was quite busy, we didn't really feel the hustle and chaos since we were out of the main dining area.

Corey A.,"Kailua, HI",191,38,95,1.0,7/18/2016,"My family regularly dines at our neighborhood CPK Kailua Hawaii and we return because we are almost always satisfied with the food and the service. However, today we picked up our takeout order and we were COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED. We travel a lot and something that gives us comfort is knowing that the CPK on the mainland will be consistent with the taste and service of our hometown and go-to restaurant here in Kailua. Sometimes with orders there are slight mistakes but today almost everything in our order DID NOT MEET OUR EXPECTATIONS. First of all, it took over an hour for the order to be completed, which is unacceptable.  Secondly, when my husband Corey picked up our order, the person handed him our drinks in a huge bag without a drink carrier. The lemonade and apple juice fell over, spilled and the bottom of the paper bag got wet and he had to take it upon himself to ask for a drink carrier. Unfortunately 1/3 of our kid's lemonade was already gone and there was no offer to fill it up. The bag was wet, falling apart, and the items almost fell out of the bag by the time he got home.  When we opened up the FUSILLI ALFREDO, it looked different from what my daughter was used to. This is basically all she eats from CPK so she definitely knows what its supposed to look and taste like. Sure enough, it was WATERY AND WITHOUT TASTE. We tried adding some salt to it, but nonetheless, after one bite, we couldn't stomach any more. It was a waste. Both the BBQ CHICKEN PIZZA AND THE WORKS PIZZA was disappointing as well. The crust on both were SOGGY and the ingredients were not at the high standard we are used to from CPK Kailua. It almost tasted OLD, like eating re-heated leftovers. Lastly, the 4 ice cream sundaes barely had any ice cream in the cups. Most of the cup was filled with whipped cream and we were surprised and disappointed yet again.   We tossed everything but the spaghetti with meat sauce and wedge salad.  We have never had an order like this so we decided as a family to let you know as a courtesy in order to help your future guests. Because of this experience, we are considering opting for other restaurants in the area instead of our go-to CPK.

Matt M.,"Honolulu, HI",2,10,,3.0,4/13/2017,"Forewarned is Forearmed We've been visiting this Kailua CPK since it first opened and this is my first review of this store.  First the positives- deliciously consistent and tasty food; attentive and friendly bar, counter and waiters and waitresses. Because we really enjoy their food, and I like cold Newcastle beer in a frosted glass, we've designed a few strategies for eating at this CPK: 1) If ordering for pickup, plan to arrive later than you've been told to arrive. You should also ask if they are running a school special that evening.  Or, just arrive when they say to arrive, but plan to have a cold beer at the bar while watching some sports.  The bartenders (JJ in particular) are excellent and the beers are always served in a frozen glass.  2) Be sure to go through your entire order piece by piece to make sure you are getting what you ordered. (We actually write it down before calling it in and use that as a checklist) Sometimes they are a little skimpy on the salads and pastas when you order to go...but when it is pointed out they will make it right. Don't forget to ask for bread and their tasty, herbed olive oil. 3) When you are dining in, be prepared to take an active role in getting your food on time. If you are pressed for time, order everything quickly and ask for updates. Often they are working too many tables and they are not pros, so checking in seems to help. Or, just be prepared to take your time and enjoy yourself. Forewarned. Once we implemented these strategies, we really began to enjoy our Kailua CPK experiences. Everyone seems to be trying their best and the food is delicious. It's just a busy store and it helps to plan ahead and to set your expectations properly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=60
Karis W.,"Renton, WA",1,42,4,1.0,1/26/2017,"This was the worst CPK experience I've had at any mainland CPK and even Seoul CPK.  The hostess, Sunshine, was super rude when we checked in. She told us it'd be 20 minutes for us to sit but the restaurant had many many open tables. After waiting for 10 minutes, we asked her for an update and also inquired as to why we were waiting when so many tables were open (was it because there were tons of reservations?), she didn't give us an explanation but snapped at us, saying ""I said it'd be 20 minutes. It's 20 minutes."" We were super taken aback by this kind of behavior. She was cold and unconcerned. When prompted again and when we asked to speak to her manager, she said that the manager was holding on seating because the kitchen was overwhelmed. She could have kindly and gently explained the situation to us but her rude and uncaring demeanor is inexcusable.  After being seated, we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, a glass of Pinot Noir, roasted veggie salad with salmon and a chicken BBQ pizza. The chips that came with the dip were SO stale, the wine was corked (we had to ask for a different glass), and the salmon was insanely overlooked and hard (after specific prior request to ensure salmon wasn't overdone).  Worst. CPK. Ever. Idk who is in charge of this place , but their operations are horrible. The manager was also barely concerned at the lack of service and awful food.

Tim E.,"Kailua, HI",1,1,,1.0,10/31/2016,"CPK Kailua...What is up with the poor service here? Unacceptable. Created an account just so I could review this place. Had I known there were so many bad reviews of this branch I would have never came here. Pay close attention to the 1 and 2 star reviews before you come here.  Ordered food at 8:00 with a requested pickup time at 9:00. I arrived at 9:05 and was told by the hostess that my order was not ready yet. I looked around and there were only 3 tables being waited on so I said whatever and just took a seat. 15 minutes later and the hostess is stuffing my order in big brown bag and practically shoving it in my face without saying a word to me. I thought, gee thanks! No sorry or anything for making me wait. Took food and left. My friend ordered the Roasted Veggie salad and when we got home we discovered that her salad consisted only of lettuce, cheese and avocado. Unacceptable. She called CPK Kailua and they confirmed they had given her the wrong salad and to come back. When I got back to CPK I saw the same hostess (tall African American woman behind the cash register) and I simply said that she gave me the wrong salad. She became extremely defensive with me saying ""No I didn't, No I didn't. You're just missing the toppings."" She preceded to the back and retrieved a tiny container with the missing veggies and practically flung it at me. Again, no apologies or compensation of any kind for making me drive all the way back to CPK to receive the rest of my order. I'll admit that at this point I was a little upset, but instead of making a scene I simply took my food and left. As I was walking to my car, a hostess followed me out of the restaurant and in a real condescending tone she said ""Byeeeeee Tim Evans!"" I was absolutely shocked. Real professional CPK, real professional. I have never experienced such poor service in my whole life. California Pizza Kitchen I hope you are reading this because you just lost 2 customers for life.

This is my first time at this location and my wife warned me ahead of time that it does get pretty loud but the sound of the lime agave margarita made me not give a rip.  The mojito and lime agave margarita was a perfect starter before we ordered some appetizers. Lettuce ( I prefere the romain lettuce instead if the iceberg stuff) wrapps with chicken filling and the nachos with artichoke and avocado dip were really good but the sesame ginger chicken dumplings were cold like it was premade and waiting for someone to order it but it was good. I prefer it hot though.  The soy ginger chili sauce saved this dish. Our meals followed with the California club sandwich, bbq chicken salad, shrimp fettuccine, chinese chicken salad and I had the habanero carnitas pizza. Koa our waiter reminded me to order the thin crust pizza next time if I don't like the crust because theres more pizza. I kept tearing off the crust from the hand tossed. While eating the pizza, I was thinking, this pizza is not as hot as I thought it would be. Only when we were done our friend tasted what was in a small dish at the far end of the table and started gagging and reached for the water and started guzzling it. Well whatayaknow! I guess we found the salsa for my pizza hahaha! We took home the club sandwich and it is delicious at midnight while writing this review.  We had another round of mojitos and margaritas for desert. Perfect way to end a great lunch with some good friends.

The food tastes like any CPK, so nothing really special if you go to CPKs a lot. The wait can take a while tho sometimes. They also are doing a deal--if you sign up for the CPK dough thing, you can get a free small plate.

Kira K.,"Honolulu, HI",34,79,36,3.0,3/14/2017,"CPKs on the island are so different!  This one is a small restaurant, tucked in a corner of a building next to pier one.  Driving by, we almost missed it- but I caught a glimpse of the yellow and black signage- and thought we should drop in for a quick lunch.   Parking here is good, lots of open stalls in the lot in back. We walked in and we were seated immediately.  Now, unlike most CPK restaurants that are large and very busy, this one is small and intimate.  Despite the size of the restaurant, the number of workers were plentiful- which means there really isn't much excuse for slow service.   I ordered a drink as soon as we sat, that drink never came.  The salad I ordered was missing the key ingredient in the BBQ chicken salad...the BBQ sauce.  (I was wondering why the salad was so bland---didn't realize it until I was nearly done eating) We were in a rush for a quick lunch and go, and it served the job, but not one well done.  Maybe another CPK next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=40

For a busy afternoon, our order came up fast and there was a much needed break between pupu's and our yummy pizza. We started with a small wedge salad- super tasty and rich with blue cheese. I was dying to try the newer Buffalo Cauliflower- it was incredible! No need the chicken, this was onolicious! Fried cauliflower, with a bit of breading and drenched in bbq sauce and blue cheese dressing. This is my new CPK favorite! The California Club Pizza was also a winner with plenty bacon, avocado, arugala, tomatoes, killer lemon mayo dressing all on a well done, crispy pizza crust.

I reminded the server that I requested the appetizer first, and she claimed she told the kitchen it needed to be  put out first but they didn't. Even if I hadn't, it's unacceptable to have the appetizer AFTER you're done with the main course. She never came by to ask how we were doing, and only came back later to ask if we wanted dessert.

The second one was 10x sweeter than the first. And our server, Who was very sweet, told us that the bartender gave her a dirty look when she asked her to go easy on the purée. So I chugged it because no one likes to waste alcohol. Then I ordered crispy Mac and cheese for my son, and was told it was cheesier than the kids menu MAC and cheese. That dish was overlooked and dry and totally inedible. My friend ordered a fettuccine and that was ok. And the avocado egg rolls were overcooked as well. Idk what's going on in the kitchen, but everything was just bad. No effort, no care.  The server did what she could, and its not her fault because she doesn't make the drinks or the food.

Emily N.,"Honolulu, HI",4,52,107,2.0,1/5/2018,"Most times, CPK is decent. Sadly, I believe they have been going downhill for a while now. (The pizzas have definitely shrank since they first opened). There are two reasons I am not giving them one star at the moment: 1) Their avocado egg rolls are always fabulous 2) The service is good I ordered take out from the Kailua CPK today, and the person I was speaking on the phone with took quite a long time just checking if they had avocado egg rolls available. When I arrived, the waitress that took care of my order was extremely nice and apologetic for making me wait (even though I knew I would have to wait since I was relatively early for a takeout order). My problem arose when I got home and opened my order of avocado egg rolls and the new ""small plate"" of spicy buffalo cauliflower. I understand that it is a ""small plate,"" but an order of spicy buffalo cauliflower totals to more than $8. With $8, I should be able to get a sufficient amount of crispy, fried cauliflower. I also understand that since I ordered take-out, the sauce will not be covering the cauliflower as it would be if I ordered in-house. Still, I have never seen a sadder looking appetizer. The cauliflower was weepy, there was not nearly enough pieces, and it all looked as if it had been hastily tossed into the takeout container. I will most likely be back because I enjoy their avocado egg rolls, BBQ chicken salad and kids curly mac & cheese. There are many good items on their menu, but the spicy buffalo cauliflower is not one of them (especially for take-out).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua
Lien V.,"Honolulu, HI",206,190,2942,2.0,11/15/2017,"----- Ambiance = 3 stars ----- Food = 3 stars -----Service = 1 star ----- ****  Overall  = 2.333 stars  **** (Disclaimer: I rarely take the time to write low-rating reviews but I'm making an exception especially for Kailua CPK) This CPK in Kailua is NO Ala Moana mall CPK (IMHO, it's the most efficient CPK on Oahu and I come to find out later this CPK is also a training center for all CPKs on Oahu). Whenever I'm  shopping at Ala Moana mall or in the vicinity, I've no hesitations eating at the mall's CPK.  However, when it comes to contemplating whether to eat at this Kailua CPK, I often find myself cursing myself for taking a chance at Kailua CPK. I feel like a gambler because the service here is so ""dicey"" - meaning I'm just ""rolling the dice"" here. My low rating is based on the number of visits I had at this location = 3 dine-ins and 2 take-outs. You'd think since this is a CPK Express, service would fared better and faster but that's not the case at all.    On my recent dine-in, the hostess walked me to my table (outdoor seating area) and provided   menu. After perusing throught it, I realized it has been at least 20 minutes and the waitress still has yet to acknowledge me nor come by since I got seated. Due to its small section, the only servicing (my) waitress walked passed me twice without batting an eye, a wince nor turned her head beyond her tunnel field of vision. Similar to witnessing zombie walk. It's like she's avoiding any eye contact as she kept repeatedly servicing the other 2 tables.      This was getting annoying as it was late and granted, the restaurant was not busy at 8 in the evening. So I decided to skip dealing with this person/employee. Hence, the bar seating was clear and seemed more inviting since the bartender probably would be more efficient (I'm hoping). She, (the bartender) was a little better than the waitress (I gave up on) so I was able to place my order. Bartender's service was minimally okay, nothing special, pleasant nor friendly. After 20 minutes, the kitchen informed her my lettuce wrap will be up soon. When the plate slid out, one could clearly see it was no shrimp lettuce wrap as I had ordered, it was chicken lettuce wrap. WTH - shrimp and chicken doesn't even sound alike even if you whispered it. The bartender punched in the order on their terminal system and yet, the wrong meat came out. So another 15 minutes went by before I got my correct dinner entree. What a bunch of non-reliable, low-work ethics employees we got here so far.  While enjoying my delicious lettuce wrap, 3 gentlemen arrived and sat down at the bar too. The  guy sitting closest to me apologized in advance if he's going to hit me accidentally when he swung his injured arm in my direction. It was not a problem as I didn't get hit but we ended up ""talking story"". Once the men put in their orders, the bartender started making their drinks and I noticed her hand was shaking pretty nervously and her facial expression says it all because you could easily tell the men were quite acquainted with her service or rather lack of service. There was no love lost between the bartender and these paddlers. So I asked, in exasperated tone, the one Kailua resident closest to me, ""Is the service here always bad""? He responded by throwing up his hands and replied ""Yes, service is bad here"". Ugh, I feel it too brother.  In one of my previous take-outs, this CPK was 20 minutes behind in fulfilling my take-out order. I was informed I could sit and wait while they catch up on their food orders.OMG, that is oxymoronic to the entire concept of take-out after the eatery tells you what time their take-out will be ready. Another bad dining episode I experienced at Kailua CPK plays out the same bad slow service tune where I ended up sitting at the bar. Acknowledgement and orders were basically non-existent and nonchalant. Granted, when I choose to dine at a chain-restaurant or eatery, it is for their food and customers do know and expect consistency of quality from the chain whereever the locations maybe.    What is it about the bad servicing issues here in Kailua CPK? Don't get me wrong, I've always loved eating CPK's food and always will. But the one CPK I intend on patronizing as a last resort is CPK in Kailua. Having dined at this Kailua CPK more than a few occasions, I basically have lowered my expectations and try to avoid eating here unless friends  insist on this CPK. An unfriendly staff with a lackadaisical attitude is no place for me nor anyone looking for a decent dining experience. Perhaps it's the isolation of its geography (located on the ""other side of the mountain"") which might (the only plausible reason I can deduced) explains the core reasons why this Kailua's CPK is consistently bad in the servicing department.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua

I think we came between the early crowd and the later crowd as a bunch of people were leaving and a bunch started to arrive after us.  The hostess was very friendly and tried to clear tables so she could sit us right away, but she was continually interrupted by having to return to the front entrance to meet the arriving customers. The tables were eventually cleared and we were seated in just a few minutes.  Our waiter apologized for taking so long to greet us, but we were too busy with the menu to notice. We ordered right away. The bread and olive oil were great. The wedge salad appetizer was also tasty and enough for us to share.  Our food arrived soon after. I had the works pizza and my wife had the rolled pasta with mushrooms. Both were very good.  I think one concern here is that the waiters are really working too hard. They are so busy running around that they do not have the time to be as attentive as they would like to be, although they are trying their best.

Tonite we started with the asparagus arugula salad and I swear the salad was sitting flat on the plate...same width, same length, just completely flat instead of the three dimensional salad we are used to to.  The next appetizer of white corn guacamole and chips came and again it looked like the guacamole was on a very strict diet!

We walked in and we were greeted right away with a smile. We had the option of choosing to eat inside or outside and on such a beautiful day here in Kailua, it would've been foolish to choose to eat inside. We were taken outside and greeted by our waitress about 60 seconds after we sat down. Our beverage orders were taken right away and water was brought out as we waited. Once our orders were placed our server, Melissa, offered to bring out my daughters fruit so she had something to snack on to keep her busy! Absolutely appreciated that!!!! I ordered her a Kids cheese pizza and I ordered myself the Carne Asada Pizza. For a cheese pizza that thing was pretty dang good!!! I've been to CPK before but this was my first time just taking a bite of a traditional cheese pizza. It was very flavorful and cooked perfectly!! My daughter loved it! She also enjoyed her side of grapes and pineapple! My Carne Asada Pizza actually blew my mind. The side of salsa verde that came with it impressed me way more than I thought it would. It was nice and spicy which I loved (the waitress did say it varies though so if you order expecting some ""fiyah"" [my obnoxious way of saying ""fire""] it doesn't mean you'll get it). After we enjoyed our pizza our waitress let us know that my daughters meal had a 99 cent sundae so I said to myself, ""Might as  well share a dessert with my lovely date!"" That was a pretty delectable sundae for being only 99 cents. Overall, my daughter and I had a great server, delicious food, and enjoyed the environment!

There was no cilantro and the dressing was gingery but everything lacked overall flavor. Now the service... we were seated right away which was a great start, but that was it.  They really seemed short staffed because the servers were literally and physically all over the place. I counted only 3 of them along with 2-3 bus help. I checked in thru their app so by the time we flagged the manager Peter, more than 15 minutes had gone by. (Maybe if he spent more time managing and observing tables rather than eating lunch and meeting with staff at the VERY NEXT TABLE, he would've noticed us sitting there without being touched). Our server Emily was great, just stretched thin. Food was served on time and she provided as good service as she could under the circumstances. During our lunch, the manager Peter was finishing his lunch meeting along with one of the chefs and another staff member. They were talking pretty loudly and we heard them talking about customer reviews (ironic, I thought lol) and how they could improve...duh, maybe just open your eyes and focus on the people already there.

It wasn't like we ordered several appetizers either.  My husband finally had to ask the manager what was going on with the appetizer before we received it.  Honestly this place needs better management. A customer shouldn't have to wait long in an empty restaurant.  The Ala Moana and Kahala locations are far busier and they turn out the food a lot faster.  The server we had was certainly friendly and enthusiastic, but she didn't come around all that much to check on us.  We could have used more water refills and a refill of the coffee, but we were going to have to send a search party to get someone to do those things.  The food is delicious. The food is consistently good at every CPK location I've been to. But the slow service colored the experience for us.  I doubt I'll dine at this location again though I might use their takeout/curbside service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua
Eri S.,"Kailua, HI",186,119,745,5.0,3/1/2017,"Thank you Krysten for making our dinner at CPK wonderful!   I stopped in around 9:30pm with my little one and we were seated, then promptly greeted by our friendly server Krysten and our drink orders were taken right away along with some great recommendations.  There are free refills on the flavored iced teas and strawberry lemonades so if you are really thirsty go for the flavored iced teas, or lemonade!  Since other specialty drinks are not refillable.  Although the fresh strawberry mango cooler is bubbly and really good, I would rather get refillable drinks.  Order the Buffalo cauliflower it's the tenderest most amazing vegetarian substitute to buffalo wings you can get.  The Avocado egg-rolls are really hearty too!  Also, when at CPK remember that the P stands for PIZZA. Because they have the Best pizza!!! Everything about it is so Fresh to def. The crust is soft, ever so lightly sweet and chewy. The marinara game is strong people. I'm sure that there's some legit cooking wine in there with all the mouth watering aromas. Also, their pizzas are obviously in house and made fresh to order. Even their keiki pizza are just as heavenly as the regular sized ones just miniature. My boys got the Hawaiian pizza and the Cheese pizza. My little one ate only half of his and this is a lot of pizza for a 1 year old so as most parents would do I finished his left overs (how could I let it go to waste?)  On my second visit I got the raspberry and mango flavored iced tea and it was the BEST!!!  I have no idea how service could have been better but it did on our second visit with. Our server from our second visit was even more attentive visit who went above and beyond with waters along with our ordered drinks, extra napkins at our request and a free ice cream with a lighted candle for my mom's birthday treat!!

Better step up your game, cause I won't be back & I can see others feel the same way.  Regardless of Hawaii's laid back vibe, if someone spills salad dressing all over the floor, you clean it up. You don't seat the next party at the table and ignore it! It was all over our shoes and it smelled bad. I cleaned our shoes as best I could & placed several napkins over the spill to contain it. I then explained to the hostess. She seated us elsewhere and I thought she would have the spill and the napkins cleaned up, but NO! She just seated another party at the table.  I asked our waiter for 4 waters (the # of people in our party). He brought two & checked on all other tables before taking our order, even bringing the other parties drink refills first.

The people at the tables would not leave and they didn't not ask them to leave (they were just chatting, not eating).  We were finally seated and then told the wait would be 35 minutes for food.Bread was not brought for 20 minutes. The salad did not have much avocado or chicken in it. I asked for more and she had to okay it with the manager before she brought it--this alone took at least 15 minutes.Finally they offered us a free appetizer.   Now everyone was very friendly, but I was not happy.  The restaurant apparently only has six burners and it cannot handle the amount of people the restaurant can hold. My biggest gripe is that they misjudged the time by so much and that it took them so long to notify us. We should have just left but I usually really enjoy CPK.  I guess I just need to change my location. I do think if we had had only four people our wait would have been much shorter.

We were seated tonight at about 6:30, ordered at 6:35,and got my food at 7:30.  My husband waited another 15 minutes before the server said his would be right up.  We asked for it to be packaged to go and it finally came 5 minutes later. Nearly an hour and a half to get our food.  Everyone in the restaurant was having the same problem and pretty upset at the long wait.  I will miss going there regularly and will need to find somewhere else to go on my weekly dinner out. Well decided to try again on 9/29/16.  Arrived at 6:00 pm and there were plenty of tables available.  This was probably due to the farmers market. We were seated immediately and this time our food came out to us within 20 minutes!  I am hoping they have fixed the food preparation issue for good and this wasn't just because it wasn't very busy.

Ceara K.,"Honolulu, HI",9,30,,1.0,7/21/2015,"Here we go.... I literally can't believe what a horrible experience we had at this restaurant. 1.  We were quoted 'a few minutes', we waited more than 30.  They promised us these two tables, although we didn't have a preference of where we sat... We just wanted to eat.  But they sat someone else there because suddenly they couldn't accommodate us there because there was a stroller? Whatever, I get it... My daughter is still in a stroller too.  So we wait AGAIN.  We finally get sat. 2.  Our server, Alex, had the techniques down.  Orders came out correctly.  We had everything we needed.  Drinks were full.  Speedy.  But he wasn't very personable.  He almost looked annoyed at us the whole time, but whatever.  I just wanted to eat so I could get to the bowling alley. 3.  Welllpppp folks, here it is.  I DO NOT EAT CPK'S CHICKEN because I don't care for the cuts or temperature they use.  I always forgo it, no matter what entree/salad I've chosen for the visit.  In fact, my sister (who is a vegetarian) always gets the same as me - BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad NO CHICKEN, sub avocado. So you're thinking I got chicken in my salad right? WORSE.  We don't even know what it was.  I yanked something out of my salad that I thought was cheese... Asked my family.  Then didn't think too much about it.... Out of pure curiosity, I asked our server... He said, ""oh, I think chicken, but let me go double check"".  At this point, I'm already annoyed because I don't like their chicken & I didn't want it!  Then he comes back & says, ""We've come to the conclusion that it was chicken."" Ok... Whatever.  But after thinking about it, IT DEFINITELY WAS NOT CHICKEN.  I asked the manager to come by & he was totally unprofessional.  He had no idea what he was doing.  He apologized, didn't offer an explanation, nor a remedy for the situation. When I engaged in conversation with him to try & find out what was in my salad (& what the avocado that I fed my daughter touched), he said ""yea, it was chicken skin"" WHAT?!??!?!??!!??! What does CPK use chicken skin in any of their dishes for?!?!? yea nothing!!! HOW DISGUSTING! Appalled & nauseated, I asked him if it was cooked because it definitely didn't looked cooked.  It was falling apart - which we all know ""chicken skin"" doesn't do.... He just said yea. I was over it - wanted to leave.  They offered free desserts, but being that I was already feeling nasty & didn't want chicken skin, or what they think was chicken skin to be part of my dessert, I kindly declined.  They comped my salad - but that was it. I left with a VERY sour taste in my mouth for this CPK in particular.  This would NEVER have happened at Kahala.  I will not be returning to this CPK any time soon, or ever actually.

My meal came out 25 minutes before the other 2 so that already was uncomfortable.

After the food arrived my husbands pizza was not what he ordered, plus there was scraps of mushrooms & some other mysterious food on the plate the pizza came on.

Ryan W.,"Honolulu, HI",37,15,2,2.0,7/26/2015,"Most of this review is regarding the service I experienced.  Only a small portion of this review describes our meal.   Our family decided to celebrate my brother's birthday party by heading to CPK in Kailua at around 6:30p.  We arrived expecting a wait (it was dinner time, there were 7 of us total, and they do not accept reservations).  When we checked in at the desk, the greeter explained that the wait was going to be about 30-35 minutes and gave us our pager.  All 7 of us were present  and patiently waiting right by the water fountain.   30 minutes have passed...we may get called to go in soon.  We see some smaller parties who checked in after us getting seated before us.  Understandable - we had a large group. 5 minutes later...again more smaller parties get seated.  Again we understand. 5 minutes later...we see the staff arranging some outside tables for a large party.  ""Could it be us?"" we thought.  Unfortunately not.  Another large party of about 6-8 goes gets called to it.  That's okay.  We will continue to wait patiently by the fountain for our buzzer to vibrate. 5 minutes later...we were the only party waiting by the fountain.  We should be called very soon. 10 minutes passed...a total of 55 minutes pass and we still haven't been called.  We check back in with the greeter to see about how much longer it will be. When we checked back in, the greeter told our party that we didn't claim our table when the pager went off (in other words, placing the blame on us).  Wait a minute.  We were sitting right outside by the water fountain and had the pager with us the entire time.  The pager did not flash or vibrate during our entire wait.  Trust me, we wanted the d*mn thing to go off!   She also claims that she came out to call out our party name (again, blaming us).  Uh excuse me?!  We were, at one time, the only party waiting for seats.  Not once did any staff member call out to any waiting parties. Some of us were thinking going to another restaurant after the greeter told us that.  But the manager took over the situation, apologized to us, and offered to give us the next available tables.  We accepted. A few minutes later, we were lead to our table where a waiter greets us and asks if we would like any drinks.  A few minutes later, a waitress comes to the table, greets us, and asks us the same question.  There must've be some miscommunication going on since two staff members asked us what we wanted to drink.  But that's okay (it was a large party anyway).  The waiter did not return to our table after the initial introduction. Even though we were still upset that we waited longer than we were suppose to, the service at the tables was great.  Our waitress was upbeat and knowledgeable.  She served us very well and continued to check on us during our meal.  She encouraged someone in our party to get the Jambalaya, but get it with spaghetti noodles instead of the usual fettuccine.  He happily agreed.  Unfortunately the cooks served it with the usual fettuccine noodles.  He just decided not to make it a big deal and just ate it anyway.   Usually when I order the pasta here, it kinda erks me that I usually get a piece of another noodle that is not suppose to be part of my dish.  This time was no different.  I ordered the Kung Pao Spaghetti and had a piece of penne in my meal. Though our experience at CPK ended well (except for the small screw ups), we wish it only started that way too.  Sure we may go back, but it may be a little while before we decide to do so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=120

Jasmine W.,"Honolulu, HI",149,202,196,4.0,6/24/2015,"I came here for a late lunch last week with co-workers, as we had just finished some field work in the Kailua area. We were all pretty passive on where we wanted to go, so CPK was a good and simple choice for us.  We got to the restaurant around 12:40pm on a Wednesday and the hostess told us it would be a 15-20 minute wait for a party of four. We opted for the first available table, since they have both indoor and outdoor seating. When we were buzzed back about 20 minutes later, they let us choose between indoor and outdoor - we chose indoor because we had been standing in the sun for the past few hours and were all pretty hot, and the AC inside seemed like it would be nice (and it was!). I had the California Club sandwich and opted for the side of Caesar salad instead of a cup of soup (again, my decision was driven by the weather/temperature outside...the soup sounded good!), and another coworker also got this same combo. The others got fish tacos and a BBQ chicken pizza. I learned to love the CA Club sandwich during my USC days, when I would use my dining dollars (or my sister's dining dollars) to go to the CPK to-go that was in the new Campus Center. This was my first time ordering the sandwich in an actual CPK and it seemed so much bigger than the to-go version I remembered! Unlike the version I was used to (where the whole sandwich was stuffed in a plastic take-out container), the bread on this sandwich was nice and warm, and the chicken and avocado were perfectly chilled. The Caesar salad was good but nothing out of the ordinary - I liked that the croutons were extra crunchy! Because I tend to eat small lunches, I finished only the side salad and 1/2 of the sandwich, and kept the other 1/2 of my sandwich for lunch the following day. It was a great portion size, especially for one of the lighter, more reasonable items on their extensive menu! The service was very good which made it a great experience! Our waters were always full, our waitress came back a couple of times to check up on us, and she even offered to split our check four ways (yes...we didn't even have to ask!). This is a great CPK, especially for those that live on the Windward side of the island, for a good simple lunch with great service.

Shannon W.,"Kailua, HI",4,40,12,2.0,10/17/2016,"We moved to Kailua 2 months ago and decided to try CPK with our two children. Our first visit was so-so, but we figured it was an off night so we decided to try again. We were seated and didn't see our server for quite awhile. No water or bread was ever served. We ordered drinks and some mac-n-cheese balls for the kids. Our server had the sourest face--she never smiled at all. It appeared as if she was trying not to come over to our table or others in our section. She finally came over to tell us they were out of mac-n-cheese balls. Everything we were served was served first to the table next to us by accident: the drinks, the kids food and our meals. It got to the point where I'd just wave to the runner to let him know the food was for us. The food was not fresh. It had sat awhile. My pesto pasta was hard and sticky, no sauce at all. My husbands was dry too. The kids didn't even eat theirs. The only thing we enjoyed was the bread which we asked the runner for and finally received. We hardly saw our server other than when she was standing at the computer avoiding eye-contact with us. The people next to us were not served at all and I did see the manager or someone come and offer to comp part of their meal. I'm not sure what exactly was going on but for the price we paid for this meal, it was not worth the service or food.

There was 5 of us and a baby non of us liked our food and barely ate any. I got a raspberry lemon drop and it was extremely strong. My friend got the jambalaya pasta, we all tasted it and agreed it was overly seasoned, I fettuccine with red sauce and added chicken, the chicken wasn't cooked all the way and the noodles were undercooked. Her husband got a person pizza and only ate one slice. My husband got spaghetti with meat sauce and he was starving and couldn't even finish it. His friend got fish tacos and said he hated them. The only reason we went there was because it was a two hour wait at Mexico lindos for cinco de mayo. Bad idea, I don't think I will be returning.

It pisses me off because what if I had an emergency or a bill to pay, I'm not able to access that extra $100 until the problem is corrected. Needless to say I'm not a happy camper.

Male hostess: young Caucasian boy upbeat, good personality .   Guy doing the take out orders behind the cash stand. Button up long sleeve. LAME Looks soooo bored. Low energy looks like it takes him a lot of concentration and energy to weigh and bag chips. Yawning in mid process while bagging the little bags of chips. ( must be heavy for him to carry) the only time he perks up is when one of the cute waitresses comes in his station. Answering phone with s bored tone.  Food: over priced for the quality we got. Tasted okay . kahala cpk way better.  Server : some were really good and friendly. Our waiter was okay I guess not really attentive . Need to pay more attention to detail.  Ordered lettuce wraps and only got 3 lettuce with a platter full of filling . REALLY! I had to ask for more lettuce. That's super lame! I'm still confused about who thought to put three pieces of lettuce for a platter full of filling. I don't get it. I can't believe how lame that was. I'd go so far as to say idiotic.

I have a few food allergies, and he really knows the details of each dish. he always keeps an eye on the table, if your ice tea is empty he is right there, if you are looking around for something, he nips over, if it's a messy item, he brings extra napkins.  Order one dessert for three of you, he brings the extra spoons. You don't have to ask for everything, it makes the meal so relaxing. he is really personable and polite and just a great addition to any meal at the Kailua CPK.  I probably suppose I should do a separate review for their curbside pickup.  if I did, the stars would be maybe a 1. often get take away when I am in town visiting family, every six weeks, and in the 20 or so times I have gotten take out, I would say 90% of the time! I am missing not least one item or the item is wrong. I always ask too for them to review it. Makes no difference. I would also say the same percentage applies to extraordinary wait times.

Then we were ignored for nearly an hour. After spending a day on the beach, we were all pretty hungry despite it being early.  Our bread and water were devoured in seconds.  No refills were offered, no one checked up on us to see how we were doing.  FOR AN HOUR!  The Ala Moana, Kahala, and Pearlridge locations are far busier, and yet the servers are attentive and the food comes out in a timely manner. The food - when it finally arrived - was really disappointing.  The pastas were cold - the mac 'n cheese sauce was starting to develop a layer of film across the top (well it would if it were sitting for an hour).  The $4.00 add on of chicken to the pesto cream penne amounted to a meager two small slices of chicken.  The wild mushroom pizza looked as if they had taken chicken chunks from their salad bar and strewn them across the top of the pizza after they baked it.  The large, square chicken chunks just rolled off of the slices of pizza as I tried to eat.

First BAD experience: ordered Kid's Mac n cheese for my 4 yr old daughter, as I was blowing it to cool it off, I found a STAPLE in it!! Mind you, I understand they have staples on their produce bags, etc...however, I feel they should have been more careful. I was NICE about it and alerted the manager quietly, so I would not affect other customers. He was ok, gave us 2 out of our 4 meals free. Ok...1st strike... Second BAD experience: Ordered their Kid's Mac n cheese AGAIN for my daughter and this time, found misc. items like bell peppers, green beans and a few other veggies that ""accidentally"" found their way in there. I don't mind veggies, but if you order something that is NOT supposed to have it, it is quite a surprise to find it in there!! 2nd strike.... LAST BAD EXPERIENCE: Just this past Saturday (12/8/12) @ approx. 5 pm, we walked in and were seated right away (they were not busy at all). The hostess brpught our menus and said our server would be right with us. There were 3 adults and 2 kids in our party this time.  We browsed the menus as our kids drew on their menus, then after about 30 minutes or so, NO ONE coming by to ask us if we had any questions, wanted water, etc....we thought, ""Hmmmm....why did the people that came in AFTER us already get their appetizers and drinks??""

Everything was delicious as usual at that time. When I went home, I felt something strange in my stomach and found myself THROWING UP THREE TIMES and going to the bathroom to relieve myself NUMEROUS TIMES as well as gaining a FEVER and CHILLS. My guess is that I got food poisoning. The symptoms are almost similar to the stomach flu, as it is flu season right now. I had to unfortunately miss TWO days of work because of this sickness! And I REALLY NEEDED the money! I could barely eat anything on Saturday and the sight of food made me sick on Sunday! I feel a little better today, but I still cannot eat as much food as I would like.  I will be writing a complaint to this CPK.

I think they're actually robots that are digitally programmed to keep moving, smiling and be friendly! Anyways, stellar service towards their customers here.  I really can't complain about their menu selection...I've had most of their pizzas on the menu and like all of them. The avocado pizza though is a little difficult to eat since they lay thick slices of avocado on the pizza, so it becomes a mouthful when attacking it. Their specialty plates are okay (I've had the salmon which was fair) but their pizzas are a million times better, especially if you ask for your pizza to be made with the honey wheat dough. The food is always hot and the appetizers are always tasty. They got some good creative minds behind these CPK dishes. My favorite dessert is the pumpkin cheese cake special they had back in the fall.  Sign up for their emailings so you can get monthly specials and coupons. Also, they have weekly drawings for people to win a giftcard worth some crazy amount, like $500 in CPK food I think?

Like most Germans, he is to the point. When it comes to dinner time he has little tolerance for Asian food. He barks: No Japanisisch! No Vietnamisch! No Koreanisch! No Chinesisch! That leaves a total of two restaurants left in Kailua and one is Peppinos (I don't even have the English skills to try to explain that place to him.) CPK it is. Parking is okay if you don't mind walking a quarter mile in a creepy parking lot. Our party of four arrives around 8 and its CROWDED. German brother in law complains about the noise level inside so request an outside table. 15 minute wait. We were seated outside by a nice local young man. He was explaining the new Peking Duck Pizza they are offering in his normal local tone. Halfway through German brother in law roars EXCUSE ME! I DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SAYING! Local guy kept his cool and started again with my wife and I pointing at pictures of the thing. *Awkward tension* Waitress comes. She is a nice lady and has a loud voice. Whew. She helps my German brother in law through the menu patiently. By the way, he hates mushrooms too.  He orders a Sam Adams. Waitress bring him a frosty mug. He barks: NO GLASS TOO COLD! *Awkward tension*  He is a brewer by trade and likes his beer warm. Wait staff all over our great island are consistently perplexed by this. Appetizer comes. Spinach artichoke dip. Germans are happy. Wife and I share grilled salad and vege pizza. Germans get BBQ chicken salad and his wife gets Chinese Chicken salad. Dinner for 4=60 bucks.

Asako O.,"Honolulu, HI",58,212,,5.0,7/30/2012,"This California Pizza Kitchen is one of my favorite places to stop by for lunch whenever I am visiting Kailua. It is conveniently located in the heart of Kailua town with plenty of free parking available and easy to find as it is located right next door (ewa) to Macy's.   I find that the atmosphere at this location is nice as it provides a quiet and relaxing setting which is perfect for dining.  My favorite of all CPK's salads is the one and only original bbq chicken chopped salad (without avocado). Depending on how hungry I am will determine whether I will order half or full order of this popular salad. Since I was not feeling too hungry, it was going to definitely be the half order.  Even though the half portion did not look like much on my plate, it actually filled me up. This salad was generously coated with their special dressing which you can taste with every bite.     Since I have a sweet tooth I was not about to pass up dessert. It was time once again to order the butter cake for $6.75. I highly recommend ordering this specialty dessert as you will not be disappointed. To top off this cake, for an extra $1.50 you can enjoy it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. This butter cake is served warm with fresh whipped cream and best shared with two people as it is a very large serving. It is light, buttery and will literally melt in your mouth. Soooo delicious! In my book, this ""takes the cake""! CPK's food as well as the service received was excellent as our waitress came around to check up on us and also made sure our ice tea glasses were always filled.   This is one restaurant where I will definitely visit again whenever I am in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=180

Corey A.,"Kailua, HI",22,4,,1.0,12/15/2013,"I went here tonight expecting it to be pretty decent but NOPE. Everything tonight went wrong, and my family and I will NEVER be returning back again. After this experience, this place is a turn-off. If I could rate this place a 0, I would in a heartbeat. Even though we live in Kailua (5 minute drive), a 25 minute drive to Pealridge's CPK is totally worth it.  1. Overpriced OKAY food plus JUNK service = NEVER COMING BACK (not worth your time and money). 2. The waiter we had was NEGLIGENT/SLACKING/TERRIBLE: 3. The manager was the WORST/UNPROFESSIONAL. 4. The chips that came with the spinach artichoke dip was STALE and the proportion of dip to chip was off (we ran out of stale chips when there was half the dip left). 5. After I finished eating my chicken cobb salad (lettuce, boiled eggs, blue cheese, tomatoes, bacon, grilled chicken breast, and avocado) there was a random piece of grilled corn that was underneath my salad. Reasons for #2: 2A. He treated everyone else so well and making small conversations to them EXCEPT us. He rarely comes back to check on us, and isn't even a bit friendly like how he is to everyone around us.  2B. My mom ordered a salad and said no tomatoes in it, and when he brought it out she noticed it also had sun dried tomatoes, so she asked him nicely if she could get a new one without any tomatoes and sun dried tomatoes. He didn't even apologize for the mishap. He made an upset facial expression, took the salad, and walked away. 2C. After my mom asked for a new salad he became even more negligent and unfriendly to us, and he was talking to us so monotone and not making eye contact, plus I could tell that he didn't want to service us even more. 2D. He was no where to be found and never check back with us to talk about the update of the new salad the chefs were making. So we waited for another 10 minutes without anyone stopping by to check up on us and when he finally came by, he was clearing off another table so my mom was so impatient/upset about the negligent service, she said to cancel the order already and we wanted the check. He said okay and walked away. 2E. He came back 5 minutes later and said ""oh the manager is going to come and give you the salad in a to go box."" What wasn't clear about canceling the order, and to give us the check? We didn't even ask for the manager at all, we just wanted to pay and leave. But NOPE. Reasons for #3: 3A. I'm guessing the waiter made a big deal about my mom's mistake of having the sundried tomatoes in the salad so that's probably why the manager came by to talk to us I guess. We didn't ask for the manager or anything, my mom again, just asked nicely for a new salad without tomatoes and sun dried tomatoes in it. But the manager approached us the WRONG way.  3B. He came by and asked my mom ""What's wrong?"" and my mom was wondering who this guy was so she said ""what?"" like any person would. and he then said "" There was sun dried tomatoes in your salad?"" and she replied ""OH, Yes, I told the waiter that I don't want any tomatoes in the salad since I get acid reflux from eating it"" and then the manager goes ""oh, okay"" and walks away. HOW STRANGE: FIRST, he didn't properly introduce himself or anything (so we didn't know who he was), and SECOND, he didn't apologize for the mishap (as the manager the first thing you should do besides introducing yourself is apologizing for the mistake; DUH).  3C: Since the waiter didn't want to service us anymore the manager took over. So we asked for the check and then 5 minutes later the waiter told us that the manager is coming with the salad in a to-go-box. and then the manager arrived. 3D. He placed the package on the table and crouched down to talk to my mom. He said in a FAKE calm/sad voice ""I'm so sorry for the mistake, I hope that you come back to eat here again."" and my mom said ""No, I'm never coming back here again. The service was terrible."" and he said ""I know.."" My mom then replied ""Even though we live in kailua, we'll drive to pearl ridge and eat at that restaurant instead from now on."" And he didn't answer back and paused for a bit, got up, and then grabbed us the check. My mom paid through a gift card, and then he came back to give us the receipt, and walked away. And while we walked out he said to us ""I hope you have a better evening............And happy holidays!"" LIKE REALLY, REALLY?  After all that terrible service, he said he knows about it?? and then while we were leaving he said ""hope you have a better evening and happy holidays""!?! This place is a joke.

Which we all know and understand. Except I didn't feel I got enough food for the price. $11 for half a cob salad should still be a decent size. Not here. $5 cup of soup should at least be hot. Not here. I could pay $3 more for a pizza at Pizza Bob's down the street, take it home, have it feed 2 people easily AND be able to have a conversation.  And that is what I'll do in the future.

First of all I don't care what it is it shouldn't be in my pasta so keep your excuses to yourself. Second of all that is a lie because butter brush bristles are not long and curly and nobody brushes butter on pasta the butter is cooked in the sauce. As if things couldn't get worse the manager came by and said ""I'm so sorry for the miscommunication"". WHAT!? There wasn't a miscommunication there was a big nasty hair in my food.

But a month ago and more recently tonight, I dined at CPK ASAP in Kailua and was pleasantly surprised...probably because I didn't expect the place to wow me nor the food to thrill me.  The place is incredibly popular, filled with mostly families with young children (probably because they have mac and cheese on their menu) and a smattering of visitors and locals alike.  We arrived before the crowd hit so got a seat immediately inside at a table in a nice corner with a fair amount of space.  I ordered a veggie sandwich on a garlic and cheese foccacia with aioli sauce, roasted red peppers, mixed greens and eggplant was actually fairly decent. While difficult to eat (the sandwich is cut in half and has roasted veggies and lettuce oozing out), it does taste good going down!  You can choose from a salad or a soup (I elected to try the pea soup) to accompany your meal. The soup was lukewarm but I was hungry so I ate it anyway!  My dad ordered his regular, a pepperoni, sausage and mushroom pizza; my mom her regular, garlic fettuccine with shrimp and chicken; and of course my daughter, HER favorite, mac and cheese!

She must have spoken to her other staff me ever a regarding the issue because the rest of the night everyone offered premium service! I was impressed at everyone's effort to turn an unpleasant situation into a great experience. From that point forward everyone was super attentive and helpful. We were given complementary appetizers, desserts, and 2 ""Be Our Guest"" cards gifting us a free entree and drink at our next CPK visit. For our free appetizer we tried the Cajun Chicken Tortilla Rolls which were delicious! And for our free dessert, Tiramisu, which was creamy fab and just melted in your mouth!

One bottle of beer and a glass of sangria should not be difficult on a slow monday evening.  Spinach and Artichoke dip: Extremely greasy and had a disproportionate amount of chips for the small amount of dip included. BLT pizza: Tasted like a BLT sandwich you could make at home - nothing exciting, interesting, or overly tasty about it. Kung Pao Spaghetti: Didn't taste as greasy as it looked. Good but not great. Because it was so greasy the peanuts (which were not chopped) could not adhere to the pasta and thus were left almost entirely to the end of the dish. Brownie Sundae: Served, again, more than 20 mins after ordering. Easily the WORST I've EVER tasted. Stale, nasty brownie, melted yet freezer burned, 'gritty' ice cream, chocolate fudge that somehow managed to have the consistency of a charleston chew, and stale walnuts that tasted like they'd been left uncovered for months which consequently left the generic, over-processed cool whip also tasting rancid. Dessert was comp'd on account of being late not DISGUSTING. Service: Our server seemed incompetent, new, or both.

Our food came out pretty quickly --- as it should because it used to be a CPK express.   I opted for the Chinese Chicken Salad :)  One of my favorites.  I like the chicken because it's always so tender, and there's not too much sauce and not too little.  It's a really perfect combination.  I didn't finish the whole salad (I never get halves of anything.  Go big or go home), so I took the rest home ... and right when I walked into the door my mom said: ""Oh is that from CPK?"" and stares at me with her longing eyes.  So I gave the rest of my salad to her. Thomas finished his iced tea in the middle of his meal, but no one brought or even asked if he wanted a refill.  I got a water, but Thomas only got an iced tea.  So he was pretty screwed.   I don't know how long we waited for the check.  The place was almost empty, and we saw the servers/bussers just standing in a circle talking story.  We tried staring at them to get their attention, but they seemed unamused by us.   Finally our check came, and Thomas's iced tea refill came.  Too late already breh!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=200
Thomas O.,"Honolulu, HI",1291,346,1018,2.0,6/16/2011,"I am disappointed with the unsatisfactory service my friend and I received here last night.  Nicole K. and I had decided before we went to work that we were going to CPK as a treat afterwards. (Of course I forget my rewards card but who cares, I'll be getting one tonight...well, little did I know this location dishes out long waits, shitty service (aka no service) and no rewards cards!) We arrived at 8:00 to find they are packed with a 30 minute wait time (on a Tuesday this is strange, but this store is smaller than most of the other locations on island.)  While waiting we sat next to the hostess booth, we overheard a family complaining to the hostesses that he could have gotten better service from them instead of their server. For some reason they had messed up orders and plates dropped...dumb stuff that shouldn't happen basically. All right, planny chain restaurants get those kine problems but they fix them. Right? Well, our server according to my receipt was a guy named Kealoha. (Did we get any Aloha while dining here? Nope.)  We got our drinks very quickly; a miller lite for Nicole and and Iced Tea for me. But where's the sugar. On the verge of hysteria I shuffle around the table looking for my sugar. I NEED MY SUGAR. 2 minutes later, the dish of sugar packets is nearly shoved in my face. Yes, I finally start breathing again. But please be nice about it Kealoha.  Then we waited what seemed like forever and a day for our food to come out. By now its 845 and we're starving. At least offer us some of your famous sourdough bread and buttah to carry us over.  But no. No bread. No buttah. Our food was delicious though. That made me quite happy until I ran out of iced tea.  So we finished what we planned to eat and started staring and random servers. You know the ""I want my effin check now"" stare because our server had be AWOL for the duration of our meal. Uncool! Finally he came around to collect our plates and serve me another Iced Tea. I wasn't about to touch it because it took way too long and without apology.  I may sound snooty right now but when you're earning a tip, at least try to make an effort.  To top off one of the worst experiences I've had at a CPK restaurant is the absence of our customer appreciation card. For the past 3 summers or so, CPK has been giving out these little cards that contain rewards. You're supposed to bring them back on your next visit to open them, revealing what you've won. The last one I got was 10% off my entire meal. This time I went home without a customer appreciation/loyalty reward card. I guess I'm not an appreciated customer. I guess the tables directly next to us and behind us were appreciated because they got cards.  In all, I think they can do better and will continue to go here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=200

I get to the Kailua CPK, park and walk inside, and told the hostess or waitress (not sure what she was) that I was picking up a take-out order. The girl took me to the take out counter, but had no idea how to ring me out. She wanted to charge me again when I'd pre-paid for my order online. Another employee showed her where the tickets for takeout orders were and I signed the credit card receipt. She tells me my order wasn't ready quite yet and it would be a few more minutes. I thought ""hey I ordered about a half hour ago! The app said my order would be ready in 20 minutes and I gave them extra time!"" but having experience working in customer service, I didn't want to fuss. I sat and waited for about 20 more minutes before standing up and having the same girl ask me if I'd been helped. I told her I was waiting for my takeout order. She called someone to help me who pulls my pizza out of a warmer. It had been ready the whole time I was waiting!!! I was so irritated. I mentioned it to the guy and he rolled his eyes as if the girl did that all the time and apologized. The girl who helped me originally didn't even check if my food was ready!!!!

We asked about the third salad - to which the waitress said - there was a delay because they were making fresh balsamic dressing??? Then we asked about the appetizer -later that came out in fourth place.  We had to ask about the missing salad again and was offered that it be boxed to be taken home instead - which, at that point sounded like a good idea. We ordered one dessert item to be shared- which did not take long to be brought to our table by another server working in the same section and after digging in - our waitress walked up to our table with the salad all boxed up and ready to go - except she held ANOTHER dessert - which wasn't meant to make up for the earlier mix ups - she was just as baffled as we were- and threw in the towel at that point.  But being the only bright spot of the evening - she left it with us - On The House.  My opinion - Hey Kitchen guyz - ""You Killin' us Servers out here!!""   2 Stars because the waitress did the best she could with the bad hand she was dealt.

While she was taking off the lettuce she found a dead fly under the lettuce. I called the waitress over, and she said ""did that just get there"", pretty much accusing us of putting the fly there. I told her to take that pizza off my bill, and once again I guess whoever the night manager was, it took forever for her to give me back the bill.

Bill T.,"Kaaawa, HI",5,30,,4.0,11/6/2009,"Last spring a friend was in town and one night we just wanted a quick and simple meal.  We went into town and ordered take-out from CPK.  It's not my favorite pizza.  I've had it before in several locations in California.  The owners took a great idea (from a restaurant * in Foster City, CA) and made it their own.  It never has lived up to the original, but still, it's decent food.   We ordered a pizza and bread, and were told it would be, what, 1/2 hour?  It was a nice night so we walked around a bit and just hung out until it was time.  We went back and inquired about our pizza only to have the woman helping us look very confused and excuse herself for a minute.  The store manager came back and apologized profusely.  She said that our order had not been given to the kitchen, so it hadn't even been started.  If we still wanted to wait, she would comp the entire meal.  I'm sorry, but wow.   Pay attention business owners and managers, THAT'S how you keep your customers.  If you screw up, and it happens to all of us, make a grand gesture like that, or even a smaller gesture, but do something.  I've had far too many places screw up and not even make a small attempt to retain my business.  If we'd been in a hurry I suppose we would have been at least a little bit upset, but we weren't, so we weren't.  Like I said it was a beautiful night, so we went back outside for a while.  We lost nothing and the local CPK gained a favorable review from me. * The restaurant in Foster City, CA, was Pacific Gourmet Pizza.  The original owners sold it years ago, and while the pizza was still really good after that, I have no idea if it still is.  I don't even know if it's still owned by the same people who bought it from the original people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=240

Instead of coming to our table at that moment, she finished her conversation with her friends and then came over.  We told her we were waiting for bread.  Needless to say, we received the bread after we were served our lunch.   Terrible service.

Aaron K.,"Kailua, HI",317,57,31,3.0,3/26/2011,"Food: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Organization: 3/5 Atmosphere: 3.5/5 This is really going to be a mixed review. I have been to several CPK locations on both Oahu and in California, but I have never taken the time to actually analyze multiple aspects of this chain restaurant before. This time, I decided to pay a little more attention to detail and actually see if there are any improvements that could be done to this place. First off, the food. The food actually isn't that bad. Size proportions in comparison to price are decent though like most places, if you decided to make it on your own from scratch, it would save you a few bucks here and there. Haha. However, it's not too unreasonable when you want a nice little luncheon or dinner with friends and family. I will say that the pizzas and pastas are flavorful to a decent degree, but there is usually a smidge of a spice or sauce that is lacking that might actually bring the dish to life. But that's personal preference. Overall, the food is good. A must try is the Original BBQ Chicken Salad. That is amazing! The service was really good when my mom and I stopped in as far as the hostess and the waitress at the bar were concerned. They were amazing and very friendly and took responsibility when they forgot something. It was during lunch time so business was busy. Which then leads me to the organization. For some reason I got this sense that there was very little communication between the staff. One big peeve was how the expediters were more into their conversation than making sure the food was presentable and getting them out to the customers in a timely fashion. Our food actually was sitting there for a good 10 minutes or longer before the waitress (who had been running around taking care of her other customers) had to ask them to take the food to us. While the food was still good, the Baja Fish Tacos we ordered were a bit soggy on the bottom which is from a combination of the sauce that is put on top and the fact that they were waiting on the table for a while. The atmosphere is very nice and the restaurant is clean for the most part with both an inside and outdoor component so that way you can choose your environment. However, it was the confusion that I sensed that day that really didn't make it all too much of a comfortable eating environment but it's not totally unpleasant either. All in all, I'm willing to go back there for a simple meal with friends and family again. I just won't be expecting customer service that's going to blow me out of the water all around. Just from a few people who actually care about their job. But I do look forward to going back and experiencing some of their other dishes, especially the new ones.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=240

BBQ pizza was small compared to other CPK's.  Taste was not as good.  Kinda dry and it had a funny smell.  Price was the same as other CPK's so smaller pizza, same price makes this pizza more expensive. Spinach dip was okay.  Chips were stale so not that good. Garlic Pasta was good.  I liked the sauce and the chicken. No real service so we didn't tip much.  We had to get our own drinks and bus the table. Prices were pretty expensive.  They made this place a take out counter style restaurant so no free bread, seat yourself, get your own beverage and they charge the same as a regular CPK.  So price is expensive.  You miss out on all the extras.  We spent around $28 for the 2 of us on 3 dishes. I don't talk about environment too much, but this restaurant has the feeling of being dirty.  I did not feel clean while eating here.  Maybe if I ate outside it would have been better.

Well our waitress informed us that she has been working there for 3 years and she has never heard of that.  6. After insisting she ask a manager she learned her lesson. The customer is always right.

Desirée H.,"Kailua, HI",14,12,,3.0,3/22/2011,This is the first time I have been to this chain restaurant. I have seen California Pizza Kitchen in other cities and have never been before. My husband and I went on a Sunday night and it was slow. We ordered an appetizer though and got that and our food literally minutes later maybe 3 or 4. The waitress kept apologizing but she gave it us and by the time we ate our food 15 min later it was cold. I got pasta so the cold pasta didn't taste that great. I would have rather they left the food under a heat lamp even rather than bringing our food out right after our appetizer. We even ordered our appetizer when she first came to the table and then ordered our food after that the next time.  I don't send food back anymore because to be honest I don't know what will happen to it if I do.  She really didn't come back until the end to ask if everything was ok. When she did I told her that our food was cold by the time we got to eat it and I'm sure it could have been better had it been hot. She just apologized again and  did nothing about it. Maybe she was just new but I would expect at least a free desert or something next time minimum. I would think a chain restaurant would have done something more than nothing. That is just my opinion. Oh and I will never go back here. I could get a frozen meal and stick in the microwave for the same taste and spend way less. I gave my opinion to the manager who called me and offered us free dinner if we came back to try them again. It was a very nice gesture. I think the food was ok the second time.

Kendal J.,"Honolulu, HI",14,37,16,4.0,5/28/2015,"SERVICE SCORE!!!!! I am giving this CPK location 4 stars. The food was just so so but the service was on point. Egg roles were worth the calories but the club sandwich is worth passing up. Kids meals were perfectly proportioned but a little pricey when you factor in pizza, fruit cup, & ice cream cup.  Mike ""Sides"" was outstanding! If I could have him work for my company I would snatch him up in a heartbeat. He anticipated and delivered everything we could have ever needed and with a 4 year old to entertain, that alone speaks volumes. Everything out of this guys mouth was extremely witty and fun. He definitely made our night. Thank you!  Make sure to ask to be seated in his section!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=140
Joy N.,"Honolulu, HI",343,215,78,4.0,2/25/2013,"CURB SIDE PICK UP!! =)  We ordered take out from CPK in Kailua this past weekend and were pleasantly surprised that they offer curb side pick up!  The CPK is located next to Macys in Kailua.  When we placed the order, they started to ask us about the color/type of car we drive so we asked why they needed this info.  Apparently, there were 2 reserved stalls right outside the restaurant that you can park at if you do take out.  Simply call the restuarant when you arrive to the stall and they will bring out your order AND take care of payment.  I thought this was such a nice touch since their parking is limited in the area and I could see how picking up could be a pain.  Wish all the CPK locations offered this service.  Definitely a plus!! Food tasted good as usual!  My garlic cream fettucine was extra good tho!  I noticed that certain CPK's cook the sauce differently, but I LOVE the way they cooked it =) Delicious!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=140

Gerardo H.,"La Puente, CA",88,59,26,4.0,11/1/2015,Well its a small cpk to begin with so there are times where you have to wait for a table.

Lyn D.,"Honolulu, HI",1,36,18,3.0,11/29/2015,"This place was alright for my first visit. I got the chicken Margarita fettuccine, or whatever it's called. I'd say it's really expensive for the portion given. But I'd give the taste of the pasta itself a 3.4 star out of 5. It costed me $16, and it should of been $10-$12. I could get a lot more with that kind of money at Bucca's or The Cheesecake Factory for a 4 star meal in my opinion.   The wait wasn't long at all, they didn't seem too busy. The waitress was very polite and nice. Tended to us often so it was great not having to track someone down to get us refills.  I'm giving a 3 because they don't have an option of half a star. They are definitely not a 4, nor near it. It's an alright place to go, not some fancy omg I have to go here its a total foodgasm resteraunt. Probably won't go here again for a loooong time.

The service was good - very attentive server.  The food was tasty as well. Love the Spinach artichoke dip and Chicken caesar sandwich. My only complaint is something that is an organizational issue not unique to this location. The suggested tip amount on the bottom of the check calculated based on teetotal including tax.  It should be on the subtotal since the tax is an add on, not reflective of the service, and varies by county and state.  Please look into changing this.  It's deceptive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=140
Grace M.,"Waimanalo, HI",60,2,,1.0,3/12/2016,"I have always enjoyed CPK, since the '90's. The last time I was here in Kailua CPK was 2 years ago. We went at a non-rush time, 3:30pm. Service was ok ( I've worked the bar & restaurant business for 40 yrs, so I do know good, attentive service.). Our waiter was nice, but, he seemed distracted, we didn't get any silverware till we already received our food. My main reason for writing this is the food. It tasted good. My garlic cream fettuccine w/shrimp & mushrooms tasted good, but watery. My husband's bolognese was dry...not enought sauce. I asked for half salad but got a full one. After we left, I got tremendously ill. Stomach cramps and the feeling of throwing up. I'm also sensitive to too much salt, and I know restaurant food has more salt & fat then home cooking. I had wretched headaches all night long, and it made my temperature soar to 102*. I know you think maybe I got a cold but actually it's response to high salt...for me. I look up the nutritional value on line, my fettuccine had 1200 calories, and over 1100 grams of salt, then there's the cesaer salad. So today, the day after, I'm still having a few unhappy feelings. It would help if they had a low sodium menu or at least listed the nutritional values in the menu. i won't be eating here any more. If your salt sensitive, you may want to think twice. Mahalo for letting me vent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=140
Karen D.,"Puyallup, WA",839,365,1354,4.0,10/3/2011,"CPK. When it's good, it's really, really good, but when it's bad it's horrid. It's been a little like a ferris wheel in here, starting out at the bottom, soaring to the heights of redemption, only to slide back down to the bottom. As a new location, the experience was so terrible that I didn't return for a year. After that, things seemed to have improved. But alas, it didn't last, with the restaurant having recurring problems with the food (getting the order wrong) and service (inattentive and/or clueless). I've even been given dirty plates, so it's a little like an adventure--you never know what kind of experience you'll have.  Fortunately, things have been somewhat better lately, so I'm giving CPK four stars, at least this time around. The taste of the food has been what has kept me coming back despite the numerous hiccups in service. They offer honey whole wheat crust (yum!) and thin crust in addition to regular white crust. They also have a ""small cravings"" menu with appetizers and app-sized selections--a nice touch. In addition to the typical soft drink choices, they have Italian sodas and sugar-free Italian sodas, plus a full bar. CPK is a popular chain, so there is typically a wait at dinnertime, especially later in the week or on the weekend. Coming on Thursday night is just asking for trouble, since the adjacent farmer's market keeps this place hoppin' more than usual. Lanai seating is generally first available if you're willing to sit outside.  The Kailua CPK is in the heart of Kailua Town and is situated next to Pier One, next to Macy's, on the mauka side of Kailua Rd. Parking is not normally a problem, since there is a full-sized parking lot plus a two-story parking garage nearby (although these are shared). If you are carrying out your order, you can pull up in the driveway opposite the front door, and someone will meet you at your car. Hours are Mon-Fri, Sun 11:30am-9pm; Sat 11:30am-10pm.

Jessica B.,"Kailua, HI",0,3,,2.0,10/15/2016,"Honestly, when I first started eating at CPK this is the only location I've been to on the island. My BF always complained about the quality of food here and I now see why! I finally got the chance to eat at another CPK in Ala Moana shopping center and there was a huge difference in the quality of food we got there. Every time we at at the CPK in Kailua the food is horrible in comparison to other CPKs. We usually get the Thai chicken pizza and they always seem to mess it up here at the Kailua location, not enough sauce, burnt crust, pizza is cut unevenly, all the topping on one side or not enough toppings at all. The egg rolls here are always mushy too. The service is usually always great and they have a server named Mike who is amazing at customer service. The food expo guy and the back of the kitchen really need to get on track with how the food should be served.

Corinne E.,"Kailua, HI",73,68,160,2.0,9/14/2013,"Usually when you think of CPK, everyone has good thoughts and a favorite menu item or two.  Kailua CPK has really gone down the tubes.  Our waiter was nice and friendly but seemed like the kitchen kept messing up... well, he never did refill our water either.  The service here is just painfully slow... Lately everytime I go I am left feeling some how disappointed... and this last time was the last straw.  It's crazy how busy it always is but I think if they keep up what they are doing, slowly the people will leave as well...  The chips seemed stale... my friend ordered her Thai Crunch a special way with avocados. It came out wrong. Took so long for her correct order to come out and it seemed as if the avocados were so few... you had to hunt for them!  We all got a martini that stated in the menu they were $8.50 but were charged $9.25. When we pointed it out the waiter did apologize but then brings this laminated drink menu saying this is the Hawaii price and sorry but the hostesses have been told to not hand out the wrong menus.  He said the manager would not give us the price we saw.  While my friend's salad was comped after she realized she was even missing the peanuts... it's just not worth the money!  I would go to another CPK before I want to return to Kailua again... unless for some reason they return to how they used to be... so sad... Whoever is heading up Kailua CPK now...needs to really rethink what they are doing...  My experience isn't a stand alone one. Talking to a few others they have had bad service/food as well... so it's not just a one night fluke...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kailua?start=140
