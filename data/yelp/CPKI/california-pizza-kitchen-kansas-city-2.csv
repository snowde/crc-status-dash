Holly C.,"San Antonio, TX",7,19,1,2.0,4/28/2016,"Man. My breakfast sandwich looked redonk good as the customer in front of me ordered.  Disappointment. If was microwaved, and like all microwaved bread, it was chewy and hard just minutes after coming fresh out of the ""oven"" I gotta give it to em though - the sausage was DELICIOUS, and the flavor of the bread was wonderful too. This sandwich was huge, and would've been SO good had it been toasted in the oven instead. (The cheese got crusty and hard, and the bacon was nearly black lol)  4 stars if they didn't microwave it. Kinda sad you pay $8 for such poor quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city-2
Jessica W.,"Lenexa, KS",33,14,4,1.0,2/27/2017,I was very disappointed in a breakfast sandwich that I paid $9 for. I thought it would be worth the extra price but it was not high quality at all. The bacon was crumbled up tiny pieces and the bread was a microwaved chewy mess with no flavor. Go to Burger King right next to it and get a better sandwich for half the price.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city-2
Chris P.,"Indianapolis, IN",86,133,277,1.0,1/29/2016,Crapy precooked airport food. I do not like KC MCI anyway and all the good options are out of the TSA secured area. Best thing is to prepare to not eat laying over in MCI.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city-2
Jennifer J.,"Medford, MA",36,7,1,1.0,12/14/2016,"I don't know how this has the CPK name. This is a sad excuse for grab and go. Albacore Tuna Sandwich has maybe one scoop of tuna on each half, three slices of tomatoes and two large lettuce leaves with the hard center piece.  The tuna was dry and the bread was stale. Complete rip off for the cost.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city-2
Sierra ..,"Williamstown, MA",1,23,4,1.0,12/27/2015,"This miniature kiosk of a ""California Pizza Kitchen"" is a disgrace to the name of CPK. Once you decide between an ""authentic"" turkey sandwich, which is actually just lunch meat on store bought rolls, or a fresh salad, which is actually just old lettuce and gag worthy dressing, you'll pay an old woman half of your life savings.  If you want anything additional, like a beverage or chips, be prepared to give up what remains in your most likely empty pocket book. Calories that will fill you at best, and a little vomit on the carpet at worst, this establishment does not serve ""delicious"" food as cashier grammie will try to convince you. But what more would you expect from the worlds worst airport- void of human kindness and even the mere beginnings of an architectural sensibility.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city-2
Cindy D.,"San Diego, CA",42,317,1,3.0,7/20/2014,"With a $14 meal voucher in my hand (Southwest's way of saying ""sorry"" for leaving 6 of us behind when our delayed plane arrived 5 min late and booking us on a flight 4 hours later... I can't complain, they also gave me a $200 voucher), I went in search of some food at Kansas City International Airport.  The prices were pretty standard for airport food. I paid about $9.50 for a pre-made Cobb Salad. Some of the salad leaves were a little soggy and wilting, like they had been sitting for a while. The portion size filled me up and I didn't have to waste a bunch of salad. I feel bad when they give you waaaay too much salad you're never going to finish. Wasn't my favorite dinner of all time, but hey, they were cheap enough to bring me in under $14.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city-2
Brandon C.,"Reisterstown, MD",0,3,,5.0,4/11/2016,Hunt Valley Town Center was the best. The staff was aware that it was our first time there. They gave us a free appetizers and when my young daughter didn't agree with the taste of the food. They did not charge us and made our visit there the best.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city-2
Ashley C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,36,,1.0,9/13/2015,"Cannot believe CPK even puts their name on this disgrace. Clueless employees, inconsistent product, management nowhere to be seen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city-2
john j.,"Concord, CA",7,88,37,5.0,2/16/2015,Great food at a small airport. Able to get a few healthy options. The staff their was friendly and accommodating for myself and the kids. Special thanks to Derron and Pete for making the kids their special pizzas!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city-2
Jamie F.,"Frisco, TX",0,9,,1.0,9/22/2015,A $10 salad served by two people who have total apathy. The salad tasted like the whole thing had been a refrigerator for a couple of days. It was impossible to distinguish the flavor of chicken - so cold it hurt my teeth -from the other mushy ingredients. Gag.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city-2
Andy H.,"Kansas City, MO",70,41,7,2.0,1/18/2013,"I want to title this review ""What the heck happened to Sbarro?!?"" I fly out of the Kansas City Airport (MCI) 4 to 5 times a year between visiting family or traveling for work. They've made some awesome renovations this past year including a Starbucks after you pass through security but there is a renovation that's not awesome - California Pizza Kitchen. First off, when you have the option of Burger King or CPK, you will either hear a voice in your head saying ""CPK is so much more healthy"" or just be peer pressured into eating there because you don't want the 8 other people that you are traveling with to think that you aren't healthy (I'll leave it up to you, the reader, to figure out which of those scenarios happened to me). Some observations: 1. A small personal pizza was 10.00. If it was Sbarro, I could have gotten 2 slices of pizza for 7.00 that were bigger than the whole pizza at CPK. 2. Secondly, when you tell someone ""5 minutes for your pizza to be ready"" it should be ready in 5 minutes, not 15.  3. You should never act inconvenienced by customers who are basically paying your salary by purchasing food from your restaurant. Smile a little. When I fly again in 2 weeks, I'm totally going to Burger King.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city-2
Food Reviews T.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,10,1,1.0,1/1/2016,"This place was very expensive but I'd be more forgiving if the pizza was good. The sauce was bland, and the dough was horrible! There was no taste, it was only something to hold on too. It wasn't worth it, so I just went to the Burger King right beside it later in the day. Please don't go here, I hope they get there act up with the dough, but if not! DONT GO!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city-2
Parthiv P.,"San Diego, CA",2,23,,1.0,3/19/2015,Service sucks. Customer service practically doesn't exist. The way they made my pizzas was not upto CPK standards. Most veggies in one place.  It was like the employees did not want to be working there. Management you have a problem,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city-2
Randy B.,"Overland Park, KS",3,7,1,1.0,11/30/2014,Barf. Pizza was not even as good as Boboli that you could make at home. No oven spring typical airport overpriced crap food slapped together by bad attitude fast food worker. Save your money. .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city-2
