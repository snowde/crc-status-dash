Nayoun K.,"San Ramon, CA",268,149,92,2.0,6/9/2014,"Overpriced mediocrity. Management service seems like its trying to step it up but servers are missing the mark. Have gone in multiple occasions for mainly fundraisers, but latest occasion was just for dinner. Server started out as over zealous at first (came by every 45 seconds asking if we were ready when we informed him we were still waiting on a fourth member, then asked again as soon as they sat down without a chance to even open a menu) then brazenly loud about asking if everything was alright in a slightly scary way.  Trying something different from the usual piccatta I always get, I ordered the chicken tequila pasta and others got the turkey club and garlic fettuccine. Pasta was average at best, oily and no strong flavor other than the peppers and onions, with very little of the chicken protein mixed in. For about $17 a plate with tax and tip per person, totally not worth it.  Would not recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=120

Ok, it was already beginning to drop off a bit after our order was taken.  It seems almost every time I'm in SD for business I end up with others at a chain for lunch, but I must admit that I'm a fan of CPK's Sicilian thin crust pizza and their strawberry iced tea.  So I have no problem going along for the ride. But they had real trouble getting us refills (was there for over an hour and a half and got one), and everyone's order. I will give them credit for the fact that they tried to make it up to us by giving us a discount off the tab.  I think they knew that was a better route to go as opposed to comping us free dessert, because that would have resulted in more waiting time, and additional possible refill requests during the down time...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=120

Liz W.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,4.0,1/13/2016,"We eat here about once per month. They can be quite busy at dinner time, especially on the weekends. At times the wait can be quite long. You can call ahead and put your name on the list. This usually saves time. The food is consistent. My favorite is the Pear and Gorgonzola Pizza. Service is usually excellent, but can be inconsistent when they are busy. They sometimes have a deal where you can buy a discount ticket to the local AMC movie theater when you buy dinner.  Overall this is a great place but you need to be prepared to wait a long time for weekend dinners.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=120
Mai K.,"San Diego, CA",867,512,876,4.0,10/6/2012,"I've been here several times within this past year. They recently changed their menu and my favorite dish has been removed =(. So here's a review of their food past and present: Linguini with clams in a tomato basil sauce - This was my favorite dish, but they no longer serve it. It's light and savory and I'm a fan of clams too so that works out. Luckily, I had tried to mimic their dish at home and was pretty successful.  Jambalaya Fettuccine - It's good when it comes out, but after eating it for about 15 minutes, the fettuccine got cold and it got quite spicy. A bit too spicy for my taste and I probably won't be ordering it the next time. However, if you're a fan of spicy shrimp, this is the dish for you. Their dish has tons of shrimp.  California Cobb Salad - This is an awesome salad. Bacon, avocado, salad, chicken, boiled chopped eggs, tomatoes, cheese, and beets if you request it. I'm not a fan of salad, but all the other components of the salad made it really delicious to eat.  The Meat Cravers Pizza - NOM NOM NOM. If you're hungry for meat and pizza, get this one. Their Sicilian pizza is also good.  Bread and butter - they changed the bread they serve with their butter. I'm not sure, but I think it was a baguette that was originally sliced up so the bread was a harder texture. Now, their bread is pretty much sliced up sandwich bread so it's softer. They also don't give it to you if you don't request it so be aware.  Service - Their waiters and waitresses are very nice and I don't think I've ever gotten a rude one.  Their prices are fairly reasonable, so overall, I'll be coming back for more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=120
Amber B.,"San Diego, CA",1,67,10,3.0,6/22/2015,"First time ever to a California Pizza Kitchen (CPK). It's not the most amazing food but it satisfied my hunger so I can't complain. The spinach artichoke dip was okay, I've had better. It tasted like it was previously frozen. The margherita pizza was pretty good. I recommend adding extra sauce. Finally CPK has a rewards card that entitles you to one free small plate for your first use. I decided to go with the asparagus and arugula salad, which probably was the best part of my meal. I would definitely order the salad and pizza again but will skip on the dip for future visits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=120

The lady said that I called the wrong place even after I showed my phone with the right number. Yesterday I called 3 times to order a pizza!

I've tried the BBQ Chicken Pizza, Pear Gorgonzola, Peach Salad (forgot what it's actually called), California Club, Garlic Creme Pasta, and the Pesto Creme Penne. All were very good.

Ryann N.,"Escondido, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/22/2016,"I don't recommend coming here! There are a few other pizzas places extremely close, and another one opening. Stopped in yesterday, first our appetizer wasnt even hot, seemed to get an old order, the gentleman who brought it to us, literally threw the plate down, it landed right infront of my young daughter, and literally bounced off the spare plate that was sitting in front of her, that was just a small thing. Finally the server comes back about 10 min after eating the appetizer, to take our order, it had been so long I had honestly forgotten we hadn't even ordered lunch yet. Ordered a lunch special with out onions, came with onions, tried to pick them out, due to horror stories of sending food back, they were everywhere, I wasn't even done and the pizza was no longer hot and all over the place, the manager brought the food, and the server did not once in almost 10 min even look at our table, had to grab her attention. She immediately and quite noticeably became rude and irritated because I said that I did not want this and no I do not even want a new one (again horror stories). To the best of my knowledge I wasn't even rude, ive worked in the industry and for all I know she put no onions and the person who made the pizza still put them on. So it's not like I even blamed her, 5 minutes later while finally eating my salad, the manager came with a boxed up new pizza, saying ""he felt bad"" then took not only my salad, but my daughters pasta with out asking if we were done, which we had finally just started, boxed hers up, then came back and acknowledged my friend at least asking her if she finished, then brought us our bill, again with out asking if we were done. Pizza that I would never eat was on there,  but I didn't even dispute, because the way I was treated over simply not wanting something that was NOT what I ordered was ridiculous enough, and I felt due to their behavior already, that the managed and server would cause a scene in front of my child, paid just fine and even regretfully tipped 20%. So if you want pizza I would recommend walking a few feet to the other places near by, because you won't get what you ordered here, even the ""hot"" appetizers were cold, and you will be treated completely horrible over it.

The Jambalaya is not bad, with the variety of meat and seafood in it and a pretty decent sauce. I don't understand why they serve their bread cold though.

Two dishes arrived before the third, and the third arrived more than 30 minutes after the wait staff took the order. We were preparing to walk away in case the food did not arrive in time. The irony is that we told the waitress that we had a limited amount of time to eat, and she said she would tell the kitchen. Didn't help.

Truth be told, I'm not too crazy about much of the other items on the menu as they taste a bit processed and pre-made. Maybe it's because I've been eating here since high school? All that said, the salad is truly to die for.  Other than that, the manager of this place is wonderfully accommodating. He's always got a smile on his face and is very warm and attentive. Unfortunately, the serve staff leaves a lot to be desired. He had to make up for a few major blunders on their behalf but he did so gracefully and effectively.

Yuki M.,"Irvine, CA",40,1107,3954,3.0,9/6/2011,"Very easy parking and plenty of it. Nice shopping area with open air seating and a casual environment. One of the higher end strip malls. I'm not a fan of CPK, but this isn't to say that they aren't decent. The food is, for the most part, good, but I'd be foolish to expect anything stellar in terms of sit down fast food dressed up with deep booths and glass walls. As with all massive franchises, there is one thing I can always count on, regardless of establishment type or location - consistency. The food is predictable as is the quality and taste. The margherita piza was pleasant with an oddly chewy thin crust. I was expecting crisp but no matter. It was good. The sausage, pepperoni, and mushroom pizza on a regular crust was also good, though a bit heavy. The sausage was slightly spicy, a welcome surprise. Our server was very nice and professional. His attention to our table was impressive and though he was a bit slow in delivering our drinks and the change for the bill, he was worlds better than the slumped over waste of a human being standing at the host podium. What a pathetic employee. I'm sorry but if you really hate your job that much and don't care a lick to pretend for a second that you're grateful to be employeed, quit. I have never seen such an incomplete and utter absence of a man in any restaurant I've been to, and I've been to plenty and have never been afraid to voice my discontent (either here or to the management). Aside from the lump of soggy cheese put in charge of greeting every patron who walked through the door (stupid managerial choice there), the experience was as it always is at any CPK - predictable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=140

They accidentally left out some orders and food took a while to come out (as expected for a large group of people). They also didn't provide drinks/water until we had to keep asking the waiters for them. They also did not provide enough chairs as well.

It had been a few years since my last visit (food poisoning from a different location) but we had a gift card that needed to be used so we stopped by. The pizza is still as good as I remember it, and their jambalaya was tasty...but both were overpriced for what they were. We also weren't impressed by the service that day, as everything seemed to take extra long, and we could have been mistaken, but it seemed like the table next to us which sat down after us got served a lot sooner.

Jenny W.,"La Jolla, CA",27,228,33,3.0,8/17/2014,"Pricing: Good. Comparable to places like BJs and TGIF. Quality: Good-Excellent. The thin crust was surprising good! Turnaround: Good. Pretty fast for pizza! Service: Good. I am surprised that they did not offer to move us to a bigger table. Pizza is suppose to considered a cheap, but delicious food option for hungry poor college students so California Pizza Kitchen may be considered expensive to that group. However, comparing to other restaurants targeting the similar demographic groups of young working adults, the pricing is comparable. Not to mention, the thin crust pizza they had was surprisingly good. If they were not going crazy with the fusion toppings, I would almost compare the thin crust to a NY pizza. Although I did enjoy the fusion flavors, a traditional part of me did feel that the pizza did not quite hit the spot, but that is alright because the pizza was still delicious. The chipotle one was very spicy, especially when mixed with the salsa, and would be perfect for those who love spicy food. The turnaround was actually pretty fast considering that they were making pizza. I am use to waiting a while when I order pizza, but they actually came out in about the same time as a regular meal. Overall, the service was good and especially accommodating of us when I asked for more of the olive oil with herbs. They also had butter and balsamic vinegar so extra kudos for that! However, when the pizza came out, they ended up crowding our small table for two to the point where we could not even fit our plates.

We started off with the cold bread and butter, which felt as if it had just been pulled out of the refrigerator.  We were all hungry, but they never seem to bring enough for everybody.  When we tried to get more bread and water, our waiter was hardly ever seen, and when he was he barely seemed lucid. Ironically, I never order pizza when I dine here, despite having the word right in the name.  Instead I always opt for the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine pasta.  I can't actually taste any alcohol in the dish, which is probably for the better since I hate tequila.  The chicken was not as tender as I would have liked, but as a package, the dish was decently tight. Overall the dinner was a lot of fun, but the credit could only be given to the company.  The food was decent, but nothing mind-blowing, especially for the price.  Besides the fact that it is consistent and convenient, I'm not sure why people decide to spend their money here.  I've had the pizza before and was completely unimpressed, so that can't be it.  I guess it's sort of innovative and upscale, which I normally enough to pull the wool over most peoples' eyes, but it's not working on me.

Eventually we chose a table in the corner and were brought water and bread. The bread was tasty and came with herbed olive oil. We also requested balsamic vinegar to pair with the oil. They only brought out four pieces but are happy to bring more when you ask. I ordered, as always, the Thai Chicken Pizza. Along with the BBQ Chicken Pizza, it's my favorite thing at CPK. It's a very unique taste, topped with peanut sauce, bean sprouts, green onion and carrots and I always enjoy it. My friends both ordered BBQ Chicken Salads. But one of my friends had a very specific order. She asked for a lot of modifications and the waitress was happy to accommodate (i.e: switching out her cheese and tomatoes for walnuts and cranberries). But by mistake, she forgot to mention that she did not want the ranch dressing that the salad comes with. After receiving her food and noticing it was covered with ranch, she asked the waitress if it would be possible to replace the dressing on the salad, and they kindly brought her a new one.

About two minutes later the server came over and asked if we had any questions on the menu. So then we ordered are food. If you are craving soup I highly recommend the market vegetables soup. The soup comes with roasted squash and market vegetables with a touch of cream. For the pizza lovers the BBQ chicken pizza is a must. If you love spicy pizza then you have to try the Thai pizza. If you are coming here with kids you have a great kids menu. I love the new CPK menu that added a lot of new vegetarian items for the vegetarian eaters.  You also have gluten free pizzas. Leave room for deserts as you have some amazing cakes. If you are craving chocolate the Belgian Chocolate souffle cake is a must. Also the red velvet cake was excellent.

When I got the wedge, I noticed it had egg, I had not seen it on the menu when I ordered, because quite frankly I have ordered wedge salads all over the country for many years, NEVER had I seen it come with egg, I would notice because I hate eggs, I do not use the word hate lightly here, so I sent it back, to get one without egg. Well, our server I guess decided she would teach me a lesson, by waiting until my friend was almost done with her dinner and I with the mac & cheese, ( restaurant was almost empty, btw it was not good and dry) to get the new salad, when I asked about it, she said ""Next time you will tell me no egg when you order it!""  Excuse me!!! My parents are still alive, and they wouldn't speak to me like that. It was an honest mistake, I don't need my server to school me. When I finally did get it, it gave the name ""iceberg lettuce"" a new meaning, the lettuce was so cold, that it actually hurt my teeth to eat, so I didn't, I had her box it up so I could take it home, later I decided to just throw it away.

I was lil taken aback since I remember clearly that i made a reservation at 7pm. THese sort of confusions do happen, atleast have the courtesy to say "" Sorry looks like there was a confusion , let me try to find a table earlier than 730"". I have no idea how she can be so confident about remembering my call out of the numerous reservation requests they get each day. I did not want to argue with her. I requested her to find a table earlier than 730 since there were lil kids in the group. She said she can seat us in 10 mins. We just kept waiting and waiting. Went and checked the status at 730 (which she said was my reservation time), again she said 5 more minutes. Her attitude as absolutely horrible. Not the attitude you should have to work in the front desk.  Then it was 745 and by this time at least 6 other similar sized groups including some who just walked in after us had gotten tables. And there were so many tables empty. They just said they don't have enough waiters to serve the tables (note this is Saturday night, their peak business hour ). We requested to talk to the manager, and all this while this lady had the most rude attitude and was getting into our head. The manager was polite, he had the usual customer care tone.

Everyone was arriving separately, so it took about 30 minutes or so before most of the group had arrived. But our table was waiting and our server, Erick, was attentive, friendly, and had a great sense of humor.  When asked if he could get us anything, I responded with, ""Yep, a free round of drinks."" He quipped, ""Sure! I'll bring waters all around."" I love me a good pizza, but CPK isn't the place where I go for my pie. And although I'm a carb girl, I skipped the pasta and choose the Caesar Salad with chicken.  The full portion was more than enough for two, but I wasn't sharing. This girl was hungry. The chicken was perfectly grilled, a nice crisp to the skin without being dry. A few misses: It took a long time to get our food. Service slowed a bit as the restaurant got busier. We had to flag him down to get refills on our water, drinks, etc. But our group was big and the restaurant had gotten busier. Major plus and what kicked this to a 4-star review: Separate checks.

Brett M.,"Long Beach, CA",0,99,36,4.0,7/16/2016,California vegetarian pizza was outstanding.    Bartender suggested wheat crust which I did and enjoyed immensely.    My only issue was my bill came to $15.11.   And I gave the bartender a $20.00 bill and got $4.11 back.  Somehow the math doesn't add up there.  I tried to wait to have it fixed but she was busy and I had to get to a soccer game.   The bill miscalculation will not stop me from going to a CPK but I would appreciate getting the right change back.

Jessica S.,"San Diego, CA",235,920,2051,3.0,6/27/2015,"The food is decent, and our waitress that day was friendly, but not exactly quick, and the kitchen was unbelievably slow. My husband surprised me by coming to visit me for lunch one day, and we ended up at CPK. I had just had CPK cater a large event a week before, and was interested in trying their food items fresh, instead of after everything had been pawed at by my group, and after it had sat out for a while. The restaurant wasn't packed. There were a fair number of people dining that day, but we were shown to a (slightly grimy) table right away. Our waitress showed up almost immediately, and got our drinks to us quickly. And then, it kind of fell apart. I had asked for a bit more time when she delivered the drinks, as I was still trying to peruse the menu and make a decision. She said it was no problem, but then she disappeared for about ten minutes. When she finally came back, I ordered the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine and my husband ordered the Habanero Carnitas pizza. And then the wait began in earnest. People were milling about the kitchen (we were seated right outside of it), waiting for meals to be plated, garnished, or otherwise made ready to go. There were a lot of people in the serving space, but it seemed like there were only two or three people actually making the food. We ended up waiting over 25 minutes for our meals to be brought out, and our waitress never once stopped by to let us know the progress, or to apologize for the wait. My husband did love his pizza. I mean, he LOVED it. He devoured the entire thing in record time, and kept saying how good the meat was, how perfect the crust was, and how spicy the sauce was. Bollocks for him. My food was meh. It wasn't terrible by any means, but it also didn't blow me away. For that wait - and for the price - I wanted to be knocked on my keister. The pasta was a bit sticky, so it was hard to twirl onto a fork to eat. The chicken was a overcooked, so I didn't eat much of it. And the dish itself was overloaded with bell peppers.  I ate what I could, but there was a fair amount of partially-cooked bell peppers and over-cooked chicken pieces left behind. Not exactly what my ideal lunch outing, but at least my husband enjoyed his meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=40

I felt  so frustrated. She didn't even apologized to me. Like I was not important because there was a big party right behind me.  The worst part comes now, I went to find the manager of the restaurant and told her the situation and she not only was mean to me, but she defended her employee and said the same excuse, that she was helping a big party.

Mel J.,"San Diego, CA",465,630,4392,3.0,10/20/2014,"CPK is famous for cozy booths, cheery servers, and a creative menu with many fusion flavors. Plus they guarantee...try a new pizza, and if you hate it, send it back and they really do replace it with another one of your choice for free! Weeeee! Below are tips from my last few visits:    --It's scorching hot outside. Great day for the Moroccan-Spiced Chicken Salad at CPK, with roasted butternut squash, dates, avocado, toasted almonds, red peppers, egg and cranberries, with a champagne vinaigrette. It's refreshing, with interesting spices, just enough to taste but not so spiced that it dominates the salad. 1/2 size is still large.  --The sesame ginger dumplings for $8.39 are light and always fun to share. The soy-ginger chili sauce is nice, a little sweet and gently spiced. I'm glad these aren't deep fried...less fat.  --Trying the thin crust Margherita pizza for $13.29, with tomato, mozzarella, fresh basil, shaved Parmesan, and I added oregano. I should have chosen a more adventurous pizza. This is ok, but the crust isn't as good as a Margherita at an artisan or true Italian ristorante.  --Tricolore salad pizza is no linger on the menu, but the kitchen can still make a similar version.  --Salads are fresher than the ones at Tender Greens in UTC. Next time I'll try the Spicy Chipotle Chicken pizza, as CPK is best at the adventurous pizzas. I enjoy being pampered by the cheery, helpful servers, so I'll be back on occasion when I want to sit in a cozy booth and suck down decent iced tea with my pizza.

It was SO aromatic and flavorful.  - we got the BBQ chicken salad and added salmon to share. It was delicious. The salmon was individually cut up and cooked so it was on the dry side, and the salad was a little underdressed, but I didn't mind it because I just poured lime juice all over and all was good in the world again.   - the thai chicken pizza is a little different than what i'm used to. The sprouts, carrots, and chives were added atop the pizza after it was cooked, so they were still fresh instead of melted into the pizza cheese. Nevertheless, it was DELICIOUS.

He was awesome.  Very quick, friendly, and attentive.  You can't ask for more.   They served a warm sour dough bread with olive oil before the pizza.  It had to just come out of the oven.  It was soft with just a slight sour dough taste.  I ordered the mushroom, sausage, pepperoni.  I always order pasta and was in a pizza mood. I'm so glad I did.  It was amazing.  delicious.  The sauce was perfect.  The cheese was light; I couldn't really taste it or see it with all the toppings.  The crust was thin throughout and built up thick on the ends.  It was a great pizza overall. The toppings made it.  The mushrooms were small and sliced extremely thin. The sausage was larger round balls and the pepperoni was larger and sliced extremely thin.  I think it was the perfect combo.  They were all fresh and plenty!   We ordered 1 pizza and it was the perfect size to share.  It was 6 slices that I thought were average slices.   We had a tasteful lunch with great service!

We all decided to begin with the full-sized Caramelized Peach Salad w/ Applewood Bacon (~$11). Composed of spinach, field greens, cranberries, warm peaches, red onions and Gorgonzola, I thought that it was extremely flavorful and made for an ideal starter. One of my dining companions commented that the peaches didn't taste caramelized, but, rather, they tasted as if they were dumped right out of a can. I was unable to detect any canny-like flavors, but I was slightly disappointed that there wasn't more of a caramel taste to the peaches.  I departed from the rest of the pack and decided to have a sandwich from the menu, in lieu of pizza. The California Club ($11.50) seemed to be bellowing out my name and I couldn't resist. What a surprisingly tasty sandwich! Served on herb onion bread, the sandwich consisted of turkey, Applewood bacon, avocado, lettuce and tomato. Executed really well. Impressive sandwich that I would certainly order again. Pizzas made an appearance for the other two hungry tummies at the table: The Works (Italian sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, mozzarella, onions, green peppers and olives), and the Jamaican Jerk ( Jerk chicken, spicy/sweet Caribbean sauce,  bacon, bell peppers and scallions). Each pizza is approximately 10"" in size, providing about 6 small slices. I don't believe there were any leftovers. Each pizza averaged around $13 each. A little expensive, in my opinion, especially given the size.   I did find it unusual that CPK didn't have nutritional data on their menu like other chains typically provide. It's probably a good thing, though. While my two tablemates were engaged in conversation, I Googled the caloric value of The Works and found that each smal slice was 238 calories (1,428 calories for the entire pizza). My dining companion would have died had he known he consumed upwards of 2,000 calories last night (pizza, salad and cocktail combined). Poor baby. So, if you're watching your diet, having pizza at CPK is likely not going to help you in that department.  Our service lagged a bit. I noticed that another couple at a table were struggling to be noticed by the waitress on several occasions. Notwithstanding, our waitress was sweet and patient with us while we decided on what to order. Overall, a little overpriced, but still decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=80
G G.,"San Diego, CA",0,13,1,1.0,7/3/2016,"I would put zero if I had the option. I went there with my wife. Right after we stepped into the main door a big group of 8+ people came in. The restaurant receptionist went straight to the big group and asked how many they were and instantly left and started to prepare space for them. After 15 minutes she came back ready to take them to the table and my wife asked her if she was going to find us a seat since we were there first. She seemed surprised and slightly apologized but she did not do anything about it, however she said literally this ""you guys can seat whatever you want"" Ok then, we went ahead and found a table. The big group was right next to our table. We were expecting her to start serving us first. Well, she started serving the big group and no one came for us. I stepped up and went straight to the manager and explain what happened. The manager instead of trying to keep things calm, started to find excuses and explain what was unexplainable. At the same time she was laughing like she was not a serious person who is able to handle situations like this. When I saw her behavior I definitely decided to leave the place immediately and never come back. If they have something to say about it, go ahead and reply!

This last time we decided to do the order to pick up. We ordered a few appetizers, a couple meals and a drink. They told us to come by at 6:18pm, our food will be ready. That was about 20 minutes from the call. By boyfriend heads over and is there by 6:25pm. They don't have our order ready so he's asked to wait an additional 30 minutes, while they nicely tell us it's almost ready. By 40 minutes my boyfriend asks how the order is and they tell him there is a hold up because they are 'looking for a bag' to put it in. 10 more minutes and my boyfriend has had enough and asks to see the manager. I understand that dinner hours and busy and orders out are sometimes left last minute. However, this establishment should have accounted for that when telling us our pick up time.  Furthermore, blaming what we ordered to be the issue, that our appetizer takes a long time to prepare? Why make us feel bad for ordering a time consuming appetizer? Just adjust our wait time or better yet, mention it over the phone when we order!

I also tried the spicy chipotle chicken original hand tossed crust and the roasted corn black bean salsa and lime crema make this dish. The thin crust pizzas are larger.  It's so refreshing to have these bright fresh flavors on a hearth cooked pizza. They also give you the free bread you get when dining in and the seasoned dipping olive oil with your takeout. Yum.  People complain a lot about the temperature of the food when delivered or upon takeout SMH at idiots that can't read. The pizza box has easy to understand directions about being patient enough to follow the reheating instructions.  The pizza is fresh and some are thin crust so durr it's going to cool off quickly.

Friend wanted to eat at CPK on weekend for lunch since we were both in the area. There was plenty of parking spaces that later afternoon in this strip mall they share with AMC theater and DSW Shoes.  The nice hostess sat us in the back where there were more booths. It felt a bit muggy in the entire restaurant for some reason. Not sure if it's from the kitchen or perhaps they can increase the a/c to a more comfortable level.  There's complimentary bread that comes with a side of olive oil and vinegar.  Sorry for the yellowish pics but the back had yellow awnings covering the patio and windows. We ordered: SESAME GINGER CHICKEN DUMPLINGS: - don't expect these dumplings to be of ""Convoy street"" quality. BUT, these dumplings weren't bad. The filling was flavorful and well seasoned. We liked the fresh green scallions that topped the dumplings.  CRISPY MAC 'N' CHEESE: - deep fried mac n cheese. Friend ordered this and ate only two before he pushed the plate away. He commented to the waiter that something tasted off about the mac n cheese but waiter said that he personally liked the dish.  THAI CRUNCH salad: - I really liked the use of fresh raw napa cabbage in this salad. It was just perfect. The Thai peanut dressing wasn't too heavy. The strips of chicken were pretty dry and I thought there was a tad too much edamame in the salad. You can also add avo for $2 or so more.  PESTO CREAM PENNE with chicken : - this was a nicely creamy pasta dish but could have used more chunks of chicken. The sun dried tomato was a nice tart contrast to the savory parmasan in this dish. Service was fine. Not sure I'd be back anytime soon but might try out another salad .

I also tried it and it was really inedible.  We highlighted to the manager and they apologized profusely and immediately put a new steak on the grill. When the bill came they comped the steak (without us asking).  We take customers out to eat all the time including Qualcomm.

They had tons of variety in their menu, but I opted for a simple spaghetti w/ marinara meat sauce, and Me & my friends split a pizza, half bbq for her, and half hawaiin for me. The spaghetti was not fully boiled, so the noodles were not the slimy cooked texture i like, the meat sauce was dry and bland, and they hardly put any marinara sauce, which I was upset about.  Their saving grace was their bread & olive oil dip.  Their service was great though, can't lie. Extremely friendly servers, and food came out pretty quick.

I have never eaten at a California pizza kitchen, I've only ever had their frozen pizza. I was really excited to go in and try their other food. When you walk in, you're greeted by nice hostesses and the restaurant looks very clean. We got seated at a table for 4 and it took a bit longer than normal for our server to come over and take our drink order. We order drinks and an appetizer. After about 3 minutes a table behind us gets seated and they now have their drinks. We are STILL waiting on our drinks. They FINALLY arrive and we are then waiting again for our app. It comes out probably 15 minutes after we place the order. So now we have finished with our appetizer and our drinks are empty. He still doesn't come over. Another 20 minutes and we finally have our dinner. I had to ask the girl who brought our dinner out to refill our drinks. She doesn't even remove the empty glasses. He comes over AFTER we have been taken care of and tells us to ""holler"" if we need anything. Excuse me? Am I in a barn? So we finish our food and order dessert. Ughhhhhhhh it was terrible just like the food. Strawberrry shortcake..more like strawberry biscuit. Sooooo dry!

My mom called the server over right away and to let him know and he called the manager over. After we explained what had happened, we simply wanted to ensure their kitchen/Ingredients were checked so this did not happen to anyone else. However, the manager went above and beyond and remade the pizza for my aunt and gave us a gift card, he also offered free dessert (which we kindly declined).

Arabelle B.,"Winchester, CA",4,33,26,3.0,12/3/2016,"Food was great. Service was average. Our server's name was Allison.  When we asked her if one pizza would be enough to share between two people, she answered that it's usually just for one individual and pretty small.  We then asked the same about their pastas, thinking that there must be SOMETHING we could share. She answered again by saying the pastas are usually small as well and good for one person. Taking her advice, we ordered two pastas that, in the end, we COULD NOT FINISH-- And my boyfriend and I are pretty big eaters by the way (This is only good for those of you who like huge servings that could feed two people).  I feel that it was just a sales technique so that we would spend more money. Which is unfortunate, because I believe a server should be honest and accommodating to all of their customers no matter how much they are purchasing.  Also, I like being able to sit and talk while enjoying my meal at my own pace. However, I just felt like my boyfriend and I were rushed.

Melissa P.,"Seattle, WA",575,132,113,4.0,7/24/2016,"I have never really been a huge fan of CPK but their Spicy Chipotle Chicken pizza changed that for me! I can't even explain how delicious it is! It is Chipotle adobo sauce, shaved poblanos and Monterey Jack with housemade roasted corn & black bean salsa, fresh cilantro and tangy lime crema. It is a little more than enough for one person but not enough for two hungry people.  I had a really good experience at this location, with a really friendly waitress! She saw that we were starving and eager for the pizza to come out so she brought us out complimentary bread and sauce with it! I am not sure if complimentary bread comes with your dish no matter what, but it was still nice that she was understanding and accommodating! She brought us out a second plate of bread because we scarfed down the first one! Overall, I am not sure why people seem to rate CPK on the lower end. If it is food related, try the chipotle chicken and maybe that will change your opinion of this place! Granted, it is around $13.50 which is definitely on the more expensive side for a personal pizza but its well worth it once you get a taste of it.

I wouldn't have minded sitting there if it hadn't been where every waiter decided to stand and complain about how slow the restaurant was. It was horribly distracting while eating and very unprofessional. We split the classic BBQ pizza. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time, but it was bland and the seasonings on the table didn't really improve the flavor much.

The waiter attend us in 20 minutes, takes order of drinks and disappears, in 15 minutes he comes back with drinks and take order for the food, my daughter was very hungry and of course it was for so long more to get our food. The food was ok, the stake though,  had a lot of fat parts, much more then the meat. I ordered three more steaks to take home. The waiter brought those and I didn't check. I should have.  At home I discovered No greens that coming with all three steaks, no bread, no napkins.  Next, they were supposed to take 15 dollars off the bill from my pizza reward card, instead they counted 12$ more to the actual bill.  My order was over hundred $ and usually I tip well.

Abby W.,"San Diego, CA",1489,972,759,3.0,9/18/2016,"I took a couple kids that I was babysitting to dinner at CPK at their request. I've been to other locations in the past and have never been blown away by their food. Despite having pizza in the name, which implies that that is their specialty, their pizzas have always failed to impress me. Combine that with just finishing up at the movie theater with popcorn and a soda and I was craving something healthier. I chose the Cobb salad with no bacon and subbed the bleu cheese for cheddar. I'm aware that this likely no longer makes it a true Cobb salad but it almost perfectly fit my idea of the perfect salad. I love grilled chicken, tomatoes, and eggs on my salad and the only other ingredient that I would have liked would be black olives, which I probably could have requested but forgot. The salad also is topped with avocado, which was new for me as I only recently discovered that I like avocado. The mushy texture is still a little weird for me on a salad and I could do without it but I understand why some people like it, I guess. The ranch here is a little odd but not as bad as places that serve dressing like Hidden Valley. I'm very particular about my ranch dressing and this one had a strong flavor that I'm thinking has to do with the herbs they use in the housemade dressing.  The kids each ordered their own cheese pizzas, which seemed a bit excessive to me, but they're 11 and 12 year old boys and they easily finished the pizza and downed a kids portion of mac and cheese too. Growing boys, what else can I say! My biggest complaint of the night has nothing to do with the food but with the initial greeting. We were told the wait would be 15 minutes but it ended up being 30 minutes. When there's two hungry boys waiting for food, the extra 15 minute felt like an eternity. Had we known the wait would take that long, we would have moved on to another restaurant.

Usually when a restaurant says something is spicy it's really not, but that pink habanero sauce is the real deal--and delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=240
Frances L.,"South San Francisco, CA",2,33,1,2.0,2/26/2012,"I've been a long-time customer of CPK. I had my prom dinner here when I was a teen, it's been a great place for hangouts, family dinners, and even birthday parties. But lately, CPK has been disappointing my family with their to-go service, which we are usually a huge customer of. My mother experienced a ""wrong order"" incident at the Fashion Valley location aka they gave her pastas instead of the pizzas she asked for. My mother wanted a tomato basil pizza and was told later that ""No, we don't have tomato basil pizza so I assumed you meant the pasta. BUT, we do have a margherita pizza."" The server even went as far as to blame my mother for not specifically saying ""margherita pizza."" So, instead of clarifying the order like this server should have, she assumed what my mother wanted instead? And then telling her that they had a margherita pizza and not the tomato basil, which, by the way, has practically the exact same ingredients? My mom was appalled.  So my mother, deciding to give CPK another go (bless her heart), went to their location on Nobel Drive instead, thinking that she would avoid the same trouble she had at their Fashion Valley location. Unfortunately, another ""wrong order"" incident happened again at the to-go station. My mother repeatedly said ""no sausage"" on one of the pizza orders and when she went home, she was incredibly disappointed to discover that there were sausages on the pizza. She said to me, ""I just don't understand. After repeatedly telling them exactly what I wanted, how could this have happened?!"" It's been incredibly disappointing and sadly, my mother no longer wants to come to this establishment due to their repeated inability to get the right order. I don't necessarily blame the individual who took the order, but I have an issue with management. They need to provide proper training about doing a ""read back"" on their orders to confirm that they're putting in the right orders for their customer. It is a simple check that can avoid customer service disasters. It's a common thing they do in hospitals (and at other establishments) that help to avoid critical medical errors. If you simply ""assume"" what a doctor's order meant without clarifying or didn't look over something twice because you simply decided it was just too much effort, you could do irreparable damage. Doing a read-back is a simple fix. If management reads this, please bring this up at your next meeting or institute this simple training when teaching your servers valuable customer service. My mother, a restaurant owner herself, understands mistakes that servers make and she is absolutely forgiving. But the sheer lack of respect for customer service has left her and the rest of our family, reeling.  That being said, if that doesn't change up, I would not use their to-go service. And if you do, clarify the order yourself. Otherwise, you just might end up with pasta instead of the pizza you asked for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=240

James F.,"San Diego, CA",359,585,566,4.0,9/6/2009,"We joined some friends for CPK on Friday night, and enjoyed CPK's non-pizza offerings. I had their Grilled Dijon Chicken Fococcia Sandwich, which was pretty good - it was nice and mustardy. A side of Sedona Tortilla soup rounded out my meal. For a chickenless tortilla soup, it's quite good. It reminded me of my favorite Tortilla Soup from Scott's Deli downtown. My wife had the Pesto Cream Penne, which she enjoyed and took some home as a leftover.  One cool thing was their ability to automatically generate split checks for credit cards - no trying to figure out how much your share of the bill is! We sat on the side patio, after deciding the back patio was a little too sunny for us and our friends' two boys, who were rather squirmy. Service was good - paying good attention to us and keeping our drinks topped off despite being the only table occupied in the side patio - i think our server liked watching the kids play around. My raspberry lemonade was a little odd - it was raspberry syrup at the bottom of a glass of lemonade, and didn't actually mix well. But a cool drink on a hot evening hits the spot regardless.

I ordered the new pasta that was on the menu called the Baby Clam Linguini with Lemon Cream Sauce instead of the Italian Tomatoe sauce with fresh basil. My boyfriend ordered the Portobello Mushroom Ravioli. Food took awhile to come out so I expected something sort of amazing but when our food did come out, I was not amazed. The portions were small, tiny as a matter of fact. Maybe the amount that they serve is perfect for people who eat as much as they serve, but for me, I eat A LOT and it takes quite a big portion of food to fill me up. While both the meals were good, it wasn't spectacular. I've had better and I thought that for the price, they could have served more... I was also hoping to get the CPK ""Don't Open It"" Thank You Card but when I talked to the manager, he had said that they had passed all of it out and no longer have any available. The CPK Thank You Cards promotion end July 3rd so I thought they could have gotten more or something since it is only early June.

Roslyn B.,"San Diego, CA",0,15,,1.0,2/6/2013,"Words cannot describe how utterly horrific it is to make a togo order from this place. They have some train wreck of a call center in Colorado that takes your order, then sends it to your specific location. That is, if you can understand to which location they are referring and if your order will ever make it to the one that you ""called"". The operators call Solana Beach by the name of the shopping center (did anyone know that center even had a name??) and pronounce La Jolla ""luh jawla"". And that's honestly just irritating; the truly bad part is that they ALWAYS MESS UP YOUR ORDER: I ask to substitute shrimp, I end up with chicken still tossed into my salad and a side of hot shrimp. I ask for bread, nope, no bread. When every single person insists dressing comes one the side, the one time I finally stop requesting dressing on the side, my salad comes drenched. The other part of the call center that drives me insane is how many times the call has cut out in the middle of ordering. You then have to call back, hope you remember the person's name, and try to confirm that your order made it to the restaurant and wasn't lost somewhere over the rockies. Then, to top it all off, they try to upsell you some ""delicious slice of key lime pie"" or an ""iced cold beverage' its like no, thanks, if I wanted that I'd order it, please just listen to what I DO want and maybe you'll get it right for once. Either every single person in that call center has had a lobotomy or is enjoying Colorado's newly passed marijuana laws a little too much because I have yet to come across one who is competent. Bottom line: wish I could count how many times I've just gone home to eat frozen deli-mex taquitos from 1998 over having to deal with CPK's togo issues.

Josephine C.,"San Marcos, CA",1,61,,3.0,1/4/2015,"Feb 13, 2015 Okay, here's an update to my original review: we went on a Friday night after SeaWorld because it was on the way home.  My daughter ordered the children's pasta with marinara sauce but received pasta with butter (but that could have been her own fault since she's very soft spoken...).  I ordered the artichoke/spinach flat bread pizza with chicken - chicken was dry and they put one lousy strip of chicken on each slice of pizza-6 slices, total.  also wish the waiter had mentioned how much bigger this pizza would be compared to their regular crust pizza-big enough to share with two people.  In that case, I would have ordered one fewer item and shared with another family member...husband ordered thai chicken pizza and said they ruined the pizza by putting too many bean sprouts and oh too many carrots!!! and not enough actual thai pizza taste...we'll return to this CPK because we generally like their service and food but we certainly won't be ordering the chicken with my artichoke/spinach flat bread pizza again or the thai chicken pizza (unless we ask them to ease up on the toppings of bean sprouts and carrots).   Jan 4, 2015 We visited this CPK location after the San Diego Int'l Auto Show today because my husband loves their Carmelized Peach Salad.  The restaurant was not that crowded since it was about 3pm. Everything was fine until we sat and waited for our meals.  After about 15 minutes, the kids' meals came out and we were told our (adults) food would be out shortly.  All the while, I noticed on the kitchen counter, sat my Grilled Veggie Sandwich that I ordered.  In fact, my order sat another 10 minutes on the counter while they still prepared my husband's Carmelized Peach Salad.  Waiting another 10 minutes does NOT constitute ""your food will be out shortly.""  My husband, who frequents this location much more than I do, said he thought something was off because he saw others waiting a long time for their food and it's usually much quicker.""  Perhaps they have a new cook or was short staffed, or something... At any rate, I was NOT impressed with how slow our food came out after our children's food was delivered but I'll give them another chance because I thought their Grilled Veggie Sandwich and the Mediterranean salad was delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=200
Roland F.,"Rancho Santa Fe, CA",1044,132,,2.0,11/29/2010,"I'm not sure how this place manages to make it. There are so many better choices for pizza and pasta in San Diego. The food is average, the pasta is mass market American style, the pizza likewise and service so-so. If every other place in the UTC area is closed, and there is no other option, then we come here. That has happened about 6 times and each time I go I expect that it will be better, but it never is. There's nothing wrong with this place. The food is okay, the service is okay, the atmosphere is okay. It's just that you can do so much better for the same price. If you like chain restaurant food and you think places like the Olive Garden, Chili's and Rock Bottom are great, then you'll probably like it. On the other hand, if you're more into the quality of food and dining experience, try some of the more unique, non-chain options in the area. In the area, I'd opt for Island's (just across the driveway in the same shopping center), Ginza Sushi (in the mall in the same shopping center by the theater), Nordstrom Cafe (at UTC mall for quick sandwich) or Red Robin (also in UTC mall). These are similar types of place with much better food and service for the dollars spent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=200

I don't really understand this but I guess it's ok once you have your olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Pizza: I tried the Chipotle chicken pizza and the Cobb pizza.  Chipotle chicken- it said that it was going to be hot and spicy. It was pretty medium tasting. It come with chicken and a chipotle sauce, all topped with a corn and black bean salsa. Price around $13.00. I do enjoy the crust at CPK. It's not oily and just your simple crust.  California Club: it comes with bacon, chicken then topped with lettuce and avocado. You think you are getting a ""healthy pizza."" It's a whooping 1560 calories along with 3500 grams of sodium. I'm glad I only had 2 pieces of this. The lettuce is pretty coated in the ranch dressing. Also around $13.00 Service: Our server was decent. She refilled our waters, but was slow on getting the marinara sauce we asked for.  We had one of those ""Don't open it until you get to CPK"" coupons. We only had 10% off and when I went home to open up the rest of them, they were all 10% off.  Come back again?

They're filled with chicken, beans, corn and come with 2 delicious dipping sauces. The tortilla soup is also delicious...creamy and tomatoey.  If you're into salads but are scared that they won't fill you up, leave those worries behind. The cobb salad and the original chopped are my favs. They are HUGE! My favorite pizza to get here is the Jamaican Jerk. Love the bacon bits, slightly sweet and slightly spicy sauce, the bell peppers, YUM! I can never finish a whole pizza and am always satisfied with how this pizza tastes the next day.  Service here is always friendly and helpful. It's  not always the fastest  so don't expect a fast meal when you come here. However,  I do love that you can try a new pizza and if you don't like it,  just ask for your usual and exchange it out. Take out is also very convenient...you can order online and they bring the food right out to your car.

The salad was extremely enjoyable because I did not expect a simple field greens salad to have pieces of juicy anjou pears and caramelized walnuts in it! The combination just hit the spot and made a great appetizer :-) I would definitely recommend getting the vegetarian and Japanese eggplant pizza on a whole wheat crust. It gives it an extra crunch and saves you like 10 calories per slice! The pizza was a bit dry, but the variety of veggies made up for the lack of sauce on the pizza.  Overall, I had a pretty enjoyable experience and the food wasn't half bad. The service was great and the pricing was about average for a restaurant like this.

I would only go here because it's near the UCSD campus.  My family ordered the new dynamite shrimp appetizer because the waitress recommended it. We also ordered the jamaican jerk chicken pizza, jambalaya, and the baja fish tacos. The dynamite shrimp was okay. it tasted like panda expresses' honey walnut shrimp, but more expensive. There wasn't a kick of flavor, and it was less crispy/softer than I thought. The white noodles they add to the dish made it more crispy, I guess. The jamaican jerk chicken is basically chicken with veggies, and barbecue sauce. It was very delicious though. The always enjoy CPK's pizzas because even though it's not called thin crust, the crust is still bite size, and it's good. I can tell the bread is fresh. The jambalaya is always my favorite pasta. It has this spicy, smoky taste added with sausage, and chicken. i like it because it has a lot of flavor, and the portions are good for sharing. The baja fish tacos were good, but you can get them at rubio's for cheaper. The fried fish was crunchy, and easy to bite into. The sauce was basically salsa, and when you add it onto the taco, it was very savory, and full of flavor. However, you can taste the same ones for 99 cents.  The service was so bad. We asked for bread and butter, but the waitress forgot, so we had to ask a second time before she finally brought it to our table. This took 20 minutes. She barely refilled our waters, so we had to ask for it. One thing I liked was that the manager came around to ask if everything was okay.

Dean D.,"Glendale, AZ",118,100,,3.0,6/7/2012,"Being the foodie fanatic that I am, it's so easy for me to write off American chain restaurants as the scum of culinary culture or as a sacrilege that insults culinary history. In some ways, it does. But in other ways, it also represents the course of history that cuisine in general has taken. After all, in a nation that continually grows more and more industrialized with cities that must house hundreds of thousands of people, these chains become a necessary evil that ensures that everyone can be fed. If everybody in America lived strictly on locally grown ingredients, we'd run out of money and then run out of options for eating. It's a terrible and most inconvenient truth but it's one we must accept for now... Where am I going with this? Ah yes, I was kind of scoffing at the notion of a chain restaurant. But I feel that CPK is a chain that warrants legitimate analysis and investigation. So here's my take on the matter. CPK's menu is actually rather diverse and offers a great variety of different specialty pizzas to try. Their pizzas are very colorful and come served on a rather thin crust and topped with many different combinations of ingredients, some of which work wonderfully well whilst others work wickedly wrong. But I guess what I'm trying to say is that they experience and try things, often offering new limited-time items on their menu every year. And the pizzas themselves can be quite pretty. Simple yet elegant and delicate. Consistently light thin crusts serving as a canvas for a rainbow of toppings. Very ""Nouvellian"" in design, perhaps? And the key word here is ""California."" In no way is CPK's pizza representative of classic Italian cuisine. Instead, it embraces California cuisine very well, which emphasizes fusion, experimentation, and the use of locally grown fresh ingredients (well in this case, that last part doesn't apply). But for the most part, their menu reflects that sort of ""mission statement"" rather well. So here we go. Onto the food. My favorite pizzas here are the bbq chicken and the shrimp scampi. The shrimp scampi pizza in particular has bold garlic flavor, which I always appreciate. And the bbq chicken is a classic favorite of mine that CPK does rather well. It's got a good layer of sauce underlying the cheese that complements the thin pizza dough but there's also a crunch quality in the red onions that top it that gives it that little extra yum factor. Once upon a time, they had a buffalo wings pizza on their menu that was bold enough to have chicken wings, wing sauce, and lettuce on it. But whoever thought lettuce on a pizza was a good idea was a madman. Lettuce has no place on a pizza for it adds nothing but an awkward crisp texture with zero flavor on a pizza slice that should be savory and sweet. But the fact that they tried something so outrageous is what makes CPK stand out from the rest of the generic pizza chains out there. Forgive the rather lengthy review. I tire of writing so I'll wrap this up quickly. CPK has consistent good food albeit somewhat pricy. But it's there for you should you ever crave it. And CPK sometimes does unexpected things that no other pizza chain would dare and it deserves high praise at least for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=180

We added our name to the four page list and checked our phones. We had 25 minutes before we would be seated... This was acceptable, it being a Friday night. We walked to Ross on the other end of the shopping center. After we browsed through the cheap clothing, I purchased 'The Director', a super loud (105 decibel) megaphone for $10! Awesome! Once we returned to CPK, we were promptly seated and served our drinks. We had a scratcher coupon that we were supposed to have the manager scratch off for us. He arrived, scratched and proudly proclaimed that we had won 20% off our bill tonight. Awesome! After our huge 20% off triumph, (every other table around us won 10% off, suckers) we ordered our pizzas. I'm positive that these delicious pizzas are not traditional in the slightest bit, but who cares? Everything in the world could use a little work for the better... Except my Apryl, of course! I serious doubt that Jack & Rose were really on the Titanic, so who cares if there is Bar-B-Qued chicken on top of your pizza? I had the Sicilian and Apryl had the Club. We both dipped our slices into a very delicious ranch dressing. My pizza was both tasty and greasy... Just how I like it. Apryl couldn't stop raving about how delicious her pizza was. Our drinks were refilled in a timely manner and upon receipt of our bill, 20% was taken off just as promised. Awesome! Overall, it was a very good experience.

SERVICE I have to agree with Brendan S's statement about service, that they seem genuinely disinterested.  It seems rather appropriate that along with the hollow feeling of the ambiance (see below), you feel the wait staff is simply robotic or in a stat of zombie-ism. I honestly can't even remember if our server was a man or woman because they were just so non-existent.  Oddly, I have the same critique of the staff in San Diego as I do in Seattle.  Everything is almost exactly the same and I wonder if there's a special training for being so invisible.  AMBIANCE There's something pretty uninviting about the decor that I just can't quite describe.  It seems designed to be pretty or pleasing, but superficially so.   Perhaps that's a great tie-in to the idea of being quite ""Californian"".   It has just enough substance to seem aesthetically pleasing, but there's just nothing that anyone to think it's remarkable on any level.  Others may disagree, but the ambiance just seems, well, hollow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=280

Some of the pizza is good. I highly recommend the California Club pizza, we get it every time and it does not disappoint. Skip the five cheese pizza with tomato, it is an artery clogging load of cheese and their is no sauce on the pizza.  The atmosphere is nice, even a bit trendy for this style of restaurant. What gets me every time i come here is the service. The last time I came I had a coupon from their rewards program and asked the server if the promotional value worked towards alcohol, he did not know and said he would ask his manager. He came back and said his manager did not know and said we should read the fine print. Funny part about that is there was no fine print and its their program. They should know how it works and you NEVER tell your customer to read the fine print. That is YOUR job. Needless to say, the promo did work with alcohol.

I ordered the mushroom ravioli and I received literally 12 ravioli and found myself having to fill up on bread to feel full.   On top of that the server dropped my girlfriend's knife on the ground and didn't get her another one.  She forgot to include any salad dressing with my girlfriend's salad.  And she forgot to bring us a bread basket.  It was funny because she asked us if we wanted bread and we said yes and yet mistook it for no?

Carolyn S.,"Carlsbad, CA",982,401,10,4.0,6/3/2007,"Well, CPK (California Pizza Kitchen) has their formula down: nice (somewhat Americanized) menu selection, lots to choose from really, particularly since this is a pizza place. I have tell you, I love that they offer you a choice between honey wheat and white dough for their pizzas. It makes it so much easier to justify those extra couple of pieces as I scarf them down! Nice! Similarly, they are always accommodating about replacing the white dough for wheat in the hummus appetizer and the tasty bruschetta! No matter how busy they get here. Both appetizers are very tasty, very fresh. The salads are without surprises; exactly as they are written up on the menu. YELPer buddies, everything on the menu is spelled out in excruciating detail....that's what happens when several attorneys get together and make their own eatery. That my friends is how the California Pizza Kitchen began! Years ago, I applied to work at their Beverly Hills location, I don't remember if I was hired there or not, I ended up working for Trumps and The Four Seasons instead. I do remember the manager bragging that they require a two week training and testing period once you get the job. They apparently (at least then) thought it crucial that servers be able to flawlessly recite the ingredients of each recipe. Frankly, this could be a large part of the service challenge other YELPers have noted at CPK.  Who cares whether or not your server has committed the recipes to memory!?! The menu is written in English, is detailed and we all can read. Any waiter (or customer) will learn menu ingredients with time and exposure. I'd much rather the chef focus on the cooking, the menu descibe the food and the wait staff learn to focus their attention on the anticipated and very real needs of their clientele. Service sense and attitude mattered more to Trumps and to The Four Seasons, probably why both are legendary for quality of food and quality of service. For what it is: decent food, wholewheat alternatives and usually decent service, CPK is worth stopping by.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=280

I soon felt nauseated by the whole situation & only drank 1/2 that stupid dirty glass of wine.  Then, proceeded to hope for the best & ate my dinner along w/ my family off those probably dirty plates.  I did manage to get the attention of the manager in this issue & he was from what he said completely embarrassed & actually acknowledged that the glasses & carafe were dirty.  He comped one glass of wine.  WTF?  This place is gross, gross, gross.  Don't go there.  Stand up for yourself & your right to clean & friendly service.  I will never return as there are just too many better alternatives & I love good service.  By the way, the 1 star is for the hostess.

I understand they had to scale things back, but when I ordered a chopped salad recently, the amount of salami in the entire salad couldn't have even made one decent cracker-sized slice. Most recently I ordered the quesadilla small plate, which was supposed to have chicken, and I almost sent it back when I failed to find any chicken in one quarter slice of the quesadilla. I opened another slice up and saw a couple of microscopic bits hiding in the melted cheese so I didn't complain, but really, is that all you can spare? Again, the amount in the entire order wouldn't have amounted to a decent bite. I usually go there in off hours and the service is extremely inattentive. I have to prop my hand up and wave it and wave it until I can hope someone walks by and doesn't ignore it. When they are at your table they are usually very nice and accommodating but then they disappear. They also don't bring bread unless you ask, so if I forget to ask, I probably won't see a waiter again until I'm ready for the check unless I can flag down a busboy.

N G.,"San Diego, CA",41,114,,2.0,8/9/2007,"First off, I'd like to say I'm giving CPK the benefit of the doubt here by giving them 2 stars mostly because I frequent the place due to friends liking it, and the fact that they have about 4 items on the menu that aren't too horrible. I considered giving them 3 stars, but because of the horrible service I tend to get and the overpriced menu, I am sticking with 2. Basically the only things on the menu that I find pretty good are the BBQ chicken pizza and portobello mushroom ravioli. The sandwiches are decent too, but over all I'd rather go somewhere else for this sort of food. The thing that drives me crazy is that the Portobello mushroom ravioli is almost $11 and the BBQ chicken pizza is like 12 now! It was expensive as it was, but now they raised the prices of the pizza an extra dollar! Who in their right mind at CPK decided that was a good idea? $11 for a little personal pizza wasn't enough profit for them? That alone and the lack of particularly good food was reason enough to give this place a bad score, but CPK seems to be notorious for bad service! On multiple occasions we've had food either come out wrong or not at all! At times they have tried to fix their mistake by not charging us, but give me a break, how hard is it to bring out a stupid pizza in a reasonable amount of time? I apologize to the servers out there that are actually nice and good, but I think at least 2/3 of the time I get bad service.  Overall, I'd say try out the food and see if you like it, but if you do go, make it a rare occurrence.

Lulu D.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,,3.0,3/27/2011,"Well, it's too freakin' expensive for what you get! $10.49 for a half of a grilled veggie salad? Really? Also, the price for drinks really frustrates me - $2.49 for iced tea! I know that's where they make their money and it's pretty standard across the board at restaurants now, but ouch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=300
Albie F.,"Sunnyvale, CA",276,771,67,4.0,3/16/2007,"I know they got a whole lot of locations and I'm usually not big on chain restaurants, but I just tried their new mango tandoori chicken pizza and it's quite an interesting blend of flavors.   From what I can remember in the past, I tried their peking duck pizza and I thought their prices were a little overpriced but I give them credit, they got some interesting stuff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=300
Nikki K.,"San Diego, CA",85,164,2,3.0,5/22/2009,"4 or 5 years ago, the girls and I used to go here a couple times a week for lunch. That's when they had the bacon gorgonzola salad with crispy onion rings on top. That's gone. Then they had the steakhouse chopped salad (the name suggests there is steak on the salad but alas, there is not). That's gone. Their Rustica pizza with fresh mozarella, kalamata olives and tomatoes was my favorite thin crust pizza. That's gone. WTF CPK? Why must they constantly change the menu when I find something I really like? Oh, not to mention that back in the day they had better bread. It was more sourdoughy than the white bread they have now. The manager told me people were complaining that the bread was too hard so they changed it. Duhhh, crusty bread is supposed to be crusty!  The girls & I decided on CPK for lunch today because we hadn't been there in so long as a group. I'll go there sometimes during my lunchbreak and sit at the counter so I can chat with Annie, the sweetest girl ever. She's always on top of what I need and gets me out of there in a hurry so I can get back to work. Annie is usually behind the counter so we got Max as our server today. Max was attentive and patient with us since sometimes we take a while to order. We're too busy chatting since we don't see each other every day like we used to. Max even told us that we can still get the steakhouse chopped salad even though it's not on the menu. Good guy that Max. Then I asked Max if the Pesto Chicken Pizza was good & he let me know it's not their best. I opted for the Wild Mushroom Pizza since I know that's good. It has Cremini, Shiitake, Portobello and white mushrooms, Fontina and Mozzarella cheeses with a wild mushroom walnut pesto. That's some good stuff right there. I like their Neopolitan pizza crust (the thin stuff) so I asked for the Mushroom Pizza with the thin crust. Yummm. I still have half of it left but don't even ask, I don't share very well.  Things NOT to get there....the soups (never had a good one, eww), the crab cakes (incredibly small for the price and just so-so in taste), the lettuce wraps (because you'll be looking for PF Chang's quality and not get it), some of the pastas (it's hit or miss, I've had good and bad) and last but not least, the fish (again, it's hit or miss).  I've never had a bad salad and the only reason I've considered a pizza bad was because it was charred. An edge of my pizza today was charred so I ended up cutting off about an inch. It happens with the wood-fired ovens.  I guess I should bump this up to 4* but I'm not going to. Just because nothing is more frustrating than changing the menu all the time. Sure, you want to bring new things onto the menu but how about have a ""Featured Items"" section of things that get rotated. The manager told me that he didn't understand some of their changes either beause they weren't removing the lowest sellers, some of them were high sellers. McDonalds may introduce a new sammich but do they get rid of the Big Mac? No. People actually look forward to the McRib because it's seasonal. Take a hint CPK, don't piss off your customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=300

Kris K.,"Geneva, IL",0,1,,1.0,10/16/2012,Went today with my spous at 5pm. Table was sticky. Menu had changed and was old and worn and cheep. The BBQ chicken salad was horrible. I asked for balsamic dressing and it was plain vinegar no oil with some BBQ sauce poured in streaks on top od the salad.  The chicken piccata was not pounded thin bur sliced. Will not come back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=300
Saya G.,"San Diego, CA",40,79,,5.0,1/18/2012,"I have to agree with a previous poster that the only reason CPK does not get a higher rating is because its a chain.  Its a great restaurant for a healthy, quick, fairly inexpensive, tasty meal.  And I have always GREAT service.  Everything is always fresh too. I usually order the bbq chicken salad and the lettuce is always fresh.  I've been to other chain restaurants and ordered salads and they hide the yucky brown leaves underneath! Not at CPK. And youcan pretty much customize any dish, like PF Changs.  Also, another thing I learned at CPK today. No heat lamps! We ordered the chicken tequila fettuccine for a friend who was running late.  She had not arrived yet so we asked the server to put it under the heat lamp.  The server said that they do not have heat lamps but she would be happy to make ANOTHER pasta dish!  I have never heard this before.  Also, the UTC location is always busy at lunch but the service is always great and they are always checking in on you. I also like that the menu has so much variety to please everyone's tastes: small plates, salads, soups, pizzas, pastas, sandwiches.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=300
