Chey P.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",31,327,6473,4.0,7/31/2015,Today we sat at the patio since it was freezing again inside the restaurant.  Our waitress was nice. I ordered the rib eye steak with potatoes and arugula salad and  my husband had the chicken with garlic sauce and vegetables. I thought the rib eye steak was delicious with the garlic butter.  The arugula salad was okay and the potatoes needed more seasoning. I thought my husband's chicken was overlooked and dry. The sauce was good though.  My daughter had the same dish- Mac and cheese with edamame. She loves it. And we took our brownie and ice cream without whipped cream to go.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-laguna-hills?start=40
Diane C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",595,1015,531,3.0,3/12/2015,"Have been here several times in the last 3 years.  The pizzas are very good.  The soups and salads are pretty standard at all CPK locations and are good.  The only thing that's never cooked right is the pasta.  Although we like al dente pasta, they tend to leave it raw hard.  2-3 minutes more and it would have been perfect al dente.   Overall it's a good place to stop by when I'm here at the mall.  The service is good.  From experience, I'll stay away from the pasta dishes but the pizza is darn good if you like rustic pizzas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-laguna-hills?start=40
Sharif E.,"Irvine, CA",92,4,,2.0,6/8/2017,"All my reviews on yelp are negative, but I guess this is what my life has amounted to. The food was good, the service was great. The reason for my two-star review is because they failed me on the reason I came here. My clients frequently give me gift cards and I received a gift card for CPK. So, when I got the check I slipped in my gift card along with my credit card to cover the exceeding balance without my super hot date seeing the gift card. The server returns and says their gift card system is down and if it's okay for them to just charge the card. Is this a thing? What if I said no? Now my hot date knows I'm a gift carder and I'm back on Bumble. Won't be returning or maybe I'll call ahead to see if their gift card system is online, since I still have this CPK gift card in my wallet mocking me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-laguna-hills?start=40
Lisa H.,"Lake Forest, CA",24,83,92,5.0,8/7/2015,"It's been awhile since we've been to CPK, so we were surprised when we walked in and found new decor and a new menu.  The decor is now done up in woods, Browns, and greens.  Gone are the 90's era pizza box art on the walls, replaced by great photography and an absolutely gorgeous color palette!   The hubs was disappointed that they no longer had his ""white pizza"" on the menu,  that was just one of the many items no longer offered.  But there are still some of the regular faves, the Tuscan Hummus being one of them. We ordered the Hawaiian pizza and the Sicilian thin crust pizza.  Both were excellent.  The Sicilian had a hint of spiciness, and the crust was perfectly thin!  The Hawaiian pizza had scallions on it, which was a nice addition. For dessert the butter cake with vanilla ice cream was my man's choice, perfect as always!  ( My man AND the dessert) . I ordered the Salted Caramel Pudding!  Ummmmm I HIGHLY recommend it!   I would have licked the jar clean if I could! Service was impeccable!  Jeff, our waiter, was attentive and personable.  Excellent experience any way you look at it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-laguna-hills?start=40
Heidi S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",34,283,48,4.0,3/17/2016,We usually go to CPK on Marguerite but have stopped in to this place twice in the past few weeks.  The service is consistent and the food is always good.  Parking is very easy and they offer curbside service.  Sign up for the loyalty program app - I use it and frequently get $5 off coupons.  My son always gets the BBQ Chicken pizza and I am a fan of the 5 Cheese and Tomato as well as the Tortilla Soup - all of it is very good and made fresh.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-laguna-hills?start=40
Joe Y.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,32,8,4.0,4/25/2016,"As I found out, this is not exactly the best place to go if you are looking to eat healthy or low calorie.  My server Emma was very helpful and accommodating with my request for healthy meal suggestions. She went and shared with me another menu with the calorie numbers next to the meals.  Ended up choosing the BBQ chicken sandwich and a salad which came to 700 calories or so and not nearly as much fat as most of the other meals.

Vina O.,"Downers Grove, IL",473,679,22,3.0,2/28/2016,"Like most CPK locations, this place is fairly busy most nights despite being located in a very sad mall. They seem to be understaffed as our server seemed to be a bit forgetful about bringing things we asked for because he was so busy attending to several other tables as well. Despite this, he remained pleasant as much as possible. As always, I LOVE their salads. I rarely order salads at restaurants, but CPK is the exception. Their California cobb and roasted veggie salads are my favorites!

Sylvia C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,5,,2.0,3/30/2017,"They used to have wonderful salads.  Unfortunately, like so many restaurants, they are now using processed chicken instead of chicken breasts.  They are made to look like a chicken breast but they taste terrible and the texture is gross.  I only go there because my granddaughter likes it but it's expensive for what you get and there is nothing on the menu I like anymore.  They used to have a meatless salad that, I think, had kale.  It was delicious but they took it off the menu.  Of course.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-laguna-hills?start=40
Jamal O.,"Lake Forest, CA",78,66,52,5.0,1/5/2016,"We had an excellent experience here!  Our server was fantastic, and it was our 2yr olds birthday and we got a complimentary kids sundae to celebrate.  The server got our refills without having to ask, made good suggestions, and even though they were busier than the first time we came here, the service was very fast, which was great for us so we could do a mini bday celebration, and get back home in time for the kids' bed time.  We used to regularly go to the location at Bella terra, which also has great service.  The one at fashion island I have been to a couple times and every time we had some problem, so these two locations are very well run.  Nice, varied menu, good service, recently remodeled, a little smaller than a typical CPK, but now that we just moved to the area, nice to know a place we can go that everyone in the family likes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-laguna-hills?start=40

A J.,"San Clemente, CA",0,53,,4.0,5/10/2015,"It's CPK... what's there to say? Actually, I'm only reviewing the restaurant today, on Mother's Day, because I haven't been in years and I was VERY impressed with the staff. First, a manager presented carnations to the two mothers in our party before we were seated. That was a nice touch. Then, our server, Jordan, was extremely enthusiastic and cheerful, despite working her socks off for the Mother's Day crowd. You could tell the entire staff was feeling the pressure, but none of them seemed to mind. And, finally, Luis... a busser, who was right in the thick of it. At one point, a manager was walking across the dining room with some dishes he had cleared from a table. He unknowingly dropped a napkin on the floor and kept going. Moments later, Luis came around the corner, on his way to clear another table. Luis saw the napkin and immediately picked it up. I like that. I like that Luis took enough pride in the restaurant to pick up the napkin, even though he wasn't the one who dropped it. You may think this is a small thing, but many employees at many different restaurants would walk right past that napkin, either because they wouldn't notice it, or because they would pretend they didn't notice it. Nice job, Luis. Now, the bad. I ordered the Habanero Carnitas pizza. It was delicious, except for the fact that it had tons of onions on it... onions that weren't mentioned on the menu... onions that I would have asked to be held, had the menu listed them in the description. Ugh. Onions. Needless to say, I picked them off and moved on, and I'm still giving 4 stars because of how well the staff performed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-laguna-hills?start=60
anne r.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,12,,2.0,6/5/2017,"Really expensive & Not a good experience. Spent $83 for 2 adults/1child & no alcohol. Oh & I had soup & salad- child had kids menu cheese pizza only. We made a reservation ahead of time only to find when we arrived they gave our table away. This was dinner hour so the only place they could put us is outside. Well there was a wind whipping & we were cold. When we ordered we asked for the heat lamps to be turned on. They said yes no one came. We waited & waited. I could see the busboy cleaning tables & another sweeping floors-no one came out. Finally I went in to ask for the heaters to turn on. The busboy came out. We tried to stay outside but it was too cold. The kid was complaining so we asked to be moved. They found a table & brought us inside.  Once settled they brought out soup. Within minutes they then brought the main dish. I said to the server we just got our soup. She replied the food will go under the heat lamp until were ready. Really? WTF?!!  Food was only average.

Angie M.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",159,1230,4829,4.0,3/16/2013,"Had dinner here tonight, with my parents. I actually stepped outside my normal ordering box and tried the Kung Pao Spaghetti, with chicken and shrimp.  It was really good! Once I removed the red peppers, and the tails off the shrimp... it had great flavor and just a tiny kick for a few bites. I would have preferred the tails were off the shrimp, but what are you going to do. My Dad ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza, and my Mom tried the Brussel Sprout and Bacon Pizza.  Yes, you read that right, lol.  It was actually really good - but a bit dry.  It needed a little something else to make it a tad more... moist.  She got the wheat dough as well.  Yum!

Deborah H.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,10,,4.0,8/23/2016,"I'm giving CPK 4 Stars for their lunch menu and the great service that I received last night.  The lunch duo is fantastic. My favorite is the super spinach quinoa is delicious. I was craving it so I thought I would go to CPK for dinner. Sadly, this delicious salad is not on the dinner menu which makes no sense to me. I figured I couldn't go wrong with their pizza since it is always so yummy. WRONG. Apparently, I didn't realize the spicy marinara was in the Sicilian pizza I ordered. It was way too hot for me. I also ordered the chicken tequila fettuccine because it was marked as a favorite. I didn't care for it all. Our server, Emily was very perceptive and saw that I wasn't eating much. She asked if she could bring me something else from the menu.  I told her that I felt bad and it wasn't necessary. She insisted. Then her manager, Elaine, came over and apologized that I didn't care for the food and insisted I order something else. Both of these ladies were kind and sincere and I was very impressed with their customer service. I ordered a third item, shrimp scampi zucchini. The sauce was thin, not creamy. It tasted like fresh squeezed lemon sauce. I did not let them know that I was disappointed again but I will not be going back to CPK for dinner again. The dinner menu was a disappointment and was way overpriced. I will however look forward to returning to CPK for lunch as long as they keep their lunch duo on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-laguna-hills?start=60

They made is so easy and I've gotten so many compliments on the party.  For $10 a kid they make their own pizza, tour the restaurant and get ice cream.

I waited in the front waiting area with my small child for the order. After 30 minutes, I decided to ask what was taking so long. Turns out my order was in the food warmer behind the counter I had been waiting near. This irked me, as waiting with a child is never an easy experience.  How long had my food been waiting?

Deb L.,"Laguna Hills, CA",2,17,,1.0,12/12/2017,"Update: since I posted the below review, I have been searching for a good Chinese chicken salad to replace California Pizza Kitchen's, which has recently been taken off the menu. Good news! I have found a good substitute! Pick Up Stix Chinese restaurant has an excellent one-as good as CPK's, and less expensive. Now I have no reason to patronize CPK again, since that salad was the best thing on the menu. .................... I have been  coming to Ca Pizza Kitchen for years and have ordered the Chinese chicken salad for years. It is so tasty, that even when I stopped eating meat, I replaced the chicken with avocado and continued to order this delicious salad. Today I attempted to place my usual order only to learn this salad has been taken off the menu.  The salad choices are now largely high caloric salads. The newest salad, which apparently replaced the Chinese chicken salad, is an arugula asparagus salad which is a poor substitute. The waiter told  me many people continue to ask for the Chinese chicken salad. I guess i'll have to find another restaurant for my weekly salad obsession.

Most people got their drinks first, but one person didn't get theirs so they had to ask. They got theirs after we got our appetizers. To drink I got a Coke. To start they just had bread, olive oil and butter that came out for everyone. I liked the olive oil.  After appetizers we all ordered for our entree. I got the roasted garlic chicken thin crust pizza. My Mom got a cob salad with beets and she gave some of that to me. It was good, I liked the ranch. My Mom didn't get beets with her cob salad though. She realized that when we got the bill. My Aunt also gave me some of her asparagus and arugula salad with shrimp. I liked it, especially the shrimp. My pizza turned out alright. It was kinda skimpy on the toppings though. It was like they stopped stopped putting toppings on 1/4th of the pizza near the crust.  We got dessert. My Aunt had ordered it in advance, we didn't know she did until it came out. My Cousin got a free fudge sundae thing with a candle for his birthday. We also had butter cake and a chocolate souffle.

They have tossed on a few new seafood items including the halibut and cedar plank salmon.  Also added is a ribeye steak.  Not just pizza and salads any more.  We both decided on the salmon. It can with a spinach and corn hash that accompanied the dish perfectly. We also got a side of their tequila jalapeño lime dressing to dip the salmon in.  The salmon was good, but a bit on the dry side, so the dressing added a nice flavor twist.  The service was friendly, but they were very busy.    This mall does not provide much traffic for many of the businesses here and for a location that is usually not too busy, it was tonight.  Overall, a good experience and would be back to try something else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-laguna-hills
Carlene P.,"Lake Forest, CA",39,238,187,5.0,7/8/2017,"The Laguna Hills Mall is under complete renovation, but fear not - CPK is open! I loved the ability to place take-out orders online  -  you're given the choice to pay with a card online or to pay when you arrive.  Nice to have this choice.   The take-out pick-up counter is at the bar or you can request curbside pick-up.  Since the mall is under reconstruction, it's not busy so it's always easy to find good parking. The service was excellent.  The waiter was outgoing, polite, and let me know that it would be just a minute or two longer before my order was ready.  He offered bread with the salad which comes with olive oil for dipping.  I wasn't crazy about this, but if that's your thing, they've got your covered. My husband ordered the Hawaiian pizza and although good, he felt it was too heavy on the ham.  Next time he'll just get a pineapple pizza most likely (hey, don't judge...he's a great guy!) I had a Caesar salad and it was quite good.  Very generous with both the parm and the croutons.  Could maybe have used just a smidge more dressing, but it was still tasty.   The kids pizza is just about the right size for little ones without huge appetites and it comes with either juice, milk or soda.   There is outside patio dining or indoors.  As with most CPK's this location is very modern and clean.  They just need to build the rest of the mall around it and this place will be standing room only.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-laguna-hills

Lots of folks, waiting, at CPK, for...? Disappointment?  So I want a whiskey drink, like a manhattan. The server returns and says they don't have the whiskey I want. ""No Maker's, okay what other nice bourbons do you have?"" She starts rattling off liquors, that aren't bourbon, or even whiskey.  I tell her those aren't bourbons. The lead guy comes over, and states they have Jameson's, which is Irish, Jim Beam Honey, which is gross, and Crown Royal. That's it. Apologies... ""It was a holiday when we wanted to order our liquor, and, well, we missed the date etc., so no delivery...""  I got a beer, and my wife had a sangria, which was peachy and very, very sweet.  They servers were nice, but it's hard to peddle in the crap that's left over due to mismanagement.  Pizza: I really like the pear and gorgonzola combination. Not this time. The gorgonzola was almost absent, and was so in flavor, and the pears were thickly sliced and hard. Hard. Not at all ripe. The pizza was scantly topped, lacking in flavor, and a hug disappointment. Blah. CPK bbq chicken salad: I've had this many times. This time was not the charm. Lacking in flavor, and the lettuce had that mouth feel that it sat in a ziplock bag over night. Not horrid or anything, but not good by any means. Just very disappointing overall.

David E.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",38,843,,3.0,7/30/2017,As with other chains of this type they have adjusted their menu in order to better appeal to the masses.  There still isn't much of a health conscious focus here but of course the nutritional information is provided so you can make better choices. ITALIAN CHOPPED SALAD -- I would never notice that the turkey breast was roasted since it is in tiny cubes (still better than slivers or strips of meat given this type of salad); salami; garbanzo beans; tomatoes (I had to veto for health reasons); mozzarella; fresh basil; mustard herb vinaigrette The dressing tastes like it sounds as it's a combo of Italian dressing meats mustard.  It's good but the Italian flavor prevails over the mustard making it much less detectable.  The salami is in thin strips.  There is a pretty ample amount of meat.  The salad is a good portion (large) but at $17.00 feels a bit costly for what it is.   Cubes of fairly soft bread are served with a herb olive oil dipping sauce (not enough in the container). The STAFF are friendly and the dining room is similar to my last memory of it.  My guess is I haven't been inside of one of these in 16 years.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-laguna-hills

We were told there was 4 minute wait (not 5) but 4.   So we waited while two other groups that came in AFTER us were seated first. We were finally called about five minutes later (not 4) and when I questioned the hostess as to why the other two groups were seated first she became very defensive and said that it was not her fault and that one of the waiters had come and seated the groups that came in after us. She even proceeded to ask the waiter in question to come over and apologize to us even after I told her that that wasn't necessary.  The hostess did not offer an apology. What she should have done is take responsiblity and said, ""I'm sorry for the mistake, let me show you to your table."" Of course she didn't and just acted in a very rude manner though out our interaction with her. I've been here during the week for lunch and the hostesses are usually pretty nice and pleasant compared to this one.   After we were seated, no one came by to take our order. We waited, and waited , and waited, after almost 15 minutes we finally got up and left. Obviously they were too busy or the waiters did not know who was responsible for waiting our table.

Rose A.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,2,,5.0,8/3/2014,"On a Saturday around 2pm, we enjoyed an especially leisurely lunch at California Pizza Kitchen in Laguna Hills.  I've been to other CPK's, but this one seems particularly inviting...extra roomy feel with a vaulted ceiling, clever artwork adorning the walls (be sure to take a closer look at them; wink!), and a cheery-yellow 2 story wall that serves as a backdrop to the lively pizza chefs in the kitchen. Our hostess seated us immediately, even though the restaurant was bustling with diners.  Though I highly recommend the outdoor patio dining at this location, we took a spacious table indoors to avoid the threat of much needed rain.   CPK is known for the uniquely yummy pizzas (go figure), but check out their expansive menu for other great options:   --small plates, including Bianco Flatbread with whipped truffle cream and Crispy Mac & Cheese (can you say ""Mmmm""?) --Pastas dishes spanning from Tequila Fettuccini to Kung Pao Spaghetti (and the traditional fare, for the less adventurous) --Desserts to make any mouth water: Salted Caramel Pudding and a decadent Red Velvet cake, to name a couple. But I go to CPK for their incredibly scrumptious salads, and this time did not disappoint. I tried the Caramelized Peach Salad, and it was a-ma-zing!  Lovely tender spring greens, adorned with warm, sweet peach slices and tangy vinaigrette.  It was a harmonious fusion of nectar and candied cranberries, along with crunchy pecans and savory gorgonzola cheese. I added on the bacon option, which proved heavenly. My sister ordered their classic ""California Cobb"" with CPK's house made Herb Ranch.  Always hardy, it was made even more vibrant with the addition of fresh beet (which delighted her, since that vege is her FAV.) The place was really hopping, so a tad noisy when we first started, but by the time our entrée's arrived, it was already down to joyful lull of cheerful patrons.  The manager, Karleen, made her way around to check in on her happy patrons, stopping by our table for a pleasant chat, before helping a server with an armload of plates.  The entire staff was upbeat, which set a relaxed atmosphere...the way you always hoped casually dining would be. The entrance to the Laguna Hills CPK is off the parking lot between JCP and Macy's; no access from the inside of the mall.  The convenient location might be one reason this restaurant is doing well, despite some store closings recently.  More likely it's the energetic vibe of this place, along with equally tasty dishes and a super welcoming staff.

Jack L.,"Irvine, CA",51,19,8,3.0,9/23/2011,"My family come to this CPK several times a year. This has become one of our restaurants because we got our kids the Simon Kidgits Club from the mall next door. Basically the kids eat for free when we order adult entrees. That's a big plus in my book. Tonight we went again. Being a Friday night, we had to wait a little, about 7-8 minutes. I guess that's just the way it is on Friday nights. Later, after we got seated, the server never brought the bread like they usually do. We asked for it, but was informed that they ran out of bread because they were very busy. Another minus for being Friday night. Food: I ordered their new Habanero Carnitas pizza. It was very delicious. The pork and the cheese were blended together beautifully. I loved the habanero salsa that came with it too. The server warned me that the sauce was very spicy. After I tried it, I felt it was only ok. Note though that I'm a huge fan of spiciness, so if you don't usually eat spicy, I can see it being a little unbearable. My wife ordered the Baby Clam Linguini with Imported Italian Tomatoes (the red sauce version). It was not bad. The pasta had a great taste thanks to the garlic and parmesan used.

Thank goodness I have never had a fly or anything in my food but next time I am going to check closely after reading all the reviews.  I normally get the pizzas because they are the best thing there.  My favorite is the Santa Fe Chicken.  ( ) The color is amazing and the pizza is a perfect blend of salsa, guacamole, and sour cream.  I always have fun spreading the topping out and then scarfing down the pizza.   They got rid of my other favorite pizzas so I keep changing it up by trying other pizzas but they have usually fallen short.  =*( The shrimps in the Shrimp scampi are a little rubbery and the flavor is a little one-dimensional.  The club chicken salad pizza was not too bad even as a left over.  They were very generous on the avocados.  I would still stick with the Santa Fe Chicken.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-laguna-hills?start=120

I don't get how a salad with avocado is close to $15! Its a cafe for crying out loud!

The two ladies in the front glared thinking it was a joke that we were coming in... alone with no ""adults""/parents.

Yes, lady... the teenagers we are, we are going to dine and dash yo ass. Goodness. We took our time-- but she eyed us down. It was uncomfortable. I paid the bill and she never came back to say Thank You or Have a Good Night. Worst CPK location, ever.

Krystal R.,"Anaheim, CA",209,188,198,4.0,7/1/2010,"Thank you to CPK for being open until 10pm. I have visited many CPK locations, but on our last visit we were utterly grateful for the wonderful service and delicious food we received. After being disappointed from a couple surrounding restaurants for dinner service a little after 9, we were welcomed here with arms wide open! I half-heartedly thanked the general manager for allowing us to come and dine with us. He assured me that he was not shooing us away, but setting up a table to enjoy our dinner. I had explained our situation that we were not helped by a couple surrounding restaurants, and he had told me that is not the case here at CPK. The hostess, server and manager were all very welcoming and the manager assured us that they would serve us without a problem. That put all the anxiety away and we were finally able to celebrate my cousin's high school graduation with ease. Our sweet server quickly got everyone a round of drinks, and although since it was a busy night for graduation - there was no bread available - they were still able to provide some pita bread as a starter. Menu selections are great here - the pizzas and salads are always great items to share and enjoy by all. The avocado club eggrolls are pretty mouth-watering delicious, and the spinach artichoke dip is always delicious, too. For those will small appetites, they now feature a small cravings menu - little bites - just enough to fill you up without too much food leftover.  My mom and I had split the Thai Crunch salad and we each got a small bowl of the Dakota Smashed Pea & Barley soup. It's very light and has small chunks of barley, and a beautiful puree of split pea, carrots and onions. It's always been a CPK favorite of mine, and my favorite way to start my meal. Thai Crunch salad is a refreshing taste of Thai food. It has tons of grilled chicken breast pieces and lots of veggies of beautiful julienned cucumbers, carrots, freshly chopped cilantro, cabbage, tiny slivers of green onions and lots of little edamame in the salad. I love the sweet tang of the thai-peanut dressing and the crunch from the peanuts and rice sticks and crispy wontons. It's my favorite salad they serve next to the Original BBQ chicken salad. My uncle and cousins had split that salad paired with BBQ chicken pizza. We had plenty of food for the 7 of us, and the kids had ordered macaroni and cheese and another pasta dish. Which was quite creamy and cheesy, a fair comparable and a step up from the blue box version. Overall, we were happily stuffed and celebrated a wondrous occasion at CPK.

I have been here about 15 times already and each time was a pleasant experience. In fact my family and I were just talking about how a friendly waitress who consistently served us has now become a manager there. We were really happy for her and we felt like she definitely deserved it! The only reason why I did not give this place a 5 star is for the food quality. It's good for what it is, but definitely not 5 star quality for its class. I know my review may sound bias since we are loyal customers, but the only reason why we are loyal customers is because they were so friendly from the get-go!

But then I saw the Roasted Veggie Salad, which I also used to love the hell out of.  I've had better, at other CPK's.  This one, had some weird things in it, like a Bay Leaf I believe, which I was gnawing on and had to dig out of my teeth.  And I added salmon (this is now a $20 salad, full size plus salmon) and the salmon was not good.  It was dry, seemed like maybe it had been fried?  Weird.  Also I remember the veggies being warm on the salad, these were not.  Maybe that is my faulty memory.  But the salmon was possibly from the day before, and was not good.  But I am not one to make a huge fuss at a restaurant unless I think I might get food poisoning. Other than that, everything was great.  Matt was our server, on the patio.  We were alone on the patio, as we had a 3 1/2 year old with LOTS OF ENERGY with  us, also my sister is still breastfeeding the baby, and my grandma's friend is 92, and super spry, but I don't know how well her hearing is for a restaurant atmosphere, at lunch...it can get loud.  So the patio was perfect for us, we were not irritating other diners, we could hear eachother, and my sister could whip out her boob to feed the baby without much concern.   Matt was very nice and attentive and brought us everything we needed, was good with the toddler, etc.  Thank you Matt. All the rest of the food was good, from what I understand.  My sister got the Sedona Tortilla Soup, no complaints.  My mom and nephew both had the split pea soup or whatever. Barley?  Said it was good.  My nephew pretty much ate the bread non stop, not sure how much soup he ingested.  Grandma's friend had her standard Cobb or Club (?)

Chelsea M.,"Fullerton, CA",628,573,156,4.0,11/17/2015,"Brussels + Bacon Flatbread ($8.29) is topped with roasted Brussels sprouts, sweet caramelized onions, Nueske's Applewood smoked bacon, creamy goat cheese, Romano, and cracked black pepper. It hits the flavor spikes with sweet onion, roasted Brussels sprouts, smoky & salty bacon, and creamy goat cheese. A pesto drizzle would add a nice herbaceous component to tie everything together. Rating: 4.3/5 Fire-Grilled Ribeye ($25.99) is a 12 oz. USDA choice ribeye with house made Pinot Noir sea salt, topped with creamy bleu cheese butter, and served with roasted fingerling potatoes and lemon-garlic arugula salad. The ribeye is tender, juicy, and grilled to perfection and cuts like butter. The compound butter brings out the sweetness of the beef while also adding a pungent yet paired flavor. The potatoes are roasted perfectly with a crispy side and a pleasing herbaceous flavor. The arugula salad's bitterness is tempered by the lemon garlic vinaigrette and reminiscent of a fresh spinach. Rating: 4.8/5 Sunny Side Up Bacon + Potato Pizza ($15.99) is topped with shaved fingerling potatoes, Nueske's Applewood smoked bacon, caramelized leeks, parmesan, mozzarella, fresh cracked black pepper, and two sunny-side eggs. Breakfast pizza any time! The crust is crispy yet tender and chewy like a good bread. The yolk makes this pizza even sexier with is bright orange color and sensual flow as it ends up on the pizza, on your fingers, and on your face. Definitely, yolk porn! If this would be shared, opting for two extra sunny side eggs would make everyone happy. The thinly cut potatoes can be a little inconsistent ranging from cooked just right to just hard and dry from the high heat. Cubing the potatoes like O'Brien potatoes might work better. Rating: 4.3/5 Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pizza ($13.49) is topped with chipotle adobo sauce, shaved poblanos, Monterey jack, house made roasted corn & black bean salsa, and lime crema. The fiery colors on this pizza pop when presented - green, yellow, and red with contrasting black beans and golden crust. The Hispanic flavor palette ranges from the smoky chipotle, sweet bell peppers and corn, starchy beans, to a pleasant spicy kick at the end. Less vegetables or more chicken would be preferable to bring out more of the smoky chipotle flavor. Rating: 4.3/5 Hearth-Roasted Halibut ($23.79) is wild caught Alaskan halibut roasted on a cedar plank with grilled asparagus and butternut squash farro & baby kale. The halibut is succulent with the slight smoky cedar flavor and fresh taste of the sea. Butternut squash farro and baby kale taste like a cheesy, nutty risotto with a touch of sweetness from the butternut squash. The thin asparagus adds a sweet greenness to the dish. Rating: 4.5/5 S'mores ($5.50) is kettle cooked Belgian chocolate pudding, dark chocolate chunks, double graham crackers, and toasted marshmallows. The decorative preserves jar makes the s'mores the focal point. The Belgian chocolate pudding acts as your melted chocolate but is cool like a dense mousse. Double graham crackers add a crunchy texture and sweet wheat flavor. Marshmallows are perfectly torched and gooey for a short while. The cold pudding makes the marshmallows solidify too fast. Marshmallow fluff might be better to preserve the texture of the dish. It will achieve the torched exterior yet stay gooey and soft with the pudding. Rating: 4.3/5",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-laguna-hills?start=20
Jennifer H.,"Lake Forest, CA",688,214,244,5.0,11/15/2015,"I have to say I love the changes CPK has made both in their decor and food which is second only to (if you can believe it because I have always loved their service) an improvement in their service. I experienced this transformation firsthand in the grand opening of the Irvine store in which I sampled so many amazing new menu items and drinks that I am constantly recommending them to friends and family and CPK has a spot on my go to list. But I digress. Since my last review of this particular location I have dined here twice and both times the food, drink and service were topnotch. Last visit I convinced my husband to try the ribeye and he was not disappointed. ""One of the best steaks I've ever eaten,"" he commented. I just smiled, having sampled it already at the opening while I dined on my personal favorite the thai chicken pizza which I am pleased to say this store has lightened up big time on the carrots and it was cooked thoroughly (Thank you!!!!) He is still sore that CPH eliminated the cheesburger pizza but is fast overcoming his grudge. Yesterday I came in with a friend and having raved about the Blood Orange Sangria we both had one then shared my next favorite: the mushroom pizza with truffle oil and a garden salad. She loved the pizza and liked her drink, too. I am always happy to introduce people to new things and being a foodie that is on the top of my list. The pizza was perfectly cooked, the mushrooms just delicious and the added truffle oil of course made it amazing. Our drinks were a little strong but hey who am i to complain? :) They were very good. So I am a fan again and very happy for the changes. My friend, having not been in since the changes, remarked that she was glad this store was given a facelift and is glad to see many other restaurants following suit.  ""They're making more food that we like!"" she said while enjoying a mouthful of yummy mushroom goodness. Indeed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-laguna-hills?start=20

The kids crayon packs have 3 crayons while the kids menu has a preprinted requirement of 4 colors for several activities. That is absolutely brilliant! Way to go CPK!. The food  at this location is completely and totally mehhhh... I always end up with one of their cardboard tasting and looking pies. After I eat here, I ask myself what the hell I was thinking in being willing to come here again. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! none the less,  Now to make things even more fun and exciting. The service is kinda haphazard and they appear to have servers, not waiters. Dont expect to get much ""service""  from the wait staff as they are too busy to bother with you most of the time. Also I suggest that you make sure to check your bill everytime, as on more than one occasion I have had an incorrect bill. It is a serious pain in the butt, but yeah, I am not a fan of this location whatsoever. If you are coming to CPK, plan to park near firestone or macys as the parking adjacent to cpk is almost always full.

Matt R.,"San Clemente, CA",144,85,25,3.0,5/27/2016,"Usually really enjoy CPK but we went to this location by default as it was right after the Laguna Hills adventure run.  We generally go to the location at the Irvine Spectrum as we work out there. We came to this location and I was disappointed as they don't have happy hour like other locations. That's one of the bug draws for us to come here.  The service was good and the food of course was what we always expect and I was happy with those aspects of our visit but honestly CPK has a great happy hour but until this location starts that, I don't think we will come back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-laguna-hills?start=20

Arthur S.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,30,,2.0,8/23/2011,"We went there for dinner on a Monday night; I'd never (I believe) been to this particular CPK.  It wasn't very crowded, and one employee opened the door for us - and did the same when we eventually departed.  That can't be a very rewarding task.  We were told to sit anywhere.  The restaurant was airy, well lit, and scrupulously clean. And there we sat, and sat, and sat.  There seemed to be a few staff running around on the not-particularly-crowded facility, so they weren't understaffed.  After about 15 minutes, a waitress came over and gave us menus.  She was quite pleasant. We sat for quite a while longer, somewhat astonished, and the lady finally came back and took our drink and entree orders.  I decided to get a mixed drink because the wine seemed to be grossly overpriced - with three (!) and six ounce glasses, the latter size of Berringer being something like $8.50.  That's about twice the cost of a bottle. After quite a while, she showed up and reported that the drinks were somewhat slow because of a ""new bartender.""  We asked where in the world the glasses of water we requested happened to be. The water finally showed up, carried in by a gentleman who I suspect was the manager.  He asked if everything was fine so far, and I had to say ""no"". The drinks eventually arrived (toted by yet another waitress!) and I found that my mai tai was essentially fruit juice with almost no discernible alcohol.  I'm not much of a drinker, to put it mildly, but normally a mai tai has some kick.  My wife had tried a strawberry concoction promoted on a little stand-up placard on the table, and didn't particularly like it.  But that's not really a complaint; she was sorry she hadn't gotten a margarita. Eventually the food showed up.  My wife had some sort of salad with shrimp, and a lentil soup.  The salad was sizable and good, and while the soup was a bit more watery than most soups of that type, she thought it was tasty.  I had a chicken piccata with thin spaghetti.  I thought the three ample pieces of chicken were rather tasteless, but were OK with the decent piccata sauce.  And the pasta may not have been ""homemade"", but was fine.  We were quite astonished to never receive any sort of bread or rolls with the meal - if I'm not ordering a pizza this would seem to be a reasonable expectation. The water glasses were refilled once, a little later than I would have liked as it was toward the end of the meal.  We decided to forego any desert, not wanting to spend a huge amount of additional time. The check was finally brought to the table, and of course there was the now-expected fairly long delay in fetching it and in bringing the credit card bill to the table. This meal, with a small promotional coupon from the Sunday newspaper, came to $40 before tip.  I think this was a little high given this type of meal, although not grossly so.  But we walked out fairly unhappy due to the slow service.  I'm not expecting fast-food sort of customer turnaround, of course; the slowness tonight really was beyond reason.  I suppose if I go back to a CPK, it will be the one a few miles away on Marguerite in Mission Viejo. I'd say the two star rating is more than fair for this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-laguna-hills?start=100

Its pretty good for being a large chain and offers something on the menu for everyone. * Spicy Chicken Tinga Quesadilla - pretty good. I actually appreciated the various peppers and onions. It gave the quesadilla a good balance and the feeling being more than your average quesadilla. * Waldorf Chicken Salad - pretty good. the candied walnuts were tasty * Sicilian Pizza - got the thin crust Sicilian and had a nice balance of ingredients. My only complaint is they don't have a discount deal when getting more than 1 pizza like at other pizza joints. You want to try some of the other pizzas, but when getting each of them at full price, you pretty much can only get one on a given outing unless you go with more people. 3 star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-laguna-hills?start=100

After 35 minutes we asked how much longer and were told it would be just a few minutes longer. Everyone that had come after us was seated, therefore after a wait of 50 minutes we asked how much longer one of the receptionist told us our problem is that we have 5 people and it would be another 20 minutes or so at this time we became irritated because we were lied to at every turn. The reception which consisted of 2 girls and the manager Kevin were completely non responsive and rude. There was no effort to tell us the possible wait time and no good will gesture to seat us by combining two tables together. After getting rather upset we were seated and there were 3 tables set up available for seating of  our party and 1 table that needed to be set up. There was no effort made to seat us or accommodate us in any way. The manager Kevin was egotistical and aloof the girls were arrogant and rude.
