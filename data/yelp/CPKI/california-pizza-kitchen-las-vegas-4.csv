Larissa K.,"North Las Vegas, NV",55,78,31,4.0,1/4/2018,Love this beautiful outdoor mall and love this restaurant to boot. Ordered a small salad loaf and split margarita pizza. I had to ask for extra dressing as the salad was pretty dry. You can't please everyone in this department so no stars taken off for this.  Our waitress was polite and efficient. Margareta pizza was delicious however there were dry spots missing cheese. Not enough cheese. A pizza restaurant that lacks cheese on it's pizza. Step it up folks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4
Christy K.,"Las Vegas, NV",37,88,178,5.0,12/23/2017,"CPK is one of my favorite restaurants (after Cheesecake Factory). The pizza is great, but my favorite dishes are their salads. The Thai Crunch Salad includes edamame, peanuts, rice sticks, wonton strips, and a terrific peanut dressing. By ordering the dinner portion and only eating half, I can take home the remainder with extra dressing. When added to lettuce, my leftovers can make 2-3 more meals. They serve bread and olive oil automatically at each table. The bread is made fresh and very tasty (as is the olive oil). Employees at this and other CPKs have always been very professional in their service to customers. When traveling, CPK is a great place to pick up a to-go order to eat back in your hotel room. Call ahead and you'll be out the door in no time at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4

He is the best! He has a charismatic attitude and shows that he loves his job. He remembers our name and is super accommodating.  I love the lunch special with soup and pizza. I usually eat the veggie pizza and potato soup or something ha. I also order a Blueberry Ginger Smash. It's delicious. Sweet.

Eiprheel E.,"Henderson, NV",40,124,469,3.0,11/21/2017,"This location in Town Square is my favorite location bu when we ate here last Sunday, the service lacked. The gentleman who was our host was not the sharpest or the most attentive. We actually had to get from our seats to go to him to ask for items that we needed. He hardly checked up in us and when when our drinks were low, we had to wait a while before he hot to toping off our drinks.  The food was delicious as always. We ordered the Thai Crunch Salad and a small cheese and pepperoni pizza.  I will not rule out not coming back to this place but I will not be in a hurry to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4
Lauren Ann T.,"Southwest, Las Vegas, NV",373,78,139,4.0,10/16/2017,"CPK! The amazing pizza HEAVEN!

Andrew C.,"Las Vegas, NV",427,473,1649,4.0,9/29/2017,"Its been a long time since ive been to CPK. This most recent time, we had decided to come to CPK for dinner for something small, prior to an event nearby. We had arrived around 630-645ish and were seated within 5 minutes. We had opt'ed to sit outside because the weather had been amazing these past few days. One side to outdoor seating was already full. The other side had two 2-person tables left.  Our waiter had came fairly soon after we had been seated and got our drink orders placed. We had both opted for a ""uniquely non-alcoholic"" drink Fresh Strawberry Mango Cooler which consisted of fresh strawberries hand-shaken w/ Fresca and Monin South Seas, featuring natural flavors of mango, guava, and ginger.  Not too sweet. Quite refreshing. Nice to enjoy on a nice day out :) We both had enjoyed our drinks. I ate her strawberries too. There was a slice of lime in the drink too ! No i didnt eat that Lol  --------------------------- Along with our drink orders, we had ordered some food as well. Not too much, but enough to hold us until the event which had desserts and champagne provided.. XD  Before our food came out, we were served with some fresh warm bread with a small bowl of olive oil and herb. The bread was super tasty and fresh. Nice crispy crust and soft inside. The olive oil and herb tasted really nice as well !  Spinach Artichoke Dip served hot with housemade blue & white corn tortilla chips Surprisingly for an appetizer, its quite the large portion of dip. Their housemade chips were thin and crispy. The dip isnt too overpowering/strong but creamy and delicious. Yummy !  Carne Asada Pizza w/ tender marinated steak, fire-roasted poblanos, cilantro pesto, yellow onions, mozzarella, monterey jack cheese and fresh cilantro served with housemade salsa verde This was like... a taco as a pizza. ""New item"" on the menu. Lol the steak was indeed tender, topped with the side of housemade salsa verde really made this like a taco. Very tasty. Fairly decent to try ! Ingredients melded pretty nice and worked well together.  Even with this amount of food, we still had 2 slices of pizza leftover, which i had taken home to eat as a snack later that night HAHA !  ------------------------ Overall, great experience. Was nice to enjoy the nice outdoor weather while its lasts cuz everyone knows vegas weather is bipolar. Also nice to have a nice partner to enjoy it with hehe",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4

Justin C.,"Las Vegas, NV",70,199,3755,5.0,8/17/2017,"Met up with the wife today for lunch at California Pizza Kitchen. We ordered waters and were delivered some warm fresh bread with oil and herbs. I added some balsamic vinegar to make it just right.  This location was recently remodeled and has a new fresh look inside. The staff was very warm and welcoming and even brought us out a Bianco Flatbread for coming in today. This included whipped truffle cream, gorgonzola, mozzarella cheeses and fresh sage. Very nice of them. For the meal we decided on splitting a full size Thai Crunch, we could have had a half size but now I have some leftovers for dinner. The salad was delicious and comes with crisp veggies and fresh cilantro, chicken and peanuts, wontons and rice sticks, then it's tossed in a Thai peanut dressing. We also added fresh avocado to the salad ($3 up charge).  The avo complemented the salad and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal. Thank you CPK  for a great lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4
Lauren C.,"Henderson, NV",284,984,2581,4.0,8/5/2017,"Somehow I just dined at CPK (as people tell me it's called) for the first time. This location is conveniently located smack in the middle of Town Square near Whole Foods and The Container Store. We arrived just before noon and waited a few minutes to be seated. The restaurant was nearly full for lunch on a weekday. Once seated our waitress came over soon after to take our drink orders and then our food orders when we were ready. She didn't waste time getting orders in, but didn't rush us to order either. The menu has a nice variety of options and they definitely offer more than just pizza. The lunch combination option had quite a few items to choose from and was reasonably priced. It includes pizza, sandwiches, soups, and salads. There were fun drink options like non-alcoholic refreshers and teas too. Calorie counts are listed next to each item which made it easy to make a smarter choice. I went with the combination of Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage Pizza and a Caesar Salad. The salad was tasty and I liked the garlic croutons. The pizza was a nice size. I liked the overall flavor and the crust on the pizza. We had to pass on dessert since we were on a lunch break, but they had some good looking options that I'd love to try next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4
Audrey H.,"Las Vegas, NV",663,543,487,4.0,10/29/2017,"We've been here a few times now this year.  Servers are whatever.  Not really there went you need them.  No bread or refills.  Doesn't even come by to check on the table.  It does get busy during lunchtime and dinnertime.  Just happy the food quality is the same every time.  The wait isn't longer than 10 minutes.  We did come on Valentine's Day, good thing I made a reservation.  We only have to wait about 10-15 minutes.  Otherwise I heard the wait time was an hr and 45 minutes.  Yuck!  I always order the California Club Pizza.  Husband tries different things.  The recent one was the Shrimp Scampi Pizza, sooo good!  A little spicy if you're not into that, you can ask them to make it less or without.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4
Branton J.,"Henderson, NV",56,90,94,2.0,10/30/2017,"I recently visited this CPK location on a Saturday night. We got there around 5pm with a party of 4 plus a high chair. We were told that the wait would be about 15 mins.  When about 15 minutes passed we were called. The Host tried to seat us at a table meant for 4. As we realized that it would be pretty tight, I noticed a number of tables which were empty. It amounted to a whole section which was closed as they ran a wait list. We asked for another table with more room and we were directed to wait again.  When we got our new table about 10 minutes after that we noticed that the section was still closed.  For an appetizer we ordered the white corn guacamole and chips. For dinner, we ordered the California Veggie Pizza and a Roasted Veggie Salad.  The guacamole came out right away. The portion was rather small and in my opinion lacked flavor. We added salt to it.  Dinner took a while to come out, in my opinion, longer than it should have. When it did we again found that the California Veggie Pizza lacked flavor and needed salt. I will say that the Roasted Veggie Salad was good.  With so many other restaurants in Town Square to chose from, CPK needs to step up their game.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4
Love G.,"Henderson, NV",78,55,64,4.0,6/8/2017,"First time coming to this location because I usually go to the one in Glendale, CA. The location is big, nice, and in a good location too.  Got half bbq chicken/pepperoni pizza and some spaghetti. That's what we usually always get, and I'm glad that it was still as yummy as the other location I go to.  Also got a red berry sangria with was good but had too much ice and tasted more like a juice more than anything.  Bathroom are also clean!

Merisenda A.,"Las Vegas, NV",185,152,213,5.0,6/5/2017,"I came out here to meet a friend. It was my first time at this location, and I must say I was blown away with the service. The server brought us some free cheesy flatbread with sage, she said it was for first time customers. Free food is always a nice surprise!  The service was pretty quick, too. The server was on top of her game. She came by often to check in on us and give us refills. I ordered the pepperoni pizza. It might be boring but it was tasty. For dessert, the salted caramel pudding is AMAZING. I highly recommend it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4
Sarah A.,"Southwest, Las Vegas, NV",130,141,274,4.0,3/23/2017,"Came here on a Tuesday night around 7/8. There were a couple of parties ahead of us. It was a 10-15 minute wait. I was honestly surprised that there was even a wait since it was a weekday.  Anyway, we were seated at a table that I felt like was way too big for 3 people. Lol there are plenty of good choices on the menu! I was stuck because I really wanted to order something fatty... but I knew I couldn't *insert crying emoji*. I settled for the chicken & veggies - sorry, I don't remember the exact name of the dish. My bf ordered the same thing & my friend had the pasta. We were given bread before our food came; it was hot & delicious! I like that they put herbs and I think chili flakes in the oil. The food came out maybe 15-20 mins later. The chicken & veggies were sooooo good. I was honestly surprised because I thought it would be bland. The portion was pretty big so I took half for my lunch the next day!  The service was okay, no complaints. She always made sure that our waters were filled but didn't really talk or ask questions much. Will definitely come back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4
Alexander M.,"Las Vegas, NV",405,1023,2308,4.0,8/10/2017,California Pizza Kitchen has always felt overrated to me but then again I guess it's because I don't like eating at places that don't keep it real about the ingredients that they use. That's a different review though let me give some credit where it is due! Specifically for this visit to the Town Square location my co worker invited me to a nice business lunch. We arrived and of course the place was packed because hello it's lunch time duh!  Talked to the hostess about the wait and was quayside maybe 15 minutes. 20 minutes later we were finally seated and I can't be made because hey it was only 5 minutes of a difference! I was looking for something light and not really in the mood for pizza but seriously who declines a free lunch? Not me!  Ahh but if course they have an extensive menu with alternate options so why not be open to a spinach And quinoa said with a nice piece of Salmon on top! Sounds good to me! I washed it down with one of the new refreshing cucumber mint drinks! Super yummy and out server made it an effort to not let my glass stay empty that was the best part! The full portion salad is huge and I really should've down the lunch size but whatever it was so worth it! The service here was amazing so I really have to come back again this time not for business so I can have a great cocktail! Great job CPK!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4
J B.,"North Bend, OR",0,39,23,1.0,1/13/2018,"Can't really give a fair review about the food cause we never got that far.  Checked with the hostess about a booth for two and was told a small wait please have a seat. After sitting down in the waiting area two separate couples also checked in after us.  Well one couple, who came in after us, was escorted to a booth. I thought perhaps they called in for reservations and no big deal. Then after an additional longer wait the second couple was escorted to a booth. I couldn't believe it so I went up to the hostess and asked what was going on?  She could only say she was sorry and it would be just a few minutes longer as they cleaned a booth.  I advised that I would like to speak with the manager after we get seated. The two of us was seated in a booth big enough to sit eight.  Unreal!  When the manager arrived I explained what occurred, and she was apologetic. I pointed out that families were waiting in the sitting area and we could not take this large booth while they waited as it wasn't right. I explained that we would just leave so she offered a rain check.  We refused the rain check and departed.  I can only say hospitality starts at the front door, and should extend throughout the establishment, but we didn't really feel it inside, and we do have choices where we wish to spend our money.  California Kitchen was one of our first choices but won't be a choice in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4

I had the Mac n cheese bites and they keep getting smaller each visit. Also enjoyed my pesto multi grain penne with chicken! The sun dried tomatoes are what MAKES this dish.  The salted caramel pudding is a definite each visit as well. That or the butter cake. Make sure you indulge in your dessert or walk next door to Godiva for some delicious chocolate ice cream!

Steph R.,"Las Vegas, NV",21,60,23,5.0,1/7/2017,"WOW, this was by far the BEST experience we have ever had at a CPK.  We usually have fairly good experiences at CPKs. The food is always good, the service is decent, we never really have too much to complain about but my gosh, this location really knows what they're doing.  As soon as we walked in, Jesse politely greeted us & thanked us for coming in to dine with them. I literally felt like I just showed up to his house for dinner, he was so nice. Turns out, he was the GM so that explained his great service. He probably services as an elite example for his staff. We were asked our seating preference and we chose a booth in the bar area.  Our server DeMond really made our experience even better. He was personable and prompt. When we ordered, we went with his suggestion. The Pesto Cream Penne Pasta had great flavor and it was a generous portion of food. We also ordered the California Club pizza & a Fresh Strawberry Mango Cooler. The California Club was a unique take on pizza. It came with Arugula tossed salad & fresh avocados on top. My fiancé literally joked, ""did you order a salad??"". While the presentation was intimidating, the blend of ingredients was genius. We enjoyed everything but what made our experience exemplary was the service we received tonight.

Sheilicha S.,"Whitney Ranch, Henderson, NV",1,13,,5.0,12/24/2017,"Visited California Pizza Kitchen for the first time since I've lived in Vegas. I Loved going here with my daughter, family, and friends when I lived on the East Coast. I took a friend, he really enjoyed his  being that he's Vegan. It's kinda hard to find good places that are good to eat and the ambiance is inviting. This was his first time ever eating here, and he to really enjoyed himself. Nicole our server was very pleasant and vibrant. Our hostess was also very hospitable. The General Manager, was very attentive to everyone's satisfaction of everything. When the couple came in with a Golden Retriever that's when things started looking like the stars were gonna change to a lower amount. But I know it was absolutely too cold for the dog to be left in the car. They could've also ordered or been recommended to order Take Out. It's a different time and a lot of people really don't respect how other's would see that a animal in a restaurant not being a service animal sitting on the booth seats would be kinda unsanitary and unorthodox. Overall I Love pets, and there human as well in my eyes. I'll definitely go here again.

The service at the pizza counter was not the best, I had two different servers asking me questions and checking on me but I never really knew who my server was... Whenever I asked for something, bread, balsamic, ranch, it always took a while for them to return with it. The food was DELICIOUS.

Many food selections, but I chose the basic Fettuccini Alfredo. Pasta was good, sauce was creamy. My friend ordered a chicken dish with mixed veggies.

We got sat down and we ordered our lunch I believe Juan was our server. We asked for ice water with lemon and he didn't bring it until we had to ask for it the second time. My friend ordered her pizza without red onions and he forgot to note that down because her pizza came out with red onions. I also ordered the Mediterranean salad with my meal but somehow it was Caesar so he had to switch it out. I also found a small piece of hair in my salad and took it out but I didn't complain about it. The pizzas we all ordered was really good. The appetizers plate that are set at each table before you sat down, one of them was dirty so we didn't use any of the plates that was already there. Our server probably only checked on us once throughout our whole meal. I would definitely recommend they work on better customer service. I gave this place 2 stars for lack of service we got but the food was delicious as it should be.

Jennifer T.,"Las Vegas, NV",593,553,729,4.0,12/5/2016,"I've been to this location twice now and the first time I was unimpressed by the service. I wanted a sample of their new sangrias because they looked delicious (but i'm super picky) and was told that its made to order which is new to me because I know that they always premake batches of it early in the day or whenever they run out. Anyway, during the first visit, our server didn't check back with us after we received our food, nor did he offer any water refills.  However, I came back today because it was a birthday celebration. Service tonight was great! Our server was attentive and waters were refilled without us asking. Food is amazing as always.  3/5  wild mushroom strozzapreti- I wasn't a huge fan of the pasta, it was on the harder side so if I were to order this dish again, I would probably sub penne or fusilli for it. I don't believe there was a sauce to it... maybe just olive oil or something but I did enjoy the variety of mushrooms (not that I could tell the different mushrooms apart). My friend said the dish was kind of on the bitter side, but I only had two bites and couldn't really tell nor mind it.  4/5 Kung pao spaghetti with chicken-  despite all the dried red chili peppers, its not spicy! Spaghetti noodles were cooked perfectly, however it was on the salty side and lacked some peanuts. I gave two of my gfs a bite and they loved it.  5/5 Bbq chicken salad with avocado- I've tried lazy dog's, BJs and a few other restaurants' bbq chopped salad and they don't seem to compare to CPK's. The full sized salad made for a good appetizer for the table (party of 6)  before our entrees came out. I was glad that it wasn't drenched in dressing unlike previous visits.  While I didn't try the halibut, two of my gfs ordered it and said it was kind of dry. They did enjoy the farro and said that the halibut was a nice size.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=20
Alice C.,"Las Vegas, NV",824,189,1604,5.0,7/23/2015,"I think the last time I went to a California Pizza Kitchen was at least 4 years ago in Michigan! Surprisingly I haven't gone to the one in Town Square, however, that changed today. One of my girlfriends wanted to catch up with a light lunch and recommended we go here. We shared the Tortilla Spring Rolls as an app - you can choose from 3 different kinds and we got the Mediterranean Veggie and the Thai Chicken (Baja Chicken is the third choice). Three small portions of each came out with a marinara sauce for the veggie and a sweet peanut sauce for the thai spring rolls. They were both pretty tasty and a great way to start our lunch.  I wanted a salad and went with the half portion of the Waldorf Chicken Salad and my friend got the half portion of the Moroccan Chicken Salad. The half portions are humongous and look like a full portion to me. Perfect size for lunch. My salad was incredibly delicious! Mixed greens with grapes, green apples, celery, chicken, candied walnuts, crumbled Gorgonzola, pre-tossed in a light vinaigrette. I wouldn't recommend getting this salad if you don't like Gorgonzola because as you know, it has a strong distinct taste and can be overpowering in any dish. I didn't mind at all because I LOVE cheese and Gorgonzola.  Katie was our server and she was fantastic! Very friendly and checked up on us quite often to make sure we were enjoying everything and to refill our drinks. I'm very satisfied with my lunch today and would gladly go back! Highly recommend California Pizza Kitchen if you're in Town Square and craving a fresh salad. I'll have to try their pizza next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=60

Leah J.,"Henderson, NV",0,7,3,1.0,11/6/2017,"So I just left CPK about 10 minutes ago and couldn't wait to write this review. I've been to this location as well as others and have never received the terrible service I received today. We waiting for 15 minutes for a table...not a problem! It was myself and my 4 kids on a lunch date. Once we got seated, rosabel took our drink order. It was 15 minutes before we got our drinks. When she brought our drinks, she took our food order. By now it was 1245pm.  We then waited another 20 minutes before Angie came and asked if we were ok and brought us bread. She said she understands how it can be with 4 kids so here's some bread to pass the time. First off, it's part of the service.  That was also the first time anyone came to check on our table since they took our order. We then waited for another 30 minutes before Angie came back and apologized for the wait and said she would have her manager come by to see what they could do for us since we waited for over an hour by this point. Shortly after her apology, the food came. We ate and at that point finally got our first refill on our drinks. Once we finished, Angie came back to see if we needed boxes and to bring the check.  The manager never came by like Angie said and the total bill for such service was over $50. Angie said she would be back to collect payment. We waiting another 10 minutes and finally I had my daughter walk it to her. Rosabel then brought it back and we walked out of the restaurant 2 hours after walking in. Definitely not the best experience and very reluctant to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=60
Tara J.,"Las Vegas, NV",26,101,40,4.0,11/13/2016,"After some exhaustive shopping, Mom, sister and I decided CPK sounded good and with the weather in Vegas being so fabulous (it's that 2 week window between being hot as an over and cold as a freezer), we decided we'd dine al fresco.  We were immediately seated and our wonderful server (who's name I regrettably didn't get) immediately took our drink and dinner order.  We started with a large Caesar salad to share and it was, well...ok. It wasn't like the CPK Caesar I remember. It just seemed lacking-the dressing was almost non-existent on parts of it. The croutons and Parmesan cheese were, however, delicious. On to the star of the show...the pizza. My mom and I ordered the roasted garlic chicken pizza. Onions, garlic, chicken, cheese...need I say more? I'm quite certain that our breath was kickin' afterward but it was worth it. So good. So, so, so good! My sister ordered the club pizza and she liked it but it wasn't that great as a leftover-mainly due to the avocados on it.

Ed V.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,4/2/2017,"I haven't written a Yelp review before, but unfortunately, my last two visits to this CPK have been so bad that I felt the need to post this review. The first time we went (1/21/17), we had an okay experience. The food was good overall, though there were a few things that were off: the bread was stale, our food came with toppings we specifically requested removed, and the raspberry iced tea was mostly too-sweet raspberry flavoring with a pinch of tea. The service was also a bit slow, but we enjoyed our time there. So, using a gift card I had been given, I tipped just under 10% -- leaving the balance exactly $11. Today (4/2/17) we went again, and it was a great expereience. The food, drinks and service were fantastic, and we were very happy during our time there. The problem came when we went to pay the bill. I still had my original receipt from my old gift card, which showed it should have had $11 left. However, when we went to pay, it the balance was only $8. I was shocked, and then, disturbed to realize that the server from our first experience--who turned out to be our same server today, Chad--had clearly tipped himself an extra $3 when he ran our card back in January. I didn't want to cause a scene and call him out--we had a fine time there today, after all--but that kind of behavior is inexcuseable. Since our server took the liberty of tipping himself extra last time, we left without leaving a tip. We love CPK-- but hate that our date was turned sour by staff's shady behavior. Safe to say, we sadly won't be returning to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=60

The worst part wasn't even that wait, while eating my salad, I found a cockroach in the plate!!! The assistant manager told me that it was unfortunate but a reality for places using ""fresh"" produce. I felt that it was highly unprofessional that he would suggest that, or suggest that we order anything off the menu, as the last thing I'd want to eat is anything from that kitchen. I asked for corporates number multiple times and he just kept restating that he'd give us his business card and we could contact him if we needed anything. (We never got the number for corporate.) In the end we left with two gift cards for 15$ that will basically get you 1 pepperoni pizza. Nice to know that my business and health is worth $15.

I guess we were the last table of his for the night, but we had to wait and wait for him to come out from the back to even get his attention. He gave off the vibe that he didn't want to be there and he was in a hurry because he wouldn't even let us answer his questions, he would just answer for us.

Not a good value for almost $6. Next came our entrees, the oriental chicken salad and Hawaiian BBQ chicken pizza. Once again, both dishes did not appear thoughtfully made. My salad contained iceberg lettuce, carrots, cabbage, and chicken the only substantial ingredient. The salad was exactly like a mix from the grocery store. The dressing was fine although a little heavy for the ingredients in the salad. My friend was also underwhelmed with her pizza. Her pizza was soaked in BBQ sauce, it was undercooked, and you could tell the quality of the mozzarella was low by the plastic like texture.

It would have been nicer if they could have seated all of us at one big table formed by many little ones, instead separating the whole family. ;( I ended up sitting with my dad and uncle, both who ordered fish tacos while I ordered the wild mushroom pizza. All which came with complimentary bread and oil. Let me cut to the chase: - WILD MUSHROOM PIZZA I was very disappointed after trying this pizza. The crust may have been perfectly soft, but for 13.99? I don't think so. It was not even that good. - FISH TACOS I stole one of my dad's fish taco's and thought they were bomb. The two avocado slices helped finish me off into oblivion. However, the tortilla and fish was a little to dry for me. - BREAD AND OIL All though these were complimentary, I actually enjoyed eating these more than the pizza and tacos. The bread might have been a little too hard on the outside, but it was so dam soft on the inside. Combined with the oil, I would have been fine just eating this instead of the main dishes!! - SERVICE I think something was wrong with our server.. She told me that my pizza will be out ""shortly"". I soon realized she said that 20 minutes ago. 20 minutes is not short!!!! My uncle also asked for a refill for his beer, which ended up taking 10 minutes to refill -_-. She didn't even apologize!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=100

Bonnie P.,"Henderson, NV",217,601,120,4.0,2/3/2013,"This has always been a favorite for us no matter where we've lived.  We don't go as often as we used to but came here because they sent us a coupon for a free dessert, lol, for my husband's birthday.  We usually get sat in a big, comfortable booth.  They have ""small bites"" appetizers and we tried the mediterranean focaccia bread.  It's really delicious but they don't give enough of the dipping oil, which would be my only complaint about it.   My husband is disappointed because they got rid of his favorite pizza, the bacon cheeseburger pie.  But he really loves their bolognese sauce and always enjoys his pasta dishes.   The waiter kept our glasses full all dinner long, which is something of a lost art in these parts, haha.  The dessert is the real kicker.  All of their desserts are purely gluttonous and amazing.  We've tried almost all of them but the hidden gem is the butter cake!  How could something so simple be so good?!?  And it's a thousand times better if you get it a la mode.  It's so soft and light it literally melts in your mouth.  Of course my other complaint is that I always leave here feeling like a cow because of how much I ate.  But at least I'm not going hungry!  If you haven't had this for a while I think you should definitely rediscover it because the service and the food are pretty awesome for a chain restaurant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=100

Approximately, 10-15 minutes later our food arrived.  My youngest older a BBQ chicken pizza which she  loves.

First of, there was a wait which was fine, however I saw two people came in after most of us but were seated before us, they were seated right away. I heard the host asked them ""Did you want to eat here?"" then seated them right away. I don't know what is the whole story with that but even another party looked around like ""Why are they getting a table right away?!""  After we were seated the server came up to us immediately and asked for our orders. Everything was find with drink orders and food orders. He told us about the new items and was friendly enough. Our apps came pretty quickly which was nice, when the main courses came, I picked up our empty appetizers plates with the intention of giving the dishes to the food runner because we had no space left on our table, she put the food down on the table and walked away in a rush when I know for a fact that she saw me holding the dirty plates! The plates were huge and the runner was standing right next to me, there was no way that she did not see I was holding the plates, but she just walked away without the picking up the dirty plates. So we stacked the dirty plates to one side ate with very little space, the server eventually came to take the plates away, did not ask us if we needed anything else or how the food was. He did not check in with us at all until it was time for the check.  I have been to this particular CPK a few times before and service was find, but this time it was strange. Maybe they got new employees and needed more training.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=40

Daniela H.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,24,17,3.0,7/5/2017,"Pizza taste is great, however could be pricey considering the fact that is pretty small. In my case I can eat more than a half pizza my self, cause is so thin. So if I have to order one by my self , plus salad or pasta and dessert it gets pricey for a non fancy restaurant. There's also better pizza places for lower price. We also tried their summer drink cucumber mojito (non-alcoholic) we didn't like it. The strawberry shortcake was good.  On the other hand, their service is very poor. There was no many people and our server was hard to get, every time we need him. He also never stop by to offer refills or find out if we need anything else, besides when he served our food. He took too long for serving and pizza was already cold by the time it reached our table.

Then I ordered the California veggie pizza and added avocado and pineapple to it. The avocado didn't come out with it, but the server brought it out on the side. It still looked amazing, however it lacked so much flavor. It tasted as though the veggies were frozen, thawed, and then baked on pizza left with no nutrient or flavor. Not even the red pepper flakes helped my case.

For dinner, my friend and I both shared the Wild Mushroom Pizza. If you are a mushroom lover, this pizza is def for you. Thin crust, wonderful cheese ratio and the meatiness from the different mushrooms really make this pizza.

When I inform her that I asked for bread, she has no reaction at all, and when I say the word ""that I specifically"" asked, she is taken back because she now knows that I know it was her who took my order and it was she who screwed up and tried to lie about it. These people need to be trained that a customer has an ""experience"" when they come to your business.  That experience begins finding parking, who greets them at the door, etc, etc. How likely am I to order take out again, knowing that the person who answers the phone doesn't pay attention, and doesn't care that she doesn't.

But we come here for the salads. Great portions for a great price. If you haven't had the roasted veggie salad with grilled chicken you are not living life!

Doriee D.,"Las Vegas, NV",252,348,1257,3.0,4/16/2014,"I've been coming to this CPK ever since it first opened, which was when Town Square first opened. Granted, I don't go THAT often but on and off -- usually with friends or family. I typically prefer this location over the one at Fashion Show Mall only because I hate venturing towards the direction of the strip. Not only that but this location is bigger.  However, I don't have a single memory of exceptional service from this establishment. Not once in the amount of odd years it's been around. In fact, I remember one time, when I went with friends, no one came to our table for a LONG while (not even for drink orders) so what did we do? Build a fort out of the menus. I know, we were so immature but funny thing was, that didn't get their attention.  I just recently came back to dine at this establishment with my family after being away from Las Vegas for three years, and I gotta say... the service certainly hasn't improved. I gotta admit, it's not as busy as it used to be, but it still took a LONG while for any server to acknowledge our existence after we got seated. There was nothing wrong with the hostess, but there was something wrong with the waitresses. I think it took so long that ANOTHER waitress that wasn't OUR waitress came to take our orders because no one else helped us. Which caused a little confusion later on when the food arrived.  Other than that, everything else went fine. After we got our food, we were happy campers.  Speaking of the food, it is pretty on point. It's pretty good. One of my favorite is their bolognese pasta. Sometimes I like to ask for them to make it spicy, in which they add pepper flakes to the pasta. Always turns out yummy. The garlic cream fettuccine is also another favorite of mine but sometimes, the flavor can be so-so. Oh, their tiramisu never disappoints either :)  Not a bad place. Not a fabulous place. Still great to eat at with family and friends when you want some CPK. Gotta have patience though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=120
Dennis T.,"North Las Vegas, NV",582,846,10004,4.0,6/12/2012,"After visiting The container Store for a longer span of time than we thought we would, it was high time for dinner.  Eyeballing the several offerings of Town Square, we came across this California Pizza Kitchen.  There was a wait everywhere on this Friday night, but here it didn't appear to be intolerable.  So, we put in our name and waited to be called.  After about 20 minutes the lights on our pager finally glowed red and danced about.  Now hungrier than ever, we prepared to settle in our comfortable booth and enjoy a multi-course dinner at a relaxed pace.  We were not ready to rumble, but to EAT! So, I began with Minced Chicken Lettuce Wraps, while Diane looked forward to an opening side of Traditional Crispy Mac 'N' Cheese.  The Lettuce Wraps were excellent, featuring fine chicken, tiny curved water chestnuts, jalapeno circles, very fresh and crisp lettuce leaves, and a nice soy-based spicy dipping sauce.  I did find though that the Cherry Limeade I also ordered was too strong for my taste. The Mac 'N' Cheese had an excellent crisp crust, and was firm on the inside--not mushy.  The whole dish was quite yummy. Unfortunately our Garlic Cream Fettuccine entrees then arrived right on top of our starters.  I sent mine back, but Diane accepted hers, which contained sauteed chicken and shrimp.  When my entree arrived again at a more suitable time, it was just like Diane's, except mine was further enhanced by sauteed mushrooms.  The sauteing was first-rate, the fettuccine was al dente, and just enough Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce clung to the pasta to make this a truly delectable dish.  The portions were large, with an ample amount of chicken breast chunks and medium- to large-sized shrimps.  We both enjoyed our hot entrees immensely. But how is a fine dinner truly complete without a sumptuous dessert?  So, I finished with a towering slice of 6-layer Lemon Cake with Lemon Custard Filling, while Diane dug into a large slice of 5-layer Red Velvet Cake.  My high-caloric sweet treat was brushed with Limoncello, candied lemon zest, and Mascarpone Frosting, and was very lemony and delicious.  Diane's was topped by a creamy and very tasty Cream Cheese Frosting.  We were both in dessert nirvana. One other service delay must be mentioned.  Diane seemed to wait forever for a Hot Chocolate.  We were ultimately told by both our server and the manager that the bartender on duty makes all Hot Chocolate drinks, and got behind making that and other ordered drinks.  Finally, the manager hustled over to our table with the Hot Chocolate way late, but did take it off the bill.  And then Diane found it to be too thin. Even though our dining experience was marred by two service errors, the food was so delicious that we just brushed these minor inconveniences aside, and this outing still rated an overall 4-1/2 stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=120

Candace A.,"Las Vegas, NV",18,6,,2.0,10/4/2016,"Normally. I have good experiences at California Pizza Kitchen, but the service experienced on 10/1 at this location was horrendous. Apparently, we had just missed a big rush since it was homecoming weekend for one of the high schools. We got there as the rush ended, and we're seated within 10 minutes.  Our server started out friendly and talkative at first. But as time progressed, the service went downhill. It took at least 15 min for us to get our appetizer, and then about 45 minutes to get our pizza. Not only that,  but the server never apologized for how long it was taking for our food to come out. I noticed another table of 5 (compared to our 2) had ordered the same appetizer, and received it quicker than we did. Hummus shouldn't take 15 minutes. Also, once we got the pizza,  the server made sure that it was not made with wheat since that's what I'm allergic to...however....I found it very odd that he said he made our pizza himself. Once we were ready for our check,  the process took another 10 to 15 minutes since we didn't know where our server was, and we had to ask someone else if we could have our check. Our server seemed to be in lala land. I used to be a server myself, and had the service been 20% better, the server probably would have received a better tip, and not $2, and I wouldn't be taking my business elsewhere due to the lack of customer service at this restaurant. I gave this place 2 stars because while the service was horrendous, the food was still good.

PIZZAS The Original BBQ Chicken (original hand tossed): I'm confident that I can eat this single-handedly. BBQ chicken + GOUDA CHEESE on pizza as a perfect combo and completely threw me off. It has just the right amount of sweet and savory flavors. Wild Mushroom (original hand tossed): I love mushrooms on my pizza, but this was practically bland. We didn't order the white truffle oil, which might've added that missing flavor factor. I'm not saying the pizza wasn't good, but it didn't stand out among the others.  Margherita (thin crust): Simple and delicious. I loved the cheesy, stringy Mozzarella, but I wasn't a fan of the crust. Despite that, the pie was a hit.  DESSERT Belgian Chocolate Souffle Cake: Warm, rich and fudgy, and it's served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!  SERVICE Great. Make reservations ahead of time. The place was busy during lunch, but our server and her team went above and beyond with taking care of my table's needs.

They warned us they were in construction and they were sorry the floors were tore up. It didn't bother us though, no construction was being done at that time!  On to the food! We ordered spinach and artichoke dip for appetizers and we finished it right before our food arrived. It's sad I was pleasantly surprised by this because half the time they come out with the food! The chips seemed a little stale but the dip was amazing, it wasn't chunky which I enjoyed better. We than shared mahi mahi tacos (with avocado $1.25 more) and a thin crust three meat pizza. The mahi mahi tacos were huge and very delicious, the avocado was also perfect! The pizza was a little spicy and we liked all the meat it had to offer!!

Looking around it was very clean and modern. Lots of seating.  Our server asked if we had ever been here before. We said no. I ordered a mojito and it was really good and refreshing. We both had a pizza each. My friend got the carnitas pizza sooo good! And I had the Hawaiian. It was good but too much green stuff on top. I think it was shredded green onion, not sure but I pulled most of it off. We had the Thai spring rolls (2) ok those were interesting in a good way. Loved the peanut dip that came with them. They were more of a taquito than a spring roll. Rolled up in a flower tortilla.  The manager visited our table prior to our food coming and after the bread olive oil arrived. She gave us one of the new flat breads. It was all cheese and some sage. It was interesting. Tasted like nachos for some reason. I can't stand sage. So it isn't something I would order. But it was free food so you know I ate it! With all the appetizers I was soooo full that I ate only two pieces of my pizza.

Our hostess was good about getting our drinks started right away. She answered all of our questions in a prompt and friendly manner. She was also really attentive about refilling our drinks. We ordered a pizza, half California Club, and half the Works. Please keep in mind that these pizzas are medium-sized, so you get 6 slices total. My husband had the Works: a take on supreme pizza. He liked it, but wasn't wowed by it. I had the California Club and I cannot express in words how good it was! It comes with bacon, cheese, romaine tossed in lemon pepper mayonnaise, and it is topped with avocado. The avocado and romaine were super fresh and the lemon pepper mayonnaise was the bomb! I liked it so much that as soon as I got home from the restaurant, I searched for a recipe for it with no avail, unfortunately. Hahaha.  Great service and good food.

I know that's part of the topping, but I've never seen them put so much. It really overpowered the pizza and made it soggy. The salad didn't have enough dressing and I paid extra for avocado which came with 4 tiny pieces. The soup was cold when it was served. Only good thing was the service, hence the 2 stars.

I feel this place is big enough to serve large families, but there are also more secluded places for a quiet meal.  There is the bar where all the action happens- tv and the oven can be your entertainment. Yes, CPK is a chain, but a great place at TS to stop in and know your children in the stroller are welcome and also it won't break the bank.  Service has always been eager and friendly to help you have a positive dining experience.  Don't forget they have to to go option as well.  I have yet to eat out on the patio,but that may be the place for a more quiet meal.  They do have some lighter menu items for the health conscious which is always good.

Micah O.,"Henderson, NV",1062,66,1485,3.0,3/1/2016,"Every time I come in here I ask myself why? As I'm looking at the menu I start thinking what other restaurants have better options. I usually try to avoid this restaurant unless it's the one in downtown summerlin. Well I had no choice this last time. I met up with some friends and they all voted for CPK. I tried to stay positive and go with the flow. We go in and are told it'll be at least twenty five minutes. Since there isn't much space to wait and we all had our kids, we decided to go to the Disney art store for a bit.         Once we returned we were automatically seated. The waitress seemed friendly and greeted us within a few minutes, but ordering food and drinks is where the problem came in. She took our drink order and after ten minutes they finally arrived (one alcoholic beverage and three waters). She then comes to take our order and we request if she'll return in one minute. Ten minutes later she returns again. So my friends all order pizza and I order the chicken tequila pasta. Close to 30 minutes later a server brings out the pizza and asked if I ordered anything. I told him I ordered the pasta and all of a sudden he looked really nervous. I was pretty hungry and trying not to over react (I take my food very seriously, it's not that hard to get an order right). The waitress came to us and admitted that my meal was sent to the wrong take and the person at the table already started eating it. She apologized and said she put another order in. When the my pasta came out she was genuinely apologetic. By the end of the meal, she said she took my meal of the tab. I really appreciate restaurants that make mistakes and own up to it, not just make a pathetic excuse and just say sorry. My problem is that this location always messes something up when I come in. Maybe I have a stamp on my head that says ""mess up his order"" or maybe their job is really that hard? The one think I do know, I'll probably not be returning to this location.

Service was quite slow, as took quite a while to get the drinks out, and we had to find the server to get refills.  The pizza had very little taste.  Not sure if the crust was overcooked, or just little taste.  Pizza also took forever to come out.  Considering the premium price of their pizzas, I just can't see returning unless we start hearing some positives.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=80

Their Townsquare location is the main one I visit since it's the closest to home and since Townsquare always has a nice feel with all the trees and everything. Let's start with service, sometimes it's a hit or miss with the servers but generally pretty good. One thing that they're really good at is keeping wait times low even though it gets crazy. Onto the food! I've loved everything I've tried here except for their Jambalaya Pasta. That dish scarred me Lol idk if they made it wrong or something but that just had a horrible flavor. I had my boyfriend taste it too and he said it was pretty bad Lol. But thankfully that's the only bad thing I've had. My current favorites are the Avocado Club Eggrolls, Cedar Plank Salmon, Tequila Fettucine, Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pizza & Pear/Gorgonzola Pizza on Hand-Tossed Crust. I'm not a fan of thin crust at all so I'm happy that they can make any of the thin-crust pizzas on regular hand-tossed. Now their Butter Cake with Haagen Daaz ice cream deserves it's own paragraph. Oh my Goodness. I remember the first time being introduced to it, We wanted a dessert but didn't know which one to go with and our waitress was like, ""You're not true CPK Fans till you've given our Butter Cake a try."" This cake is life changing lmao. Super warm and soft and sweet but not too sweet. It's a little hard to describe the flavors but whatever you do, just get it. I've also ordered to-go many times and everytime, the pizza, salads, etc were all the same quality as you would get dining there.

They now have a 'low calorie' menu, it's definitely more pricey than their other menu, but sometimes you have to pay not to be tempted.  You can go online and download a full and comprehensive caloric menu from their website.  For instance, ordering the pizza thin crust makes a pretty big difference. Our server was very bubbly and attentive, she was their corporate trainer based on the pin on her lapel, dark hair really cute glasses.  They have 1/2 salads and full portions too, which is nice. I ordered the under 500 calorie shrimp scampi zucchini pasta--I loved it. Especially for being healthy. It had tons of garlic and a lot of flavor. I added spinach and roasted red peppers to it for some more veggies. I'm going to try and replicate it at home. It was very very good. My friend ordered lettuce wraps [chicken and shrimp which somehow has more calories & fat than just the chicken or just the shrimp? which is confusing but whatever] she ate 'em up. Her husband ordered a 1/2 salad which he finished in it's entirety and then managed to eat a couple of her lettuce wraps. Food took a little longer than I would've liked to come out, but it was very busy. Would also love if they served some pizza bread for a starter [even though that is not on the diet].  1/2 salad & 1/2 pizza option would be very nice too. Music was very loungey this time I felt like I was in a nightclub, kind of techno funky was unusual but I didn't mind it.

I rate food based on whether or not I can make it better at home. I couldn't have done better, so good job CPK.

He constantly kept our waters filled and our bread coming. The free bread they give there with a side of butter and dipping oil they serve is so good he served us three rounds!

I hadn't been to CPK in forever and the only location I've ever been to is the one at Fashion Show. We arrived at 3:30 and surprisingly the place was full and there was a 15 minute wait.   This place reminded me of Chuckie Cheese with all the kids everywhere. LOL I much prefer the atmosphere at the Fashion Show location. Everything here just seemed kind of cheap even the napkins... & I swear I remember the food tasting much better. -Mango Sangria: Reminded me of Mexican candy which I happen to like haha but there were only 3 pieces of fruit in there and I couldn't even taste any wine/alcohol..  -Grilled Peaches & Shrimp Salad: Loved this salad!!! Tangy dressing and fresh field greens.. Shrimp were small though.  -Wild mushroom Pizza with chicken: This used to me my favorite pizza. I feel like there used to be more mushrooms with stronger flavors. The crust used to be perfect and kind of sweet. -Jambalaya Pasta: It was too spicy/peppery for me. I prefer Cheesecake Factory's version..  -Complimentary bread: Wasn't even warm & the butter was ice cold.   Service was friendly. I just think with so many other options at TS.. California Pizza Kitchen doesn't stand out. & if I really wanted their pizza I could get it in the frozen aisle at the grocery store.

Our server, Rachel (from Maryland by way of Austin), was overly friendly. She was so bubbly, it was almost exhausting. At her suggestion, I ended up getting a Kiwi Frozen Lemonade with a shot of Absolut. Excellent suggestion. It was very good! By the way, their White Sangria is also delicious. I didn't plan on eating, but CPK has such a wide selection of salads, I couldn't resist getting their Moroccan Chicken Salad. I should have gone with a half because that thing was huge!

We also got the peach salad and I just really didn't like it because of the cottage cheese and raisins. But the complimentary bread we got was great.

Shannon S.,"Henderson, NV",178,146,44,3.0,7/20/2014,"I've been to a lot of different pizza kitchens across America and honestly I have to say that this was the last place to try on my list. Now I definitely regret even putting this on my to do list, or my ""tackle the yummy"" list. It's a typical Sunday in Las Vegas, hot and windy. I Mountaintown Square on Las Vegas Blvd. and I'm hungry. So of course I would love to go try something new. Hence California pizza kitchen. So my mother arrives we decide to go in and try it.  All I can say is disappointing! The food lackluster and locked flavor. The presentation was less than heart. And the prices were outrageous. Not to mention their major competitor is Sammy's woodfired pizza. Sammy is offers gluten-free variations of pastas and crusts to appeal to a wider variety of people. To my surprise California pizza kitchen only has five pizzas that you can get the gluten-free crust and has absolutely no other gluten-free menu and no gluten-free pasta. Being a celiac this was disappointing!  Now let's talk about the service. The gentleman seated us was very nice and the weather was nice but completely uneducated in anything that has to do with any aspect of anything Culinary. When I inquired about if they had pasta that was made without me because my son had a dairy allergy he replied ""well the only pasta with diary is going to be our fettuccine Alfredo or mac & cheese.""obviously I know that Alfredo and macaroni and cheese obviously has ""cheese"" and has Dairy. So why would I order that for my son? Wouldn't. Again I stated ""no, my son has all dairy allergies including eggs. So again that your pasta have eggs?"" He quickly ran to go check and came back and stated that all their pasta egg. Again very disappointing. All in all besides the lack of a gluten-free menu, the lack of ambience, the lack of an educated staff, and the outrageous prices, the food  was lack luster and was not visually appealing. Tasteless food never is a recipe for success. Maybe there other restaurants have better chefs? Maybe that's how they got so big? I'm not sure, however I am not on the California pizza kitchen bandwagon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=160

Foodie F.,"Anthem, Las Vegas, NV",1,37,16,4.0,6/14/2015,"I love CPK! I came to the one over at Town Square for a quick lunch with some friends. I love how the menu offers small plates and meals on the lighter side. I ordered my food from the small plates section. I had my own asparagus and arugula salad and split the Bianco flatbread with my friend.   The arugula salad was perfectly light and not drenched in dressing like some salads are. It was a complete balance of bitterness from the arugula and sweetness from the fire roasted tomatoes. The cheese was sliced so thin that you could see through it, so it also gave the salad a nice savory touch. The Bianco flatbread was stunningly delicious. It was brushed with a thin layer of truffle oil and garnished with a little bit of greens and covered in mozzarella cheese. Within every bite was a whiff of truffle oil. It was a definite five stars overall for the food. I knocked off a star from my rating of CPK because our waitress seemed to be new at her job. She was nervous while taking our order, but she was kind and quick enough to serve us complimentary bread with oil (which wasn't the best bread I've ever indulged on).  However, when we were finished with our food, she came to get our plates, and because she seemed nervous, she accidentally dropped one of our plates on the table and broke it. We knew it was an accident, but I saw the manager standing close by looking at us, and she didn't do anything about it. However, my experience was wonderful at CPK minus the part where the service was a little lacking in confidence and management.

Alyson B.,"Spring Valley, Las Vegas, NV",4,29,13,5.0,5/27/2015,"Came here for a quick dinner after picking up a friend from the airport. I ordered the grilled veggie sandwich with choice of regular or herb ciabatta, and soup or Caesar salad. I did the herb ciabatta and asked if I could do a house salad with ranch instead, and our waiter said it was fine. My friend ordered a Blue Moon and the traditional crust white pizza.  My sandwich was really good, loved the aioli. I'm a vegetarian and veggie sandwiches are usually a hit or miss for me. This one was tasty and fresh.  It came with a Caesar salad despite my asking for a house salad, but I didn't mind because it tasted fine.  My friend loved his white pizza.  Waiter took a while to grab the check, but someone who looked like a manager came over and grabbed it. He was super nice and apologized for the wait.

Alex M.,"Spring Valley, Las Vegas, NV",50,12,13,5.0,12/8/2013,"This CPK located in the center of Town Square mall is like any other CPK. Not to say it is bad but a very typical solid experience you get at any national chain restraunt. My review is of their new gulten free menu. It is awesome! They have for pizzas to chose from: BBQ chicken, pepperoni, margherita, and mushroom pepperoni sausage. Right when you you walk and ask the hostess for a gf menu they know what you are talking about, which is nice. The waiters are also well trained and very familiar with the gluten free options. When ever you order gluten free the manager comes over and explains their process of avoiding cross contamination and then hand delivers the pizza to you. The pizza are delicious and high quality. They use a different  gluten free crust, it is about 14 inches in diameter and tastes just like a regular thin crust pizza, or so my girlfriend  says. Keep it up CPK!

I informed Brad the Manger of the place that I am pregnant, and he did not feel any need to follow up with a client that he potentially made ill. Congratulations on your filthy establishment and terrible customer service.  The photo and story have already hit social media, as we do not want you to harm anyone else.

I ordered the four cheese ravioli even though it was a bit more than I wanted to spend (like 14 bucks I believe).  It was pretty ""meh."" It really wasn't that cheesy, and for four cheeses being in there, I would have thought there would be more flavor.

Kristal R.,"Las Vegas, NV",127,42,5,3.0,10/11/2011,"Something was wrong. California Pizza Kitchen is my FAVORITE restaurant.   We've been here a million times, and the service and food quality was always CONSISTENTLY EXCEPTIONAL.   Not this time.   We walked in, sat down and were so thrilled and happy because my fiance and I had just gotten engaged.  Don't get me wrong- I don't put a price tag on food, so we could have chosen to eat anywhere fancy shmancy to celebrate our recent engagement. But what did lil' ol' me want to do??  I wanted a damn pizza from CPK!  Why? Because it was a refeed day from weeks of lifting and underfeeding (fitness/training talk) and like I said- it's my favorite restaurant, and I am ALWAYS happy when I go to and leave any CPK. Our waiter walked over with a quietly foul, non-chalant, I don't give a sh*t attitude.  Totally killed our mood, but hey- I was okay with it because I just wanted my pizza.  Thai Pizza to be exact.  Edgar ordered fried mac & cheese, and I ordered hummus.  Pita was dry and lacked texture.  Mac & Cheese was dry.  Bleh. My pizza was abysmal.  I've ordered this pizza dozens of times, and I was so disappointed.  But oh well, it is what it is. It was dry and lacked that peanuty flavor that it normally has.  It was just...just.  That's it.  Nothing more to it.  And Edgar's Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Pizza was thin.  We didn't order thin.  I would give this visit a darn 1, but I'll leave it at 3 because I really do love the restaurant chain.  And if you know me-- I don't take to chains too much.   We'll definitely be back because I know it was an anamoly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=220

We were seated very quickly but after that it took forever for everything.  It took a while for the waitress (Ariel) to come take our drink order, but thankfully once we ordered them it didn't take too long for them to come out. We ordered the avocado egg rolls as an appetizer. They are normally very good, but this time they were barely warm. The food runner who brought them out actually stopped in the middle of the restaurant to text for a minute and then brought our egg rolls. Extremely unprofessional. I was a little irked that our waitress offered all her other tables bread, but not ours. Since we had ordered an appetizer I wasn't too upset, but the inconsistency in the service was irritating. I order pasta for my daughter, which was also barely warm by the time we got it. The barbecue chicken salad we got was pretty good, but the chicken was dry. And then it took forever to get our check. Apparently texting and talking to other waiters was more important to our waitress than attending to her tables. I understand it was a slow time in the restaurant (a Tuesday around 4 pm) but still try to be somewhat attentive.

Nadia L.,"Las Vegas, NV",57,75,125,1.0,11/23/2015,"I visited the newly remodeled Town Square location on Saturday (11/21) around 11:45am. We asked to sit outside because it was a nice cool afternoon. They sat us and from that point on it was as if we didn't exist. I order what I've been ordering for the last 15 years, the full size BBQ chicken salad. Since I always order that, I know what the portion is supposed to look like. The price has increased and the salad has shrunk. The full size is now comparable to what the half size used to be. I was very disappointed. How do you justify higher price for less food? When they dropped off my salad I asked the guy for a side of ranch. He said ""sure"" and that was the last I saw of him. I sat there for 15 minutes waiting for someone to come check on me outside so I can ask again. Finally, I had to leave my table and go inside the restaurant to ask a random cashier to get me a side of ranch. By this time, my salad was old, undersized, and just tasted wrong. Perhaps the whole experience is what put a bad taste in my mouth, but I couldn't eat more than one bite. Flagging down a waitress to address my issue was the ongoing challenge of the day (it wasn't busy). My friend that was dining with me literally stood up and waived her arms in the air from side to side to get someone's attention. That didn't work either. She was frustrated for me, and this was holding us up because she was already done eating. She went inside the restaurant and grabbed what seemed to be the manager. I didn't go into all of my issues because I didn't have the patience. I told them the salad that I always get didn't taste right and I just want them to prepare me the Garlic Cream Fettuccine and pack it TO GO since this has been a long drawn out ordeal. I felt like the manager was trying to upsell when he tried to push the grilled chicken option on me. I said ""my chicken experience hasn't been good today so I'll pass"". He pushed it on me more and I agreed to it just to get it done. I was told the salad would be taken off my bill. I thought to myself ""that's a given, the salad wasn't made well, basically untouched and I'm sending it back""... When I got the bill, they offered no discount for my inconvenience, no free dessert, nothing. I'm just very put off by this experience. I hate that I'm going to have to stop coming to a place that I so often visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=200

Morgan E.,"Scottsdale, AZ",69,155,23,5.0,5/10/2013,"love. love. love. I had a stressful interview on the strip and wanted to get some lunch, so I stopped at a place I know in Town Center- CPK. I sat at the bar, and had the greatest server. He needed a shoutout. I asked him for suggestions on the menu, he had options for me, and suggested two salads, and something that caught my eye- the Spinach & Artichoke Pizza. We discussed in length the difference between that pizza and the classic BBQ Chicken. Well, His suggestions were great, didn't try to oversell me and cracked me up the entire time I was there.  The manager was near the bar area and was extremely involved in the kitchen as well as his serving staff, which was really nice to see.

The pizza at cpk is about the same quality as some of the other high end chains. The problem here was the service. Unfortunately, our pizza s came out wrong (I had the BBQ chicken with no cheese and hubby the meat cravers, regular.) they reversed the order and his got no cheese. After we flagged down the server, sge apologized and sent them back. Unfortunately, again, she could not keep our drinks full. At one point, I waited so long for a refill, my pizza got cold waiting for a drink. Hubby had to eat  the second half of pizza with nothing to wash it down.

James S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,3/21/2016,"I have eaten at this place 3 times. The first time was great, the second was not good at all. We went back for a 3rd time because we wanted to give it one last chance. Unfortunately when we got there we were told there was no bread to be served, understandable on a busy Saturday night. However it's what took place after that really sealed the deal on whether or not we would return. The waitress brought me a Dr. Pepper that she later admitted she knew was watered down and after she dropped it off with our food, she didn't return for 15 minutes. So, I went my entire meal without a drink. When she returned, which only happened after I requested for the manager, she said she knew it was watered down but served it anyway instead of changing the soda in the back. She made us wait continuously throughout the night for refills, desert and even for our check. I don't complain often, but the icing on the cake was when she brought our check after us waiting for another 10 minutes for it she circled where the tip chart was on the bottom and she made it seem as if we wouldn't have tipped If she hadn't. This was all at 9 o'clock at night when there was maybe 3 tables in her area. The manager was helpful, but I'm not one to complain in store when I have to keep the waiter. The food was good, but such slow service I wouldn't likely return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=200
Renee P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,97,,4.0,7/30/2014,"While I have eaten at this location and it is fine (yes, kind of loud and lots of kids), my review is for CPK in general.  I agree it is a little pricey for what you get, so we only go very infrequently.   One of my biggest peeves is restaurants that do not have a cravable dish. Well, I love, love, love the waldorf chicken salad and the chicken tostada pizza (with the original crust, they changed it to flat bread, do not order it this way).  As for cpk in general, they can very few and far between have the chain syndrome of off food or staffing, their soda (also like many chains places is horrible) and their ""free"" bread, that oddly is only served sometimes, is also dry and tasteless, so I am glad that more than not it is not presented because i love bread and don't want to bother eating it.   We have rarely gotten other menu items, when with larger groups we order other random ones and enjoy them....the blt, the buffalo chicken (I think this is gone too) come to mind.  They took my husbands favorite of the sweet sausage and onion off the menu.  That also seems to be a problem for chains....when something works don't change it.....put the tostada pizza back on the original crust or people might not know how good it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=200

It's weird how we took  it for granted until we started frequenting the CPK at Town Square. The CPK at Town Square has inferior service.

Jessica R.,"Las Vegas, NV",191,154,392,3.0,4/9/2011,"Dined here with my boyfriend for a late breakfast/early lunch while on this side of town running errands. The ambience inside the restaurant is really pleasant with lots of spacious windows filling the place with sunlight and the woodfire oven mirroring it with bright yellow tile. It's a very pretty space to dine in and the grand windows allow you ample people watching of all the hipsters ambling by.  The restaurant was packed while we were there, so service was a little slow. I had a cup of coffee that was a little stale, but the refill was much better. The coffee wasn't bitter and seemed like more of a light roast. I like that the cream comes in a small glass! Be aware that any of the espresso based drinks run about the same as Starbucks prices. They seemed to have a decent selection of beers but it was too early for me to dwell on them long. We started with their minestrone soup, which was thick with different ingredients but wasn't mindblowingly amazing. I've had a richer depth of flavor in homemade versions, but it was a decent restaurant adaptation.  The salad we sampled had arugula, asparagus, parmesan, almonds and a few other simple toppings. It was a light starter on a long rectangular plate that made it easy to share between the two of us.  We had their vegetarian pizza with japanese eggplant and it was nice but fairly small. You would definitely need two pizzas if you were with a group of three or more very hungry people. Since we had shared a salad and a soup prior to having the pizza, it was a good amount of food to sustain us through ""brunch""-time with two slices left over to provide a light meal for my boyfriend later in the day.  The pizza had a thin crust with a nice chewiness to it and the toppings were well chosen for the pizza but a little sparsely placed. There were large pieces of broccolini/broccoli rabe/baby broccoli that were hard for me to bite through and interrupted the otherwise lovely texture medley. I don't recall the eggplant standing out, which was a little disappointing but it may have just been covered in cheese.  Next time we venture over to this area there's a good chance we'll return to sample some of their other pizzas with some friends so we can have a better sampler of their offerings!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=240
Tien N.,"Las Vegas, NV",25,307,26,4.0,8/9/2010,"I'm not one to write reviews for larger chains mainly because if you've eaten at one it's very likely the other chain in the other part of town isnt much different.  Other reviews for this CPK are a tad old so now would be a great time for a refresher review. Due to it's location at Towne Center the place is kinda packed with local shoppers and tourists alike, being crowded means being noisy, servers do tend to rush to get finished customers out and new customers in to keep the business moving. This is nothing new and should not count toward their overall score unless they stand there staring at you arms cross tapping their foot in a gesture that clearly says 'order desert or GTFO' I completely agree with Ken O's observation that some of the menu items are a tad on the expensive side and are a bit too exotic. The chain seems to focus on a shot gun spread approach instead of specializing.  After over two years going to continue on Audrey W's review and report that the BBQ Chicken Pizza is still light on the sauce but still tasted pretty good.  Lettuce wraps were pretty awesome but they need to use fresher shrimp. The texture of the diced up frozen stuff they use is too mushy and it doesn't stand out among the other ingredients. Same goes with their water chestnuts as well, out of the entire entree i can only recall biting into something crisp that wasn't lettuce maybe three times. Buddy got the standard 'oldie but goodie' pepperoni pizza. The pie was a bit greasy but a pepperoni pizza not having a noticeable layer of shine on top is like a zebra not having black and white stripes. One thing i did notice was the taste of the areas that didnt contain pepperoni. They were like black holes sucked away all the flavor and experience to leave you plain and unsatisfied.  From reading past almost year old reviews i can say the service has improved. There's a manager on the floor helping out the servers and ensuring quality control and getting feedback. Our own server was like a hawk...with video cameras...and a surveillance van commonly seen in police films and movies. If i were to give him a motto for the day it would have to be ""leave no glass empty"" seriously he swapped out our drinks when we had only a quarter left and during that time between debating if one should get the bill and call it or order a dessert and dread the gym the next day he still refilled our drinks.

When we asked for bread, she only gave us 3 pieces and we were four people while we saw a group of 2 get 5-6 pieces of breads. While we had our food she didn't come to see how the food was. While we were eating she just dropped down the bill  like she wanted us out in a hurry. My mother was eating her Cobb salad and the bacon was cold and raw. My father ordered a vegetarian pizza and asked for goat cheese and when the pizza came it had no goat cheese and on the bill they charged us extra for goat cheese. The pizza I ordered was a barbecue chicken and it was good. But like I said she rushed us out. When we were eating she came up to us and asked us for dessert. While my family was of course still eating. She deserved no tip at all. I would recommend while in Las Vegas. Don't go this California pizza kitchen.

This other hostess took the car seat out of my friends hands and basically wedged it between the table and the back of the booth. Ummmm... Not safe.

Now, I visit for the first time in over 8 years. I went to the location at Town Square. After a 40 minute wait, we were seated.  I didn't mind the wait since we bought an iMac from the Apple Store while waiting.  I also had enough time to shop at The Container Store.  Okay, maybe the wait was more than 40 minutes.  We were seated in a nice booth.  We had an opportunity to look at the menu and were greated by a waitress that was quiry to say the least. She had a quite intensity. I dare not upset her. I was extra nice to her and she seemed to respomd well to the nice gesture. When my buddy's gf wasn't paying much attention, the server became aggitated.  I felt then need to apologize for the gf's lack of attention. Anyways, the meal was good.  The toppings were thick.  The only was that the server disappeared for long periods.  Our drinks ran empty three times and nobody was to be found. She also took a long time to bring and process the check.  The whole process from start to finish took two hours. We only ordered two pizzas and some drinks.  My friend did not like his Bloody Mary. I had strawberry tea, which was good.   Normally, I would be unhappy about the long wait and the even longer service, but at least I had already accomplished my shopping and we weren't late for the movie we came to see.  Maybe we saved money since the girls didn't have time to shop.

On top of that, they didn't have the AC on and it was so hot and stuffy in the restaurant that everyone I ate with was uncomfortable and sneezing. After we complained, they turned the AC on and it got much better. I was just really surprised no one else in the restaurant complained.

Bill came to 27 dollars and change. They told me to the food would be ready at 5, I had ordered around 4:45 pm. I got there at 5:10 because I parked in the wrong lot. The pizza was in the oven ready. I couldnt believe it when he pulled it out. It was a bar pie - I was expecting something a bit larger. He brought the spinach dip over and put both in a bag and said I had to wait on the bread. A full ten minuted later he brought the bread over - he should have at least left the pizza in the pizza warmer  while I wait, at least it would have been warm when I got home. The pizza was nothing special - it was ok , the spinach dip was excellent and the pita (the only thing that actually was still warm when I got home) was good as well. I didn't like the price, I expected leftovers for $27 I made quick work of the pizza ,dip and bread and was still a little hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=260
Robert C.,"Las Vegas, NV",150,53,20,3.0,8/5/2011,Service here is usually great.  But i donno the food doesnt really sell me on anything super duper spectacular.  It's a nice place to hit if you have pizza fans with you at town square.  But personally i'd rather go down the street to claim jumper or yardhouse.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=260
Majid S.,"Las Vegas, NV",11,5,,5.0,10/10/2010,"I was in Town Square last month and decided to try this place while I was out with family.  It's a pretty big restaurant with a welcoming environment.  The host was very nice.. and we only had to wait about 8 minutes to be seated.  This place is pretty busy and I soon found out why.  They have comfortable booths with outside seating as well.  I had the Thai Chicken pizza (1st visit) and the Four Seasons Vegetarian pizza (2nd visit).  The portion was generous and if I remember correctly I paid $12.  The waiters and waitresses where very courteous and they made sure we were tooken care of.  A few weeks ago I noticed that they also have frozen pizza in the frozen food section at stores.  I bought a couple for me and my daughter and they were ""almost"" as good as the actual restaurant but still very good.  CPK is a great restaurant with great staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=260
Patrick H.,"Henderson, NV",84,159,107,2.0,6/1/2011,"I've been to CPK a few times and I really don't think there's anything that great about it.  My wife likes it so we go but I'm never very excited about their pizzas or food.  I think it is a little pricey for what you are getting.  I can eat one of their pizzas by myself and still be hungry and then I'm out $12.  On the flip side, there really isn't anything wrong with it.  The service is always fine and their food tastes good.  I would just rather go somewhere like Settebello but when you have a pregant wife, what are you gonna do?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=260
Mike H.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,4.0,1/23/2014,Great place to eat! Food is quick and friendly staff. Only had one bad experience here but they ended up   our meals and gave us two free entrees with drinks for later.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=260
Ramze S.,"Henderson, NV",97,87,4,3.0,3/4/2011,"Generic CPK. Love the white pizza. This location is always packed and a little slow on service. If they can just get that kicked up a notch, I would probably frequent them more often. They also train their servers to do a huge pet peeve of mine. They ask young children in my group what they want to drink directly, even suggesting things like chocolate milk. I hate that. I will make those decisions and I don't need them instigating it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=260
Don I.,"Montreal, Canada",0,25,,3.0,9/13/2013,Ate the white pizza and it was not bad.   I can't say it's better than Grimaldi's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=260
Izra H.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,15,,4.0,3/15/2013,"CPK is one of my favorite restaurants at Town Square, and I do prefer this location among all. I have tried almost every pizza they have, but my absolute favorite has to be chicken chipotle, it's the best, I usually don't like most of its ingredients, but I do like it on this pizza for sure, a little spicy but definitely tasty. Their salads are good too, soups are worth mentioning as well, and lastly the dessert is rich. Overall great servers and hosts. Amazing restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=260
Luis P.,"Las Vegas, NV",100,75,264,4.0,2/13/2012,"I've been a CPK fan ever since they were a small pizza franchise in the early days. CPK serves quality pizza and pastas with fresh ingredients, and good service. And now, despite growing in size and location, CPK has stayed mostly true to it's roots, keeping their food quality unchanged and the service above and beyond the norm. This is the first time me and the wife has tried CPK at this busy location (Town Square), one because it was always crowded, and two because being a tourist-centric location we feared it might take a toll on the quality of the food and service. We were delightfully proven wrong however, our server was friendly, attentive and prompt, our meal (Wild Mushroom Pizza and Chicken Piccata) arrived in a timely manner and tasted just how it was -- very good. We left fairly satisfied and happy knowing that CPK has achieved what most restaurant food chains have failed in growth: maintaining what you loved about them at the beginning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=260
Emmagelle B.,"Henderson, NV",243,96,256,4.0,7/29/2011,"i always order the same things when i ever i go here. i love the zesty limeness of the chicken tequila fettuccine. the sauce is not too think or slimy. the peppers add the crunch to the plate. but watch out for their chicken portions. my friend ordered the same thing, and i got less chicken than he did. overall taste zesty, because i squeeze more lime on to the pasta :) i've also had a bite of korean bbq steak tacos. eh? i've had better taco's like from jay's jay in CA. the kbs tacos were too juicy and the bbq threw it all off. white corn guac and chips is also under the small cravings menu, when they mean small, they mean small. i personally am use to eating guacamole alone. so for me, i didn't like the corn edition. oh and i've tried their infamous bbq chicken pizza. but cmon! you can get it frozen at a grocery store, and it'll taste the exact same as the restaurant!! that is why i opt in getting the chicken tequila fettuccine from now on! overall, environment is chill. and is definitely a family restaurant, especially how busy they get. as far as their staff, i've had mixed experiences, just gotta get them on a good lucky day to encounter their overly extra friendly staff or the ones that are just waiting to clock out..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=260
Audrey W.,"Oakland, CA",78,109,19,3.0,2/1/2008,"This California Pizza Kitchen, located in the newest shopping center on Las Vegas Blvd S, Towne Center. The service was quick and efficient, the waiter was attentive. The only problems I had with this location was, that my meal felt rushed because the waiter was not only attentive but it seemed like he was trained to ""turnover"" his tables quickly. I had the Barbeque Chicken Pizza which was good, but they were light on the barbeque sauce. Also I had a Raspberry Mojito that was very watery, and my dessert was just average. Overall, this restaurant has potential if they just slow down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-4?start=260
