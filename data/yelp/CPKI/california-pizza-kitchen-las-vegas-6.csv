S R.,"Folsom, CA",3,118,266,4.0,1/11/2018,GOOD AIRPORT FOOD. Unlike others that heat precooked meals -  This place actually cooks their food at the airport.  * Meditteranean omellete breakfast -  excellent. * Vegetarian spinach mushroom pizza - excellent * Caesar salad - excellent LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.

Corey W.,"Honolulu, HI",71,227,46,2.0,1/14/2018,"I generally like the California pizza kitchen they have decent food. The menu here is considerably smaller than a normal location. That was kind of disappointing. The real hit was the wait service. The waitress meant well but she really needs to be fired. Competence was a serious issue. Order was messed up. Of the three entrees we ordered (and the waitress wrote down on a notepad) only one of them made it to our table. The other was forgotten. When we mentioned it to the waitress she looked at her notepad and realized she had not properly put in our order. Additionally, while it was busy she moved very slow, had difficulty keeping up, and at a few points (like when we needed to request our check to get to our gate for our flight) was hard to find.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-6

I fly a lot and also own a store in the airport.   I ordered a pizza to go, Had an emergency call to make that last almost 40 min. I came  back to the restaurant to pick up the pizza and asked them to heat for me, As I never opened it and never picked it up, And they said no. We are not allowed. Why don't you offer a new one then? Because it's my fault? What a good service you offer ? This restaurant is managed by the Hudson group who manage the restaurant in this airport.

I know there are other airport options but I have a thing about carrying my food to a table along with luggage. Something tragic will happen, I know it. So as for a sit down restaurant (besides Ruby's) in this terminal, this is it folks! I have always ordered the egg breakfast with toast, potatoes, sausage but I opt for egg whites instead. I am a Creature of habit. There is not much you can really do to mess up a breakfast like this or make it phenomenal since it is airport food.

Gigi A.,"Manhattan, NY",127,821,4836,2.0,11/6/2017,"If you have to eat breakfast in this airport, this is more in the side of more reasonably priced, and I mean that relative to the airport. Three eggs, toast, bacon OR sausage and potatoes OR fruit will run you $9.79. It's not as ridiculously expensive as the airport could be. Same deal can be for two eggs ($9.29) or 1 egg ($8.79). I got three, fruit and I asked for potatoes instead of meat, which they accommodated.  The coffee, which I really needed after 5 days in Vegas, was terrible. It tasted like cigarette ashes. My mother in law got a HUGE bowl of fruit fruit salad as a side. They forgot to bring my fruit so a man, drinking a Red Bull, brought out the smallest bowl of fruit in his hand, no tray. He gripped it with his fingers along the lip, not from the bottom. It was so weird and gross. My mother in law said the fruit was fresh. It looked good - blueberries, cantaloupe, honeydew, a sliced strawberry.  Back to the breakfast special which comes with three  strips of bacon and a large serving of potato wedges.

We wanted to sit down and have something to eat so we went to the newer section of the McCarran Airport in Las Vegas because this CPK seemed reasonable to comfortably take our time and eat lunch because it's the only large dine-in type restaurant in the airport.  It seemed they were understaffed when we went, so the service wasn't great, but I'm not upset about it because it was a holiday weekend and I'm not expecting excellent service at an airport anyways. Their menu is smaller than what you'd find at a typical CPK location but they have most of the popular items. We shared a Caesar salad and the BBQ Chicken Pizza. The portion sizes are also slightly smaller but it filled us up and we were happy with the meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-6

Chris A.,"Las Vegas, NV",850,405,1336,3.0,6/30/2016,"Got way delayed on our vacay trip to San Francisco, ended up catchin' a meal here at CPK in the McCarran Airport! For a chain I usually don't mind CPK, it's well known so the food should be fairly consistent.  This one though, was lacking in the food department.  Perhaps the airport environment messes with the quality a bit?  I dunno. The food overall wasn't bad, but it was definitely lackluster.  Just not the quality I was expecting for a CPK.  Not only were the portions smaller than I'm used to from them, our salad & pizzas were barely on the OK meter.  Not as fresh as they could be being that it is CPK! We ended up having: *California Cobb Salad - applewood smoked bacon, avocado, chicken, tomatoes, chopped egg, basil & Gorgonzola with house herb ranch dressing *Thai Chicken Pizza - grilled chicken breast with peanut sauce topped with crisp bean sprouts, carrots & scallions *Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage Pizza - cremini mushrooms, pepperoni, spicy Italian sausage, fresh basil, Mozzarella & Greek oregano Did I already say the serving sizes were on the small side?  I was wondering why the pricing at this particular CPK was a smidge cheaper than a full-sized CPK restaurant.  And did I get my answer!  The salad definitely came in a smaller bowl, and our pizzas definitely looked near an inch smaller in diameter than normal for CPK.  And we were hungry! Our California Cobb Salad was barely shareable for 3 of us.  It was OK but the lettuce just wasn't as crisp & cool as it could be.  My guess is that it sit under a heat lamp for a bit?  Was soggy in a few parts.  The bacon wasn't as crispy as I like it as well. The pizzas were just OK too, the serving size was just not what I normally expect.  This is akin to more of a personal pan pizza size, at least in my opinion.  The toppings were sparse on our Thai Chicken Pizza as well, very little chicken and too much crust.  Crust is good, but give me more toppings please! Not a bad lunch at McCarran's CPK, but you can for sure see its shortcomings as a restaurant.  Service was pretty good, our waiter did leave us hanging though for a while when we were looking for drink refills.  Other than that it was par for the course. Not sure if I would eat at this CPK again, might be better options for the money.  Up your airport pizza game, CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-6?start=20
Veronica L.,"Ewa Beach, HI",442,228,739,2.0,6/13/2016,"I have to agree with most of the reviews here - in the words of Flula from Pitch Perfect 2, this place was a ""heated mess.  You know, a mess where heat is applied to it so what once was a little messy is now even messier."" My family and I were on our way back to Honolulu from our weekend trip to Vegas.  We frequent Vegas a few times a year so we've always noticed this CPK in the Las Vegas McCarran Airport but didn't actually patronize it until that weekend.  We're actually more of a Chili's family which was right around the corner, about 5 or so gates down.  But upon our check-in with the Chili's hostess, were told it would be at least a 20-minute wait.  So CPK here we came. LOCATION:  conveniently located at the top of the escalators in Terminal 3 across from Ruby's Diner and Pandora. SERVICE:  extremely lacking.  Although we were seated almost immediately, it took a half an our for our waitress to bring us our drinks and I never received the sweetener I asked for to use in my iced tea.  I eventually gave up and got some from a different table.  Our waitress never noticed nor did she address the fact that she had forgotten.  Now, keep in mind, the restaurant was not very busy when we first got seated.  Business did pick up, but not soon enough to constitute such slow service.  It took over an hour to get our food - so long that we almost got it to-go because we were about to have to start boarding.  Our waitress kept apologizing and giving the excuse that they were busy.  And?  Don't most restaurants yearn for that?  And in a high-traffic airport. FOOD:  a little dfiferent from your stand-alone CPKs.  The menu has far less items and, in my case, different food items altogether.  At typical CPKs, I order the creamy alfredo, add chicken and broccolini.  Nowhere on the menu.  I did find, however, garlic cream chicken penne which was actually very tasty.  The rest of my table enjoyed their food as well, you know, once we finally got it.  In my opinion, the taste of the food is what gave this review an extra star. PRICE:eh, what you'd expect from a CPK in an airport. Bottom line, if you're not in a hurry and want something you're used to, by all means, stop here.

Alexey M.,"Ann Arbor, MI",0,8,11,1.0,1/20/2017,"KEEP YOUR RECEIPT!  I ate a soup (market veggie) and a pizza (California veggie) on January 3 2017 at 11.30am.

Lesley S.,"Dallas, TX",0,6,,1.0,5/12/2017,"Terrible service. Waited 15 minutes on the patio portion of the restaurant only to have a waitress stand 50 feet away in another room, shake her head at us, and walk away without saying anything to our table of 3. All we wanted to do was sit out on the patio while we ate so we could watch the planes takeoff and land. We decided to walk up to the front of the restaurant again, but to only be scolded at by the same waitress. We kindly told her that we didn't understand the head shake she gave us earlier, but big mistake - she responded by saying ""if people would get up and talk to me I could tell them!"" and went on about how understaffed they were, that we were being impatient, and (the cherry on top) ""do you want to sit down or not?!"". We finally get seated inside and received our water 30 minutes later. I will give this other waitress credit though - all of the other bartenders/waitresses/waiters were sitting at the bar on their phones. Another 20 minutes went by and one of my friends had to leave to catch his flight. Another 20 minutes after that, we were finally able to order. After we ordered our pizza, the waitress came back out and said that they are not making that pizza anymore (even though it was labeled as a CPK favorite?) so we had to choose another one. Fast forward another 20 minutes and our pizza finally comes out. It took a whopping hour and a half (at the very least) to get one mediocre pizza and water for two people.

It's a Thursday evening and I'm here as my flight is delayed to try and enjoy the cubs game. It was really the hostess that made it unpleasant for me. She first did not believe my id when I asked to sit at the bar. I am 26 so felt this was ridiculous. I asked to sit at a booth after instead of a table and she said I was making it so hard for her, she also came back to my table and just expressed her tiredness.

Michele M.,"Henderson, NV",92,251,407,1.0,3/15/2016,"This is not the same quality as any other CPK I have been to. When I walked up to the hostess stand, two men were standing there talking and completely ignored me. A woman came up a couple minutes later and asked if she could help me. Well, why else would I be standing there?  Even though it was breakfast, I ordered a pizza because the breakfast menu options weren't that great. I ordered what I usually get from CPK, the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Pizza. When it came out, first thing I noticed was the size. It's a little smaller than it usually is. Sure, it wasn't a big deal and to be honest, it was probably a good thing since I couldn't take leftovers with me, but I thought it was odd. I also noticed that it looked like the toppings were added after it was cooked. It's hard to explain but it looked ""off."" My waitress wasn't super friendly and I had to ask her for refills. Thats a pet peeve of mine. I also had to ask for my check. I think the restaurants in airports need to be on top of things because people are on a tight schedule! I fly a lot and love that you can watch the planes from the restaurant but sadly I will not return.

I had to choose between a miserable wait near the gate or what the universe summoned as an adventure around the airport to CPK, of all things. I took the latter.  Airport food is terrible and overpriced no matter what angle you take, but as the stray for a couple hours, I just needed to have a few drinks and eat something decent. The dumpy rating didn't turn me away. I figured ""no surprises"" at a California Pizza Kitchen. I know what to expect, I've been plenty of times before. What was a near empty restaurant with mostly baby boomers rounded up by the bar, turned into something far better than what I was anticipating. Felipe, my server was a cool dude! Cracking jokes, taking my order, asking where I was headed; it seemed as though everyone around me was having a nice time despite also facing long delays to their desired destination. This is the kind of server I wish was at every half-decent establishment in SLC.  The service made up for the overpriced, yet very small [and classic] BBQ Chicken Pizza. I walked in and was informed whiskey was half-price. I mean, would you resist when having five more hours to go? Could I have changed my ticket to Fireball Land instead of Salt Lake Land?

I used to be a California Pizza Kitchen regular when I lived in Texas & am pretty familiar with the menu. Many of the regular CPK dishes like the pesto pizza weren't on this one as I learn't it's a franchise location and finally I settled for the Veggie Pizza which looked oddly familiar. When the pizza arrived it was much smaller in size (which I didn't mind), however it didn't look or taste like any of the signature CPK pizzas. I'm pretty sure this one came straight out of a box from the frozen section. The crust was tasteless and underdone and over all the texture and taste left much to be desired. The veggies were wilted and clearly not fresh. Could barely finish it.  The service was rushed as they were understaffed and not equipped to deal with the convention crowds.

After a very long wait for the drinks and food, our order finally arrived. It was ice cold. Now maybe ice cold pizza is the ""in thing"" in Cali right now. But I doubt it. More likely it had been sitting in the kitchen for too long.  It also took repeated and drawn out efforts to get refills on our drinks. After being ignored for quite some time we managed to wave the waitress over. Her response was rather terse and rude. We then managed to get a nearby manager but it didn't help. In general they seem to care less about their customers. Perhaps they are all transients on their way somewhere else? They seemed to have had three ladies working the front podium and just one waitress working all the tables. And in general, all around bad attitudes.

Because when my wife tried to express her frustration the waitress just argued instead. Their management should realize that based on the majority of reviews for this location perhaps a change of staff is in order. They should start with that waitress.

We were going to say something, but the waitress didn't come back for another 10 minutes so we just said ""forget it"" and ate it. The only thing good about the salad was the interesting, asymmetric bowl it came in.  Pizzas were amateur and just whatever. We got the Hawaiian and Sicilian pizzas. Nothing special. I'm paying $13 for a small pizza that fits on a normal sized plate, with basically 1 piece of a bacon and 1 piece of pineapple per slice? You've got to be kidding me.  You'd think service would be faster considering people have places to go, but no. We sat around for another 10 minutes waiting to pay the bill after they brought us the check and we finally just got up and brought it to them because we hit our boarding time.

Katie M.,"Houston, TX",44,219,7,1.0,2/7/2014,"I would strongly avoid the LAS airport CPK - even if you're a CPK fan! First off, this restaurant is not like ""normal"" CPKs. The menu is different and the food is different. I got the Hawaiian pizza and I'm pretty sure it was not only smaller but used different ingredients and/or different preparation as well. It just didn't taste the same as what I've had at CPK before. Second, service is awful and I'm concerned about hygiene and food safety issues. My coworker avoids dairy products due to allergies so asked for one of the salads minus the mayo. The salad came out with mayo anyway, which my coworker found out after poking at the salad with her fork. When we notified the waiter, he at first acted like there wasn't mayo on it; my coworker again poked at the salad with her fork to show the waiter the mayo, and the waiter had a huge attitude about it and let out an exasperated sigh before taking the dish away. The waiter checked something in the system and no more than 30 seconds after he'd removed the salad from our table, delivered it to another table! I couldn't believe it. It's bad enough that the restaurant would redeliver a dish that the waiter had already put out on another table, but to actually redeliver one that he had seen my friend use her fork in! My friend hadn't actually eaten any of the salad or ever put the fork in her mouth - but the waiter sure didn't know that! I flagged down another waiter to complain to a manager, but none came before we had to leave to go catch our delayed flight. I don't know if the waiter just ignored us or the management just doesn't care.

Heather was my waiter one night at this CPK location. I had a two hour layover to Washington DC and she was very friendly and courteous. Service was fast and she checked in with me multiple times. Food: I ordered the Thai Chicken Pizza and the Red Velvet Cake for dessert. This CPK location has a limited menu, but nevertheless it soothe my cravings. I would also argue that there aren't that many great eateries at the Las Vegas airport. CPK was decent and its food deserves a 3 star. The velvet cake was actually pretty good. It wasn't super sweet and the icing was just perfect. The pizza could be improved as I felt it could have felt fresher by the time I got it. Total came out to be $19.76 before tip (including tax). Service: I have to give my waitress Heather (id #4020) a four star rating. She was very friendly and helpful. She recommended the velvet cake to me too. Service was unrushed and she took my order relatively fast.  Overall, I had no problem with this CPK and I never felt rushed even though I sat here, ate slowly, and killed time while waiting for my next flight.

We stayed at the Mirage, and there is a location within the casino.  This location is a bit different. The pizzas are smaller, and much less attention is given to detail. Our server, Denise, was very friendly and cheerful, and you've gotta love a server that deals with people from all over the world, from every time zone, no matter what time it is! Our table for two (round, and way too small) was clean and ready when we were seated. It's a great view - floor-to-ceiling windows with a view of the tarmac. Awesome to watch all the planes arriving, moving around, etc. They warned us that we need 40 minutes to get in & out, which was helpful. They were bang on (35 minutes) and we appreciated the gesture. We were thankful for the spent time - we needed to waste it! We paid $50.22 for our lunch (before tip): - 1 cosmopolitan ($10.99) - 1 double crown royal & diet ($12.49) - 1 chicken Caesar focaccia sandwich with potato chips ($10.99) - 1 Margarita pizza ($11.99) I think that's pretty good value (the food was good, not great...) for a sit-down meal at an airport. The pub we ate at in the Detroit airport was disgusting!

It's really nice to be served by someone who takes pride in what they do and cares to get to know their customer. I will be back next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-6?start=160
Kitty N.,"Arlington, VA",0,222,,4.0,1/11/2009,"This airport location was relatively quick. I had the slit pea/barley soup which was very tasty while I waited for my Thai chicken pizza to be prepared. They are very busy there, but should be fine if you're just doing takeout.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-6?start=160
Brett L.,"Seattle, WA",4,45,,1.0,12/19/2009,"this was by far the worst pizza I have had in a long time. It was basically a frozen cheese pizza that they added extra toppings on to as you ordered.  It was stale, only kinda warm and well pretty much sucked.  I know it's an airport, but I have had wolfgang pucks pizza at the chicago airport and its decent.  the thing that i like about chains is i usally know what im getting, but this was horrible.  Ill go back to cpk probbaly just not in an airport.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-6?start=160
