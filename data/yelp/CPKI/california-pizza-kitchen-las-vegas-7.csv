Lisa W.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,48,16,5.0,11/11/2017,"We had just gotten off a plane, settled into our hotel across the street, and were meeting my cousins at the Mirage. We were hungry! We decided on the California Pizza Kitchen and we weren't disappointed. I had the Kung Pao Spaghetti and my friend had the Thai Crunch salad! Both of these were awesome!! I really loved how they were able to combine all the flavors of Kung Pao in the spaghetti! We both wanted to lick our plates! I'd eat there again in a heart beat!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-7
Howard S.,"The Colony, TX",13,358,440,3.0,11/5/2017,"My wife and I stopped here for dinner before the late Cirque du Soleil show. We were seated promptly but then, service was relatively slow. It looked as if our server had too many tables. One nice feature is that half of the restaurant overlooks the giant sports betting area, which makes it fun to watch lots of games at once. We both ordered cocktails and both thought they were extremely strong. Some people may like being served extra alcohol in their drinks but I could barely taste the mixers. It was like drinking straight vodka. My Kung Pow Spaghetti was good but everything else was just average. Nevertheless, if you were hungry, it is a reasonably-priced place to have dinner at the Mirage.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-7
Simon C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",240,66,108,3.0,8/23/2017,"Came to here to eat because we wanted some salad.  We ordered the BBQ Chicken salad and decided to indulge in a chocolate/ice cream dessert. I gave this place a 3 star because although the food was okay, the service was not up to par.  The salad was appetizing and can feed two people.  The dessert was also fantastic because the ice cream and chocolate just complimented each other.  The service though was a little disappointing.  When I eat, I drink a lot of water.  And let's say it was hard to get a full glass of water.  It was very difficult to get the attention of the waitresses because they would rather tend to larger groups.  I even had a waitress make eye contact with me and totally look away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-7
Danny L.,"Downey, CA",32,9,5,1.0,12/16/2017,"The service is horrible, I don't know how they can have one person running the counter top, the take out line and serve drinks for the customers inside the lobby. That's not fair on him and making people wait over 45 mins to  a hour for food. This was a waste of time for this food/service. I don't recommend coming here at all.

Regina W.,"Cleveland, OH",41,44,32,3.0,11/21/2017,"I've been to California Pizza at a different location, and was disappointed in this one. The waitress wasn't friendly and didn't take our orders correct and it's also located in the casino, next to the sports center and the smoke is VERY strong (reasons for star deductions). However, I love their mango lemonade and the chopped Italian salad. The margarita pizza and club pizza were good. It's more of a speciality pizza joint instead of a regular pepperoni pizza place. I would recommend the salad and lemonade, but at a different location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-7
Kelly W.,"Los Angeles, CA",471,642,695,4.0,1/3/2017,"My family and I ate here twice during our Christmas vacation. You can always count on CPK for reliable good food. It's not gourmet but it's the same at every location, more or less. On both occasions we had really good service even though they were busy.  There was a variety of items that we tried from soups to salads to pasta and pizza. Everything was really good. It's nice that they are able to get people seated quickly and you don't have to wait forever. One night we were going to go to The Pantry and the line was long and there was no hostess to give any information so we ended up back at CPK. I tried the peach lemonade for the first time and I have to say...I'm hooked. Give it a try, it's delicious. We'll be back here again on our next vacation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-7
Lisa Marie M.,"Vancouver, Canada",1510,502,4163,4.0,5/10/2017,"Always delicious with great attentive service. Located in the Mirage casino right by the race and sports book. You can watch the big screens as you eat if you would like. It's open air seating, so it can get a bit loud if it's busy in the casino. I love the Thai chicken pizza. I always love Hawaiian. You can get half and half for 3$ extra.  They also have delicious pasta as well,  if your looking for something other then pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-7

Pete A.,"Las Vegas, NV",578,146,207,4.0,9/26/2017,"This chain inside the Mirage Casino is great because it is located near the entrance facing the strip.

Jordan I.,"Las Vegas, NV",69,135,791,2.0,3/22/2017,"First things first! The food was decent... Nothing too spectacular. It's just like every other CPK I've been to. The only difference being is the hiked up prices because of the restaurant being located on the Strip. That was expected, however the service we received was not! I met up with a few friends who were visiting from out of town to get some dinner. My friends arrived before me and they were able to get a booth almost immediately. Great! I arrived a few minutes later and there were already waters at our table. They told me that our server wasn't the one who brought the waters to the table and were just told by the hostess that she would be with us in a few minutes. In fact, another server named Alberto was kind enough to keep refilling our waters throughout our meal. A for Alberto or A for awesome? ""A few minutes"" turned into almost 20 and our server finally came back to our table. She didn't even introduce herself or seem very friendly. To top it off, I felt rushed when she was taking our order. She was just overall not very personable. Our order came to the table in a decent amount of time, but we also had to ask for our complimentary bread that I'm assuming was supposed to be served upon arrival to the table. Hmmm... Maybe not? After our order arrived, we had only seen our server once throughout our meal. The last time we saw her was when she dropped the check off at the table!  Anyways, our experience here was mediocre and I feel like it could've been so much better had our server been a bit more mindful of the vibe she was putting off. With that being said, I probably won't be returning to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-7

Jacqueline H.,"Schwenksville, PA",6,92,190,2.0,2/22/2017,"This CPK is located within the Mirage. We went up to the hostess stand and stood there for five minutes because the hostess was nowhere to be found. Eventually we were seated, and our waitress took our drink orders. Unfortunately, they don't carry lemons for your water/soda. The spinach artichoke dip came quickly and was delicious. We were also given some Italian bread and olive oil for dipping. For entrees, my partner and I ordered  shrimp scampi entrees, which were just ok. I did not think they were flavorful enough. However, the dishes did come with a generous amount of shrimp. We were not offered dessert at the end. The whole reason we came to CPK for dinner was because my boyfriend's mother gave us two $25 gift cards to this restaurant to celebrate our trip to Vegas. Lo and behold, our waitress told us that the parent company of Mirage does not allow people to use CPK gift cards at that location, and this is clearly stated on the back of the card. She did advise that the other location in Caesar's does accept gift cards. We would not come back to this location the next time we are out here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-7
Andrea C.,"Irvine, CA",154,148,48,1.0,7/24/2017,"I usually like eating at CPK but this one honestly isn't good whatsoever. The waitress rushed us to order as soon as we got there. We barley sat down and she was already asking what we wanted to eat. I ordered plain pasta with grilled chicken and the chicken was hard and chewy. It was like eating a piece of gum. It was honestly the worst chicken I have ever ate. I asked a different lady that works there if the chicken is cooked enough and showed her my plate and she even said that something was wrong with it because it was so hard to cut. My waitress said that it was ""normal"" and that the chef is strict on temperature of food. Well guess what? my mother is a chef and I know what chicken is supposed to taste like and this was definitely not it.  I highly don't recommend this place. Don't eat here so you don't risk getting sick.  Also the prices are wayyyyy higher than any other CPK I have been to.

Tushar A.,"Minneapolis, MN",125,223,738,3.0,12/27/2016,"Really slow service for a restaurant. On a Monday just after Christmas in Vegas, you need to anticipate your customers specially when you know The Mirage is booked completely, which is where this restaurant is. They seemed under staffed. We were not seated for almost 15 mins at 7:45pm which should be the busiest time, however with so many tables that we could see were clean and available and no reservations taken, this was just weird.  Finally thanks to a server, we could get a table, as he kept pushing the fellow at the concierge to get us in as many tables were available. Once seated, we decided our menu right away as we were suppose to watch the show on Treasure Island and it was already 8:10 pm now. We were looking at every available server who was running around but not one came for taking our order. Finally after asking the concierge to send someone, we had a server, who took all our order at once and thankfully also asked the cook to accommodate our request of serving faster. We did get the food in 20 mins and since we didn't have much time, had to gulp our food faster. The penne cream with shrimp was tasty but the Thai crunch salad with chicken was missing something. Couldn't figure out what, as it wasn't tasting the same as it does normally. Nevertheless thanks to the servers who saw our agony and helped us get out of there in an hour. Lesson learned- Go here when you have plenty of time to churn.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-7?start=20

Lol the manager had to take my drink order because they were all in the weeds. Food was even worse. Sent back app...

A P.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,7,1,2.0,7/25/2017,"They recently changed the menu for the worst.  We used to order the California club pizza and another one that I can't remember.

Katherine A.,"Las Vegas, NV",333,150,1660,3.0,6/17/2015,"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 55/100*** It has been over a year since we've visited CPK located inside the Mirage. I'm not a huge fan of this particular location because it's hectic most of the time and that almost guarantees a not so spectacular dining experience but we were in the area and pizza was on our minds. I was pleasantly surprised when we got there at a little after 6 pm, the wait was only about 10 minutes even though the place was abuzz due to the NBA finals. We were seated right in the middle of all the action so excitement was in the air, I didn't even notice that it took them about 15 minutes to take our drink orders. My husband, not a huge basketball fan, decided to entertain himself by timing how long it would take the servers to refill our drinks or take the used appetizer plates although I wished he had done that after we placed our food order because that took at least 45 minutes and I would've wanted to know how long it took exactly. The servers noticed as he was doing it but it didn't really make a difference service wise lol. For appetizer we ordered their Spinach artichoke dip ($13.50) the dip itself was very tasty but it was hard to bypass the chips which were soaked and glistening with oil.  We got 3 kinds of pizza shared amongst 4 adults and 2 kids:  -Thai chicken pizza with grilled chicken, peanut sauce and topped with bean sprouts on thin crust ($19+) -White pizza with 4 kinds of cheeses, sautéed spinach and roasted garlic on hand tossed crust ($17+) -Sicilian pizza with Italian sausage, Capicola ham, Salami also on thin crust ($18+) I was looking forward to eating the butter cake with ice cream for dessert but by the time we finished we were stuffed. I wouldn't be opposed to eating here again because the food is actually tasty but it's not something I would seek out due to the location. Even with the $2-3 mark up because of the casino location, they do offer Vegas locals 20% off the entire bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-7?start=20

I'm a big fan of the frozen CPK pizzas, so thought the 'real thing' would be...  spectacular!

Sara A.,"Hemet, CA",112,84,84,3.0,1/1/2017,"Ate here on 12/26/16, for our second night during our four day vacation. Place was pretty busy but we got seated within a short amount of time. Took a little bit of time to get our drink order in, took even more time to get our drinks. Once they came out the lady refilling them was very attentive and friendly, saw her more often than our waitress. Everything we ordered, including the complimentary bread, took a long time to arrive at the table. Food was  good, would of been better if hadn't taken quite so long.

Linda B.,"Monterey Park, CA",618,317,848,3.0,9/1/2016,"Food is great, but not really pleased with the service. Makes me sad because I've worked for a CPK for over 9 years now and I'll always come back because of its unique and innovative dishes. Forreals though, the food tastes exactly the same as my own restaurant and gives me the comfort of familiarity while I'm away partying, which is why I even came to eat at a CPK in VEGAS. Service definitely could've been better. The hosts sat my friends and I at a table where it took about five-ish minutes before our server came by to greet us. She informed us that waters were already on its way to us (which was brought to us by a different staff member), didn't make any suggestions from the menu-which is fine, I already knew it like the back of my hand. Server said they'd give us some time and she would return shortly. She took about another 10 minutes to return and we ordered. We didn't get the complimentary bread-I didn't want any but my friends did. Tables that sat around us after got much faster service from our same server with their drinks and bread. Our appetizer Spinach Dip arrived at a timely manner as well as our Waldorf Salad and Spicy Chipotle Pizza. These items were dropped off by another wait staff and they did not ask if we needed anything such as black pepper (for the salad) or parmesan cheese or red chili flakes; we didn't see our server until we were more than half way done with our meal. We finished everything and did not want dessert. We asked for our bill and it took some time for her to bring it to us.  I'll just say that if you're coming for the food and you're already familiar with it, then come! Just don't expect much from the servers, they aren't very engaging and you might not be properly set up to enjoy your meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-7?start=20

She did not offer to go and ask the kitchen about possible safer options. She just told us to be careful what we ordered. When our food arrived, after we waited almost 30 minutes in the nearly empty restaurant, my macaroni and cheese was only warm, and looked slightly congealed. Ugh. The service was the slowest I have ever experienced and none of the waiters/waitresses seemed interested in refilling glasses.

I'm also ticked off because I waited nearly 15min before I was asked ""are you ready?"" When I haven't even been handed a glass of water or ordered a drink yet. The restaurant was not busy., it was mid day- Monday.  When I finally was able to order my food, I ordered the top rated bbq chicken pizza.

This location is inside of the Mirage Hotel & Casino situated next to the Sportsbook! I really think it's convenient that they offer the ""to-go"" option on one of the sides of the restaurant for those people who would like to order their food and head back to their seats for the game! When I arrived I was a bit confused as to where I was initially suppose to order but the manager was gracious enough to take my order in the ""non designated "" spot. Service was good from the little interaction I had with the staff and the food was just okay. I was instantly reminded that the reason I never really eat at CPK is it's not worth the price. The spinach and artichoke dip that we ordered I believe we got ripped off something wicked on the amount of actual dip. For $13 and some change I wasn't impressed, and of course they give you 6 bags of tortilla chips with 3 ounces of dip...

They definitely updated their menu and got rid of my favorite pizza (the caramelized onion - goat cheese - arugula one), but I was still hopeful about the items I chose (the avocado club egg rolls and the Thai Chicken pizza). Sadly, between the spotty/downright slow service and the fact that both items I ordered were just okay, I doubt I'll be eating at CPK anytime soon (I mean, it's a chain, so one must assume all of their food is generally the same). The biggest problem with both the egg rolls and my pizza was that they were downright bland. Price-wise, everything was average for Vegas (the egg rolls were something like $13.50 and the pizza was $17.50) but honestly there *are* places on and around the Strip where you can get better food for the same prices or cheaper.

Christina T.,"San Diego, CA",569,489,2127,2.0,9/26/2012,"This location is prime, situated directly in the middle of the casino. Definitely a lackluster experience, despite being a popular chain in my hometown. I had the fettuccine alfredo with chicken, since it's always a safe bet. The alfredo sauce was bland and the chicken tasted like it was frozen - dry, chewy, and tasteless. Granted, I'm the kind of woman that prefers chicken breast meat over dark meat, but the chicken was beyond dry! I didn't have much before my stomach started acting up. If you even have a remotely weak stomach like me, as greasy foods make my stomach churn, you know that the first jab of pain signals a LONG bathroom visit. Halfway through the meal I told my partner that I had to leave and scrammed to the nearest bathroom, which, by the way, was quite far since casino bathrooms are often at opposite ends. Three bathroom trips later, while still hugging my stomach, I am reminded of why I often stick to salads at such places. Service-wise, seating is fast and the waitress checked on us quite often.

Alternatives are not plenty here and I stumbled upon this place and though I would give a try for old times sake! My friend and I were not that hungry so I suggested that we share a pizza ""Pear and Gorgonzola"". It was good and one was plenty for both of us as we could not finished it.

I haven't had CPK since highschool and remembered liking this. It was decent enough flavor and the thin crust had good crisp texture, but I don't like how the bean sprouts weren't trimmed and weren't as fresh as they could be.  A plus was when we said we were in a time crunch as we were working a event, our server did his best to help expedite it, like bring us our check while we were eating and such.

We decided to come here since it was close and it was open.  Unfortunately, I should have just sucked it up and went somewhere else.   CPK is a chain, so I knew that the food here would not be too bad, and it wasn't.  The service is the main reason for my 2 star review. There was no line when we first arrived.  There were plenty of booths open, but we got seated in the center of the restaurant... which was really awkward.  I asked to be seated at a booth, and the hostess gave me a dirty look and told me ""I guess, if you want"".  So... I've been a hostess before, and I know to never turn down a guest if there is no reservation for the table.  The server may be double-seated, but it was not busy there, in fact, there were only a few tables there that were even seated and they all had their food, so I think it was manageable.  We waited there for about 10 minutes until someone came to greet us.  And then another 10 to get waters.  When she took our order, I didn't feel like she was extremely friendly.  This might be because it was towards the end of her shift, but I didn't like it.

Their pizzas, normally around $13, are almost $20 here. WTF.  I know it's on the strip, but what a racket.

My favs are the spinach and articoke dip, chinese chicken salad, and the California Club pizza. Almost everything I go to this establishment, if I'm with friends and family, we'll share a California Club. If I'm getting food for myself or going with one other person (like a boyfriend), most likely I'll be getting a salad. Expect prices here to be a bit higher than normal.

I can't remember what time it was exactly, but we only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table so it wasn't too bad. It was busy when we went, and it seemed like they were pretty much always busy, regardless of the time. We actually had CPK twice. Once, we dined in and the other my boyfriend ordered and brought back to our room for a late night dinner when I didn't feel like getting out of my PJ's. Both times, we got the Garlic Cheese Focaccia as an appetizer and it was pretty dang good. The first time, we got the Tostada Pizza with chicken added and it was actually really good. Really crispy crust and the salsa they put on the side is legit. The second time, we got the Meat Cravers which was just alright. I usually like to have some kind of vegetables on my pizza, and my boyfriend says no way. So I usually have to side with him, as I did in this case. It wasn't terrible, just not my cup of tea. I think this is definitely a legit option if you're staying at the Mirage or someplace close by. The prices aren't terrible, but you have to remember that any restaurant in a hotel is going to be more pricey than those outside the hotels. This place isn't too bad considering the amount of food that you get. The service also stays on par with most other restaurants, and the food is pretty good.

I am positive it takes more than 5 minutes to cook and assemble a pizza, so it was either pre-made and reheated or we were given some table who walked outs pizza.

No checking if we wanted refills on our drinks or if we were even done or satisfied with our meal.

Chris A.,"Las Vegas, NV",850,405,1336,3.0,6/17/2008,"I've been here before and I remember it being a better experience.  Maybe the place is just too mainstream now, more quantity than quality?  I don't know.  Maybe it's just because my taste buds have grown up in the past several years. We went here on a Friday night, so it was packed.  We waited for probably 10 minutes for a table.  Good thing is this CPK in the Mirage is located right next to the sports book so we could at least catch the scores.  We finally got a seat and proceeded to order drinks.  Our waiter was friendly and courteous.  We got our complimentary plate of bread (what happened to a basket?  Geez.) of like 3 slices for the 2 of us with some butter.  The bread was already cold, almost as cold as the butter.  I had to schuck it aside.  Boo. They had a few new pizzas on the menu (the Buffalo Chicken pizza stands out), but I usually stick to my fav, Original BBQ Chicken pizza on Honey Wheat dough.  But I felt different today, I wanted a change.  I couldn't decide between the Thai Chicken Pizza or the Jamaican Jerk Chicken pizza.  Our waiter suggested the Thai Chicken because it's on of his favorites.  I added Honey Wheat dough to it for my crust.  My fellow diner got the Tostada pizza.  This was his first time here, so the Mexican side of him (he's HAOLE (caucasian guy to you mainlanders)....HA HA) wanted to try this.   In between waiting for our pizzas we were entertained by lots of people.  Some big, some little, some kids...all of them happy by being out it seems.  Nice to see even in our rough economy families have time to spend with each other.  There was even this ONE guy that came in to dine with 7 chicks!  No joke!  One of the girls was getting hitched I think.  He was the spectacle of the evening. Our food finally came.  My Thai Chicken pizza looked excellent!  Fresh and bubbly from the Mozzarella cheese.  It tasted just as good too.  The marinated chicken breast went well with the peanut-ginger and sesame sauce on the pizza.  The green onions and cilantro just carried the Asian flavors.  Carrots, bean sprouts and  roasted peanuts gave the pizza some great texture and crunch.  My waiter had made a most excellent suggestion and I was pleased.  The crust was great as well, not too thick, crunchy on the crust, not doughy in the middle, and with a clean, slightly sweet taste from the honey. My friend said his Tostada pizza was excellent as well.  He liked the grilled lime chicken and the black beans and how it complimented the sharp Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses.  The fresh lettuce and  crispy tortilla strips on the pizza were a welcome and refreshing crunch.  The pizza was supposed to come with herb ranch dressing, but it wasn't apparent on the pizza or on the side.  It was ok, my friend said it didn't need it anyway.  Overall, he was pleased on his first visit to CPK. This place is not so bad for a quick, little bit cheaper dinner (but not by much) if you have to eat at a sit down joint on the Strip.  Average pizza price is around $12-$13 for one individual pizza.  Come on, pizza...it shouldn't be TOO expensive, even if it's gourmet!  This place would have gotten 4 stars if my bread came HOT and in a BASKET (I know, strange) and if the prices were a little less stiff.  It might have gotten a 5 star if those 7 chicks came to sit with us instead!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-7?start=160

Investing in glass dividers to allow for some privacy would help. Luckily, we got one of the inside booths.  The bread wasn't very good, questionably stale. I usually like the bread at CPK too. If sushi bars can get fresh fish to the desert, CPK should be able to get some non crappy fresh bread. The four cheese ravioli with sautéed mushroom was just okay. Usually sautéed mushrooms have more flavor, but it was just lacking in the dish. After finishing the dish, I felt that disgusted can't believe I ate that feeling. Just something about the sauce made me feel this way. My friend's spaghetti with tomato and meat sauce just didn't look very appetizing. He took a couple of bites and stopped. Food came out fairly quickly, but don't expect to really get the great service of a traditional restaurant. You will have to flag the waiters if you want anything.  My meal came out to around $16, which for a casino restaurant isn't bad. But had I gone to local spots, I would get better food and value. Not a bad place, but pales in comparison to the real CPK back in California.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-7?start=160

Mark D.,"North Las Vegas, NV",106,131,20,3.0,2/21/2011,"Me being an avid fan of pizza, I would probably would put this under an OK review.  The place was in the middle of Mirage, some where and of course it was packed.  We were hoping to beat the long lines, but unfortunately the lines were long, no matter how early we went before lunch.  We were there to buy show tickets and wanted to check it out.  I never been to the California Pizza Kitchen before.  So why not.   The place itself, seem smaller then I expected to be for a Pizza Parlor.  So you got people standing in line, waiting on tables, cause the place was jammed packed.  Not sure how long we waited but a good 30 minutes that went by and didn't really see the front of the line.  But they had staff going around, asking if there was a party of two, which was the wife and I.  Kind of felt bad that we had to pass up those before us.  But we were told that it would be right in front of the bar.  So its not an actual table, its the bar.  The place you actually sit at, to see people pour you a beer right in front of you.  So, not only was it awkward to go before others, but kind of awkward to be sitting next to a beer fountain and eat pizza, especially if your not drinking beer.  Overall, the place is easily crowded and not as roomy, but it probably be nicer, if it was less crowded.   We had California Pizza Frozen Pizza before, in which I probably would prefer the frozen pizza over the pizza parlor.  The pizza was okay, but seem a bit flatter then the frozen pizza.  Getting a personalize size pizza, is kind of cool, but I wasn't really digging it as much.  It look like, they did take their time cooking it, but it did look like they just threw it all together and toss it in the oven.  Not knowing if the peperoni is sticking together or stacked.  But it was edible, and it did feel me up. If you do ever get a chance, probably go when its not busy.  Probably get a table that hasn't have some one pouring a glass of beer in front of you every 5 minutes.  Otherwise, your probably better off with the frozen version.   But if I came here in better circumstances, then maybe, I'll like it more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-7?start=160

It is spicy I must warn you but well worth it. A must try if you never have. It is so good I bought the CPK cookbook and the recipe for Kung Pao spaghetti is in there so one day I intend on giving it a try myself.

Rosie S.,"Charlottetown, Canada",205,218,151,5.0,12/2/2011,"GREAT casual resto! We stayed at the Mirage and loved this place. Mr. and I went to lunch here - it was very busy, but we did go at 1:45 p.m. on the first Sunday of the NFL. It's right beside the game/sports room in the Mirage, so it's a fab place to watch the game. There were no tables available, so the hostess offered us seats at the bar, which offers the full menu too. No prob! We were trying to get fed and get out to the pool as quickly as possible! We ordered two pizzas, a glass of champagne, and a diet coke. Service was quick and friendly. Space was a'plenty to eat at the bar. Not cramped at all.  It was cool getting to see the kitchen in action (they do the pizzas out front, where the bar is, and the rest is cooked in the back - read hidden - kitchen) from our seats. We also had full view of the restaurant for people watching, at least six TVs playing 3-4 different sporting events, as well as the wall of the sports book next door ( ). PIZZA RATING SYSTEM GO! Crust Texture: Thin, but not so thin that it's all crunch - still a good chewy/crisp combo. Crust Flavor: Starchy-sweet. Not salty or tangy. Good, mild flavour. Sauce Flavor: Nothing of note. It was there - not particularly tomatoey, not particularly herbal, not particularly sweet or salty. Sauce Amount: On the minimal side. Cheese Flavour: YUM! Salty and cheesy - tastes like real cheese as opposed to a lot of cheap pizza places. Cheese Amount: Generous - very American-style heavy-handed. Next time I would ask for less, but it's not like it made it inedible - I love cheese... just a little on the overkill side of things. Topping Quality: AWESOME! Fresh, interesting, top quality. Nice! Topping Amount: Wonderful! Verging on perfect - heavy on the mushrooms, and they were very fresh, with a wide range of types. Well done, CPK! Presentation: Nothing special - great big plates covered with your pizza! It looks very yummy though - nice and brown on top, bubbly cheese on the perimeter, no pooling oil or grease! Overall Taste: Better than delivery, not as good as most authentic Italian pizzerias. Better than the other casual joints in The Mirage.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-7?start=140

On this visit, I had the Jerk Pizza without onions and peppers, and it was great. Price was a little high, but again it was in the Mirage. Everyone else was satisfied with the food. The server ended up getting on pizza wrong brought out a pasta dish. It took about 10 minutes for the pizza to come back out when everyone was close to half way done. There was no half off or other comp for the mistake. The other issue was is that I paid for everyones pizza with my CC, and noticed it seemed high but didnt think anything of it.

Cynthia O.,"Lomita, CA",177,41,11,2.0,3/1/2013,"Our 1st nite staying at the Mirage on 2/7 , we went downstairs and decided to order pizza for take-out.  As my daughter paid and picked up the pizza, she asked our server, Jim, for some plates. Jim looked at her quizzically and asked why.  She replied that we wanted to eat in our room.  He returned with 4 plastic lids from take out containers and asked her if she was ""from the bum jungle, you know, outside?""  She was taken aback and restated that we are guests in the hotel simply wanting to eat upstairs.  He shrugged and walked away. Very upset by this exchange, my daughter spoke to the manager who was very unhelpful, simply saying that ""he is usually very nice"".   Well, understandably that ruined our evening, especially when we found we could have ordered a room service pizza for less, and received all the accompaniments we needed.  I will definitely be forwarding my pictures of the take-out lids/plates given to us for our dining pleasure, but feel you need to be aware of the shoddy customer service provided by your casino restaurant wait staff.  In hindsight, I wish I would have returned the pizza and gone immediately to the Mirage management. Upon our return home I reported it to the CPK offices, who - unlike the CPK #10 floor manager - acted very quickly to try to rectify this experience.  We did receive apologies from The Mirage management as well as 2 ""be our guest"" cards from the CPK.  We appreciate the actions of the CPK offices and the Mirage, however it is very unlikely we will return to the CPK #10 located inside The Mirage.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-7?start=120

My boyfriend & I had just left our friends at Hakkasan & were trying to find somewhere to eat. There wasn't a lot open late-ish on a Monday night (after EDC) in Vegas but we found this CPK! I tried calling to place our order ahead since it was about an hour from closing- I didn't want the kitchen to close before we got there. When I called someone rudely told me that I had be staying at the Mirage to order for pick-up & then hung up on me. When I got there I discovered our hotel was also covered under their to-go orders... oh well, we were already there. The hostess was extremely nice & told us we could order at the bar. It only got worse from there... the bartender completely ignored us. I tried to ask if I could order & he acted as if he didn't hear and then walked away. I had to get one of the chefs to take the order. The man working behind the bar was rude, unpleasant & by far the most negative attitude I encountered during my week in Vegas. We were sober so it's not like we were being loud, causing a commotion or asking for anything extraordinary. I can understand getting annoyed with someone causing a scene but we were just trying to find a late dinner. So, one star for good food & one star for the super awesome hostess. And minus 3 for the bartender with an attitude problem.  PS, thanks so much to the cook for stepping up to take our order.

Jackie G.,"Chicago, IL",26,236,164,2.0,3/30/2010,"I frequent California Pizza Kitchen in the northwest suburbs of Chicago, so when my mom suggested going to this CPK, while on vacation in Las Vegas, I said, ""... but I can go there any time."" Other members of our traveling group had never experienced CPK, so we ended up giving this one a shot. Sorry for the pun, but it was worth the gamble. While waiting in line for seating, I changed my mood and looked forward to the meal, wanting to order my favorite CPK meal, Chicken Milanese. Sadly, when I finally got a chance to open my menu, there was no Chicken Milanese listed! The California Pizza Kitchen website lists the dish as one of its specialties, so this came as a surprise. I went for my second favorite option (again, not pizza), the Original BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad, dressing on the side. I split it with my neighbor, who ordered the Original BBQ Chicken Pizza. The pizza was fine but the chicken in the salad, moist as it was, lacked enough BBQ sauce and thus zing that usually accompanies the crisp, fresh combination of ingredients in this salad.  My table asked for the sourdough bread to eat while waiting for the food. We got a pathetic hole/airy looking loaf along with some cold butter. We ate it and asked for more - no carb concern here, especially on vacay - and the second serving was better.  The wait staff took care of our requests with smiles and also refilled our waters and drinks regularly. Nonetheless, the food failed to match up to the standards that other CPK's have accustomed me to. My group, including first timers, enjoyed the experience overall, so I think they will be pleasantly surprised by the California Pizza Kitchen experience at home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-7?start=180

We are not big fans of Vietnamese style Spring Rolls.  We actually ordered them by mistake thinking they were Egg Rolls (deep fried).  Duh!  So we only took a bite to taste and didn't care for them.   I fell IN LOVE with my Kung Pao Spaghetti at first bite.  It was flavorful and spicy.  Who would have thought to cook Kung Pao with Spaghetti noodles?  The peanuts gave the noodle extra kick. My fiance loved his Chicken Tequilla Fettuccine, too.  He even used the bread to pick up any sauce left over on the plate.  Yes I know, it's not proper etiquette, but this is no 5-star restaurant.   We only ordered iced tea since neither one of us is a drinker.  And I honestly couldn't remember if we ordered any dessert and if we did, what it was!  All I could remember was that we were stuffed and didn't even use up all $60!!!   We have been back to CPK at different locations since (most often at Brea where it's the closest to home), and we order the same thing every time because that's how much we like them!  I have even learned to make Kung Pao Spaghetti at home and it's a hit with everyone.  Well, I am Chinese, so I'd better know my Kung Pao!
