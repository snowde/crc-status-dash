Beautiful environment all around. They start you off with olive oil with some seasoning and French bread. For appetizer I ordered the spinach artichoke and tortilla chips. Spinach artichoke was very creamy and the tortilla chips wonderfully colorful. Ordered the carne asada pizza. Very delicious and flavorful.

Not a hot pepper, a finger food and tasty as all get out. Sautéed in olive oil with sea salt and red chili flakes they are beyond good. This was on a Tuesday, it is now Saturday and I've had my 3rd lunch at CPK Las Vegas . Our server, Terrah, is reason enough to keep going back, such a lovely girl and remembered my girl and I . The salads are massive so I got a half order and it was plenty, plus, you can do add ons.There was another gentleman that we sat with but I do not recall his name (my bad ) he was wonderful. I feel I must mention Caesar who was ever so nice. A manager (female) stopped by to chat with us and we really did appreciate that. I used to go to CPK years ago in Atlanta and I must say that they have come a long way as the menu is just outstanding, we love it. I was not aware of the butter cake so gotta go back for that.

Christina G.,"Las Vegas, NV",67,60,178,5.0,3/27/2017,Haven't had CPK in years and really enjoyed this location. They still carry many original dishes that aren't around anymore. They are located inside of the Fashion Show mall But easy to find if you park by Dillard's. The service we received both times from Ashley A. Was wonderful!!! She's a California native like myself and truly does make you feel welcome. She made sure our orders were on point and made great suggestions for us to try. The manager Jamie also checked up on us often. They were busy behind the bar and my cocktail did take some time to arrive and she comped the beverage which was unnecessary but a nice surprise. They also treated us to a lovely dessert which was wonderful and unexpected. They truly do go above and beyond when it comes to customer service and ensure their guests are happy.

Meghan M.,"Las Vegas, NV",303,153,152,5.0,9/21/2016,"I absolutely love this location! This location is gorgeous and a really sweet treat if you are shopping at the Fashion Show. I have been visiting this location for years and it is definitely my favorite location. The manager, Jamie, is the sweetest thing since butter cake (if you haven't tried it, PLEASE TRY IT NOW!) I usually come to this location to stop by and visit some old friends, Casey, one of the best servers I have ever had in any dining establishment. (*Quick story*We met Casey at his old restaurant Sammy's Woodfired Pizza and one day stumbled across him serving at CPK at Fashion Show. It's a good thing because the quality of the food at Sammy's has gone down, and the quality of service/food/overall dining at CPK has gone up!) I like to credit some of that to the amazing server, Casey, that always knows how to have a party! That guy always asks about our kids, how we are doing, how life is going, and how the food is tasting!  Jamie, his boss, is the coolest gal around! Casey ran to his boss and introduced us to her, gave her the whole story how we basically stalked him, and now we run into him 2x/month. She is always so excited to see us come in, which makes each visit worth while. I absolutely love being welcomed with open arms, makes this place feel like a home away from home. As for the food, the little bite are always a good treat before the meal. I usually indulge in the mac n cheese bites, or the flat breads, because they're usually really delicious! I also go for the seasonal salad, it's like watermelon with feta, to die for!!  The pizzas are always good, but there's something about the pastas here that keeps me coming back. I really love this location and the hospitality I receive. Can't wait to go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas

Paulamertha A.,"Suisun City, CA",287,472,639,4.0,9/9/2014,"As a California native, I try my best to avoid anything California related (specifically when it comes to food) when I'm on vacation. However, since my group wanted to dine here, after a couple hours of shopping, I was out numbered. The service here is on point!! I forgot what our waiter's name was now, but he was friendly, helpful, and extremely attentive to our needs. I saw him behind the bar area (or what ever that was) talking to another customer, but somehow he knew we needed refills. He brought our refills right over to us before our drinks were completely empty. I'm truly impressed with the service we received here. I honestly wasn't impressed with the food. I live in California and I always avoided eating at this place because I had a feeling that the pizza wouldn't be that great. I was right. My pizza was on the bland side, even after adding parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes. My boyfriend's pizza tasted a lot better than mine. My sister's dish, I think she ordered a sandwich or something, but her's was delicious. I'm just a bit disappointed that a pizza restaurant would have a hit or miss menu when it comes to their pizza (which they are allegedly known for). I would give this place 3 out of 5 stars, but since the service was so great I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars. Although my pizza was a disappointment, there are other items on their menu that tasted pretty good. I wouldn't mind trying this place out again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas?start=40

Our food was ordered appropriately but he just kinda threw it in the table, no napkins, no water, we are the first customers here coz we arrived when they just opened so it's not busy at all!!! No reason to rush or be inappropriate, did not ask how wer doing I had to ask another server to give us napkins, extra sauce and small spoon!! and we have little kids! It was my birthday so I think my husband asked him to bring in cake with candle so me and the kids can blow it, not looking for free dessert coz we are stuffed on how much food we ordered! he just left the cake and lit it up and said ""here u go"" who does that! Usually the staff sings with ur family and wish u a happy bday! I mean that's what I see everytime somebody has a birthday to celebrate at the restaurant! Talked to Kelli manager, she was offering something to make it better! We refused! We have money to eat. We just deserved a good service considering I buy my kids Mac and cheese there every other week! So they can at least value me as a customer who spends hundreds of dollars to the restaurant so they can have jobs! MAnager was nice she knew there was something wrong so she approached us. I told her I don't want any troubles but our server just sucked! Will probably never go back here for my kids mac and cheese or any future pizza or other food! Worst experience ever! No star!

Raina M.,"Las Vegas, NV",192,294,234,4.0,2/24/2013,"Who doesn't love CPK? This restaurant has been around since I was a kid. Unfortunately, there aren't too many locations here in Vegas. They really should consider opening a location away from the strip. What I like about CPK is that they are always consistent. I walk in knowing that I will eat good food and leave happy. Here are some of my favorites: -The original BBQ Chicken Pizza: gotta love this classic. Always comes out hot and delicious!  -Spinach Artichoke Dip: I have ordered this dish at many restaurants, but CPK has the best one. Its very smooth, creamy, and easy to dip! -Garlic Cream Fettuccine with Chicken: another classic that I love. The sauce is thick and full of flavor, which is how I like my pastas! -California Club Sandwich: I ordered this a couple of times when I lived in California and I remember it being surprisingly good. I think the herb cheese focaccia bread was very tasty. -Avocado Club Egg Rolls: I have never tried this, but my husband loves them. One dish you might want to stay away from is the Crispy Mac N' Cheese. We ordered it when the new small plates menu came out. It sounded interesting because they use Panko, but it was very cold and the cheese was flavorless.  Service has always been pretty good and attentive.

I almost never order salmon out anyway, and that's probably not going to sway me. For a informal business lunch, it works just fine here. The tortilla soup has a bit of bit, and a good deal of flavor. CPK has always been a soup-place for some, and I was happy to dive in myself.  A Cobb salad, I think, is what I had next. Perfectly fine, if not terribly robust. The chunks of turkey/chicken were a presence in the salad, but really didn't stand out. The avocado made itself better known, and that was fine. The shredded Romaine was adequate, if not terribly flavorful. Nice chill atmosphere in the middle of a very busy Mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas?start=80

Sometimes you have to ask for it if you go by yourself though. Also, you absolutely must try the buttercake with icescream. For being a pizza place they have awesome desserts!

I gave our waitress $40 as I wanted change for a tip. When she returned the change, I received only $19, no coins.  Although it was only $.27 I thought it has fallen out of the folder she placed on the table.  I couldn't get her attention but did reach another server.  When I told her about the coin, her response was, ""Oh, we don't give change; we always round up.""  WHAT????  I said I had never heard of that before and she offered to get our waitress.  When she came over, she reiterated the same message and proceeded to tell me, ""I have worked in 7 different restaurants in Las Vegas.  They are do that.""  I told her also that I had never heard of that.  Her next comment was, ""Most Las Vegas restaurants do it and since you aren't from here, you didn't know."" I have lived in this town for 33 years - about 10 more than she'd been born. I am appalled at this practice.  Do you know how much extra money that rip off from patrons?  No wonder that young lady has been at 7 restaurants - she has probably ripped off a lot of people and got caught.   As a result, I will NEVER eat here again!  Just a matter of principle!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas?start=20

I love CPK mostly, ironically, for its salads, although its pizzas are fine, but the salads are of great variety, always fresh, and always welcome. Moroccan-spiced chicken has long been a favorite. The avocado egg rolls are also a classic they do quite well. The menu here is the standard CPK the world over...but come here to put your feet up and get some VIP treatment after a long day or shopping or trekking the Strip.  This particular CPK has a wonderful staff, in particular the assistant GM, Jamie, who went above and beyond to ensure a quality crew meal for my large party on our work break recently. We called ahead to have food ready for us since we were on a tight schedule and everything was served correctly and fresh. Jamie made fresh coffees and served our every miniscule whim and request, boxing leftovers up herself, running pitchers of water back and forth, and completely winning us over with the ""life-changing"" dessert: warm brown butter cake with vanilla bean ice cream and whipped cream. AN ABSOLUTE MUST-ORDER! The seating here is open to the mall (not in the food court) but comfortable and not exceedingly loud. Very clean. Highly recommended.

We decided to order the Korean BBQ tacos with sweet chili sauce, mushroom pizza, and the works pizza.  Breakdown: The Korean BBQ tacos were the highlight of the meal! The sweet chili sauce perfectly complemented the chunks of meat and greens. The sweet sauce would leave a little kick of spicy after every bite.  The mushroom pizza was average. It satisfied my craving for pizza, but I was not wow-ed by it. Half way through the meal the cheese  wasn't as soft and  had a weird consistency. Half way through the meal I found myself wishing I had tried Grimaldi's next door.  The works pizza definitely was a little bit of everything. It had so many colorful toppings that made it look very appetizing. I was not too big of a fan though, since I don't care for meat on my pizza (veggies all the way!).

When she got there we ordered our food and we waited for that to come to us (which took quite some time because they were busy). After we got our food, we realized it was made incorrect. I told the waitress bring our dressing on the side, but instead she brought the food WITH the dressing on it and salsa on the side (not to mention there was no chicken on it). Soo flagged a manager and she told us to keep that one and would order another one. Well the next one came out semi-correct. It was still missing the chicken! So hour or less then tentative server decided to say that we didn't order it, which was a lie. So we had to wait, yet again for a third pizza which was different. We started to eat it, but our appetites were shot to hell by the time we realized our stupid waitress was messing everything up. Overall, we don't plan to return to this crumby location ever again.

The salad had large chunks of avocado and a fair amount of applewood smoked bacon.  The avocado was ripe and the bacon was crispy.  Maybe next time I will ask to get the blue cheese chunks on the side....

Taken straight from the menu: Spinach fettuccine with chicken, red, green & yellow peppers, red onions and fresh cilantro in a tequila-lime and jalapeño cream sauce.

The ingredients they use are like the quintessential ingredients of early 90's California. Stuff like sun-dried tomatoes and broccolini. Like, oh my god!

My favorites, besides the impeccable afore mentioned uber pizza, are the Sun-dried tomato and Broccolini Fusilli($13), Tomato Basil Spaghettini ($13; I swear it smells like ganja), and Tuscan Hummus ($8).

At first it was poorly cooked (soggy, the crust was still soft with some dough) and so we had them return it. The gentleman was kind enough to return in and made us a brand new one, crisp to perfection. It's no five start pizza, but the pizza was tasty and the service was great.

I like coming here for their flatbreads and fresh salads (especially after eating rice for 5 straight days!). We got the mushroom and spinach flatbread ($5), bbq chicken salad ($10), and the fish tacos ($13.99). I like the flavors of their salads bc of the numerous ingredients they use. Their flatbreads are a good value for two people. However, I wouldn't order the fish tacos again. The fish portion was too small and the dish overall is not worth the price (It came with just chips and salsa). Overall, I think CPK is one of the good chain restos out there if you're looking for simple food but with interesting flavors.....or if you want a break from rice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas?start=100

Kirstie M.,"Las Vegas, NV",215,268,1110,4.0,6/13/2012,"I've been a CPK fan ever since I lived in Hong Kong. I remember taking the time off with my family after church to enjoy their garlic cream fettucine which we did again a couple of nights ago. In addition to that, we had an order of their roasted garlic chicken pizza as well as their classic caesar's salad.  Every experience here brings in an aura of nostalgia. The food tasted exactly the same as it did back in Hong Kong around 2008, down to the very last detail. And by that, I mean the food is very flavorful and rich. Mind you, the garlic fettucine tends to get a little oily so with my mom's gallstone concerns, I had to limit the amount she was taking in or else it would cause a stomach upset (bilary cholic is what they call it if memory serves me well)  Aside from that, this is a good place to hang out after a long day of walking around the mall. They're pretty family-oriented too. The table next to us was a family of 3 with a cute little girl and she was given some crayons and coloring sheets for her enjoyment. She doodled her way through dinner and looked like she had a lot of fun. Staff is friendly and you have the choice whether to eat inside or outside - where you could watch people walk by.

Aljamin S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",463,104,291,3.0,12/1/2010,"Inside the fabulous Fashion Show Mall on the corner of Spring Mountain and Las Vegas Boulevard, the CPK here keeps you safe from the outdoor wind chills and cools you down from the blazing hot summer days. One of my favorite parts about this particular one is that you get to people watch while you eat. When I was working inside the Fashion Show mall, I would order lunch ahead of time by calling it in and picking it up (fast, great service!) and some days, I would order it ahead of time and lounge on a table and people while enjoying lunch. It's kind of redundant to place in a review for a pizza chain like CPK, but the reason why I chose to review this place was not only to share my own experiences, but to let out-of-towners know WHY they should eat at this particular one. It's like decyphering the business owner's reasons why (not counting the placement for revenue inside one of the busier malls in Las Vegas, haha!). So here's what I love to order from here: CHINESE CHICKEN SALAD: is my favorite salad of all time and I like to order it when I got to different places. Hard to say that CPK is the best one (I make the best one :P) but it's my favorite from the menu. Sometimes the lettuce could be a bit fresher, but when it is fresh? YUM! TUSCAN HUMMUS: deh-lish-isssss! I can eat an entire bucket of this hummus! It's soo addicting! I usually order this and a salad and I'm good to go for a few hours. This is the reason why I ventured out to try different hummuses outside of CPK! ITALIAN PIZZA (discontinued pizza, wahh!): I remember speaking to one of the servers and they broke the heartbreaking news to me! :'( My girlfriend's sister is the one who introduced me to this one and it became my favorite! The ingredients missing from the replacement pizza (Mushroom, Pepperoni, Sausage pizza) is the peppers that lit up the pizza. If I remember correctly, they changed the sausages too! :( Major disappointment! I'm a semi-health nut so I order on the honey wheat with whole grain crust! 3 stars because it isn't super different from the others, deducted for the change of menu and average service from the staff but cool points for having ordered from the phone and never having to wait ridiculous amounts of time. Would I come back? Yeah, I'm actually thinking about it right now! NEW ITEMS ON THE MENU TOO! Korean BBQ tacos?! .......to be continued!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas?start=140
Cameron M.,"Las Vegas, NV",116,35,21,5.0,4/9/2011,"If you've eaten at one CPK, you've eaten at them all. Honestly I feel that writing a review for a particular location of a popular franchise is repeating the facts stated in the other reviews (with slight variations of opinion and specific experiences). Well, now that I've already defined how this review is supposed to go....  The food is always good whenever I hit this place up. I've never had an issue with their service or the wait times. Their location is deep inside of the mall, so strip wanderers may never make it in this far. The establishment is nice and clean - though smaller than most CPKs that I've been to. Yadda yadda... There's just one thing that stands out the most for me - the frosted mugs. YESSIR, THEM FROSTED MUGS AT THE BAR! Every single time I've ordered a beer, the mug is nice and frosted - the top of the head slightly frozen over. I can't find a spot in the mall that serves a beer better than this place. Of course El Segundo, Stripburger, and RA have full service bars with larger drink selection - but bam, this CPK wins my heart over with their frosted mugs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas?start=140

They are a bit pricey, but you can get the full sized (2 meals in one), or knock a few bucks off for half - the perfect lunch. They have such a fun creative array of options and toppings, like this one:  Moroccan-spiced chicken breast with crisp Romaine lettuce, roasted butternut squash, Medjool dates, fresh avocado, toasted almonds, fresh beets, chopped egg, carrots, dried cranberries and red bell peppers. Tossed with our champagne vinaigrette. DELISH! I typically get the Cobb these days (it's low carb) and they have one of the best Cobbs in town.

Ashley L.,"Las Vegas, NV",28,18,22,2.0,8/17/2012,"this review is for the california pizza kitchen inside the fashion show mall.   first of all.. out of all the california pizza kitchens i've been to, this one has the worst service.  i work inside of the mall so i consider myself a regular here and bad service is something that i find on most of my visits.  when you first walk in, you'll find the chatty hostesses who will talk to their friends in front of you while you stare at them and wait for them to seat you.  most of the waiters/waitresses will take their sweet ass time to get to you and help you with what you need, especially if what you needed was a refill of your drink.  on one occasion, they charged me the wrong amount to my credit card and i had to drive back to CPK just to get it fixed.  on a second occasion, i came with friends and we paid for the bill in twenty dollar bills.. well you know how you're supposed to get change back right? the waiter took our money and DISAPPEARED.  we sat there waiting for 30 minutes for him to return and no one came around.  since it was late and the rest of the mall was closing, we just gave up and left.  even though i got compensated for it by the manager (she's a real sweetheart) when i came around a second time, i gotta warn you guys to be careful when you're paying for your meal.. whether you pay with cash or card.  anyways, as for everything else, the restaurant is clean, the seats aren't cramped, and the portions are a little below average compared to other CPKs (i guess i expect that when i'm dining at the fashion show mall). the food is standard and consistent.  one thing i really recommend is the garlic cream fettuccine.. like seriously its the only thing i order every time i come.  if you've never had it before, its a nice big plate of noodles with a thick white sauce that fills you up good for 10 dollars.  you can add chicken and mushrooms to it for an extra cost, but i don't.  one plate of noodles can be shared between two people for a meal that won't make you feel bloated despite the heavyness of the sauce.  the spaghetti bolognese is good too if you want something tomato-y.  theres a garlic tomato-y spaghetti that they sell that i don't recommend anyone to eat.. unless they enjoy a mouth full of garlic flavor that super minty gum can't remove. the pesto is not my favorite.  the salads here are on the ehh side. for appetizers, the fried macaroni and cheese (it has a fancier name.. but i forgot it) is delicious! but it's on the small side.  it comes with four pieces (my picture only shows two because i have a bad habit of eating my food and then remembering to take a picture) on a plate with cheesy sauce.  as for the pizzas.. i can't say anything about them.  i don't like pizza ):  overall, the food here is just as good as any other california pizza kitchen but i'd rather go to town square or the mirage because the service would be better there. p.s. when they ask you if you want to sit inside or outside, choose INSIDE! from my experience, the service is faster. oh and ask for free bread.  yum! p.p.s i've recently discovered that you get more food with take out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas?start=140
