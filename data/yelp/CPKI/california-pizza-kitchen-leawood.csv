Mel P.,"Lenexa, KS",1,27,15,5.0,9/30/2015,"I had the California club pizza. This was my first time eating there and both the pizza and the staff were excellent. The woman who helped me order was so polite, helpful, and kind. I was really impressed with the service. Also, the guy who made my pizza (and I ordered to go) also helped answer my questions and even brought my pizza out to me where I was sitting. He was even so thoughtful as to put the arugula, avocado, and sauce on the side so the pizza didn't ruin while I took it home with me. I will definitely be coming here again. And I'll order that same pizza again!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood?start=20

Dee B.,"Overland Park, KS",0,60,5,4.0,7/4/2015,"It is a chain but I really like CPK.  The food always is good.  I appreciate the lower calorie options which are sooo good!  They don't taste ""lite"" at all.  I like the staff at the Leawood store.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood?start=20
Consumer C.,"Downtown, Seattle, WA",0,10,,1.0,12/24/2014,The pizza took about 30 minutes to make. It was not good at all. I've had the same pizza at other locations and it was good.

Kay L.,"Overland Park, KS",288,713,91,4.0,9/15/2010,"A taste of California in the Midwest! It's a chain restaurant, so you know what you're going to get... in this case the famous CPK gourmet pizzas & salads.  A favorite from my old OC neighborhood, it translated reasonably well to this location.  Light, open, bright.  (It was pretty noisy on the Friday night that we were there, however, which is the downside of the tile-and-open-space style of decor.)  Service was friendly and attentive, the pizza -- Thai chicken on honey wheat, of course -- was perfectly prepared, soft drinks were refilled promptly.   The parking garage @ Park Place is a little difficult, but they do offer free valet parking for CPK guests.  If you want to cheap out on the tip, park across the street in the Macy's lot & walk over. We'll be back -- CPK in the KC area is like running into an old friend unexpectedly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood?start=20

Tim M.,"Overland Park, KS",78,68,97,3.0,3/26/2012,"Its a chain and for a chain the consistancy is great. The Thai salad is what I get 90% of the time. Add avocado on top and you'll love it even more.  the service seemed rushed. We were weren't half way thru our meal and the waitress was asking us about dessert. Then since we chose not to have to dessert so immediatly ask if it would be 3 checks or one. I guess she was looking to go home early or something.  Overall, I travel a lot and I will search out CPK's because of their consistancy. I get what I order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood?start=20

Christina A.,"Louisburg, KS",0,8,,2.0,5/17/2014,"I'll sum up our experience in two words: NEVER AGAIN. Now the specifics: We arrived at Park Place with intention of eating at BurgerFi. When we got there, it was super crowded, and no tables were available. My husband is disabled, so the two of us and our 10 year old daughter opted to give CPK a try, since standing and eating while we waited for a table to open up isn't a possibility.  We were seated promptly, which was nice. The decor was typical for a mid-range casual dining restaurant, and it was clean. Our server arrived with a trainee, took our drink orders, and asked if we had been there before. We said no, but that kind of went ignored. The server exuded apathy, and didn't offer any suggestions or ask if we were interested in an appetizer. It was pretty obvious he just didn't want to be there. He did explain that all of the pizzas were the same size, 10 inches.  Looking at the menu, the pizza choices seemed like they would be good, and we opted to have the BBQ chicken pizza on hand tossed crust, and the Meat Cravers thin crust pizza. As we waited we were brought a small plate of bread with olive oil and herbs for dipping. It was okay.  Then, the pizza arrived.  INCREDIBLY disappointed. On the BBQ Chicken pizza, there MAY have been a total of three ounces of chicken on the whole pizza, and the cheese was nearly non existent. The Meat Cravers was the same way, with the added bonus of TONS of grease. Gross.  If you want a pizza with good flavor from a place that doesn't skimp on toppings, head to Minsky's. If you want beautiful and unusual artisanal pizzas that satisfy, go to SPIN. Skip this place. It is overpriced and underwhelming. For what we spent today on mediocre food and service, we could have had something much better. I'm giving two stars because our drinks were never empty; otherwise, I would have given one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood?start=20
Jules H.,"Greenwood, MO",219,26,3,2.0,4/28/2014,"The decor feels like a Perkins. I didn't like that my beer came in a can. Not classy, just pour it in a glass. I asked for a side of pizza sauce and was brought about a tablespoon and was charged $1 for it, ridiculous! Over priced, mediocre food. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood?start=20
Debbie F.,"Overland Park, KS",88,101,4,5.0,6/14/2014,"Keisha took great care of us tonight.  Another gentleman, who I presume to be the manager, was extremely helpful, too.  Since he encouraged us to sign up with their app (Pizza Dough), we scored a free small plate! While we tried to figure out what we wanted to order, Keisha brought us some bread with olive oil and a phenomenal seasoning.  Quite tasty! We decided on the Tortilla Spring rolls (Mediterranean and Thai Chicken) that were very good! For the free small plate, my husband and I shared a wedge salad.  Thankfully, Keisha was able to bring a bit more dressing for the salad because it had very little dressing on it.  Deciding on the Father's Day Special, we enjoyed Creamy Garlic Fettuccine with chicken and my husband ordered the Thai Crunch salad (YuK!) BUT he LOVED it! I don't like Peanut dressing and he does. The Key LIme pie was so very good! This was a ton of food, so we had a generous portion to take back for kids to enjoy.  We had a really nice time at CPK.  The food was great! And the service was very customer-focused.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood?start=20
Trevor Z.,"Harrisonville, MO",0,7,1,2.0,3/15/2015,So far off to a bad start. Got seated and was here almost 10 min before anyone helped us. We were sat at a table that wasn't bused or wiped off. 3 different waiters walked passed us and not one asked us if we had been helped. Then 2 guys stood at the terminal just shooting the breeze both looking at us while talking neither one taking the initiative. The bartender yelling back and forth amongst the staff which is just ridiculous. Finally had a guy ask if we needed anything or been helped I said no one has been at the table. He takes our drink order then immediately walks to the hostess to engage in a conversation then off to get the drinks which was just water. If the food is poor I will add an addendum. If nothing added food was good. We shall see.....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood?start=20
Clayton R.,"Denver, CO",250,217,225,3.0,12/15/2011,"Met a friend for lunch here, and was seated right away in a comfy booth near the door so my friend could see me.  Once she arrived, we took a look at the menu, and she mentioned the BLT pizza, which looked pretty amazing.  I asked the waiter for his favorites, and he mentioned the Chipotle and Sicilian.  Being from St. Louis, I went for the thin crust Sicilian.   It was great!!  Crisp crust, spicy, plentiful toppings and a great overall flavor.  The edges were black, but I just snapped them off.  Overall, it was a really good pizza.  The only reason CPK doesn't get more stars is the price.  I'm not afraid to pay money for unique fare, and I do so on a regular basis.  However, for a large scale chain that has shops across the country, $14 for a 10-ish inch thin crust pizza was just a little much.  Sure, it was a good pizza, but I could buy two pizzas from Dominos, or (gasp!) four Jack's pizzas from Hen House! (please ingest last sentence with sarcasm intended). The pizza is great, and for the price it is an ok place.  I don't think the pizza could be split between two adults, unless they were light eaters.  Maybe an adult and a child could split one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood?start=20
Bill P.,"Holmes Beach, FL",0,2,,1.0,8/1/2013,"I normally enjoy CPK.  I try to resist pizza but when i can no longer resist I will look for a CPK.  i am rating this location very low due to poor service.  I took my wife to a late lunch. We discussed what we would order and were looking forward to trying the butter cake after some salad and pizza.  After sitting for 10 minutes, and they were not that busy, we began to lose patience since nobody had even taken our drink order.  We tried getting the attention of one of the servers without success.  After another 10 minutes we walked out.  I mentioned to the host we were leaving since we could not get anyone to serve us and he did not seem interested.  I will visit CPK in the future but not this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood?start=20
Zach G.,"Olathe, KS",173,1128,221,3.0,7/16/2012,"Food and service wise, my visit to this CPK was exactly how I expected it. Friendly, efficient service and decent, specialty pizza. Everyone knows what to expect from a CPK pizza - it's good, and a bit different, but it won't be the best pizza you will ever have by any means. That's fine by me...I knew what I was going to get when I went in.  The thing I hate about this location is the layout. It's really open and has a diner feel to it - tables are practically stacked upon each other, and if it's busy (as it was when I was there), it is ridiculously and annoyingly loud. For the price they charge for a pizza, you'd think they could take out just a few tables and make it a more comfortable, quieter dining room...but apparently not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood?start=20
Beth B.,"Overland Park, KS",138,286,18,3.0,5/31/2012,"i came here for lunch today with 2 coworkers. I was not in the mood for pizza - as I had just had Shakespeare's from CoMo (best pizza in the world) earlier in the week. Plus, their pizzas were $11 and $12 which seemed kind of pricey to me.  I asked the server what salads he recommended and he said the BBQ chicken and Crispy Thai salads were the most popular. I had the Crispy Thai salad (1/2 order) for about $9.50. It was really good. It was just a bit more than I could finish. The salad had pieces of chicken and edamame and was really good. It has a Thai peanut sauce and lime-cilantro combo dressing which keeps the peanut sauce from being so thick and overwhelming. Once again, seemed a bit pricey, but the food was excellent. My coworkers ordered a pepperoni pizza and a fried club appetizer. Neither looked all that good to me, but to each their own. Our server was great. He came to our table shortly after we sat down, took our drink and food order at the same time, promptly brought out our drinks and made sure our drinks were never empty. It took a little while to get our food, but it was nothing crazy. We were in and out within an hour.  I would definitely come back for that salad. Not sure I would come for pizza. I think you get a better deal at Spin! with their lunch special.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood?start=20

Just kidding, California Pizza Kitchen is obviously a pizza place and Italian in cuisine.  They have a vast selection of pies, from traditional to creative and slightly off the wall.  The one thing they all have in common is that they are flavorful and delicious.  I have always enjoyed the pizza when I have gone to California Pizza Kitchen and I have always gone home with leftovers.  I recommend the works, which is my favorite pie and if you're ever curious as to whether or not you'll order too much -go ahead and order it-  because nothing tastes better for breakfast the next morning than cold pizza, especially from the California Pizza Kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood?start=40

Ashley P.,"Kansas City, MO",32,45,7,3.0,4/14/2008,"I like this location better than the one at the Plaza. I don't know what it is -- perhaps this location has a much more natural light than the one on the Plaza. Maybe it's because it doesn't feel quite so uppity than the Plaza location... I've eaten at California Pizza Kitchen a few times. Once in L.A. and then a couple times at the Plaza and now this new Leawood location just today. The food has always been good, but I'm not as impressed with it as most people are. The large variety of pizzas is a big plus, I suppose, but I'm really simple -- just give me pepperoni and I'll be happy. A coworker, at lunch today, ordered the California Club pizza: tons of lettuce and fresh avocado and some bacon and chicken. I've never thought a combination of pizza and club sandwich would be good, but maybe it works. Two other coworkers ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza (which they both loved).  Since I'd eaten pizza last night for dinner, I tried the Pesto Cream Penne (a new item on the menu) and it was delicious. That might become my ""regular.""  Service was so-so.

BBQ chicken pizza!  gourmet fussy pizza! not for me never! so a couple years ago i was at the Beauty Brands on the plaza for a late hair appointment and parked next to the one right there, having the choice of eating much much later as traffic as always was backed up on Ward Parkway i stopped in for a gourmet fussy pizza and Loved it.  Living in Overland Park now I'm not going to be driving forever when i can get plenty of good food nearby. I was happy to see that there was a brand new location at Park Place in Leawood, hopefully Johnson County's answer to Legends and Zona Rosa, i read the reviews and was disapointed, but once again coming from a hair appointment i thought i'd take a chance and try it anyway and my experience was MUCH better, i really had a good time i ate at the bar, my food was excellent and i watched them shovel pizzas in and out of the oven,  Bartender was friendly and attentive and i was more than satisfied with my pizza choices, my problem when i sat down, was not being able to decide which one to order the Bartender was helpful instead of annoyed he helped me narrow my stomach cravings down to pick the santa fe chicken pizza which i really loved and even made sure i was happy with my choice,  all in all I'm glad California Pizza Kitchen is at Park Place which is just beautiful to even drive around in I'm looking forward to see what else they will build in the Nall area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood?start=40

They put corn in the quac & it adds that extra little fresh flavor. The salads that are offered alongside of the tasty pizza classics are fresh & packed with the freshest most delectable toppings!

Lindsay C.,"Overland Park, KS",105,36,67,4.0,2/6/2015,"I've been to CPK a couple of times before, but it was many years ago in Chicago. I work in an office at Park Place and my team and I came here for a lunch meeting last week. It was a very cold day so we asked to be seated in one of the sunny booths and were very happy with our table. A couple of us got iced tea to drink and I was disappointed by the fact that our glasses were SO full of ice that our server was constantly having to refill them with tea. The complimentary bread with oil and seasoning was hot and delicious.  Three of us ordered salads, with the fourth getting one of the pasta dishes. I had the half sized Thai Crunch salad (would've gotten the full size but we made the mistake of looking up calorie/fat contents first and I couldn't deal with that guilt!).  I was a bit disappointed at just how small my ""half"" salad was but it was my choice to forgo the full. There's a reason that salad is considered one of their ""favorite"" items on the menu--it's probably the best salad I've ever had. SO SO good. It makes me want to go to the gym a few extra days some week soon just so I can get the full thing!

J. Geoff S.,"Kansas City, MO",17,38,3,5.0,11/1/2014,"This review is about this location and the company over all over more than a year of experiences with them. My first visit was on a whim.  I ordered the roasted veggie sandwich but was put off by the lack of a vegetarian option to go with the sandwich (Cesar salad is not vegetarian.)  I asked the waitress to sub the roasted veggie salad, she said she'd check on it, and let me know.  She ends up bringing me the sandwich with the salad.  I thought it was all very good.  She was super friendly, and the friend I was with even thought she was great and was impressed with her service. But they ended up charging me for the salad by mistake, forgetting I asked to sub it.  No problem, they comped it off, all was well, first world crisis averted. I took to CPK's Facebook page, not out of anger over the situation, but to suggest they do something about their menu options with sides for the sandwiches.  For a place that touts they cater to both vegetarians and vegans, they really need to find a vegetarian side to go with the sandwich. They not only apologized by they went above and beyond what I expected and gave me a $40.00 gift certificate! I used the gift certificate once after getting it, and that was on the roasted veggie salad.  I tucked the gift certificate away until my family came for a visit, we went there on a Saturday afternoon, I gave the waiter my gift certificate, but then he came back and said there was nothing on there.  The only thing it had been used for was on the price of one roasted veggie salad, this was impossible.  But it was my word against theirs.  I had no proof of use of what I used it for, I was totally at their mercy. We wait there for quite some time while they try to contact somebody at the corporate office, but they couldn't get anybody on the weekend.   The manager ends up honoring it for what I estimated was left on the certificate, which was around $26.00.  She said they would contact me if they had any problems with using the certificate after they contacted corporate on Saturday.  The food here is over all solid.  Not every meal I've had pops for me, they still need to develop some decent side options to the sandwiches, but it's a pizza place first and foremost, I get it sandwich and a good side isn't their driving factor.  The food: Four stars at best.  Yes, I am a fan.  Management and staff have always been excellent when I have gone here, about as good as it gets!  WOOHOO!  FIVE STARS! Ignore the haters, this place may not have the best food in Kansas City, but you get a solid meal for your money, and they treat you well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood

No apology offered.  Food quality was exceptional. When I voiced my concerns to our server she copped an attitude and skipped over the chance to apologize or make up for her mistakes.

By late I mean 9 PM and most of the restaurants in the area were already closed. California pizza kitchen closes at 10 PM so we figured we could get in for a quick bite.  We were seated immediately, we were the only other people in the restaurant, besides a table of four. There were a couple of servers that were already cleaning the restaurant for the evening, and the kitchen staff looked like they had started cleaning up for the evening as well. The manager came over and had no problem seating us. He was very enthusiastic and more than willing to seat us and serve us for the evening. Our waiter came over and took our drink orders and appetizer order. I mentioned that I had a food allergy and wanted to know if a couple of the items were alright for me to eat. He went and had the manager come over with a binder full of recipes that had all the allergens listed. I was extremely impressed that the waiter and the manager were eager to come over and help me figure out what on the menu I could have. The manager said they could make almost anything I wanted and that they would be careful when preparing the food.  Two of our friends had small plates and soup and salad to share. Hubby had a club sandwich, and I went with the pork tacos. The food was extremely good, I was very impressed with how quickly it came out and how delicious it was.  Not once did we feel rushed and in fact the waiter came back over and asked if we wanted dessert. I had one friend order the butter cake to go.

Christina A.,"Louisburg, United States",0,8,,2.0,17/5/2014,"I'll sum up our experience in two words: NEVER AGAIN. Now the specifics: We arrived at Park Place with intention of eating at BurgerFi. When we got there, it was super crowded, and no tables were available. My husband is disabled, so the two of us and our 10 year old daughter opted to give CPK a try, since standing and eating while we waited for a table to open up isn't a possibility.  We were seated promptly, which was nice. The decor was typical for a mid-range casual dining restaurant, and it was clean. Our server arrived with a trainee, took our drink orders, and asked if we had been there before. We said no, but that kind of went ignored. The server exuded apathy, and didn't offer any suggestions or ask if we were interested in an appetizer. It was pretty obvious he just didn't want to be there. He did explain that all of the pizzas were the same size, 10 inches.  Looking at the menu, the pizza choices seemed like they would be good, and we opted to have the BBQ chicken pizza on hand tossed crust, and the Meat Cravers thin crust pizza. As we waited we were brought a small plate of bread with olive oil and herbs for dipping. It was okay.  Then, the pizza arrived.  INCREDIBLY disappointed. On the BBQ Chicken pizza, there MAY have been a total of three ounces of chicken on the whole pizza, and the cheese was nearly non existent. The Meat Cravers was the same way, with the added bonus of TONS of grease. Gross.  If you want a pizza with good flavor from a place that doesn't skimp on toppings, head to Minsky's. If you want beautiful and unusual artisanal pizzas that satisfy, go to SPIN. Skip this place. It is overpriced and underwhelming. For what we spent today on mediocre food and service, we could have had something much better. I'm giving two stars because our drinks were never empty; otherwise, I would have given one.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood?start=20

While we tried to figure out what we wanted to order, Keisha brought us some bread with olive oil and a phenomenal seasoning.  Quite tasty! We decided on the Tortilla Spring rolls (Mediterranean and Thai Chicken) that were very good! For the free small plate, my husband and I shared a wedge salad.  Thankfully, Keisha was able to bring a bit more dressing for the salad because it had very little dressing on it.  Deciding on the Father's Day Special, we enjoyed Creamy Garlic Fettuccine with chicken and my husband ordered the Thai Crunch salad (YuK!) BUT he LOVED it! I don't like Peanut dressing and he does. The Key LIme pie was so very good!

I asked the server what salads he recommended and he said the BBQ chicken and Crispy Thai salads were the most popular. I had the Crispy Thai salad (1/2 order) for about $9.50. It was really good. It was just a bit more than I could finish. The salad had pieces of chicken and edamame and was really good. It has a Thai peanut sauce and lime-cilantro combo dressing which keeps the peanut sauce from being so thick and overwhelming. Once again, seemed a bit pricey, but the food was excellent. My coworkers ordered a pepperoni pizza and a fried club appetizer. Neither looked all that good to me, but to each their own. Our server was great. He came to our table shortly after we sat down, took our drink and food order at the same time, promptly brought out our drinks and made sure our drinks were never empty.

Michelle G.,"Omaha, United States",49,404,2,4.0,21/5/2008,"Living in La 6 years all i ever heard about was California Pizza kitchen its so good you need to try it insert wah wah noise of Peanuts adults talking here.    being the stubborn person that i am i refused to go anytime friends asked me and on purpose would go out of the way to avoid this chain on my own and i went to every excellent restuarant from Burbank to Woodland Hills when i lived in the Valley. BBQ chicken pizza!  gourmet fussy pizza! not for me never! so a couple years ago i was at the Beauty Brands on the plaza for a late hair appointment and parked next to the one right there, having the choice of eating much much later as traffic as always was backed up on Ward Parkway i stopped in for a gourmet fussy pizza and Loved it.  Living in Overland Park now I'm not going to be driving forever when i can get plenty of good food nearby. I was happy to see that there was a brand new location at Park Place in Leawood, hopefully Johnson County's answer to Legends and Zona Rosa, i read the reviews and was disapointed, but once again coming from a hair appointment i thought i'd take a chance and try it anyway and my experience was MUCH better, i really had a good time i ate at the bar, my food was excellent and i watched them shovel pizzas in and out of the oven,  Bartender was friendly and attentive and i was more than satisfied with my pizza choices, my problem when i sat down, was not being able to decide which one to order the Bartender was helpful instead of annoyed he helped me narrow my stomach cravings down to pick the santa fe chicken pizza which i really loved and even made sure i was happy with my choice,  all in all I'm glad California Pizza Kitchen is at Park Place which is just beautiful to even drive around in I'm looking forward to see what else they will build in the Nall area.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood?start=40
Crystal C.,"Lathrop, United States",86,156,33,4.0,1/10/2017,I can't deny it.. I'm a straight CPF fan! My boss has catered in from this location several times. Each time I'm more impressed by the flavors. My favorite thus far is the Thai chicken pizza! I could eat a whole one by myself. Recently I was surprised by their quac which was birthing short of delicious! They put corn in the quac & it adds that extra little fresh flavor. The salads that are offered alongside of the tasty pizza classics are fresh & packed with the freshest most delectable toppings! Oh you like bacon in your salad? How about we throw whole slices of crispy bacon in! Fresh beets! Boiled eggs! Blue cheese! I just can't get enough. Can't wait for our next CPK experience!,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood
Pam T.,"Overland Park, United States",123,299,621,4.0,26/10/2016,"I organized a group lunch with my coworkers and picked CPK. Really convenient to the businesses near the Sprint Campus.  Although we came in during peek hours, they were able to quickly accommodate 8 of us with prompt customer service.  A little disappointed with the limited lunch menu. Regular items are a bit pricey for lunch. I ended up ordering from their regular menu and tried the Jamaican Jerk pizza, small plate wedge salad and peach lemonade. All were very good.  There were a few folks in my group that had issues with redeeming a free birthday desert through their app. Russ, the manager on duty, swiftly took action and made it right. Exceptional service all around from Russ throughout our entire dining experience :)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood

I thought it was very kind for the manager to come over and thank us for choosing the restaurant for our large gathering and gave us some complimentary appetizers while we waited for the entire party to arrive. The food is pretty standard across the chain, but the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff put this place above and beyond the others.  There's a parking garage right next door, so parking is never an issue, and in the evening the tiny shopping center (directly next to it) is a cute place to stroll before or after you eat!

After a tasty chicken lettuce wrap appetizer,  I was daring and ordered a vegetable pizza they had with broccoli which was just okay.(That's what happens when I try to be healthy!) However, their thin crust pizza with spin dip was excellent! I will come back just for this item. I enjoyed the fresh Parmesan too...don't forget to ask for it. I love a good whole wheat crust but our waiter strongly recommended their regular crust...maybe next time!

We tried the crispy Mac 'n Cheese bites as a small plate/appetizer & it was so good. I could have made a meal of that if it came in a larger size. The service has been lack luster on this &a other visits. We did have the manager tag our table a couple times to check in but just towards the beginning. I realized after a bit that my husband's tea had been refilled several times but no one had bothered to ask if I wanted any more. I do enjoy the food but I always forget it's there.

Lindsay C.,"Overland Park, United States",105,36,67,4.0,6/2/2015,"I've been to CPK a couple of times before, but it was many years ago in Chicago. I work in an office at Park Place and my team and I came here for a lunch meeting last week. It was a very cold day so we asked to be seated in one of the sunny booths and were very happy with our table. A couple of us got iced tea to drink and I was disappointed by the fact that our glasses were SO full of ice that our server was constantly having to refill them with tea. The complimentary bread with oil and seasoning was hot and delicious.  Three of us ordered salads, with the fourth getting one of the pasta dishes. I had the half sized Thai Crunch salad (would've gotten the full size but we made the mistake of looking up calorie/fat contents first and I couldn't deal with that guilt!).  I was a bit disappointed at just how small my ""half"" salad was but it was my choice to forgo the full. There's a reason that salad is considered one of their ""favorite"" items on the menu--it's probably the best salad I've ever had. SO SO good. It makes me want to go to the gym a few extra days some week soon just so I can get the full thing! It was a bit on the expensive side, but I'll still be back in the future.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood
J. Geoff S.,"Kansas City, United States",17,38,3,5.0,1/11/2014,"This review is about this location and the company over all over more than a year of experiences with them. My first visit was on a whim.  I ordered the roasted veggie sandwich but was put off by the lack of a vegetarian option to go with the sandwich (Cesar salad is not vegetarian.)  I asked the waitress to sub the roasted veggie salad, she said she'd check on it, and let me know.  She ends up bringing me the sandwich with the salad.  I thought it was all very good.  She was super friendly, and the friend I was with even thought she was great and was impressed with her service. But they ended up charging me for the salad by mistake, forgetting I asked to sub it.  No problem, they comped it off, all was well, first world crisis averted. I took to CPK's Facebook page, not out of anger over the situation, but to suggest they do something about their menu options with sides for the sandwiches.  For a place that touts they cater to both vegetarians and vegans, they really need to find a vegetarian side to go with the sandwich. They not only apologized by they went above and beyond what I expected and gave me a $40.00 gift certificate! I used the gift certificate once after getting it, and that was on the roasted veggie salad.  I tucked the gift certificate away until my family came for a visit, we went there on a Saturday afternoon, I gave the waiter my gift certificate, but then he came back and said there was nothing on there.  The only thing it had been used for was on the price of one roasted veggie salad, this was impossible.  But it was my word against theirs.  I had no proof of use of what I used it for, I was totally at their mercy. We wait there for quite some time while they try to contact somebody at the corporate office, but they couldn't get anybody on the weekend.   The manager ends up honoring it for what I estimated was left on the certificate, which was around $26.00.  She said they would contact me if they had any problems with using the certificate after they contacted corporate on Saturday.  The food here is over all solid.  Not every meal I've had pops for me, they still need to develop some decent side options to the sandwiches, but it's a pizza place first and foremost, I get it sandwich and a good side isn't their driving factor.  The food: Four stars at best.  Yes, I am a fan.  Management and staff have always been excellent when I have gone here, about as good as it gets!  WOOHOO!  FIVE STARS! Ignore the haters, this place may not have the best food in Kansas City, but you get a solid meal for your money, and they treat you well.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood
Dawn C.,"Overland Park, United States",110,345,118,3.0,25/10/2013,"Went for lunch with the office crew, service was really slow.  Towards the end we were all fidgety and looking at our watches and our server was M.I.A. so we had to ask another one to help us check  out so we could leave.   Seating area is comfortable and though it's a big wide open space it still feels like you can a conversion without everyone around you being involved in it!   I've been a fan of CPK for years, but this was my first visit to a Kansas City location.  I'm not sure quite what was missing, but the BBQ Chicken Pizza fell flat for me this time.  However, I was very surprised with the carmelized peach salad!  Wowie!  Sweet warm carmelized peaches tossed with field greens, spinach, cranberries, gorgonzola, pecans and a balsamic dressing.  A half salad was plenty generous for me.  Try it, it's quite good!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood
Em B.,"Overland Park, United States",1,19,,2.0,6/8/2015,I couldn't figure out why the hostess seated my group right next to another full table when the restaurant wasn't even half full. Perhaps she bought we would enjoy the noise to go along with the table which was covered with Parmesan cheese. Poor service from the waitress. We got our meal BEFORE the appetizer was delivered. No apology offered.  Food quality was exceptional. When I voiced my concerns to our server she copped an attitude and skipped over the chance to apologize or make up for her mistakes. Instead she made excuses and tried to say none of it was her fault.  They actually deserve one star but because the food was tasty I'll give two.  Probably won't be back.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood

Kim N.,"Lenexa, United States",158,630,50,4.0,21/3/2014,"It was late when we decided we needed to eat before going home after a night of painting and drinking across the street at Pinots and pallets. By late I mean 9 PM and most of the restaurants in the area were already closed. California pizza kitchen closes at 10 PM so we figured we could get in for a quick bite.  We were seated immediately, we were the only other people in the restaurant, besides a table of four. There were a couple of servers that were already cleaning the restaurant for the evening, and the kitchen staff looked like they had started cleaning up for the evening as well. The manager came over and had no problem seating us. He was very enthusiastic and more than willing to seat us and serve us for the evening. Our waiter came over and took our drink orders and appetizer order. I mentioned that I had a food allergy and wanted to know if a couple of the items were alright for me to eat. He went and had the manager come over with a binder full of recipes that had all the allergens listed. I was extremely impressed that the waiter and the manager were eager to come over and help me figure out what on the menu I could have. The manager said they could make almost anything I wanted and that they would be careful when preparing the food.  Two of our friends had small plates and soup and salad to share. Hubby had a club sandwich, and I went with the pork tacos. The food was extremely good, I was very impressed with how quickly it came out and how delicious it was.  Not once did we feel rushed and in fact the waiter came back over and asked if we wanted dessert. I had one friend order the butter cake to go. We received our checks, paid, spoke with the manager about random things, and felt very welcome there. we will be returning soon.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood
