Kate M.,"Westland, MI",24,5,,5.0,12/1/2017,"The asparagus spinach spaghettini is currently off the menu (please bring it back!) but when asked, the Livonia store was happy to make it for me. It didn't come out as planned with an oil and garlic sauce but more of an Alfredo and while I was willing to try it, they were all about making it right and did a do-over on the House. The server and manager really cared that my experience was just right! Great service and food; thank you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-livonia-3
Angela S.,"Westland, MI",77,119,386,4.0,6/12/2016,"I was out at the Laurel Park mall shopping with a friend who wanted to grab a bite to eat. We were both pleased to find that California Pizza Kitchen was conveniently located near Carsons.  The mall was closing but the restaurant is open an hour beyond the mall hours until 10pm on the weekends. We were greeted by a jovial host who sat us immediately. Our server appeared instantly taking our order and was very attentive throughout our visit, checking in on us frequently. My friend ordered CPK's original bbq chicken pizza and raved about it. She also tried the sangria flights which consisted of generous samples of three different kinds of sangria offerings. I ordered the hearth roasted halibut which is prepared on a cedar plank and accompanied by grilled asparagus, butternut squash farro and baby kale. It was exceptional!!  If you're ever in the Livonia area or shopping at or near Laurel Park and want to try a restaurant with a nice atmosphere and good service, check out CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-livonia-3
Suzanne S.,"Canton, MI",640,203,399,5.0,12/1/2016,"OH my goodness! I must say that I love going to eat at this place. Just about every time we visit, I'm a happy ""camper"". But this visit specifically now, I will tell you about. I went with my hubby for dinner. I ordered the Marguerita pizza and my husband got the Pear and Gorgonzola pizza. I had the best dinner in so long. It was just so yummy! The Marguerita pizza was a crunchy thin crust and cooked ""just so"". I asked for it to be ""not too soft or too burnt"". It came to me perfectly! The cheese and the taste of it was just awesome! This visit they had the Pumpkin cheesecake that I wait for each year. I was too full to get it this visit and thought that ""I'll just wait until a few weeks and come back and get it next time. They carry it from about Halloween through Christmas and the New Year. But sadly, the next visit when I went back, they were all out of it to my sadness. But I should have got it during this visit and I could have even brought it home!  Well, this time, my husband got his favorite pizza too. His is the Pear and Gorgonzola cheese pizza. He loves that one and swears by it to everyone! The server was awesome kind and she did a great job of keeping my soda full ....she got my order regarding the crust, just perfect. The manager even stopped by our table and he was really nice too! They put us near the window and I asked for that spot! Isn't that nice when they don't complain or raise eyebrows at you for asking something simple like that? They just treated us very well and we had a great time with wonderful food! We'll be back and I am hoping to snag some of that delectable Pumpkin cheesecake that they're famous for...See ya soon California Pizza Kitchen at Laurel Park Mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-livonia-3
Jeff W.,"Dearborn, MI",26,52,63,3.0,5/7/2017,"First time eating here the staff was friendly and establishment clean. I had the margarita thin crust pizza with chicken that I added. The pizza was good it had just the right amount of cheese, sauce and toppings. The crust was cooked the way I like it (crispy with a bit of that brick oven toast to it). I give it three stars because after adding the chicken my pizza turned out costing almost twenty dollars which I find to be a bit expensive since you could find a comparable pizza at Blaze or Berra for less.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-livonia-3
Dan M.,"Utica, MI",119,101,20,4.0,9/14/2016,"Have not been to a CPK for a few years and some work friends wanted to grab a bite so I went along for some dinner!  Ordered the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pizza. Chipotle adobo sauce, shaved poblanos and Monterey Jack with housemade roasted corn & black bean salsa, fresh cilantro and tangy lime crema. There were a lot of great flavor combinations here and for the most part I loved this pizza! I consider myself somewhat of a pizza fanatic!  The only change I would make is that if you're going to bill the pizza as spicy use something with a little more heat than shaved poblano peppers. I would have liked a little more spice in the flavor. But overall I really enjoyed this choice.  Restaurant had the same great ambience that I remember and we had a really enjoyable time. Service was quick and attentive which is always nice.

Margaret V.,"Canton, MI",286,1088,186,4.0,6/15/2015,"I had a $10 coupon that was about to expire so I went to Laurel Park to use it.  I had been to the California Pizza Kitchen in Ann Arbor but never the Livonia location.... The Livonia location menu was different than Ann Arbor.  They had a lot of different sandwiches (pulled pork, turkey and brie) that I had never seen at other locations.. I ended up getting a half portion of the Italian Chopped Salad without garbanzo beans.  The amount of food was extremely plentiful.  It would be the perfect amount to split with someone.  There was a lot of lettuce, cheese, chicken and chopped greens.  I would have preferred a little bit more salami.  The dressing on the salad was also plentiful, but a tad on the bland side. I had one of their cranberry coolers (cranberry juice, soda water and lime) and it was outstanding!  Very refreshing. Prices are reasonable.

Brian P.,"Southfield, MI",0,3,,1.0,1/9/2017,"The kitchen looked dirty and the ceiling was flaking around the lights. The bathrooms were dirty as well. Moscow Mule: A copper cup filled to capacity with ice, a splash of ginger beer. Rumor is that there's grey goose vodka but I tasted no alcohol. Real bits of ginger which was nice. NO prices listed on the menu, the surprise cam when the bill arrived. They charge 10 dollars for this mediocre cocktail. it was in reality 10 dollars for a cup of ice. California club pizza: Pizza was bland and piled high with Romain, I'm talking cannot see a pizza because its so  covered in Romain. The avocado was slimy and squishy, a terrible taste and texture to eat. In my opinion should have been tossed out. Fortunately the waitress took it off our bill. Not worth anywhere close to the 15 dollars they charge. Maybe other items on the menu are better, but my meal left my stomach feeling uneasy. For what they charge its a better idea to go to a real restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-livonia-3
Don B.,"South Lyon, MI",0,11,,2.0,6/15/2017,"The pizzas are inventive and the food seems healthy enough compared to others.  However the negatives simply stomp all over the positives.  The pricing is very high, on average 50% more than other local options for lunch of same quality.  The food takes forever to arrive at the table and the waitstaff is indifferent to that fact.  I work near here and on occasion this CPK comes up as a choice, usually length of time since the last visit.  But I regret it each time.  Today, my work group threw in the towel and nixed this place from the rotation.  No loss at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-livonia-3

Deb M.,"Canton, MI",702,315,640,3.0,5/6/2014,"I really love the food here.  The pizza choices are many so that everyone should be able to find something to their liking, whether you are a cheese and pepperoni fan or want something adventurous like a thai chicken pizza.  The salads are fresh and if you're not a pizza fan there are plenty of other choices. So why only 3 stars?  It took us 2+ hours to eat said salad and pizza.  The service was really spotty and I feel like we were stuck in a corner and forgotten.  It was pretty busy and the waitress did say they were short staffed, however, I recall the same service problems on the visit prior to this one.   If you don't mind spending a couple hours at CPK it is a fun choice, especially for  a dining choice at the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-livonia-3

Prices are not half bad and the food is good for a chain restaurant, but the service is usually really bad and I inevitably wind up with a different server after awhile and for no apparent reason. It's always a lot of excuses from the management. I don't get it, CPK does so many things good, really good, then why haven't they upped the ante with regard to service.

Ernie M.,"Northville, MI",42,396,58,3.0,4/28/2013,"CPK has some new pizzas on the menu-----at least new to me. Specifically it is the thin crusted ""Meat Cravers"" pizza. Pepperoni, salami, ham and Italian sausage (Makes you want to get home fast and take your Vytorin pill). It is delicious!!! My wife  enjoyed the Dakota Pea Soup and tortilla Mediterranean spring rolls and said they were great. One of the good things about the CPK is that the pizzas are big enough that you can take some home for lunch or dinner the next day(almost as good as getting Chinese). Our friend with us got the Margherita pizza and loved it and also took half home. The wines are good. I especially like the Nobilo Sauvignon Blanc. The service is almost too fast for one to enjoy a glass of wine and some conversation before dinner, but Stefanie did a nice job of timing things just right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-livonia-3?start=20

Kerry N.,"Livonia, MI",5,17,,2.0,3/24/2015,"CPK is a standard go-to for my family and I, but this was an exceptionally lackluster visit.  My sister and I stopped in around 3:45 this past Saturday and had the most minimal service.  I expect this was because of a shift change.  There was no host, eventually a server greeted us and sat us.  We were seated without silverware, drink menu, or small plates menu though (to my knowledge that is the standard menu setup).  Another server came over in ..roughly 5 minutes (it seemed like quite some time) to ask us about drinks.  We ordered a bottle of Pelligrino (with limes) to split but that took another 10 minutes (?) to bring over.  The server that dropped off the Pelligrino brought two dirty glasses and no limes and left.  She quite literally just dropped off those items at the table and then we saw her headed to her car in the parking lot.  It was some time before a server actually came over to get our order.  Once we were able to order, things went more smoothly.  The food was good, the server was able to replace our glasses and bring us limes, and the meal was fine from there on out.  We noticed most of the staff either 1) eating 2) leaving 3) sitting down and talking.  Some gent I assume to be the manager (wearing a button up, though not tucked in or with a tie) was in the kitchen but never came onto the floor.  Both of us were former servers so we were patient in waiting for someone to come to us but it was just strange how unattended the floor was at this time.  Why would servers be leaving when there were 10-12 tables still in the restaurant?  The girl taking care of us (our receipt says her name was Allie) had a lot to do and I felt bad, it didn't look like anyone was helping her until new people came in (and even then there was more standing around and talking than helping out).  I think this particular store needs to focus on their weekend staff between lunch/dinner.  We felt completely unattended for the first 30min we were there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-livonia-3?start=20
Plymouth J.,"Plymouth, MI",45,13,1,2.0,2/8/2014,"This chain location is big time inconsistent. First of all, the restaurant can't manage keeping itself hospitably warm. Whether it is its proximity to the outside or it's ovens sucking the heat out of the place, it's just damn cold in here. 7:00 ordering and they are out of their avocado appetizer they are promoting -- and the restaurant is not full. Chicken Milanese -- spongy chicken, likely a breaded cutlet (chopped & formed) -- not recommended. Spaghetti Bolognese: meh. Not worth finishing.  Roasted vegetable salad with grilled chicken: reliably good. Manager apologized and gave complimentary appetizer. Slow service. Not inspired to come back.

Cristin G.,"Livonia, MI",51,18,11,1.0,10/11/2014,"Quite possibly one of my worst restaurant experiences this year and it was nothing to do with the food.  I took my 3 year old out for a special dinner and she chose this restaurant. We were seated immediately but after 5 minutes still were not acknowledged by any server. After 11 minutes (yes I was timing on my phone) the server for a different section asked if we had been greeted then said she would be right with us. 3 minutes later our server, Ashley D, finally made an appearance. We had seen her several times at the next table over but she had never made eye contact or spoken to us. My daughter and I asked for waters which were not delivered for another 3-4 minutes. Our food order was taken and delivered promptly but we did not see our server again after 1st check back. I was finally able to flag her down 13 minutes after we had FINISHED eating. I saw a manager walking around but he never was close enough to flag down. Very disappointing experience and I will definitely not be recommending to anyone. Too bad too, the pizza, salad, and potato soup were delicious. I sent an email to CPK's corporate office detailing my visit and received an apology within 24 hours.

I have been a CPK fan for years (understanding it's a pricier place but always feeling it was worth the prices). I've had CPK in Novi, Troy, Chicago and others outside Michigan. But this location in Livonia is the closest.  I ordered a small chopped chicken salad ($9.99) and a regular bbq chicken pizza ($13.49). The salad was SO small that I thought they made a mistake and ordered a side salad. The pizza was over cooked and smaller than any pizza I've had at CPK. On top of that the carry out staff was ""too busy"" to even listen to me when I questioned the order. So I took it and left...prompting me to post this review.

P. F.,"Plymouth Township, MI",0,3,,2.0,4/29/2015,"I called in a curbside order on Tuesday 4/28/15.  The lady who took my order was nice. I mentioned the last time I had ordered curbside my quinoa salad seemed like a much smaller portion than having it served in the dining room.  She said she would make sure that was not an issue. I placed the rest of my order and requested complimentary bread. When I picked up the order they said they had no bread ready for me. I went home and opened my bag only to pull out my quinoa salad and find the same smaller portion I received before. So I called the manager Stephanie and explained the situation, she rather rudely told me that would not be possible because they have to weigh all the portions out. I told her I had ordered this salad multiple times in the restaurant and could barely finish it and that my take out portion was smaller. It ended up having 4 tiny pieces of asparagus and hardly any feta. After much procrastination she offered to refund my money for the salad. I live 20 minutes away and I had paid cash. She did not offer to take my name and offer me a free salad for next time.  Was really disappointed for a CFPK to treat a customer like that.

Lots of options for vegetarians from pizza to salads to sandwiches to pastas.  It's a little pricier than you'd expect a mall chain restaurant to be (pizzas in the $10-12 range, pastas $14ish, entrees in the $16+...).   Service was quick and friendly, the food arrived before I'd had a chance to gnaw off my arm, always appreciated.   I enjoyed the 5 cheese pizza a lot - it was my favorite of the ones we tried.  There was plenty of chopped basil sprinkled on top and the smoked gouda gave it a nice flavor.  It doesn't come with tomato sauce but I requested it, which was no problem.  The White Pizza also doesn't come with tomato sauce, but it's a nice touch if you request it.  This pizza was heavy on the garlic - so you should be a garlic lover to indulge!  The Italian Tomato & Basil pizza was also good, the tomatoes were flavorful and the Parmasean really stood out.  Pizzas are good sized, we all ate about 3/4 of ours.  This would be a good place to split a few pizzas for the table and order a salad or two to share (they're also generous portions).
