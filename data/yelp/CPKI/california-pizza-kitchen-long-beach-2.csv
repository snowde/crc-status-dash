Vivian L.,"Long Beach, CA",1,24,7,3.0,3/18/2017,"On Curbside Service NOT the food: So I've ordered multiple times and usually there aren't that many issues; however, today I was on hold for about 4-5 minutes just to order. They then tell me that the order will take 10-15 minutes, which is perfectly normal. I then call to say I'm on curbside 27 mins later and the order is still not ready. When I got the food the one entree was hot and everything else was a little cold.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach-2?start=20
Glen N.,"San Jose, CA",522,1305,1555,4.0,10/4/2015,"CPK is a dependable place to get a place at the ""bar"" with yummy pizzas (too small for two, gluttonous for one), full and half salads (I like the BBQ chicken without jicama) w/ seasonal menu changes (potato and fried egg pizza?), free hot fresh bread w/ crispy edge and herbed oil, friendly and attentive service (there's even a door opener), and a hella pour from a good wine selection.   They have a free membership so you can earn points: basically you get back $5 for every $100 you spend (or 5% back).  We got a small plate for signing up (a ho-hum asparagus salad: the white corn guacamole is great), and we took advantage of a $10 off $40 special. On the best night, it can be romantic, especially if you're sitting across the pizza oven which is like a fireplace (and a dinner show- these worker bees feel like a bad Circue di Soleil show and tge relentlessly busy pizza chefs are on point). On a bad night, it can be a Chuck E Cheese, especially if you have a distant, inconsiderate mom ignoring her curly-haired, idiotic butterball screaming at the top of his lungs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach-2?start=20
Marie G.,"Belmont Shore, CA",28,15,,4.0,3/30/2017,"Without a doubt, CPK, is one of my favorite restaurants for a delicious, healthy salad!   In addition to the salads, my favorite CPK soup is the smashed pea and barley.  I do wish that CPK would bring back my all-time favorite soup.  I think it was an asparagus soup--soooo freakin' delicious.  I miss that soup so much!      This CPK location is my favorite because of one server, Amanda Jay.  Amanda is a very friendly, welcoming, easy-going, attentive, and courteous server.  Moreover, it helps that she is a long-time CPK server so she knows the menu inside and out.  I love that Amanda knows the menu and her job so well that she doesn't need to write down my order (or my husband's).   The only ding for me about CPK is the ""new look"" at all the locations.  I don't like the new seating, the new color combinations, or the ""feel"". I preferred the original seating as it was more comfortable and looked a lot nicer.  If it weren't for the new look, I'd definitely give CPK five stars.   And, oh, yes, the alcoholic drinks at CPK are the bomb!  I just wish that there were FREE refills (as with water and soft drinks) and that they cost a lot less!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach-2?start=20
Andrew P.,"Long Beach, CA",138,341,761,4.0,6/3/2016,"One of my favorite restaurants since forever - CPK has always been my go-to restaurant for special occasions, birthdays, etc. I've always enjoyed the atmosphere here and they have been constantly changing the looks of it for the better each time.  I always order a salad and pizza, and every time they come out tasting on point no matter when I come in. I have been to this location many, many times and every time we have typically had great service. No complaints there. Although, this last time it did take a while for our salad and soup to come out. Not a problem though.  One of the girls brought us waters and accidentally spilt one of them all over the table and a little bit on another person in the party. Again, no worries. We understand that those things happen and it was totally out of her control. We were assured that it would get cleaned up as soon as possible, and it was. Even the manager came over and made sure everything was ok after that. Kudos to this location for always having great customer service and valuing their customers; it is so key to running a successful business.  I will say though, that they have definitely been raising their prices and it has led us to choose other options lately. Not that we don't enjoy coming here, but it's just become a lot more pricey. For the 3 of us, our total came out to over $110 not including tip. That is with the alcoholic beverages of course, but it still seemed pricey for a casual dinner. Nonetheless, we will still be back of course.  Two notes I may add:  We continue to still really like their complimentary bread and oil that's provided (this time we were provided another plate of bread additionally without asking and of course devoured it). We love bread as you can tell.  Secondly, I'm still very disappointed that the California Club sandwich was taken off the menu. It's been gone from the menu for a while, but I really enjoyed it. They have a pizza version of it, but I'm not a fan of it as much. I wish they could bring it back onto their menu.  Again, a very solid restaurant and the location is great if you're driving along PCH or near the beach area. There is a lot to do around here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach-2?start=20

Katie B.,"Irvine, CA",27,233,,2.0,11/18/2016,"I made the mistake of ordering one of their seasonal dishes. The roasted garlic chicken was served to me burnt, with the skin visibly black. Thinking that the problem might just be on the surface, I took several bites, only to discover that yes, the chicken was rubbery and bitter to the point that it was inedible. Sent it back, 30 minutes later came back with a less burned one, but the chicken was still very tough, so I gave up. The manager did remove it off of the bill, which was appreciated, but obviously that menu item is severely flawed and/or poorly executed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach-2?start=20

Pamela R.,"Temecula, CA",37,68,477,4.0,4/30/2016,"Description:  The one thing that I appreciate about California Pizza Kitchen is that I know that I will get a consistent experience no matter which location that I choose to eat at.  They offer a special twists of flavors on traditional pizza and pastas dishes. Location: Located in the Market Place shopping center it sits on the corner directly behind the Trader Joe's grocery store off of Pacific Coast Highway Décor:  All their restaurants are decorated with light woods and yellows that feature a modern sleek design.    Menu:  The menu has a nice variety of pizza's, sandwiches, pastas, salads, etc.  I particularly enjoy the fresh herbs that help in creating a good dish.  They offer several signature fare that compel you to keep coming back for more such as the Quinoa Arugula Salad, Five Cheese Pizza, and a personal fav is The Original BBQ Chicken Pizza (Yum).  The bread and olive oil dip is good as well.  FYI:  They offer gluten free options as well as vegetarian choices.    Service:  Though nothing extraordinary it is always friendly and attentive.  FYI:  They do not take reservations; it is a first come first serve basis.  I have never had to wait very long for a table. Atmosphere:  The atmosphere is casual mid-level sit down dining experience.  They have take-out services as well Restrooms: Large bathrooms that were well maintained Final Thoughts: What I appreciate about The California Pizza Kitchen is that you can feel confident that you always receive a good experience no matter which location you go to.  The Long Beach location is no exception to this rule.  I personally prefer coming for lunch as the prices are more reasonable and you get pretty much the same selections.  This is a good standard choice for a dining experience at the Market Place in Long Beach.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach-2?start=20

Pete S.,"Cypress, CA",473,1401,1557,4.0,8/25/2015,"This place was recently remodeled to complement their new menu. Yes, they are serving other items besides pizza. Sirloin is on their menu and rustic is the look they are now going for. I love coming here, even though I live to 2 other locations that are closer. I did, just noticed last week when I was here, some of the menu items has higher prices.  Dang it!  Other than that, I love that they always open the door for you when you come in and leave. The manager on duty always manage to do some small talk with you.  Oh, the lunch menu now consists of combos with Pizza and soup for $11 or 1/2 Sandwich and soup for $10. My favorite tequila pasta is now a whopping $17 for pretty much 5 bites of bliss. I tried making it at home and failed so that's why I still keep ordering it. :) Best way to beat the system here is when they have the $10 off $40 with your CPK rewards and if you can buy the gift cards through Costco. Otherwise, I cannot seem to afford the new menu anymore just for a simple lunch with the family since it now costs me over $60 with 2 kids and 2 seniors.  Good thing the damage is at a location I love with great service,  thus not as painful on the wallet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach-2?start=20

I felt so unwelcome there, everyone was getting good service except us. She came took our orders and dropped off our stack of plates and just disappeared. Didn't ask to refill our drinks or anything, everything we had to call her for. Saw other servers set up their plates and give them complimentary bread which I didn't know about. So I asked her for some and she said, ""oh sorry when I tried to get you some... they ran out."" Clearly a lie our plates already came out by then and we didn't get complimentary bread till after our meal. Saw other tables receiving it before us. Wow just wow. If she meant to get it she would of informed us at least before our meals came out.  My first experience and I don't want to come back. The other servers seemed fine maybe they should just fire her. Then we asked to claim a free small meal since I signed up for an awards card, she told us we get a free small plate with our meal for being first timers so we can claim it next time.... Okay... Why didn't you say that before? Then we proceeded to wait and got a small plate 15 minutes after our meal was done.

Dustin B.,"Anaheim, CA",40,33,8,5.0,8/10/2015,"So I finally decided to Yelp this California Pizza Kitchen and let me tell you, I'm not sure what took me so long. I started making this place my Monday night spot and I never leave disappointed. The customer service is spot on every single time. Mary and Brian behind the bar make killer drinks and they make sure you're well taken care of. Any of the servers that you get are great but I sit at the bar mainly to watch the big TVs they have hanging.  The only draw back is that I tend to fall in love with ""seasonal"" salads and as it states they are only seasonal(gone sooner than later) The Caramelized Peach salad was amazing--gone. My saving grace in that is the manager who always seems to be on duty when I go in. April. Not only is she always checking on customers around the resturant, she assured me that aside from the seasonal peaches, she could have the chefs remake the salad any time which goes way above and beyond in my book. Customer service is what gets people to come back and I'll be back for sure. Probably every Monday.  BY THE WAY do NOT let your sweet tooth go un-satisfied. Whatever you do, ask for April and have her make you ""The Dirty Butter"". It's CPK's butter cake but it has Caramel AND Chocolate sauce drizzled over it with cookie crumbles and some secret addition that kicks it over the top. Not to mention the ice cream. The picture below is not ""The Dirty Butter "" but the only thing it's missing is the chocolate sauce. I'm not ready for that yet.

The manager finally came only because I called the host to ask who would be serving us, but she also didn't know. Our drinks arrived about 10 minutes later, but still no waiter insight. I called the host over again and the manger arrived to take our order, mind you the table directly across and next to use is being serviced by two different waitresses, but never once looked our way. We waited and waited 40 minutes went by when I flagged the manager down and asked as to why tables that arrived way later than us were already being served?! I mean the arrived a good 45 after us an had had appetizer and dinner served.  I asked for the check because I was just about done by then, but he insisted in having us wait while he check on the food again. Well another 20 minutes go by and we finally get our tasteless half-ass food and still manage to miss my daughters mac&cheese. I was so upset, I lost it and simple walked out! The pizza was cold, the pasta was tasteless and service was beyond insulting!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach-2
Steve C.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,204,2788,1.0,9/2/2017,"Four years later and service still sucks. It's unbelievable how bad service has become the norm. Companies have no one to blame but themselves when going out of business.  I was just here a few minutes ago. I was very hesitant about coming here considering the horrible service from years ago; yes, it's been years since I came to this location. No matter how many times I drove-by, I would never think once about coming here.  I went against my instincts and dined here today. I sat at the counter. The waitress asked what I wanted to drink. I told her water and that I would like to start with the white corn guacamole and chips. That was delivered really fast. More than ten minutes went by and no contact with the server. She talked to the couple to the left...just shooting the shit, then walked away to perform another task. Another server began shooting the shit with the couple, then walked right by and talked to the guy next to me while taking his plate. By now I've had it. I bluntly said ""would someone take my order"".  The manager guy was very apologetic and took my order. He somewhat became the server from that point-on. By now, I was disgusted both at the unacceptable service and with myself for giving-in, going against my instincts and returning here after many years.  The server was whispering crap to the couple; talking in low key...like telling a secret. Not sure what it was about, but regardless, that is unacceptable behavior, especially in front of other customers.  One big mistake servers and restaurants make quite often is treating their ""local/frequent"" customers better than what they mistakingly think and label as outside customers. I've read many complaints and reviews about that behavior. I've also witnessed it.  A word of caution, they should be very careful with labeling regular customers because a customer which they never see that suddenly dines in the restaurant, could be one of their biggest customers by ordering everyday through various online delivery services or even messenger services. Furthermore, that person could be ordering under a different name such as the name of his assistant who places the order on behalf of their boss or team, the name of the messenger, etc. The point is that they should treat every single customer as a ""normal/frequent"" customer. But, as usual, having someone process a thought is nearly impossible nowadays. With other customers, the server was fine, but with me, not so much. The manager provided excellent service, but no service situation should ever have to reach that point. A server should be qualified and capable of doing their job correctly.  I only left $3 for the tip, but seriously regret doing so. This place is officially blacklisted for life. There are many alternatives available. The restaurant industry and CPK type food a monopolistic competition; CPK clearly has no monopoly on the industry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach-2

The host Lance greeted us and he was very nice, we had a genuine conversation on the way to the table. Erica, our server and was very attentive the entire meal. I got the BBQ chicken pizza and my girlfriend got the bolognese spaghetti. The bread they bring you before your entree is SO GOOD! I wanted to save a piece to eat  later in the meal, but failed miserably..  I didn't have to ask for a refill on my soda because Erica noticed I was running low and brought me another. This is a restaurant pet peeve of mine, if I run out of my drink during the meal and I have to wait a long time for a refill I'm not a happy camper. BUT, not to worry cause Erica was on it!  We were stuffed, my girlfriend said her spaghetti was excellent and she loved the fresh lemonade, my pizza was also good! Disputed that, we had lots left so Erica swept our plates away and boxed them up for us, thanks for the awesome service!

It tasted like they pretty much microwaved it.  Strike #2  I tried to order the pesto penne pasta w/ chicken and they said that they took that off the menu along with the spring rolls Strike #3  I skipped an entree and got dessert... of course I ordered the butter cake. I didn't think it was possible for them to ruin and shit on their signature/popular ""everyone's favorite"" dessert, but I guess so. The butter cake tasted like they made it 3 days ago and let it sit in the fridge... so you can imagine how shit it was.

But unfortunately, this is the second time my mom's plate was just WRONG. She ordered the tequila lime pasta, with chicken which is $3 more. Fine, no problem. Our food came and she started moving her pasta around and actually separated the chicken and no lie, there were like 5 tiny pieces of chicken in her plate. And we are paying for this?! We called over our server who was Paige who was actually really nice, helpful and understanding. She told the chef to cook more chicken for my mom's plate but by this time we were just in complete shock. I know it's a restaurant but isn't there like a certain amount they normally put? When they brought the plate, the manager (female with dice tattoo on arm, can't remember name) brought it over and told us that they can put more chicken we just have to ask for extra chicken. Yeah, but I'm sure they charge another $3 right??? I asked what the amount of chicken they put and she told me ""We are supposed to put 2.5 ounces of chicken. I don't agree with the amount, but that's protocol."" I'm not asking for a whole chicken on my plate but if I'm asking for chicken on my pasta I want a decent amount of chicken on my plate, especially if I'm paying for like $15++ for my plate.

Michelle T.,"Orange County, CA",1018,365,2768,4.0,1/8/2016,"The Long Beach Marketplace is well-known for its shopping opportunities. However after making several purchases, you'll eventually need to catch lunch or dinner before you leave. Therefore, my coworkers suggested that we meet for lunch at California Pizza Kitchen.  CPK is located on the corner of Pacific Coast Highway and 2nd Street in the city of Long Beach. It is in the northeast corner of the lot, facing PCH. Ample parking is available throughout the shopping center but if it's packed, you can always park across the street. My coworkers arrived before me so they were already seated at a table. As I looked around, I noticed that most tables had bench seats just like their booths. That makes sense to me because I look at it from a safety perspective. People tend to trip over chairs and I like that CPK took that into consideration when working on the layout and decor of their restaurant. When you think of CPK, most people probably associate pizza with this restaurant. However, their menu has a lot more available to people who might want something different. They have a variety of salads as well as fish selections like halibut and salmon. If you're not in the mood for pizza, you could order pasta as an alternative. I was feeling very hungry so I chose the pesto cream penne pasta. I omitted the tomatoes but added shrimp. While we waited for our food to arrive, our server brought us some bread with an herb-olive oil dip. There were four of us in our party but there were only 5 pieces of bread. I thought that was a bit odd since it didn't seem to be enough for anyone who may have wanted to eat a couple of slices of bread.  Soon after, our meals arrived and then our server brought out another plate of bread. I guess she realized the error and caught it before we could say anything. She was really on top of things. Yay!!! The serving size was perfect for lunch as it was enough to fill me up without making me feel like I overindulged in a heavy meal. The pesto sauce was light and had a creamy blend with great flavor. The shrimp was grilled and the meat was nice and firm with each bite. The tails were still on each one so I removed them prior to eating my pasta. My coworkers really enjoyed their meals too as all but one finished what they ordered. My friend took the rest home to finish for dinner later that evening. I really liked CPK as it's a healthier alternative to some of the other pizza places. The health conscious individuals will be able to find something specific to their dietary needs. Gluten free options are also available upon request. CPK is ideal for a quick meal with a small group of people. Larger parties might find this place to be a bit limited when it comes to accommodations. I'm very happy that I finally had a chance to dine at California Pizza Kitchen because the food was delicious. I recommend CPK to anyone who wants a quick, filling meal at a decent price. Service is great, the restaurant is clean, and their menu is diverse enough for people that want to explore many options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach-2

CPK's menu gets tweaked occasionally, and they've had some nice new, non pizza, additions to the menu as of late.  Facilities: well kept, comfortable, clean and well lit. Service: Great! Our server, Michelle, was very friendly, informative and as fast as she could be. The only thing keeping it from being perfect is that our area was understaffed so she couldn't get to everyone quite as quickly as she wanted to. Drinks: had water and coffee. The coffee was nice and strong. First cup was not very hot, the next was from a fresh, hot pot. The cream is served in dinky little thimbles though, so you should ask for a few extra. Food: Very good! Had their chili relleno and that was very tasty, especially considering that this is a gringo restaurant :-D Their salad with caramelized peaches was excellent! Very delicious, especially with the grilled chicken added for some substantive protein content. We had the dressing in the side and had no need to use it because it had such a delicious flavor without it. Dessert: Had the new caramel salted pudding dessert, it was very good but could've used less salt :-P",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach-2?start=100

I enjoyed their stories, but then it moved to our waitress. I don't know if she felt trapped or not. I kept eating my pizza and drinking my Newcastle. Speaking of pizza...  I once again had the White Pizza on Honey Wheat with Applewood Smoked Bacon. The first time I had it was via take out at the CPK on Pine. (Which I've already reviewed). I don't normally order white pizzas as I am a meat eater. Be it sausage, pepperoni, chicken, etc. But I got the bacon to help satisfy my meat cravings. It was just as good as the last time, but it was missing the hot sauce that I love to pour on my pizza... well everything really.  I also had some of their new Crispy Artichoke Hearts. Which were okay. I don't see myself ever ordering them again. I can make better friend artichoke hearts at home. I mean I have all the ingredients (panko bread crumbs, artichoke hearts, parmesan cheese) in my kitchen right now. Hmmmm... I think I'll to make them now.

I normally go to the Bella Terra location but since Claim Jumpers here in LB was closed for 4th of July my wife and I ended up here at this CPK. Service was friendly and the food quality seemed the same to me as the other location.  My wife had a cup of tortilla soup and the crab cake appetizer. She said both were very good and was full from it. I personally thought both items looked terribly small, but since she's had lap band surgery it was perfect size for her.  I had the Buffalo Chicken Pizza. I loooove wing sauce and was happy to taste wing sauce in every bite. The pizza had wing marinated chicken, carrots, celery, and blue cheese. Very tasty and I enjoyed thoroughly.  In summary, I really enjoyed my lunch and so did my wife. Only negatives on this visit is the prices have definitely gone up and we didn't get any bread that every other table got.... We both agreed we didn't need the extra calories but they could of at least asked. The calorie count printed next to every item on the menu was highly disturbing too.... some of these dishes had 1700+ calories... I don't need to know this.

Not because it's horrendous or I've had horrific food here, but there GLUTEN-FREE menu does not include pizza. When non-gluten-free friends suggest meeting up here, I'm always like, ""Why f*cking bother. I can't have pizza there."" WHY DON'T THEY HAVE PIZZA ON THEIR GLUTEN-FREE MENU?!? BJ's Pizza does. So does ZPizza. All they have on their menu is salads, which are good, but no better than one's you could get most places. Also, if you're Gluten-free, please note that the people at the location here don't really know what that means. I ordered a salad that came with some sort of tortilla strips. It was on the gluten-free menu, but just to double check, I asked if the strips were  gluten-free, and they had no idea, the chef had no idea, so I told them to skip it.

As it is, I had half a Cobb Salad for $10.99. My wife had the Chinese Salad for $10.79, which she liked. I had a 9 oz. carafe of their J.

Jed P.,"Fort Collins, CO",183,34,20,5.0,7/20/2011,"I have to give this particular California Pizza Kitchen the cream of the crop award.  Great food, clean, and the establishment remembers your name and even what you order. I've always seem very mixed reviews about this place and I'm a bit picky about my pizza considering that I'm Chicago boy who loves a good pizza, especially a deep dish one. Although here, I wasn't looking for pizza so much as what's good on the menu.  Every time I go back I always order the Garlic Cream Fettuccine with mushroom and chicken--don't forget the mozzarella.  Creamiest sauce I've ever tasted without overpowering the rest of the dish. And if you want something a tad healthier, I do recommend the Waldorf Chicken salad.  I mean you got to love the blue cheese, sweet walnuts, and chopped apples with chicken, all lathered with a balsamic vinaigrette that just puts everything together.  It's one of my favorites. You want cake?  You ever see those photos on the little advertisements they stick on the tables?  I saw one for velvet cake and they should have a sign on those things that says, ""Objects look smaller than they appear here"".  Although, this was not the case.  I ordered their velvet cake and they stick it on what looks like a huge guitar pick, but it is a thing of beauty.  The little advertisement didn't do it justice and it really is the great meal finisher... to share with friends of course.   Not something you want to eat by yourself. One of the best parts about dining here is that they have a system where you can actually pay for your meal at the table.  There's a miniature electronic kiosk at each table that allows you to pay and tip without having to wave down your waiter/waitress. Parking is really easy, but you want to avoid parking in some of the spots facing the double doors that face the street because they sit over the sewage drain and it smells as if someones rear end had a party all in the one area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach-2?start=100

Matt E.,"Long Beach, CA",161,343,122,4.0,10/2/2011,"I have to be honest, I've shown up to the CPK appreciation party quite late in their 26 years of existence. Mind you I grew up around a father who made homemade gourmet pizzas (I swear he should have opened up his own restaurant), so the need to go out for pizza was really non-essential. But even as of recently, the lure of CPK never hit me. I've been happy with small independent pizza joints around Long Beach but after getting a gift certificate, I can now say for sure that CPK can definitely hold their own.  Since getting that gift certificate, the wife and and I have been to this location twice. Both times have been enjoyable experiences. Service was on point, although I believe all visits were made in the late afternoon. Well before the rush of post 7 PM dinners.  Food-wise, I've never disliked anything I've ordered here...with an exception for the Wild Mushroom pizza. I think this was a preference of taste, nothing ""wrong"" with the pizza itself. I just didn't care for the flavor profile (which is weird since I really like mushrooms). I do enjoy their small serving appetizers, especially the Mediterranean focaccia bread and the fried Mac and Cheese. They are perfect for groups of two to share...and at like 3 bucks each, you can't really beat the price.  Their full sized Cobb salad is HUGE...so if you're looking to get a normal sized salad, try to the half size order. As for their pizza, we usually split a BBQ'd Chicken Pizza. I like the crust and the BBQ sauce is pretty good. Along with the appetizers, pizza, drinks and a desert...the cost comes out just over 40 bucks with tip. I also like the fact that their pizza isn't overly greasy or filling...as a whole, eating here doesn't fill you up beyond the comfort point (although if you wanted to I'm sure you could hit that level) but allows you to eat a nice meal and fills up the hunger meter to a substantial level...yes, I'm talking as if we're SIMS here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach-2?start=100

I do like that they offer so many soup options which I think they all are vegetarian. Also had the small plate asparagus and arugula salad.  Always like this - it's nice and light.  Like the addition of the sun dried tomatoes as it adds some saltiness to the dish.    Am a bit disappointed that you have to ask for a listing of their calorie and nutritional information.

Tulip L.,"Long Beach, CA",555,77,276,2.0,3/1/2014,"We came here for a celebratory dinner with my sorority. There were about 28 of us, so we took up an entire section of the restaurants. There were girls demanding MORE BREAD or WE NEED WATER over the chatters of 28 pairs of mouth, I can understand how our party could've been daunting to take on. But what they did at the end of the night was inexcusable.  But first, what I (and basically everyone) ordered - Valentine $30 course: this was a AWESOME deal that they had going on for Valentine couples. And it was A LOT of food, we had to share it between four people. Idk how two people can finish this meal. Or maybe I can, because...well, 'MURICA. We had the spinach artichoke dip, bbq chicken pizza, creamy garlic pasta AND a red velvet cake for dessert. Everything was super delicious and we all had a great time.  Now here's my gripe: at the end of the meal, they overcharge us $80! After we put in our money for the meals, we couldn't understand how we could've been short by SO much, with tax and tip included into the meal. After close inspection of the receipt, they charged us for our $30 vday meal and then charged the same items as extra items! Of course, we thought it was a mistake, but when the waitress looked at it she blatantly says it was all correct! Now we knew something was wrong. The manager came over and looked over the receipt, she then whisked away without a word and took off some items and said it was correct and she left before we looked at it. After inspecting the receipt, we were still charged extra for 3 pastas, 2 red velvet cakes and 4 pizzas. This is ridiculous! The only thing she took off was 1 pasta. We called the waitress back and showed her item by item and how were not suppose to be charged for these. The cold and lifeless look on her face says it all: she's playing dumb. Are they seriously going to cheat 26 asian girls. Uh, I don't think so! Then our blood was boiling. At the end they took off the extra items EXCEPT for one pizza. We gave up and left, the extra pizza was paid for with the tip. Two stars for the food, -500 for the shady business practice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach-2?start=80

Being poor college students at a place with steep prices, we shared:  - WHITE CORN GUACAMOLE + CHIPS: Wonderful guacamole. Loved the corn; it gave a sweet taste, and a textural difference. Only drawback was the ratio of guacamole-to-chip ratio was off, and we wished we got a tad bit more of guacamole.   - WHITE PIZZA: Amazing pizza, loved the little bits of ricotta all throughout. Would definitely get it again.  Only drawbacks is that I wish that our waitress refilled our bread and soda.  Overall, all CPKs have expensive prices for little portions.

We were close to a party of twenty.  It was the night of my niece's graduation.   Waiting for more than twenty minutes was understandable consdering we did not make reservations and such.  That was fine.    So why the 1star?  The four older kids (12 to 14 yrs old) ordered a large pizza they told the waiter they were sharing.  Instead they receive a small size. (Since when can a group of older kids share a small size pizza? )  We ordered & requested for their bread.  Never came.  Plus, they never even came once to refill our glasses for water.   Bottom line.  I get very disappointed at any establishment when you feel like you have to flag down whoever just to get their attention for anything.  This is the worst feeling from a customer's stand point.  Its just not good practice.

I love their salads, pizza and pasta...The original chopped salad is amazing and I love the dressing which comes with it - I could eat this salad every day and never grow tired of it.  I always get thin crust pizza's and they are equally tasty (no matter which one I get but my favorite is the pepperoni - I am pretty much a creature of habit but I have tried the bque chicken, the thai chicken and the artichoke/spinach and honestly they are all quite delicious).   Pizza is one of those menu items which is very personal and subjective and imost likely if you come from NY, you just may not find our Cali pizza to be to your quite biased liking (I am from Cali but have eaten plenty of NY pizza, which I love as well) but in no way does it diminish CPK pizza - apples and oranges really.  However, both are equally savory in their own unique ways.

We decided to try the ""small plates"" as our appetizer. Our server did offer to put a complimentary bread basket on the table but we declined because we knew we were going to go into carb overload. It was nice that she asked first instead of just plopping it on the table. Who can resist warm bread?  Anyway, we truly enjoyed the small plates. I had the asparagus arugula salad and my mom had the petite wedge. Both were very refreshing and different from your typical run of the mill salads. We were in a pizza kind of mind so we chose to have the new roasted garlic chicken pizza and the meat cravers pizza. Let me just say CPK knows how to make pizza honey. Both pizzas were absolutely mouth watering. I like the pizza dough that they use. It's so light and flaky. Whenever I eat pizza at other establishments I feel stuffed after eating 2 slices but CPK pizzas aren't like that. The ingredients on the pizza are the stars not the dough which means you really get the full taste of the pizza and not just a mouth full of crust.

Michelle And Ryan P.,"Concord, CA",49,122,52,2.0,2/26/2011,"Went on a Friday night with a 15 minute wait. Wait was not too bad, but once we sat at our table it took our waiter ten minutes to greet us and get our drink orders. He then took another five minutes to come back with the drinks. One other complaint: The noise level was amazingly loud in this place. There were people nearly shouting at each other just to be heard. Not sure why the noise level was so loud, but it was annoying.  The food was the only positive thing as it tasted great. However, our appetizer took ten minutes to come out and our meals took another 15 minutes after that. Meanwhile, all of this time our waiter was nowhere to be seen.  They have these new kiosks one each table that show you pictures of menu items and let you pay your bill directly at the table whenever you want. They sound good on paper, but most of them were being used by children as entertainment because their parents are too busy to notice.  I am not surprised they have these kiosks here because the waiters are never around and take forever to do anything. Of course as soon as we started to pay the bill via the kiosk, the waiter showed up and tried to sound like our best friend so we would give him a good tip.

Their service here was about as slow as it gets.  We were here for at least 45 minutes longer than we needed to be.  Our waiter and the hostess were actually very friendly and great.  The issue was that they were so understaffed that we hardly saw them and had to wait for a long time for everything. I should have realized there would be an issue when we arrived on a Wednesday night and there was no hostess at the front.  She was apparently helping the wait staff, but then came running to get my name once she saw us at the front counter.  She told us that it would be a 5-10 minute wait (even though 2/3rds of the seating was empty).  So we came back 15 minutes later, and when she saw us she came running up again and seated us.  That pretty much set the tone for the rest of our time here.  Both the hostess and our waiter were as friendly as could be, but it was obvious that they were very understaffed.  What was a great meal was dampened by having to wait so long for each and every thing.  I'd rather visit another CPK that has enough staff to operate the restaurant appropriately.  It was a huge waste of time, and it makes me hesitant to eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach-2?start=60

Liz O.,"Long Beach, CA",868,479,62,2.0,12/7/2008,"While all you Yelp Elites were out partying at the OYE in Culver City -- I went Christmas Tree shopping. Jealous? Afterwards, we decided -- and I really don't know what possessed us -- to go to California Pizza Kitchen for dinner.  I've never really been a fan of CPK, but they do have decent spring rolls and artichoke dip. The pizza is a little hit or miss; I have always favored the Jamaican Jerk pizza over the rest.  We started off with the shrimp spring rolls served with a ginger sesame sauce. Nothing to rave about -- simple, fresh and...simple. The bruschetta dish was not all that great. We were served an entire loaf of focaccia cheese bread and extremely thick (almost whole) tomatoes. They could have chopped the tomatoes a little smaller and perhaps helped out with the slicing of the bread. To sit there and slice your own bread is a bit of an inconvenience considering there are others who wish to share the dish and would rather not have multiple hands on the bread.  (Take note) We ordered the Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza; which was rather dry and lacked flavor. I was disappointed with this pizza -- but not surprised it sucked. The service was standard; the waitress came by from time to time and topped off our drinks and flashed a smile. Perhaps I should have voiced my opinion, but I was unmotivated. Gourmet pizza should be left to places that don't offer franchise opportunities. Once you go chain -- your food is a pain. *Thank you.

To make a long story short, our meal order was taken approximately fifteen minutes later.  Our meal arrived about the time that our companions were finished with theirs.   I eventually received an order of ""Shanghai garlic noodles with shrimp"" (Chinese noodles wok-stirred in a garlic-ginger sauce with snow peas, Shiitake mushrooms, mild onions, red and yellow peppers, baby broccoli and scallions).  It was good, but I'll be damned if the same meal doesn't come frozen in a plastic bag at Trader Joe's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach-2?start=160
