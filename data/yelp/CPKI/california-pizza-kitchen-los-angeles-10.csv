Yolanda D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,2,5.0,10/22/2017,"Saturday.... you wanna get some shopping and a good meal in DTLA ???? I found my need for shopping therapy and good food with a warm fuzzy feeling when I decided to eat at CPK. Darrin looked professional, clean and shaved.  I say this, because I see some service employees looking like they just got to work with a shower or a shave.  Thank you Darrin, your smile and service was sincere and good.  You see, when I walked in- I did not know what I wanted to eat... I left up to him... and they choice was awesome. Shrimp Scampi Pizza wow! and I did indulge in a piece of cheesecake, had to get the Pumpkin fix.  Loved it, and I will come back and enjoy a truly good experience on my truly precious Saturdays!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-10
Angela A.,"Riverside, CA",259,174,389,4.0,9/29/2016,"I really enjoyed my time at this CPK it is a great location with great service! Our server Javier was nice, funny, and attentive, so he definitely made it enjoyable for us! I came here with my boyfriend and his family and we were starving after walking around DTLA, so we ordered a bunch of food to share! Our server started us of with some recommendations and we and decided to order the recommend Sangria Flight! It comes with three different flavors and I enjoyed each one! My favorite was the Beehive Sangria, though. The alcohol was not strong at all and I would definitely want to order the full sized one after trying it out. For appetizers we ordered the White Corn Guacamole + Chips, the Brussels + Bacon Flatbread, the Crispy Mac 'N' Cheese, and a Full Classic Caesar Salad! That's a lot of food... the appetizers I enjoyed the most were the Brussels + Bacon Flatbread and the Crispy Mac 'N' Cheese! I was actually really surprised at home much I liked the flatbread because I usually don't like brussel sprouts, but I loved how they tasted with the bacon on the flatbread. As for the Crispy Mac 'N' Cheese I ALWAYS order it whenever I go to CPK because of how much I love mac 'n' cheese and they always taste so good! I hope they never get rid of it on their menu! We also ordered the Sicilian Crispy Thin Crust Pizza and it was really good! I've ordered it before at other CPK's and I always enjoy how it comes out!  At this point I was already really full, but then found out that I could redeem one free dessert because I am a CPK rewards member and it was my birthday this month! And I went through and redeemed the offer and ordered the Key Lime Pie, which only covers desserts for free without including ice cream. So, if you wanted to order a dessert that is offered with ice cream you would have to pay the extra if you wanted to include ice cream with it. Which to me is a bit weird, but whatever it's still a free dessert! The Key Lime Pie was really yummy, but I think I would have enjoyed it more if I wasn't so full, haha!  Glad we stopped by here to eat instead of hunting down the food trucks that we saw earlier in the day! I left full and happy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-10
Jaime J.,"Riverside, CA",114,295,399,5.0,9/27/2016,"I've been to CPK's before and I'd rate them 3 or 4 stars had I used Yelp back then. This location however amazed me with their service! The waiter that took our orders is named Javier. Really cool guy! He started by recommending drinks while we looked through the menu. My mom and sister were in the mood for wine so we took him up on that recommendation. We tried the Sangria Flight and they were really good! The Beehive Sangria was the best in my opinion! The other appetizers were all delicious, and we really appreciated the generosity! Great way to start up the stomach engines. We contemplated ordering two pizzas but ended up ordering a full salad and one thin crust pizza. The Sicilian was delicious! We were full before we knew it! The food came out really fast! We felt well taken care of! By then we were being served by someone else since Javier had to leave. The waitress asked if we were interested in dessert and that's when my girlfriend remembered about her free birthday reward (that is, a free dessert excluding any ice cream). She brought out our Key Lime Pie (and deducted the cost from our check) and gave us some forks. The pie was amazing! It was nice and zesty. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit. Thank you CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-10
Randi K.,"Los Angeles, CA",481,85,3,5.0,2/12/2017,"I have been meaning to write a review on this place for years, as I have been a customer that long. I live and work in downtown LA. There are very few places in downtown to go to when you don't have food in the house, don't want to cook, don't have time to go to the gorcery store, and don't want to spend a fortune. (Most of the restaurants downtown are expensive). CPK on Hope Street fits the bill. This place is within walking distance of where I live and work. Not only is it convenient, but it is really my version of ""Cheers."" I often see my neighbors in this restaurant. Sometimes I join them when I see them. The waitresses know many of us, and we are all on a first name basis.  ""Everybody knows our names.""   Sometimes when I go in by myself, the waitresses will ask me where my other neighbors are, or if I have seen them. Sometimes when the waitresses have checked out, they will sit down at my table and join me for a conversation while I am eating.  One of the waitresses has been to my home for dinner. Others will be invited. So, not only does this place feel like home, but also the food is tasty, heathly and affordable. (They have salads and vegetarian dishes, as well as pasta and pizza's). Unfortuately, CPK on Hope Street will be closing down. Next Friday night, February 17, 2017, is their last night. I am really going to miss this place. I am going to miss seeing my neighbors there, and the people who work there. I am going to miss my version of ""Cheers."" Even though this location will be closing its doors, I just had to write a review of them before they are gone. Thanks to everyone who works there who have made many of us feel at home. You will all  be missed! I hope that most of us will keep in touch!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-10
George A.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,6,,5.0,2/17/2017,"We just found out that this location is closing today. This is my family and friends favorite CPK location, over 20 years. We've driven two hours just to make it to this location even though there were others along the way. Out of all the CPK locations we've visited in California and other states, this is the best location when it comes to ambiance, food, and service. Our experience has always been great with the different managers and servers. Especially because this location has Javier.  Javier doesn't just take orders and brings food. He treats everyone as if they were family coming over to share a meal at his home. He's patient with large groups and children. Always suggesting appetizers and plates based on ingredients that you may or may not like. He'll say, ""next time you're here try the..."".  One time a group of women was sitting across from us and one of them ordered a bottle of her favorite wine. Her friends were surprised that Javier would remember to which the lady spoke highly of him. That's the level of service you'd only expect at a Morton's or Mastro's.  We're going to miss this location. Wish everyone and Javier the best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-10

The Food:  California Club Pizza - Nueske's applewood smoked bacon, roasted chicken and mozzarella, hearth-baked then topped with avocado, wild arugula, fresh torn basil and romaine tossed in lemon-pepper mayo.

Rick K.,"West Covina, CA",0,101,91,4.0,8/13/2016,"Recently went here on a Sunday evening to meet family from out of town for dinner.  I used to work about three blocks from this CPK so I have been here a few times.  I called ahead to make a reservation.  The young lady that took my call curtly told me that they did not take reservations.  OK.  I then inquired about the parking.  In the past, I always walked to this restaurant and did not know about the parking.  Again, she was abrupt with her explanation about the parking.  I was beginning to have second thoughts about coming here. We met our party in front of the restaurant.  We were greeted immediately on going into the restaurant.  We were seated right away, given menus and our drink order taken.  Our drinks came right away and they brought us complimentary bread.   Our party ordered mainly salads.  I had the Jambalaya Fettuccine (Blackened chicken and shrimp, crawfish, Andouille sausage and Tasso ham in spicy Cajun sauce. My meal was pretty good.  Not too spicy but the sauce was a bit heavy.  My complaint would be my shrimp still had their tails on.  I DO NOT EAT SHRIMP TAILS AND I DO NOT WANT TAIL-ON SHRIMP IN A DISH.  It is a pain trying to get the tails off shrimp when it is buried in fettuccine.  When shrimp is served by itself, no problem if you leave the tails on.  Ok, rant over. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals.  Our server stopped by from time to time to check on us and refill drinks.  Good service.  Happily, our server did not try to rush us out the door.  We had a nice, leisurely dinner. The noise level in this restaurant is usually pretty bad.  However, carrying on a conversation was fairly easy this evening.  When we got up to leave, I realized why.  There was hardly anyone in the restaurant when we left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-10

Have always walked past this CPK but never ate here, until now. We had a party of 5 and everything was pretty solid. Our order, drinks, food, etc.. everything was taken care of and handled in a timely manner. We couldn't have asked for more really. I forgot whom the waitress was, but she was really friendly and made our experience here solid. Also, I'd like to note on how clean the place was, and very lively as well. Very nice environment, one of the better CPK's I've been to. Next time I come here, I've made it a note to take advantage of the bar area, as there was no one sitting there. Overall, great place from start to finish. Do come here if you're looking for a cool sit down for lunch without the high-ish LA prices.

There were thousands of (for lack of a better word) ""Red Shirts"" along with friends and family. And the few times I walked by before and after the rally there were nothing but Red Shirts inside.  After the Rally, there at least 50 people in my group and all of us were served and helped out with out any problem. Also, many thanks for them helping out the Union and PTA as a small portion of the proceeds went to help out or school.  Kudos to you CPK!

Spotless T.,"Irvine, CA",21,51,17,5.0,11/11/2015,"I just had the best service at CPK ever!  My husband and I just love dining at CPK, they offer delicious food and a wide variety. Tonight was absolutely Devine. It started with the hostess who immediately seated us and reviewed some new items on the menu. Our server Dave, came over quickly after. He was full of energy, took our drink orders and served it within minutes. When we mentioned it was our first visit he made note of that, took our order and confirmed what we ordered along with our special requests. Very shortly after, the manager, Gloria, came over to introduce herself and welcomed us. In less than 2 minutes Dave walked by and served us with a complimentary Spinach and Mushroom Flatbread. We had their BBQ Chopped Chicken Salad and from the many times we have ordered this in the past, it never tasted this good! The ingredients tasted so fresh and the lettuce was cold and crisp. We then received the Tequila Chicken and Lime Fettuccine and the noodles were al dente, the sauce was savory and flavorful without being too heavy. My compliments to the chef! Overall, I am ecstatically jumping for joy inside as I just moved down the street and will now be making this a regular stop for dinner.

Homegirl had tequila shrimp pasta and I got Kung pao shrimp spaghetti--ssssoooooooo good.  I was like why don't I eat more pasta?!?!  I'm not the biggest fan of spaghetti but it was aaahhhhh-mazing.  My dish was spicy and sweet, but I wish it had more shrimp.  The Appleberry sangria was tasty also, I'd recommend it.   Overall great experience.

Stephanie B.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",107,1331,1652,4.0,7/23/2012,"CPK has better than average salads, and this CPK has very good service.  It is open 7 days a week, which is a real benefit in this area of downtown, because you can grab lunch before seeing a show at the Music Center and avoid Patina's disappointing food and outrageous prices.  It is in the Center Court of the Wells Fargo Building, and there are oodles of tables - inside and out. We came in yesterday for lunch.  M and I split the Morrocan Chicken Salad, which is chopped romaine tossed with dates, cranberries, avocado, almonds, chicken, beets and butternut squash in a champagne vinaigrette.  Perfect to split, this huge salad was not overly dressed and was packed with flavor from all of the unique ingredients and seasonings.  DH had the carnitas pizza, which was delicious.  The crust was fresh and crispy, the cheese was gooey and the meat was tender.  What more can you ask for?

Caramelized Peach Salad:  Marilou C liked this salad a lot.  We actually came back the week after because she wanted the same salad.  I liked it at first but got tired of it after a while.  Not sure if the peach was fresh, maybe it's from the can.  I did like how they added blue cheese to the salad. Four Seasons Pizza: Thin crust pizza with tomatoes, artichoke hearts, salami, mushrooms, onions, Mozzarella and fresh Mozzarella topped with herbs and parmesan.  It was kinda good.

Today my boss was ordering lunch, so I told her that I'll eat what she eats.  So I ended up with an order of Singapore Shrimp rolls and a half-sized original bbq chicken salad. Shrimp, baby broccoli, soy-glazed Shiitake mushrooms, spinach, carrots, rice noodles, bean sprouts, green onion and cilantro wrapped in rice paper. Served chilled with a sesame-ginger dipping sauce and a side of Szechuan slaw (Does Szechuan really mean a dish of chopped raw cabbage? If i were in China i wouldn't dare to eat any produce raw.) the original bbq chicken salad is pretty tasty: Chopped lettuce, black beans, sweet corn, jicama, cilantro, basil, crispy corn tortilla strips and Monterey Jack cheese tossed together in herb ranch dressing.

We were only seated for about an hour total. Further, the bathroom shares the same door as the area where the servers bring dirty plates to the kitchen. One particular server kicks the door open without warning, not knowing that somebody may be on the other side of the door. I've been here several times and I understand it gets busy but safety and courtesy shouldn't be forgotten in the process. Plus, CPK is a sit-down restaurant in the middle of downtown LA.

However, we were seated right away. Our drinks and bread came out soon after that. We share an order of spinach artichoke dip and a margherita pizza. The food was brought out quickly. Fast and friendly service.  The only reason this was a 4 star and not a 5 is because the dip was more runny that what I am used to from other CPK's and the crust on the pizza was a bit more chewy than other thin crust pizzas that I've had at other CPK's. I understand it could have been an off day, so I income back and it's better, I'm more than happy to edit this to 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-10?start=40

The manager comes over to have a ""discussion"" with me instead. He asked if there was a problem. I explained that I could not find any chicken on the plate and he responds that their policy is 2.5 ounces per plate. I feel like I should have asked him for a magnifying glass instead. Clearly the food portions here are based on scarcity such as one would have found in post-war restaurants in Europe. BTW this restaurant was virtually empty when we arrived at about 5pm and when we asked for a better seat near the big window, we were given a lame explanation why we couldn't sit there.

They put bottled water on the table to entice customer to purchase bottled water. Table tops are dirty and sticky. Here's the bottom line:  There was nothing in this visit that was pleasant.  The service was not good or friendly, the food was cold, soggy and oily, the wine was not a good buy, the portions on everything were smaller and food pricing is high.  We will not be back to this or any other California Pizza Kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-10?start=60

sylvia k.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,32,24,3.0,3/1/2012,"I came here last night with my sister and her boyfriend, STARVED and ready to enjoy dinner at a restaurant chain we usually enjoy very much: CPK. First of all, there is no sign outside of the Wells Fargo center so if it's your first time here, you will probably have a really difficult time finding it. We tried calling the restaurant multiple times to ask for directions but no one would pick up. After driving up and down Hope St. we finally just parked (it was about $4 an hour for street parking) and decided to walk into the Wells Fargo center to ask for directions. Lo and behold, it was up the stairs inside the building. We felt pretty stupid lol. So we walk in, and there is no host or anyone at the front to seat us. We stood there for a few minutes and a really friendly employee ran towards us and apologized for the wait and sat us at a table near the window. He told us a server would be with us in a minute. Fifteen minutes later, no server. So we flagged the guy who sat us down and got our drinks from him. Another ten minutes later, I got really frustrated and asked the manager if we could order. He was extremely friendly and started helping us, and at this time the waitress comes over and starts asking us if we'd like to order...in the middle of us talking and ordering from someone else. Wtf? We ordered our favorites: I got the Chicken Tequila Fettucine & Wedge Salad, my sister got the Kung Pao Spaghetti, and her boyfriend got the Chipotle Chicken Pizza. We also got the Avocado Club Eggrolls for an appetizer. The Kung Pao Spaghetti was a disgusting congealed mess and it looked like bloated worms on a plate. I tried a little bit and gagged, and my sister took a huge bite and spit it back out. It tasted....really bad. The sauce was not right and the noodles were very overcooked. We sent it back but thankfully everything else that came out was perfect and tasted great. Throughout the entire meal, our waitress forgot things we asked her to get for us such as extra napkins, drink refills, hot sauce, lime, and etc. We had to keep getting them from the manager. The entire time we were there, we were really friendly but for some reason the waitress kept avoiding us like the plague and forgetting our things. We even took turns getting up a few times to grab things such as napkins or plates because we were short on them. Even the waitress that was working another section of the restaurant in the way back came over and asked us if we needed anything. Our own waitress couldn't do that? At the end of our meal, the manager could tell we were not happy with our waitress (even though we didn't complain about her, he is either psychic or has a good eye) so he gave us 3 snickerdoodle cookies on the house which was really nice of him! If they just got rid of that one waitress, I'd have no problem coming back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-10?start=60

The food is decent, but because it's Downtown, it's completely overpriced for what you get.  Or maybe their prices are consistent whether in the city or the burbs, IDK, but it feels high. Here's why they get 4 stars from me.  Customer Service.  I went here for a coworker's birthday lunch, and while the service was frustratingly slow, at the end of our meal, and kind of out of the blue, at least to me, 2 women from my party complained about their food so much that the manager comped both meals (despite the fact that the ladies had eaten at least 3/4ths of their meals. Then, the birthday girl had a couple of coupons - both of which the manager applied to the bill in addition to comping the 2 meals.  Lunch for 4 with tax came to about $24.  Of course we tipped 20% on the entire amount.  Frankly, I was embarrassed.  One of the ladies complained about the fact that they have recently switched from Pepsi to Coke.  YAY!!! I really dislike Pepsi.  She also complained about the new pizza crust, which I also liked. Anyway, kudos for letting the customer be right.  I'll definitely eat/drink here again for that reason alone. Also their sangria is the bomb.

I imagine this is a high rent location so be warned that cost cutting is most likely the primary objective in the kitchen staff's daily meetings.

While most of my coworkers remain tired of their meals and lack of nearby late-night options, I come here for a decent cup of tortilla soup and sandwich. The sandwich isn't anything special. The bread is typically of a onion or garlic base, with tons of shredded iceberg lettuce that loves to fall out of the sandwich. The sandwich is poorly put together. It needs a wrap to keep it together. I typically opt for the chicken, and let me add there's nothing special with that either. It's rather bland, but clearly a healthy choice, unlike the bread. The tortilla soup is good and chunky, despite the high sodium. I find the soup to be better than neighboring options that Dan's Deli or Mendocino may offer. You just get more for your money here as well.  Parking isn't a great option around here. You can park at meters along Grand or Hope, and it's free after 8:00 p.m. Monday-Saturdays (free Sundays).

The purpose of this selection was two-fold.  First I wanted to do a little carbo-loading for tomorrow's Rock n Roll Half Marathon, and second and most important I was really hungry having eaten nothing for seven hours since my 7 AM dim sum breakfast in Chinatown. Greeted and sat down at a booth next to the bar where I got to see a little college football on the television the service was cordial, friendly and fast.  They have pastas here too, but I really thought I would have room for more food later that night so I selected pizza instead. The Carne Asada Pizza was described quite well so that's what I went for along with a Peach Lemonade.  The peach lemonade was not too peachy and very sweet.  I should have stuck with plain water.  The pizza ( ), however, I loved.  It's grilled steak, fire-roasted peppers, onions, cilantro pesto and two types of cheese.  The crust could have been just a bit crispier, but I appreciated the fresh tomato salsa and tomatillo salsa served to the side.  The grilled steak was cooked medium and was extremely tender. As it turned out all that pizza expanded by all the liquids I consumed simply meant I felt comfortable enough to skip dinner.  I guess I will find out tomorrow if it sufficed.  Thanks CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-10?start=20

The half salads used to be really big but apparently they have reduced their portion. The salad is much smaller than I remembered and hardly worth it at almost $10. The pizza wasn't very good and there was an average of 2 little chicken cubes per slice. Sadly enough the best part of my meal was the mango iced tea.

Let me just say... service really lacks here. It took a long time for our table's drink orders to arrive. I was excited to get their Italian cream sodas, but was later informed that they ran out of cream so they couldn't make it. What?? What a disappointment. It never looks good when a restaurant runs out of ingredients for something on their menu. Especially when it's something as simple as cream! I opted for a Raspberry Cooler instead, which was mediocre. We also clearly asked for sugar for coffee a million times, which also took wayyy longer than it should have. We got so frustrated that we actually got up to get it ourselves! HORRIBLE. Our waiter disappeared plenty of times for long periods. It wasn't even too busy, so there's no excuse for such bad service! I forgot how bad their complimentary bread is, too. It can only be described as stale and cold.

Erica B.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,185,6,4.0,5/28/2009,"Alright, lets lay out the entire situation, just as it was...   So we were staying downtown and participating in the fun time they call the LA marathon, so there were tons and tons of people, it was a Sunday night, the night b4 the event and mind you there are very few places open in this part of downtown on a Sunday....   This place is a chain, (- 1 star sorry )                              BUT EVERYTHING ELSE ROCKED!  There were 7 billion people waiting to be seated (give or take a few thousand) the wait time was 30-35 minutes OR no wait time for the windy patio, we were STARVING and had a bigger party, so we said hey lets sit in the cold!Once we were seated they fired up some lovely outside heater lamps and all was good in the hood, half my face got toasty it was great :) We were seated immediatly, greeted promptly and everything was right on point, service, exact orders, and the waiter made sure to stop by every now and then, amongst the billions of people! FAVORITE PART:What I like, is when you say, ""can i please have extra veggies"" they hear ""she really really likes veggies, she must mean eXTRA veggies"" and for such a difficult demand my wish was granted... It was great, we will return next race around! High five guys!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-10?start=120

But I know that if I ever eat at a CPK, i'm never coming to this one again. When I came, it was pretty empty. So we thought at least we'd have quick service. They stuck us in a corner where no one was around. So no servers, waiters, anyone came walking by our area. We waited FOREVER for a server to come. There was another table nearby, and they went to complain because no server came around to them either. We finally ordered. They brought us cold, stale bread to munch on. The water there tasted like it could've come out of the toilet. My friend's water had things floating around in it. So we asked to change it, but again, it wasn't clear. We asked one more time, and guess what? same problem. We didn't want to make any more fuss, so we just shared a glass of water.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-10?start=120

Z Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,575,67,3.0,6/28/2007,"I have reviewed CPK before, I actually like CPK...but the reason why I have always loved it is because of the pear and gorgonzola pizza...it is fantastic...I have been ordering it for years.   This location is across the street from where I work so, the convenience of the location alone makes me frequent it for take out or for a quick lunch.  Last night I met a friend for dinner and didn't even look at the menu......why would I?  I always order the same thing...all of a sudden when we gave our order i suddenly had an out of body experience...holy heck, did the waiter just tell me they stopped carrying that pizza??????  is that really true????  denied the illustrious pear and gorgonzola pizza that i have been ordering for years?????  i was stunned, i needed a few minutes to compose myself and to figure out what else to order.  i actually thought about whether or not to just leave.  i felt like i had just been dumped by a close friend that i had involved with for years or like how i would feel if the White Stripes broke up....OK, I am being dramatic but you get the point....i loved that pizza....ugh, so i settled on some type of tortilla pizza which was good but it paled in comparison to my old friend who was just thrown off the menu and gone to the pizza graveyard.  The tortilla pizza was all mushy cold, not like the my ole dead buddy, he was delicious cold...he never let me down even once. Aside from my pizza trauma, I had a nice time.  It wasn't crowded at all, although just as a heads up it gets insanely crowded here during the day around lunchtime.  The waitstaff is always nice and the service is prompt. except that take out can sometimes take a while though, I have had then tell me it can take up to an hour during the lunch rush.  I did get Paul a pizza to go last night and it came pretty darn quick, before we were even finished eating.   Normally I would give CPK four stars but I just had to deduct a star for throwing my pizza off the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-10?start=120
Gil K.,"Torrance, CA",37,439,26,4.0,5/8/2008,"Right next to my apt, it's perfect for walking distance. This place is great. I order ahead and pick up, or I'll walk in with minimal wait time and I am served fast. The service at the pick up area is always great, there is this one lady in particular that does a great job at making me feel welcome by asking if I need anything else (typical, but sometimes it's hard to find).  I usually get the Milan Neopolitan pizza. It has a variety of sausage and meats taht are both sweet and spicy. Thin crust too. I also love their Whaldorf salad (sp?), it's got walnuts, cherries or cranberries, bitter spring mix, blue cheese, it's just a great salad and their half is so big, i couldn't finish it. Also, their pasta was really good one time, it's a penne pesto. the picture made the pasta look green because of the basil, but when my cousin was given his meal, it was more of a wheat color. Kind of unexpected, but the taste was creamy and smooth. Their vietnemese wraps are good too, but it's got kind of a PF Chang flavor, sweet and glossy, so take that with a grain of salt.  Overall, I'm impressed with this location. Clean, up-beat and really bang out some good food. I will continue to come here. Pros: location! consistent food Cons: sometimes server waited a bit too long to come back to us, but probably just busy.

I live downtown so usually eat here after the business men have left or on the weekends. As such, you would think the service would improve, and the food would come hot and fresh. The service here is just plain slow. The food doesn't taste anywhere as good as other CPKs. Maybe it's because it comes out cold. But that still doesn't explain why the flavor is lacking so dramatically here.
