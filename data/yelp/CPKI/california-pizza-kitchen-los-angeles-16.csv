Leticia A.,"Los Angeles, CA",126,5,,4.0,10/16/2017,I love this place but if you're on a time limit (lunch hour) make sure you're ready to order.  I recommend you request your check when you order. Some servers are a bit slow or if your seated in a corner they may forget about you.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-16?start=20
Keilab A.,"Lahaina, HI",9,200,228,4.0,11/27/2016,"Just like any other chain of CPK, this convenient location is great for college students. The waitress I had was very attentive and the ambiance of the restaurant was nice. I ordered the bolognese spaghetti and it was pretty good, but the size is a little small considering how much the dish costs.

Roger B.,"Westwood, Los Angeles, CA",1,6,7,5.0,10/21/2017,We live in the neighborhood & come here often because the food & drinks are good & the service is outstanding. Tonight Susie tried something new & really wasn't enjoying it. The manager insisted on replacing it with something she liked. We really appreciate the extra effort made here.

Jamie W.,"Los Angeles, CA",235,103,123,4.0,2/14/2017,"Been coming here a lot and still lots of stuffs want to try. The menu is huge with a wide selection pizza flavors, but I actually like those non-pizza items better. They are pretty tasty, with the downside that everything is pretty high in cal. This location is always very popular during lunch/dinner time. I guess the fact their menu is so big and tasty appeals to a very wide demographic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-16?start=20
Celeste P.,"Los Angeles, CA",123,124,7,1.0,4/7/2017,"I want to give this place a chance. But after half a dozen visits over the years, I'm consistently disappointed.  Lunch service today: My friend ordered fish tacos. I ordered soup & salad lunch combo. Took 40+ minutes. Server gave no heads up about that or any acknowledgements to us besides replacing the dirty flatware and plate we requested. No apologies from the server. Because of our bad experience, my friend tried talking to the server for a discount. Server said he couldn't do it. We only have 1 hour for lunch and had to return to work. Hence no time to speak w/a manager. Bad service and late food delivery = poor rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-16?start=20
Amy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3598,621,864,4.0,11/28/2015,"Despite its name, I don't come to CPK for their pizza. It's their pasta that keeps me coming back. I always opt for the angel hair with asparagus and spinach. It's sooo good! A simple dish with lots of flavor and pretty healthy to boot. I love how they always put a ton of garlic on top. And, I get it without the cheese. Not a fan of cheese on pasta, but chili flakes are a hell-yeah! The spaghetti bolognese is also a good dish! This one is for the meat lovers.  As far as the pizza goes, I would pass considering there are two pizza joints in the same area that serve way better pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-16?start=20

Isaac Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",699,7,,4.0,4/24/2017,"I came here with a couple of friends for a birthday dinner. Overall, service was good. The atmosphere is definitely family oriented, with an older crowd despite it being right next to UCLA.  The food was good and portion sizes were amazing. I tend to eat a lot and this definitely filled me up. Only drawback to this place is that it's a bit pricey for the food. I would much rather go somewhere else since the bill tends to be around 20 per person with tip. I ordered the California Club pizza which had: Nueske's applewood smoked bacon, roasted chicken and Mozzarella, hearth-baked then topped with avocado, wild arugula, fresh torn basil and Romaine tossed in lemon-pepper mayo.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-16?start=20

Brian W.,"West Los Angeles, CA",296,1703,5,3.0,1/29/2017,"Quite standard for a CPK. Perhaps a tad nicer, a tad more busy, but what else is there to say?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-16?start=20
Adrienne B.,"Tujunga, CA",149,171,196,4.0,4/15/2016,"I was in the Westwood area at UCLA for my dad, so I decided to treat my parents out to lunch and we stopped here. When we arrived, it wasn't too busy, and not too empty either, we were greeted by two hosts, who took us to our seats without any issues or wait time. When we approached our seating booth, the table and the seats were dirty, seemed like they clean up after the last table and just immediately wanted to seat the next group, so we asked the hostess if they could clean it before we sat, she simply took her hand and brushed everything away as if it was never there (How unsanitary). Anyway, our server was Jake. Super nice! I ordered the Fresh Strawberry Mango Cooler, so delicious! The bar had to make our drinks, so we were given waters in the meantime. Since we came around lunchtime, the lunch menu combo was the best choice for us. I ordered the Original BBQ Sandwich (Full), with a side of Caesar salad. The sandwich was delicious! Everything we ordered was well cooked, tasteful, and fresh.  Overall a good experience. I would have expected the bill to be more expensive because of location wise, but it was well worth the service we were given!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-16?start=20
Robert B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",119,291,394,5.0,3/30/2016,So I come to CPK not infrequently.  Love the pizza but often feel guilty because it is so good I devour it.  Tonight I made a healthier and amazing choice.  Halibut over butternut with asparagus on Farro!   Wow!  It was incredibly good.   One of my recent favorites.  My wife had Kung pao spaghetti and said it too was excellent!   Wonderful service and right down the street from my Bruins and DD Reese cookies!  I resisted that temptation tonight but highly recommend this yummy cookies too!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-16?start=20

Hannah N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",196,70,713,4.0,6/22/2016,"It's a chain so my I'm adjusting my expectations.  Positives: They accommodate large parties well. Good for banquets (15-20 people).  Hostesses and waitress were nice. The waitress even split our bill 15 ways-wow! Chicken tequila fettuccine is my favorite thing. Nice and cheesy with a twist of lime. Yes.  Decent prices.

Mylinh S.,"Oxnard, CA",49,133,471,4.0,2/27/2016,"Westwood just isn't as bubbly as it once was. We hadn't been here for a while and wanted to have dinner at a couple places we used to frequent:  they are gone! So CPK it is.  We sat at the pizza bar as we did not want to have to wait 30 mins for a table. Seems like everyone is coming here: young, old, funny looking... All tables are taken.  Ruby came and took our drink orders and our food orders. She brought us bread and olive oil dip to share while we wait for our food.  We sit right where the pizza chefs create their pizzas. Watching them work is a treat! This is where we will sit from now on! Pizza - the works:  3.5 stars. Not as flavorful as expected.  Bolognese spaghetti - 3.5 stars. Sauce is flavorful, but they didn't put enough of it on the noodles so the dish is dry.  Garlic cream fettuccine - nothing spectacular, but it isn't bad.  Kung pao spaghetti -  like! Not a greasy or salty as I remembered.  Quinoa arugula salad - five stars. I seriously am going to go home and try to make this. So good.  Typical CPK quality food. The service here is exceptional. I would come back again for the quinoa salad and the service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-16?start=20
Elyse E.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,83,1,3.0,7/8/2017,"This location has a nice fun feel to it.  The servers are great and fun energy.  Well, for the food, pizza is bland, salad was so plain and not a good value for lack of flavor.  We would go back if we have no other place to go and we are with friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-16?start=20
Arezou A.,"San Francisco, CA",437,388,291,4.0,1/24/2016,"CPK is a chain, and with all good chains, I like to rate primarily on the service because the food is pretty standard. If you have never been to CPK, it's a California pizza joint. What do I mean by California pizza? California cuisine has been characterized by fresh, healthy, local ingredients and beautifully designed dishes. CPK stays true to the cuisine by delivering that in its dishes. Service at this CPK is pretty great. Very attentive and came by often. Only issue was my water cup did not get equal amount of attention- boo. Otherwise, I love the option of sitting outdoors or indoors. Great place to have a work meeting- just the occasion I came here for. During lunch, they have lunch specials which are some of CPK's selected pizzas or sandwiches in smaller portions with a salad. Great way to eat pizza without feeling too full.  I ordered the lunch special (note: you cannot try substituting any of their other pizzas, I tried and failed) with the classic BBQ chicken pizza and a caesar salad. Definitely was still pretty filling, even though the pizza was smaller than normal. You could probably take two slices home still if you hold yourself from overeating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-16?start=20
Katie B.,"San Diego, CA",335,181,393,4.0,2/19/2015,"This CPK location appears to be freshly remodeled with a contemporary California vibe. The layout is pretty open, but surprisingly not too noisy. I came in to have lunch with my mom while we were in the area, and it was an overall good experience. We shared a half Roasted Veggie Salad and Thin Crust Margherita Pizza. The salad had a good variety of roasted vegetables atop romaine and avocado. We ordered the vinaigrette on the side, which was perfect since the salad already had a lot of flavor. The pizza came out nice and crisp, just as thin crust should be.  All of the staff was friendly and quite helpful, they even held the door open when we entered AND when we left (I often find this only happens on the way in).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-16?start=20
Leighton P.,"Los Angeles, CA",201,60,17,4.0,4/24/2017,"A nice location with the classic CPK menu. I always get the BBQ chicken pizza with the mango iced tea. I've also had the butter cake and spinach artichoke dip which are both amazing if you're in the mood for it.

Robert G.,"Los Angeles, CA",110,140,64,4.0,9/18/2015,"Foodbat CPK is delicious. I like the location, it's on a busy pedestrian corner in Westwood, sit outside, it's great for people-watching.  You can't go wrong with the pizzas here. The issue is that every time I go to CPK, one pizza is not enough for 2 people, 2 pizzas is too much. I suggest splitting a delicious appetizer such as spinach artichoke dip or the rolls. Then get a pizza, the Mexican pizza is pretty interesting, but they're all tasty options. Also, they have a decent selection of desserts.  The one thing I dislike about CPK is the prices. I always feel like I spent 15-20 dollars more than it was worth. If you can hold on until later in the night, happy hour deals on drinks can help!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-16?start=40
Scott K.,"San Jose, CA",246,110,41,3.0,5/31/2016,"The service here is kind of spotty. The waiter was kind of weird. I think he kept avoiding us because we were talking about Game of Thrones and he was an episode behind. If CPK can make sure that all their waiters are caught up on all my favorite HBO series so I can talk about them freely with my friends and also get regular refills on my water, that would be great, thanks. I don't like to compromise. Oh and their food is expensively mediocre (mediocrely expensive? I give up man.

However, the last time I came I really enjoyed the selection of food my colleagues and I decided to share.  First, I highly recommend the BBQ Chicken Salad. It is soooo good and filling. You will not feel bad after eating this and the half size is perfect for lunch.  This particular visit, I shared this salad with three other women. It was perfect because we also shared a pizza. I was skeptical at first about our pizza choice but once I tried the Gorgonzola-Pear Pizza I was hooked! It was sooooo delicious. There's almost a salad right on top of it that you eat with the pizza. It's just perfect!  If you want to try an out of the ordinary kind of pizza, try this one for sure.  The service is pretty good, it feels like it fluctuates sometimes.

Midnight B.,"Los Angeles, CA",62,303,28,2.0,12/21/2016,I have been a long time fan of CPK. Used to be the place of my friends and I would go to get some good pasta and sandwiches. But lately it's really gone downhill especially this location. I've had a few instances of dining in and a few orders via Grubhub and they were all terrible.  One chicken tequila pasta came it was so oily it was completely inedible. The pasta was also extremely under cooked. Another time I ordered a chicken piccata and the chicken was tough and chewy. And again pasta undercooked. This is not the quality it used to be. Very disappointing.  I don't think the Brentwood location is there anymore but that one was always a bit better.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-16?start=40
Tim H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,1,1.0,3/1/2017,"I usually like CPK, but this location is disgustingly dirty and unsanitary. Here's what happened... My dad and I went for dinner earlier this evening.  We were seated at a 4-person table, just the two of us, which was nice to have extra room. There was a stack of 4 plates on our table, ready for us to use, with wrapped silverware neatly on top. As we grabbed plates off the stack, we both noticed each one was very obviously dirty. Normally I don't check things like this too closely (maybe I should), but in this case there was physical food and food stains stuck to all 4 plates. We wiped some of the stains off the 2 cleanest looking plates and used those because we normally don't like to be a pain. Then, when we got our waters, mine had something floating it. It was relatively small and looked like a piece of food or something. Again, I decided not to bother complaining, pushed it to the side, and just stuck with my wine. Then, and here's the kicker... as my dad was almost finished eating his pasta dish, he found a shrimp tail in it (yes, just the tail). This is especially gross considering that the dish he ordered does not have any shrimp in it (he got the wild mushroom strozzapreti). He showed the waitress, and she said ""oh, wow, that's not supposed to be there."" She took the plate away, and the manager came over to apologize, saying ""we have so many pans going back there, it must have flung out of one of the shrimp pans and landed in the pasta"".  Oh great... now we feel much better...  Anyway, since they had already run my credit card before we noticed the shrimp tail, she offered a gift card worth the price of his dish. Thanks, I guess? Needless to say we won't be using it at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-16?start=40
Sharon Y.,"Santa Monica, CA",22,374,2100,4.0,10/2/2014,"Not a huge fan of chain restaurants so I typically forget about CPK when deciding where to go for lunch, but every time I come here the food is consistently good. My favorite entree is the Moroccan-spiced chicken salad, which has a great combination of colors, textures, and tastes - chicken, butternut squash, beets, dates, toasted almonds, red peppers, and cranberries with a champagne vinaigrette dressing. Normally I don't like getting salads because I'm not that much into lettuce, but this is a very hearty salad with plenty of protein, and every mouthful feels like an adventure. The half portion is more than enough to fill me up. Had the spicy chicken tinga quesadilla the last time I was here, and while it wasn't spicy at all, it did taste good and felt much lighter than TLT fare (makes me shudder to think of what TLT's calorie count could be). The tortilla was perfectly crisp and the cheese was perfectly melted.

I love all the little boutiques, and the theaters are just across the street. Parking as I said, can be a task. But I like the garage nearby with the first 2 hours free. And once you're here, pizza is the obvious favorite, but personally I love the salads and flatbread. I can't leave without enjoying a local beer or cocktail. As I write this review, strawberries are in season and the seasonal cocktail list has a number of tasty strawberry drinks. I like the strawberry mojito.

So I think they should call it Shrimp Scampi Squash with 2oz of pasta.  And let's not even talk about my fiancé pasta. But, I think it was better than mine. She ordered the the chicken Kung pao pasta.  Now, service was pretty slow even though we got there around 5pm when there is not that many people around Westwood village. And our server check on us right when we were about to leave and offered us more drinks but I think it was a little bit to late. The only good think that they have is the guy at the door.

Luckily they have free 2 hour parking in the parking structure adjacent on broxton! But definitely make RSVP's here if you're group is big otherwise prepare to wait for seating!

Yes even though the food did take quite some time to come out and not to mention alotta people were waiting for there drink orders too. But they this place was packed on a Sunday night so we'll give them some slack here. The food is pretty consistent and standard with all other CPK's.

CPK is definitely a familiar restaurant to both of us so we thought hey why not!  Since we had a few snacks on campus, we weren't too hungry. So, we decided to substitute our pizza craving and go for some small plates/appetizers. But first of course, we asked for the delicious complimentary bread.  The bread brought to us as the perfect golden, toasty, warm, and fresh out of the oven with a side of oil.   I ordered the spicy chicken quesadilla which comes with a side of spicy mayo under small plates and it was delicious! My friend ordered the shrimp lettuce wraps which was a great appetizer! We were both content with the meals we got.  At the end of our dining, our check took unusually long for our waiter to bring to us especially for being 3 pm in the afternoon and not very busy.

Andrew H.,"San Francisco, CA",148,593,546,3.0,8/19/2014,"I came here for lunch today with two friends (12:30PM on a Tuesday) and we were seated quickly, and had relatively good service. I ordered the wild mushroom pizza with truffle oil, while my friends ordered the Club (avocado/bacon, lettuce) and another wild mushroom but w/o the truffle oil. The bread was good, the dipping oil for the bread was nice, and the pizza was ""okay."" I do feel like the restaurant was extremely overpriced for what I got. I want to reiterate that these are very thin, single serving pizzas that any grown person will finish in one sitting, so don't expect leftovers.  To be more specific, let's take the mushroom pizza I ordered today for example.  I honestly wouldn't call it any tastier than a mushroom pizza at say Papa John's, and that truffle oil is certainly overrated. The mushrooms are chopped pretty tiny-like so you don't really get the great texture that you could get when it's prepared whole, and a pizza that's basically just mushrooms, cheese, and bread is a little bit lacking in my opinion. I left paying $18 (including tip) for my wild mushroom pizza + truffle oil, and I would consider it an extremely large price for what I got. This is a good establishment, as it's clean, the flavors are nice, and the variety is good, but honestly I can't recommend it because of their high prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-16?start=40

Marlene R.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,6,1,4.0,8/10/2017,"Conveniently located walking distance from the UCLA campus and from the Ronald Regan hospital, where my fiancé has been admitted for several months. Parking structure across the way and several metered parking spots on the streets.  Food is ok for a vegetarian. But not a lot of options for a vegan. Food is a bit above average from my vegetarian point of view.  I tried the soups and they were really great soups. If you like peas, I would recommend the pea and barley soup. It's beautiful made.   Pizza is nice and crispy and not too greasy.  Pasta, they customized it to fit my finances liking and let me tell you, it was perfect.  I always get the peach sweet tea and it's equally balanced to not be too sweet. It's my favorite.  First my fiancé and I were greeted and seated, being that it wasn't busy. Since he is still sick, he felt nauseous and I walked up to a waitress who right away got me a brown bag and used a plastic bag to line the inside for him to vomit in. She then goes back to the kitchen to get us water, and not just a glass of water but a bottled one. She was such a sweetheart. The part that I forgot to mention was that she was on her break, because I interrupted her while she was eating. I found out her name was Leticia.  She is primarily the reason why I decided to come back with my kids and mother along with the fiancé. That same week we went and we're hoping to have Leticia as our waitress, but lucked out.  It was a really busy day and full house both in and outdoor. Although the host wasn't as friendly or fast to seat us we managed to find a spot outside. Our food wasn't fast to come out either as the first time around but the store manager Kelly was quick to come out and greet and meet the guests. She had such a beautiful aura surrounding her. Her smile said it all and the way she talked to us, especially my fiancé and kids. She cheered for his recovery and welcomed him to the restaurant and said if he needed anything that she would be there. She was a complete stranger but the many times she walked up to our table or helped the waitress bring the food or drinks, she felt like a friend. She said if my fiancé felt to sick to stop by that they delivered to the hospital and even gave us her business card along with 2 cards for a free small plate.  Kelly, you made our experience that much more enjoyable and welcoming. You are a beautiful human being.

However, I will say that there is always something about the service that takes away from the experience. On this specific occasion, I came with a group of 20 and we made a reservation well ahead of time. It still took an hour for us to be seated. That being said, I don't like dwelling on the bad, so let's talk about that Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pizza. And oh man, is there a lot to talk about. The crunchiness of the crust, the perfect blend of toppings and that little kick at the end of every bite to keep the meal interesting.  It's no secret, I am a lover of spicy food, but I am definitely in it for the taste more so than the sweaty thrills. This pizza did not disappoint.

I was in the area so I decided to meet up with a friend for lunch. The minute you walk you where greeted with a nice hello. I asked the hostess if we can seat outside. No problem. After being seated outside the server came over and took are drink orders. After couple minutes later we decided to order are food. So we ordered the Thai Chicken Salad. Also the Thai Chicken Pizza. After 15 minuets the salad came out. The salad was try and extra dressing was needed. So then another 10 minutes go by then the pizza came out. The pizza not even cooked enough that you can eat. After looking at the pizza we decided not eat it. So we told the waitress if you can please get the pizza more done.  Another 10 minutes the pizza comes out again not done. Not one time did the waitress or the manager say sorry about your pizza. Can we offer you something different. When you have a restaurant you can't expect the food to be 100% The service was good. I just wish management would took more time to address the pizza or take off the check. As a loyal CPK this my 3rd time having issues with the Thai Chicken Pizza.

Tremaine E.,"Los Angeles, CA",561,263,316,3.0,2/4/2017,"CPK is like the video game my parents bought for me when I was 5 that I played two times and immediately ditched for ""Super Smash Bros"". CPK is like the class I took at UCLA only because it fulfilled my ""Scientific Inquiry"" requirement and because it was only a three minute walk from my last class--walking stinks, am I right? CPK is like the brown napkins the fast food restaurants sometimes have that is kind of coarse when you run it across your mouth but it's better than nothing. CPK is like the friend who hyped up a hangout for months but ends up just hitting me up to ""walk to the laundry room together"". CPK is like the show that comes on after Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune. CPK is like the realization that you want to buy the fancy $3.99 hand-made pasta at Ralph's imported from Italy but can't necessarily justify the cost and instead settle for the $1 Kroger version. CPK is like the jeans you really like but get shrunk in the wash so it is really hard to put on again but you know you just gotta lose a few pounds and you'll be able to squeeze in and stretch it out to somewhat normal size. CPK is like when you're on a roll and making some great jokes to your friend on Messenger and they just respond with ""lol"" and ""haha yeah"" and that annoying thumbs up emoji. CPK is like when you are totally for saving the environment but still feel greatly inconvenienced not getting free plastic bags at the store and then realize you're sort of a bad person but hey, at least you're well-meaning. CPK is like when you go to the car wash that you always go to since it's good and cheap at just $8 for a premium wash, but then you realize they raised the price up to $9 and you're bummed but that's still a decent deal and you're already there so you might as well still go through with it. CPK is like when a club on campus promises ""free food"" at a meeting and you convince your friend to go and they end up running out of the one pizza they ordered and you feel rude so you have to stay and you feel guilty because your friend is texting and isn't making eye contact with you.

Megan J.,"Riverside, CA",39,221,529,3.0,10/4/2016,"I met my friend here for dinner last night and we had a pretty good dining experience.  I hadn't been to this location in a really long time, but when I walked in, the restaurant looked updated and nice (looks like the floors and walls had been totally redone) and everything looked clean.  When I met my friend at the table, she already had a water, but it took awhile for me to be greeted for my first round of drinks. I was chillin, so it was no biggie to me, but CPK could be a little faster with that.  Our server was super nice and pretty on top of it the whole time.  My friend and I both had the ""Blood Orange Sangria"" and I thought that this was really good. It wasn't overly sweet and tasted fresh.  The bread and olive oil is good that they bring in the beginning. For my dinner, I had the full ""Thai Crunch"" Salad (crisp veggies, cilantro, chicken, peanuts, wontons, rice sticks, peanut thai dressing) and I added the avocado. I thought that this salad was quite good. The ingredients were fresh and it had nice flavor with a solid large portion. However, for what it was I felt it was on the pricier side (~$20 after the added avocado). For dessert we tried the ""Salted Caramel Pudding"" (caramel pudding, black cocoa cookie crumbs, whipped cream, caramel sauce and sea salt), which was delicious! It was a pretty unique dessert, wasn't overly sweet, and had a great balance of flavors. We were celebrating my friend's birthday, so they put a candle on it and made it nice.  During our dinner, a rather sketchy character stood by our table and talked/raised his voice at us. I know this isn't CPK's fault, but if something like that happens, then a staff member should jump on that immediately.

If you're unsure of what to order, the lunch combination is a great idea. I got a lunch sized pizza (mushroom pepperoni sausage) and a salad (Caesar).  The pizza was a decent size for lunch. It comes packed with mushrooms and pepperoni. They definitely don't skimp you there. The salad was whatever. It's really basic and the croutons were hard as a rock.

The pizzas are good though; I recommend those. Kids Mac n Cheese is close to 1000 calories which is frightening, however it tastes good and is made fresh.

I did not recall that and I have had both.  The chicken was not only dry, it was way over cooked and hard on top.  I don't know if he told them not to put garlic sauce on top , which I did not ask him to do, only no additional salt.  There was very little of the lemon garlic sauce and maybe that is why the chicken was tough and dry.  I only ate half and took the other half home.  I just warmed it but no, I am not eating it.  Tough, dry and over cooked.  The veggies were fine.  I did not send my meal back because my friend and I had tickets for the Geffen to see a play and I did not have time to wait.

The spaghetti noodles were al dente! Their bread is always nice and hot, fresh from the oven every time we go their. I also like how they do not season their herb olive oil mixture they use for the dipping sauce for the bread. This allows the customer to put as much salt and pepper into it as they want. Also their baked potato soup is pretty good. I like how many bacon pieces they put in the soup. They are quite large and really give the soup a bacony flavor. The potato's are soft and melt in your mouth. Also the broth is thick and creamy and tastes really good. I like the addition of the scallions in the soup as it adds to the flavor. But the soup is very heavy due to the cream and bacon. I think it could be lightened up if parsley was added to the soup. It would add a freshness and lightness to the soup counteracting the heaviness of the bacon and cream.

Michael S.,"Los Angeles, CA",189,205,5,2.0,8/27/2014,"This review isn't based on the food or the service, which were decent, but on the fact that they allowed a customer to bring a dog inside.  The dog clearly was not a service dog, as the dog was tucked into the woman's purse, however after about ten minutes the lady brought the dog from her purse and put the dog on the booth sofa and the dog.  Other than being against the law, it just gross to have a dog on the booth and have his/her paws on the table. The bigger issue was no one said anything about it, not the waitress, not the manager, they just pretended that nothing was wrong.  Don't get me wrong, I love dogs, but if you want to bring your dog, then just go out and get a table in the patio and have the dog sit next to your chair.

After calling multiple times over the next week, one of the employees told me that the restaurant has a homeless problem and that homeless people often wander into the restaurant and steal things off the tables.  This seemed to be an odd business choice, especially since they have 3 greeters at the door.  So, I didn't buy that story.

That is understood.  However, I had a weird experience here.  I went to the bathroom just before the meal got started.  As I was washing my hands, out from the locked toilet comes one of the CPK workers.  Instead of standing in line behind me to wash his hands, he went right back into the restaurant.  When I went back to my table, we joked and said our eews!  I then went over to him and said that I saw him walk out of the bathroom without washing his hands.  He told me that he washed them in the work area (double eew). I've seen in countless restaurants the sign that says that workers must wash their hands BEFORE leaving the restroom.  If there is a regulation requiring this, then CPK in Westwood is not following it.  I don't care if these servers are Hollywood types or not. They should obey the law just like everyone else. To the tall blond buy serving in CPK, wash your hands BEFORE you leave the restroom.  If you want to wash them again when you get to the work area, that's fine.  There is no substitute for washing them in the restroom... and you just came out of the sh*!ter.  Ouch!

This time, I ordered the Arugula and Asparagus Salad, which is leaves of arugula with chopped asaparagus tossed with sundried tomatoes and topped with shaved Parmesan.  I substituted the Dijon Balsamic for the lemon vinaigrette, because I prefer the former.  The salad was delicious - lighltly dressed and tossed, as requested, with uber fresh veggies, creamy cheese, and some Marcona almonds for crunch.  Nice touch!  I also ordered the spicy sausage and poblano flatbread, which is a perfect alternative for pizza lovers who can eat their gigantic pies on their own.  An oval crispy flatbread is topped with spicy marinara, some cheese, spicy sausage, and tons of poblano rings.  The pizza was really flavorful, super crisp and not at all greasy.

So I was trying to be good and ordered the half size chopped salad, and a little carbs in the form of pita and hummus.  Salad was good, but in many ways unremarkable.  I liked how the menu displayed the calorie count, though.  That definitely steered me away from some of the higher calorie stuff.  The pita and hummus was also ok, but nothing you can't get on your own from Trader Joe's.  Which brings me to an interesting question: how much would one pay at TJ's for a similar meal?  Prepared salad, hummus, and a few pita breads.  Maybe half price?  Probably just as good?  I don't know about you, CPK.  I'll go again, but only if I'm dragged by my co-workers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-16?start=100

Ann S.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,7,,1.0,7/9/2017,"This experience could not have been any worse. At one point we found ourselves looking around to see if there was a camera capturing our reaction to everything. We got seated outside by the hostess. Finally after at least 15 minutes she came over and asked if we would like anything to drink and to say that she doesn't have a server for us but that she will take our order since when we sat down we told her we were ready to order. We ordered 2 waters, a salmon plate and an everything pizza without olives. Never got water till we finally flagged down a server who brought us water. After sometime our dinners arrived by someone who worked there but was not a server. How could you possibly get this simple order wrong? Finally we were able to flag down a server. Not ours since we don't have one. We were told by this server that the hostess who is new should have never taken our order. I have been to other locations but will never ever come back to this one.

I only found out finishing the pizza and looking at the website menu. Yes, I ate the pizza topping as a salad. Oops.  The gluten-free crust here tastes great but it's leather-tough. Forget the knife. You'll build biceps sawing through this. For the guys, maybe you'll have that hot angular jawline after all the chewing. ;) I'm still very happy they offer gluten-free crust. Very much appreciated! Interesting flavors. The sweet caramelized pears and onions melded well with the hazelnuts and gorgonzola cheese. The hazelnuts seemed to have a slight stale taste.  Perhaps not enough people order this for them to go through the hazelnuts quickly enough. Nonetheless, I would get this again.

When we were finally served, a couple of us got actually cold dishes, one of which was so bad we had to send it back. The guy who took it back had some attitude which didn't really make it better.

I was deciding between the Sicilian and the Pear+Gorgonzola but ultimately went with the Sicilian, because, who doesn't want meat on their pizza. This dough is piled with the perfect amount of meat and veggies. The Italian sausage was the best part. Perfect little pieces of a spicy and juicy sausage.

I tried a pasta in the ""Lite Adventures"" list and got the shrimp scampi zucchini fettuccine last night and really liked it. It was a good mix of veggies and light sauce. It was just enough food! I am definitely getting this again.  I like CPK because it offers good vegetarian options. The pesto penne pasta is a go-to for me (don't forget to ask to add some veggies!) or the veggie pizza is also great.

There was a time in life when I absolutely loved CPK, but they basically faded into irrelevancy over the last few years. Now they've updated their look with a softer, farm-to-table feel and added some cool, upscale items to their already solid menu. We had their Valentine's special which was 1 app, 1 full salad, 1 pizza, and a dessert for $32! I calculated it saved at least $10, which I used to buy a craft cocktail made with avocado (the new ""in"" mixer apparently). Everything was delicious! Even their new bread and olive oil to start is good - fresh and warm! Spinach & artichoke dip can't help but make you feel good all over, though some of our group preferred having bread with it rather than the chips with which it's served. Our server happily brought plenty of extra bread. The Thai salad is hearty and flavorful. I think the pizza crust has been re-worked to be more Neapolitan, it seems to me. It was thin in the middle, puffy on the edges, and had nice structure with a little char. What can I say about the butter cake with ice cream - it's just the most sinful of indulgences.

Rebecca T.,"Los Angeles, CA",110,181,200,4.0,4/11/2014,"Came here with my club group Thursday night.  The place was PACKED, not only because, well, it was Thursday (a day typically bustling with college night life), but also there happened to be a movie premiere for some new Johnny Depp movie. As expected then, the area was crowded, the streets were blocked, and parking was a nightmare. But I digress. CPK was filled with people, but we had reserved a table for seven. No wait, and the drinks and orders were accomplished relatively quickly. We ordered 4 pizzas (Hawaiian,  Mushroom-Pepperoni, Thai, and BBQ Chicken, I think), two salads (mixed greens with cranberries, walnuts,  and feta cheese and a Chinese chicken-like one. I don't exactly remember), and for me carnitas tacos. The tacos were surprisingly good. The pork had been fried, so it was at once crispy and tender. Had no regrets for adding avocados for an extra 99 cents. As for the rest of the food, I only had the cranberry walnut salad, but I enjoyed the taste of the balsamic vinaigrette and feta cheese, although CPK could have cut down on the amount of dressing. Had a slice of all 4 pizzas; my favorite would have to be the BBQ chicken. I found the Mushroom-Pepperoni too greasy and salty. Maybe it's because I'm not a huge fan of thin-crustedp pizza, but regardless, the pizzas were decent. Despite the crowded night, I had a pleasant, food-filled experience.

Annie G.,"Oakland, CA",116,250,15,1.0,12/17/2011,"It takes a lot of bad shit to fuck up a CPK experience.  And you know what?  I don't appreciate that at all.  OK.  Sorry, let me calm down. My friend and I came here one Saturday afternoon for some lunch.  First of all, the place kind of smells like Chuck E. Cheese.  Not very appetizing.  We waited about ten minutes for anyone to acknowledge our existence. And the waitress that did finally talk to us was very awkward and made us both very uncomfortable.  Don't get me wrong - I love a good awkward person.  But this girl was so awkward that she was sort of condescending.  It was bizarre. We order all our food and just sat there.  And sat there.  And sat some more. Until finally the waitress brings out some stuff we didn't order and says, ""Oh this is on the house!""  Like we're supposed to be grateful that any kind of food found its way to our table.   So we don't eat any of it because a) it's not what we ordered; and b) we actually want OUR FUCKING FOOD.   Everything finally comes out and it looks like it's been siting around for a while.  You know how salad dressing starts to bead up when it's been left out too long?  That's what was happening to both our meals.  My friend is so over the whole experience and she decided to get her salad boxed up without taking a bite.  I eat about half my salad and decide that if the salad isn't doing too well right now, it's probably not a good idea to box it up.  More time won't help that shit. And this is where shit got ugly.  I tell the waitress that I'm all done and she goes, ""Oh you didn't like it?""  Are you fucking kidding me?  Just because some pathetic salad is sitting in front of me, I'm supposed to eat the whole thing?  What if I was full from all the other shit you tried to feed me with?  Or if I had an eating disorder?   Even if I truly didn't like, you don't ask something like that, because then you're putting someone on the defense by trying to make them explain themselves.  It was just so shitty all around.  And it's making me question my love affair with CPK... not cool.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-16?start=180

I ordered bbq chicken pizza, the works, fresh green salad and the tri colour salad pizza. I liked the works - tasted like pizzas I ate in Korea before.

The salad never came - we didn't really ask about it because the salad pizza was pretty much like a salad by itself. I asked for the check after we were done and the check included the salad so we told them we never received it. They told us that it was JUST done being prepared - what? how can a salad take longer than 3 pizzas to be prepared?? We said we just wanted it off of our tab because we were done with our meal.

The dp was really good, but I wish they would use better chips, which to me, were a bit stale. The pasta was good, but they alfredo was just a tad too clumpy for my taste. The flavors on the pizza was good, but I really couldn't find any difference between the old dough and the new ""hand toss"" dough. Finally the dessert.  Originally I was going to get the key lime pie. I'm a suckered for a good key lime, but our server suggested that we get the butter cake instead. At this point the hostess chimed in and said it was the best thing the served. Our interest was peaked, so we ordered it. This was the saving grace of the evening. Before the dessert came out I'd ordered a glass of resling and it just wasn't right the would night. It tasted like a dry chardonnay, which I don't like. The resling I ordered was a favorite of mine, but it didn't taste right, even when they opened a new bottle for me. So the fact that the butter cake was so awesome, I forgive the bad wine.

After coming back for an anniversary dinner with my boyfriend to celebrate where we had our first date we had a horrible experience. I feel like CPK is going down hill.  We came in during dinner service, which we were sited in the very back. Hostess smiled and sat us down but felt like we were hauled like cattle. The waiter greeted us and asked if were ready - typical start of to any dine in restaurant. My boyfriend asked for any suggestions, the waiter responded by pointing at the menu and said ""here"" throwing the menu back at him.  We could tell he wanted to take our order and leave. Did not feel welcomed at all.  Food was ok, sad that the miso salad I normally ordered was no longer on the menu. The cobb salad my boyfriend ordered was not appealing at all. It was not tossed and it looked like it was just thrown on the plate - gross. I mean, salad is the easiest to prepare. It doesn't take that long to make it look good. The waiter never came back only til after we finished everything and 15 min and more waiting for him. We were completely ignored the entire time.  Normally I tip well because I also work in the food industry, so I know how hard it is to deal with customers and handling/juggling everything. But this is the first time I had to not tip! I will no longer be coming to this CPK. Sad.  Note: We also overheard that the waiter couldn't wait to quit since he already had a job interview and was waiting for a call back.

Very quietly without even a whisper replies ""the right over there"" without any direction to where ""there"" was. So I asked again to clarify that it was back against the back wall of the restaurant and in a very distraught way she says, ""yes ma'am"".  1. Dont call me ""ma'am"". I'm 18 yrs old. 2. Speak up so I can hear you 3. Dont give me attitude I'm a paying customer Im only asking where the bathroom is.... So I sit down with my friend and tell her about what happened and we were just kind of like wow wtf... So then the lady walks by and I flag her down because I needed some more water I was very thirsty. So I ask and say, ""Excuse me ma'am can I have some more water?""  Well the look she gave me was absolutely rude and disgusting. Not only that my water never came she purposely walked by with the water pitcher and it was full and never attempted to look at me or poor water into my glass. Its like after I called her ma'am she suddenly too became offended  but actually made sure I saw that, but the difference was she was like 30 something and I'm 18 you call me ""miss"" and I call you ""ma'am"". So we waited and waited and it became like a joke cause she never came with the water so I asked some waiter guy for water and it was there right away.  They werent busy. She wasn't busy.

Gloria C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/3/2009,"Horrific. As I'm seeing others have had similar experiences, I've come to the conclusion that this CPK. is. crap. As college students (which I'm guessing 80%+ of their guests are), my boyfriend and I weren't looking to spend $50 at a casual dining restaurant. Thus, he ordered a ravioli dish (which he calculated as costing 75 cents per ravioli...wtf?) and I a $9 cobb salad and a peach iced tea. As soon as we placed this initial order, the waiter had decided that we were on the bottom of his pyramid of patrons worthy of adequate service, and made sure we knew it. Service throughout the night was sluggish, rude, and otherwise non-existent. Being CPK newbies, we weren't even aware that complimentary bread was served until we noticed everyone around us got it [so contrary to others who got the generic ""we're out"" excuse, they DID have bread, we just weren't important enough?].  Fed up, I decided mid-meal to either ask the manager for a complaint form or look for some kind of ""HOW'S OUR SERVICE? CALL 800-CPK-LOVE"" number to let them have a piece of my mind. After being thrown a final quizzical look by the server when asking for a refill for my iced tea [which had been empty for a good 15 mins.] and our check, I found a link to a satisfaction survey. Oh, I filled it out, though not expecting anything to happen. ...the next day! I get a call from Nicole[?], the branch manager. After heartily apologizing and explaining that that's ""not what we're about"", she asked for my address so she could send me some coupons to use at the branch of my choice. She said she'd send it out that day. ...3 days later, nothing. Not that I'm planning on returning to ANY cpk (rude server is one thing, but a dishonest Branch Manager is on a completely different level of unprofessional conduct).  All in all, the food was pretty standard, by taste alone. Combined with the quality of service and the price, I'd say it's not worth it. My advice? Wait the 15-20 mins.

And of course you can't go wrong with their pizza!  They have a lot of random assortments of pizzas.  You can get a classic pizza (cheese or sausage) or you can try a chipotle chicken pizza (with a fantastic spicy chipotle chicken sauce), or an assortment of Asian-style pizzas with excellent sauces. The only pizza I woult not recommend getting is the goat cheese pizza... I am not a big fan of goat cheese, so it's not really the best thing to get, but it's really a matter of personal choice. I also highly recommend their appetizers!  Their spinach appetizer dip is really fantastic and you can share it with a group of people.  They have other dipping appetizers as well.

However, the service always seems to be lacking at this CPK, and pretty much every CPK I have ever been to. CPKs in general seem like they overwhelm their wait staff with too many tables because they are always difficult to find or flag down. The food at this CPK tastes the same as every other CPK.

I typically love tortilla soup, but the soup at CPK almost always gives me a horrible stomach ache so I avoid getting it.  If there is something that I would say that CPK does well it would be that they are consistent in all that they do. Their food is pretty good and tastes exactly the same regardless of which CPK you go to, and the service is consistently below average.  This CPK is no different than any other CPK I have been to, besides being a bit smaller.  If you are craving pizza in the Westwood area there are much better options, and the service here is just not up to par.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-16?start=200

Not to mention they don't like taking reservations, which understandably would be meaningless at a place as busy as this one. My biggest gripe is that the restaurant seems perpetually understaffed, and the quality of the food is definitely subpar compared to other CPKs (that's a problem considering how CPK is already overpriced and the food is normally run-of-the-mill). Like AIZIL, there was one time when they ran out of bread. How does a pizza place run out of bread?

The selection of these pies is broad, but I have to admit that the quality just isn't there. Sometimes I feel as if the same pizza could have been sitting in a freezer box prior to landing on the table. What they lack in quality is not made up in size. The pizzas are small and can leave you hungry. Portions for the pasta entrees are better, but I've never been wowed by anything I've ordered here.  Service: Somewhat slow, but tolerable. I've experienced waits of 15 minutes that turned out to be more like 5. Maybe they do this to appear busier than reality dictates.
