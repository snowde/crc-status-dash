She's funny and on top of her game. As a frequent Southwest flier, I'll be back, and I'll ask for Karen.  Food wise I'm familiar with CPK and ordered a BBQ chicken salad and some wine.

Subanti M.,"Atlanta, GA",651,32,60,1.0,9/19/2017,"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!! 1st there isn't a ton of food options for the Southwest Terminal 1, so you're pretty much stuck paying $20 for a personal pizza. I stood in line for 15 mins to order a BBQ Chicken pizza just to have the manager tell me it would take about 10 minutes to be ready, i said fine knowing my plane was about to start boarding in 20 minutes, i waited for about 12 minutes to come ask the other cashier if she has any idea where my pizza is, she said the cook hasn't even made it yet and it will take another 15 mins. I look over to see that the cooks literally haven't even started on the order yet and is making cheese pizza. I waited for 5 more mins after that but still seeing that the pizza isnt being made and they are not in a rush at all, i decided to take the plane cheese pizza instead and head over. The crushed pepper was empty and when I asked the cashier if she has anymore, since this was empty, she seemed like she could care less. The manager was taking orders on the other register and seemed like was in la la land and would rather be at a different place.  Since this location is at the Airport, you would think that they would care for other people's time and try to deliver the order to the customer soon since they have flights to catch but the staff there is just straight up lazy and would rather be elsewhere then work at this CPK. So disappointed and pissed!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-19
Jason G.,"Pasadena, CA",4425,2442,5446,3.0,1/13/2018,CPK has some pretty good pizza and some different takes on both classics and non-traditional pizzas.  I think they need to reinvent their pizzas a bit as there's a lot more competition now.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-19
Tommy M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",381,81,200,2.0,8/23/2017,"Not a ton of options in the Southwest Terminal 1 at LAX, so I went with old reliable CPK to go. Disappointed that Thai Chicken isn't one of the 4 choices, but mushroom & pep is always good.  I literally did a DOUBLE- take when I saw my pizza was gonna be $18.29 + tax. I have heard of expensive airport food, but this is outta hand!! I got a Coke Zero and my total was over $23 for a single serving pizza and a Coke!! That's WAY more expensive than a freakin Lakers game!! Well, at least if I spend that money, I'm gonna get some good pizza- right?! WRONG! My toppings were literally all crammed in the very middle of the pizza!  You can literally see sauce on over 1/3 of my pizza that's not covered in: cheese, mushrooms, or peporonis?!  Get it TOGETHER people!! Only reason they get a 2-star rating is because the staff taking orders is super friendly & super fast (which I appreciate in an airport)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-19
Lillian Z.,"Sacramento, CA",463,371,1431,2.0,6/30/2017,"Hmmm. This was a classic case of ""Beggars can't be choosers"" for me. This is a review for the grab and go pizzas. If you're looking for a review of the actual sit-down dining experience, I unfortunately cannot speak to that. I was arriving at LAX for a late night Southwest flight out of Terminal 1. With everything under construction, all of the food options have changed, so CPK it was for me. I wanted something I could grab pretty quickly since my flight was about to board, so I hopped in line for CPK. One good thing about this CPK is that they recognize that people at airports can generally be short on time, so they have pizzas ready made and boxed for you to take on your plane with you. That being said... these pizzas are grossly overpriced (I mean $17+ for a smallish personal pizza??) and clearly have just been chilling under the heat lamps in the boxes for a while.  And yes, I know... when you're dining at an airpot and you're in a hurry, what are you expecting? I generally like CPK when I go the regular, non-airport CPKs for a sit down meal, but I can't bring myself to give this CPK a stellar review. The margherita pizza that I ordered was essentially a cheese pizza with some basil on it. No tomatoes, no garlic, no additionally mozzarella cheese. Because I've eaten at regular CPKs, I KNOW they can do better. tl;dr: Beggars can't be choosers. I'd come back here again to grab a pizza to go if I was really in a rush, but be prepared to pay an arm and a leg for a pizza that's been sitting there for a while and is not up to normal CPK standards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-19
Karen K.,"Elk Grove, CA",1445,1118,18539,4.0,5/23/2017,"Decent food eats, convenience is all we care about while we are flying out of the LAX via Southwest Airlines. Now why haven't we tried you locally here in Sactown? Maybe bc ours is not located at our airport.  Remembered the first time we were here before it was time for breakfast. I had the sausage breakfast bagel that hit the spot. We took it to go so we weren't treated the same as if you were eating in the restaurant like we did recently. That's the reason for the four stars instead of five. Hubby had the BBQ chicken salad and I had the Cobb salad. It overall was pretty tasty & on point. I loved how they separated all the ingredients. Just ask my hubby that I eat items separately. I know it's very unusual. Maybe bc I'm very organized in my mind! I wished we could have taken it to go though. I couldn't finish it all but of course our flight was delayed so that nixed that idea. Great service was definitely a plus for sure! At least we know this for the next time. Remember three's a charm?

This was on my way to my next plane. I did not to other places as I wanted to grab something quick to eat. In other words I did not order a pizza or anything hot. I actually got one of their premade meals. I had the option of a sandwich or a salad. I decided on the sandwich since I needed something to last me. I got the pesto chicken. It took a while to get my meal checked out as a lady was in front of me asking the cashier question. They had two cashier but only one open. Eventually, they opened the second one and processed my meal. The bread of the sandwich was pretty thick in my option. The bread seemed to make The whole experience of meal seemed dry.

We told our waiter from the jump that we were probably gonna have to ""eat and go."" He made sure to rush our order in, and cash us out right away. He understood we were probably gonna be in a hurry and he took care of us no problem. Now, I'm sure he is used to do this, but we have all been to restaurants where they just didn't understand the urgency of the check.  Not only that, our food was delicious!! I don't expect much from an airport. But the food was crazy good and our cocktails were pretty damn good too. Very impressed.  Of course, you are in a airport. The food was definitely over priced...but what's new in an airport? The food was great, the cocktails were perfect, and the customer service was on point!

We ordered the first time she came over to us and the pizza took about 45 minutes to come out. Thankfully our flight was delayed or we'd almost miss it. I ordered a second glass of wine and it never came. Just not a good experience overall.

Chad K.,"Gretna, NE",18,450,462,4.0,7/24/2017,"Shockingly, I actually had good wait service here. That's almost unheard of for an airport eatery.  They even had fresh-brewed iced tea (something I kept struggling to find during my time in California). Pizza was also very good. I'm not sure why anyone would order anything here except pizza. Keep in mind that this is an airport, so prices will be elevated. Practice a little airport common sense and save yourself some frustration. If you don't have at least an hour until your flight boards, then don't bother ordering from places like this.

Emil C.,"Irvine, CA",413,1057,4137,3.0,12/24/2016,"Finally they have been doing a lot of remodeling since I last flew out of terminal 1. The restaurant options had changed a bit and I ended up at California Pizza Kitchen to eat a late lunch. Most of the employees working here seemed very unorganized and not well trained for each of their positions. I'm going to guess that most of them were all new hires. Once I got seated at a small table, I started things off with an iced tea. Then I ordered their Sicilian pizza. *Sicilian Pizza* I almost never ever order a pizza, but hey, it's in their name... when in Rome! It turned out to be a very tasty delicious pizza! Just the right size, however it was a bit pricey at about $19. Fortunately my waitress was pretty good. She was nice and refilled my iced tea when it was getting low. Overall I wouldn't mind eating here again as long as the food remains good, but they probably need to work on their employees and get them to do their jobs instead of checking their phones in the presence of customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-19
Janice J.,"Dallas, TX",530,122,227,3.0,12/28/2016,"The food was decent but the service was very mediocre and our meal was very pricey (but that's a given inside an airport). I was really excited about there being a California Pizza Kitchen in the middle of a small, domestic terminal (terminal 1) -- wasn't expecting there to anything but fast food. Food: Our family ordered the bbq chicken pizza, the chicken avocado club with a side salad, and the kung pao spaghetti (without meat because adding chicken/shrimp was an extra $3). The BBQ chicken pizza was decent, but nothing exceptional. I was actually pleasantly surprised by the Kung Pao Spaghetti -- I usually don't like ""Asian"" food served at restaurants not run by Asians but the noodles were very flavorful without being overly salty/sweet. The chicken avocado club and side salad were also decent. 4/5 Service: I think we saw our server twice the entire meal -- once when he came to take our order and once to deliver the check. Other than that, he never came by to refill our water (food and drinks were delivered by someone else), didn't even give us silverware (we had to flag down a random waiter to get our silverware), and never gave more than curt answers/never made eye contact when he did come by. 1/5",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-19

Sounds good, I saw the huge Starbucks line and would rather wait here. 15 min goes by, and nothing, 30 min goes by and still nothing. The workers completely ignored us. I overheard another one of the 20+ people now in line, as about the hold up, and they said ""we are waiting on the manager to bring up cash"". The patient customer then asked how long it would be, and the worker said ""they are on their way""... so another 15 min goes by and still nothing!!!!

We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, chicken dumplings, and shishito peppers. The spinach and artichoke dip was pretty standard. The chips definitely came straight out of a tostitos bag. The honey glaze on the chicken dumplings gave the dish flavor, otherwise the dumplings thenselves would have been bland. My favorite appetizer is the one with the shishito peppers. I always order the shishito peppers as an appetizer at any restaurant that serves them, because I like to compare how each restaurant dresses them up.

Ahmad J.,"San Francisco, CA",1277,675,1835,4.0,6/14/2014,"CPK is like an oasis in a Desert in the food court of LAX Terminal 1 when compared to other options available. I'm not a great fan of CPK but at-least you get fresh pizza made to order that comes to you piping hot. I got the Thai Chicken pizza ($12.89) and a naked juice smoothie ($5.25) so prices are exactly double of what you would pay outside but that is common across all spots in the food court. After ordering I was expecting a long wait as CPK seemed to be the preferred choice of most travelers which resulted in a long queue but surprisingly the wait was under 10 minutes. As expected I was not a great fan of the taste of the Thai chicken. It seemed to have some sort of bland tomato sauce masquerading as a Thai sauce which I felt sucked as it is not difficult to create a simple hot and sweet tomato based sauce that would be more representative of Thai flavor. Anyway they toss a bunch of thinly sliced carrots along with a sprinkling of sprouts to make up for the lack of Thai flavor. They do accept cards but are one of the few restaurants that do not take Amex. Of-course the server did not know this and instead loudly proclaimed that my Amex was declined so that was not pleasant (quickly fixed by providing another card).

I swore I wouldn't come again after last time, but I caved, and ended up having a worse experience than the time before. Do not come here unless you have a minimum of an hour to kill. Based on a half dozen or so visits, it always takes over 10 minutes after you're seated for somebody to come by and take your order. If you're ordering an alcoholic drink, expect another 10-20 minutes before that drink arrives. As far as your food, expect it 20-40 minutes after your order. You'll finish your first drink by then, but your server will not come by to ask if you'd like another drink. If you're lucky you can flag them down. Your food will be brought out by somebody who isn't a server, and can't take your order for a second drink.  The food is fine, drinks are good, selection is more than adequate. Service is just so awful that nothing could make up for it. When you mention the delay to your server they complain about how big their section is, a large party of people, or how busy they are. They absolutely never apologize or say anything to put you at ease. When I mentioned the 15 minute wait for my drink order this time I got the busy/large party excuse, and the waitress then the waitress pointed out another person and said they'd been waiting longer. That would be even worse than my 15 minutes, but I specifically saw that table get cleared and that exact person sit down. So it was a blatant lie, and again, no apology or anything to put me at ease. Just lies, excuses, and complaints.  Hopefully I'm never foolish enough to come back here again, but I'm at this airport in this terminal dozens of times a year, and there aren't many options. They kind of know you're stuck with them and act like you're lucky they even serve you at all. It leaves me feeling taken advantage of every time.

On 1/22 my 3 friends and I went to this location (Manhatten Beach) as we have gone several times in the past. Dinner was good, everything seemed fine. When the bill came, we split the amount 4 ways, the total for us all was $35 per person (which included tax & tip) 2 paid cash while the other two of us paid with our debit. I told the waiter to charge the two cards $35 each, the rest was cash and the change was his tip (20% because he seemed nice). He did that (So at least we thought). We left the restaurant everything was fine. Come a week later when I noticed on my bank account that I was charged $40. I called my friend who also had paid with a CC and the same thing happened to her. On January 30th, she called the restaurant and the manager, Walter Hastey, sure enough found the receipt. He emailed them to her for confirmation and we found out that not only had the waiter changed the amount, he had re-printed the receipt, and signed it as well! That was an extra $10 for our order plus committed forgery by signing our names! The manager, Walter Hastey, acknowledge the error to my friend and said that ""the conversation with the waiter was going to be awkward"" What about the customer who he committed fraud too??? Isn't that more awkward?? Yes it was only $5 each, but HE REPRINTED AND SIGNED OUR NAMES!!!!  How many times has this guy done it to customers before??????? He also said he would give both my friend and I a $30 Gift Card each for what we went through. Later that morning, I called the CPK Corporate offices (310-342-5000) to let them know what was going on at their establishment in Manhatten Beach, which I had to leave a message...twice!I received NO call back so later that evening I called the same manager , Walter Hastey, of restaurant my friend had spoken to, to ask what the outcome of the waiter was. At first he was NOT apologetic at all, he sounded bothered that I had called and he acknowledged that corporate had re routed the message to him. Keep in mind, I was one of the victims and he had never spoken to me before. When I told him it felt worse that I'm calling about the situation and he sounded bothered, he then changed his voice to sound like it mattered. He also told me that he was trying to make it right by sending us the gift cards like he told my friend(which he said would be put in the mail that night). He asked for my personal info so he can send mine directly to me (which now I dread giving it to him!) Well as of now, neither one of us has received anything! I'm not even sure to be honest that the waiter has been let go. he probably just got moved to another location! All I can say CHECK YOUR STATEMENTS FOR ANY PREVIOUS DINNING EXPERIENCES HERE! And as you can see, if there is any issues with CPK, neither the management nor corporate takes it seriously! GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE GUYS! I will be happily posting this to all CPK close to the area just incase the waiter was just moved to another restaurant location to make people aware of your company's business values and not let this happen to someone else again.

Lillian Z.,"Sacramento, United States",463,371,1431,2.0,30/6/2017,"Hmmm. This was a classic case of ""Beggars can't be choosers"" for me. This is a review for the grab and go pizzas. If you're looking for a review of the actual sit-down dining experience, I unfortunately cannot speak to that. I was arriving at LAX for a late night Southwest flight out of Terminal 1. With everything under construction, all of the food options have changed, so CPK it was for me. I wanted something I could grab pretty quickly since my flight was about to board, so I hopped in line for CPK. One good thing about this CPK is that they recognize that people at airports can generally be short on time, so they have pizzas ready made and boxed for you to take on your plane with you. That being said... these pizzas are grossly overpriced (I mean $17+ for a smallish personal pizza??) and clearly have just been chilling under the heat lamps in the boxes for a while.  And yes, I know... when you're dining at an airpot and you're in a hurry, what are you expecting? I generally like CPK when I go the regular, non-airport CPKs for a sit down meal, but I can't bring myself to give this CPK a stellar review. The margherita pizza that I ordered was essentially a cheese pizza with some basil on it. No tomatoes, no garlic, no additionally mozzarella cheese. Because I've eaten at regular CPKs, I KNOW they can do better. tl;dr: Beggars can't be choosers. I'd come back here again to grab a pizza to go if I was really in a rush, but be prepared to pay an arm and a leg for a pizza that's been sitting there for a while and is not up to normal CPK standards.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-19

Most of the employees working here seemed very unorganized and not well trained for each of their positions. I'm going to guess that most of them were all new hires. Once I got seated at a small table, I started things off with an iced tea. Then I ordered their Sicilian pizza. *Sicilian Pizza* I almost never ever order a pizza, but hey, it's in their name... when in Rome! It turned out to be a very tasty delicious pizza! Just the right size, however it was a bit pricey at about $19. Fortunately my waitress was pretty good. She was nice and refilled my iced tea when it was getting low.

Food: Our family ordered the bbq chicken pizza, the chicken avocado club with a side salad, and the kung pao spaghetti (without meat because adding chicken/shrimp was an extra $3).

The chicken avocado club and side salad were also decent. 4/5 Service: I think we saw our server twice the entire meal -- once when he came to take our order and once to deliver the check. Other than that, he never came by to refill our water (food and drinks were delivered by someone else), didn't even give us silverware (we had to flag down a random waiter to get our silverware), and never gave more than curt answers/never made eye contact when he did come by. 1/5",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-19

The honey glaze on the chicken dumplings gave the dish flavor, otherwise the dumplings thenselves would have been bland. My favorite appetizer is the one with the shishito peppers. I always order the shishito peppers as an appetizer at any restaurant that serves them, because I like to compare how each restaurant dresses them up.

I swore I wouldn't come again after last time, but I caved, and ended up having a worse experience than the time before. Do not come here unless you have a minimum of an hour to kill. Based on a half dozen or so visits, it always takes over 10 minutes after you're seated for somebody to come by and take your order. If you're ordering an alcoholic drink, expect another 10-20 minutes before that drink arrives. As far as your food, expect it 20-40 minutes after your order. You'll finish your first drink by then, but your server will not come by to ask if you'd like another drink. If you're lucky you can flag them down. Your food will be brought out by somebody who isn't a server, and can't take your order for a second drink.  The food is fine, drinks are good, selection is more than adequate. Service is just so awful that nothing could make up for it. When you mention the delay to your server they complain about how big their section is, a large party of people, or how busy they are. They absolutely never apologize or say anything to put you at ease. When I mentioned the 15 minute wait for my drink order this time I got the busy/large party excuse, and the waitress then the waitress pointed out another person and said they'd been waiting longer. That would be even worse than my 15 minutes, but I specifically saw that table get cleared and that exact person sit down. So it was a blatant lie, and again, no apology or anything to put me at ease. Just lies, excuses, and complaints.  Hopefully I'm never foolish enough to come back here again, but I'm at this airport in this terminal dozens of times a year, and there aren't many options. They kind of know you're stuck with them and act like you're lucky they even serve you at all. It leaves me feeling taken advantage of every time.

Yes, this place was very busy at the time I sat down...but it took about 15 minutes after I sat down before anyone even came up to take my order or greet me. I ordered my food, which again I've stated was awesome as usual, spinach-quinoa salad and margherita pizza, but then it was served to me without utensils and napkins. It took about a good five minutes before it was given to me, in which that case it was just thrown down on my table without any apology, as if I had inconvenienced them for asking for it. Cuz I guess, supposedly I'm supposed to eat my salad w my fingers and wipe my mouth with my sweater...right?? Duh silly me. During the time I ate and enjoyed my food, I never once got asked how my meal was and if there was anything else I needed...booooooo.

Ahmad J.,"San Francisco, United States",1277,675,1835,4.0,14/6/2014,"CPK is like an oasis in a Desert in the food court of LAX Terminal 1 when compared to other options available. I'm not a great fan of CPK but at-least you get fresh pizza made to order that comes to you piping hot. I got the Thai Chicken pizza ($12.89) and a naked juice smoothie ($5.25) so prices are exactly double of what you would pay outside but that is common across all spots in the food court. After ordering I was expecting a long wait as CPK seemed to be the preferred choice of most travelers which resulted in a long queue but surprisingly the wait was under 10 minutes. As expected I was not a great fan of the taste of the Thai chicken. It seemed to have some sort of bland tomato sauce masquerading as a Thai sauce which I felt sucked as it is not difficult to create a simple hot and sweet tomato based sauce that would be more representative of Thai flavor. Anyway they toss a bunch of thinly sliced carrots along with a sprinkling of sprouts to make up for the lack of Thai flavor. They do accept cards but are one of the few restaurants that do not take Amex. Of-course the server did not know this and instead loudly proclaimed that my Amex was declined so that was not pleasant (quickly fixed by providing another card). Looking at the larger picture and comparing this CPK location to other options available, I would probably still pick CPK the next time I'm flying through Terminal 1.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-19?start=60

On 1/22 my 3 friends and I went to this location (Manhatten Beach) as we have gone several times in the past. Dinner was good, everything seemed fine. When the bill came, we split the amount 4 ways, the total for us all was $35 per person (which included tax & tip) 2 paid cash while the other two of us paid with our debit. I told the waiter to charge the two cards $35 each, the rest was cash and the change was his tip (20% because he seemed nice). He did that (So at least we thought). We left the restaurant everything was fine. Come a week later when I noticed on my bank account that I was charged $40. I called my friend who also had paid with a CC and the same thing happened to her. On January 30th, she called the restaurant and the manager, Walter Hastey, sure enough found the receipt. He emailed them to her for confirmation and we found out that not only had the waiter changed the amount, he had re-printed the receipt, and signed it as well! That was an extra $10 for our order plus committed forgery by signing our names! The manager, Walter Hastey, acknowledge the error to my friend and said that ""the conversation with the waiter was going to be awkward"" What about the customer who he committed fraud too??? Isn't that more awkward?? Yes it was only $5 each, but HE REPRINTED AND SIGNED OUR NAMES!!!!  How many times has this guy done it to customers before??????? He also said he would give both my friend and I a $30 Gift Card each for what we went through. Later that morning, I called the CPK Corporate offices (310-342-5000) to let them know what was going on at their establishment in Manhatten Beach, which I had to leave a message...twice!I received NO call back so later that evening I called the same manager , Walter Hastey, of restaurant my friend had spoken to, to ask what the outcome of the waiter was. At first he was NOT apologetic at all, he sounded bothered that I had called and he acknowledged that corporate had re routed the message to him. Keep in mind, I was one of the victims and he had never spoken to me before. When I told him it felt worse that I'm calling about the situation and he sounded bothered, he then changed his voice to sound like it mattered. He also told me that he was trying to make it right by sending us the gift cards like he told my friend(which he said would be put in the mail that night). He asked for my personal info so he can send mine directly to me (which now I dread giving it to him!) Well as of now, neither one of us has received anything! I'm not even sure to be honest that the waiter has been let go. he probably just got moved to another location! All I can say CHECK YOUR STATEMENTS FOR ANY PREVIOUS DINNING EXPERIENCES HERE! And as you can see, if there is any issues with CPK, neither the management nor corporate takes it seriously! GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE GUYS! I will be happily posting this to all CPK close to the area just incase the waiter was just moved to another restaurant location to make people aware of your company's business values and not let this happen to someone else again. CPK needs to teach their management that simple follow through will always help keep unsatisfied customers coming back.

Denise C.,"Pacifica, United States",44,148,87,1.0,4/4/2012,"This place is pretty meh. I mean really meh. It's located in the middle of the food court right after the security checkpoint (Southwest and US Airways) with a ton of other things.  I had the works pizza (personal pizza size) and a Naked juice... Which came out to be about $16... Ugh. Luckily this was on company dime... Or I would've skipped lunch all together. Then again, this is typical airport pricing... So maybe it's not a big deal. The wait for food was about ten minutes (only redeeming point is that they make it ""fresh""), but the food court it's in is really gross and not cleaned very well... Would not recommend this place unless you were dying of hunger... It's the only quick place that's not absolutely stomach turning in terminal 1. The pizza dough is really gross... Like frozen... isn't really reminiscent of it's better half (a real California Pizza kitchen). I could barely make my way through the whole thing... though it was rather large for a personal pizza. The ingredients they put on the pizza weren't bad, but the dough just killed it in my opinion... then again, this is a express version of a chain restaurant...",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-19?start=100

Cooked perfectly, crust somewhere between thin and deep dish, and baked just right to be a slight bit chewey. Great-tasting sauce. And Just the right amount of cheese. Really perfect.

Maybe something you should warn people as you seat them? It's not called California Kitchen. Also no potatoes available. 15 minute wait for a server to get our order and that's when we were notified of the items they didn't have or could not make. 20 minutes later we get our food. My sandwich was missing the avocado and someone else I was with was given cold eggs and they forgot his sausage, which they did not bring out until we were done eating everything else. Had to go to the bar ourselves to get refills. Very poor management. The manager was just pacing around instead of directing his crew or speaking with guest.

Once we ordered, the drinks and food were on time and quite good. But you need utensils and napkins to enjoy them. I asked the hostess and she said ""one second"", which ended up being never. I went to the bar and the bartender scoffed at me but I managed to squeeze two sets from him before raiding the hostess stand for another (because my travel companions tore a napkin in half just to share). Our server came by and asked how everything was, but moved on with ""good"" before we could answer.
