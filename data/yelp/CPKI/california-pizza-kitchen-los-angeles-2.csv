Samantha C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,6,5.0,8/22/2015,I love this location super yummy! Staff is very helpful and food always taste fresh!  Love the Thai crunch and Santa Fe salad!

Farkhod K.,"Pasadena, CA",67,5,1,2.0,6/5/2017,"Ok, so I might not be a pizza expert, but if you want to have a real pizza that place is not for you. Pizza sizes are very small (almost a big snack) and maybe couple pieces of chicken. Thin crust ? Nahh, its extra thin with some salad and crunch on top. Thats not a pizza. So we had 2 small pizzas, beer and soda. = $50.  On a good side, pretty good staff and great cute place to relax or maybe to have a date.   P.S went to Chinese restaurant after, because we were still hungry lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2
Trin H.,"Los Angeles, CA",598,339,2184,4.0,4/18/2015,"Came here before getting my shop on at the Bev Center. Food and service was great. We had Candace as our server who was extremely attentive and helpful. We shared the smoked salmon dish (forgot the exact name) between two people, pea soup, and mushroom spinach flatbread as our appetizer.  Despite them being really busy on a Saturday afternoon, service was prompt and food came out fairly quickly, our waitress also accommodated a last minute change in our menu selection so thank you for doing that!  Food was pretty good esp the appetizer--good stop for some lunch in between shopping as there aren't that many dining options without leaving the mall.  If I wasn't on a low carb diet I would definitely get some pasta bc they look amazing. Gotta love CPK! Remember to check yelp photos before ordering bc that can help you decide what to get-- that's what we did! Haha.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2
Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",1146,1746,5588,4.0,1/17/2016,"Time to get down-to-earth a little bit so my friend brought me to this pizza place which only have locations in California (as its name properly indicated). As neither of us was starving at that point (and both of us would like to save some space for dessert), we shared a half-size BBQ chicken salad (with avocado added) and the shrimp fettuccine. They both came in large size. Felt like once in a while I just need some junk food to boost up my energy! Would like to give a try on their handcrafted pizza next time!

Jieun J.,"Koreatown, Los Angeles, CA",143,62,63,3.0,1/27/2016,"I was a little iffy about giving this place another try after getting sick from the Asian pasta.  This time, I got the garlic cream pasta, white sauce pizza & the chocolate cake with ice cream on top.   The pasta was a bit dry so it was hard to take in.  The white sauce pizza was not that good.  The choco cake was too dry so the ice cream helped, but it made the cake too soggy.   The girl who served us was awesome though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2

Our waiter was a bit eccentric - maybe he wanted to be an actor - but that didn't really bother us. We all got three half salads and tea and it hit the spot.

Pamela K.,"Culver City, CA",170,350,1270,2.0,10/12/2014,"2.5 stars. I have CPK once a year or so but always go with one of my stand by's, the BBQ chopped chicken salad. Curbside delivery at pretty much all of the CPKs make it easy to order by phone and pick up. But, my salad was just meh. It tasted a bit frozen. Not much life in it. The bread were tinier than my palm.  Order was ready when they said it would be. Portion size of the salad was the same as I remembered from the past. The quality was just so-so. Sort of disappointed. This location is connected to the Beverly Center so keep that in mind when dining in or picking up. It's busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2
Bonnie G.,"Woodland Hills, CA",132,776,676,1.0,9/24/2015,"very small cpk . Tried to order delivery to Cedars for lunch . The staff seemed incompetent was not confident that we would receive it ad first they left us on hold for over 5 minutes   & they didn't seem to grasp where we were at the hospital.  We waited till we were famished at dinner and this restaurant is NOT walking distance ""right around the corner""  we ordered two salmon dinners which were edible. The flatbread pizza was a soggy wilted mess. The avocado egg rolls were also a soggy mess. Restaurants should wrap items that are crisp or line the packaging in paper to absorb the steam as this is what caused a soggy mess of food.

Fenny C.,"Los Angeles, CA",235,59,145,5.0,3/17/2015,"This review is specifically on the service we had with Joshua. He's such a great waiter. He was very helpful and really funny.  The food here is good, they have a nice selection on wines :)  and the place is really clean. The hostess was sweet too, not sure what her name was.  It's located conveniently below the Beverly Center, you can park in the mall parking lot or on the street. After 9 or 10pm I believe they close the front entrance and you need to walk out from the back, so if you're coming for a later dinner I would suggest parking in the underground mall lot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2
Denise L.,"Santa Clara, CA",971,2329,3799,4.0,9/6/2013,"With a toddler and hot weather, CPK seemed like the best choice for a family friendly restaurant. Smallest CPK I have been to, but service was excellent. My friend and I can drink tons of diet coke, and he kept them flowing all throughout our meal. Had the chicken lettuce wraps which were delicious and they even provided us with extra lettuce when we ran out quicker than the chicken. My all time favorite pizza here is the Garlic Chicken, but they got rid of it. I asked the hostess if they had something similar, and she said no. I started perusing the menu and decided on a pizza but when I looked at the front cover, it had a sticker introducing the new and improved garlic chicken pizza. Odd that she didn't even know about it. It was slightly different but still friggin delicious. Their bread has also changed where it's not old stale slices of sourdough bread with butter on the side but hot out of the oven chunks of sourdough with the olive oil/vinegar dip. For dessert we had their famous butter cake with ice cream and the salted caramel pudding. The butter cake was AMAZING! We devoured the moist and warm butter cake (reminds me of pound cake) but with perfect crisp around the edges. The salted caramel pudding is good, but got way too much chunks of salt at the end. Main con of this restaurant is that parking at the Beverly Center is not validated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2
Eunice K.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,17,9,1.0,12/20/2015,"No star!  Worst service ever!   I went to cpk today with my bf after christmas shopping. I was so happy before I came into this restaurant. We were sited table with light was not working because That's was only one table available to sit. Table was so dark but we didn't mind. After we received our food, we noticed that there is no plates and folks. I was looked for our server but he was too far away from us and we waited but he is not coming. I was stand up and go to front and at the middle I asked one of server to provide me the plates and folks so we can eat. Ok I understand maybe my server was too busy to come to our table but, he just keep passing us by and helping other tables except us. Server was Cameron. Because of you!

Erick D.,"Mid-City, Los Angeles, CA",23,36,16,4.0,1/17/2016,Pretty good CPK. Went on a Sunday afternoon and we did not have to wait at all for a table. Our waiter Daniel was spectacular. He catered to our every need. He exchanged a pasta I did not like for another. On the negative side it is a very small location. It is a little crowded but when not packed it is fine.

YouGoGlenCoco S.,"Los Angeles, CA",89,98,108,2.0,7/11/2015,"I have been to this particular CPK a bajillion times and it's been great! However, yesterday (7/10/15), I had a horrible waitress that ruined my lunch. I'm an avid tea drinker and order it most of the time when I'm eating out. As we sat down, I ordered the hot tea. Usually, they bring a small tea pot of hot water with a small plate that has honey, couple of lemon slices, and an UNOPENED tea bag. May I know why my waitress brought a single cup of tea with a tea bag that she took upon herself to open and dunked it. By the time she got to my table, my tea was PITCH BLACK and bitter. Who does that?! How do I know it wasn't someone else's tea?! Very sanitary. Also, I had to stir my drink with a fork as no spoons were brought over. Thanks?! We had ordered the cobb pizza and the wild mushroom. I asked for thin crust on both and received only one pizza with the thin crust. The pizzas were good but I wish we got what we had ordered. I let it go because we were with a child and I didn't want to wait any longer. Lastly, once we got our check, we paid with cash and the waitress just ASSUMED it was her tip in there as well so she never brought the change back. Once again, WHO DOES THAT?! We just got up and left. I was sick of her. I don't even remember her name, that's how annoyed I was at her. CPK please train your staff.

Our server Josh was nothing but amazing! He was friendly, made jokes without being too ""weird"" or overly talkative like some servers tend to be, and was helpful with his recommendations. We ordered the Hawaiian BBQ pizza (scrumptious with the perfect amount of sauce) and the asparagus spaghettini (my favorite dish at cpk). We also ordered the strawberry lime margarita which was a little too strong for my taste but I'm just a little lightweight lol  Overalls, my experience here was great!

First it was SO COLD in the restaurant that I could barely sit there any longer than necessary. The fork had dried food stuck on it, gross.... And the hot sauce bottle was so gross with all the gooyeeee stuff on the top, it just made me wonder if the stuff I could see was this dirty what was going on with stuff I couldn't see?!?  Lastly the salmon really had a strong fishy taste to it which I've never experienced at any other CPK.

We walked in and placed our name on the waitlist for a 20-25 minute wait, and came back 20 minutes later. It seemed like some people after us had been seated already, and the host at the front really hustled to get us a booth. The waitress that served us was also very attentive, and kept refilling my soda and asking us if we needed anything. We ordered the meat lovers pizza, the lettuce wraps, and a shrimp and chicken fettuccine. I highly recommend all of them! We had to take more than half the pizza home cos there was just so much food!

Ryan M.,"Orange County, CA",909,913,3417,3.0,2/21/2011,"I haven't been dining out because of my diet, but it was Doctor's orders and a family came saving me from the deliciousness of life. I have lost already 45 pounds since January 1st and I deserved a little treat for the hard work. However, you are thinking that I got a pizza....Let's see what I got at CPK at the Beverly Center. CPK is located on the La Cienega side on the street level. Not inside the mall. The family and I walked in and this CPK seems to be very small. There were only 5-6 booths and the tables seem to be too close to each other. You literally touch the next table with your elbow without noticing. I had to hear a bunch of conversation with other couples that I felt uncomfortable listening to, especially when there is a child in my group I don't remember who our server's name was, but he was extremely helpful with the menu. The child of the family ordered right off before I opened my menu. Kid loves the Hawaiian Pizza, but didn't like the coloring book that CPK gave...lol. I think it was $5.99 for the pizza, but I am not sure since I didn't pay for the meal. Our server mentioned that they have a new menu called ""Small Cravings"" for those watching out their weight. So, I took advantage of it. I ordered the Mediterranean Plate ($4.29) and Tuscan Panzanella Salad ($5.49). The prices are estimate since it was quite low when I saw it. The Mediterranean Plate is basically hummus, pizza pita bread with a Mediterranean salad mix (Cucumbers, onions, and Greek Olives). I blame a certain friend for getting me hooked to hummus, which I have never had, but so addicted to it. The Tuscan Panzanella Salad was quite sweet, but I love the beans and the sauce which I am not familiar with, but made the salad taste good.  I don't have the total since I didn't pay, but I think I saw it was $30 something and the family had a 20% off coupon that you have to use 7 days after visit.  So, it would be around $25 and the discount would go to the tip. Service was great, but it was the crowding I had a problem with. Grand Lux Cafe has a bigger room and they probably stole a lot of real estate from them. So, did you guess what I got correctly? Probably not. You thought I would get pizza. Not for a long while. With me 45 pounds down, I still got a long way to go to 240 and time to flex my muscles once again.

Ryan H.,"Los Angeles, CA",55,324,144,4.0,8/20/2013,"haven't been to this cpk at the bev center in forever.  they did some kind of re-design, but it's looks like pretty much the same color scheme and themes as before (woods, beiges, sticky table tops and menus etc..) and made changes to the menu too.  i could swear the bread used to be much better.  little bite sized pieces of a variety of breads, not just white bread... but maybe i'm drunk and imagining this!  menu has changed too so if you're looking for your old favorites you best keep on looking.  (my fave, a pizza with shrimp, has disappeared from the menu!) service was lovely... very nice waitress from bulgaria.  looked mila kuna'ish.  food was tasty.  i just had the pizza with everything on it, the works. i definitely very much like the food here..... i just think i like the old menu better!  this is something i would like to eat every day but running about at $15+ per pop, i can't eat it every day! but when i'm hungry, wanna get fat, wanna treat myself -- this is definitely a tasty place for me. (just read another review here that is disturbing.... do they really brush high fructose corn syrup on the pizza?  before i eat here next time i will definitely ask....)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2?start=40

Luis G.,"Beverly Hills, CA",98,3,1,2.0,1/7/2016,"Usually go to the Beverly Hills location but was close by and decided to grab dinner with my girl friend . Got seated right away it was 9:24 pm got taken to the table and got handed menus and was told the server would be with me ,it was 12 minutes until the server finally came to our table (the table smelled like humid towel not like fresh sanitizer ) . We ordered 2 strawberry lemonades and got what I'm sure was fountain lemonade with strawberry syrup, what happen to the freshness?  .For dinner my gf had a pizza with olives and pineapple, and I had the original bbq chicken pizza which is one of my favorites but it was missing something that night. In my opinion CPK has gone down in customer service significantly and they need to get back on there game . Only reason I give two stars is because food was edible and the server refilled our drinks. Hope to have a better experience next time . Definitely not at this location though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2?start=40

Sam H.,"San Gabriel, CA",54,3,96,1.0,12/20/2015,We were sitted and the waiter didn't come for good 10 minutes until we finally found one and asked him to bring us our waiter. Even then it took good 5 minutes before our waiter showed up. We asked for bread and it never came. Asked again and still never came. The food took really long time to come out and just poor service generally. We waited about 30 mins for the food and when we asked I'm pretty sure they forgot our order so they brought us some chips with barely any guacamole as service for forgetting our order I suppose. We had to wait even longer for the food to come out. Service is pretty poor here. They didn't apologize once. If you're wanting to go to cpk find another location. Update: the manager finally came when we kept bugging about our food and they admitted that they forgot our order. Finally apologized and said that the drinks were on the house. FYI we waited for over 45 mins for the food to come out. You guys decide. Is 45 minutes worth the drinks? Cause I would rather pay for the drinks and get my food in 15 minutes.  I probably won't be coming back here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2?start=20

madeline d.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,12,,2.0,10/23/2015,"The food is good but if you are ordering to take out you had better check everything because they will probably get the order wrong. in the last 4 months I got 3 orders completely wrong. I ordered split pee soup but what I got was tortilla soup which was auful and went right down the drain.I ordered Penne pasta, but I got spaghetti which I have a hard time eating. I went into the store and ordered face to face so you'd think they could get the order right? Nope! I started checking every item, opening up the pizza box, etc, but that's a drag and this last time I went into the store and spoke to the order taker directly. So, buyer beware!

I went tonight and had the Thai Crunch Salad, which was great. I love the dressing they put on the salad. I admit we sat without drink refills for awhile and that was disappointing, however our server was very nice and it wasn't his fault. His other table kept him forever to ask sooo many questions. There were other employees standing around talking. So to finish off my review they should work on teamwork to improve their service.

Jamie C.,"West Hills, CA",72,422,3689,4.0,10/15/2014,"My family is a huge fan of CPK, it's kinda scary when they know everyones name in your party. Me-not so much. Still, every year I get a CPK gift card from one of my uncles and have to do something with it. The portions are huge. It had been a few years since I ate here so I forgot how much food each entree and pizza are. How bout just a slice of pie, maybe 2? Nope. Last visit we were a party of 2 and we ordered too much, there was barely enough room for the food and plates to sit on our two top.  2 HUGE flat bread pizzas...gorge! Pear and Gorgonzola  - I liked this pie, it's different-it's like salad meets pie. Caramelized pears add a little bit of sweetness, gorgonzola cheese was crumbly and has a salty bite and walnuts were a nice crunchy surprise! Spinach and Artichoke   pie is a nice concept, but gets soggy, fast.  Ingredients are not skimpy by any means, there was plenty on both pies.  Peach lemonade   was tasty, but just a tad heavy on the syrup for my taste. After a few sips I gave up on it and went for a cold brew, goes better with pie anyway. Our server was so nice, upbeat and suggested items on menu. We had a nice dining experience, resturant was tidey, but Im not hooked on their food, I'm just not a CPK fan. Delivery is available and this CPK delivers by bike. In the heart of Beverly Grove pedaling is faster, most of the time, than driving and looking for parking. Update: Had to change my original 3 stars to a 4 star because service was stellar, prices are more than fair considering portions, hot food hot and cold beer cold!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2?start=20
Kun K.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,34,73,3.0,1/23/2016,"So, I have mix feeling about this place. First of, we got there early when it wasn't busy. Our server is really attentive and he does come in and check up on us from  time to time. We order the Jambalaya Pasta and the Hawaiian Pizza (thin crust). The pizza is delicious, the outside bread is crispy and the inside is chewy. The ham is thick and the sweet pineapple made a perfect touch on that pizza. Right away, I felt in love with the dish. However, the Jambalaya pasta is a different story. The noodle is under-cook and still hard to chew. I'm 35 years old and my mouth was getting tire from chewing. I don't know if any of you have ever put so much chili on a dish that it no longer taste spicy but you get that strong bitter taste instead? Well, this is what happen with the pasta, the cook put extremely a lot of spices that made it taste so bitter. Took the pasta home and after putting all the effort of re-cooking that dish, it still has that strong spice flavor that it won't go away. I ended up trowing that dish to the trash. What a waste of money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2?start=20

Christophe F.,"Toronto, Canada",215,90,458,4.0,10/18/2013,"This was my first restaurant stop on my visit to LA and chose it to be the last one prior to heading back home. In a little over five days I visited the location three times and overall I'm very happy with the experiences. I had a few different dishes throughout the visits and each was equally good, with the least favourite being the hand tossed pizza (the breaded chicken with arugula takes the top spot for me, followed by the crunchy thin crust marguerita pizza).  Desserts were also good and decent sized. What made this place stand out though was the great service provided by the waiters and the hosts. Not only were they very efficient but they also seemed to have a genuine interest in my satisfaction (either that or they'll be really good actors one day!). :D I'll definitely come back to visit in future trips.

Stephanie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",167,53,7,3.0,2/17/2014,"Out of all of the CPK's I have been to, this one has by far the best service. The staff here is very patient, friendly and attentive even though they seem to be busy all the time. They are located in the Beverly Center building so the few times that I have been here, they don't ever seem to have a down time. However, there are always a couple of tables open and with just a party of 2, it is very easy to be seated quickly. It is also a convenient location so that after eating a filling lunch/dinner, you can walk it off at the Beverly Center or at the plaza across the street.  The food here is the same as at any other CPK. Some dishes are pretty good and some are okay. I used to like the sandwiches here, but ever since they changed the bread to ciabatta bread, which isn't really my favorite kind of bread, it no longer tastes the same. However, their tortilla soup is delicious! It's a bit sweet and tasty. My boyfriend really likes their four cheese ravioli which is tasty as well and comes with your choice of mushrooms. The only downside is that it takes a longer while for your entrees to come out. When you are starving, you don't want to wait more than 10 minutes for your food. Other than that, my experiences here has always been pleasant and satisfactory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2?start=20

In trying to make up for the terrible experience they gave us a coupon for a free entree. So yesterday I went back in with my wife and son. I told them I had a coupon and the manager came over and said I'm sorry you had a bad experience last time we will take great care of you today.  Well that was a huge lie.  We asked for bread 3 times!! It took nearly 15 minutes to get that. They brought out food for my wife and I , however it took 7-10 more minutes before they brought out my sons pizza.

We recently got to try this specific CPK for the first time, and it was a pretty good experience.  It can be a bit of a challenge to find as it is tucked into the bottom floor of the maze known as the Beverly Center.  It is also quite small, but still had everything that we have come to expect from CPK.  The service was good too, but they did seem a bit under staffed.  I order the Thai Chicken Pizza, which is my favorite CPK pizza.  It tasted exactly the same as it does at all of the other CPKs, and I love knowing exactly what I am going to get when ordering something because of CPK's consistency.  My pizza was delicious as usual and exactly what I would expect from CPK.

We walked in TEN minutes before closing but they still took us.  We sat down in a booth and browsed the menu.  A server came by saying that our supposed server was at the moment MIA, so she took our drink orders. She came back a few minutes later, saying that our supposed waitress was still MIA and that she was going to just serve us.  I like that initiative in someone.  She was cute too.  No, I did not ask her for her number. I decided to get the meat lover's pizza (forget exactly what it was called) and a small Thai crunch salad.  The pizza wasn't too bad.  It had pepperoni, salami, Canadian bacon, and Italian sausage on it.  I actually really like the Thai crunch salad.  I get it almost every time.  There's probably as much ""stuff"" in there, if not more, than there is actual lettuce, but I still like it.  It's got chicken, crispy rice noodles, peanuts, edamame, carrots, red cabbage, green onions, crispy wonton strips, and uh... yeah, it's a lot of stuff.  You can also add avocado for an additional charge.  It's not healthy by any means I'm sure, but I like it.

Ryan A.,"Los Angeles, CA",105,148,54,2.0,9/5/2010,"I mean ... I hear all the rave about California Pizza Kitchen it's even referred to by acronym (C.P.K.) but, it just didn't live up to the hype.  Before finally trying out the restaurant, I used to buy the frozen version of their pizza which I thought was quite decent.  The frozen version is definitely thinner, which, surprisingly is not as thin dining in.  Kinda confusing.   Appetizer/Starter - So, I wasn't trying to each much so I ordered the ""chicken quesadilla"".  I commend them for finding the worlds smallest tortilla to use on a quesadilla.  Unbelievable, I mean, I get it, it's $4.99 they cut it into 4 equal pieces, but the portion is so small each piece is bite size.  Eh, I mean it tasted semi decent, but for $4.99 NOT worth it.   Pizza - My homie ordered the BBQ chicken pizza.  I tried a slice, it was OK. Not worth the $13 you spend on a personal size pizza.  Ridiculous. Whole foods pizza is better. Service - It wasn't great, but what can I expect in 2010???  In my opinion, servers nowadays seem to just ""EXPECT"" a tip without attempts at earning it.  I can't blame them though, it's also the patrons who just ""automatically"" tip (no matter if the service was amazing or terrible) who enable servers to behave this way. Oh well.  I drink lots of water.  Our waiter picked up my plate after I finished my bite size quesadilla.  My empty glass was just sitting there, on the table as he picked up my empty plate.  5-10 minutes later, my glass still sat there, all by it's lonesome, crying helplessly to be re-filled.  What did my glass do to deserve this??   In conclusion, I'm sticking to the frozen version of their pizza and not have to feel like an a$$hole because I don't tip the server because I feel they didn't deserve it. Side note for all you half a$$ed servers... TIP IS OPTIONAL. Know what it means as well ""To Insure Proper Service""  comply and you shall be rewarded.

I reminded her 15 min. later she said ""sure"" as if she is hearing the request for the first time. The Kung Pao Spaghetti was lacking in chicken pieces; usually there is a good amount, this is the first time there were only bits and pieces. I didn't complain because service was bad enough and just wanted to eat and get out. While eating another lady sat by herself and was waiting and waiting and waiting for her server, she sat at the table next to ours. She looked around and gave this exasperated look. I spoke to her and said we are having a bad experience too, waited 10 min to be acknowledged, and I am not leaving a tip. The lady said she already wasted 15 min of he lunch, she got up and walked out and told the hostess at the front what happened. On my way out I also told the hostess our serve Katie was horrible. Horrible horrible service from our server and the food was sub par, horrible all around CPK. I do not think I will ever go back to this CPK location. This location will end up out of business if you continue in this manner, no managers to be seen and no acknowledgment by staff and the food was sub par compared to other locations. Get your act together CPK beverly center! It's not difficult to provide good friendly service by people who want to be there and good food by following CPK standard menu preparation procedures.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2?start=60
Farnaz S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",182,57,18,5.0,6/22/2014,The place used to be too noisy but this time was  very nice. The waitress was attentive and quinoa salad was very yummy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2?start=60
Juliana C.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,193,209,5.0,2/7/2014,Pretty consistent chain.  Food always taste the same across the board.  I love the mushroom pizza.  The service here is wonderful and you can go shopping right after so that's awesome :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2?start=60
Jabari M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,1,1.0,3/19/2014,Worst CPK ever in the city of Los Angeles. Waiter kept bringing the wrong food and kept insisting I was wrong and she heard something else -__- don't tell me what I said. Took 45 mins just bring a salad. I mean what you got to do? Grow the lettuce first ? And the some the staff members had attitude. Not my fault you work there. Don't like it. Quit.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2?start=60
Milton H.,"Washington, DC",616,126,520,4.0,7/15/2012,CPK is not exactly the most trendy LA restaurant but the menu has really been upgraded. I had a sufficiently filling caramelized peaches and chicken salad with a light vinaigrette dressing. Really really good. My wife got the spinach and artichoke pizza....crust was nice and thin and very tasty. My teen got the Kung Pao spaghetti with shrimp and loved every noodle of it. My oldest teen got the classic BBQ chicken pizza. I removed the cheese and nibbled on it and as with my last CPK visit it was exceptionally good. The service was great---my tweens thoug the server was a movie star because of his eye color (whatever)...but everybody in LA looks like this don't they?? Would definitely good back if no other quality food places were in the area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2?start=60
Leeor S.,"Beverly Grove, Los Angeles, CA",220,18,16,3.0,3/28/2014,Foods great like every cpk... Staff is so rude and impatient though at this specific location. Step it up... This ain't a fast food joint.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2?start=60
Dean H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,6,,2.0,8/9/2015,"The only reason it's gets 2 stars is because the food was good. The service, on the other hand, was atrocious. Our appetizer plate along with the bread plate were still on the table when we finished our main course. The server visits were few and far in between. Will definitely never go back. Should have stuck with the Beverly Hills branch, where we normally go. That one offers much better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2?start=60
Cath C.,"Mid-City West, Los Angeles, CA",9,168,2,1.0,3/24/2014,"Horrible experience!! If I could give minus rating, I woudl give -5 stars. First, I received ice water in broken glass. When I asked for replacement, the wait staff did not believe me that glass was broken. He gave me attitude. Then, he never came back to take our order. When finally he did, we never received our food. I saw other tables getting their food which they came after us. Another service staff (much nicer guy) came to tell us that ""computer crashed"" therefore they needed to take our order again. How come computer crash deleted our order ONLY and no other tables?? After waiting for SOOOOO long, we got our burned pizza and salad. We were so hungry that we did not ask for unburn pizza. We just removed burn part and started to eat. When I was having second slice of pizza, I saw hair.... OH NO!!!.  We wanted to the manager to complain, but we realized that if the restaurant runs this way, what we should expect from manager. My boyfriend asked for check and left that restaurant to go to next door. The wait staff asked us if we wanted box for our pizza, we just said no thank you. I cannot believe how big chain restaurant can fall under average quality service and food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2?start=60
B O.,"Gunnison, CO",46,25,16,4.0,6/9/2014,"Our server, Eddie, was really nice and attentive. The food was great and the restaurant was clean. Big open windows and a nice, upbeat, open atmosphere.

Sam Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",1193,964,194,5.0,1/21/2008,"mlk day part 1: this is a 3 part story. i am still groggy like a bear out of hibernation. my throat is dry and all i got to drink is pepsi. i had weird drunk dreams as well. it started here at cpk of all places. my friend had a 100 dollar gift certificate to cpk. so this is how meatheads like us plan. we were gonna go to cpk and get drunk with that money then go out on the cheap. which didn't really work out. cpk had no hard liquor and trying to get drunk on been on a limited time was rough but we got a good buzz going. i've been to other cpks that had hard liquor though. our service was really good. maybe its cuz our server was from hawaii so he's just real chill. the pizza, we got the works and the sicilian and also humous. all very good.  this reminded me when i was real young and someone body would get their hands on a 20 dollar bill and we  would all get a crap load of chicken nuggets and split it. thats how we were doing it this night.  next up the club area!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2?start=120
Carrie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",98,107,,2.0,3/22/2006,"It's not the world's greatest pizza in the world, but for the variety they offer and for the other items on the menu, it'll do when everyone needs to be appeased.  The desserts are good.  The best part is that you can find one almost anywhere in L.A. now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2?start=120
Jessica S.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,208,,1.0,9/29/2005,Yuck.  I liked this place when I was young and thank god my taste buds have matured.  Nothing truly seems fresh and last time I ordered a salad my stomach immediately started hurting and I got food poisoning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2?start=120
Tals O.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,6,,4.0,4/5/2011,I love CPK. The environment is kid-friendly and their kids menus are really fun to draw. I like to order a  half chopped salad with no scallions or garbanzo beans. I also get a small barbeque chicken pizza. The salad is delicious and so is the pizza. Personally the BBQ chicken pizza is the best pizza on the menu. I recommend this fun and delicious restaurant!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2?start=120

Rebecca O.,"San Diego, CA",7,65,,4.0,6/1/2008,"Wonderful service. I think when one receives excellent service the food tends to taste better or perhaps it was the fact that we drank so much wine. Maybe it was the wine, which was fantastic, Shiraz my friends this is the way to go. I'm giving it 4 stars not because of the food but because of the location. I'm not going to write so much about the food because since this is chain, the items and taste of the food on the menu are the same in each location.This CPK is located on the first floor of the Beverly Center. You can do what we did with my friends, drink some wine or beer, pick your poison ,and then head over to the shops in the Beverly Center. Shopping and people watching becomes a lot more fun @ the Beverly Center. Once your done with your shopping and your buzz has died down, just head down La Cienega to this little bar to continue the fun. The bar is about three shops down from the coffee bean. Drinks are cheap and the crowd is laid back. Parking at CPK is located inside the Beverly Centers structure, if you plan to spend more then two hours in the area expect to pay between $4-$5. Try the carne asada pizza and the chocolate souffle. Happy eating and drinking:)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2?start=120
Catherine K.,"Los Angeles, CA",167,297,,4.0,10/27/2006,"The food is decent and predictable, but the service at this one is always good.  Everyone is friendly everytime I've been there.  Makes eating at a pretty okay chain restaurant worthwhile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2?start=120
Carmel B.,"Vancouver, Canada",1,53,,2.0,5/11/2008,"I've never worked in a restaurant but it seems like there are a few basic rules all restaurants should follow. 1. Put a friendly human in the host/hostess position and have them greet customers when they come in. 2. Don't tell customers there is a 10 minute wait when they can clearly see many empty tables. 3. Send a waiter to the table once customers are seated and take their order within a reasonable amount of time. 4. Clear empty tables. 5. Don't give food away. Guess which of the above we experienced? If you guessed all five, you are correct. I think the manager had his head up his ass. Due to the crap service, EVERYONE was getting some part of their meal comped. At the end of the meal they had the nerve to give us playing pieces to some promotional game - the catch being you could only play if you came back. Ah, yah. Good luck on that one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2?start=120
Steve R.,"Hollywood, CA",67,212,24,3.0,1/25/2009,"Having not have dined at CPK in over 4 years, I was surprised to see the size of this place. This is the smallest cpk that I have been to. I also was reminded of why I haven't been back to this place. Not to say ti's a bad restaurant, because it isn't, but when it comes to pizza and italian food, there's tons of other places in the city to go to. I love nothing better than going to a hole in the wall to get my regular greasy pepperoni and mushroom pizza, served by some greasy, sweaty, unshaven, sweat stains soaking through his white shirt with his belly sticking out a foot in front of the rest of his body, guy named sal. But if you must go to a restaurant that is also a stand up place, I guess CPK is good. It's also good if you desire a pizza that is not something you see every day such as the Buffalo Chicken Pizza (at the time I wanted a pizza and buffalo wings, so I took out two birds with one stone). Don't expect it to be high end though, this place does lettuce wraps with iceberg lettuce... tsk tsk tsk.... the rule is red leafed, romaine or higher. I don't eat what I used to feed to my rabbits, or else I'd be munching on newspapers and green pellets right now. What can I say, this place has no soul, no personality, things that are pertinent to establishing a restaurant that emerges from a crowd of similars, imposters... And please guys, don't take your girlfriend here, it's just not classy to take someone on a date to a place with the word ""pizza"" in it, I mean why not take them to pizza hut then??",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2?start=120
s t.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,6,,1.0,8/15/2009,"There were tons of flies flying around near the food to the point that it wasn't even possible to eat. I had to stop eating . The manager didn't  seem to care and acted like it wasn't a big deal. He ignored the issue and sarcastically offered a food replacement instead. I don't know but i think it' kind of a big deal when there's a fly outbreak around your food in a cpk restaurant. Yes, first time at cpk that i've been to that had tons of flies....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2?start=120
