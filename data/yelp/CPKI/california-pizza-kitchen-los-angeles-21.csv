Jon H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",30,30,286,3.0,11/30/2017,"In a rush and wish to eat in? This is not the place. One must have more than an hour to enjoy a sit down and calmly wait for drinks and food. Additionally, the cost will be higher than regular CPK's outside the airport. Pricier leases, multiple shifts to cover lag times, and security clearances all add to the surcharge of up to approximately 18% more.  With that mouthful all said and done, let's get down to the nitty-gritty of this CPK.  It is always hectic here. Located in the Terminal 1 Southwest ( under construction of course) (( is there any place at LAX not under construction? )) plenty of planes are always on take-off or landing with people hustling and bustling thru. Getting a table may take some doing at peak hours. The good thing is people are in a hurry to eat and leave. Our wait time was 15-20 minutes for a table. My publicist/agent/manager said, ok. Plus, he said I could pay from his next commission. (Last one was 9 years ago) Considering we had 2 hours to kill, it was of no consequence. Noticed the Menu is not as extensive as a regular CPK but some old favorites were there,,,,like Stella Draft Beer. 2 beers, a Margherita pizza,and a Cobb salad later, we were pleasantly happy (happier).  Unable to go wrong with what we ordered, tasted just like it should, was out pretty quick, and so we made our dash in under 2 hours. Altogether uneventful, but sometimes, thats a blessing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-21
Megan I.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,7,,1.0,12/8/2017,"Over priced for their regular menu, $19 for a pizza. We were willing to just pay it since one pizza would be enough for two people to split (you would think) but when the pizza came out it was barely bigger than my hand. What the heck.  How does it cost more than the regular cpk and come out half the size?!!!! Also, why are there so many people working?! We counted 16 people not including who's working in the kitchen. This place is so small and it was already congested and workers are squeezing their way around and just hanging out texting. We were told to go sit at the bar by the hostess  and when we went over there there were 3 workers bored just sitting in the seats. It wasn't until the bartender saw we were confused of where to go until he told them to move. Don't come here unless you love throwing away your money for small portion sizes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-21
Carmen B.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",11,42,22,2.0,11/24/2017,"Early in the morning you get excited to see there is more than breakfast places that are open. So as I walked with joy to the open CPK, I followed directions to ""please wait to be seated"" as I stand there longer than 5 min, with open tables in front of me..... I wonder why no one is helping me. There was a bartender staring at me, maybe since we caught each others eye, he would warn someone. And yet I stand there waiting..... Once my partner decided to ask what to do, they sit us down facing the entrance that I had been standing at for 7min....  I ordered quickly, and food was revived in a timely manor, and consistent with CPK.... but I can't shake the feeling the staff is lazy under the hand of Todd the manager... I know his name because when I asked the waitress and runner why three patrons walked away because no one helped them. She said her manager was right here... I looked in the direction and he is keke'ing with the bar.... Honestly, I'm disturbed. And disappointed in their work ethic",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-21

Got confused when we first got there.Got seated right away and the service wasn't bad, I remembered it being fairly slow but not horrible.  I had my standards at ""airport food"" level but it tasted pretty good. Ordered the mushroom pepperoni sausage pizza and I never realized how bomb their spinach-artichoke dip is!!! MUST. HAVE.

Phung V.,"Garden Grove, CA",267,107,199,2.0,12/6/2017,"We couldn't use our priority pass in terminal one so we had to pay for food. Not a lot of food options In terminal one, gate 16. We decided to go to CPK. I can see why this place only got 2 stars on Yelp. Why do restaurants at airports have such a bad wrap? How come the service and the food can't be the same like the real restaurants? Anyways, I ordered the pea soup and asked if it comes with crackers or bread. The server said no but she'd get me cracker anyways. So, the soup comes and guess what? No crackers. At least the soup was warm and decent. Boyfriend ordered a cheese pizza which took 30 mins. He says it taste just like the CPK frozen pizza you get at the grocery store.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-21
Jennifer B.,"Los Angeles, CA",97,658,3821,3.0,10/11/2017,"YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2017 - PART 3: 86/100 I never mind being at the airport a couple of hours early. This gives me the chance to just hangout a bit before getting on a plane.  Not a fan of Rock and Brews (aka I hate that plac - see reviews if curious enough) and I've tried Reilly's (it was okay) so next in line was CPK.  I told the host I didn't need to be seated at a table and that I was more interested in sitting at the bar. She welcomed me in and confirmed open seating in that area.  Can't go wrong with beer (it was the weekend, after all) and something else to munch on. I saw all of their listed apps come out of the kitchen and they all looked really good. But, eh, I wanted to keep it simple, so I went for the guac+chips, which, by the way, looked mighty interesting - it had a lot of fillers per its description.  Now, I'm not really a fan of corn or cilantro, and yes, I am aware that both were included. I didn't really want to knock it until I tried it. Bowl got delivered and first thing I noticed was the whole thing was bombarded with corn. There was nothing ""guac"" about its appearance, for real.  But! I did ask for it, so I had to have at least a taste.  It was surprisingly very guacamole-y! The flavor of the avocado overpowered everything else on that bowl - including the taste of corn and cilantro. The crisp of the apple was a nice touch. I'll admit - I liked it.  And it was a lot, so I didn't finish it.  Service was mediocre. Nothing to be too excited about.  Average at best. I'd probably stop by again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-21
Jennifer G.,"Sylmar, CA",352,236,1383,1.0,11/16/2017,"Aside from the hiked up prices, which is expected because it's the airport, the service here was HORRIBLE. We waited a few min in line to place a quick to-go order at the register.  We ordered two soups and a pizza. They have the pizzas ready to go in a heated area, so we got that right away but the soups, which we thought would have taken two seconds took 15 - 20 MINUTES TO GET. Our cashier said she would be right back with our soups, she then came back to tell us that she had to call a manager because the soup was too hot for her to pour.  5 min later ... no manager. She spots him walking around and starts to scream his name loudly over and over. He sees her and then walks around to the back. We thought he was going to get us our soup, but we never saw him again. She then tells us she had to call another manager and then begins to badmouth them all calling them stupid and how it takes 3 people to do a simple task here. I can't stand when employees bad mouth other coworkers to customers. It just irks me, and shows what kind of person you are. You all work there, you're all in it together, you all represent the company so help fix it.  While were standing off to the side, she proceeds to ring up other people, which she has to do to keep the line flowing, but then it became very easy for her to forget we were waiting. Another 5 min later, I see a different manager in the kitchen now screaming her name and she shouts back at him to pour the soups!! It took this dude another 5 min to do that and then walks them over to the register and places them by her on the counter. They were unreachable to us, and she was helping another customer so we had to wait for her to be done with that person. She then leaves to get that persons order and leaves our soup there. Why didn't the manager say ""Who was waiting for soup?"" And hand them to us? No he was just as careless and incompetent. At this point I was livid. My friend squeezes through the line and reaches over the counter to grab our soups which were poured in coffee cups and lids. Not very appealing. The soups were not even three quarters of the way full. No one noticed we reached for them and took them on our own. RIDICULOUS. This is an airport, people are on a time crunch. Get it together CPK. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-21

It was a decent portion and quite delicious, although under seasoned. I had to add salt and pepper and even then I think it could have had some more spices, or even just cheese! Service was fine and it was exactly how I expected it to be. Other Yelpers have complained about the price but that's to be expected with any and all airport food, isn't it?

Shanna S.,"Chattanooga, TN",120,83,269,1.0,7/17/2017,Such an unpleasant experience that we left while waiting for our food. Eye rolls when asked to be seated near a television. Eye rolls when ordered water. Eye rolls when asked for another moment to look at the menu.  And then a 15+ minute wait for a turkey sandwich. To be honest we don't know how much longer it would have taken because we had to leave to queue for our flight. Airport food services are usually known for expeditious service due to guests having to come and go. This CPK couldn't be arsed in the least.

Mercedes C.,"Mountain View, CA",568,163,51,1.0,5/30/2017,Let me start by saying this is one of the most unpleasant airport dining visits I have ever had.  I was highly disappointed with the lack of customer service.  Establishment: clean located right in the middle of the southwest terminals. Very central location.  Service: the service was beyond a negative rating the 1 star here was for pizza. ( I would give the cooks a raise)  Our service was very rude. I asked for a coke she gave me diet and when I asked for a regular she didn't apologize she got sassy and said oh is this a diet? As if I was lying. 15 minutes we got our pizza... she didn't bother to bring us plates for the first ten minutes so we had to use our napkins and then we had to ask another server for plates because our server was to busy to bring them to us. ( see pictures)  If you are having a bad day or just have a bad attitude please stay away from the customer service and food industry. It would have been nice to be greeted by a friendly face and not have to eat like animals at our table without plates/utensils and napkins.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-21
Julie R.,"Baldwin Park, CA",184,190,137,2.0,9/22/2017,"Stopped for a quick bite while we waited for our flight - I wanted something quick so I went with their caprese wrap, which was pretty much flavorless if you did not add the sauce.  My boyfriend and his family ordered their CPK classic breakfast sandwich, the lady didn't tell us that they were out of their chicken sausage pattys so the sandwich literally just had bacon, egg and cheese. Figured it'd be a little cheaper but it was the same cost at $13-14.  Best part about this place was one of the bartenders - we didn't catch his name but he made our (short) stay at the restaurant fairly enjoyable. Aside from that, I would not order breakfast here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-21

They were jam packed, and we waited about 20 minutes for a table, which we ended up having to share with another guest.  There aren't enough servers, so things didn't speed up much once seated.  We ordered pizza and drinks quickly, but they took about 25 minutes to come out. The food was good, that's why I'm giving 3 stars, but otherwise I wouldn't have recommended this CPK.  Keep in mind prices are quite high as well, up to $20 for a small single pizza.  Seeing as they were jam packed, I don't expect prices will change or service will speed up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-21

They do have a Original New York Seltzer vending machine. ;) Morning flights are always tough food options. CPK has struggled for years with breakfast, as I have tried and tried. Because I travel this terminal often I have seen real changes. They had serious staff issues as limited servers and busboys. Most recently managers and bartenders have stepped up and food waits have decreased. My favorite breakfast time is the Beverly Hills breakfast sandwich with potatoes a good value for the airport. But the bun steals the show!! The bun had been soft and fresh and delicious again and again.  I would not say it otherwise. Hot and good.

Sonj H.,"Santa Monica, CA",460,871,360,4.0,7/30/2017,"I am going to come to a highly unpopular positive opinion of this CPK- solely because of the efforts of a single employee- Alex. We rolled in a 9 Pm hungry and about to pick up our kiddo. Man was hangry, I was picky. Alex let me taste the soup, offered suggestions and was generally very warm and gracious in demeanor. We ordered food and sat down with our beers. Then checked our phones ... omg the flight was landing way early!! Alex was so sweet- he put our beers in the fridge and kept our food warm and ordered more- 30 minutes we came back when they were closing and they gave us the sweetest service, warm food- we settled up but they gave us no push to go. It was just so genuinely nice. The cheese and pepperoni pizzas were good. Massively overpriced!!! The mushroom pizza was dry and lacked sauce and cheese. I would not reorder.

Rachel D.,"Glendale, AZ",4,57,158,4.0,7/19/2017,"This was my first time flying out of the LAX airport, and I'd say CPK is one of the top food options since there really aren't many others - especially ones you can just get to-go. Overall I was really impressed!  I got the BBQ salad, and it was very reasonably priced and huge. Really tasty too, although more chicken would have been nice.

We arrived at about 7:45 and put my name on the list and was seated about 5-7 minutes later.  I know we were cutting it close, but we were being hopeful that our meal would be quick since it is the airport and everyone is more than likely in a hurry so the restaurants would do their best to speed things up, which they did.  Thank goodness! We sat down and I ordered a virgin citrus crusher, which was brought to me pretty quickly. We each ordered a pizza.  Owen and I somehow managed to order the Sicilian, which I told him that he should've ordered something different since he could have half of mine.  Joshua ordered the mushroom pepperoni sausage pizza, I think... The food came out about 10-15 minutes later.  My pizza was actually better than I expected, thank goodness Owen ordered his own because Joshua took a slice of mine already.  Joshua seemed to enjoy his pizza as well. My only complaint is that my drink was terrible.  I understand that it's a virgin, but I didn't ask for watered down lemonade w/orange juice.  It was $7 for goodness sakes.  At least, make it drinkable.  I could've asked for a glass of ice water, a few slices of lemon and orange with a few crushed mint leaves and make my own for free.  Sheesh!

And not in a good way- if my only choice is to sit at the bar because there are no available seats elsewhere and the hostess tells me I can sit at the bar. I'm going to sit at the bar even if I don't feel like a drink.  I sat down and she asked what I wanted to drink and I told her ice water- the vibe was obvious that she was annoyed. Sorry, don't feel like drinking , just hungry. I'd be at home eating somewhere else or at a normal CPK with normal prices if my flight didn't get delayed two hours. But, it is what it is. Don't throw the straw at me as you put my water down. I was so turned off that I told her I'd like my pizza togo. She told a guest next to me to move his bag cus there are plenty of people wanting to sit which is fine, if it didn't sound like she was scolding him. This is true however, it's obvious your trying to turn and burn your seats so you get quantity instead of quality tips. So within that hour of you pushing guests out, giving checks to some that weren't ready to check out, and pretty much flat out ignored me until you saw me staring at you and then my pizza that was getting cold in the window- you probably made 30 bucks? But I bet if you'd smile and slow down a second - not making it obvious that customers that don't drink or don't order enough are a nuisance to you - you could've made more. I'm a good tipper and when I say this, I say it proudly cus I've done the service industry before- I know how customers can be and blah blah.
