Lucia C.,"Los Angeles, CA",634,353,878,4.0,12/30/2017,"I've been to CPK a couple of times recently and have been very impressed by their menu! They've made some pretty noticeable improvements and the food options now go beyond pizza, pasta and salad to include more varied and healthier. My recent favorite is the Banh Mi. The drinks are good, as always. And the pizzas and salads are still delicious. The first time I visited this location at the Century City mall, it was the middle of the afternoon and the restaurant was quiet. The last visit was during lunch time, right at the peak of the busiest time. But service was excellent. We were seated promptly and got all of our food quickly. Very happy in that respect. I'm giving CPK 4 out of 5 stars because they could improve the ambiance a little bit, so it feels less like a chain restaurant. But, regardless, I'm a pretty happy customer!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-22
Sogol B.,"Los Angeles, CA",88,18,3,4.0,12/17/2017,Great family friendly place. Bbq chicken and california club pizza is amazing. The thai salad is good too if u like something light and spicy.  Try the moscow mules Very convenient place. Nice atmosphere and clean. Staff is a bit low. We had server mix ups.

Bailey K.,"Los Angeles, CA",499,80,267,2.0,12/4/2017,"This is your standard run-of-the-mill CPK location with below average service.  We came here for a ""quick"" dinner before a movie on a Saturday night. It was clear that the place was totally understaffed because one-third of the tables were empty/had dishes left from the previous diners but our wait time was still 30 minutes. We were fine with that and just explored the mall for a bit.  When we were seated it took us about 10 minutes to get a server to take our order (mushroom pizza, cauliflower wings & mac n cheese bites). When the cauliflower wings came out, they were missing the cheese crumbles so we sent it back and it took 15 minutes from that point to get them back again.  We also did not have silverware and after waiting another 5 minutes on that, just took it from an empty booth a few seats over.  The food is decent but the overall dining experience of an undertrained/understaffed restaurant is pretty disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-22
Bindi P.,"Los Angeles, CA",176,218,463,4.0,10/6/2017,"First time at this location and really enjoyed it. Located in the century city mall, it wasn't too busy when we went for dinner on a Saturday night. We waited for about 5 min.   The tostada pizza is usually my go to at cpk, but I decided to try the spinach and artichoke pizza because it sounded fantastic.  And, it was! I also got the spicy buffalo caulifower which I'm obsessed with. I seriously need to learn to make this at home, but until then I'll keep devouring it at cpk. For dessert, we got the chocolate souffle which was rich and decadent. Couldn't eat all of it even though I wanted to. Really delicious with ice cream.   Service was good and ambiance is nice and low key.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-22
Latinfoodie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,43,1,1.0,12/4/2017,Food at CPK has never been an issue. The service at this location is another story. As I am writing I am still waiting for the bread and I am 90 percent done with the food. Other tables received bread right away so why not mine. The waiter realized his mess up and instead of owning it he gave outlandish excuses questioning my intelligence. I told him to fetch the bill. The manager came over to apologize but offered excuses. I called her out and that's when she saw me writing the review. She did the right thing and gave me a free meal. To add my boss was given the wrong salad.

Setareh E.,"Los Angeles, CA",232,122,189,4.0,5/9/2017,"Had such a great experience here. Loved the food, ambiance and decor. They did a great job with everything.  We stopped by here for lunch with my husband and our baby. They were vey accomodating for our baby. I was really craving pizza so they suggested the roasted veggie pizza with goat cheese on top and we got that. We also ordered the roasted veggie salad. Everything was great and finger licking good! The only down part was when we were inhaling our salad, we found a small strand of hair in it. We brought it to their attention, they immediately apologized and took off the salad from the menu. They also offered dessert which we ordered the butter cake. It was really good and a big portion. Overall, regardless of the hair incident we still had a great experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-22

Owen H.,"Los Angeles, CA",363,163,406,4.0,4/5/2017,"Let me start off by saying that the BBQ Chicken Pizza here is better than anywhere else. I could live off of that stuff! As a child, and as an adult now. Still in love with that pizza. The other pizzas here aren't bad either. You really can't go wrong with any of the pizzas here. They have other meals here too if you aren't a big pizza fan. This place has a great kids menu with a lot for the kids to choose and a lot of different pastas and salads. The food here is pretty cheap as well. I recommend coming here if you have a big group. It is cheap, fun, and the food is good.

Angel L.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,120,,1.0,11/13/2017,"Bad management and clear health code violations.   We had some time to kill before a movie so we decided to wait for a table this past Saturday evening.  Though there were a few empty tables, we were quoted a 50 minute wait.  Fine.  Over 50 minutes pass, and we go back and check.  Were told another 10-15 minutes.   We were finally seated in a booth near the window and open kitchen.  Directly across from us was a large family, who had their medium-sized dog under the table.  I love animals and own dogs but hello? There is no outdoor seating area, this is inside the restaurant, and that dog was CLEARLY NOT a service animal.  There was no vest, and the owners were playing with it, putting it on their laps and taking pictures with it.  There was a big puddle of water and other gross stuff under that table from either the family or the dog.  We asked our server (who was very nice) whether the restaurant permitted this and she said yes.  Yes?  This is clearly against the health code.  Either she doesn't know the law or didn't want to make a fuss.  Probably the latter, which I understand, but management should know better. As we were waiting for our food, my friend who was sitting across from me and facing the kitchen, pointed out that the cooks on the line were eating the food.  I turned around and saw it.  And they were not wearing any gloves.  Ewwww.  Come on now, wtf.

Whitney S.,"Los Angeles, CA",165,197,423,4.0,7/27/2017,I really like this new location! We shared the Italian chopped salad (I like how they don't over do it on the dressing) and BBQ pizza and margarita pizza.

They even got us in for dinner on a Friday night with a reservation and since it was our first time the manager greeted us with their delish guac and chips.

I found it was the small things that quickly added up, I ordered Ice Tea and then asked for sweet and low - I had to ask for it twice.   The pizza was delivered to our table and we asked for crushed red pepper and Parmesan cheese.  The crushed red pepper was never delivered and we had to ask two more times for the grated Parmesan which finally arrived half way through the meal.  I couldn't get a refill on the Iced Tea.   At one point during the meal, I noticed the waiter was clearing the next table over from us.  As he did, something fell off the plate.  He looked down, saw it and instead of picking it up, he kicked it under the booth.

Paul S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,,3.0,11/12/2017,"We love this restaurant, but our most recent visit was a bad experience. Since Eataly opened, the place isn't as busy, which for us was a good thing. But the service has taken a quantum leap backward. When we walked in, no one was at the front reception area, where we waited for a good 2-3 minutes.  When the guy finally arrived, he didn't really seem interested, but sat us promptly. We had a nice waitress, but we waited a long time for the food. My entree size salad was about the size of my wife's half salad, maybe minutely larger. The waitress confirmed there was no mistake, but I sent it back anyway, only to have it returned an imperceptibly bit larger. We've been coming since it opened several months ago, and love the menu, as well as their fun promotions through the CPK app. There are a lot of new small plates...we've tried them all, and they're all delicious. It's not cheap, but still reasonably priced and good quality.

Ervin F.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,5,2,2.0,11/27/2017,"We were seated quickly, but our server offered water and...didn't bring them. Wine glasses were delivered, but they were dirty with fingerprints. Another server then delivered our appetizers; when we mentioned we got no water or place settings; he brought them, however he failed to return with my wine glass.  Even sitting next to the bar, it took too long to get clean glasses or get replacement glasses.  At this point, we called the main hostess, and she was prompt and got glasses.  However, when poring the wine, she inattentively overpoured the first wine glass when the bottle was meant to pour for 8 people!. It was all bad follow through:  No silverware.  NO water. Late delivery of silverware, water and wine glasses (albeit dirty).  The food and taste was fine.  Execution of service: POOR.  Why did they not follow thru and deliver quickly upon all requests?  We did see our first server working on other tables without first completing our requests.  And, while a birthday was mentioned, NO one followed thru nor with cake or ice cream.  We were extremely disappointed in service of CPK.  With physicians in our grop, we selected CPK for his healthier meal options, quick service and reputation.  Needless to say, we were very displeased and saddened by the terrible service.  People were polite, but delivery was lacking; NOT in keeping with CPK reputation for an exacting clientele.  While we were not charged for corkage of the wine, this is a minor benefit for the poor/lacking service; this does not in any way compensate for substandard service.  We could have celebrated with 8 people elsewhere in this high-end Century City mall, but we chose your venerable institution.  We were let down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-22?start=20

Ed E.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,111,6,4.0,8/14/2017,"This is a new location in the recently re-opened and yet to be completed multi-billion dollar renovated Century City Westfield Mall.  CPK has always done a really good job with what I  call ""California Personal Pizzas.""  They invented pizzas like the BBQ Chicken Pizza, Thai Pizza and the BLT Pizza.  Now, in this store they have expanded the menu to include a great burger, a very decent steak and a variety of tasty, large salads--Thai Crunch being my favorite.   If you were a fan of the Food Show in Beverly Hills (a CPK owned property that closed a few years back) you'll love the expanded menu at CPK.  Many familiar items are on the menu.  The pizzas are still great.  The Pepperoni Pizza is the best Pepperoni Pizza you can find anywhere.  Nice and spicy, thick cuts of pepperoni cover the pizza completely.  And yes, there are still people throwing pizza dough and putting them in the hot-draft flame WoodStone pizza ovens.  I always request a well done crisp pizza crust where the points don't droop.     It's a decent place to go for Happy Hours... good dinks and appetizers of all kinds populate the menu.  They offer luncheon specials at reasonable prices.  Service is spotty, but generally okay.  Join the Pizza Dough Club (or something like that) for deals and promotions.  The payoff is quick and often and benefits and awards go directly into your CPK account bank. Personally, I prefer this restaurant to the CPKs in Beverly Hills or Westwood.  It is more spacious.  There is ample parking available and good shopping, too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-22?start=20

Kyle W.,"Santa Monica, CA",1,22,,1.0,11/18/2017,"Worst nightmare ever. The two hostesses were confused, confusing, and vague yet polite at least. They did a poor job of managing the crowd at the door, as several people were addressed and helped who arrived after myself. I felt invisible to them. Finally I spoke up. ""Two for dinner"" I said. They told me it was a 45 minute wait. I looked around and the restaurant was only half full. I was confused. I asked why such a wait with so many empty tables. They hostesses confessed to me that the kitchen asked them to stop seating people. ""Why"", I asked. They went on to explain the kitchen was short staffed and backed up more than an hour. For a half full restaurant. Then they two hostesses directed their attention away from me to someone who stated ""just me, party of one"". They said they couldn't even sit him because they had no tables for one. I'm am just beside myself that an iconic chain restaurant such as CPK could be in such a state of confusion, mismanagement and disarray. They really need to pull it together from the top down.

The mushroom pizza wasn't good either. Waste of my time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-22?start=40
Food S.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,177,2,1.0,4/27/2017,The worst food in the new shopping plaza. Plus they charge more for the same sloppy meals as other CPKs. Total garbage chain restaurant food they try to sell as something it's not. What a waste. Never going back. Server was nice though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-22?start=40
Sam K.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,28,,1.0,6/4/2017,"As a child and now as an adult with children, I've been to dozens of CPK's all over town. By far this is the worst CPK I've ever been to. They have the worst service every time we've been there so far since they've opened. It's busy for now, but I'm sure if they don't get their act together they will lose a lot of their loyal customers once the other eateries open up in the mall. For now they're getting away with it because there's not that many choices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-22?start=40
Gisela D.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,9,1,4.0,4/12/2017,"My colleagues and I enjoyed eating at CPK today!  We tried making a reservation because this area can get pretty busy at lunchtime, but we were told seating is on a first-come, first-served basis.  When we got there, the host took our name and contact information.  While we waited, I noticed a sign outside the restaurants that reads ""call ahead for seating.""  So much for trying to make a reservation!  All in all, it took less than 10 minutes to be seated.  It was busy but service was quick. The only other issue I had was that the music was a bit too loud and it was hard to hear those at my table.  They just need to lower the volume a little.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-22?start=40
Theresa N.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,5.0,5/21/2017,"Amazing!!! Excellent staff, food was fresh and delicious !! Tyrone is the waiter to ask for he is so positive and really takes care of you!  Love this place !!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-22?start=40
Pam B.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,20,3,1.0,5/1/2017,"$22.43 for a BBQ chicken salad at takeout for lunch.  My mistake when they asked if I wanted avocado (""sure"") but even so- this is ridiculous!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-22?start=40
Albert H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,34,,5.0,5/19/2017,Great place for the fan to grub and Lupe hooked up the service in the front. John is also a great waiter. Recommended.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-22?start=40
