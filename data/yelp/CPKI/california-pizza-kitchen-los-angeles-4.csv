Brit D.,"Los Angeles, CA",249,8,,4.0,11/7/2017,Been coming here a few years. They never seem to disappoint. I Appreciate their food quality and yummy mixed drinks.

Maria M.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,7,,5.0,11/5/2017,Service is great. Fast. Friendly and helpful. Usually no wait to be seated. Food tastes fresh clean and always warm. Highly recommend their spinach and  artichoke dip. I love their bread so warm and fresh. Great place and ambiance.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-4?start=20
Linda L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,10/17/2017,"Horrible!  Food ok but I had a call in order.  They tell you to park outside on Figueroa and come in to pick up your order.  Well...my order was incorrect and while I was waiting for it to be corrected I got a parking ticket.  I rushed outside.....TOO LATE.  I told the manager and all who would listen they said ""oh wow that usually doesn't happen on the week days"".  HUH? Meanwhile I had already paid over $90 for food.   No apology, no offer to take some of the bill off, no NOTHING. So I ended up spending an additional $58 for for the day, that's just not worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-4?start=20
Dennis Y.,"San Jose, CA",32,108,121,4.0,4/16/2017,"This CPK location is at the top of the 7th and Fig shopping center. There's a shared parking garage for the entire center as well as public buses and taxis nearby.  Brenda was my server. She was very friendly and made sure to check up on us with just the right frequency. I'm not a fan of servers hovering over your table and coming by every 5 minutes. Brenda did a great job.  The food was pretty good; not superb. Ordered the works pizza and a Moroccan chicken salad. The pizza was good for the most part but the sauce and toppings started at about 2 inches in from the crust. So when I ate a slice, half was sauce and toppings while the other, larger half, was crust. The Moroccan salad was good. It needed a. It of salt though. There were a lot of sweet elements in there and it just needed some salt to bring out the tart from the dried dates. Chicken was juicy and tender, not dry at all. Was a pretty good meal overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-4?start=20
G G.,"Burbank, CA",3,28,112,3.0,10/3/2016,"2 stars for the food. We had the BBQ chicken pizza AND the BBQ chicken salad. Both were good and tasted the way you expect CPK to taste.

Erick V.,"Los Angeles, CA",159,121,222,5.0,4/10/2016,"I must have came at a perfect hour, Sunday afternoon. Great service, quick with the order, friendly staff, and great food.   I'm a huge fan of their Chinese Chicken salad. Loaded with chicken and fresh veggies. This place rocks for splitting the salad into two plates. Don't know too many that do.   Also ordered the Cajun chicken pizza. Thin crust! Comes with bacon (think that's the pizza's name).    Avoid the rush hour to get the best service. Its at a prime location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-4?start=20
Meagan E.,"Camarillo, CA",32,160,243,1.0,1/28/2017,Standard CPK but with THE WORST SERVICE! We saw our very polite waitress once every 45 mins it seemed. We asked for additional bread and oil but 20 mins later when we didnt have it she then said they were out of bread but could bring oil. She offered parmesan after we were halfway through our meal. When we sat for an eternity waiting to see her again to request a dessert menu she failed to put in all of our dessert orders which she managed to screw up twice. Then disappeared forever again. Since our waitress was consistently MIA for an eternity i asked a passing by hostesss who didnt appear to be preoccupied for a spoon- he said hed find our waitress. Just get me a damn spoon!! That would clearly be faster!! When we made arrangements to have the check split she came back saying she couldnt split it due to our FREE desserts giving her trouble in the computer. I asked her to get help from her manager. She said he was busy and itd be a while. GOODBYE. NEVER AGAIN.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-4?start=20

Gina P.,"Pico Rivera, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/25/2017,"This review is for the poor service we received tonight. Our waiter forgot about us, asked to wait when we called him over and still did not come back to us, I had to ask the hostess twice for the waiter. The waiter was obviously peeved we asked the hostess for him. I asked for another drink which another waiter brought the drink to our table, took my mother in laws half full drink, gave her my drink and I sat and waited for 15 minutes before we asked the bus boy for a drink because our waiter told us to give home a minute and he never returned. Decided to use the restroom as we waited for the check and the restroom had obviously not be cleaned. The floors were dirty, toilet paper and paper towels scattered all over the floors and the walls had not be cleaned probably ever. Gross!

We then ordered our food i always get the ribeye which comes with potatoes and a salad , so were waiting for our food and other people that got there way after us are getting their food before us, and where we are located were able to see the food going out i was able to see my food sitting there for over 10 mins that whole time i was hoping that wasnt my food and next thing you know i see our waitress get that plate and bring it to me and right off the bat u can tell my food is cold of course once i try it it was cold , my gf got her pasta hot and i sent my food back.

Maddie R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/13/2017,"I rarely write Yelp reviews, but their delivery service is one of the worst I've ever dealt with. And I eat out A LOT. They take hours for the food to come, if you call to ask about the order they will blame is on GrubHub (I rarely have issues with GrubHub), and when I asked for an approximate ETA, they couldn't even give me that. I believe the manager said they were waiting for the delivery guy to come back and had no idea when that would be. All in all, their customer service is pretty much a joke and they don't have it together at all when it comes to delivery.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-4?start=20
Dalgy P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,17,10,1.0,7/26/2016,"I'm giving 1 star because it is a damn shame what this establishment has done! Let me just say that I absolutely love CPK's Butter Cake with vanilla ice cream!!! I literally dream of it and have that least 2x a week, it is that good!  The order I placed on July 17th, the cake was delivered to me burnt and super hard. It was dark brown when it is usually a golden yellow color. The only good part was the ice cream. The photo below is of my most recent order on July 20th which came with an extra surprise...I'm guessing this is the top to their whipped cream can? Totally disgusting and just shows their lack of care. How could you not notice the bulky top fell off the whipped cream can into a takeout container? I'm sure management wouldn't care to even respond to this anyway, but just wanted to warn you guys! Inspect your food before eating it!

Kelly P.,"Los Angeles, CA",76,6,,3.0,6/21/2017,Came here for a friend's birthday to eat dinner. It started off slow as the drinks we ordered took forever and once we ordered the food it also took a while to arrive as well. We ordered some appetizers and they were given to us the same moment we got our main meal. What's the point of an appetizer if it is not given before. The appetizer was also given to us cold making us think it was probably sitting there a while and made it appear that our waiter forgot about us. 3 stars for the food as it was tasty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-4?start=20
Kevin K.,"Irvine, CA",344,8,1,1.0,5/22/2017,"My girlfriend and I came here once on my birthday a few days ago because I generally love CPK!  Food: I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps, Jamaican jerk pizza, kung pao spaghetti, and the crispy mac and cheese appetizer.  Besides the appetizer, I've gotten the other three items before and generally like them a lot. The lettuce wraps were good as always here, but the pizza was undercooked, making a thin crust pizza chewy and cold in some areas. The pasta was absolutely dreadful for some reason and everything just tasted wrong. The appetizer was not actually normal mac and cheese but actually small balls of mac and cheese that were fried. It had the worst texture, were not even hot (for a fried item) and tasted like nothing.  Service: Our server was good and upbeat. However... there was a small flyer on the table showing that if we signed up for a CPK rewards account, we would get a free small plate. So I asked the server about it and he confirmed that we could order a free small plate. I signed up on my phone and showed him everything on my phone to which he again verified that everything looked good and that we could get our free small plate. We got the mac and cheese described above, and even though it was pretty disappointing, we were fine with it because it was free. At the end of our dinner, the server came to us saying that there was some kind of error in the system and that we were going to be charged for the small plate. I told him that the only reason why we even ordered that dish was because he verified for us multiple times that it would be free and the flyer on the table even showed so. He said that he couldn't do anything and charged us the $5-6 for 4 cold, small balls of tasteless mac and cheese. We left without saying anything else because it wasn't a big deal. But, the food is the worst of any CPK location I've been to, and it was a disappointing to have an experience like that, especially on my birthday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-4?start=20
Alejandra Q.,"Hawthorne, CA",11,7,1,1.0,5/23/2017,"Ordered the lunch special yesterday. I got a Caesar salad and a small sausage and mushroom pizza.

We got pizzas, the crusts were thin and toppings plentiful. They delivered to my office of 25 people with only an hour and a half notice- *bonus*! Salads were nice and of great portions. They even provided us with extra dressing on the side *another bonus*! I ordered some shrimp rolls for myself, yum! Everything here is mouthwatering and off the chain.

Moee D.,"Manhattan, NY",1,64,41,4.0,8/16/2016,"The place itself is very clean looking and I like the decor. I usually don't go there but i thought maybe in another state I would give a try:) We came on Sunday for dinner. Place wasn't crowded which was good. I give 4 stars because of the food and the sangria which tasted more like a lemonade not an alcoholic beverage.  They gave us on the house thin crust mushroom pizza and it was delish and a very nice surprise.  We ordered a pepperoni pizza and as much as love pizza this one looked regular almost like the one I saw at 7/11. We had chicken tequila fettuccine and my friend said he liked it a lot and i got the Kung Pao spaghetti and even though it could use more chicken and less peanuts I really loved it.  The waiter was nice and attentive and he asked few times if everything was ok.  Overall a decent place, for families or friends hang out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-4?start=20

Jace I.,"Spring Valley, Las Vegas, NV",110,9,2,1.0,12/29/2016,"Servers and hosts are great.  However, my experience with management was just disappointing.  I ended up dropping my 100 dollar bill with two dollars wrapped on the outside.   As I returned to the restaurant to check under the table we sat at, a lady who sat across from our table witnessed my money on the floor once I left and told me that the busser asked her if it was her money and she said no. She said that she did see a 100 dollar bill with other two dollars as well.  I asked her if she would be willing to come with me to testify that incident. So she did. As soon as I spoke to the manager who was the Asian gentleman, he just said, there was only $2 and you can take the $2 but there was no $100 dollar bill.  OK, I get it- I'm sure if anyone picked it up they'd keep it too.   However, it was the 'I don't care' and 'I don't know' attitude that came with it. For one, I wouldn't come all that way for just $2, Two, we customers regularly bring you guys business and that in turn is your paycheck as well at least be courteous instead of just 'I don't know' or even try assist the situation with a higher authority.  I asked if there was video surveillance in this facility so I can see what happened (a nice class A building in 7th and Fig) and again, manager was saying 'No we don't.' Are you kidding me?? No video surveillance? BS.   I don't expect them to compensate me for the loss of my money, but at least ask if there's anything they can do on their end to possibly 'help'.  None of that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-4?start=20

I had mentioned to the waitress that the noodles were very overlooked and she says: ""oh that's aldente"" This is the first time that I was not offered to have the dish fixed.

Noe Z.,"San Gabriel, CA",0,35,73,3.0,12/29/2016,"CPK walks the fine line between overtly cookie cutter commercial, fine dining and hipster ready to order pies. Unfortunately, this doesn't work out to well at this location.  The decor is nice, although the seats are packed in allowing little room to enjoy the Chicken Lettuce Wraps which were quite tasty.  As my main I ordered the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine, a house favorite.  The sauce is a bit on the oily side and you have to go on an excavation for the chicken, which is actually succulent.  Although it has become an institution, it unfortunately has not escaped the trappings of commercialism.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-4?start=40

Vanessa L.,"Los Angeles, CA",114,312,602,2.0,6/17/2015,"I met some friends here for lunch on a weekday. CPK was chosen more for the location and convenience (parking validation, kid friendlier than the other 7th/Fig options) than for the food.  I didn't expect much of the food, so I can't say I was disappointed exactly, although I love food so it always saddens me when I don't particularly enjoy my meal. I ordered a half portion of the roasted veggie salad, which comes with avocado, artichokes, red and yellow bell peppers, sun dried tomatoes, eggplant, and roasted corn tossed with romaine lettuce and a Dijon vinaigrette. Sounds good, right? In execution, it was nothing like the description or, might I add, the picture online (that I'm looking at as I write this). The romaine lettuce wasn't fresh; instead of being crisp, it was soft and on the verge of wilting. The vegetables were probably overcooked; most were pretty soft and the salad overall just seemed soggy. The free bread was the best part of my meal. Our waitress was attentive, checking up on us throughout the meal. I did get tired of the repeated attempts (probably mandated by management) to sell us extras like drinks, appetizers, and desserts. I think we were asked twice about dessert.  Even with CPK being so close to my work, I wouldn't come back here unless forced again to do so for the sake of convenience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-4?start=40

Makes matter worse the manager did not acknowledge this matter plus I have to wait 14 minutes for my drink to be fixed which is not really fix. Manager didn't even bother to come to the table to see if everything's all right after that matter. It does not take that long to pour a Grey Goose on ice and peel a lemon.

Waiter took 10 minutes to greet us, we placed the exact same order at the same time as the table next to us and they got their food, paid, and left before we ever saw our food. The waiter never refilled our drinks, he tried to aggressively upsell us on literally everything, had to say no like 5 times to each upsell before he would leave you alone. He was a ghost the entire time, would just swing by to harass us on something he wanted to upsell. CPK always had a special place in my heart since it was one of the first restaurants I ate at when I arrived in California.

I know they try, and I'm sure there's some corporate push for up selling, but when I have to say no to dessert, dessert to-go and refuse a dessert menu, please take the hint. In addition, a couple was sat next to us at the same time and had already finished eating their pizza and left before we were served. We just wanted pizza to cure the Halloween hangover, man! Tall order here. The pizza is great. Pepperoni is my go to and it satisfied! They even have fresh Parmesan shaved over the pizza for you. A very nice touch. Crispy Mac and cheese bites were the kind of gluttony you hope for but without seasoning. This is one of those places I feel the need to say ""buyer beware"".

My wife ordered soup and salad. The chicken tortilla soup and chicken Caesar salad or both fresh and very tasty. The wings that we ordered his appetizers were excellent as well. I ordered salmon which was prepared perfectly along with some steamed vegetables. The prices are above average. The restrooms had an average level of cleanliness.

Honestly don't think we would even consider coming here if it wasn't for coupon.  Perhaps because we came in the middle of summer, it seems like this location is managed mainly by college students/high school kids? Our server appeared busy joking around with other servers and disappeared for most our service. Breads and water were only brought out after repeated reminder and when our main dishes were also brought out. Breads with pizzas? Perfect pairing I suppose?  Carne asada pizza for the husband and original BBQ chicken pizza for me. The original BBQ chicken was way way way too sweet. Doused almost entirely in just sauces with a sprinkle of chicken/red onion. Where was the cheese? The carne asada was much tastier - served with bubbling, gooey cheese and actually came with a good amount of meats. Wished we ordered two of these.  Would advise not to sit by the window during the summer - the ac wasn't strong enough, I spent majority of the meal fanning myself with the menu.

I came here with a group of friends for dinner on a Wednesday night and it was an enjoyable experience. The CPK is in the 7th and fig plaza so you can park in the parking structure and get it validated there and pay a small fee before returning to your car.  My group had a reservation made and it was good because it was ready for us on time, but there wasn't that many people there on a Wednesday night to begin with I guess, we went around 7:30 pm.  The food was good, and you can ask for cheese if you order a pasta and would like more cheese and they have chili flakes for their spice but I guess it was more so for my friend who had ordered a pizza...The one thing that I thought was weird was how my fettucinie noodles were green and they were also a little more chewier than I would have liked, but that could just be because of the way that I normally cook my noodles. Why they didn't get 5 stars? It was just the time that it took to wait for the waiter to decide to take all the orders and to take the orders because he went in w circle instead of zig zag which was weird for a group of 15.

Its a pretty good outlet with an outdoor seating and all. Is a pizza place so obviously a little noise, not that i mind. I called for the mushroom spinach feta cheese flatbread, and as a promotional activity was given that for free, first visit, when i filled out a small coupon like thing. We also called for the fetucini pasta in vodka sauce (the only thing i love here) and a half and half tortilla and the farmers market soup. The fetucini pasta is the best thing on their menu, i love it. The flatbread was delicious was stuffed with mushrooms and spinach and yet was so light and crunchy.

Once you exit the parking garage and walk towards the shopping area, you'll have to go to the 3rd floor (street level of Figueroa) to access the restaurant.

Ordered the Thai Crunch salad, arugula salad, and the mushroom + spinach flatbread. All three tasted very yummy!

It's a Hand-wrapped crispy wonton rolls filled with avocado, chicken, tomato, smoked bacon and cheese I believe. Served with housemade dressing don't know what's called and ranch. I got my usual delicious plate KUNG PAO SPAGHETTI Chinese classic with garlic, scallions, peanuts and hot red chilies you can either get it with it chicken or shrimp only or both so I get it with both Chicken & Shrimp. Really delicious a must try. My gf in the other hand got one of her favorite's PESTO CREAM PENNE Freshly made basil pesto cream sauce with tomatoes and Parmesan. You can also get either get it with it chicken or shrimp only or both so she got it with shrimp only it was also delicious. And for dessert you can go wrong with my favorite cake the RED VELVET CAKE served with ice cream delicious mouth watering Definitely will be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-4?start=60

For some reason, the garlic chicken pizza is no longer on the menu at any of the CPK locations, but they will make it for you. Their spaghetti bolognese is one of my favorite pastas and their chicken piccata comes in a strong second with the perfect cream sauce. If you sign up for their CPK card, you accumulate points every time you dine there which you can use toward getting free appetizers. Since this location caters mainly to the surrounding office buildings and lunch crowd, in the evenings it's usually pretty quite and there is never a wait.

My husband ordered Fetuccine tequila and there was barely any chicken. I ordered their Asparagus Spinach spaghetti plate and was expecting something to what I saw online in the photos.  The veggies were OVER Cooked and it was full of bland spaghetti with barely any cheese. Did not enjoy my DINNER at all...We paid $63 including 15% tip. The waiter never once consider taking the plates from the appetizers, it was crowding the space of our table, if it wasn't because I mention it to her, she was not attentive at all.  The ladies bathroom is completely gross, it looks like they do not clean the toilets, empty their trash, or clean their disgusting walls. I cannot imagine what type of Hygiene they have when  cooking my meals.  This place seemed pretty empty for Saturday evening, its no coincidence because this place is run so unprofessional, there employees reflect poor manners and service. For dessert I ordered a regretful Red Velvet that was completely disgusting! It tasted extremely OLD from being refrigerated. Not impressed by anything at all.

The bartender on the other hand was blehh despite it being early on in the night before the Kings game even started. Their bbq chicken pizza is soooo good! Highly recommend it. However, one of the reasons I took off half a star is because it's pretty much an individual sized pizza for $10!! Pretty pricey in my opinion, but it is Staples Center so I guess it's to be expected. Their appleberry sangria was also pretty good, but it comes served in a plastic cup, not one of those big, round, cool glasses it shows in their picture. :/ That was my reason for taking off an additional half a star.

The slightly overpriced pizza I got was okay, not as good as I once remembered (a couple of years ago at another CPK location). For a few bucks more, I've could have gotten a massive pizza at one of the local pizza joints.  I did like the fact they had a take out for people on the go.

Johnson G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,299,198,2.0,9/8/2012,"I previously reviewed the Arcadia location and gave it 5 stars. That was before this ""reinvention"" that has apparently happened chain-wide. Came here for a lunch with co-workers, about 18 of us.  Service was good, though I notice that the servers are wearing t-shirts with various descriptions of menu items or slogans.  I don't think these kinds of t-shirts belong at a full-service restaurant.  I think they're better suited for grocery stores or fast food chains, but not for CPK. The starter bread came out, and it looked - and tasted - nothing like the sourdough loaves I've come to know.  This was plain white bread. It tasted boring.  I shouldn't even have bothered with the oil and balsamic vinegar - it was a waste of oil and balsamic vinegar. The menu has been down-sized, certainly in the pizza section. And see my picture of one of the display messages at the table.  Sure seems like they want to stick with what they want to serve, not necessarily what you want to have. Lunch: I had the California Club pizza on honey-wheat crust.  I shouldn't have strayed from original crust.  My supervisor wasn't happy with her Thai Chicken pizza.  She complained the carrots, typically baked with the pizza, were now raw and tough.

However, the best part of my meal was the drink. I had a white peach sangria that was freaking amazing. It probably the best I've had anywhere and now every time I go out and have sangria I compare it to the one at CPK.

Training tip for the corporate yahoos at CPK. Train employees to at least apologize if your meal does not come out and you have to take it to go.

Ed T.,"Long Beach, CA",0,16,9,2.0,4/10/2015,"This is my first review and I normally don't do this but I just can't resist to make a review for this restaurant today.     Anyway, I went to the restaurant at around 1:00 pm April 8, 2015. It was somewhat slow. As I went in with family, we were seated at the corner.  After sitting, I had a different feeling from the last time I went there. Last time was more inviting and the service was awesome, however, today wasn't as I expected.     First reason, the ambiance was wrong. It doesn't look as inviting as it used to be. But that one is not really problem. One problem I noticed is the service. The server came to us asking us if we been to this restaurant before WITHOUT introducing his name. I also notice that we didn't get serve a garlic bread when most of the tables served seem to have one. Last one is, as we hand out the check with our payment, the server asked ""Would you like your change""? I used to work in a restaurant and this isn't the way I approach my guest. The proper way to is to tell them that ""I'll be right back with your change"". I honestly think the server we had seems to have no experienced on food service.     Overall, we felt that our experience wasn't satisfying and inviting. Probably because of the clothes we wore that we look cheap that we were not served appropriately. There's room for improvement and we will still come back which will take a while and hopefully by that time, we see some improvement with the atmosphere and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-4?start=100

I had the guacamole with chips as an appetizer and that was a 10/10. The food is good... I guess it's just the ambiance and feel of this place that makes it less enjoyable.

Zoe B.,"Pasadena, CA",0,7,,1.0,7/14/2015,"Shame on CPK! I have never been so disgusted in my entire life. There are no words to describe the feeling that I have right now towards this company. I cannot imagine myself eating here again.  A few of us were recently at this particular location and we decided to sit at the bar. I am so glad that we decided to sit there, because now I know who the people are that cook the food for this restaurant. Let me start off by saying that I am a proud Mexican-American. I work near this location, so I have been coming to this CPK for a little over a year now. Make no mistake though, I will never eat at ANY CPK location anymore. I cannot believe that they hire such disgusting people to work for them. On this day, I was the only woman in our group who spoke Spanish fluently so I was the only person who could understand what was being said between the restaurant staff. Thank goodness for that, because the people that I was with would not tolerate what happened on this day. If they understood the words that were exchanged between the staff, they would of raised hell.  So, after a few minutes of sitting down, I heard someone cursing in Spanish. I kid you not, I heard every foul word in the dictionary. I was shocked. I started to listen closely and found that the kitchen staff (mostly the men) laughing about someone's private area and cursing extremely loud. I don't know if they were drunk, but they sounded like they were all intoxicated. I heard the cooks in the kitchen say things that would just blow my mind away. I cannot begin to tell you how bad the words were. I couldn't hear clearly as to exactly what the story was, but the way they were speaking was absolutely unacceptable. It was ridiculous. I haven't heard that kind of Spanish and foul language in years. The funny thing is that the cooks were shouting so loud that I could hear them all the way at the bar where we were all sitting. Thankfully, they were speaking Spanish, but the words that they were using were so bad that I had to tell our group what was going on. I couldn't eat the food that was put on the counter. I couldn't hold myself anymore. All I could hear were curse words and the staff laughing like hyenas. (Which was the most annoying laugh I ever heard) Once I told my friends what the cooks were saying, I noticed that they were extremely disappointed and I knew that they wanted to leave just as much as I did.  At this point, we were all upset and just listening to the kitchen staff shout and laugh, while hearing curse words in Spanish. Can you imagine this at a restaurant? The interesting part about all of this was that the young girls who were working at the take out area were hearing all of this. I could see them coming by the bar and looking as if they were embarrassed. The cooks didn't care that there were women around them. They kept going...There was one girl that I caught laughing along with the cooks which shocked me even more. I am sorry, but I do NOT want these type of people cooking my food. It's just bad energy in that kitchen. It is disgusting to cook while cursing and talking about a woman's private area. That is just wrong in so many ways. I wouldn't even want to be in the same room as someone like that, let alone let them cook my food. The staff in kitchen was just unbelievably disgusting. Shame on the managers for condoning this type of behavior. At one point, I even saw the manager go to the kitchen, hear them cursing and talking about inappropriate things, and literally giggled and walked away.  My goodness, if the people inside that restaurant knew who was cooking their food, and what they were talking about while cooking it, they wouldn't eat there anymore.

I had their half portion field green salad for lunch which was field greens with bosc pears, candied walnuts, and a dijon balsamic vinaigrette.. It was the perfect portion for one person cuz their regular salads are humongous.. I also had a few bites of the chimichurri chicken which had really tasty bites of sauteed cauliflower [: My favorite item off their menu during this trip was definitely the mango mojito! It was so good I had to have more than one haha.. I'm not a fan of mint or mojitos but when you throw in some fruit I'm all in!

I would come back here for the drinks alone! 2 margaritas, 2 mojitos, 2 half portion salads, and the chimichurri chicken rang our bill up to a steep $70..

Monique B.,"Seal Beach, CA",0,20,,5.0,2/9/2015,"We have been visiting this location for many years. However, we had not been here for over a few years.  So, several weeks ago, my husband brought our daughter and I here to celebrate our birthdays.  Thomas was our server and he was superb!  He was extremely professional and contagiously friendly.  He really took our dining experience light years beyond our expectations.  There were four of us in our party and Thomas took our orders flawlessly without needing to write down a thing.  Initially, my husband questioned Thomas on his method of not writing the orders down and he gladly offered to write them down if we'd like...my husband then said to him, ""by all means carry on with your means of order taking.""  He politely continued, and upon completion he repeated our orders back to us perfectly! He then hand delivered each of our meals personally; we truly appreciated this because you hardly see this practiced anymore. When a waiter personally brings you your meal (instead of having someone else deliver it for them) they stay in control of their guests dining experience.   Thomas was not only efficient he also anticipated our every need. When he saw that I had covered my hot plate of pasta with a napkin to keep it warm, he asked if he could take it back to the kitchen and redeliver it when I was ready to have it. I have covered my plate scores of times in the past at other restaurants (not just at CPK's) and Thomas was the only one to ever offer this service to me. It is because of Thomas that we had such a pleasurable dining experience during our visit that night...he created such a wonderful environment for us because of the ""excellent service"" he provided.  And because of that he was our main topic of conversation all the way back to our home and we live about a half hour from this CPK location. We would like to thank the upper management for choosing Thomas to work with the company...CPK is fortunate to have him...he is golden; he is the type of employee that employers dream about...take good care of him. Thomas, thank you very much for helping to make this location one that we will definitely keep coming back to.  We all really enjoyed the good food and we appreciated your warmth, kindness and professionalism.

The service is over the top and tried to hard to seem ""caring"". The worst part was that they kept forgetting what I asked for such as a fork or a refill(which took 15 minutes). Also, they do not offer validation. Not that this is an issue, because its a separate matter. However, the waiter who served acted as there was validation and even stamped it. When I exit, the fee pops out at 3$. I'm confused and have to walk all the way back to the restaurant only to discover they didn't offer validation. I ask to them why they even took my ticket then?

And the portions are generous! Even the half portion is a lot, and it leaves me stuffed. I finally decided to try the Moroccan chicken salad, and I actually like it, although it's definitely on the sweet side. The service here is great. All the times I've been here, the servers were attentive and came by several times to see if we needed anything. And the food usually doesn't take too long to come out.

Maybe it's my luck of the draw but my servers are always attentive and knowledgable about the menu when I dine here. I had no problems with the service.  Now for the food:  Tricolore Pizza Salad: one of my favorites. Cold salad on top of a crispy thin crust. The crust has cheese and is a tad sweet. The salad and pizza crust are a perfect balance. I like getting my crust undercooked so its a tad chewier. I ALWAYS get salmon on top! totally worth the $4.50.  Chicken Tequila Fett. : This pasta is definitely interesting. Green noodles?! but yes its really good. I've never tasted anything like it. I always get extra lime on the side.  Peach Iced Tea: I will either get the peach or mango iced tea. I usually ask for a light syrup cause i like my iced tea on the more tea than sweet side.    Spinanch Dip: The best spinach dip from a chain restaurant.

The service is slow, no matter if you come right when they open or when it's 1 pm in the afternoon on Saturday. Getting food out is slow too.

CPK is no gourmet pizza, but I think their innovative approach of using flavors from all over the world makes them unique.  I just think that their dishes are a hit of a miss.  I am a big fan of their sicilian pizza but not a fan of their salad pizza...

The only items I ever got here at the location were salads and pizzas, but these items are all you need for a good lunch or dinner!  I figured you can get a cobb, waldorf, or caesar salad anywhere, so I've only tried the Miso Shrimp and Grilled Vegetable Salads, which are very good. Of all the pizzas I've tried, my favorites are Vegetarian with Japanese eggplant, Pear & Gorgonzola, and Tricolore.  Sadly I did not get to try the Mango Tandoori Chicken, for I heard that was a good one.  I would suggest getting the honey wheat crust, and if you are a bread crust lover like me, get a thin crust on top of that.  It makes the pizza taste so  authentic, though I've never tried a real Italian pizza before.

Although it's called California PIZZA Kitchen, I usually don't get their pizzas. I personally don't think they're THAT great... but they DO have a wide variety!

Ironically, their sign was broken too so the lights in the word, ""pizza"" went out so it only said ""California Kitchen."" HA!  :P My favorite thing to get here is the Chopped BBQ Chicken Salad. MMM! There's just something about it! I love how they put in corn, and their sauce is really good too! Not too heavy, not too light--just right. Their salads come in half sizes or full sizes. Usually, the half-size is perfect for me and I can finish it if I'm hungry. Their appetizers are good~ I like their spinach artichoke dip! As for drinks, I love their peach iced tea!

The waitress even volunteered to bring the recipe list that had all the ingredients listed.  I ordered the Moroccan Salad, which was really colorful and very filling. I'm not a big fan of beets, but it didn't diminish the salad.  I also tasted the Tequila Fettuccine, which was really creamy and has a slight tangy taste to it. It was delicious though.

Sure, their restaurants all look the same, they serve a mishmash of ""safe"" and boring foods disguised as eclectic, but there is a lot to be said for their consistency. I try my best to glaze over the mandated nutritional information listed on the menu because the food, in general, is terrible for you...but  - damn.

The chicken fettuccine is a great tasting way to eat a 3,000 calories in one sitting. Speaking of calories, I also enjoy their spinach/artichoke dip and and red sangria.

Downtown is empty on a Sunday night and with the heat, it was a perfect night to eat outside.  Friend had the new chicken pesto pasta. Okay, a little too creamy and thick with flavor. He couldn't finish the whole dish because it was too rich. May want to pass on this.  One fun thing to share - this CPK all of a sudden has really young waiters and waitresses. One in particular had on double diamonds (meaning a diamond stud earring in each ear) and they were huge. I don't understand this style. I guess I'm old school but no matter who has on the earrings, they always look like a girl. The rest all looked like they were in college. Just an observation.

I usually go with the BBQ chicken pizza (a staple you can't go wrong with) but I thought I'd mix it up a little bit and got the chicken club sandwich. The herb onion focaccia bread it came on was delicious, but the chicken was curiously much colder than the rest of the sandwich (maybe that's what I should have expected, ordering a club sandwich, but it struck me as odd when I bit into it). The caesar salad that accompanied it was standard and was a decent size portion. From my experience visiting this and other CPK's the portions are generally very good and the prices are quite reasonable. I had a great experience with our server and we had a great time there. The restaurant was a little louder than normal, but it was a busy lunch rush, so I'll let it slide.

People usually know what to expect and, usually, I find myself more encouraged to write reviews if I either love or hate the place. First off, I will say I've never really had an issue with this location. I like CPK. Their waldorf is delicious. Pizza is delicious. But, on my last visit, I left this place super pissed off. Why? The least they can do is give you decent service. I hate having to flag down other servers, chase down any employee that works in the restaurant, and spend a ridiculously long time waiting for my bill. The food was good. We were able to order right away and everything was going along smoothly as usual. We came to eat at CPK since we had a promotion card from an earlier visit. It requires a manager to open it and let you know what discount or prize you've won. We had it sitting on our table the entire time and our server brought us our check without saying anything about it. So we told her we wanted to use it and she said she'd have a manager come to our table. After a brief wait, we get our card opened and he said he'd have our discount applied and we'd get our revised bill. We wait again and it takes our server awhile to get back to us. When she does finally arrive, the discount was not applied. We wait AGAIN (and this isn't just a minute or two, but more like 5-10 minutes) and I put my card in right away and leave it on the edge of the table. 5 minutes. 10 minutes. Nothing. We don't even see our server running around so we can flag her down. A hostess seats a group next to us so we hand off our bill to her and tell her we're ready to pay. Wait some more. 5 minutes. 10 minutes. Nothing. We see the hostess holding doors for people, seating them, and we're left wondering if she handed off our bill to another server to process. Boyfriend gets fed up and just walks up to a server that happens to be at a register to ask for our card back. He swings by our table to let us know he's getting out server for us. She pops in (I guess she was outside?) and drops off our card. No apologies for the wait, no thanks for coming, seriously, NOTHING.  This is the first time where I was pissed enough to not want to leave a tip. I leave a minimum of 15% even for semi-crappy service, but having to sit there for over 30 minutes to PAY? That's flat out ridiculous. I'm hesitant about swinging by here again. I'd rather drive a bit further and eat at another location.

The pastas and salads there are great, you will enjoy this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-4?start=240
jac n.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",48,146,,1.0,12/4/2012,"Ordered food to go, was ready almost 30 mins after the time they said. This is downtown, people are working and cannot spend time waiting for food. No apology, just a bunch of incompetent workers walking around doing nothing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-4?start=240
Yi H.,"New York, NY",2,71,1,3.0,2/24/2010,I'm not a big fan of CPK but I absolutely love their grilled vegetable salad. I usually have to call ahead of time to order or else it's a 15-20 minutes wait at the take-out window (in addition to standing in line to order). I've only gone into the restaurant once for lunch with a group of co-workers. I don't remember too much but the service was kind of slow.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-4?start=280
Fun T.,"San Diego, CA",0,25,10,1.0,3/26/2012,"A fly in my salad! That's right, a dirty crusted fly was in the crevice of lettuce in the ceasar salad I ordered. Now, the experience wasn't entirely bad, at least the waitress and the manager acknowledged the little critter and didn't charge me or my companion for the meal. But seriously now, I mean, c'mon, I get that sometimes things like that happen, BUT, what really disturbed me was their answer. An answer that sounded like they were trained to say it. Now i'm paraphrasing, but it kind of went like this. ""Well, i'm very sorry about that, but it's not as uncommon as you think. Since we don't use foods with pesticides, occassionally there are small bugs that remain on the food."" WOW!!! This was said by both the waitress and the restaurant manager! Really CPK, I appreciate that you're environmentally friendly, but aren't you guys paying your cooks to wash the foods before they prepare them. Oh but wait, it gets worse... so I'm reading through other Yelp reviews about CPK and what do I find?! Yelpers are writing the same thing! They are finding bugs in their food! This is not OK. This is down right disgusting and a major health issue!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-4?start=280
