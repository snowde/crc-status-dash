Ralph P.,"Buena Park, CA",1545,184,845,2.0,2/11/2012,"If you have been to a CPK restaurant outside of an airport, don't make the mistake of thinking this airport CPK is anywhere even remotely as good a the full service locations.  The $10 personal pizzas are not much different than the cardboard they come in. Toppings are minuscule and beyond skimpy in their rationing of anything other than stale dough. The clerk at the register spoke in some unintelligible arab dialect outside of Damascus. A little English or Spanish might be appropriate for LAX!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-8?start=20

Dawn S.,"Woodland Hills, CA",269,261,80,3.0,6/18/2008,"Actually, gals...there IS pizza. But if you're expecting the full CPK menu, you're going to be extremely disappointed, because they only have 4 choices (I think) -- cheese, pepperoni, thai chicken and hawaiian!  But yes, there's the pre-prepared salad and sandwiches line as well. I stopped here for some grub before the Delta flight from hell (four words - ""medial emergency on board""). Albeit, it wasn't like eating at a REAL CPK, but for 30K feet, it would have to do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-8?start=20
Stephanie B.,"Birmingham, AL",83,441,29,2.0,12/6/2010,"I guess it's better than plane food, but it's not better than food on the outside. First they took 15 minutes to cook (which they did at least warn us about) but after 25 minutes they appeared to have lost my pizza. It was a margarita pizza and instead of making another one he just sprinkled some basil on cheese and sent me on my way (why margarita pizzas are $1.50 more I'll never know). So thumbs up for improvising and getting me on my merry way. Thumbs down for screwing up in the first place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-8?start=20

Josh S.,"Mableton, GA",57,293,4,2.0,12/8/2010,"I love pizza so I'm always down for some pizza. Being in the LAX airport headed back home after Thanksgiving we decided to share a pizza and a salad. We ordered the Margherita pizza and were warned it would take about 15 minutes. No problem, we could eat our Cobb salad first then get to the pizza. The Cobb wasn't bad, pretty on par for what you get at these places. After about 25 minutes we up to the counter since our order was 29 and they had just called 35. I think they had given our pizza away so they just sprinkled some basil on a cheese pizza and handed it to us. We were hungry so we just took the pizza but seriously, how hard is it go get a pizza order right at one of these places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-8?start=20
Saki U.,"Santa Monica, CA",46,41,13,2.0,10/7/2010,"Ordered a veggie pizza from CPK at LAX. Veggie...hmmm..more like, eat this pizza that I usually will throw away any day as it was mainly just mushrooms, olives and, 3 small thin and pathetic pieces of green pepper. Green pepper, which I was hoping would dominate my 'veggie' pizza. Not worth ordering this ""vegetarian"" pizza if you want that veggie satisfying meal. Might as well just grab the salad to go or give up on the vegetarian experience at this CPK in LAX.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-8?start=20
Jeev S.,"Sunnyvale, CA",21,128,8,2.0,7/9/2008,For the CPK on Terminal 7 (United Airways Terminal) The pizza sucked badly. There were six pieces of chicken on the entire pizza and I wondered did I really get the Chicken Garlic Pizza I had ordered.  I would not have mind if they had charged me $5 for this pizza.

Antonella D.,"Oakland, CA",166,207,196,3.0,6/28/2010,Pizzas are small like personal size for $10ish 11 dollars. It is great to get right before getting on a plane though. Perfect idea!!

Charito C.,"Los Angeles, CA",296,240,27,3.0,5/28/2012,"In general I really enjoy CPK; however, i can't have high expectations for the airport CPK. I feel like every time I go they run out of the pizza I am craving, and this was yet again the case when I traveled on Friday night. I ended up getting a sandwich, which wasn't bad, but I made the mistake of eating half and putting the other half back in the container, only to have it accidentally dropped by the jerk next to me who merely picked it up and apologized. That was my dinner dude, next time, pay me half of what that sandwich cost since you dropped it. If you are starving at the airport, try it, otherwise if you can, go to the actual restaurant. Love the artichoke dip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-8
Dave F.,"Santa Monica, CA",301,1484,174,3.0,12/17/2011,CPK's ready made salads are a healthy alternative in an airport terminal full of junk dining.

Sean B.,"San Francisco, CA",2247,2841,1486,2.0,4/13/2011,"In theory, the airport locations of these chain restaurants are a smaller version of the same place with a limited menu (for speed), more employees (for speed), and a specific mission (speed). Why, then, do they always seem completely disinterested in moving quickly? I want to see an airport location of ANYTHING look like Season One of ""ER"". I want things to be barked out, I want to see people rushing. I want a sense of importance and urgency, because about 25% of the people in line are scrambling to get their needs met (did I mention speed) and get to the flight they're running late for.

Mike H.,"San Francisco, CA",139,305,3,1.0,12/28/2011,"Worst margherita pizza I've ever eaten. Years have passed since my last stop at a CPK though my previous meals had at least been mediocre. This food, though, was offensively bad. How bad was it?! I wish I'd walked farther in the terminal to eat at McDonald's. Seriously. There's no telling why my dad is convinced their pizza is pretty good. The cheese actually tasted worse than the dough, which was especially problematic because it was the dominant topping. Hardly any sauce. And btw, my family calls me ""cheese boy"" because I like cheese so much. I'm going to bust out my laptop now in the hope that at least one person will be warned away from this place. Keeping this review in draft form on my phone does the public a disservice. I will say that the cashiers are pleasant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-8
Aaron F.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",216,424,,3.0,11/24/2011,"This place isn't THAT bad. Yes, they put the pizza together quickly but for whatever reason take forever to cook.

John B.,"Manchester, NH",261,433,1708,2.0,3/23/2010,"So I haven't had anything to eat for a few hours and I really wanted pizza...REALLY. Sadly this was all I could find. This CPK doesn't have the complete menu. You can chose from BBQ Chicken, pepperoni, cheese, hawaiian and some others...and salad Also, keep in mind that is is an airport and prices are going to be ridiculous. I paid $10 for one hawaiian pizza. It was ready in about 5 minutes and looked edible. However, it was quite disappointing as the cheese was bland and the sauce was much too sweet. Also, the crust was soggy.  It  reminded me of my childhood days when I would eat those pizza lunchables with sauce in a packet...gross.  As for service, they were pretty friendly and the food did arrive rather quickly. I was worried that I wouldn't have time to eat but they did a good job and I had time to spare.  In short: horrible food and price, ok service, I'll be sure to look around for more places to eat next time I'm in LAX.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-8
Santi T.,"Phoenix, AZ",363,510,1309,3.0,7/1/2009,"If you had to choose between an in-flight boxed meal or a made to order pizza on a 5 & 1/2 hour flight, which would you pick?!? No brainer! Before hopping onto my United Airlines flights, I've come here several times to the last section of terminal 7 to grab a hot, decent pizza or ready made salad. I usually get the bbq chicken pizza ($10ish) which takes about 5-8 minutes to bake after you order it. To me, it's pretty good being made at the airport and it has less grease compared to a pizza made from Pizza Hut.  Besides 4-6 different pizzas available, they sell ready made salads, soups, chips and a few desserts. If you're lucky, you might find some pre-made salads in the refrigerated section. The Thai chicken salad rocks! Next door is a bar if you need a little cocktail to chill with. Basically, this stuff tastes better at 35,000ft!

Jennifer L.,"Cypress, CA",626,230,18,1.0,7/18/2011,"Don't ever take antibiotics without food when your Dr. tells you not to...well I did & was regretting it in the line at TSA. So finally to salvage myself under desperation I went to the first food place I could get ahold of..CPK To Go. I waited in the line & I figured being a ""to-go"" place, they definitely take frozen pizzas & put them in a open oven.  I got a reminscent feeling of the fake pizza they make in Peru...cold,frozen, & they stick it in the oven...definitely was obssessed with pizza as a kid & everytime I got food poisoning. So I felt the fear as I uttered the words ""I'll have the bbq chicken pizza.""  Then the lady at the counter gave me my total with a small water bottle...$17!!!! For a small water & a personal pizza effff!!! What do you expect at LAX over priced airport food. Nonetheless I was still in pain with an empty stomach. My pizza finally arrived & I ate it half of it so quick so stop the pain.  Once it went away I started gaining my rational part of my mind back. WTF was I eating!!! It was burnt to crisp, literally the bottom of the pizza was completely black!! I could feel the carcinogens going down my digestive system...aahhh!! Downed my water & vowed to never eat there again on my trips to LAX. I also encountered a sighting from the weirdo himself ""Terminal""   ...super awkward especially when I forgot to turn off my flash & he turned around just for it to go off in his face lol -___-  Definitely will never eat here again!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-8

Having not had any 'western"" food for more than two weeks, I was torn between the pizza and a southwest food joint. Looking back I think I would have been better off in the SW joint. I ordered a pepperoni mushroom and sausage pie. They pulled it out of a warmer.  At this time I knew I was in trouble. The pie was accoualy better than I thought it might be, but remember, 16 days in Asia does things to your taste buds.

Enrique G.,"Los Angeles, CA",241,500,322,1.0,11/18/2011,"Just when I thought I had the worst pizza in the world I find this place. Rarely do I give a place 1 star but with the bad after taste still lingering how could I forget this place. Yes all airport food is over priced but how often do you find 10 dollar pizza that taste this awful. I should have read the warning signs from the start, random receipt numbering system, easy bake oven style cooking, why didn't I see it. This is the first time I regret spending money on airport food. Yet here I am forcing myself to chew every slice left due to the guilt of wasting. Remember the poor children are starving I thought so I finished the entire thing. How could anyone go wrong with pizza, I mean its so simple, cheese, sauce, bread, and topping. I think I'll give myself a migraine over analyzing the incident. I thought to be pieces of chicken tended to remind me of old jerky bits with greasy cheese. Buyer beware, if you are in desperation, go else where or suffer the consequences like your fellow yelper.

Kim M.,"Bartlett, IL",111,298,23,1.0,3/28/2011,"Dear LAX California Pizza Kitchen, If you hand out receipts with numbers on it, and then call people back for their orders simply saying what was ordered and not using a number -- I'm not sure how I'm supposed to know that the pepperoni pizza is mine or not.

Jamie S.,"Oakland, CA",51,303,60,1.0,4/25/2011,"Really bad margherita pizza. Like really bad. Cheese pizza with some basil slivers on top. Not very many basil slivers at that. Cheese got thick and coagulated and it took a while to get the pizza. I've had the Barbecue chicken pizza here before and while it was still not the same quality as a restaurant CPK, it was definitely better than the margherita (slightly cheaper too, I think).  Service was rude too. I had waited a while so when they called a pizza I just went up and said I got a margherita pizza, but I did not think that was my number. Apparently I was reading the wrong number on the receipt, because the cashier just takes my receipt and says ""you're number ninety"" while pushing the pizza at me. She was very short with me. I know your job sucks, but I'm paying a ridiculously marked up price for a tiny, low quality pizza at LAX. neither of us want to be here, so if I'm being pleasant, I would hope you could put out the same effort.  Sad to say, if I have to wait a while at LAX, I'll probably eat here again because everywhere else is just as expensive and low quality and there's a bar across the way. The restaurants at LAX make me feel as though they all agreed to put out bad food and work as little as possible because they know they'll get customers no matter what.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-8

Casey H.,"Cape May Court House, NJ",31,113,8,1.0,6/1/2010,"Given the choice between coach airplane food and CPK, I would take coach airplane food.  CPK should be ashamed of this poor excuse of a pizza restaurant.   I grabbed a Strawberry Odwalla from a dark refrigerated rack containing beverages.  The drink was warmed to room temperature.  It appeared that the unit either failed or was switched off, which none of the staff seemed to care about.  Odwalla is extremely perishable and who knows how long it was switched off, or if they'd just keep it on the shelf after someone turned it back on. You get a choice of maybe 4-5 different types of boxed pizzas.  Due to the very short cooking times, its likely that it was previously frozen or maybe refrigerated.   The pizza was not very flavorful or pleasant looking, and was CPK in nothing but name.  If you called it a Pizza Hut Express, id believe it.  Since we already were about 30 dollars into this ""meal"" and aren't ones to waste, we reluctantly finished anyway.  However, it took longer than usual as we had to bat at flies who were dive-bombing us and trying to land on our food.  I don't think i've ever seen a swarm of flies at an airport before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-8
