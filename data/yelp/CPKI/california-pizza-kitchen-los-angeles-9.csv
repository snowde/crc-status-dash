Skylar L.,"Van Nuys, CA",261,455,44,3.0,5/13/2008,"Went here on Saturday. My mom and I were going to go to another Italian restaurant near by, but the wait was over an hour. I knew that CPK was close by and I was hungry. We got there and were immediately seated. Our waiter was pretty quick to show up. My mom ordered a Gun Ricky and I ordered a vodka gimlet. Soon the manager came over to our table, ""Excuse me, but what's in a Ricky?"" Really? So after my mom told him how to make the drink our waiter delivered a Gin Ricky and a....Gibson. Really? I don't mind the occasional Gibson so I didn't say anything, but a martini with a cocktail onion and a vodka and lime drink are two very different things. I thought both of them were common, maybe not?  About ten minutes after we ordered I realized that we never got our bread. Apparently CPK is phasing it out and you have to ask for it. So uncool. That bread is so good. I know that the price of food is going up, but with the $10 salads they could give me some bread.  The food was the same as any other CPK. I love the Grilled Vegetable Salad. The kid's pasta and tomato sauce is delicious too.  CPK is one of those places I go to when I'm eating with a party with little kids around. Or I don't want to think. I didn't have any wee ones about and I wanted a good meal so I was disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-9
Jennifer L.,"Oakland, CA",287,1045,86,4.0,2/28/2008,"Typically the only time I eat at CPK is at an airport - their smashed pea and barley soup is a safe, delicious, and satisfying vegetarian/vegan option.  Between flights I look forward to a bowl of soup. Now everything has changed.  CPK is located in the same shopping complex as my gym.  I must say that after a good workout nothing tastes better than one of their salads . . . and a drink. And if it is your turn to cook and the other is looking for hearty and your looking for light, the mushroom ravioli goes over quite well.   CPK and I are just beginning are relationship, but it has the signs of being long-term.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-9
Michael C.,"Saratoga, CA",219,257,19,3.0,10/15/2007,"It's been a while since I last went to a CPK, and while traveling in LA, my gf wanted to have pasta, so we cruised down Sunset, and found CPK there. Since it's been a while since I last went to a CPK, I must have forgotten the size of portions there.  I ordered a pizza, and asked the waitress if it is good size for one person, and she told me that it was, so I ordered that and a house salad.  Turns out that I could have split the salad and pizza, and still be satisfied.  Oh well, no big deal. Being that it is a chain restaurant, it was pretty much like any of the ones I have been to in the Bay Area, and nothing overly special, but it definitely did the job.   The funny thing is that all weekend, I was begging my gf to go with me to Roscoe's, but she just wasn't in the mood for chicken, but promised me that we will go next time we're down there... :D",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-9
Nancy Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",880,488,1372,3.0,3/7/2009,"Tried the spaghetti, pretty good, lots of tasty stewed tomatoes. The chicken dumpling appetizers were okay, the ginger sauce is good though.  I thought $8 for 6 really small dumplings is over priced for what it is.  I thought it was a little uncomfortable here, the long tables and atmosphere is not my favor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-9
Sean S.,"Oakland, CA",365,930,5,2.0,3/3/2007,"Am I really the first one to review this restaurant? Really? I think I reviewed this very site in the early days of Yelp, when it was a Wolfgang Puck Cafe.  I said then it was a glorified and more expensive version of CPK. Scratch that, CPK is an expensive version of CPK. Admittedly, it's been a few years since I had last been to a CPK. I avoided there fare for, o just about any other restaurant. On this night, my sister & her roommate wanted to go cheap. Well had we known the 3 of us were gonna rack up a $75 tab on spinach dip and salads, we would have headed to Fabiolus. Our server, anemic in personality, was a trainer.  This got her lots of coverage from my sister, a RW, Recovering Waitress. The food however, ugh. The only thing going for it was the spinach dip but even that came with small broken chips like they were from the bottom of the dortios bag. A sad disappointment. I got the 2 soup combo and there it is, 2 soups right in your plate, no divider and that awful pea barley should be kept far far away from your Sedona Tortilla Soup never mind your mouth. eek!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-9
Gloria S.,"West Hollywood, CA",7,26,,2.0,9/9/2008,"I'm not afraid to go to a CPK.  Hell, I used to go all the time when I lived in DC; loved the cobb salad and the marsala marinara pasta.  So much so that I never ordered anything else, which is a problem I have at most restaurants--I find something I love and never order anything else.  But I was feeling adventurous so I went out on a huge limb and ordered the regular chicken marsala pasta.  I know--whoa!  Huge difference! Well, in fact, there was.  It tasted like Lo Mein.  Bad Lo Mein.  (I may be Chinese, but I have pretty low standards for Lo Mein, so trust me--this was Bad.)  I might go back, definitely going back to my standards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-9
