Emily K.,"Louisville, KY",114,32,52,4.0,10/1/2017,"This was my second time visiting California pizza kitchen. The first time I had a margarita pizza and it was great. I wanted to be adventurous this time so I tried the California club pizza. It wasn't my favorite. There was no sauce and barely any cheese. It had way too many greens just sitting on top. There were huge slices of avocado just sitting on top. I think it could have been a lot better with some kinda of sauce, less greens and chunks of avocado instead of slices.   It wasn't a bad experience; I just wasn't a fan of the pizza I tried. I'm sure there are many things on the menu that I would like. Our waitress was friendly. The complimentary bread was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville
Jessica G.,"Louisville, KY",211,62,22,5.0,11/12/2017,Excellent service!!!!!!!  I came for the Veterans Day special and was served by Steven who was very kind and personable.  I ordered the Chicken alfredo dish and it was amazing!!!!!  I was also given complimentary bread with oil that I didn't expect.   I didn't have cash so i kept adding things such as spinach or extra sauce to get a balance.  I naturally only drink water so I didn't get a beverage.  Still there was no check to pay so STEVEN if you randomly get money from a stranger one day it's a tip that you were owed.  I made a good mental note of his name and face.  The chefs were very professional and i enjoyed sitting at the bar and seeing exactly how much precision and expertise they take in making their magic.  I watched someone who wasn't a chef or a server look over dishes as they came out and checked for accuracy.  I was very impressed!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville
Phil S.,"Mount Washington, KY",3,58,75,4.0,4/19/2017,Farmers market soup was very good with a nice squash base. Very fresh. Turkey and Brie sandwich was very good as well. I would have liked the Brie melted.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville
Angel G.,"Fort Knox, KY",6,41,22,5.0,3/20/2017,I'm not sure how I haven't come across this place any sooner! So happy to see that there is a CPK located in Louisville! The restaurant is nestled right next to Dicks Sporting Goods at Oxmore Mall. You can park right across from it and enter in through the outside.  The service was great and the food even better! We went with their classic BBQ Chicken Pizza and tried it with the wheat crust option. Awesome!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville
Yolanda B.,"Birmingham, AL",2,14,23,4.0,6/15/2017,"CPK is good, as usual. Nothing extravagant or a ""must-have"" however it's filling and certain foods are perfect for my tastebuds.  I ordered my usual spinach and artichoke (add chicken) thin crust pizza, roasted veggie salad, and a butter cake. I really like the roasted veggie salad and highly recommend it. If you're interested in adding almost 1000 calories to your consumption, try the warm butter cake. It's pretty good!  Overall, CPK is a quick and easy grab for food that you know will always taste the same...no matter where you go. It's still, in my opinion, a bit pricey for what we're receiving but I appreciate the hassle-free environment, sipping and chatting while waiting on my to-go order, and knowing that my food will be to my liking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville
Bev A.,"Asheville, NC",9,13,,5.0,6/22/2017,"I travel all the time and like to go to certain ""chain"" restaurants because of reliability and consistency. It doesn't always deliver but tonight it certainly did.  As is my pattern when eating alone, I eat and drink at the bar. Preston, the server/bartender was fantastic. Made sure everything was good, made every accommodation to my order and truly was a delight. Cedar plank salmon and shisito peppers were great. But as is often the case, service trumps and this was divine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville
Whitney B.,"Decatur, GA",59,18,12,4.0,5/21/2017,"My friend and I went for dinner after the Wheel of Fortune auditions. We were seated immediately even on a Saturday night which was great! Our server (I THINK her name was Ally. She had pink flowers on her name tag) was wonderful and attentive. She suggested cauliflower BBQ ""wings"" as an appetizer and came up with a dairy free sauce for me to use for dipping. I ordered the banh mi bowl and it was delicious and a HUGE portion. The flavors were competing with each other a bit, but overall it was lovely.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville

Lauren H.,"Louisville, KY",166,290,384,2.0,1/25/2016,"CPK is super ""blah"" to me. An overpriced chain restaurant that serves mediocre food. I was so disappointed that I wasted the calories and money on a meal here, but I've learned my lesson. We ended up here on a Saturday night after being quoted a wait time elsewhere. I tend to be impatient and usually don't wait for a seat at restaurants. Most important lesson learned: just wait. By the time you get to another restaurant, you could've already been seated at the first one.  CPK serves pizzas, pastas, and other specialties. The choices are pretty typical, and for a place with ""pizza"" in the name, there aren't many creative or unique options. I decided to go with a pizza with the hope that it would be decent since it's in their namesake. The pizzas are around $15 each for an individual size (11-12 inches), thin crust and baked in an open flame oven. I compare the size, thinness of crust, and cooking style to Blaze. The difference is Blaze is half the price, tastes infinitely better, and has unlimited toppings of your choice.  My pizza (pepperoni, sausage, mushroom) came out. The pizza looked good enough. The mushrooms were piled high, though the other toppings were pretty minimal. However, it didn't taste near as good as it looked. The toppings were not flavorful. The pizza was severely under-sauced. Just blah.  For me, CPK is a two star restaurant because of their overpriced, subpar food. Not a place I plan on frequenting again. There are way too many options for better pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville
Heather M.,"Louisville, KY",28,44,25,4.0,1/20/2017,This place is really good but its way too expensive.   We only come once a year because of the price.  I would recommend it if you are okay with spending about $50 for a pizza dinner but they do have more options yen pizza.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville
Dominic F.,"Memphis, TN",9,7,,5.0,8/7/2017,"The overall average rating of 3.5 stars for this restaurant is just not right. My wife and I ate there this evening and it was absolutely wonderful. I had a house salad with champagne vinaigrette dressing that was delicious. Also the zucchini with shrimp over fettuccine was very good, except I would've liked a little less lemon. But still delicious. She had a Cobb salad and it was excellent. All fresh with great grilled chicken. Pizzas at the other tables looked very good, too, and we'll have to go back to try one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville
Jennifer J.,"Louisville, KY",47,4,20,4.0,9/29/2016,"I really enjoy this restaurant. I think the atmosphere is good and the food tastes fresh and good. The service is fast and professional. My husband and I went to CPK for lunch today and enjoyed it.  I had the soup and salad lunch special (farmers market soup and Caesar salad with grilled shrimp). I love that soup! It has such and a good flavor, not too sweet. The Caesar salad is very good especially with the addition of the shrimp (not on the menu as a choice but they will always make that for me).  My husband got the pizza and soup lunch. He had the sausage mushroom pizza and the tortilla soup. Both good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville
Tweety S.,"Washington, DC",11,18,,5.0,5/19/2017,"As always CPK never disappoints. I ordered the delicious jambalaya and the butter cake.

Taryn M.,"Louisville, KY",195,132,49,4.0,12/16/2015,"I had lunch here with a girlfriend while finishing up some Christmas shopping and was very happy as I had wanted to try this spot for a while!  We both ordered salads and I have to say the small size is more than plenty, I can't imagine the regular size, it would surely be enough for two! My friend got the BBQ chicken salad and I the chopped. I opted to try with the beets, and although I am not much for beets usually, I was pleasantly surprised.  Good service and a nice atmosphere, I would definitely come here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville

Brad H.,"Louisville, KY",139,102,838,4.0,1/16/2016,While visiting the Apple Store and in-line for their usual 45 minutes to 60 minute wait I decided to go to California pizza kitchen for lunch. The restaurant was perhaps three quarters full and was not too noisy. I received quick service and was quickly served up an ice cold beer.  They had a number of lunch specials on the board however I settled for the Thai salad to go along with my absolutely freezing cold beer. The salad had chicken on it and was huge and delicious.  It's been years since I've been in the kitchen however  I'm going to be going back soon I think as it was a great experience. And I still got done in time to go back to the Apple Store and wait some more,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville
Emily H.,"Louisville, KY",3607,606,7182,4.0,1/27/2014,"While malls may be overflowing with boutiques, kiosks and department stores, food options can definitely lack, which is why I'm happy that Oxmoor Center has a California Pizza Kitchen.  On my most recent visit, CPK provided the affordable and better-than-food-court meal that my friend and I craved. We were immediately given a table upon entering the restaurant -- no wait required. The server was attentive and helpful.  We ended up splitting a Hawaiian pizza, which was ample for the two of us. Yet it didn't set us back much more than $7 each. My friend also got a salad, which was large enough to have been a meal in and of itself.  I often forget about CPK when I visit Oxmoor, but after a great recent visit, I hope I don't again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville
Craig U.,"Lexington, KY",148,309,858,4.0,1/9/2016,"So I recently watched a Cooking Network show about the History of Pizza.  It was interesting because it would seem that more of the untraditional pizza toppings actually originated at the California Pizza Kitchen (particularly BBQ chicken pizza).  I'm sure it was all very exciting, but the time has come when most of these pizzas are available elsewhere.  Does it still hold up? The decor was very modern, I believe remodeled from its original style.  Looking over the menu, the focus really seems to be off the pizza... But they have some very interesting and inventive other entrees... Anything from Kung Pao Spaghetti to Chicken Caesar Salad.  Lots of both traditional and fusion food combinations.  My wife and I decided to try their Ancho Chicken Pizza, with black beans, roasted corn, salsa, and chicken seasoned with ancho chiles.  Not as spicy as we expected, but very good regardless.  And very filling, surprisingly, for just a 10-inch pizza. The crust was pretty much perfect... Oven-fired, crisp, plenty of bite.  A little expensive for that small of a pizza at $13.49, but still a great experience. I will also say that the service there was EXCELLENT.  I never saw my glass approach even half-way being empty.  And I'm a heavy drinker (of sweet tea, that is).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville
phil m.,"Louisville, KY",12,52,,1.0,8/4/2014,"Went back to the California Pizza Kitchen while at the Oxmoor today. Arrived around 2:15 pm.

Katy W.,"Louisville, KY",32,22,3,5.0,8/18/2011,"Lemme tell you a story about what happens when I make plans to go to CPK: Around 8:30 am the morning of the visit, I start thinking about what I am going to order.  This is promptly followed by numerous visits to the website to look over the menu, which I should have memorized by now, but I like to pour over the ingredients and really assess what I am in the mood to eat.  Spicy? Greasy? Veggie? Asian? Even pizza at all?  There are so many options that it tends to stress me out if I don't come prepared.   So, I have what I want all picked out, and I've been thinking about it all day, mouth watering.  I usually go to CPK with my best friend, who shares my unhealthy obsession for the establishment.  We intently look over the menu one more time in order to ensure that are orders are vastly different from each other for sharing purposes.  Then the waiter arrives....""yes sir, I would like the Goat Cheese with Roasted Peppers pizza...no wait, the Jamaican Jerk pizza...no, no, definitely the Goat Cheese.  Wait! I didn't notice this before...how about the thin crust chicken pesto pizza?  No, I want to stick with what I know, definitely Goat Cheese.""  You can imagine how much the waiters hate us. No matter what you're in the mood for, CPK has it all and can satisfy any craving.  Just be sure to go prepared or else be prepared to seriously annoy your waiter!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville?start=40

G G.,"Maineville, OH",1,27,,2.0,11/11/2010,"This was my first, and probably last visit, to a CPK. Maybe I just didn't get it but to me this place was all atmosphere and below average food. First, there was no build your own pizza option. I know this is gourmet pizza but why can't you build your own gourmet pizza? The pizza we got was a big MEH. At $15 for a 10 inch I expect much more. Service was what you would expect from teenage waitresses working the weekend. The only thing that made me give 2 stars was the dessert. Some kind of hot butter cake with ice cream on top. Simple and delicious. It just plain rocked. Maybe I am spoiled living in Cincinnati where IMO Deweys does gourmet pizza 10 time better.

I like lemonades and here you can get, flavored with kiwi, mango and strawberries (there's probably another kind but these are the three i enjoyed sippin') I love spaghetti and the asian kung pao twist is really awesomely tasty!

I don't like malls.  I don't like chains.  What the heck am I doing giving 4 stars to a chain located in a mall? I can't help myself.  I was flying solo today and I truly appreciate a restaurant that can handle the table for one without making me feel like a social outcast. I was seated quickly, despite the fact that they were still in the middle of the lunch rush.  The server was prompt and attentive - I don't think I ever made it more than 2/3 of the way through my beverage before a new one appeared as if my magic.  He was ready to take my order the moment I had decided without having hovered.  He was friendly and cordial without bombarding me with pity conversation - I was able to read my book in peace.  Never once got the ""oh, you have no friends, how sad, could you chew more quickly so we can flip this table"" vibe that you occasionally get as a solo diner.

Yes.  Now, it's not one of those awesome hole-in-the-wall joints but it does deliver some great pies.   The service at the Oxmoor mall store is good.  The options are endless it seems - which usually is a bad thing but from what I hear most of their pies are good. Complaints:  The thin crust pies are not crispy.  Stick to the regular pies.  The apple crisp is too sweet.  Stick to the chocolate souffle.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville?start=40

I tried the thin crust Jamaican  Jerk Chicken (Jerk chicken, spicy sweet Caribbean sauce, Mozzarella, applewood smoked bacon, onions, bell peppers and scallions) and Habanero Carnitas (Slow-roasted pulled pork, red onions, cilantro pesto, Mozzarella and Queso Quesadilla cheese with spicy habanero salsa). Both were absolutely scrumptious, especially the Habanero Carnitas if you crave something spicy and a bit different from what you usually find at pizza places. They serve it with a habanero-based dipping sauce which is also wonderful! I'm just salivating while writing this review. I went back a couple of times and enjoyed the food and service each time.

The idea that I had to go there was made much better by the fact that we stopped by California Pizza Kitchen. There were many vegetarian options, which was great considering most pizza joints tend to just add more and more meat options for toppings. I ended up getting mushroom ravioli, and it was quite nice. Portions weren't so huge that I felt I was committing an act of gluttony. I can't stand chains, so this isn't a place I would make a regular habit of going to, as I love seeking out unique places.

I politely said no and he had his manager come over to ask if everything was alright. I just said that I wasn't crazy about the pizza and the manager insisted that I choose another menu item.

They always offer consistent quality with their dishes so when you order, you know you won't be disappointed. I have never ordered something that I didn't love. This place has a very unique and eclectic menu and it always hits the spot. The only down side to CPK is your experience totally depends on the server and service is completely hit and miss. You may have to wait 10 minutes for a refill depending on who your server is. The last time we were there my wife didn't finish her dinner because she planned to have desert. Not only did the server NOT offer us desert, he didn't say a word as he did a fly by drop off of our check. They missed out on sales, (I wanted a beverage from the bar for desert) and disappointed us. The other negative side of CPK is the noise level can get pretty loud. I have often wondered why they haven't installed noise reduction panels. It sounds like a soup kitchen during dinner rush!

Samantha D.,"Prospect, KY",65,100,117,5.0,11/29/2014,For me to give a 5 star review means I was very impressed. Came for lunch at around 1pm on a Saturday and was pleasantly surprised to find no lines or waiting time even though the restaurant was full. I ordered a mango lemonade which was AMAZING and a California Club pizza. I also got some bread and loved it. Service was great and speedy. Prices are a bit high but you do get a large pizza for what you pay. Definitely recommend it and will come back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville?start=20
Alessandra D.,"Louisville, KY",64,94,527,5.0,11/12/2015,"I love CPK and its friendly staff! This is one of the few restaurants that I can order the same thing every time I go and it never lets me down. The Thai crunch chicken salad is probably my favorite salads anywhere and although people normally come here for the pizza, I make sure I always get this salad too. The half size portion is enough for two people and they give you the option to add avocado for two extra dollars and believe me, you must add it to this already delicious salad. Moving on to the pizza-- they have thick and thin crusts and a variety of kinds of pizza to choose from that are plenty enough to feed two. I normally get the 'Works' (which has a ton of meats) or the 'California Club' (which is the pizza version of the thai chicken salad) but if you want plain ol' pepperoni, it is delicious too. Finally, if you are thinking about drinking water or Coca-Cola, don't! You need to try one of their flavored lemonades (which include free refills btw), my favorites are the Strawberry and Mango lemonade as they are very refreshing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville?start=20
Mike A.,"Louisville, KY",228,223,2009,4.0,5/21/2014,This is my 9 year olds absolute favorite restaurant in the whole wide world. She says there is no better macaroni around! Crayons are always provided. pizza choices are great.  My favorites non pizza choices are the Cobb salad and pork tacos. If you are in the mood for a cocktail the drinks are top notch with honest pours. They also have curbside takeout available if you are on the go.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville?start=20
Trevor W.,"Wiesbaden, Germany",13,98,135,3.0,10/11/2014,"CPK is pretty much the same as I remember it.  Unfortunately for us we came after a ""Race for the Cure"" event, which is an awesome cause.   But unfortunately it meant  half the restaurant was wearing workout suits and it smelled of sweat. Needless to say that was not so appetizing but other than that it was your normal CPK experience.  Sicilian Thin Crust Pizza we good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville?start=20
mill b.,"Gardena, CA",0,20,,5.0,12/27/2015,"The appetizer, ginger chicken wontons, was delicious. It wasn't a tailgater pre-meal, not the gargantuan McThis or O'That appetizer meant to be split between 4 hearty overeaters, but a delicately portioned and presented pre-meal teaser. Many won't like that, but we appreciated that the appetizer, split between the two of us, left room for the pizza when it arrived. We really came for the pizza, and it didn't disappoint. The thin crust was very well made: pastry-like and crispy, flavorful in itself. The toppings merged reasonably, the sauce, cheese and ingredients. It was PIZZA pizza. Light, but not a handful of uncooked ingredients on a wafer. As to other factors in the experience, the waiter was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. When we asked to build our own pizza topping -- which manifestly is not the format of this place -- without missing a beat, he helped us work out a custom pizza by finding an existing pizza with most the toppings we wanted, and adding an extra topping. He was unflappable and never lapsed into the ""these pests"" eye-roll you will experience in many restaurants. We weren't being difficult. But we know we did step just off the path. That the server remained friendly and accommodating speaks volumes (good) about CPK. We will return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville?start=20
Lane L.,"Jackson, TN",5,25,5,4.0,8/14/2015,"I love the Waldorf Chicken Salad. I change it up a little bit by adding sweet corn and getting mozzarella instead of the Gorgonzola. It really is legit. Not 5 stars on the price though. A full salad is $14 which confuses me bc field greens aren't very expensive in general, CPK. Nevertheless it doesn't deter me from ordering this over and over agin.  Flat breads are decent and so is the pizza. Although it's a bit too fancy for my taste.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville?start=20
Sherri W.,"Naples, FL",3,2,,1.0,10/19/2015,"I arrived with my granddaughter at 5:45 pm. One person walked in ahead of us and was seated immediately. She said to us it would be 5-15 minutes, but there were plenty of empty tables. I said You're kidding and she dismissed us with, ""well have a nice day"". So there was no way we were going to stay there. Please, train your hostesses to be welcoming and not offensive.

Kellyo O.,"Prospect, KY",201,512,1136,5.0,10/1/2012,"I know it says pizza but I habe been getting salads here lately and I love them! Every one I have tried I have liked. they even swapped out a salad once because they were not clear on the way an ingredient was prepared so they just offerd me a different one. I do love their pizzas as well and love the variety.  Also, they are very hospitable to groups. I have taken a Girl Scout troop there and another group to learn how to make pizza. Great business model.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville?start=20
Jason M.,"Louisville, KY",67,133,216,5.0,11/21/2013,"We have been here countless times.  Never gets old.  Never a bad experience. The fish tacos are so good I nearly slapped a stranger in the parking lot when I left.  An extra dollar for avocado is a little much, but hey, it tasted good.  Most recently my wife and I split a small pizza.  It was thin crust amazingness we couldn't shove into our faces quick enough.  That was actually the first time I had ordered pizza from there and felt like I had been missing out all this time.  But hey, the fish tacos are really that good.   Our girls like their mac n' cheese and were nice enough to let me try it, so I see why they love coming here.  The kids menu is actually pretty good and our girls have never had any issues with eating anything here.  A bonus for us parents. For a family of four, this isn't a place to go when we want something cheap, but the food is always worth it.  Nice that it is located in the mall because we can walk around after (or waddle depending on the amount of food).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville?start=20
Andrea K.,"Mount Washington, KY",3,19,11,4.0,7/4/2015,I think they have the best gluten free pizza I've tried thus far!  Very friendly staff and great atmosphere!  They were very accommodating with my gluten sensitivity.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville?start=20
Madrid S.,"La Grange, KY",0,14,12,1.0,7/3/2015,"We're so sad that this California Pizza Kitchen has changed so much. The pasta was undercooked, bland and had almost no chicken. The California Club sandwich came without the avocado it was supposed to have but did come dripping with mayonnaise, just gross.  We asked to speak with the manager and she tried to tell us maybe we were not used to the way they do things there. Since the waiter knew my husband by name that blew that theory. She would only take 20% off the bill so we told her we probably wouldn't be back. She said and I quote,  okay thanks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville?start=20
Scarlett S.,"Edina, MO",0,19,4,4.0,4/26/2015,"I typically do not give chains more than three stars since the food is usually not up to my standard. This location is going to be the exception. The food was delicious; typical California Pizza Kitchen grub. What made this location stand out? The customer service. From the host to our waitress to the server who brought our meal, everyone was friendly and attentive. Exactly how wait staff should be. Extremely impressed and will return when we are in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville?start=20

Mark B.,"Louisville, KY",2,14,6,5.0,1/14/2015,Always love coming here for any meal of the day but the best thing on the menu is the avocado egg rolls even though they are the only things fried on the menu!

Adam C.,"Louisville, KY",84,440,,4.0,7/7/2013,"I try to eat at local places as much as possible,but when I want a really good pizza CPK always delivers. BBQ or Hawaiian BBQ are great, thai chicken was just ok. Focaccia is a great app as well as mac n cheese. Margherita  pizza was best I have ever had, and I try them everywhere to compare it to CPK. Nice place to go for lunch or after a trip to the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville?start=20
