Jeev D.,"Cleveland Heights, OH",25,36,313,4.0,5/2/2015,"I normally would not write a review for this restaurant but my family received such good service i thought i should post it.  Food wise this place is still a 3  .... but the service we received was a 5.    Yesterday, my family and i went there around noon.  It was busy, like normal.  The food was average at best.  Except for the hummus, which was quite good.  Our server, Tim was on his game.   It was obvious he has worked in the industry for a while.  He was friendly, fast and efficient.  He didn't miss a beat, even when a drink was spilled----that's what happens when kids are involved.   The service was impeccable.  We eat at a lot of ""high end"" restaurants and the service  is always good but this  was hands down the best we have seen in years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lyndhurst?start=20

Ordered the fish tacos twice, did not like it either times. Also, I have to say, their drinks are bad every time I tried it.

Arun M.,"Coralville, IA",36,340,11,3.0,7/22/2013,"I decided to go to CPK just because I have passed it so many times and wanted to try it out. Also one of my friends misses it a lot! We were there for lunch at 3 PM and it was mostly quiet. Most customers here were drinking beer and food was the second thing on their mind. I think that kind of took over the waiters too. They were quite slow. We were sitting outside and it took them 15 minutes to get water for us. The food arrived with some delay also.  I would be lying if I say I did not like their food. Food was good, but it had that character to it, which is usually found in a chain restaurant. We ordered California veggie pizza, all the ingredients were fresh and delicious. The Mediterranean Focaccia was good. I would have loved to see some more character to their food. At the end we had a feeling that there was nothing special in the food or experience. We were glad that our check was not more than what it would have been for a large pizza from Papa John's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lyndhurst?start=20

Our waiter wasn't the most friendly lady and kept wanting to take plates away from our table. Whatever. The pizza was good we got chipotle chicken. The lime cream sauce was a little watery compared to usual, tasted the same tho. We also got a app which was corn chips with white corn avocado, I don't recommend that.

The salad menu is quite creative. I got the Moroccan Spiced Chicken Salad. It had a complex mix of items in it: butternut squash, dates, avocado, almonds, beets, red peppers, chopped egg and cranberries. I don't usually like beets, but they blended perfectly into this salad. The waitress was efficient and quickly took our order right after brining out our waters as she noticed our menus were closed. Another person brought out the food, but she was back to check on us about 5 minutes later. She cleared the dishes quickly too, but then disappeared so there was a brief wait for our checks.

K L.,"North Ridgeville, OH",8,17,16,4.0,1/19/2012,"I go to CPK quite often, because I simply love their food! SERVICE: varies from good to bad Their service here seems to vary from terrible, crap service to good service on every visit.  Even when I came on a Tuesday afternoon when the restaurant wasn't at all busy, I received bad service.  That day, we were promptly seated and ordered immediately, but waited a whole hour for our two (simple) dishes: Garlic Cream Fettuccine. We called another server over and told her that we ordered an hour ago and our waitress was MIA.  Turns out, the waitress didn't put in our orders and totally forgot about us,  The manager did come by and our meals were on the house so that made up for the bad waitress's mistake. At that point, I decided to order their Tuscan Hummus appetizer to-go since my meal was free.  The waitress forgot to bring that out to me, too. -_- And this isn't even my worst experience from CPK! To be fair, most of my visits were decent or good service-wise.  - They don't take reservations on the weekend (inconvenient since they're really busy during the weekends!) FOOD: DELICIOUS! Tuscan hummus appetizer (Photo included) I love hummus and their hummus appetizer is one of the best hummus dishes I've ever had!  The pita bread is soooo soft and the hummus is topped off with tomatoes, basil, parsley, and garlic. I ALWAYS lick the plate clean. I highly recommend this appetizer.  Mediterranean Plate (Small cravings) The small cravings section of the menu lists appetizer dishes for one person so their portions are quite small - just enough for one person like it implies. The overall taste is good and I would order it again. Chipotle Chicken Pizza (Photo included) VERY spicy, but omg tastes amazing! I don't even like spicy food, but I absolutely love this pizza. I tried it on a whim since my boyfriend ordered it and now I can't get enough of it. The size of the pizza is on the smaller size, but for the taste, it is worth every penny. I highly recommend this pizza, but I'd like to warn you that you might become completely addicted to it like me. lol  Garlic Cream Fettuccine ($10) Simple, but great pasta dish! I order the fettuccine on 80% of my visits to CPK.  I crave it often because it's just so tasty.  The prominent flavor comes from the garlic.  It's a pleasant dish to eat - not bursting with flavors, yet still very satisfying. Baby Clam Linguine w/ Lemon Cream Sauce  A little bit on the spicy side - this dish tastes very yummy overall. They weren't cheap about the amount of baby clams they put in the dish, which I was very happy with. Portions are pretty good! Pineapple Pina Colada (non-alcoholic) Their pina coladas comes without alcohol regularly, but you can ask them to put rum in it. Although it's a little expensive ($4.50), it's well-worth it.  The pina colada is presented beautifully in a somewhat large glass.  Instead of the usual slushie-type drink, CPK's version is much creamier. I'm addicted to it as I'm a huge fan of pina coladas - especially CPK's pina coladas.  (Photo included) Raspberry Mango Pina colada (non-alcoholic) I was really wowed at how beautiful this drink looked (Photo included). It tastes amazing! I could drink this everyday... ATMOSPHERE - clean restaurant and restrooms - tweens frequently come here - on the weekends, CPK is usually busy so noise level is high - CPK seems like a family restaurant so it's not a very romantic place for dates, but Legacy Village is usually very nicely decorated and couples take a stroll around the balcony area or fountain often. After dining at CPK, couples can take a stroll around these areas. - Good location: Legacy Village has many stores and as mentioned before, it's nicely decorated with a fountain and balcony area, which are good hang-out places. There's also beachwood mall a little further down Cedar. I can't wait to come back here! :D",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lyndhurst?start=20

One strike - we ordered the white corn guacamole small plate, and the salsa that came out looked suspiciously unlike the picture on the menu.  It turned out that it was missing red peppers, and when we inquired about this we were informed that the restaurant had run out of red peppers for the day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lyndhurst?start=20

Michele G.,"Cleveland, OH",12,24,31,4.0,8/25/2008,"California Pizza Kitchen is a solid chain restaurant when you're looking for good pizza at a reasonable price and in a laid-back environment. Kid-friendly and their outdoor seating is nice - overlooking the courtyard at Legacy Village, which makes for great people-watching during dinner. During the summer - usually Friday nights - various bands perform in the courtyard area, so if you're lucky to snag a seat outside, you get to hear live music, too.  Pizza is quite tasty. The California Club is our favorite - shredded romaine lightly tossed in mayo, topped with apple-smoked bacon, sliced roma tomatoes and avocado. Also like the sesame ginger dumplings filled with chicken and served with this awesome soy-ginger chili sauce. I love the sauce so much, I found myself dipping the bread they give into the sauce to savor every last drop! I don't know how they do it - each time we get those wontons, they're steamed so perfectly and so soft. (of course, took pics of the food) The Legacy location offers Curbside Service. It's set up to be a convenient service - just call ahead and place your order (tell them if you'll be paying cash or credit) and let them know what kind of car you drive (this is the perfect time to tell them that you can be found in the yellow Ferarri), then make your way to one of their designated Curbside Pickup parking spots (at Legacy, they're located outside Stir Crazy - you'll see a camera on top of the building). We've tried this service twice now, even arriving slightly after the time they told us and both times we've waited over 10 minutes for them to come out with our food. Seems to sort of defeat the convenience of the service, knowing that it would only take me a few minutes to run in, pay and pick up my order. So, we may not try this again. I would say it might be convenient if you had kids, but the last time we noticed a woman in the car next to us, two small kids in the backseat, frustrated and clearly calling CPK to find out where her order was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lyndhurst?start=60
Joseph F.,"Cleveland, OH",144,157,,4.0,5/1/2008,"Man, I really want to give this place five stars. No matter how hard I try, though, I just can't. Why not?

Oh sure, I could order a salad or something else to supplement, but then it starts getting expensive, and if I'm going to pay a lot, I might as well go someplace nicer! Seriously...I LOVE the pizza here. If this place ever went the Cici's route and had a pizza buffet, I would go here eight days a week. There are so many varieties and I always agonize over which one to pick. While I never am disappointed by the pizza I pick, though, I wind up wishing I had ordered something else to supplement my meal.

Patrick B.,"Hudson, OH",47,238,,5.0,7/26/2007,"California Pizza Kitchen is a restaurant in which I've never had a bad experience at. This location, in Legacy Village, is the only location in Greater Cleveland. The restaurant itself is very expansive, with a few tables outside facing the green and a modern bar in which you can dine at and watch the food being cook, as the kitchen is fully visible. If you only have up to three people with you, even kids, I recommend the counter, as you get the same service, again, kid friendly, and you don't have to wait unless the bar is full. There is often a wait for a table, as this is one of Legacy Village's most popular restaurants. The food is outstanding. You are given complimentary bread and butter as you wait for your food. You can select from soup, salad, pizza, pasta, sandwiches, and a few specialties. The appetizers are great too. The most recent time I was there I had the Cajun pizza. It was excellent. It was spicy, but not too spicy, as the spicy andouille sausage was complemented by the sweet bell peppers, as well as the onions. Their crust is outstanding. It alone is worth the drive. Overall, if you're looking to go somewhere laid back and fun, head over to CPK, no matter where you are in the Cleveland area.

The host helped me get the baby carrier in the booth and settled.  Our server came over and got our waters right away and helped recommend an adult beverage right away. She told me about the plum martini, so I decided to try it out. It was amazing!!! I'm usually disappointed when I go with a recommendation, but not this time. I only wish that my glass was a little fuller. It wasn't as full as it should have been. I ordered the BBQ chopped chicken salad. I ordered the half size. The salad came out promptly and looked tasty. The half size was huge. I added avocados to my salad. The salad had fresh lettuce and the BBQ chicken was tasty. The avocados were fresh too!

N L.,"Cleveland Heights, OH",0,10,,1.0,7/11/2013,"1. Our Server Rob was absolutely fantastic. His command of both his job and the authoritative command he demonstrated was admirable. Even after a sarcastic and frustrated quip by me, he still kept his cool. Under no circumstance do I blame my server for what happened. He was doing his job. It was his manager that was flatly deplorable. I would very much appreciate my money back. The story follows below. 2. This visit, my last, has unequivocally turned me off to 'CPK' for the rest of my life. Under no circumstances would I ever consider visiting another 'CPK' again -- at any location. Sadly, my girlfriend used to like this place, now she despises it. Upon ordering a poorly seasoned macaroni bite plate by my girlfriend, she asked our server for some marinera sauce to give it some more flavor to cut through the breaded and fried mess. He states that there was a $1.00 charge for the add on, and that the kitchen would ""saute"" some for us and he'd have it right up. Sitting at the bar, we watched as the open kitchen poured some from a plastic bag into the container, and then ladled an overly generous amount in to a dish. We then watched as one of the line cooks -- in full view -- put the dish into the microwave. The manager then served us the nuked tomato sauce and I politely, but succinctly, asked him why the sauce was put into the microwave, after we had been previously informed that the sauce would have been warmed in the pan. Yes, it tastes differently and would have been worth $1 had it been warmed in-house, and dare I say it I hoped would be made in-house, however it would have been fine if he just would have comped it -- even though admittedly I should have asked to comp the bites themselves.  The problem came when the manager decided to respond in a flippant manner. Not only did he drop the ball on quickly fixing the problem but yelled at both me and my girlfriend telling us that ""all add-ons cost $1"" and that ""...if we'd like it in a pan he could have it made for us in a pan."" I tired to reason with him as to why I was not going to pay for it. He continued to raise his voice, and rudely slammed the dish down when, exasperated, I asked him to just take it back. His sarcastic lack any sort of sophistication, his inability to rectify the situation, his disrespectful tone he took with my girlfriend -- a young woman whose job is to work with severely autistic girls as a teacher -- and the overall pathetic vibe I felt from the 'CPK' he managed ensures I'll, we'll, never return.

Matthew M.,"Cleveland, OH",177,208,174,3.0,7/1/2010,"CPK Children, Pizza, Koontz This seems to be the choice hang-out for the family oriented diner of Legacy Village. Family and kid friendly, this place can get pretty boisterous and disorderly on a busy night. Bring your patience, your pills and ear plugs.  I've been to this locale plenty of times in the past, with the most recent trip last night to meet up with my Mum.  We sat on the patio which overlooked the courtyard and Bar Louie. Alfresco dining at it's finest. In the summer, the courtyard/stage area offers movies and live music. A pretty nice amenity if you can survive without having your wallet drained by the surrounding upper class retail outlets. Last night, ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" was playing. Needless to say, kiddy enthusiasm filled the air.  As for the menu, it's practically endless in options. Countless pizza creations, sandwiches, soups, salads, pastas and more. The menu is like a Dean Koontz novel. No one ever finishes reading it in it's entirety because it's just too damn long.  I opted for the Greek Pizza. For some strange reason, I've been in a Greek Rut lately. The last 4 meals I've had out to eat have all been Greek Pizza's. The last movie I saw at the theater was ""Getting Him to the Greek"" and I've been unexplainably spraying Windex on everything, hoping to somehow remedy all of my non-disabling ailments. I can't explain my psychosis. I am a very disturbed individual.   The pizza was ok, but probably my least favorite Greek pie in the last four attempts. I do like the dough though.

Julie D.,"Wilmington, NC",380,1200,1382,3.0,2/15/2009,"I love CPK and have even gone out of my way to visit.  I will not be going out of my way to visit this location.  It's located in Legacy Village and it's basically the McDonald's of the shopping center.  We went on a Saturday evening, the place was jammed packed with kids, kids, and more kids.  Noisy, loud, whiney kids. Food is good, we shared the Singapore shrimp rolls appetizer.  Yummy shrimp, baby broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, noodles, bean sprouts, green onion and cilantro wrapped in rice paper. They were served chilled with a nice ginger sauce.  Dinner was my favorite, barbeque chicken pizza with fresh yummy pineapple.  Service was great, but really the noise detracted from the meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lyndhurst?start=40
Patrick P.,"Columbus, OH",0,1,,4.0,6/2/2014,Great service and the food was good.  Liked that they had valet parking cause the wether was horrible.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lyndhurst?start=40
Sanghita B.,"Madison, NJ",0,133,23,3.0,11/27/2011,Liked the appetizers better than the Pizza. A little overrated. Quite expensive for the portion size.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lyndhurst?start=40
Kerri M.,"Johnstown, PA",3,146,,4.0,8/8/2011,I did takeout and ordered the half portion BBQ Chicken Salad and Thai Chicken Tortilla Rolls all very good.  I love the CPK menu and like the atmosphere.  Their food and service has always been a good experience.  This location was a little hard to find if you are not familiar with the Legacy Village.  It is more in the middle of the Village instead of the outskirts.  But they have curbside parking.  I'm not sure where that is in the Village since I parked right outside their restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lyndhurst?start=40
Rick W.,"Avon, OH",30,260,9,4.0,2/19/2011,"Favorite is Thai crunch salad and chipotle chicken pizza is the best.  The Korean BBQ tacos are ok, needed a little bit more spiciness with the slaw topper.

Alicia M.,"Mentor, OH",4,84,8,5.0,1/11/2011,"CPK is hands down one of my favorite, go to restaurants for delicious, fresh and inventive salads. I have tried every single salad on the menu and can say with absolute certainty, each one is delightful and bursting with flavor. I am not usually one to frequent chain restaurants however I seem to make a weekly trip to CPK either for dine-in or carryout. The Moroccan Chicken Salad is my stand-by favorite and I usually get the Asparagus Soup as an appetizer which surprisingly has no cream but is still rich and velvety. The pizzas are very tasty as well, the BLT and pear and gorgonzola are among my favorites. The only slight downfall is that every time I dine in, it always seem as though there is at least one  screaming kid in the place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lyndhurst?start=40
Linas M.,"Beachwood, OH",365,10,3,5.0,5/27/2011,"This is probably my all around favorite restaurant!  Their Thai Crunch Salad with peanut sauce is the best salad I have ever had!  Lots of other great dishes, and I almost hardly ever get pizza there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lyndhurst?start=40
Koa H.,"Lakewood, OH",25,90,10,4.0,11/18/2017,"Oh CPK! The flavors and the staple chopped salad hold up in this far from C location, but I have to deduct one star for the run down environs at this location. Most would probably not notice but in my experience, CPK usually takes it a step higher. Food was still great though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lyndhurst
Ashley M.,"Cleveland, OH",236,349,782,4.0,6/10/2017,Had an early dinner last night and I was pleasantly surprised by this place. It isn't your typical pizza joint.  The salad I ordered was delicous. I really enjoyed the fresh apples and candied walnuts. Plus the dressing was fantastic. I believe it was called the waldorf!  My husband ordered a pizza that was spicy and sweet. I had a piece that was cold later that evening and it was great! The crust was nice and thin. Our server was Sam. He was pretty awesome! It wasn't crazy busy anx the restaurant was clean and the drinks were fresh.  I'll definitely be back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lyndhurst
Bridget B.,"Cleveland, OH",110,70,79,4.0,4/13/2017,"Get the butter cake. I crave CPK's butter cake more often that I would like to admit.  In terms of starters, I love their brussel sprout flatbread! When I order an entree I almost always get their Chinese Chicken Salad. This salad is the first salad I've ever had that made me say ""wow, that's a good salad!"". I rarely do salad for dinner but their Chinese Chicken Salad is so good that I end up ordering it again and again. But for me, the real reason to go to California Pizza Kitchen is the butter cake. I never would have ordered it from the menu description unless the manager had not, himself, highly recommended that I try it. It is SO good. Out of this world delicious!  Aside from the food, I have always had excellent service at this CPK. The wait staff is always attentive and friendly. I would recommend going here (and definitely getting the butter cake) if you're in Legacy shopping. You are also able to order online and pick it up if that's more your style!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lyndhurst
Kaleigh L.,"Cleveland, OH",453,103,111,3.0,3/21/2017,"If you are in need of a spot to dine at, located across from Bar Loui, this is a good spot, most of the time. From lettuce wraps to unique and traditional pizzas, it can be found for you! Service and ambiance are average, a more modern version of your typical pizza shop. The garlic and chicken pizza is one to be reckon with though, don't be afraid to step outside of your comfort zone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lyndhurst
Hope L.,"Cleveland, OH",58,4,11,4.0,3/1/2017,"My Star Rating Scale:  1- I will never ever return! 2- Okay, Meh. 3- Good, but my mom's is better. (lol) 4- Amazing Experience, will be back! 5- I am blown away, Bravo!  Service: 5/5 Food: 4/5 Price: 4/5 Menu: 5/5 Location: 5/5 Wifi: 5/5 Atmosphere: 5/5 - Family friendly. Theme: Modern Pizza Kitchen Overall: 4.5! Breakdown: So we were seated fast. I had a sangria drink that was okay, nothing too special. This place is a modern pizza kitchen and the menu is decent. They offer plates that are not pizza related. The choices for apps could be better. I ordered the buffalo cauliflower app, a mushroom, pep, and sausage pizza, and the garlic chicken and seasonal veggies. ALL GOOD!! As far as the cauliflower, I make better at home, but I like theirs because it was lighter served on top on blue cheese and green onion!! Their pizza crust is light.. I love the freshly sliced ingredients. Much better than Pizza chains! The Garlic chicken was GREAT!! It is high in cals and sodium, so watch that. I love that the same effort is put into anything you order. I had plenty food to take home and share with my sister who loved it all as well! I was served by an older gentleman who was very nice. Final Thoughts: I have never had a bad plate from this kitchen. It's a mod pizza kitchen and it stands on its own. They do offer take out/pick up! Next time you want to go out for pizza, give them a try. The Pizzas are a little bigger than personal sizes, but they are thinner!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lyndhurst

Quinn our server was outstanding and made sure both my husband and I had great drinks and he kept the kids happy with endless chips and Parmesan for their pastas !

Sandasia L.,"Willoughby, OH",0,13,6,3.0,11/15/2017,"I ordered food to go from this restaurant. My husband got the short ribs over Mac n Cheese and I got the roasted veggie salad *with blackened salmon added*. Out of habit I checked the bag and realized that my husband's food was missing. She realized the mistake and gave me his food out of the warmer. We left and when we got home I noticed that they did not add the salmon. Now, I would not have left my house if it wasn't for the fact that the salmon was +$6 added to the $16 salad. I called and they told me to call when I got outside and they would bring it out. I called and the woman stated ""I will be out in one minute"". I waited about 7 minutes and just went in. The +$6 salmon was literally about 5 small pieces of salmon. I requested to speak to the manager bc that was robbery! He stated ""This is what you get for $6? Wow!"" Which was questionable bc you are a manager, you should know. Nonetheless, they were kind enough to take the salad and salmon off of my bill all together which I appreciated. I still took off two stars bc the food was not worth $44.
