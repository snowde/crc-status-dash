Shelly A.,"Saugus, MA",16,89,,3.0,12/4/2016,"Atmosphere was nice, pizza was pretty good but overpriced and a little burnt and the sangria was great. I would try it again but maybe branch out from the pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
Lauratu B.,"North Reading, MA",0,5,1,4.0,1/31/2017,Not really into pizza so I only went here because hubs is  into the it so I tagged along. The restaurant itself isn't too shabby however it's an open floor concept so it can get pretty loud. The servers were all very nice. The one we got was a bartender so she made me a Moscow mule which was pretty amazing. She also recommended the lemon/lime pasta which was delicious. My husband got the Bolognese pasta which was okay. Wasn't really seasoned well but what do you expect from a tomato pasta? No points off on it though. We also got the ice cream and cake and key lime pie for dessert which was also pretty good. No surprise there in terms of taste. This place was overall pretty good if you're looking for a laid back spot that won't break bank with good vibes.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
Armando V.,"Stoneham, MA",0,9,,4.0,8/5/2016,"Haven't been to a CPK in years and it's nice to see a new location that's local and not in busy Boston. Servers all seem very friendly and kind, espexially our server Chloe; she was awesome. The water was served right away and the complimentary bread works well. The pizza is cheap for the location and the fine atmosphere, it was served hot however it did take a while for it to come out. Overall a very good pizza place, very nice, id say dress nice to this location and don't expect to spend too much money if youre looking to get a pizza. The pizza size may be small but it's very filling and hey, ice cream and candies are all around Market Street!  8.5/10",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
Janet L.,"Melrose, MA",0,4,,1.0,4/19/2017,"My husband and I ate here last night. We were there to dine not drink but were  seated in the bar area.  The bartender was our waiter. He was nice but was busy visiting with other customers and making drinks. We asked for bread a few times and were told, ""I will bring it when it's ready"". Well, we never got bread.  Our pizza was very good.  I wanted a small side salad but didn't see one on the menu.  The service was very lacking and we left disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
Dan F.,"Haverhill, MA",37,13,7,1.0,8/6/2016,"I should have known when they couldn't put Olympics on the TV, that we should have left. At one point 6 staff were talking on back side of bar for a good 5 minutes. Then when it started to get busy they ignored customers and started prepping sangria mix. Our sangria ran dry and the bar maid took the empty glass and didn't offer a second. Then 10 minutes later another finally noticed our two empty drinks. We decided that if our order didn't come before finishing second drink that we would leave- our cold pizza arrived to the opposite side of the bar until they found us. Generally always give everyone a second chance, but really felt like we were a burden on our wait staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
Tom P.,"Haverhill, MA",1,19,1,5.0,7/25/2016,"CPK is an awesome new location for Market Street! I went on the preview weekend and was blown away by everything from the food, to the drinks, to the staff.

Miranda M.,"Waltham, MA",120,2,,4.0,8/1/2016,"My boyfriend and I went here for the first time yesterday and had a great dinner. The servers were all very attentive, as this location just opened a couple days ago. We redeemed a coupon for a free small plate through the rewards app and chose the chips and guac, which was DELICIOUS- the guacamole/corn thing they had was very good! Will definitely go with that again. We each got pizzas (I got the 5-cheese and tomato, while my boyfriend got the works), but if we go there again we would probably just get one pizza to split- I ended up having some of mine leftover. The location looked very clean and trendy. There were some little mistakes (not enough drink menus so we didn't get one initially and then had to share, not knowing how to process the free small plate reward at first, messing up our check) but the staff dealt with all of the mistakes with grace and efficiency. I think most of these things can be attributed to how new the restaurant/staff is. We overheard some issues with other tables (food coming out at different times to the same table, plates being dropped, etc.) but again, this is a new location.  One critique for the chain in general- why is the menu lacking in the beer department? Very few beers available other than your typical Bud Light/Sam Adams/Blue Moon etc. I don't think you have to go crazy with it, but when I order a pizza, I generally want a beer, not wine or sangria. (My boyfriend and I got wine and sangria, respectively, and agreed that while the drinks were good, they didn't pair as well with the pizza) Overall, a good start with a few hiccups at this new location. We'll be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
Olivia G.,"Whitney Point, NY",6,7,,5.0,7/26/2016,"Love this place! Anyone who is a regular at Market Street should make this a regular stop. For people that aren't new to Market Street, it's worth the trip and a great way to start or end a day of shopping. I am one of the pickiest eaters on the planet but am excited to try tons of new things here because the items I have tried so far have been delicious. The management is wonderful and accommodating. My boyfriend has a nut allergy that they were more than willing to pay close attention to while not making him feel like he was a pest. Highly recommend this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
Kerri C.,"Wakefield, MA",0,4,,5.0,10/23/2016,"I am so glad this restaurant opened near home. Our son has celiac disease and it is one of the only places he can go and not get sick. He LOVES the pizza and our servers have always been wonderful and accommodating. Even giving my toddler things to snack on while we waited for our food. I also think they're regular pizza is great and they allow call ahead seating , which is awesome with 3 little kids!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
Michael K.,"Boston, MA",0,42,1,1.0,8/15/2016,"We have visited this restaurant a few times since they opened last month.  At first we were very excited because the menu offers a variety of California inspired items for every palate.  Our first visit didn't go so well and we figured it was because the servers were just learning the ins and outs of the restaurant themselves and we understood that. The second time we visited a week later, the service was still not up to par with our expectations.  In both instances, it took a while to receive our beverages and to actually place our orders.  Our entrees also came out lukewarm which may be because the restaurant was so cold due to the air conditioning.   This past weekend, we ordered again from this restaurant but instead of dining in chose to order food for takeout and eat at home.  It was a huge mistake!!! Both of our items were not properly made and the chefs didn't follow any of the customizations that we had requested.  After 3 visits to this restaurant and walking away with ill feelings, we will never be back.  It's a shame because this restaurant really could have been a place to visit frequently.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
Lauren B.,"Wilmington, MA",0,2,,1.0,4/21/2017,"They cannot get an order correct.  Out of my last 5 experiences there, they have screwed up the order 4 times.  Service is always mediocre. I finally got frustrated enough to email customer service and shockingly enough - no response.  Obviously they have some extremely poor management at this particular location.  Too bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
Tony G.,"Lynnfield, MA",0,3,,1.0,12/26/2016,"Horrible horrible, cant believe I have to leave a star! I had a call ahead res, arrived to a half full dining room, with the entire staff running around, and no hostess. waited a good 10 minutes, only to be greeted with a ""15 minute wait"". When I asked why I couldnt just sit anywhere that was open, which was plenty, I was told there were no servers to attend to my table. Walked out, only hope CPK gets it right and shuts down this location, they are to good of a chain to let Lynnfield drag them down",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
Sharrun N.,"Wakefield, MA",0,33,,2.0,8/5/2016,"My daughter brought a large group to this location for her birthday tonight. She called in advance on Monday and three times tonight and spoke with different women who said coming at 6:30 would be fine and there would be a table ready for them.  When they got there at 6:32, they were told by a male manager that they were 20 minutes late and their table had been given away. He insisted the call ahead time was for 6:15, although she never spoke with him. No apology. No suggesting a way to accommodate them other than making them wait 45 minutes.  We have both worked in restaurants and go with the philosophy that the customer is always right. At the very least, the customer is not flat out told that they are wrong. Once they were seated, the wait staff and food where really good. A female manager noticed it was her birthday and offered a gratis dessert. So the night wasn't ruined, but it started out exactly the way she tried to avoid.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
Paula P.,"Lynnfield, MA",0,18,2,5.0,7/22/2016,Wow! Get ready for a great menu and a lot of pleasant servers at the new location at MarketStreet Lynnfield! Officially opening Monday July 25th!

Sarah B.,"Boston, MA",0,10,,5.0,8/7/2016,"My son and I had lunch there last week.  Our waitress, Belinda, could not have been nicer or do enough to ensure our experience was exceptional.  The butter cake was divine.  Can't wait to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
Heidi H.,"Salem, MA",0,13,2,2.0,3/30/2017,"I wish I could write a great review, but unfortunately good food isn't always the deciding factor. I came here on my 22nd birthday with my friends. I have been a server for a few years and try not to criticize but our waitress was AWFUL. worst I've ever had in fact. Our drinks took probably 20 minutes which isn't her fault but instead of pushing the bartender she kind of just walked around and kept saying few more minutes which was annoying. She did not have much knowledge of the menu at all and she let us order not one but two appetizers that they were all out of. Had to reorder twice. Before we even finished our appetizer she took it away and didn't even ask if we were done (which I wasn't). I assumed okay maybe she's clearing room cause the pizza is coming out. Wrong. 20 more minutes with nothing on the table. Finally pizza comes out and it's amazing. California club pizza is TO DIE. once again takes the pizza before we were done and I asked her to box it. I counted the pieces in the box when we left and she didn't put all of it in our box  dessert time aka bday time. They tell her it's my bday and I order a piece of red velvet cake. She comes to the table with it with other staff singing and gives the cake to the wrong person...worst and most awkward happy Birthday in my life. Didn't even apologize after either which I thought was really rude. She kind of ran off and some other server stuck around to apologize. He also got us silverware since she left us with nothing to eat with. Best part she kept the cake on the bill lol. I've always taken a dessert off for a birthday maybe that's just me but how it went down it should not have been on the bill. The next day I thought about it and decided to call and tell the manager what happened because as a former server, it's always in the best interest to be aware of issues so they can be addressed and fixed. And I also felt like I deserved some sort of apology gift card or SOMETHING. like it was my birthday?! Manager basically said sorry that sucks we'll have to do more training. That's it. Didn't even seem to care. I was shocked especially since if my manager ever got a call like that something would've been done immediately. Love the food but will never dine in again at this location. Truly disappointed and my birthday was ruined.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
Errin S.,"Topsfield, MA",0,1,,1.0,8/3/2016,"Awful. I went last Friday when it first opened and it was great. Came back a week later and it was awful. Sat at the bar and my drink was empty for atleast 15 min with no one checking in (FYI we were the only ones sitting at the bar). The two young female bar tenders were too busy gossiping and checking their phones to check I on us. Our pizza took 45 min and was cold. We had to get their attention to tell them 1. We needed silverware 2. Our drinks had been empty for 15 min and 3. Our pizza was cold. Their response was very rude and basically told us to either wait for a new one cuz the ""kitchen was backed up"" (even though there were only 3 other tables there) or suck it up and eat it. I have never complained at a restaurant before but this was unacceptable. Never going back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
Natalie R.,"Wakefield, MA",78,29,,2.0,10/13/2016,"The pizza wasn't bad, server wasn't bad either. It wasn't busy really, maybe it's just super new? The two stars are for the almost 2 hr wait at our table for our meal, which was two pizzas. When we got there, the girl who seated us mentioned this 'pizza dough' rewards app, so we registered because it said ""free small plate when you first register"". We ordered the buffalo cauliflower (not too bad, not great either) because we thought it'd be free.  My husband ordered a beer, but they ran out of what he wanted (no big deal, it happens) so he ordered a 'strong ale' that I don't remember the name of, but the waiter said something like Tibetan monks make it or something...  We then ordered our pizzas, it took at least an hour to get them. Our waiter kept telling us ""pizzas should be right out-- do you guys need bread or anything?"" After the first 3 times of him saying that we said yes to the bread, however never got it.  Finally pizzas come, they're pretty good.  When the check comes, my husband's beer was $5 more expensive than the menu price. The waiter checked, said ""oh, my apologies. I wasn't trying to pull a fast one on you, we have a 750ml bottle as well as a smaller size of that beer that you got."" Still confused, but he fixed the price to the menu so that's fine.. The bottle my husband got was in no way 750ml though...  During all that confusion we tried a few times to give the waiter our code for the free small plate, but the bill never was adjusted for that.  When we left, I said thank you to the hostess, and she just shouted ""bye"" at us. It just kind of came off as rude; usually, even at the most casual places, the people will say thank you back or have a good night, etc.  All in all, probably not going to rush back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
Nic C.,"Lynnfield, MA",0,7,,1.0,11/12/2016,"Went there for a quick meal. Sat at the bar which was half full and not busy. Waited to be greeted. Kayla was busy doing other ""stuff"" but not waiting on customers. Ordered a beer and found the glass to be dirty. Ordered a pizza and waited 42 minutes. Kayla kept apologizing. It came out barely warm. I had a few bites and got it to go.  She could have done the right thing and got the manager and made it right but elected not to or she was ignorant on how to correct a problem.

Lisa R.,"Andover, MA",0,3,,1.0,10/29/2016,"The meal was as expected.

Mark S.,"Lynnfield, MA",0,2,,1.0,9/24/2016,"After waiting 40 minutes for dinner with empty tables around us and asking our server, our food finally arrived.  Three meals were so dry from sitting under the warming lamp they were inedible. The one meal that was still being cooked came out burnt. One kids meal came out ice cold. The manager spoke with us and did comp a lot of the meal, giving us the excuse of it being a new restaurant.  This place has been open for over 3 months.

Bl B.,"Somerville, MA",0,5,,2.0,9/18/2016,"We were very unhappy when the California Pizza Kitchen closed in the Cambridgeside Galeria, as that was our family's favorite place to eat out for years, so we were very happy the new place was opening in Lynnfield. Just got to try it today. It's very loud, with an open kitchen, and loud music. My daughter ordered the pear and gorganzola pizza with no onions - she has eaten this pizza at CPK for years, always excellent - one of the strengths of CPK over the years is the consistency with which they prepare their dishes. Her pizza came, with onions! She sent it back, they made another one - and the new one still had onions!! How hard is it, to leave one ingredient off a pizza? The manager didn't even come over and apologize, and when the waitress brought the bill, we said we weren't paying for that pizza, which she couldn't eat, and then she consulted the manager and took it off the bill. Probably not going back. Too bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=40

Rachel T.,"Peabody, MA",334,111,76,3.0,10/14/2017,"This is an update to my previous review, which is based off of some different pizza and some great customer service. After I posted my original review the management reached it to me via yelp and wanted to get in contact further. They emailed me and apologized for my experience. They did not dismiss any of my comments and made sure to remedy the situation. I really appreciated the quickness of their response, as well as their willingness to accept when sometimes things go wrong. After talking with management, I came in to speak personally to a GM and they apologized and made me feel as if my voice mattered. To me, that's one of the best things a restaurant can do. Listen to their customers. I tried their untraditional cheese pizza, which is not on the menu but is a traditional cheese pizza with tomato sauce. It was good, tasted like the pizza we originally were looking for. To be honest, I'd go back but maybe try something else, maybe a different pizza or one of their pasta dishes. They looked pretty good by my eyes! Overall, I really am astounded that the management went that far to hear my concerns. That to me, is very important. Also my BF revisited their bathroom and it looked good to him!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield

I'm an easy and out going individual who 99% of the time doesn't care and/or sweats the small stuff, so for me to write something?... it has to be pretty bad. 1.) All of the plates we were given, were dirty. You could see the olive oil fingerprint residue and bits of lettuce on each of them. Yuck. And no it wasn't the olive oil seasoning ""flakes""  2.) It took an extremely long time to get a drink bc they have one bartender and mind you, it was a slow evening. Also, stop making excuses for your bartender and get the bartender a backup  3.) Food took a long time... IE we ordered one appetizer and it took almost 15-20 minutes  4.) Salad was okay and pizza was luke warm... food overall gets a 2 out of 5  5.) Hire a competent manager. One waiter can't serve 10-20 tables while the manager stands around doing nothing. Seriously... it's aggravating to witness.

Kimberly K.,"Peabody, MA",51,241,55,2.0,9/17/2016,"Everything was edible. Our service was fine. The setting outdoors with the heaters was quite decent. I just expect more. The pizza is way better at Otto, which is a shame, because this atmosphere is far better. My cocktail, California Roots, tasted ok. It was just too sweet and you couldn't taste any alcohol. The best part was the fennel salt rim, which I got hardly any of, but they promptly fixed it when I requested more. The cocktail portion of the drink menu lacked prices (annoying) but this was 10-something. Not unexpected, but it was an 8-something drink. His pepperoni pizza tasted great, but was dripping in bright orange pepperoni oil. The bottom was drenched with it. It was gross. With a tiny pre-plating dab, this mediocre pizza could've been awesome. I got the Pear Gorgonzola, with ranch on the side. Glad I did that, as the ranch was ""just ranch."" Ew. A tiny drip moistened the pizza, but that's about it. The Gorgonzola crumbles were meager and the pears were not roasted and flavorful. In fact, the whole pizza just tasted like a cheese cracker. I'm amazed at how flavorless one of the strongest/flavored pizzas at other places can be here. It wasn't horrible, but it was just kinda meh. That, and they put regular old salad greens on top. At least 6 were rotten, which takes 3 seconds of quality control. Lame. Please use arugula, roasted pears and pungent gorg.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield
Sarah F.,"Peabody, MA",0,72,1,2.0,3/8/2017,"Went here with my husband and man were we disappointed big time!! It's restaurant week, so they had a special menus and went with that. The Bread they served was STALE!! Hard as a rock and had a weird taste to it. Kind of like sour milk.  I ordered the Spinach dip as an appetizer- it was ok, needed more cheese for me and some of the chips were stale as well. Beginning to think if anything is fresh at this point. Tasted like they just took a cream of spinach package and used that. I had their Kung Pao Spaghetti (did not realize that it didn't come with any meat) and their pasta is VERY Dente. Meal would  have been better with chicken. Now for dessert i had their butter cake-OMG!!!! Wicked good and I would go back just to have that. I also had their Honey Lemonade , this consists of Jack Daniels and Lemonade- Yummy! My husband ordered the chicken dumplings for his appetizer and they were good, only issue is the plate was cold so they cooled down FAST! He had their Chicken Alfredo for his meal. His Pasta was definitely Ala Dente Some pieces he could not even eat. It was also bland, just needed some spices. For dessert he got the Chocolate Soufflé. He said it wasn't anything special. He ordered a drink, said he's not sure what the bartender made as it did not taste like what he normally gets. I guess maybe we should have stuck with their pizza.

Unfortunately, this place was very disappointing. I ordered online and that was a very easy experience so that's a plus. I was sad to see their hamburger pizza is no longer offered. I went with the sausage one. The prices are high, especially when you see the tiny portion. I picked it up and it was ready after a little wait which is reasonable on a Sunday. The inside of the restaurant looks nice. I got the pizza home and was disappointed at how tiny it was. It was also smothered in pepperoni and wasn't a pleasant pizza experience. I like to taste the sauce and cheese not just feel like I'm eating dough with meat on it. We didn't even finish the pizza and it was small - that's how overwhelming the meat was on it.

And then waited some more. The only other table seated was one outside and the server seemed attentive to them. Who was our server? Good question. Because after 20 minutes we decided that being ignored wasn't on the menu for today. We got up to leave and there were 3 people in the hostess stand chatting. They politely said to have a nice day.

After I posted my original review the management reached it to me via yelp and wanted to get in contact further. They emailed me and apologized for my experience. They did not dismiss any of my comments and made sure to remedy the situation. I really appreciated the quickness of their response, as well as their willingness to accept when sometimes things go wrong. After talking with management, I came in to speak personally to a GM and they apologized and made me feel as if my voice mattered. To me, that's one of the best things a restaurant can do. Listen to their customers. I tried their untraditional cheese pizza, which is not on the menu but is a traditional cheese pizza with tomato sauce. It was good, tasted like the pizza we originally were looking for. To be honest, I'd go back but maybe try something else, maybe a different pizza or one of their pasta dishes. They looked pretty good by my eyes! Overall, I really am astounded that the management went that far to hear my concerns. That to me, is very important.

I'm an easy and out going individual who 99% of the time doesn't care and/or sweats the small stuff, so for me to write something?... it has to be pretty bad. 1.) All of the plates we were given, were dirty. You could see the olive oil fingerprint residue and bits of lettuce on each of them. Yuck. And no it wasn't the olive oil seasoning ""flakes""  2.) It took an extremely long time to get a drink bc they have one bartender and mind you, it was a slow evening. Also, stop making excuses for your bartender and get the bartender a backup  3.) Food took a long time... IE we ordered one appetizer and it took almost 15-20 minutes  4.) Salad was okay and pizza was luke warm... food overall gets a 2 out of 5  5.) Hire a competent manager.

Kimberly K.,"Peabody, United States",51,241,55,2.0,17/9/2016,"Everything was edible. Our service was fine. The setting outdoors with the heaters was quite decent. I just expect more. The pizza is way better at Otto, which is a shame, because this atmosphere is far better. My cocktail, California Roots, tasted ok. It was just too sweet and you couldn't taste any alcohol. The best part was the fennel salt rim, which I got hardly any of, but they promptly fixed it when I requested more. The cocktail portion of the drink menu lacked prices (annoying) but this was 10-something. Not unexpected, but it was an 8-something drink. His pepperoni pizza tasted great, but was dripping in bright orange pepperoni oil. The bottom was drenched with it. It was gross. With a tiny pre-plating dab, this mediocre pizza could've been awesome. I got the Pear Gorgonzola, with ranch on the side. Glad I did that, as the ranch was ""just ranch."" Ew. A tiny drip moistened the pizza, but that's about it. The Gorgonzola crumbles were meager and the pears were not roasted and flavorful. In fact, the whole pizza just tasted like a cheese cracker. I'm amazed at how flavorless one of the strongest/flavored pizzas at other places can be here. It wasn't horrible, but it was just kinda meh. That, and they put regular old salad greens on top. At least 6 were rotten, which takes 3 seconds of quality control. Lame. Please use arugula, roasted pears and pungent gorg.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield

The Bread they served was STALE!! Hard as a rock and had a weird taste to it. Kind of like sour milk.  I ordered the Spinach dip as an appetizer- it was ok, needed more cheese for me and some of the chips were stale as well. Beginning to think if anything is fresh at this point. Tasted like they just took a cream of spinach package and used that. I had their Kung Pao Spaghetti (did not realize that it didn't come with any meat) and their pasta is VERY Dente. Meal would  have been better with chicken. Now for dessert i had their butter cake-OMG!!!! Wicked good and I would go back just to have that. I also had their Honey Lemonade , this consists of Jack Daniels and Lemonade- Yummy! My husband ordered the chicken dumplings for his appetizer and they were good, only issue is the plate was cold so they cooled down FAST! He had their Chicken Alfredo for his meal. His Pasta was definitely Ala Dente Some pieces he could not even eat. It was also bland, just needed some spices. For dessert he got the Chocolate Soufflé. He said it wasn't anything special. He ordered a drink, said he's not sure what the bartender made as it did not taste like what he normally gets. I guess maybe we should have stuck with their pizza. If we go back maybe I'll just stick to that and dessert. That's a BIG if!! Our waitress was good. She even fixed our bill when we found they had charged us extra for my husbands pasta!

The one we got was a bartender so she made me a Moscow mule which was pretty amazing. She also recommended the lemon/lime pasta which was delicious. My husband got the Bolognese pasta which was okay. Wasn't really seasoned well but what do you expect from a tomato pasta? No points off on it though. We also got the ice cream and cake and key lime pie for dessert which was also pretty good.

Miranda M.,"Waltham, United States",120,2,,4.0,1/8/2016,"My boyfriend and I went here for the first time yesterday and had a great dinner. The servers were all very attentive, as this location just opened a couple days ago. We redeemed a coupon for a free small plate through the rewards app and chose the chips and guac, which was DELICIOUS- the guacamole/corn thing they had was very good! Will definitely go with that again. We each got pizzas (I got the 5-cheese and tomato, while my boyfriend got the works), but if we go there again we would probably just get one pizza to split- I ended up having some of mine leftover. The location looked very clean and trendy. There were some little mistakes (not enough drink menus so we didn't get one initially and then had to share, not knowing how to process the free small plate reward at first, messing up our check) but the staff dealt with all of the mistakes with grace and efficiency. I think most of these things can be attributed to how new the restaurant/staff is. We overheard some issues with other tables (food coming out at different times to the same table, plates being dropped, etc.) but again, this is a new location.  One critique for the chain in general- why is the menu lacking in the beer department? Very few beers available other than your typical Bud Light/Sam Adams/Blue Moon etc. I don't think you have to go crazy with it, but when I order a pizza, I generally want a beer, not wine or sangria. (My boyfriend and I got wine and sangria, respectively, and agreed that while the drinks were good, they didn't pair as well with the pizza) Overall, a good start with a few hiccups at this new location.

Michael K.,"Boston, United States",0,42,1,1.0,15/8/2016,"We have visited this restaurant a few times since they opened last month.  At first we were very excited because the menu offers a variety of California inspired items for every palate.  Our first visit didn't go so well and we figured it was because the servers were just learning the ins and outs of the restaurant themselves and we understood that. The second time we visited a week later, the service was still not up to par with our expectations.  In both instances, it took a while to receive our beverages and to actually place our orders.  Our entrees also came out lukewarm which may be because the restaurant was so cold due to the air conditioning.   This past weekend, we ordered again from this restaurant but instead of dining in chose to order food for takeout and eat at home.  It was a huge mistake!!! Both of our items were not properly made and the chefs didn't follow any of the customizations that we had requested.  After 3 visits to this restaurant and walking away with ill feelings, we will never be back.  It's a shame because this restaurant really could have been a place to visit frequently.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
Lauren B.,"Wilmington, United States",0,2,,1.0,21/4/2017,"They cannot get an order correct.  Out of my last 5 experiences there, they have screwed up the order 4 times.  Service is always mediocre. I finally got frustrated enough to email customer service and shockingly enough - no response.  Obviously they have some extremely poor management at this particular location.  Too bad.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
Tony G.,"Lynnfield, United States",0,3,,1.0,26/12/2016,"Horrible horrible, cant believe I have to leave a star! I had a call ahead res, arrived to a half full dining room, with the entire staff running around, and no hostess. waited a good 10 minutes, only to be greeted with a ""15 minute wait"". When I asked why I couldnt just sit anywhere that was open, which was plenty, I was told there were no servers to attend to my table. Walked out, only hope CPK gets it right and shuts down this location, they are to good of a chain to let Lynnfield drag them down",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
Sharrun N.,"Wakefield, United States",0,33,,2.0,5/8/2016,"My daughter brought a large group to this location for her birthday tonight. She called in advance on Monday and three times tonight and spoke with different women who said coming at 6:30 would be fine and there would be a table ready for them.  When they got there at 6:32, they were told by a male manager that they were 20 minutes late and their table had been given away. He insisted the call ahead time was for 6:15, although she never spoke with him. No apology. No suggesting a way to accommodate them other than making them wait 45 minutes.  We have both worked in restaurants and go with the philosophy that the customer is always right. At the very least, the customer is not flat out told that they are wrong. Once they were seated, the wait staff and food where really good. A female manager noticed it was her birthday and offered a gratis dessert. So the night wasn't ruined, but it started out exactly the way she tried to avoid.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
Paula P.,"Lynnfield, United States",0,18,2,5.0,22/7/2016,Wow! Get ready for a great menu and a lot of pleasant servers at the new location at MarketStreet Lynnfield!

Sarah B.,"Boston, United States",0,10,,5.0,7/8/2016,"My son and I had lunch there last week.  Our waitress, Belinda, could not have been nicer or do enough to ensure our experience was exceptional.  The butter cake was divine.  Can't wait to go back.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
Heidi H.,"Salem, United States",0,13,2,2.0,30/3/2017,"I wish I could write a great review, but unfortunately good food isn't always the deciding factor. I came here on my 22nd birthday with my friends. I have been a server for a few years and try not to criticize but our waitress was AWFUL. worst I've ever had in fact. Our drinks took probably 20 minutes which isn't her fault but instead of pushing the bartender she kind of just walked around and kept saying few more minutes which was annoying. She did not have much knowledge of the menu at all and she let us order not one but two appetizers that they were all out of. Had to reorder twice. Before we even finished our appetizer she took it away and didn't even ask if we were done (which I wasn't). I assumed okay maybe she's clearing room cause the pizza is coming out. Wrong. 20 more minutes with nothing on the table. Finally pizza comes out and it's amazing. California club pizza is TO DIE. once again takes the pizza before we were done and I asked her to box it. I counted the pieces in the box when we left and she didn't put all of it in our box  dessert time aka bday time. They tell her it's my bday and I order a piece of red velvet cake. She comes to the table with it with other staff singing and gives the cake to the wrong person...worst and most awkward happy Birthday in my life. Didn't even apologize after either which I thought was really rude. She kind of ran off and some other server stuck around to apologize. He also got us silverware since she left us with nothing to eat with. Best part she kept the cake on the bill lol. I've always taken a dessert off for a birthday maybe that's just me but how it went down it should not have been on the bill. The next day I thought about it and decided to call and tell the manager what happened because as a former server, it's always in the best interest to be aware of issues so they can be addressed and fixed. And I also felt like I deserved some sort of apology gift card or SOMETHING. like it was my birthday?! Manager basically said sorry that sucks we'll have to do more training. That's it. Didn't even seem to care. I was shocked especially since if my manager ever got a call like that something would've been done immediately. Love the food but will never dine in again at this location. Truly disappointed and my birthday was ruined.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
Errin S.,"Topsfield, United States",0,1,,1.0,3/8/2016,"Awful. I went last Friday when it first opened and it was great. Came back a week later and it was awful. Sat at the bar and my drink was empty for atleast 15 min with no one checking in (FYI we were the only ones sitting at the bar). The two young female bar tenders were too busy gossiping and checking their phones to check I on us. Our pizza took 45 min and was cold. We had to get their attention to tell them 1. We needed silverware 2. Our drinks had been empty for 15 min and 3. Our pizza was cold. Their response was very rude and basically told us to either wait for a new one cuz the ""kitchen was backed up"" (even though there were only 3 other tables there) or suck it up and eat it. I have never complained at a restaurant before but this was unacceptable. Never going back again.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
Natalie R.,"Wakefield, United States",78,29,,2.0,13/10/2016,"The pizza wasn't bad, server wasn't bad either. It wasn't busy really, maybe it's just super new? The two stars are for the almost 2 hr wait at our table for our meal, which was two pizzas. When we got there, the girl who seated us mentioned this 'pizza dough' rewards app, so we registered because it said ""free small plate when you first register"". We ordered the buffalo cauliflower (not too bad, not great either) because we thought it'd be free.  My husband ordered a beer, but they ran out of what he wanted (no big deal, it happens) so he ordered a 'strong ale' that I don't remember the name of, but the waiter said something like Tibetan monks make it or something...  We then ordered our pizzas, it took at least an hour to get them. Our waiter kept telling us ""pizzas should be right out-- do you guys need bread or anything?"" After the first 3 times of him saying that we said yes to the bread, however never got it.  Finally pizzas come, they're pretty good.  When the check comes, my husband's beer was $5 more expensive than the menu price. The waiter checked, said ""oh, my apologies. I wasn't trying to pull a fast one on you, we have a 750ml bottle as well as a smaller size of that beer that you got."" Still confused, but he fixed the price to the menu so that's fine.. The bottle my husband got was in no way 750ml though...  During all that confusion we tried a few times to give the waiter our code for the free small plate, but the bill never was adjusted for that.  When we left, I said thank you to the hostess, and she just shouted ""bye"" at us. It just kind of came off as rude; usually, even at the most casual places, the people will say thank you back or have a good night, etc.  All in all, probably not going to rush back here.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
Nic C.,"Lynnfield, United States",0,7,,1.0,12/11/2016,"Went there for a quick meal. Sat at the bar which was half full and not busy. Waited to be greeted. Kayla was busy doing other ""stuff"" but not waiting on customers. Ordered a beer and found the glass to be dirty. Ordered a pizza and waited 42 minutes. Kayla kept apologizing. It came out barely warm. I had a few bites and got it to go.  She could have done the right thing and got the manager and made it right but elected not to or she was ignorant on how to correct a problem. Sorry CPK, not going back. There are plenty of other restaurants that get it right.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
Lisa R.,"Andover, United States",0,3,,1.0,29/10/2016,"The meal was as expected. Ok pizza, average service.  Nothing great, nothing awful until my daughter discovered a bug crawling around in her salad.  The server seemed ambivalent.   The chef could care less and the manager basically ignored the issue.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20
