Deja A.,"Beaverton, OR",12,189,510,4.0,2/19/2016,"I've only tried C.P.K once before in the US but I didn't order Pizza which is what they're known for. I had gotten a sandwich. This time I wanted to see what the hype was all about even though I'm not a big Pizza fan. My bf and I visited this location about a week ago & we both ordered pizzas. I ordered Pepperoni Â Pizza Supreme and I don't remember what his was called but it had sausage, mushrooms and pepperonis on it.  Both were super good, very cheesy and for no more than $150 each pizza. I felt was sooo worth what we received our waiter was wonderful. I wish I remembered his name.  They make their pizza in a wood burning oven, which you can see as soon as you walk into the doors on the left. Super cool! We both also ordered Mojitos, but sadly its always a hit or miss w/drinks and it was sadly a miss!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-m%C3%A9xico-5
Galal G.,"Atlanta, GA",0,5,,2.0,7/7/2017,"I told the lady who works there that I don't eat pork/bacon etc , gave me my take out and the pizza has bacon all over it and I only found out about it when I went home to eat ! Terrible won't go there again !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-m%C3%A9xico-5
v v v.,"San Jose, CA",0,8,,1.0,12/23/2016,"Walked in to this place. Took 10 minutes for some one to seat us though the place was empty. After 15 minute wait at the table no one showed up to take our order. Decided CPK is better patronized back home and walked out. Of course no one was bothered to see us go. Surely, they redefined hospitality!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-m%C3%A9xico-5
Tracy L.,"Clearwater, FL",0,14,,4.0,11/28/2015,"Went to this restaurant two more times since my last review. The food is great and the waiters have been very helpful. My only complaint is with the hostesses on the last two visits. The first one yawned more than once while talking to us about where we'd like to sit. Not a polite yawn, but wide open mouth and making sound. The second time the hostess came out with food in her mouth, chewing with her mouth open and crumbs of food on her lips.  Again, great food, but the management should take an interest in their front door staff who greet the customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-m%C3%A9xico-5
