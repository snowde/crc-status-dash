Yvonne C.,"Toronto, Canada",35,6,9,1.0,4/1/2017,"If there was an option to give 0 stars I would. I walk in with my boyfriend on a quiet afternoon, around 2 pm and was completely ignored for a good 20 minutes. The server we had realized we only spoke English and walked away and ignored us after. I had to wave down the hostess to take my order, they ended up forgetting our appetizer...overall food was ok nothing special but they should really work on training their waiters to not ignore people...not the way to treat your guests.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-m%C3%A9xico-7
