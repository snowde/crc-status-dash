Pamela A.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,8,,4.0,12/22/2017,"Jim is a great server.  We had a really lovely early dinner ordering Margarita pizza (which was PERFECT) and Green Pea-Barley soup for me (it's cold outside; this was nice and warming). Normally we love this restuarant, but... first of all the female hostess  welcomed us as 'Hi, Guys!""  We are two women.  She took us to our booth and again called us guys.  Just a little disconcerting. The music was awful and really too loud.  There was quite a din.  We often eat here and have not noticed the music being so loud and not really fit for eating and conversation. I do want to say, that when we thanked anyone for their service, they DID NOT say ""No problem.""  Thank you!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach
Willis W.,"San Gabriel, CA",233,344,31,3.0,12/20/2017,"Parking: Right in front of Macy's. CPK is surrounded by parking. We came here for a celebration for work and reserved the patio area. The only complaint was that they didn't arrange the sun shade to block the light from blinding everybody. The servers were busy helping the people inside so I can't blame them.  But other than putting on some sunglasses, the food was what you expect. It isn't phenomenal but it will fill you up. I got the Kung Pao Spaghetti and it was more salty than spicy. I added chicken to it and there was very little chicken. For 13+ bucks, I do not recommend it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach
Maria S.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",0,30,,3.0,1/7/2018,"Always reliable. I ordered flatbread which was delicious but skimpy on ingredients.  Also, why no calorie count on menu?

Alyse T.,"Torrance, CA",207,158,859,3.0,5/28/2017,"Decent place for lunch! Located just outside of the Manhattan Beach Mall, CPK has reliably adequate food and service and is a nice break from the drag of the office.  I came here recently on a Friday afternoon for lunch with 5 coworkers. Even though we were a large party, the restaurant wasn't nearly full so we were seated quickly. I was happy to learn that they offer a ""Lunch Duo"" option now, where you choose either a smaller personal pizza or sandwich, and a soup or salad. I ordered: Lunch Duo with Shaved Mushroom & Spinach Pizza and Caesar Salad ($11.95): the pizza is 7"" which is a great portion for lunch, especially when you need to return to the office. The spinach was nice and garlicky, but I would have liked more mushroom.  The lunch duos are also one of the more affordable options for lunch. Our servers were also pretty quick, understanding we needed to return to the office fairly quickly. I would definitely come back for another combo!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach
Ruben B.,"Castaic, CA",6,20,33,4.0,1/12/2018,"One of our favorite places to come too. Have never really been here or at a CPK for lunch before. We always come for dinner. Lunch menu looks good, pizza & a salad and the wife had there potato soup. As usual food was good & service was good. The only reason fir 4 star and not 5 is because choices to pizza & salad were limited but good still.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach
Robert V.,"Los Angeles, CA",3149,400,225,5.0,3/5/2017,"Wasn't a big fan of CPK after my horrible experience at the Hollywood location; however, after management reached out to me I decided to try it again and come to this location.  Everything was awesome as the service was great and the Italian Chopped Salad was chopped and served to perfection. The manager stopped by and told him everything was great. He mentioned to me that the kitchen staff has been here a long time and they follow the original menus of CPK which is why the food is a higher standard.  Will absolutely be back and check out my photo on the chopped salad as this is as good as it gets!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach
Alex W.,"Playa Vista, Los Angeles, CA",407,629,1513,3.0,8/24/2017,"Upon this visit to this California chain famous for inventing the BBQ Chicken Pizza I decided to opt for a listed Menu Favorite, the Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza.  The pizza was decent, but at $15 it's a bit pricey and on the small side if you ask me.  Frankly, I'd say that most of the dishes are overpriced.  My ex's mom though was a big chain restaurant fan and she loves good ole CPK.  As for me, I'll typically go with more local options.  Perfectly fine, but nothing special.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach
Roger W.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",3,27,,1.0,12/14/2017,"Very disappointed, enjoyed this restaurant for years but recently food has become very subpar. We visited last month and quality of food had seriously deteriorated. I wrote an email to management and received no reply. At that point I should have realized that management couldn't care less, but we made one last visit in hopes that things might have improved. Once again quality of food was terrible.

Lee F.,"Encino, CA",222,440,1564,4.0,2/26/2017,"A cool location for CPK in Manhattan Beach. The place is pretty busy and it gets noisy during lunch. For an appetizer, I highly recommend the Avacado Rolls. Crunchy rolls filled with avocado, bacon, and cheese. It is super delicious. The pizzas are great and our server Gabby was very nice.

Leslie S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",676,535,470,4.0,7/27/2016,"A safe choice. And an even better choice for picky eaters who are afraid to try new and different foods. This only happens to me when travelling with big groups where it is hard to decide on a place for everyone to enjoy. For some reason it was very crowded when we arrived but they gave us an option to be seated immediately outside on one of their patios. They were even nice enough to inform us that one of the patios was about to be used by a graduation party so we definitely went with the other patio. Not that it made much difference because right as we sat down another graduation party sat next to us but still, it was nice of them to offer. My mom and I split a veggie pizza and salad. It was plenty of food and we still had a couple slices left over. We didn't have any dessert this time but they do have a very good tiramisu!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach
Alan B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",5,145,153,5.0,4/1/2017,"This review is not just about the food & service but the senior staff as well! Our meal, Caesar Salad, Cheese & tomato pizza & the salmon were delicious & prepared to our specific order. Our waiter, a 16 year vet, was terrific.  Here's we're our next category comes in to play! After dinner our bill was presented, needing to leave I put our gift certificate & CC out to take care of the bill. Well our waiter came back & said there's nothing on the gift card? Say again, well needing to leave & of course not being his fault, I said run the CC & we left.  The next day I called & spoke with Brain the assistant GM who was not only understanding but after listing to my tale, simply said how much was on the gift card, I told him then he said I'm terribly sorry for the inconvenience, please come in at your convenience and ask for me, I'll have a replacement card ready and activated waiting for you!!  Talking about great customer service, Brian, your sir are what great CS is all about!! A solid 5 out of 5 stars!

Stephanie R.,"Los Angeles, CA",213,4,1,2.0,10/26/2017,"Sorry guys - I love your food, but today was not so great. To start, I ordered a catering package for curbside pickup and there was no place to park, so I had to park in the lot and walk in. I had specified curbside delivery at 11:00 and I waited in the restaurant until 11:40 to receive my order. I hate to complain, but when I'm spending lots of $$$ for a business lunch I'm responsible for hosting, I need to be assured I won't be left hanging. Again, so sorry to leave a poor review, but I want to keep using you and need the timing to be better! :) That said, on the plus side, everyone was very nice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach

Glad to see that the waiters and waitresses didn't pay too much attention the pups (to overexcite them), but our waiter was very nice enough to provide them each waters!

Melissa R.,"Carson, CA",18,27,100,4.0,12/24/2016,"I loooooove CPK, and I've never had a bad experience at this location. The servers are always attentive, the food is always great, and there's plenty of seating so there's never a wait either.  Dropped in on Christmas Eve expecting a ton of hangry Christmas shoppers but was pleasantly surprised. We got seated right away, and I tried a Blood Orange Sangria and an order of hummus to start. The sangria was good, a little sweeter than expected though. The hummus was delicious, and the bread it was served with was warm and fresh.  I ordered a bowl of the tortilla soup and a BBQ chopped chicken salad, and my friend ordered a carne asada pizza (seasonal option). Everything was amaaaazing. I'm never disappointed by anything with avocado, chicken, tomato, etc. My friend's carne asada pizza was great too. It came with a delicious green salsa to top the pizza with, great addition to the pizza.

Though, their great customer service and professionalism made up for the wait. Some places will quickly speed up service when they are 30 min from closing and they continued to be assertive. They both took time to help me figure out my order, and even catered to my 5 year old. As she was coughing, Tristian immediately asked if my daughter wanted water.

Anna R.,"Fort Worth, TX",11,226,1114,5.0,5/20/2016,"CPK is one of my favorite dine-in restaurants. What I come for and always get: 1. Chicken Tequila Fettuccine: Creamy jalapeno lime sauce with spinach fettuccine, red onions, bell peppers, and fresh cilantro **TIP: Ask for lime slices and squeeze it on top of your dish before eating! (1-2 lime slices depending on your liking) 2. Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pizza: Chipotle adobo sauce, shaved poblanos and Monterey Jack with housemade roasted corn & black bean salsa, fresh cilantro, and tangy lime crema This time I just came for a FREE DESSERT.  (CPK Rewards - Free dessert for your birthday. GO SIGN UP!!) Belgian Chocolate Souffle Cake: Warm chocolate cake served w/ triple-thick hot fudge and vanilla bean sauce (scoop of Haagen-Dazs ice cream for additional cost) **TIP: Ask for the ice cream on the side! It comes out in a separate cup so it's not touching the warm cake at all.

Another ten minutes went by and our food finally arrived. My order was wrong of course. I had to wait another 15 minutes for them to bring out the correct order. The fact that I was starving made things 10x worse. We didn't complain but the manager just happened to walk by and notice our drinks were still not out. Turns out the waitress forgot them inside. He did come out at the end and gave us both a card stating our next meal was on them but it was a little too late!

Sergey E.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",35,40,15,3.0,11/5/2016,"I eat here often with my family, the food is always 5 stars. Managers are cool. Some redhead waitress once literally had me storming out pissed off though. First she hands us nasty silverware, with a big glob of food dried on it. I ask her to double check for a clean set and she blindly grabs another set that's still wrapped up-- clearly didn't check. We ask for water, stressing that she check the glasses. Of course, one is dirty. Appetizer late, arrives after food, but awesome manager immediately runs over and takes it off the bill, totally unprompted. Cool! Food and drinks are delicious. Now, there's a promo... $10 off of 40. Were at like $58 with tax n drinks, but $35 without. I ask the waitress how much were at and she says she will check. Comes back and says ""you guys still need another $15, so I don't think it's worth it"" and plops the bill on the desk before disappearing. I immediately know she's lying, and review the bill. Yep. Almost exactly the amount of one dessert.  I flagged her down like 5 times but she never came back so I had to grab another waiter/manager to order a pie to reach the discount. paid the bill and walked out without waiting for the pie. Sweetheart manager rushed out to our car to bring us the pie.

We also had pizza dough piadina rewards but our server didn't let us use that. Once we placed the order, we asked our server to get us more bread and refills for our drinks which he never did. The food also took a long time to come out and when a girl came out with food, we asked her for more bread and refills and she told us that the server will take care of it. I had ordered a pasta and wanted some parmesan cheese on them. Had to wait and remind the server for cheese and again for drinks and more bread. Got the refills but not the bread. Then when the manager walked by we reminded him that this is not how service should be. Our request to get more bread was heard and ignored 3 times.

Flagging down a server for more cocktails or wine is annoying...not to mention detrimental to the service establishments sales. In any case despite the crowd and 20 minute wait for a table, we sat immediately at the bar. Always enjoy sitting at the bar...it's fun to watch the food prep and smell the delicious aromatics from the kitchen. I had my favorite halibut with farrow and butternut squash which I'm afraid was subpar this visit.  The fish was dry as was the farrow and I counted only 3 cubes of squash. The asparagus was decent, but I still had to cut an inch and a half off the end...simply too stringy and chewy (I usually have to do this anyway before I steam or sauté...this step may have been missed.) I absolutely must let the team know next time...this time I allowed the busy day mask the problems with the preparation and I'm sure they would have liked to know.

Franco M.,"Downey, CA",80,332,246,2.0,7/13/2016,"Haven't eaten from this chain in years and forgot if I liked it or not. It was alright, but too pricey for what it is. Ordered ""The Works"" Pizza. Came with green bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, olives, sausage, and pepperoni. I also decided to add two sunny side up eggs on my pizza and immediately regretted it when the pizza came and I saw that one of the eggs was smashed. The yolk was running everywhere turning the crust into a cold, soggy mess. The pizza was alright, but the soggy crust made it really unappetizing. We did get delivery though, so maybe the two eggs on the pizza is properly executed when dining in, but for delivery I would hold off on the eggs. The pizza itself reminded me of frozen pizza. Bland toppings, sauce and crust, but edible! Thought the sausage was decent. I also didn't think the prices were justified by the quality of ingredients. About 17 bucks for a tiny pizza with cold, soggy crust covered in cold egg goo (not counting tax and tip). I won't be too eager to come back here anytime soon Pros: + Decent sausage Cons: - Poorly executed/delivered pizza - Bland cheese - Soggy crust - Pricey",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach?start=40

The service here was very attentive and friendly. They stopped by several times to refill drinks and to bring out extra items that we asked for. // FOOD // BBQ chicken chopped salad: This is always a must for me when I come to CPK. The salad is so refreshing with lettuce, corn, beans, tomatoes and shredded chicken in a ranch sauce with BBQ sauce on top. The slice of lime that they serve with it adds on extra flavor.  Habanero carnitas pizza: This is probably one of my more favorite pizzas at CPK. Shredded carnitas, red onions with a habanero sauce on the side. This pizza is definitely packed with flavor. The carnitas adds a smoky flavor while the habanero sauce adds heat, but also some sweetness to the pizza.  Chicken piccata: The chicken piccata was pretty good. It was served with pasta and I really enjoyed the sauce. It had the right amount of lemon to it, but also the butter and capers added plenty of salt to the dish. Overall, this was a great CPK location to come to. I will definitely be back if I'm around the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach?start=40

I came with my mom for dinner on a Friday since it was right across from her office. We were seated right away, but from the get go there were kids literally running everywhere and screaming all over the place. My mom ordered her usual Moroccan-Spiced Chicken Salad with roasted butternut squash, dates, avocado, toasted almonds, beets, red peppers, chopped egg, cranberries, and tossed with their house-made Champagne vinaigrette. She really likes it, but I didn't care for it. I ordered the White Pizza with Mozzarella, Ricotta, Parmesan, Pecorino Romano, sautéed spinach and roasted garlic. That's what I ordered 15 years ago, but it wasn't as I remembered. The roasted garlic came in huge chunks sparsely dispersed over the pizza. It's pretty gross to get a bite full of garlic. I would much rather prefer to have smaller crushed pieces over the whole pie. Other than that, it still wasn't very good. The White Top from Blaze is better, faster, and tastier. I also ordered a watermelon lemonade. A manager who brought our order to our table asked if I wanted a refill. I said, ""Yes, please."" He came back with a drink that was orange rather than pink. Before I even said anything he assured me that it was a watermelon lemonade, but from a different machine. Once I tasted it, I realized that it was a mango lemonade. It was fine. However, why tell me it's for sure watermelon when it wasn't and obviously didn't even look the same. Service from our waitress was alright. However, with the sup-par food and ambiance, I won't be coming back. At least not for another 15 years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach?start=60
Mia K.,"Los Angeles, CA",127,354,319,4.0,5/15/2014,"CPK serves more than pizza and I've been happy with their food the past two times I've been here. They have good choices for their light menu. You can get pasta, sandwiches, salads and of course, unique pizzas like Chipotle chicken with poblanos and roasted corn.  Lunch service was very slow, possibly so because our group of 7 was served by two waitresses.  I think there was confusion between servers and also miscommunication with the kitchen as a result.  My friends, who are regulars, say the service is usually good. I wish they hadn't waited 20 minutes to ask us if we wanted bread.  Our food: -Margharita pizza - we ordered goat cheese with it and it was awesome. Great crust, too. Big pieces of basil, not skimpy shreds.  -BBQ chicken salad - good but needed more dressing.  -Lite shrimp scampi w zucchini slices - good but the lemon taste dominated the garlic too much. I like how they added the zucchini to make it healthier.  Another light option I had before is the - arugala quinoa, feta cheese salad with added chicken. Excellent and filling.  -Kung pao chicken with spaghetti - I didn't try it but my friend gave it a thumbs up -Bianco flatbread pizza - white truffle cream Gorgonzola, mozzarella and fresh sage. My friend's mother loved it.  -Spicy fennel sausage and poblano flatbread - good but only small pieces of sausage -Kids' curly pasta with butter and cheese - big bowl but the boy inhaled this and still ate other food  -Chicken piccata. My sister has a garlic allergy. She ordered the chicken piccata after learning it had no garlic. She found some pieces that looked like garlic and spoke to our waitress and showed them. The waitress got the manager who assured us the recipe hangs in the kitchen and is garlic free. He offered to remake the dish but my sister opted instead to get a Hawaiian personal pizza, which they rushed to be made. The pizza had large pieces of both ham and the fruit. I'm not a fan but it was a good slice.  CAUTION: Kids beverages are really sweet. I would taste your child's lemonade. It was way too sweet and needed diluting. Kids have enough energy as it is.  CPK is a casual place with good value for fair prices.  I may find myself here more often because there are more things I want to try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach?start=60

Niles C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,68,,2.0,1/7/2016,"I have been coming to this location for over 20 years. It unfortunately has evolved into a different type of establishment that its creators had originally intended. Once a casual, yet avant-garde restaurant has turned into a loud, kid packed, mess hall.  I could say that this change might be due to a changing demographic and a new wave of young families moving into the area. This though, is not the case as the change in clientele is reflective of CPKs menu. CPK was known for introducing new and exciting entrees with particular emphasis on Pizza. Now, the menu has stagnated and many items are becoming long in the tooth. The menu isn't reflective of an exciting offering, but rather entrees that appeal to a child's palate. That goes for all CPKs and not just this establishment. Additionally, the noise level is pretty high at this store and management has decided to play loud music to drown it out. This isn't working. Recommendations The Kung Pao Spaghetti is still very good. I hope this isn't removed from the menu. Avocado egg rolls are also very good.

She was really nice and fast. A different server brought us some bread and dipping oil. Ah May ZING. Where did they get this magical olive oil? I have no idea but its freakin good. The bread was soft and warm. Perfection. We ordered, the food came fast and was excellent. We decided on an Italian Chopped Salad and White Pizza with bacon added. Outstanding.

Jenn G.,"Torrance, CA",1680,1066,6642,4.0,9/11/2010,"Birthday celebration via @calpizzakitchen.  My coworkers and I seem to frequent this location for celebrations and we've always been treated pretty well. I remember at one celebration, the waiter accidentally spilled water on me and the manager offered me a free appetizer, meal and dessert.  Just recently my coworkers and I found ourselves here again. My coworkers were very sweet to treat me to a birthday lunch here at CPK.  They know it's one of my favorite places to eat. I love all the different pizza choices on their menu. I also like how they offer all kinds of pastas and salads. This trip here I decided to choose the wild mushroom pizza with chicken. I knew i wanted this pizza when I saw that it had these different types of mushrooms (Cremini, Shiitake, Portobello and white mushrooms) . I was also intrigued with the fact that this pizza had a wild mushroom walnut pesto. I was not wrong with my choice because it was delicious :). I think I may just have found a new CPK favorite. For all the mushroom lovers out there, this pizza is for you. Along with this meal, I got the mango iced tea. It is one of my favorite drinks here.  From the very start, the folks working here were quick to greet me a happy birthday. At the end of the meal, the waiter surprised me with a birthday song and a birthday sundae. It was vanilla ice cream mixed in with chocolate syrup and whipped cream and topped with a cherry. It was great :).  Thanks again to CPK for another cool celebration here :).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach?start=100

Although the environment was very nice and the service was outstanding, the nucleus to any establishment is the food.  However, maybe I was just ordering the wrong dishes! Last night, I ordered the Pesto Penne with shrimp and chicken. Again, it was okay.  BUT! My buddy ordered a thin crust Sicilian pizza. This is where they got me!

Tonight the manager on duty was of no help as he was slow to correct  3 bad meals and lacked an aplogy for a very disappointing dining experience!

The guacamole dish is tiny.  Maybe 2 dozen chips on the plate and a scoop of the guacamole dip.  Not great.  In fact, kinda tasteless and I really love guacamole.  A good 2.  The white corn kernels they put in there are pretty dominant in the dip but was seriously lacking in taste. The lettuce wrap actually wasn't bad.  A 3.  Pull your lettuce wrap in your hand and put their ground beef in it and bite.  Get this if you come here.  Spencer thinks lettuce wraps are just an American version of Thai Larp.  He's probably right.  This dish pretty much is that except without any of the spiciness.   The BBQ chicken pizza, meh.  Not great.  Slightly thin crust but without the crunchiness you expect from a think crust.  And the pizza's kinda small.  I could eat a whole pizza by myself.  Maybe 12"" in diameter?  A 3. The salad actually wasn't bad.  I thought it had more flavor than the pizza.  A pretty decent sized salad with a good mix of greens and spinach.  If I ever come back to a CPK, I think I'll only order a salad.  What does that tell you when I go to a pizza restaurant and don't even plan to order the pizza?  Yeah, ""if I ever come back"".  Probably won't unless invited.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach?start=140

Pete C.,"Los Alamitos, CA",85,286,82,3.0,12/28/2010,As they go this CPK is  a notch above the others that I have visited. I think what makes it different is that the service is very good. The food itself is very consistent with other California Pizza Kitchens. It is a very decent pizza at a reasonable price with a menu that should keep everyone in the family happy.  I normally have lunch here and they seem to turn the tables quickly enough to seat you within a reasonable amount of time. The only drawback that I would give this location is that Parking can tend to be a pain and Manhattan Beach drivers always seem to be in a rush but that isn't the restaurant's fault.  All in all a solid three star A-OK rating and a decent place for lunch.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach?start=180
Marissa A.,"Inglewood, CA",4,9,,2.0,11/7/2014,"Honestly if you can avoid this place. I ordered just an ordinary pepperoni pizza to go. I placed my order, 15 minutes later I went in and picked up. I love the complimentary bread and rosemary garlic dipping oil however after I ate the pizza about 30 minutes of it settling I completely puked. I tried to take the excess oil off my pizza with a napkin but I guess still it was not enough that made me sick. The pizza had about 5 pepperoni's on 5 slices. Skimp rosemary. One thing they were heavy handed with was the grease. Ugh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach?start=180
The Critic C.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",0,26,,5.0,6/17/2013,"We visit this neighborhood CPK at least twice a month.  The food is reliably good, our kids always eat well and I think it's a good value.  We went in for dinner on 6/13.  It was busy, as it usually is, so when the host said the wait time would be 15 minutes, we knew that it would probably be less.  At the 15 minute mark, I started making eye contact with the host to make sure he knew that we were still waiting.  After 30 minutes, I approached the desk to see where we were on the list.  I found that he had accidentally gone on to the new waitlist leaving mine on the old one.  No worries- people make mistakes.  He didn't apologize, however, and when I told him that we were waiting for over 30 minutes, he still did not apologize and said that they were busy.  He brushed us off!  We asked to speak to a manager. Here's where the 5 star review comes in.  While the dining experience was closer to a 3, John turned it into a 5+ experience.  He apologized on behalf of his host right away, and had us laughing within minutes.  I kept my eye on him throughout the night, and I really enjoyed the way he interacted with his guests.  He was chatting, laughing and even giving hugs.  I walked away feeling as though I had received a lesson on how to be more forgiving and how important it is to be a great communicator.  Our CPK is so lucky to have John.  We will definitely be back...and our salad and pizza were yummy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach?start=180

I was even more shocked that for a Saturday afternoon around 1pm the place was not jammed. I was meeting my cousin's here for lunch expecting to have a 30 minute wait but walked in to an almost empty restaurant. The looks more fancy with fancier selections from previous years. I almost always go with a pizza there but this time I opted for a 3 cheese ravioli type dish.  This is usually playing with fire when you try a dish at a place where they generally do not specialize in pasta. The dish was actually pretty good and cheesy, just how I like my ravioli.  My cousin's wife ordered a sandwich and wanted some mustard. I almost fell out of my chair when the server said they no longer carry it. WHAT? Don't people put mustard on their sandwiches? At least I do, but I could not understand the lack of reason behind the discontinuation of it.   I had a good experience but it is CPK after all, nothing that will entirely blow you away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach?start=180

Jon W.,"San Pedro, CA",128,118,48,5.0,8/4/2011,"This California Pizza Kitchen is fantastic.  Ian and I have eaten here 50 times at least.  When he went to American Martyrs, I would pick him up every Tuesday and we would eat lunch here.  Generally it was not crowded--2:30 PM--and we could sit in the empty side where it was quiet and Ian Could study.  This went on for over five years.  We always got great food at a great price.  Ian went through several different food moods at California Pizza Kitchen.  Spaghetti, cheese pizza, ice cream brownie are some of Ian's favorites.   There are two very special events which took place at this California Pizza Kitchen.  First, there was a wonderful lady who worked there for several years, and her name was Joy.  She took an interest in both Ian and I.  She would always ask Ian about soccer, school, and his interests.  She hugged us every time we came after a short while.  Ian called her Auntie Joy.  Her name reflects what she brought into our lives.  If you read this someday ""We love you joy!!!""  She moved on to management, and I certainly understand why. The second facilitate by Joy.  Usually I was so busy with Ian's stuff when we entered the restaurant, that I did not pay too much attention to my surroundings.  This particular day we sat facing the door.  Joy came up and was her usual self.  She leaned over and said...""Kobe Bryan is behind you. ""I laughed politely, and she said ""Really.""  It was Kobe.  Ian asked to get his autograph as he was leaving.  Kobe reached out his hand and shook both Ian and mine.  He was really nice.  I could not believe how tall he is and how large his hands were.  He signed a California Pizza Kitchen napkin and gave it to Ian.

I sat at the bar both times to watch the game...Kim was the bartender once, and Jose the second time. Both of them were great - fast, accurate and attentive without making me feel guilty for spending a little longer than I usually would in the chair to watch the game.  I ordered a custom pizza the first time, and the 5cheese with tomato the second time. Both pizzas were made right, came out fairly fast, and tasted great. I ordered a wedge salad for an appetizer both times... It was better on Tuesday than on Thursday. The Tuesday salad looked and tasted fresher. On Thursday I also ordered the sweet corn guacamole. It was very tasty, but the serving size was pretty small - looked like about 3/4 of a cup. Order two of these if you want to share with someone.

Susie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,13,1,1.0,2/20/2015,"CHECK YOUR BANK ACCOUNT STATEMENTS after you go to this restaurant!!!!!  On 1/22 my 3 friends and I went to this location (Manhatten Beach) as we have gone several times in the past. Dinner was good, everything seemed fine. When the bill came, we split the amount 4 ways, the total for us all was $35 per person (which included tax & tip) 2 paid cash while the other two of us paid with our debit. I told the waiter to charge the two cards $35 each, the rest was cash and the change was his tip (20% because he seemed nice). He did that (So at least we thought). We left the restaurant everything was fine. Come a week later when I noticed on my bank account that I was charged $40. I called my friend who also had paid with a CC and the same thing happened to her. On January 30th, she called the restaurant and the manager, Walter Hastey, sure enough found the receipt. He emailed them to her for confirmation and we found out that not only had the waiter changed the amount, he had re-printed the receipt, and signed it as well! That was an extra $10 for our order plus committed forgery by signing our names! The manager, Walter Hastey, acknowledge the error to my friend and said that ""the conversation with the waiter was going to be awkward"" What about the customer who he committed fraud too??? Isn't that more awkward?? Yes it was only $5 each, but HE REPRINTED AND SIGNED OUR NAMES!!!!  How many times has this guy done it to customers before??????? He also said he would give both my friend and I a $30 Gift Card each for what we went through. Later that morning, I called the CPK Corporate offices (310-342-5000) to let them know what was going on at their establishment in Manhatten Beach, which I had to leave a message...twice!I received NO call back so later that evening I called the same manager , Walter Hastey, of restaurant my friend had spoken to, to ask what the outcome of the waiter was. At first he was NOT apologetic at all, he sounded bothered that I had called and he acknowledged that corporate had re routed the message to him. Keep in mind, I was one of the victims and he had never spoken to me before. When I told him it felt worse that I'm calling about the situation and he sounded bothered, he then changed his voice to sound like it mattered. He also told me that he was trying to make it right by sending us the gift cards like he told my friend(which he said would be put in the mail that night). He asked for my personal info so he can send mine directly to me (which now I dread giving it to him!) Well as of now, neither one of us has received anything! I'm not even sure to be honest that the waiter has been let go. he probably just got moved to another location! All I can say CHECK YOUR STATEMENTS FOR ANY PREVIOUS DINNING EXPERIENCES HERE! And as you can see, if there is any issues with CPK, neither the management nor corporate takes it seriously! GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE GUYS! I will be happily posting this to all CPK close to the area just incase the waiter was just moved to another restaurant location to make people aware of your company's business values and not let this happen to someone else again. CPK needs to teach their management that simple follow through will always help keep unsatisfied customers coming back.

Initially, our waitress ""Eileen"" (we looked on the receipt for her name since she didn't even introduce herself) seemed prompt and very professional.  But I noticed that we were treated slightly different than the other patrons around us.  We ordered our drinks and an appetizer.  It wasn't until almost 20 minutes later that she came to take our order.  We watched as she passed by our table TWICE to cater to the other 2 parties and did not look my way once.  How do I know?  I was was looking at her, waiting for her to make eye contact with me.  We finally got our food, but a different waitress served our food and that was when I had to ask HER for a refill on my drink.  The food wasn't even piping hot anymore, it was warm.   We watched another family get seated next to us and ""Eileen"" took their order immediately.  I watched and ate in silence as she came back at least TWICE to ask the other party if everything was okay.  Not once did she stop by our table to ask us.  SMH.  Seriously??  I'm glad I am not in the are often...even in the ""hood"", I've gotten better treatment and better customer service. CPK, I don't know what's up with the service but I was very disappointed.  After reading the other reviews, it looks like this isn't an isolated incident.  My BF and I are typically generous tippers when it comes to eating out.  We always give at least 20%, but not today for CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach?start=120

One of my girlfriends and I have been to this location two times this past week and had the BEST experience with both waiters. First we had Tony and then we had Steve. They are both exceptional servers and really ensure that their patrons get everything they need and are enjoying their meal. Extremely attentive and always checking back to make sure everything is ok and if anything is needed-- but they also did it in a way that wasn't too much (bc lets be honest this happens too..

I was like okay well at most we are talking 5 minuets after. It was so rude and I just couldn't believe the lack of going beyond for the guest. There's a different between good costumer service and GREAT costumer service. So when I get there they over charged me for what I usually get (plain pasta with sauce) so it cost over 20 dollars for pasta and side salad, and so I kindly asked to speak to a manager. I just simply and kindly stated I felt that them not bringing it out was poor service on there part. The manger stared at me like I was stupid and was not speaking English. And then stated that its a safety issue that no employees were able to leave the restaurant after 9:30. And that if I was more clear on being pregnant he would of brought it out. Completely blaming me. And the look on his face and tone of his voice was so condescending I almost died. It was 5 minuets after 9:30 and I was like so if I came at 9:29 you would bring it out? I work in a restaurant and times are always subject to change because guest always come first. I also worked for a CPK and I don't remember it being this poorly ran.

After she left our server came over and he joked with us, made us laugh, gave us tips. Exactly what you would want. I even noticed the manager walking around talking to people, taking the time.  We ordered the mac and cheese deep fried which was delicious. Our server kept encouraging us to lick the plate. Then we had the original bbq chicken pizza which never disappoints.

On the $30 deal menu it lists for entree ""Kung pao spaghetti (with chicken)"" I don't know about you, but that implies it comes with chicken for me! We ordered two kung paos, one with shrimp instead of chicken.   We got a shrimp kung pao and one with no meat! We asked the server, and she said it doesn't come with chicken unless we ask for it in an ""it's your fault""  tone. Seriously? Anyone would assume that it came with chicken.

I had the grilled peach salad with added shrimp and peach iced tea.  I was happy to see this on the menu as this is something that the bf and I have made at home with grilled steak (Mens Health, low-carb/ab recipe).  We shared their spinach dip and we both agreed that it was a little too watery and the chips were slightly stale.  I suspect that they leave them in an open bin and the air softens them.   Our waiter (can't recall his name) was very friendly and checked on us quite frequently. My star deduction comes from their dish-washing.  The wine glass that was already on the table had something green stuck to it and my bread plate sitting on the table had something brown stuck to it.  Yuck!  While leaving items on the table helps with set up turnaround, it also leads to dirty dishes that are prone to catch flying food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach?start=160

They top it with chopped BBQ chicken breast, diced tomatoes and scallions.  It's a great salad.  They serve you bread and butter to complement your meal.  In fact, if you are dining with somebody, the secret is to order the full plate and split it with your dining partner.  You get the same quantity but you save money verses ordering two half plate salads separately. The ambience is bright and festive and it can get really crowded around noon during the work week so it's best to get there between 11:00 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. if you don't want to wait 20-30 minutes.  They also have a patio out back for dining on those warm, sunny days!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach?start=200

They've also hiked up their prices the past few years, but the quality is about the same. But, that aside, I do enjoy their pasta every now and then. It satisfies the craving. We came here for an impromptu dinner after shopping at the mall. I was already disgruntled by the craptastic service at the Apple store (see review below), plus I was starving. If you know females at all, you should know that's a deadly combination... I particularly find my inner bitch when I'm hungry too. So we trot across the street to CPK for some pasta. It was kinda crowded inside, but we only had to wait about 10 minutes. After the seating host proceeded to get into a mini tift with what looked like the manager, we were seated and I was excited for some food. Our waiter did not seem terribly busy to be honest, yet he was not attentive at all. He forgot my iced tea, only to remember about 50 minutes into the meal... which by the way, did not come out until almost an hour later. An hour to make fettuccine alfredo and spaghetti? I don't think so. We did not get refills on our drink, did not get asked how the food was, received no apologies for waiting so long for the food. When the check finally came and we put our payment in it, our waiter walked right by our table at least three times before finally picking it up. I watched him too, the man was chilling at a register station with another waitress just talking. I overheard the people seated behind me complaining to each other about the service too. I don't really know what's going on at this branch, but I've never received such poor service at a CPK before.

I asked the server why it was taking so long and she said that she was not informed.  The manager (which I'm assuming since she was not wearing a uniform) reiterated that she was not told.  But then what's the point of me calling to ask for curbside delivery upon arrival? Manager then condescendingly explains that the phone is picked up by everyone in the restaurant and not just the take out counter, and the person who picked up originally did not inform the take out counter.  Then why would the phone system have a number to press to indicate that you are there for curbside delivery? That seems very inefficient.  Either way, someone in the restaurant screwed up and a sincere apology from either the server or manager would have sufficed, rather than not taking any accountability for wasting my time.

Marc S.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,134,53,3.0,10/3/2007,"Being from NY there's just certain things that don't belong on a pizza, namely, chicken, lettuce, walnuts, carrots, thai food... pretty much most of the weird combinations that CPK concocts. If any pizzeria served up a pie with Asian food thrown on top I think the chef would get his kneecaps broken. Don't get me wrong I love Asian food, just not on my pizza. Yah dig? Aside from this bizarre stuff, CPK's normal pies ain't half bad. I would certainly eat it any day of the week over Pizza Hut. I do find the Sweet Sausage and Onions pizza pretty acceptable, as is the Pepperoni, Mushrooms and Sausage. The Neapolitan also goes down pretty steadily too. They have a nice variety of salads too that go befittingly with the pizza. Have not tried any of the pasta dishes though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach?start=220
Meryl G.,"Redondo Beach, CA",16,34,,5.0,6/16/2010,LOVE the bbq chicken chopped salad!  Had a great dinner there last week with a large group of friends from work and had excellent service!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach?start=220
Jessica E.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,5.0,7/31/2011,We were seated quickly yet we waited about 10 minutes for a server. The server was very apologetic and offered a free dessert or appetizer. We chose an appetizer.  The manager came and apologized to us as well. The server was consistent with our refills as well as our satisfaction.  The food was tasty and the service was great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach?start=220
Aaron D.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",16,101,29,3.0,5/19/2010,My coworkers turned me on to this place. I've had the BBQ Chicken Pizza & the Meat Lovers Pizza. Both are pretty good but that meat lovers is straight up heart attack bait.......................joking of course. The prices are fair too. You can get your drink on there too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach?start=220
Samantha S.,"Brooklyn, NY",219,139,1,5.0,10/7/2008,I eat the Waldorf Salad with Balsamic Vinagrette at LEAST 4 times a week when at work. This is my FAVORITE meal. Ever. I think the employees here know me by name. If you havent tried this salad you must!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach?start=220
Steve T.,"Jacksonville, FL",171,59,1,2.0,7/24/2008,"I don't understand why CPK is 4 stars at the time of this writing. The food is okay. Nothing spectacular nor worth writing home about. I usually get the tried and true BBQ chicken pizza. Or the Korean BBQ Beef Pizza (not bad! Interesting on a pizza for sure).  But for the price? Not a chance. There are so many places I'd rather go to if I had to pay $15 (tax + tip included in that number) for lunch. On the bright side, it's clean, the staff is friendly, the food comes in a reasonable amount of time, and it's never too crowded.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach?start=220
Jody S.,"Sacramento, CA",9,1328,,3.0,7/4/2009,"Waldorf salad without celery and with fat free balsamic vinagerette is good with bleu cheese candied walnuts grapes,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach?start=220
Johnnie J.,"Palo Alto, CA",18,49,,4.0,8/8/2007,"I use to frequent this place a lot when I was a young child.  I first had CPK at Stephen Wynn's newest Las Vegas Hotel at the time, The Mirage.  My parents and I were hooked!   At the time, there weren't too many CPK's in California.  This location was the closet one to us.  Only 10 miles away, yet 30 minutes to commute because of crazy PCH! Back in the day, I was able to eat a full Chinese Chicken Salad, several pieces of bread, a few glasses of Lemonade and and and a shrimp marsala in marinara sauce.  Let's say this kept me full for the next couple hours until I needed to eat my next meal! Service is fast here!  The waiters are not overwhelmed with several tables on their shift.  Food arrival is perfectly timed and you're not rushed to leave upon finishing your main meal. I don't eat here as much anymore since there's a CPK near one of my favorite movie theatres!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach?start=260
Allan I.,"Dallas, TX",4,15,,4.0,12/24/2007,"We eat here every so often, because it's a somewhat trendy place to eat, the staff is pretty friendly and we like the food.  The prices are a bit on the high side for what you get, however.  The wait can also get pretty long--easily 20 minutes for lunch or dinner.  My favorite is the Sicilian pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach?start=260
