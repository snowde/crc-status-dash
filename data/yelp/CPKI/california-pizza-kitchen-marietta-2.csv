Sheryl G.,"Roswell, GA",1,25,,5.0,5/18/2015,Went to CPK last night for a meeting. It was nice because they did not rush us at all. 4 out of the 5 of us ordered salads and were pleased. They kept refilling our drinks and brought us extra bread without us asking. Excellent service!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2?start=20
Kat M.,"Acworth, GA",41,34,34,2.0,12/28/2012,"First disappointment was the beer special-most specials that i have seen are drought beer-not bottle. Second, there were several tables had yet to be cleared off. now mind you, its 4:30 ish, they have maybe 10 tables filled-so its slow. It makes the establishment look dirty right off the bat. Third when the menus get to our table, they have food dried/stuck to them. After all that I didn't want to stay, but my husband asked me to. Service was very slow, ppl/staff everywhere, but I guess they had no direction. Our server was very nice, just slow, and not consistent, I got water, but not my husband.  Once the food arrived, it was good, not great- I wont go back this branch of C.P.K.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2?start=20
Marie M.,"Atlanta, GA",206,214,37,2.0,12/2/2012,"Our server was courteous but didn't seem too interested in serving us. Unfortunately, the food was sub par. The Kids Cheese Pizza that I got for both of my daughters had a really strange flavor. MY guess is that it was frozen out of the box pizza. My Chicken Tequila Fettuccine was kind of cold when they brought it to me and it grew even colder by the time I ate it since I had to ask the server first for Parmesan and then for pepper. Neither one which she offered first hand and it wasn't on the table either. The pumpkin cheesecake took longer than the entrees and the cinnamon flavor over the pumpkin was SO overpowering, that we could not finish it. It was my first time at CPK and I had real high hopes, unfortunately, I was highly disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2?start=20
Fletch F.,"Marietta, GA",0,73,4,4.0,1/3/2015,"Consistent, good food and service. Little pricey for what you get, but always a good trip out for family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2?start=20
Sarah T.,"Atlanta, GA",119,117,26,4.0,12/12/2011,Came with a group of 12 on Sunday night & each of us had a really great experience. This was mostly due to the excellent service we received. Our Server was on-point; and having worked for many years in the service industry I know what it's like to balance a big table with separate checks on a busy night. She didn't miss beat.  The highlight of the food/drink was definitely the frozen lemonade with a double shot of absolut. The bartender gave me the left-overs from the blender in a separate glass. It lasted me the whole night! The fried mac & cheese was also delicious.  The pasta entrees all-around could've been stronger. I think I make better pasta dishes in my own kitchen; but they were eatable. Their pizza is always good. Overpriced but good.  We had a really great time! Thank you!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2?start=20
Dina S.,"Marietta, GA",20,84,135,5.0,9/8/2012,"Consistently yummy!  The salads, soups, pastas and PIZZAS are always terrific.  This branch was a bit sleepy during our lunch visit, but the food was very good.  Love the BBQ chicken pizza!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2?start=20
Greg C.,"Marietta, GA",26,74,5,5.0,1/13/2014,"At the last minute my wife and I decided to try CPK, had only been there once before. Twenty minute wait but two seats came open at the bar.

Gabriel B.,"Los Altos, CA",12,51,50,2.0,1/5/2014,"Once a haven for the 'not quite sure what I want, but I know I will get something there', CPK went downhill lately. Despite the much welcomed shift to coke beverages (who in their right minds likes pepsi anyway??) the menu has shrinked and so did the food and service quality. Even classics like the pioneer bbq pizza chicken or the kung pao are to be found better elsewhere. Management? New owner? Slackness? Wherever the reason, unfortunately it became the place of 'not quite sure what I want, but sure wont be there'.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2?start=20
David L.,"Marietta, GA",0,5,,2.0,5/3/2014,"It had been about 6 months since we had been in there.   To sum up our experience: Bread that came with oil was the size of a pastry roll. Kids pizza was smaller and thinner than in past experiences. Fish tacos weren't enough food to justify the $12. Should have been 3 tacos and not just 2. Salad didn't taste as good as before. Though I'm not sure, I don't think the meat was as significant than before. Overall, if I had to guess, someone got into cost-cutting mode and decided they thought they could reduce portions and quality and no one would notice.   This is an expensive place compared.  I won't make a mistake of going there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2?start=20
Laura M.,"Marietta, GA",27,39,18,4.0,12/5/2013,"Solid consistent performance from a favorite chain restaurant. This is not a typical pizza joint if thats what you are looking for. It's got BLT pizza, barbeque chicken, thai peanut chicken pizza and so on. Salads are great. Decent wine selection .Service is good.  Can feel like a chuck e cheese on fri and sat nights. Lots of kids and permissive parents - it can drive me buggy. But we like the food so now we go on a week night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2?start=20
Paul M.,"Fairhope, AL",96,323,110,5.0,4/30/2013,"The service in this place is over the top. They do a great job everytime and the food is wonderful.  Seriously for a place that is a chain restaurant they have a great menu.  The pizza is in their name but try their salads. Or the small bites Crispy Mac and Cheese.  The Avocado Club Egg Rolls are great to share or have as a meal.  My mom comes here all the time and I love this place for lunch or dinner or for take out!  You can get a meat lovers pizza or the Grilled Veggie Sandwich with a salad.  Go healthy or eat something bad for you like the Jambalaya. Either way you will love the food and if you don't have a good experience with the staff, I will be very surprised!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2?start=20
Caitlin L.,"Atlanta, GA",191,300,8,2.0,9/12/2010,"We almost got up and left. Seriously.  My boyfriend and I came here on a Friday night and were seated on the patio. We waited a good bit for our server to greet us and bring us drinks. Eventually we ordered our food, I went with a cup of their asparagus soup and the Mediterranean small plate, and my boyfriend got the pear and gorgonzola pizza. I would estimate that we waited approximately 30-45 minutes for our food to come out. Every aspect of my meal was premade and simply had to be thrown on a plate, and my boyfriends meal was a pizza, their specialty.  As we waited we took notice of the 1 server that was on the patio and how rushed she was, the minimal help from the manager, and zero food runners. I told my boyfriend after our extensive wait, that come 9:05 we were leaving. Our food arrived on our table at 9:03. Our server ended up telling us how sorry she was for the wait and that they didn't have any runners and were short on staff. I appreciated her apologizing for the awful service, and I know she was stuck in the sucky situation, but her manager should have been giving her a hand, at least running food for her. Oh and as for the food: The soup was less than yummy. The Mediterranean plate was really good, but make sure you get something with it if you have it as an entree since it's met to spit as an app. And of course my boyfriend loved his pizza, one of their best pizzas in our opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2?start=20
Jon D.,"Marietta, GA",1,5,,4.0,12/28/2012,Great service and food. It's like having an brand name food ofcouse it's good,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2?start=20
David B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,80,,1.0,4/23/2011,"Hello??  Can we ever get the order correct??  Apparently if you order anything on whole wheat they can't remember the correct crust.  I've been here several times and ordered whole wheat crust only to have the server tell me ""yes, that's whole wheat"" when it clearly was not.  The management would confirm the order was wrong.   So I finally just gave up and go to YOUR PIE over in Roswell.  Better pizza anyway.  And YES, they have whole wheat and gluten free crusts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2?start=20
P R.,"Marietta, GA",1,540,12,4.0,2/18/2011,"We've been here several times, yes it's a chain, yes it's more expense than some, but the pizza is still better than most of the pizza in East Cobb.  The ingredients are always fresh and the pizzas are properly cooked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2?start=20
Robert C.,"Marietta, GA",15,29,8,3.0,1/4/2011,Good food but the waiters are not really interested in the people who came to dinner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2?start=20
Ken L.,"Marietta, GA",0,23,1,1.0,1/5/2009,"How can you possibly ruin pizza if it's in your name? CPK can manage it - dry and extra crispy. Another bust restaurant in East Cobb.

Shira D.,"Marietta, GA",413,65,48,5.0,9/3/2016,"I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. I hadn't been in here in a long while and met some family here for dinner last night.  Arlene, or waitress was friendly, and what I presumed to be a manager stopped at our table to say hi as well. Everyone was very friendly. We started out with the spinach and artichoke dip, and it came out hot! Yay!  We then shared two salads and two pizzas. All were good! We had no complaints at the table which is rare for my family.  We will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2
Kevin T.,"Marietta, GA",1,8,1,3.0,7/23/2017,we eat here about 2 times a month. the food is good. the restaraunts however is showing a lack of care. the table top in my booth was gummy. the finish was sticky and easily came up with you fingernail. my seat and several others I saw are split open. time to invest in a seating rehab....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2
Robyn C.,"Smyrna, GA",40,64,76,4.0,12/6/2016,"Prompt service! Impeccable wine list! Super cheerful customer service! I'm not sure why the reviews and stars say otherwise . Parking is great and easy.

Ashley J.,"Alpharetta, GA",108,143,1179,4.0,6/27/2016,So this is what I have found with CPK...stick to the pizza! Every time I order a pizza...I have a great visit. When I stray and order something else...I'm typically disappointed.  This time we ordered chips with spinach and artichoke dip to start. It was okay...but not great. I would skip on this next time.  The pizza...we ordered a spicy chicken chipotle pizza--WOW--it was so good! Very flavorful!  I also ordered the sangria flight--perfect for a warm summer night!  This particular location had good service and I would stop by here if I am in the area again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2
Richard L B.,"Tampa, FL",466,150,426,4.0,10/12/2016,"Had the pizza duo. Pepperoni pizza, baked potato soup. The soup was great. Rich and creamy, had lots of FLAVORS.   Pizza crust was delicious. Sauce was good and right amount of cheese for me. Cofer was my Server. He did a good job. Just needs to be a little more friendly.  No smiles. Notice the only one in the place with a smile was either the chef or manager. She came to my table for a visit twice, once to check on me and once to fill my tea. The gentleman at the front door might have been a manager not sure. Older gentlemen with glasses.  Very nice, friendly and polite. I will come back just because of his hospitality and the chef. They both made my visit great.  My table and  some other ones from what I could see needed some TLC. I sat near the take out doorway.  Will be back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2
Jillian N.,"Marietta, GA",22,9,,2.0,11/7/2017,"This East Cobb location has been slowly going down hill for the past year.  The service is slow, the booth is often not completely clean when we are seated and the quality of the food gets worse with every visit.  Today I ordered fish tacos and the ""lightly breaded"" fish inside was so tough I could not bite through it.  My son's BB chicken pizza was black on the bottom- completely burned.  We could not eat our meal and we were not charged for the food, but they charged us for our drinks, which we didn't even finish. So I paid $8.00 for a coke and lemonade got no lunch, and wasted over 40 minutes of my time. The manager that ""helped"" us acted miffed that someone was complaining about the food.  Sad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2
Jim R.,"Wexford, PA",0,1,,1.0,8/23/2017,Awful service. Mediocre food. High prices. Others in place also were complain about service. No visible manager or management.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2
Natifa S.,"Marietta, GA",169,14,4,3.0,3/23/2017,I came in for a salad for take out and the waitress was sweet however I'm pregnant and the lady that order her food after me got her food first I didn't mind that what irked we was I ordered a drink and did not receive my drink before the lady received her food. I did not like how the waitress took care of her before me. Clean and nice place but service should be better,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2
Daralynn L.,"Marietta, GA",56,198,33,4.0,6/30/2015,"I would have given this place five stars if my toppings hadn't completely fallen off of my Thai chicken  pizza, which is my favorite pizza @ CPK. Its as if it was just sat on top and brought out to me. Its never happened before. However it was good.  The next important thing I want to address is my daughter which is gluten free. She ordered from the ( nervously) GF menu. She ordered a pizza, but I forgot what type. After we received our food a waitress or manager came out voluntarily and assured my daughter her pizza was safe for her to eat. She explained how the kitchen is divided for GF preparation to avoid cross contamination.  We really appreciated the extra step to come out and reassure us. We will eat here again. I hope this review is for the CPK, right off of Roswell Road on  Johnson Ferry Road in Marietta.  My daughter has a serious issue with food allergies and most places where we attempt to eat aren't as accommodating. Before we found out her issue, we accrued thousands in medical bills, as well as pain and suffering.  I like to eat any place that will accommodate anyone with a food allergy. We will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2

Minnie M.,"Roswell, GA",0,3,,2.0,5/13/2017,We were one of two tables occupied in the restaurant.  It was middle afternoon on a Saturday.  All of the servers were eating in the restaurant at tables.  After they ate their lunch several just stayed at the tables looking at their phones.  The server we had had a very arrogant attitude and the food took a very long time to get.  The server didn't automatically check on us and refill our waters. The food was good though.  I was really disappointed in the unprofessional atmosphere and uncaring attitude in this location.  The other locations are SO MUCH BETTER at being customer oriented and professional.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2
Chad C.,"Marietta, GA",45,42,56,4.0,6/25/2016,"Food was good and the drinks were not bad either. We actually made a reservation, so when we arrive we walked in and were seated. No waiting for us!

Ava V.,"Marietta, GA",0,6,,1.0,9/4/2016,The service was so terrible tonight . They served everyone around us that came later. They didn't put chicken in my Barbecue chicken salad.

Terrible !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2
Tiffany Y.,"Marietta, GA",213,239,472,2.0,3/14/2014,"When they took the Greek pizza off the menu... I thought the world was coming to an end.  When they got rid of their shrimp appetizer my mother enjoyed so much... I thought I was going to have to learn how to make it so she would calm down...  I just don't understand why they would take some of their most popular items off the menu and also rearrange what comes on which crusts... I'm not a fan of their super thin crust pizza like most folks....my mother included.  So the tostada pizza which use to be on the original crust was moved to the thin crust and I have to ask for it on the original crust....  Now this shouldn't be a big deal but a previous trip I asked for it on the original crust... I was brought thin... and just the other night I got the tostada on what appeared as the original crust pizza but it was deceiving.   There was plenty of crust around the edges of the pizza... all big and fluffy and pretty good tasting but the crust under the toppings of the tostada... the black beans, cheese, dressing, and lettuce was NONEXISTENT... It was droopy, soggy, and messy-er than usual because the crust could not hold the pizza and this was not a fun eating experience.. Overall I enjoy CPK but it's inconsistent at times (pizzas not prepared right), service is also inconsistent at times, because one time I went to pick up an order and after standing at the togo counter for a long time I thought I was going to have to call the store while standing there to get some help....  But it just seems the cons outweigh the pros at this location.  I like CPK but I often put them on the back burner of food choices...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2

Benjamin T.,"Atlanta, GA",10,39,3,3.0,1/16/2015,I came here craving a calzone and when I got here discovered that they didn't have one. What pizza place doesn't have calzones on the menu? I odered the chicken tequila pasta and it turned out to be pretty good though. My main issue with this restaurant is that I believe it is over priced for a pizza spot. There are plenty other pizza places that are just as good and a fraction of the price.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marietta-2
