Brenton B.,"Playa Vista, Los Angeles, CA",281,58,13,3.0,1/11/2018,"Overall a good CPK in MDR when I need my BBQ chicken pizza kick.  CPK itself is ~4 star in my opinion with a good selection of pizzas, salads, and other delicious entrees. This location is no different as all of our items have come out consistently well prepared and to the standard we have grown accustomed to from CPK.  My only issue with this location to bring down to 3.5 stars is the significant inconsistency when it comes to service.  Several times we have been there now in which we will only see the server twice, to take order and then to deliver the bill. In the mean time, it was a struggle and we had to bother other staff members for requested items or drink refills.  Again, good place for large groups and family friendly, but would benefit from a little touch up with regards to attention to service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marina-del-rey

Here's the DL on how the night went: 6:30 Sit down at table 6:45 No waiter, no water, ask for waiter/server 6:55 Waiter finally arrives and says sorry for slow service and that a lot of things are broken. Really. 7:00Ask for bread (3 times) 7:10 Order 2 Chicken Milanese and one Garlic Cream Pasta with Chicken sauce on the side  7:40 Get lame excuse for waiter about food not being ready 7:45 Waiter says maybe chicken is done but pasta isn't because they made it wrong and had to remake 7:55 Ask for manager 8:00 Manager comes over and we tell her that our server is inefficient. Acts like she already knows and checks on food 8:10 inept server brings one chicken Milanese and two pastas. 8:15 Finally get all of the food 8:30 Not really hungry any more 8:35 Server gets big attitude 8:40 Manager comps Chicken dishes 8:45 Husband writes ""nope"" under tip...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marina-del-rey
Kyle M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,57,6,5.0,12/2/2017,"We come pretty often and have a few ""go-to's"" on the menu. Most notably we love the Chicken Tequila , Chipotle Chicken Pizza, Bolognese, Sante Fe Bowl, the Lettuce wrap appetizer, and the Baja Spring roll appetizer. Today we tried something new! My fiancée had the Smashed Chicken Meatball sandwich. The meatballs are made of a blend of chicken and sausage and  are served on a folded thin pizza. So flavorful! This is a new item on the menu and if you didn't try it you would be missing out. I had the ""Works"" pizza. This pizza has spicy sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, and green peppers. It sounds a little boring but it is fantastic. The heat from the spicy sausage is balanced well with the veggies. And the pepperoni is extremely tasty!   I would recommend sitting at the bar if you can. The service here is way better and the bartenders are very friendly! Today we had Makuba. We have had her wait on us before and she even remembered us from our last visit! She has excellent customer service, even though she was bartending by herself tonight, with a full bar of seated customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marina-del-rey
Gloria L.,"Marina del Rey, CA",70,389,1202,4.0,11/29/2017,"The California Pizza Kitchen in Marina del Rey is in a shopping center with a Ralph's, West Marine, Rainbow Health Foods, a Starbucks, See's Candy, the Counter, Sugarfish and other specialty stores. So it is always busy. There may be a bit of a wait during peak times but they have so many tables but it's usually not long. There is a huge parking lot but they share it with so many other places it can be tough getting a spot close.  I really like CPK.  My husband is not a fan (mostly because we've been there when it was busy and it's sometimes a bit loud for him) so I usually only go with friends.  Their Chopped Salad is always my go-to but they had my very favorite-their  Greek Salad (which I didn't see on the menu now though I haven't asked).  Their pizzas are wonderful also-especially since so many choices. I think anything you pick will be good.  I recommend this CPK. It has something for everybody on the menu",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marina-del-rey
Martin T.,"Baywood-Los Osos, CA",30,127,133,3.0,8/6/2017,"A quick run to Venice Beach today and back home tonight. The Marina restaurants are packed and a full parking lot means a wait. So we opted for CPK, a home town favorite. Sat immediately on the enclosed patio, the served appeared right now. Dinner order taken, soup (a vegetable market) very good. A creamy tomato base with plenty of vegetables, served piping hot I enjoyed the Tequila Chicken Spinach Linguini, I asked for the $5 shrimp add on. The flavor was mild no need for the lime with this tequila dish, I was glad I had ordered the extra shrimp the chicken portion was literally five chunks.  P ordered her usual mushroom pizza on thin crust with an alfradp sauce and a white truffle oil drizzle on the side. Nothing special here but a decent meal at a non crowded restaurant, just three stars.

Kimmy H.,"Culver City, CA",405,207,2461,1.0,1/22/2017,Lindsay as a manager you're supposed to put out fires not create one nor a hostile uncomfortable menacing environment/atmosphere. Your tone body language accusations lies and defensive behavior was absolutely uncalled for.... and your threat to call security was classic of a young inexperienced victim mentality. This was embarrassing uncomfortable outrageous and unnecessary.  Grow up and do better leave your personal emotions at the door this CPK needs work. I will give corporate a call for you.

Lily P.,"Bellevue, WA",107,48,80,4.0,5/31/2017,"Great service, great food. Have never been disappointed with a CPK yet, and I've tried them across the country (not that I'm looking for a disappointing CPK).  Tonight I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza, Wild mushroom pizza and Chipotle spicy chicken pizza,  all made in wheat bread and thin crust upon request, thanks to our generous server Liam. These portions were sufficient in dinner for five very hungry people. I also ordered the season special Watermelon mint martini and Honey bee lemonade. I couldn't get the martini in skinny, but it was super yum; even ordered a refill.    All the three pizzas were very tasty. The chipotle chicken pizza came with a cilantro lime dip that made it stand out among the three pizzas. I'd rank the bbq chicken pizza second simply for the love of bbq sauce.  On a Wednesday night, the crowd was light and we were out of there in tops an hour and fifteen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marina-del-rey
Kris L.,"San Marino, CA",218,1,,3.0,11/5/2017,"Kept me waiting even though I was ready. It wasn't too busy of a day and I felt as if I was ignored. I'll give benefit of the doubt because there might have been other reasons for the lack of immediate service.  They should tend to the needs of every individual more often instead of stopping at the same table, getting their order right even if they are halfway done with their meals. I stepped in for 15 minutes and continued to wait even when I asked for my server. I will assume the location here tends to be slower but some more effort should be put into the needs of all customers, not short stopping. Overall though the taste of CPK is fine. Had tried out their new chicken entree they were promoting and it wasn't too dry. 3 stars mainly for the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marina-del-rey

I got no explanation or apology, she just asked if I wanted to place an order there at the counter.

Rachel Q.,"Monterey Park, CA",879,1310,1923,4.0,8/1/2016,I've been to this location a few times before and most recently after a concert at Chace park. Sat at the bar and could see the chefs making pizzas and the bartender mixing drinks.  There was a big TV screen on with soccer on. Our bartender was super friendly. I wanted to try the Sangria - they had white and red and I ended up getting the flight of three which was only $10.  I tried it and the red was probably the best one.

I ordered the zucchini fettuccini, and there was more zucchini in it than there was pasta (the pasta was way undercooked too). Also, the plate they put it in is only like an inch from bottom to top, meaning you're paying 17 dollars for about 3 bites of food? NOT WORTH IT.

They recently underwent a transformation, and it was a complete upgrade! CPK now has a more upscale and trendy vibe while still staying casual and family friendly.  Today, I shared the California veggie pizza with my lunch mate and had a Thai crunch salad for myself. The pizza came first, and to my surprise, it was lukewarm -- as if it had been sitting a while. CPK usually brings its pizza still sizzling from the oven, so I was disappointed that it had been left out and cooled down.  My thai crunch salad was awesome as usual. I never go to CPK without getting this salad. I love the complex textures from the edamame, peanuts, crispy lettuce, and wontons. The dressing is light but flavorful, just the way I like it!

I went in with my two toddlers and husband for lunch.  She would skip our table and go to the white people next to us and ask if they needed anything in a polite manner but wouldn't even ask if we needed anything.  She never offered us refills or if we needed anything. She was just chatting away with her coworkers. She finally brought us the bill after 10-15 minutes of waiting for her.

Matt F.,"Menifee, CA",4,12,16,1.0,8/20/2017,My daughter and I went to this location last week it was really busy we got seated within a few minutes. I ordered the salad with the strawberries and watermelon and it was epic. She ordered the macaroni and cheese about  1/4 of the way through I saw her pulling out what looked to me like stringing cheese from her mouth but it was a piece of string.  We notified the server and he quickly apologized and offered her something else. She ordered the same and they brought her a new one.  The manager came over and apologized as well and she explained it was a piece of the chefs coat. We finished up and when we got the check they charged us full rate for everything. I would expect to at least get the macaroni and cheese comped. Not sure of their policy I paid the bill and we moved on.  I emailed corporate the next morning and told them of the situation I also said don't send me anything free I just want to know your policy on these types of things. Well I've received no answer from them whatsoever and that really bums me out. So hence the reason for the low rating.

I am not going to get into all the details except to say how it ended. The waiter took away my son's main course to box it up and never brought back the box.

Second salad was inundated with dried cranberries (why?) which was amusing since they were so stingy with the Marconi almonds -- I counted four.  And why the obviously canned beet bits?  For $11.99? Oh yes.  The dressing.  The original reason for send-back.  This time they gave the vegetable oil a ""slight"" acidity and called it ""dressing"" (notice emphasis on ""slight."")  On reflection I still can't figure out what they did to the chicken to make it so rubbery.  I wonder if they bring it in pre-made and warm it (?) as it did NOT taste freshly made.   Sigh.  Another chain restaurant bites the dust.  So sad. . .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marina-del-rey?start=20

CPKs are pretty bog standard with a good variety of pizza and American food. They just had a revamp and the place looks more open than it did before with tall bar tables at the back. Their special cocktail (it was a sangria with elderflower) was super delicious and I had a few of them. We ordered the spinach dip appetizer and the veggie roll appetizers. Spinach dip was good, quite cheesy, and the veggie egg rolls had a nice crunch to them. For lunch I split the salmon summer salad (had watermelon in it!) and the lobster flatbread. The lobster flatbread was more of an appetizer, but it had a lot of lobster on top of the flatbread so points for that. The summer salad was really good and I liked the creativity of the watermelon in it. The salmon in the salad was a bit overcooked.  I've been here before and I am going to stick with the pizzas here next time. Otherwise the rest of the food was good as usual and really enjoyed the banter with our servers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marina-del-rey?start=60

Our server, Thomas, was very nice, friendly, and attentive. We were initially seated inside, but per our request, we were able to move to an outside patio area. Loved that they were accommodating! We got the Original BBQ and the Works--both of which were good, just like at any other CPK.

My four year old son was soooooo hungry at this point. It was a sad sight to experience my son so hungry. My 4 month old baby had napped and before the food even came woke up so I of course didn't even get to enjoy my food. Besides the point it took years for husband to get the dressing for his salad. He was almost done with it before it finally came and we asked our server for it three times and finally asked someone else. Soooo horrible. Never coming here again.

There's a little bottom annex area with tables and booths that is separated from what I assume is the main dining area - the annex is where I was seated. It was beautiful and well lit, but the waiter in charge of our table looked like he was struggling to attend to the people sitting above us in the main dining area and us at the same time, as he had to go around a long wall.  First off, we weren't given bread. Who does that. I come to CPK expecting bread immediately. Didn't realize this until halfway through my meal when I finally pinpointed why I was feeling empty during the initial seating.  Second of all, it took almost 15 minutes to get crushed red pepper for my pizza. I'm sorry, but there are maybe 10 occupied tables and among 4 waiters manning the floor, it took you that long to bring red pepper flakes? I was halfway done with my pizza when they finally came.  Overall, not a great experience. The pizza was standard, and my waiter wouldn't look me in the eyes or show emotion on his face.

Randoll C.,"Los Angeles, CA",584,1424,6063,3.0,2/16/2014,"For starters, anyone who has been to the plaza knows how parking can be. For those who don't - just know that you'll want to practice patience looking for parking while navigating around others who seem oblivious to the fact that they're holding up traffic and creating a log jam, in an already packed parking lot.  As for the restaurant, there's both indoor and outdoor seating. One the chillier nights, I've seen a lot of empty tables because no one want to be out in the cold when the marine layer starts creeping in. It's warmer and cozier indoors and you don't have to deal with the vehicular noise from the parking lot.  Then there's the service. On this visit, our server seemed to either be slow, or just didn't care to serve our table. I can't be sure which it was but to have to ask to be served, when I thought that's the primary function of the wait staff - just didn't calculate right for me. No follow up to check on how the dishes came out nor whether we wanted anything else. We also had to flag her down for the check after she walked by us several times, checking up on the tables around us.  The food was okay. I tried the Tequila Lime Fettucini and there definitely is a lime flavor. Too much in fact. It took away from the rest of the dish so keep that in mind and ask for less if you decided to try it yourself. If you like a heavy lime presence, then this is the dish for you. My family seemed to enjoy their orders. The only comment I heard was that the wild mushroom pizza could have used more mushroom, and possibly less cheese. I didn't try the other dishes on the table so I'll just leave it at that.  It's a chain restaurant so we should all know what to expect.

Took about 20min to get my drink, and then didn't ask what we wanted to eat. Strange. So i had to grab him when he walked by, which was seldom.

She forgot our appetizer, didn't apologize just asked if we still wanted it. We had already finished our entrees. She sat it down, it was cold.

My husband's thai pizza was abundant in peanut sauce as a base, so he was happy. It took six minutes to find our server and tell him the dish was cold.

Cindy M.,"Torrance, CA",261,169,49,3.0,11/11/2014,"Went to CPK during a weekday lunch with a few coworkers.  Appetizers For this, we ordered, artichoke dip. It came out warm with sides of chips. I quite liked it, and found I had to stop myself from eating and ruining my lunch. Entree Since they are famous for their pizza, i decided to get the white cheese pizza and added an additional topping of mushroom. I was quite pleased with it, not too crazy about the tomatoes, but it actually worked well together. It didn't overpower the plate. Portion Their pizza size is not too huge, but it will definitely fill you up, with maybe a little leftover. Sharing it may not be enough, but may work if you order an additional little side. Drinks They will refill your drinks (sodas/ ice teas/ etc). Service Out of the 6 of us, one of the order came out wrong. Our friend had to wait for about 10 minutes for his pizza to come out. He was quite patient about it, thankfully he's not the type to get hangry :) Other than that, our waiter though didn't completely ignore us, also didn't smother us with over attention. Also, the manager came a few time to make sure we are having a good dining experience.  Overall, for the price and experience, I wouldn't go back everyday, but it was a pretty good dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marina-del-rey?start=80

My boyfriend and I have become recent fans of our local CPK in San Luis Obispo so thought why not. Choices were limited that night. Same menu. I ordered a cup of the smashed pea soup which I always like and the creamy garlic fettucini with added mushrooms which was also a favorite. Unfortunately this night the dish was not up to usual par that we get in SLO. The pasta was undercooked and dish was just warm. I ate some of it..didn't complain which I should have and paid for it. My brother and mom both ordered pizzas..my brother said the carnitas pizza was great and took it home WITH the side of sauce. My mom had no complaints about her cheese pizza. I told my brother about the incredible sangrias. I usually get the flight with Blood oranged subbed in..He got the blood orange one. Loved it. I for some reason didn't get the sangrias that night. Got something else but cannot remember what it was! Oh well!

Richard R.,"Culver City, CA",88,210,1778,4.0,5/16/2014,I think I've already done a review for CPK in Manhattan Beach but the one here in Marina del Rey is the one we go to most often. These two locations are very interchangeable to us. The quality of the food and service being consistently well above average. But I think in terms of what CPK offers they get things very right. The appetizers pair very well with the entrées which pair very well with the desserts. There is enough variety in all categories that we can always find something that suits whatever mood we're in. And then maybe the most difficult thing is to not offer so many things that it makes it too difficult for someone to decide. And the same can be said for having such a large menu that it makes it too large a task for the kitchen to deliver on the consistency that we really value.

Renee S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,6,,1.0,6/7/2016,"My friend and I came in on a Sunday at about 3:00 pm. After we were seated (at a table with no silverware), we waited about 15 minutes without a waiter coming by to offer us something to drink. We had to actually pull the hostess aside and ask her to send us a waiter. Once he arrived, he took our drink orders and we asked for bread. He didn't come back with it, so we asked an additional 3 times. We also had no idea who our actual server was because we had about 3 different ones who came to deliver food and take additional orders. Aside from having no silverware at the table, we only had a vinegar bottle. There was no accompanying olive oil bottle like there was on every other table. The manager actually dropped by our table and asked if he could take our vinegar from us in the middle of our meal. Once we finally got our food (2 salads), we had to ask for silverware to eat them with. The hostess was actually the one who brought us our salads which we thought was extremely strange. By the end of the meal we were just so confused. We didn't even know who our tip was going to since we had a total of about 5 different waiters and the hostess.

We had to ask multiple times to get refill on our drinks, even when she was at our table cleaning up plates. The manager wasn't helping out either, he was helping move tables on the patio... While the server was drowning. I used to work for CPK and from how it used to be when Rick and Larry used to run it has changed dramatically, I appreciate the relaxed atmosphere but  the service shouldn't relax with it, especially if you are raising the prices. I remember how strict everything was and how the management had to do their table touches, and make sure customers were happy. And servers had to follow their 5 steps of service.  But I will say that the food is still good, the Italian chopped is amazing... however, I am not sure about all that new stuff that they are trying to push.

Michael S.,"Vancouver, WA",4480,2218,19024,3.0,8/10/2010,"By now almost all of us have been to a CPK. This one is nice because it isn't attached to a mall and has outdoor/covered seating.  I don't get to California Pizza Kitchen as often as I did when it first became a craze, but I've been a fan for a while. The pizzas are delicious and the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine (Spinach fettuccine with chicken, peppers, onions and cilantro in a tequila-lime and jalapeño cream sauce) is a killer pasta.  For pizzas, my favorites are Chipotle Chicken, Tostada, and the White Pizza. The main reason for 3 stars is that yesterday at lunch I had to have two different plates replaced because they were dirty.  The first time was annoying, but the second time it started to get a little gross. The service was reasonably fast and the waiter did a good job of bringing refills when needed. The second reason, I've knocked CPK down a notch is that yesterday I tried two items off the new small bites menu and was disappointed in both.  The Korean BBQ Steak Tacos were especially sweet (why?) and  didn't taste even as good as a Galbi taco truck.  The second small dish (the Mediterranean Plate) was just as lame because there was only about 5 small pieces of bread for the forgettable hummus and tiny greek salad.  I think next time, I'll just stick to the big boys menu.

Almost always get the same thing: bbq chicken pizza and spinach dip.  The spinach dip is creamy, cheesy and warm with tortilla chips.  Do I have to describe the BBQ chicken pizza?  It's the most popular dish they offer.  You know who comes here?

You can't go wrong with this place except for one thing......... This time around I'll start off with the negatives.... 1. Negatives: THE FUCKIN' BREAD...... Seriously, I can think of 098098203849023804 places with great bread but only one single place with shitty bread. One may be thinkin' why are you trippin'? It's just BREAD SON.... But no! Think of it this way, this is basically the first thing you eat at the restaurant unless you order an appetizer (I recommend the Sesame Ginger dumplings) but otherwise. The bread is super cold, and super hard. I've been one of those customers who has specifically asked my waiter to heat up my bread but then I found out how they do it and it's too much trouble for them so I just decided to suck it up and deal with their shitty bread.  Positives: 1. The pizza is amazing. I really really like the crush and the amazin' selections. They seriously have so many different varieties! 2. HANDS DOWN THE BEST THING TO GET WHICH IS WHAT I GET EVERY TIME IS THE CHICKEN TEQUILA FETTUCINE..... OHHH EM GEEE..... It's like an ORGASM IN YOUR MOUTH. The pasta just blends so well together. It's about 1300 CALORIES BUT WHO CARES? I always get diced tomatoes to give it some more ""Umph"" But seriously kids. This is the real deal. They have good pastas like the Kung Pao Pasta and the regular Creme sauce but the Chicken Tequila Fettucine is like the IN-N-OUT of Hamburgers.

Allie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,77,141,2.0,4/15/2012,"My friend got me to enter a chain restaurant! Ahhhh! The food: Tortilla ""spring rolls"" - Basically rolled quesadillas with too much cheese. The difference between the three flavors was overpowered by the cheese. I don't get how these are spring rolls in any context... Decent quesadillas. Avocado club egg rolls - Weird hybrid of a BLT sandwich stuffed inside wonton wrappers. Not a big fan of deep fried avocados -- a bit conflicting. Chopped salad - Iceberg lettuce with salami and basil! I guess they do best with simple here. Wild mushroom pizza - Generous amount of four different types of mushrooms. I think it desperately needs some acidity though. Marinara or pepperoncinis? Cranberry cooler - Club soda with a splash of cranberry juice. And apparently asking for just cranberry juice refill gets charged again as a separate drink. Wtf?? Atmosphere was nice, but packed with kids and college kids discussing the day's afternoon hangovers. Waiter wasn't the most attentive nor very friendly. Generically awesome. A bit overpriced as well.

I am a a vegetarian and asked for a salad with chicken on the side for the person I was dining with. They brought us a salad they clearly hand picked the chicken out of and still left shreds of chicken in it. GROSS. Makes me question how they handle their food at all. The waitress was barely apologetic and the staff clearly was inspecting it as if we were lying. I didn't receive the drink I ordered till the end of the meal, again they were unapologetic. On our pizza I asked for half mushroom and same there was sausage clearly on it which I accidentally ate. If I were a more difficult customer I would have made a scene. I just think they should REALLY be more considerate about how they are serving their food. I'm leaving utterly disappointed that no one offered to comp anything or even a discount.

After the shrimp fell and landed on the towel, he grabed them all with one hand and threw them in the box(I assumed it was for someone working there)  I saw them box it up and put it in a bag and then handed it to a lady who was at the to-go side.

Hello K.,"Los Angeles, CA",121,118,31,4.0,4/18/2009,"Along with the economy, I recently became a health education writer which really doesn't make it too fun when you are on a date in an Italian restaurant and know too much about nutrition. So if you are vegetarian or someone like me, who eats meat but feels too guilty to eat pizza, this is a good place for you. It's one of my favorite chain restaurants. I love their vegetarian selections. You can have a decent, delicious pizza with no meat. See the picture I posted? It was a delicious vegetarian pizza especially with that kind of Italian broccoli (I think that's what it was). The mushroom tasted so good. Loved it. Can't wait to try their new Pear & Gorgonzola pizza as well. Sounds yummy. Maybe it's a pizza version of their Field Greens salad with nuts, pears and greens? Seems like the chef there loves using pears with greens. I had another discontinued vegetarian Indian-pancake-like thin-crust pizza there with lots of green and pears before too I think. Works for me.  And then once in a while when I am secure enough about the idea of having lots of fat in my meal, their Chicken Tequila Fettuccine is an all-time favorite too. I have been going to the CPK opposite to California Plaza in Downtown, the one in Torrance but I like this one in Marina del Rey the best. Boyfriend and I frequently get our breakfasts and grocery in this nice big laid-back plaza near home.

The Caesar Salad looked undressed but the guy overdressed it but failed to toss it. The Asparagus salad had one Asparagus, it was totally raw and they used the whole stalk so it was like eating rope. The pasta was tasty but served at just below room temperature. I was shocked at the downturn. Now I see the chain has new owners & they are cheapening things.

The service is beyond awful. And yet, everyday, they're packed for lunch. Who are these gluttons for punishment? Why do they believe that half of a McDonald's hamburger chopped up on their pizza is worth $11.99? Why are they willing to waste an hour of their lives waiting for (yet another) new waiter to screw up their order or for the pathetic meal to arrive at their table? Who are these people? How does CPK brainwash them into making return visits? Are there subliminal messages on the TVs all around the place? I'd give them a ZERO if I could.

This was my 2nd time here... and even the first time, customer service was horrible too. My friend and I had dinner here. Our waiter Ron from Boston was horrible. He didn't check on us and we had to ask him to bring us bread. I noticed that other people were asking him the same thing too.  I'm a huge fan of their ceasar salad and always rave that they have the best ceasar, but this last time... I must say, I wasn't a fan! They didn't have the shredded cheese on it and it didn't look like the usual. I usually order the avocado rolls (which I love!) that comes with 2 sauces... and I love their chicken ceasar sandwich with garlic cheese focaccia bread. I also like their chicken alfredo and white pizza. I tired their pink lemonade and I wasn't a fan, it was tooo sweet. The focaccia bread with cheese is yummy too. I'm really upset with my last visit and plan on not going back there again. Service was really bad! The manager came by the table to ask if everything was okay...

D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",313,1306,4420,4.0,1/16/2015,"I first ate CPK in 1997 in Honolulu and was amazed at how new and different it was for a pizza chain. Back then Pizza Hut, Dominos, Little Caesars ruled the pizza universe and the times were changing. Then, over the years I've eaten it at various airport CPK Express locations and felt cheated from my first earlier impression. You see many of these California Pizza Express locations skimped on servings and served sub par less than mediocre Za.  I was left believing this chain had gone to the dogs. I do realize that CPK express in the airports were different from the sit down California Pizza Kitchens.    So we decided to have a go at this place the last night in LA as this location was near the airport. The place was packed with families and there was barely a table open. It was hopping to say the least.   We had ordered a bunch of items my brother ordered the Sicilian pizza.  My wife ordered the Thai crunch salad. I had a taste and it was a great medley of crunch, flavour and freshness. I ordered the fish tacos with avocado.  They were not the best ones I've eaten but were a solid 3.5/5.  For my daughter she got an order of mac n cheese which she was more than satisfied with.  Everything came out very well decorated an appetizing and we were extremely content with our meal. No one had complaints.  This was a surprise for me as I had negative feelings after eating all that airport cardboard pizza.  It was really a great experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marina-del-rey?start=40

The reason I'm rating this 4 Stars instead of 5 is because the wine was a bit off.  Also, their ladies room had only two stalls.  They should have made it four (4) stalls when they thought of renovating this place.  (Btw, it's a nicely renovated place kinda like the one in Woodland Hills.)

The design and simplicity of the menu was very pleasing to look at. There's a lot on the menu but it didn't feel overwhelming at all.. It was organized, clean and made ordering very easy.  As for the food, we got the spinach and artichoke pizza w chicken added. BOMB I absolutely love the crispness of the crust and the flavors balance so well. (Definitely big enough to serve 2-3 people.) We couldn't gage how hungry we were so we also ordered two cups of soup: Baked potato & Farmers Market. HOLYYY, they were so darn good. I'm a big soup fan and it really hit the spot. Baked potato is more of a subtle soup but still good flavor. The Farmers Market, though... That was my favorite!!

Rose C.,"Culver - West, CA",28,47,20,3.0,1/27/2014,"As much as I usually like CPK I feel this location does not make their food to the standard of quality I'm used to getting at CPK. I've been to locations in Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach, the CPK Express one in Redondo I think, and the Culver City one. This was the first time I ordered Thai Chicken Pizza and the White Corn Guacamole & Chips Small Plate at this location, although I've been here before and ordered other things. I order these a lot and know what they usually taste and look like. The Thai Chicken Pizza wasn't made very well, it had way too much veggies so that it overwhelmed the chicken and didn't have a balanced taste. I love vegetables so it wasn't that I dislike veggies but more the veggie/chicken/sauce ratio. The peanut sauce wasn't evenly spread, so I had bites oozing lots of sauce and bites that were very dry and sauceless. The White Corn Guac is one of my new favorites and is well executed at the Culver City location and looks just like it's picture, with lots of corn and small diced avocado and a balanced flavor. At this MDR location, instead of diced avocado it was large chunks and tasted overwhelmingly of jicama with barely any corn and also too much beans, so the flavor and texture profile was completely off. I mean seriously, how hard is it to dice something as soft as avocado. To me it just seems the kitchen staff is either extremely lazy or inexperienced because their lack of execution really shows and unfortunately made for a very rare disappointing dinner at CPK, one of my favorite restaurant chains.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marina-del-rey?start=220

Stephanie K.,"Marina del Rey, CA",103,130,263,5.0,4/25/2009,"Alright, so I am writing about California Pizza Kitchen. Yes, it's true. I say this with just a pinch of sarcasm salt, because once upon a time (before children or a.k.a. ""b.c."" ) I was a young gourmand enrolled in French Classic Cuisine classes. I took a year of French Classic cooking as well as French pastry classes. So I am a foodie.  That being said, it's no surprise that as a mom of 3 young children, I love this particular California Pizza Kitchen. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a chain. I know, I know. But when my 10 month old daughter slurps up half of my ""two in a bowl"" soup selection, and eats most of my avocado from my salad. I am a happy camper. Especially when the avocado is perfectly fresh and the soup is tasty.  Secondly, my 9 year old son gobbles up his ""regular size"" Hawaiian pizza. And my 4 year old daughter eats all her dinner as well. To top it off, the waitstaff is attentive and doesn't mind when the baby leaves a whirlwind of mess around her highchair. They compassionately keep my my glass of wine filled to the brim while being gracious and undaunted by our loud and messy table of 3 kids and 2 grown-ups. The waitstaff are calm, cool, and collected, and laugh along with us.  **To add: tonight was a stellar performance by the manager!** My son ordered his usual ""Hawaiian pizza"" which, when delivered to our table (by the manager) was announced ""overcooked a.k.a. burned a little"" so they allowed my son to eat to his heart's content while another ""new and improved"" Hawaiian pizza was delivered free of charge! Yes! You heard it! FREE PIZZA!!! Can you believe it?! Another bonus: Tonight was the first and only time I have ordered tiramisu at the California Pizza Kitchen. It was quite delicious. I have made tiramisu myself-- I even made the ladyfingers from scratch--  numerous times. I must say, the tiramisu at California Pizza Kitchen was surprisingly good. I was not expecting to actually taste the marsala, espresso, and mascarpone in layered flavors. The cake was the right consistency and all flavors married well with each other.

My wife and I went there again today for dinner. We sat at the bar and I asked for a water and my wife for a pink lemonade. When the drinks arrived my wife's glass had lipstick all around the rim and my glass had some black gooey substance sticking to the outside.

I called the restaurant some 25 minutes later to speak with their manager. I was kept on hold for over 9 minutes without anyone coming back on the line to tell me they were getting the manager.

It was cooked to perfection, and they use Chinese broccoli, which is heavenly.  If you are a Vegan, you could totally be comfortable here with the lettuce wrap (meatless version, of course). The water chestnuts give it a nice crunch, while the peanut sauce melts in your mouth. I ended the evening with an Apple Martini, perfectly sour, and perfectly chilled.

Susie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,13,1,1.0,2/20/2015,"CHECK YOUR BANK ACCOUNT STATEMENTS after you go to this restaurant!!!!!  On 1/22 my 3 friends and I went to this location (Manhatten Beach) as we have gone several times in the past. Dinner was good, everything seemed fine. When the bill came, we split the amount 4 ways, the total for us all was $35 per person (which included tax & tip) 2 paid cash while the other two of us paid with our debit. I told the waiter to charge the two cards $35 each, the rest was cash and the change was his tip (20% because he seemed nice). He did that (So at least we thought). We left the restaurant everything was fine. Come a week later when I noticed on my bank account that I was charged $40. I called my friend who also had paid with a CC and the same thing happened to her. On January 30th, she called the restaurant and the manager, Walter Hastey, sure enough found the receipt. He emailed them to her for confirmation and we found out that not only had the waiter changed the amount, he had re-printed the receipt, and signed it as well! That was an extra $10 for our order plus committed forgery by signing our names! The manager, Walter Hastey, acknowledge the error to my friend and said that ""the conversation with the waiter was going to be awkward"" What about the customer who he committed fraud too??? Isn't that more awkward?? Yes it was only $5 each, but HE REPRINTED AND SIGNED OUR NAMES!!!!  How many times has this guy done it to customers before??????? He also said he would give both my friend and I a $30 Gift Card each for what we went through. Later that morning, I called the CPK Corporate offices (310-342-5000) to let them know what was going on at their establishment in Manhatten Beach, which I had to leave a message...twice!I received NO call back so later that evening I called the same manager , Walter Hastey, of restaurant my friend had spoken to, to ask what the outcome of the waiter was. At first he was NOT apologetic at all, he sounded bothered that I had called and he acknowledged that corporate had re routed the message to him. Keep in mind, I was one of the victims and he had never spoken to me before. When I told him it felt worse that I'm calling about the situation and he sounded bothered, he then changed his voice to sound like it mattered. He also told me that he was trying to make it right by sending us the gift cards like he told my friend(which he said would be put in the mail that night). He asked for my personal info so he can send mine directly to me (which now I dread giving it to him!) Well as of now, neither one of us has received anything! I'm not even sure to be honest that the waiter has been let go. he probably just got moved to another location! All I can say CHECK YOUR STATEMENTS FOR ANY PREVIOUS DINNING EXPERIENCES HERE! And as you can see, if there is any issues with CPK, neither the management nor corporate takes it seriously! GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE GUYS! I will be happily posting this to all CPK close to the area just incase the waiter was just moved to another restaurant location to make people aware of your company's business values and not let this happen to someone else again. CPK needs to teach their management that simple follow through will always help keep unsatisfied customers coming back.

I've found a few other pizza places with gluten-free crust, but it's often not very good and I have a hard time convincing my boyfriend to split one with me. But when we tried California Pizza Kitchen's new gluten-free crust, my boyfriend liked it even more than their regular crust! It's hands-down the best gluten-free crust I've ever had. What's amazing it's it's also gluten-free certified, which is rare to find in restaurants that serve gluten at all. The staff was also very well educated on gluten and its introduction to the restaurant in addition to being friendly and great servers/managers. I should also mention their food is just excellent to begin with. But now I'll keep coming back for their pizza. As far as the location, I love this one.

This was a nice CPK on the inside, and it was extremely busy.  We had about a 20 minute wait before we were seated.  Once seated, we received pretty decent service.  My wife and I each ordered a tea, mine a regular and hers a peach.  Who knew that peach tea was 50 cents more than regular tea?  Strange, but oh well.  For our food, we each ordered a pizza.  I got the BBQ chicken with bacon, while my wife just got a standard pepperoni pizza.  The food was good.  Nothing outstanding, but certainly good.

Alan M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,,1.0,9/14/2012,"Went there for lunch at the beginning of August, 2012. The pizza was served cold, so we asked to have it heated up. Came back chewy, as if it was a day old. The rest of the meal was equally unimpressive. But it gets worse... On the way back to the car, my buddy realized he that he had left his iPhone on the table. He went back but it was gone. The people at a nearby table said that only the busboy had been by, so my friend went to the managers. They refused to bring out the busboy. It gets worse. Using ""Google's Latitude"" software and all ""Find iPhone"", I could see the phone was in the restaurant. The managers still refused to do anything other than hand out their business cards. Oh yeah... they did one other thing: They sent the busboy home. I bet he had the phone with him. My buddy contacted the Corporate office. They gave him the runaround for a month, saying their insurance company would take care of it. Finally, after ignoring all of the calls, the insurance company said that California Pizza Kitchen told them not to pay. I understand that a business can't vouch for all of its employees, but there's no excuse for not being responsible to your customers. In fact, it's disgusting. Another friend left his phone at the Island's in Marina del Rey. Not only was the phone not stolen, the manager tracked my friend down and waited after-hours for him to pick it up.

Bad service, late service, and inexcusable service considering this is supposed to be a well-oiled CHAIN restaurant.

Coming to our table twice does not equal customer service; That is your whole job purpose.

I ordered the tequila chicken pasta, which I have ordered in the past and loved!  Last night it had, literally, 8 very small pieces of chicken.  I recall the dish having much more chicken than that.  The service was underwhelming.  Maybe because we were considered a party of 8, even though three of the eight were children, and an 18% gratuity was added on whether her service was good or not.  Her service was worth 10% at the most. She acted as if she could have cared less.  Some one else brought our food and cleared our dishes. She never came back to see if we were doing okay.

Chang O.,"Los Angeles, CA",41,194,222,4.0,8/29/2009,"3.5 stars. Ditto most of what other Yelpers have written about consistency of a chain restaurant. Consistency is actually one of the hardest things to achieve for any large organization, so I am pleased to be able to rely on the consistency of food and service at CPK locations, including this one at Marina del Rey. Still, there are always some distinct characteristics that are are native to each locale and dining experience. On this visit, the service was courteous and friendly, but a tad slow. The order was accurate but the food came out a bit slow. Then the drinks took a while to get refilled, granted it was a pretty busy night. The locale is pleasant and clean in the dining room, but the men's room needed some attention. The value factor is okay. Pizzas range from about $11 to $16, which is about the same range for salads and pasta dishes. Iced tea/lemonades run about $3 or $4, which can rack up the bill pretty quickly. But the food is tasty and the quality of ingredients isn't bad, so while it isn't an outstanding bargain, it's not a bad value if you are willing to watch your drinks and desserts. One thing I noticed and liked on this visit was the diversity of the staff. Verdict: a reliable restaurant chain with friendly service, although the speed was a bit lacking on this visit.

I am not a devoted CPK fan, but if this is your bailiwick, then you'll be right at home.  You can call in an order and pick it up curbside or at the take-out counter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marina-del-rey?start=280
Charles M.,"Burlingame, CA",10,112,5,5.0,6/29/2007,"CPK is a great place to eat.  The food is very high quality and the service quick and friendly.  Every CPK is the exact same in every respect, which is good because you know you are getting good food, good service, and a nice atmosphere. If you have never had CPK before, you MUST try it at least once.  I don't know a single person who doesn't like CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marina-del-rey?start=280
Arnold S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,49,,1.0,9/14/2011,"I've been eating at CPK, since the early 1990's.  I have been to many different locations and enjoyed mostly all of them.  However now I'm starting to change my mind.  This past Sunday I visited the Marina Del Rey location and was very disappointed.  The salad (Thai Crunch) was good as usual but, everything else was horrible.  The pizza was under cooked as well as the chicken on it.  The bread was aweful, the butter was extremely hard which tore the bread in half.  And my iced tea was watered down.  And last but not least...the service was bad.  I'm really disappointed to see this restaurant that I used to like go down hill like this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marina-del-rey?start=280

Olivia L.,"Alhambra, CA",13,41,21,4.0,2/12/2009,"Since we were in the area for work, I went to CPK in Marina Del Rey with my co-worker for lunch. You can choose between the heated outdoor patio seating or regular indoor seating. They were packed either way, so we opted for the indoor seating since it was a bit chilly and windy. Their menu is gigantic, with a lot of different choices: appetizers, salads, pizzas, pastas, sandwiches and other plates. They have one full page with over 20 different pizzas. My co-worker said they have really good pizza and I did hesitate a little because I have tried a couple of restaurants in Pasadena that also have pizza in their name, and make some pretty bad pizza, but they have this chain in NYC too, so it can't be that bad. Plus, the pasta would have been too filling and I would have fallen into a food coma for the rest of the work day! I did like how there were many different topping combinations and managed to narrow down my choices to either the white pizza or the wild mushroom. Both were $11.49 I think and most of the pizzas were in the $10-$15 range. I opted for the wild mushroom pizza which had 3 types of mushroom, mozzarella and fontina, and a mushroom walnut pesto. You can add chicken, but I love mushrooms just by themselves on pizza. The pizza was a good size for one person, about 9 inches in diameter. It was thin crust style so it was not heavy. There was a lot of mushroom and pretty good flavor. My co-worker opted for the BBQ chicken pizza, which on the menu is advertised as their most popular pizza. I had never had any type of BBQ pizza and would never have thought the flavors would mesh well, but it was really good! Overall, I have to say, the pizza is pretty good for a chain store. Sadly, this is the 2nd best pizza I've had in LA thus far (yes I know, from a chain!!). The handful of other pizza joints I've tried here have been crap (with the exception of Bollini's). I did think the food was overpriced and the service was okay. I guess they were busy, but we had to flag down our waiter for refills on our drinks. At places like this (which I equate to applebee's or TGI Fridays) they usually check up on you once during the meal to see how you are doing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marina-del-rey?start=280
Antonia G.,"Irvine, CA",165,302,1,3.0,6/15/2009,"This past Saturday we went to see my Aunt who lives in West LA and had back surgery a couple weeks ago. She wanted to go to CPK so off we went. Once we got there we were seated right away and were promptly greeted by our server who quickly took our drink orders. We then proceeded to chat for awhile and decide what to order. My Mom and Aunt ordered the Moroccan chicken salad (1/2 order) which was very good but was missing the beets (my favorite). My boyfriend and I split a pesto chicken thin crust pizza and BBQ chicken salad. All were fresh and brought out quickly. Not the healthiest of lunches but it was quite good. We then walked around the shopping center which had BCBG, White House Black Market, and a couple of other cute stores. Very clean and very shoppable. All in all quite a nice day out with my Mom and Aunt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marina-del-rey?start=280

Elijah L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,13,,3.0,9/12/2010,"Someone call the popo because no one in this place knows how to drive.  People were backing up into each other left and right.   Other than the parking lot being a mess, the CPK menu is also all over the place.  Since when did the menu expand to Jerry's Deli-like proportions?  Anyways,  I was in a weird mood and tried to be ""different"", so I ordered the Gorgonzola pizza on honey wheat with pears and the fried artichoke heart appetizer.  The pizza had a salad ON TOP?  I guess I don't read carefully.  I thought it would be on the side, but nope the lettuce and dressing were covering my pizza.  Strange.  My friend was like ""It all mixes in your stomach anyways.""  Touche.  I ate it up without complaining.  Next time, I'll get a four cheese and tomato, but CPK gets points for creativity.  Also, the artichoke things were crunchy and not greasy.  Plus my friend ate his Thai bbq pizza in 3 minutes so I know he fully enjoyed his dish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marina-del-rey?start=280

Mishka K.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,10,1,1.0,3/5/2012,"If I could give this place 0 stars, I should would. Or even better, a - 5 star rating is what they deserve. Had a terrible experience when picking up a phone order. First, upon arrival was not greeted properly. After paying for our order and tipping the attendant, she said that the order will be ready shortly. 15 minutes later we were still sitting and waiting for a simple SALAD that was ordered half an hour prior our arrival over the phone. Nobody came to check on us or give us an update on the order. 20-30 min go by after the point we have been told the order will be ready shortly and I go and ask what the status is. The girl who processed the order lets me know that the salad has been taken by a waiter by mistake and that they will make a new one. SERIOUSLY?! And you couldn't come and apologize for the wait?! I ask to speak to a manger and when a lady comes and I explain the rudeness of her employee she has an even worse off attitude. What is wrong with these people?! Never eating at that place again! Didn't even offer a free appetizer or an apology for the mistake... I love CPK but this location is a major NO NO",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marina-del-rey?start=280

Limor Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/14/2012,"What a big disappointment for that location! I have been going there for years (used to be kids friendly too) and used to love to go there with my girlfriends for a light lunch with friends and family in the evening. They had a nice menu for kids. Well, it all changed on November 2011. we took our little girl there for her birthday (her request) told the hosted it was her birthday, when I noticed the our server was a little off...he did not offer a drink with the kids meal, bread was stale like it has been sitting in the refrigerator for days (I would not give it to my guests). I approached the server to let him know it is my daughter's 6th birthday...nothing...he had at least 5 people with him to sing to a table by us but only brought an ice cream for her (did not ask me what I wanted) and said ""happy birthday sweetie""... just him ....not even her name...I believe it is under new management (at least I hope that will explain it) but it was just bad. I have not been back ever since...I prefer to spend my $50.00 on other chain restaurants such as cheese cake factory where I get good service and good food. I even sent a respond to their corporate office back in November and did not hear back...oh well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marina-del-rey?start=280

I told him my order and he went back in the restaurant BUT never came back out!! I waited another 5 mins and I decided to go in and pick it up myself. The girl at the take-out counter, standing next to the guy who asked about my order at the Curb-Side parking, said it still wasn't ready 40 mins after the order.
