Rebecca M.,"Vienna, VA",390,339,279,4.0,1/6/2018,"I'm a fan of this casual quick-turn table service mall eatery!    Past the crowded counters of cheap, greasy, calorie-laden fast food eats in the Tyson's I lower food court corridor, this bastion of rustic comfort is located right by the entrance/exit doors. There's a convenient place for strollers outside the doors and plenty on booths and distressed wood table seating inside.  I don't mind grabbing food on the run and don't even mind plastic or styrofoam containers but I really prefer to dine with stainless utensils instead of plastic ones. It just makes the food taste better imho.  The pizzas, salads and pastas are quite nice and there is a M-F lunch duo for $9! But when the cold winds blow and my nose and toes are frozen, nothing warms my soul like a bowl of piping hot soup--like the rich and flavorful Sedona Tortilla offered by California Pizza Kitchen.  With a lovely vine-ripened Roma tomato base and just the right amount of chicken, corn and pepper, this soup hits the spot and chases away the chill. Add an affordable glass of wine and I'm ready to be patient enough for standing in line amid the winter mall crowds before I head back out into the Arctic Tundra that used to be the Lord and Taylor parking lot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mclean
Joela A.,"Centreville, VA",162,22,5,4.0,1/3/2018,The menu has changed a bit over the years and is constantly changing.  Lots of options and the apps can get filling so don't order too much.  BBQ chicken salad with avocado is good but I hate paying that much for a salad 15.99 plus extra for avocado  It's a big salad and can be shared.  Not the cheapest dining option at tysons but better priced than sit down restaurants.  Great for apps and meal but they need more options for dessert.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mclean
Veronica H.,"Falls Church, VA",1,15,4,2.0,12/1/2017,"This place is an overpriced wannabe! I'm not sure what they wannabe, but the food is subpar at best. I just ordered the new, short rib and Smokey Mac and cheese. For $22 I expect a little more than braised beef over a box of Kraft Mac & cheese!  I will give them credit for the tender short rib, but still not worth the price. I don't understand how they're still open. Either lower your price or step it up in the kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mclean
Zainab A.,"Ashburn, VA",78,103,106,5.0,11/20/2017,"Great place for a quick bite. My girlfriend and I stopped by after shopping. As we walked in, we were welcomed and were seated immediately. Our server was very friendly and we had a great conversation with her. They served us the complimentary bread & dipping oil. Our food came in quickly as well. It was hot and fresh. We ordered BBQ Chicken Pizza & Sedona Tortilla Soup. Both were delicious. The soup bowl was big enough to feel full. We enjoyed the food, the service, and the overall atmosphere.

I don't usually frequent chain restaurants, however it's unavoidable in Tysons and I consider CPK one of the better ones. All the restaurants are very consistent across the board. Service is always fast and friendly and the food and drink are delicious. My personal favorites are the Avocado club egg rolls and the Orchard Sangria. They also have amazing salads that even my BF will eat.

Like all cpk locations, but the food tastes good and some options are decent priced. I got the garlic cream pasta with no meat and it was about $12. It was brought out shortly after the bread was. Both it and the bread were delicious and honestly that alone could've kept me happy for a while but I had a free birthday dessert so i got a chocolate souffle cake.

Hannjoo M.,"West Covina, CA",372,94,151,3.0,8/2/2016,"I don't have any complaints about this place, but it's also not amazing or super memorable. It's just a place to go for decent food and the location is convenient if you're already at the mall anyway.  I got the California Club because I don't often see pizzas that have a lot of leafy greens AND bacon AND avocado (unless you make it yourself). I also got it on wheat crust because I'm pretending to be healthy at a pizza place. When the pizza came out it basically looked like a pizza with salad dumped on top. I picked off some of the greens with a fork before I ate the pizza because otherwise everything would just fall off as soon as I picked up a slice. The wheat crust was good considering it was wheat, and I could've eaten half of the pizza and been full. But someone challenged me to finish the whole thing so obviously I did.  Oh you also got bread and oil before your meal, so that's a plus. The service was good and again, no complaints. This is an ok place, and on the bright side there's a new Kung Fu Tea at the mall so you can go there after your meal. ^-^ If I ever come here again I will get the jambalaya fettuccini and update this review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mclean

Aarti B.,"McLean, VA",154,341,2042,5.0,12/19/2016,"Great pizza and soup! Went here with my boyfriend and we got a bowl of the new farmhouse soup and the tortilla soup - which were delicious! We weren't sure which soup to order, so they gave us a sample of each - they were both really good, so we got both! As a tip, just ask for a sample of their soup.  As for the pizza, we got their new California Veggie pizza with eggplant, broccolini, sun-dried tomatoes, caramelized unions, and goat cheese. The ingredients are fresh and pizza is made in a brick-oven. Highly recommend the pizza and soup! The Beehive sangria was good - it was a tad bit sweet. Perfect for a pool-side drink. It was a little hard to drink with my dinner, so I saved it as my dessert.  The service was good, but a bit slow. To my fair, the restaurant was busy and other servers were helping out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mclean
Alexis Y.,"沖縄県, Japan",70,2,,1.0,8/11/2017,"I would not give this CPK a star if I could, I have gone to many different CPKs with phenomenal service and excellent food. My family and I dined in this restaurant on a Friday night around 6pm, the restaurant was not busy for the time on a weekend. But this location in McLean was greatly disappointing. The waitress hardly served my table and when she did she was barely talking to us or cared about the food allergies we had. Other waiters were standing near by in a large group congregating having their own conversations and not serving other tables. By the time my family had received out orders we still had not gotten the courtesy bread when we asked three times for it, patiently waiting. As we finished our meal we asked again and another waitress was very reluctant in doing so. The original waitress never checked up on our meals or if we needed a drink refill. From previous comments and reviews about this location, other yelpers are correct about this restaurant. New management is needed followed by training for the entire staff.  We are usually large tippers in this case we hardly left a dime. It's too bad about this location, Tyson's Corner is a higher end luxury mall with a mediocre CPK.

Immediately after my first bite, I realized that my steak was cooked ""well done"". Pretty disappointed in that, but I let that pass. Unfortunately, tonight's service was not great. We had to wait about 20 minutes to find a server to give us extra napkins. It took us having to speak with the greeter to find our server.

Perhaps if I had ordered something other than the gluten free pizza, I would be able to give this CPK four or five stars. Unfortunately, the BBQ Chicken gluten free pizza was a huge disappointment. The middle was a  dry, spongy, and sweet (not in a good way) thin disc and the perimeter was completely burnt. It was like taking a really awful piece of gluten free bread (harkening back to the days of bland and oddly textured GF bread), burning it in a toaster, and then slathering BBQ sauce, cheese, and chicken on top.

Jennifer M.,"Sterling, VA",426,394,192,2.0,12/29/2010,"Overpriced, mediocre food. $7.50 for a mango mango mojito that was tasty. Too tasty. Where's the liquor in my mojito? Def not what I paid for, I didn't feel a thing... not even a little bit of heat. $13.49 for a Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Pizza. Being one of the featured pizza items on their menu, I expected it to wow me.... on the contrary, it was a sad sad pancake with toppings on a plate. This was a regular crust pizza, not a thin crust pizza. I was expecting some fresh tasting pizza dough, seeing as their oven is huge and spits out flames of bright orange fire. However, what I got was a bland-looking and boring piece of dough that tasted generic. With the toppings, it looked good... but on closer examination, there wasn't much to the toppings. They used fresh pineapple to their credit. But the pineapple and chicken were sparse. Onions were used to fill the huge empty gaps between the few chunks of chicken and pineapple. Overall a very generic pizza that was more like artwork in its clever arrangement of toppings than a satisfying food. $12-13 for a Baby Clam Linguine that I think I appreciated more than the pizza. Of the white or red sauce, we chose white. There were ample amounts of baby clams spread throughout the pasta (beware the chunks of sand/shell that may be in the clams... I bit on quite a few to my painful discovery). I appreciated that it wasn't drowned in sauce. There was a slightly smokey flavor to it that I liked. In all, good flavor to the pasta... much better than the pizza... Not a good sign for a place called California PIZZA Kitchen. On a high note, our server was really nice. Our group of 10 tipped him extra cause we liked him and he didn't even give a hint of a complaint when we asked him to split our checks.

There were enough chicken in the pesto pizza and the japanese eggplant pizza were filled with vegetarian toppings including mushrooms, eggplant, brocolli and i think it was blue cheese.

We were seated on a Friday night right away. The restaurant was pretty empty - less than 50% full. We were seated, I went to the bathroom to wash my hands, etc. and sat back down. A little less than 10 minutes passed and no one had come near us to take our order, ask us if we're ready, or see if we had any questions. They also seat us in a corner despite the various open tables. 5 more minutes pass and we still don't even have waters... There were FOUR waiters standing around talking. I can understand if they're all running around serving other tables but they were all standing there and talking.... My immediate thought was, there goes any possibility for a tip. I finally caught a worker on his way out of the kitchen(?). Freddy was nice enough to help us though I do not believe we were in his actual section. He was apologetic and nice. He brought out the bread and was quick with refills on drinks. The two stars are for Freddy, otherwise this particular CPK would get diddly squat. A young man brought my Thai crunch salad out to me. Idk who to blame for this but there was no dressing on it.... When I asked if it was coming out separately he looked confused as to why I was asking about salad dressing for my salad. I order this all the time so I know it comes with dressing, sometimes two different ones depending on which CPK I go to. I probably won't be returning to this one.

The drawback to this particular location is the mall and dealing with mall parking and mall crowds.  Even so, there was no wait for a table for 4 when we went on a Saturday evening at 6 p.m., and our food was served pretty quickly after we ordered.

They were awesome! They were totally worth crossing the river for, albeit a tad expensive ($10.99) for just two tacos and a small side of chips and salsa. Farmers & Fishers' are the same price and you get one more. I paid $1.00 more for avocado slices which I think totally make the taco - F&F don't have avocado on theirs.  My friend had the tortilla soup and grilled vegetable sandwich on focaccia bread. It was huge and it was only $9.99. It was also very tasty. I'd be tempted to get that next time, but with fish tacos on the menu...  Here's a tip: Use their Call Ahead Seating.

I was initially worried about the outcome, but they did a good job of combining and presenting the toppings.  The service is fast and the waiters are amazing! All in all it was a good experience.

(Pasta & Single Pizza) - Very friendly waiters/ waitresses - Pastas are very hardy and fulfilling (Cream Pesto Pasta)  - We got the Chicken Lettuce Wraps for an appetizer. Decent, but PF Chang's is better.  - Has a ""Small Cravings Menu"" for little proportion appetizer for less - Hummus and Nann or was it Pita Bread?... Was delicious! Cons: - OVER PRICED for what it IS (don't get that confused)... I can never agree to the bill when it comes out.. Yes, even though we are a regular.. the bill is greedy. - White Corn Guacamole off the ""Small Cravings"" Menu... is TOO small. save your 4$ or so.. I promise you.. you'll regret it BIG TIME. - Drinks were made STRONG. Boyfriend got the Ultimate Margarita. Maybe it was the 1800, but it was waaay too strong for my taste. I couldn't even down a sip.  - I got the Pina Colada (yes girly I know..) WHICH though was good, and came in a big tall glass & very cute toppings! I chose the one with raspberry puree. DEFIANTLY would NOT get the puree next time. (TOO sweet!) - Had a revisit for a brunch one day and it be ""Not so Great"" ... Slow service and took forever for the waitress to bring out our drinks.

Melinda C.,"Alexandria, VA",111,266,23,4.0,1/20/2012,"California usually equates to one thing when it comes to food, and that is avocado! To all restaurants: If California is part of the name of a menu item, and there is no avocado listed in the ingredients, your business sucks and you're running it WRONG! (I've seen this situation once). Back to California Pizza Kitchen. The only thing I've ever ordered from this establishment, and the only thing I ever will order, is the California Club: chicken, bacon, and avocado. Best combination ever. I'm pretty sure almost a whole avocado goes on this pizza, which I love, because I can never have too much avocado. I literally eat whole avocados as a snack. I just peel off the skin and munch on the thing as is. Amazing. The avocados on CPK's pizzas are always really fresh, which should be a given, but I once ordered a ""California Dream"" from a little cafe, and the avocados in the sandwich were not ripe (hard and more white than green in color). That was the biggest disappointment ever, so CPK gets extra points for having some scrumptious avocado. I often order to go because I'm usually at the mall alone and am more comfortable sitting in those tables for two in the food court area by myself rather than inside the restaurant. I find it kind of odd that when ordering to go, they put the lettuce, avocado, and tomato that should be topping the pizza in a separate container. Maybe so the lettuce doesn't get too warm on the way home? Anyway, I never actually take the to go pizza home, so this is a tad bit annoying for me. I don't want to have to spend any extra time putting the avocado on my pizza. I just want to eat it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mclean?start=100

When the waitress served the plates, she simply put a pile of plates on the table and left. I'm not sure whether that's a typical way they serve their guests. What's worse is that when I start to pass the plates around, I noticed they look dirty and even have some yellow greasy stuff  on a couple of plates. I asked the waitress and she said that's water and want to take the plates away. I told her that it's definitely not water and asked for the manager. The manager came and said he will check with chief and see what he can do, but he didn't apologize and never came back. They did give us about 25% discount I guess as a compensate when we asked for check, but I do think the manager should come back to tell us why did that happened, how they decided to deal with this and apologize for their mistakes.  I definitely won't go back to there again and wouldn't recommend anyone to there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mclean?start=100

Tiffany W.,"Washington, DC",14,57,27,3.0,9/28/2011,"CPK is a staple back home in LA, and I remember it fondly. This one in Tysons? Not too memorable. -- BBQ Chicken Pizza - a self-billed CPK original. It's always a good choice if you can't make up your mind! -- Jamaican Jerk Chicken Pizza - great if you want something peppery and sweet. The dry rub on the chicken was a bit too overpowering. -- Passion Fruit Mojito - avoid! unless you want something overly sweet and syrupy, the mint made it taste like a fruity toothpaste.  -- Caribbean Sangria - also very sweet, not very alcoholic, but it tasted like a nice fruit smoothie, which I enjoyed. The pizzas were as good as I remembered (although they didn't have my fav Shrimp Scampi), but maybe opt for take-out. The bread was stale, service was nice but slow, and there were several little gnats circling our food...including one that landed in our drinks.

Mr. P.,"Falls Church, VA",0,17,9,3.0,6/14/2012,"Solid restaurant, nothing spectacular but I would probably go back if I were near CPK and craving Pizza.  The Food is very hit and miss. I ordered the Mac n Cheese bites and they were absolutely horrendous. Being someone who hates wasting food it was almost a chore to have to finish the Mac N Cheese bites. Would not recommend to anyone. They were overly greasy and sour. Not a good option. As far as the Pizza's they are decent but nothing spectacular. Essentially they taste just like a step up from frozen Pizza's. I do love though the variety of Pizza toppings. The California club Pizza is exactly like it sounds like, lettuce, avocado, ranch dressing etc. The Thai pizza with bean sprouts is also delicious. Again good tasting Pizza's but nothing spectacular. It definitely though is absolutely overpriced. You will be paying $15-$25/Pizza for what is essentially a personal Pizza served on a plate. I wouldn't advice splitting one Pizza because it will probably leave you hungry.  This place however does get extremely high marks on it's tiramisu. Call me crazy because I have eaten dozens of Tiramisu at high end Italian restaurants but to me the Tiramisu here rivals with any I have had, and shockingly maybe the best. I would come to CPK just for their Tiramisu. They also have delicious homemade lemonades.  All in All this is a solid lunch option. Ok Pizza's but overpriced, and one dessert that scores high from me. I will go here from time to time. Service seems adequate although I did watch as one lady couldn't find her credit card and was looking all over. Under tables, on the seats, and the server ensured her that he had given her back her credit card. After they had looked for maybe 10 minutes he finally went to check back at the register where he should have in the first place and lay and behold he never gave her card back to her.

Nat W.,"Ashburn, VA",6,77,23,3.0,5/11/2009,"I love food.  To be specific, I love pizza. Pizza has been one of my worst enemies through out my life.  The excess weight gain from chowing down 2 whole pizzas at a time that finally ended with countless hour on the treadmill to work it off.  One run on sentence too many already, let's start with the review of the California Pizza Kitchen at McLean, VA (Tyson I). I went out with my co-worker buddy.  She had her crew out and we decided on the California Pizza Kitchen.  This kind of place reminds me of PF Chang, or Cheese Cake Factory.  I would describe it as fusion food.  After 10 minutes or so worth of looking at the menu, I decided on the Pesto Chicken Pizza. It was so good.  I inhaled the entire pie within 15 minutes.  The doe wasn't exactly a doe.  It is a cross between cracker and bread.  It's crunchy and yet chewy at the same time.  Some called it thin crust, but I think it is different.  It reminds me of a crispy version of Nan. You might think that if I love it so much, why am I only give it a three?  Well, I was very hungry.  So anything would taste awesome at that point.  Heck, one of the guys was saying that we could have the Mickey D's two door down if we did not have to wait 20 minutes for a table.

Anna W.,"Centreville, VA",3,43,102,4.0,5/23/2011,"I come here all the time and I've never have an bad experience. For appetizer I really recommend the Spinach Artichoke Dip. There artichoke dip has got to be the best one I have tried from any other restaurant. You can tell that they dip is really fresh and now from frozen products. It comes with tortilla chips on the side, but I like to use the bread that also come on to the table. I do not recommend trying the Korean BBQ steak tacos. It is very americanized and the steak does not have much taste to it. I would say that if you really want a good experience trying a Korean BBQ steak taco to try it at an actual Korean restaurant. The Avocado Club Egg Roll is pretty BANGIN'! My first bite into it was soo amazing!! I really do recommend this to anyone that likes avocado. The creamy texture to the egg roll is a really nice touch. It does not taste any similar to the one from Cheesecake Factory. The ranch sauce is a nice touch to the egg roll since the egg roll contains bacon bits in it. I have not tried many of there sandwiches, but the one I tried was SOOO GOOOD! I tried the California Club Sandwich and it is really good. If you like a good BLT than you should try this! This is just like and BLT but with avocado and chicken. It is on a foccacia bread which is pretty good too. It has garlic cheese and red onion on top of the bread and the bread is not to hard. The Moroccan Chicken Salad is pretty good. I honestly thought that I would not enjoy it cause it has beets, butternut squash and dates in the salad. But honestly the beet is pretty sweet and soft and same with the squash, it goes well with the salad. The dressing is just an balsamic vinegrette, which is still a nice touch to the salad. The dressing does not make the salad, the avocado, beets, squash, date and the chicken make the salad!! The CPK Cobb is the BEST Cobb salad I ever tasted! You can get a half order or a full. But the FULL is pretty BIG for ONE person. The salad is soo fresh and well put together that no other Cobb salad will ever taste better than the one from CPK! If you are not a big fan of walnuts and Gorgonzola Cheese than I do not recommend the Waldorf Chicken Salad. I did not even enjoy it myself. The salad it self is good, but the cheese gets in the way of every bite, and the cheese was too over powering. It is mixed with fresh field greens with a Dijon balsamic vinegrette. If you, like fresh field greens with a vinegrette just ask for it without the Gorgonzola! The Cesar salad is nothing special. It is like any other Cesar salad. Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Hawaiian Pizza does not taste any different or special for the other ones that I have tried before. The Original BBQ Chicken Pizza is OK also, but not any different from the other ones I have tried from pizza chains. BBQ Chicken with Applewood Smoked Bacon Pizza is pretty good. The Gouda cheese does give the pizza a nice tang to it. The Meat Cravers Pizza and the Sicilian Pizza is REALLY meaty. So if you really like your meat than I recommend this pizza. My dad and sister really do love pizza and they both LOVE to eat meat! Tostada Pizza is a bit bland. I feel that it is not that great of a pizza. I think that they should have made a Tostada Salad and not a pizza. I was actually really disappointed when I tried this. The Chipotle Chicken Pizza is AMAZING! It has got to be the BEST pizza they have there!! If you like SPICY, than you should really try this. My boyfriend loves it and everyone else that tries it. I have recommended it to many people and no one ever disliked this pizza. Jambalaya pasta is not that good. Well I am not a big fan of Jambalaya. But my parents and sisters do seem to love it. I think that I have tried better from Sweet Waters. Chicken Tequila Fettuccine pasta is the BEST pasta they have. Well I think that it is. It is very creamy and spicy at the same time. The bell peppers in the pasta gives it a sweet taste to it too. I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS PASTA! Garlic Cream Fettuccine is actually not bad at all. The garlic does not over power the taste of the pasta. I got it with chicken and shrimp before. I recommend the shrimp with the pasta. I feel that a garlic cream goes well with shrimp. Pesto Cream Penne pasta is OK. The basil pesto cream is a bit over powering for my taste. If you like a basil cream than go for it~!

We drove home with them (about a 20 min. drive), and they were still good. A nice touch: they gave us all of the toppings for the tostada pizza on the side, so that when we got home, you put all of the toppings on yourself, so that they don't get all mushy).

They all looked amazing! I settled on the CPK Cobb Salad which has bacon, avocado, grilled chicken, diced tomatoes, basil, fresh beets and Gorgonzola cheese. Yummmm.  Now, the salads here aren't *healthy* but I just wasn't in the mood for pizza.  However, a woman sitting at a nearby table ordered a pizza with a salad on top and I want to try that next! Our waiter was super nice and attentive and I had a really great time here.  The avocado egg rolls aren't as good as the ones at Cheesecake Factory.  I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed my experience.  I have only been to one other CPK (in Boston) and I also remember it being fun.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mclean?start=120

I've been to and enjoyed other CPKs before, but I won't be going back to this one again. It took at least 15 minutes for anyone to greet us at the table, after we flagged down the host and finally asked if we were going to be served. After ordering, our appetizers came out at the same time as our entrees and one person's entree was not brought until the meal was already almost over. Beyond that, the food was not very good. Everything was over greasy or over creamy (pizzas and soups) and all 4 of us felt pretty sick after leaving.

Jeff W.,"Falls Church, VA",192,532,3,4.0,4/6/2009,"I was truly stunned by how much I enjoyed my meal at CPK.  I had only been to one once before, and I thought sure that the mall location wouldn't be as good as a standalone restaurant.  Needing some non-food court food before a movie (I wasn't gonna waste my button-down shirt on chinese food or Five Guys!) we avoided the overcrowded Gordon Biersche and the disgusting La Sandia and headed into CPK in the bowels of the mall. I was honestly expecting novelty pizzas that would be impractical and indulgent, a la Generous George's in Alexandria, but the menu actually read like a well thought out, well planned meal.  Still, all the creativity in the world could falter at the hands of sloppy execution so I was still skeptical. We started with the Tuscan Hummus which was kind of like a cross between hummus and bruschetta.  Surprisingly good, and surprisingly filling.  I wouldn't put it up against a greek restaurant, but it was satisfying.  My meal was the carne asada pizza.  It arrived quickly and was piping hot and had perfectly cooked steak, cilantro, and pico on it.  Tons of flavor!  It tasted light and balanced and I was blown away.  The dough was also very good, though I would have liked to try their honey wheat dough. Overall, at $12 for a personal pizza, it's a little more than a pizzeria, but unique enough that it's worthwhile to get every now and then.  Don't turn your nose up too quickly just because it's a chain.  In my experience, CPK did an excellent job, and I think might be my new goto pre-movie dining destination!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mclean?start=120

Mine was alright, very bland, but my boyfriend's pizza was amazing. The crust was like nothing i've ever tasted. It was soft for pizza, but it went so well with the flavors.

I was sitting, just sipping on a pepsi and chatting with a friend after ordering. Suddenly, a little boy runs past me, turns, and shouts to his mom, ""No, we can't go out this way, it says, 'use other door!'"". As I watch him turn around and run back, something small, extremely fast, and grey catches my eye. As my eyes catch up to it, I see an abdomen and tail squeeze it's way into the booth next to mine. I look at my friend and she looks back at me. ""Did you see something?"", she asked. I leaned in and said, ""Dude... Mouse. That was a fucking mouse. Mouse. Mouse. Mouse. Mouse."" She looked at me, wide eyed with horror as she confirms my sighting. We get up, find our waiter and tell him we are getting out of there. He asks why and I try not to look totally disgusted and say, ""you've got a mouse, which probably means mice."" He gets the manager and she apologizes and goes on to tell us that because Tysons is undergoing construction (such as the new Panera that was just put in across from them) there has been a mouse problem. Until that moment, they thought they were mouse free, but Slade's (above) had been experiencing problems as well as a few other places. They gave us a lot of free stuff, and we left with our meals in a to-go bag and they promised to call someone and get it taken care of immediately.

In fact we waved down the hostess to make sure he knew we were seated. He took our order all at once, drinks, an appetizer, and 3 entrees. At that point I checked in on my yelp app. We waited a good 10 minutes on drinks, but 2 came from the bar so I excused that wait. A full 30 minutes after ordering our appetizer still had not arrived.  I asked a waiter that was passing by to get the manager because all during this time our waiter had only been back to our table once and several tables who sat after us were already enjoying their meals. The manager seemed concerned and went to check on our food. She returned with our entrees and explain our appetizer was coming out late. She took care of our check and that is why I'm giving 3 stars.

I have never been treated so horribly at CPK in the past until I came to this location. We came in around 5 pm on a weekday (not rush hour) and it was quite empty inside the restaurant. While looking over the menu I see 2 or 3 waiters walk by thinking they were going to introduce themselves and ask what we would like to drink. Nope, completely ignored with each passing. I flag down the host to find my waitress and she eventually strolls over. No smile, no introduction, no apology for the lack of service. She immediately asks what we want to order and walks away. We were shocked by her lack of enthusiasm and service. We didn't even get water until we had to ask for it! The most disturbing thing was that our waitress was extremely nice and provided great service to the table of non-asians in front of my table. Maybe it was a racism issue? I know I can't make assumptions but you can't help to wonder about these things when you're in that type of situation.  Food was okay but the experience was definitely ruined by the poor service. I kept seeing the wait staff act extremely unprofessional. They were fooling around, smirking, and whispering at each other while staring at customers. I felt really uncomfortable and wondered if they were gossiping about the customers.  At the end of my meal, I requested to speak with the manager about my experience. He was extremely apologetic and assured me that he will address the poor service we experienced. I mentioned to him that there are many other yelp reviews making claims about the poor service and that this may be an ongoing problem that is now difficult to fix. He sort of shrugged it off and told me he doesn't believe in yelp. Hey, to each his own I guess. He did give me a $15 gift card to go back but I have been extremely hesitant.

The cheese had congealed and the left half of my pizza morphed into itself. For $10 for only 6 slices, that's ridiculous that one of the slices is essentially half missing. They also pre cut the top few pieces and removed them. The photo below is exactly what I saw as soon as I opened the box.
