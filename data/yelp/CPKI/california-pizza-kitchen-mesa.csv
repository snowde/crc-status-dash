Sudeep B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",136,114,139,4.0,1/24/2013,Cant go wrong with the tostada pizza and all the other unique pizzas. I always enjoy trying something new here.

Katie N.,"Gilbert, AZ",17,24,4,3.0,5/23/2013,"I love CPK, but not this location. The service, while usually friendly (but sometimes not), is always bad. The food has always been consistent, within this location and with other locations, until tonight. I got something I get almost every time, and it was terrible. (The manager offered to take it off our bill.) my husband was concerned about the chili pepper garnish that he, thankfully, knew not to eat. The waiter saw our empty glasses and never refilled them. The girl who brought our good only refilled them because we asked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mesa?start=60
Alexis S.,"Mesa, AZ",1,9,,4.0,8/21/2013,"This is a pretty solid restaurant for me. The service is decent and the food is good. My favorites are the mango mango mojito and the pesto cream penne pasta.

Andrew M.,"Mesa, AZ",77,28,8,2.0,6/13/2013,"Took my son to lunch at this location last week.  I tried the Thai peanut pizza.  It was pretty good but ended up eating more of my son's Chicken BBQ.  Both were okay, but lunch for 2 ended up costing me over $50 for 2 people... and we didn't even order dessert.  Too pricey for my taste!  Probably won't be going back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mesa?start=60
Mary M.,"Kekaha, HI",170,39,12,3.0,1/12/2012,"Had to come here because Oregano's was crazy as usual (1 1/2 hr wait...) and with a party of 12... that would have been a disaster.... but we went to CPK and still had to wait 1 1/2 hrs for our food.... hmmm, not sure we made the best choice.  And like others said... had to ask for the bread and butter even though we were clearly starving and not willing to order the $10 appetizers...  but gave in anyway... so when we asked the waiter how long our food would be cause we were thinking of ordering and appetizer he said our appetizer would be out before the food... but low and behold... food comes out 2 mins later.... hmmm... sounded a little tricky to me.  Food was good, but not as good as Oregano's and will remember that that 1 1/2 hr wait Oregano's is worth it.  But the company was wonderful and it made up for the temporary starvation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mesa?start=60

Alex K.,"Mesa, AZ",25,59,7,2.0,12/3/2007,"My daughter loves this place.  I on the other hand..would love to love it...but can't.  It doesn't help that this is a new location with a full staff still in training. The service was slow and inept, the food was mediocre even by California Pizza Kitchen standards.   One thing that I do have to admit is that I have never been a huge fan of ""novelty"" pizzas.  I view Thai chicken pizza, buffalo chicken pizza as just that...novelties.  I put it in the same category as a ""pizza"" burger.  If I want Thai chicken...I'll go to a Thai restaurant.  There used to be a pizza here that I liked.  It had pepperoni, fresh mozzarella and capers on it.  It's not there anymore. I wonder if there was no room on the menu for it and the Cajun pizza. Sigh. My daughter and I each had a focaccia sandwiches.  I had the caesar salad, she the vegetarian.  Mine was non-descript, hers was actually quite good.  It had portabello shrooms along with red and yellow bell peppers.  If I am ever forced to go there again, maybe I'll order it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mesa?start=60

Alisha A.,"Gilbert, AZ",2,15,,1.0,9/23/2015,"To be honest, I have been contemplating on whether or not to post this review. I've thought long and hard about it but I think it's important that this feedback be shared.  A couple of weeks ago a friend and I met here for dinner. I don't want to go into details but here's what you should know. There is a certain waiter here who needs some basic customer service training.  It's fun to occasionally joke with your waiter but there is a flow when you are at a restaurant and your server should be busy enough that they don't have a lot of time to socialize at your table. This was not the case. Though we tried to politely indicate that we weren't there to socialize with him, he wouldn't ""take the hint."" Things got weird, uncomfortable, and awkward. He slammed the dessert menu on our table!  He got angry and said some strange things. I'm no Psychology major but I took enough in college to know that he's bordering on sociopath.  When we complained to the manager, we never got an apology. We got some excuses, ""He's the best waiter we have, etc."" Umm...Really?!  To be fair, he did comp our meal which was nice.  Bottom line: the food was fine. But I will never patronize this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mesa?start=20
Rose K.,"Gilbert, AZ",4,3,,4.0,9/15/2016,"We are new to the area and never had California Pizza. The ambiance was fresh and clean. The waiter and kitchen manager Rafael were very nice. We were awestruck when the kitchen manager Rafael gave us a free complimentary appetizer. Wow. What a rarity these days. The appetizer and pizza were great. The pizza was unique. We had the California club pizza. What is amazing about California Pizza is the experimentation of what we call Pizza. If you are looking for a unique pizza dining experience this is one to have. Not your same old pizza.  Thanks to the wait staff, chefs, and Rafael for giving us a wonderful dining experience. Can't wait to try a different pizza. :-) Rose",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mesa?start=20

They only speak Spanish in the kitchen so they're all Mexicans and the public health department needs to visit them.  Are they really try to poison me? How can food be this bad that my friend and I are both sick the next morning after the dinner at California Pizza. Hiring drop outs from school will only ruin a Restarant !

Patrick W.,"Mesa, AZ",229,100,14,3.0,7/3/2016,The server was awesome and the place was clean. What I remembered from the old CPK was the Jamaican jerk pizza was awesome. This time it fell a little flat. The crust was burnt and reminded me of box pizza. Don't get me wrong it was still pretty good I just remembered it a bit differently. But the real reason for the 3 star bc nothing really deserved it was the shear fact that within a couple hours I swelled up like a wet diaper. I had to remove my shoes it was that bad. Outside of that the service and staff were great. Maybe next time if we come I'll order something a little different and probably healthier :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mesa?start=20

I had to wait quite a while for a refill and our server never seems the be around. We had a lot of other( must have been expediters) people come by and didn't notice my drink was all ice. I would have said something but the cane and went so fast I didn't get the chance. And it wasn't busy at all. 12 people that were wait staff standing around and only 6 tables of people.  Also, I realize pepperonis make pizza greasy, but my pizza was exceptionally greasy this time. It ended up drenching the back. Hopefully next time it will be a little better.

Kat G.,"Gilbert, AZ",32,83,132,3.0,11/6/2015,"This was our second time going to this location, only because the first time we had so many issues that one of the managers gave us a free small meal coupon and did everything in his power to get us to come back again, including giving us a few cookies on our way out. Honestly if it wasn't for him swinging by our table we would have never returned to this location again. But good thing we did come back, we went during a weekday and the place was pretty slow but yet our server was still on top of things, even though he was playing bartender as well, we started off with a mushroom flatbread which was pretty tasty. Then for our main course I got their chicken tequila fettuccine and my boyfriend got one of their pizzas. I thought my pasta was pretty delicious and the server told my boyfriend his pizza would change his life lol but my boyfriend thought it was pretty good but not life changing. I am sure we will be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mesa?start=20
Shana S.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,,1.0,8/30/2015,Worst service ever.  We went in to eat at 4pm on a Sunday and there were only a few tables and about 8 waitstaff so we should have had perfect service.  Instead the staff stood around gossiping and we never got drink refills and waited forever for our check.  On top of that we were very unimpressed with the food.  My boyfriend had a salad that was $18.50 and the corn in it looked old and his salmon way over cooked.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mesa?start=20

The pizza was as good as I remember.  And as small.  I love the spicy Sicilian, even if it is thin crust. The food came fast. And even though we had to ask for more bread, the service was good.  There were three of us, and we finished 1.5 pizzas (the Sicilian, and a mushroom, sausage and pepperoni).  The pizzas are just a bit small.  But the flavor is very good. One complaint would be that the bread service was cold.  I like my bread warm from the oven!  The bread was good, but warm would have been better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mesa?start=20
R. S.,"Mesa, AZ",0,8,,1.0,5/12/2016,"Met my wife for lunch here. We each ordered a bowl of soup and a half sandwich. With hardly anyone in the place we waited 25 minutes for our food. Actually I had to ask the waitress to bring the soup so we could begin eating. The soup, Pea Barley, was tasteless. It was hot and thick with no taste. Finally, the sandwiches arrived. My wife's, a crusty chicken, was cold inside. Apparently, the chicken is frozen and then sometimes cooked. There is nothing to say about mine, the turkey with brie, because there is nothing to say. This place takes no pride in their sandwiches, in fact, there are only four on the menu, variations of two chicken and two turkey. Our Ice Tea and Soda were $3 each. So, for this grand meal, the charge was $28 including tax. Apparently, if you go to a Pizza Kitchen, you'd better order pizza.

I also discovered their new Fresh Strawberry Mango cooler. I will choose a place to eat based on the drinks alone... For example, I'll opt out of places with Coke products for a place with Pepsi, even if the coke place has slightly better food. Anyway back to my review... The server was kind and quick enough.

They came out to say it would be another 10 minutes. Very polite about it so I can not say this service is bad. However the pizza was awful. Crust was so tough and chewy.

Bryan B.,"Crestview, FL",0,12,5,2.0,2/21/2016,"Yuck, on many levels. Had lunch about 2pm on a Sunday afternoon...place was not busy at all. Ordered cocktails and 10 minutes later they still had not shown up. After a quick comment to our in the weeds (with two tables) waiter,  drinks were delivered with long apology.  Finally when our out of the frozen pizza box pizza showed up, we had to ask for silverware. After what seemed like another 10 minutes, the GUEST at the next table got up and returned with OUR silverware and extra napkins for himself???   Waiter finally showed back up and had not remembered our request for silverware.   The signature bbq chicken pizza was aweful...dry, chewy chicken with no real bbq flavor...this place was bad on every level, we ate on the patio, and literally every table needed bussing for the full hour and a half it took us to wait and dine, instead of bussing tables they would shuffle folks off to the inside to eat on this beautiful weather afternoon....All was bad,  except for the Moscow Mule cocktail. Only reason I generously offered 2 stars.....but heck at almost $9 for one drink, one would hope it was good....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mesa?start=40

Marsella K.,"Gilbert, AZ",361,202,53,3.0,7/9/2011,"Apparently a lot has changed at CPK, I haven't been in a while. I came in for lunch today with my 3 year old son.  The first thing I looked at was the kid's menu.  Like a typical 3yr old, my son is very picky so I immediately looked for a chicken nuggets option.  They had one, but strangely it did not come with a typical order of fries, it came with broccoli.  Now, I totally understand that kids need to eat well and support their effort to give a veggie option, but there didn't even appear to be another option for a side.  My son eats pretty healthy at home, but Saturday after his t-ball game is when I take him out and let him get whatever he wants - and that should be my right as a parent.  So, knowing that if he saw broccoli on his plate he'd refuse to eat, I decided to order him a pizza instead.  He chose the honey chicken pizza since he's not a big fan of tomato sauce and told me he wanted chicken. When the pizza came out and he refused to eat any, I got kinda pissed since eating out with him is always a struggle and I'm getting fed up.  More on this later. For my lunch, I enjoyed the hummus appetizer... back up for a sec - I first ordered the small craving ""Mediterranean plate"" since I only wanted a little and it was described as hummus with Feta and pita bread. But then the waiter explained to me that it was really only a teaspoon of hummus.  WTH - who orders a teaspoon of hummus?... Anyway, the hummus was great as I remembered (but I swear it was a smaller portion than it used to be), as was the smashed pea soup.  My lunch was yum.  Service was fine, a B I'd say. When we got home later, I again encouraged my son to eat some pizza and he again refused.  I thought this was weird since he hadn't eaten since breakfast and he is generally a pig.  When I tasted the pizza I almost gagged - GROSS!  And let me tell you I LOVE pizza.  I was secretly not so mad about the leftover pizza 'cause I knew I could eat it later.  But folks this was yuck.  It's described a having a blend of white and yellow cheese, but I would bet cash money that this was some imitation Velveeta processed cheese food crap.  The pizza is now in the trash and I made my son a chicken & (real) cheese quesadilla :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mesa?start=40
Suzanne L.,"Maricopa, AZ",5,14,,2.0,12/13/2011,"It had been a while since I'd been to CPK as my husband hates it. Regardless I had (notice the past tense) always loved CPK, especially their hummus and pita bread. Last night it was pouring rain out here in Mesa, I had gotten back late from the dog groomer, so it was going to be a ""go out for dinner"" night or an ""order something from somewhere and pick it up"" night. My husband opted for Panda (not my fav) and since he was going to Dana Park, I picked CPK. When I looked at their online menu, I noted that some things had changed. Gone was the pasta with portabella mushrooms that I had always loved. I think it was some type of ravioli dish. The hummus offered also seemed different, but truly it's been a couple years since I've been in there, so I wasn't sure. I just looked at the menu and didn't realize the prices of things aren't on there. What is this trend? Since when does anyone look at a menu and not want to see the prices. It's bad enough when the fancy-schmancy restaurants (mostly in Scottsdale) do this, but this is CPK for crying out loud. I had been to my Italian lesson and I wanted some pasta...I should have just gotten some from my teacher...she's a great cook. Anyway, I ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese, the Fried Mac & Cheese Appetizer, and of course, the hummus. I knew I would just eat a little bit of each and have plenty for the day after and probably the next day too. When my husband got home he said, ""next time you order from them, you might want to think twice about it...the bill was over $26.00."" From CPK? For crying out loud, I could have gone to Olive Garden for probably less than that, and if not, at least I would have gotten unlimited breadsticks and their fabulous salad. But here's the rub...the hummus which came in an individual dish was maybe 1/16th of an inch thick. If I had bothered to take all six slices of pita bread and had spread the hummus over the tops of all of them, I think I would have had enough hummus for three slices. RIDICULOUS, people. My Spaghetti Bolognese was icy cold (which was helped by the microwave), but there was no sauce...there was only cold liquid. Granted it had stuff in it, but when you order sauce you expect sauce. I did get a kick out of whoever was taking the order when I pronounced Bolognese correctly (Bo-lan-yay-say) and he corrected me and pronounced it (bo-lo-nee-see), but that's just me being an Italian language snob now that I'm learning it. I didn't correct him.  The Fried Mac & Cheese was good but not knowing how much any of this cost, I am pretty sure it wasn't worth whatever my husband had to pay. All in all, I won't go back to my fav CPK for the delicious hummus. Plain truth is, I won't go back at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mesa?start=40
David P.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,184,,3.0,11/5/2017,"I see these locations all over. I drive by thinking: I went there a long time ago and it was good enough. I think it's been about 10 years. The time before that would have been about 10 years in between as well. Landed here the other night.  Decor looked the same. Menu: darned if I could tell if anything has ever changed. Clean. Friendly but distracted staff. World Series on TV. Thai chicken and BBQ chicken pizzas on hand-tossed crusts. Nice flavors. Reasonable quantities of proteins. Fair price.  For dessert, nearby staff all chimed in at once and said that we had to have the butter cake. OK. Before I realized what had happened the server had cleverly up-sold the order to include the ice cream. I probably would have said yes no matter what. But, I didn't realize on the spot that was an up-charge. So, here's the thing: if you read others of my reviews, I'm pretty consistent. I want dessert! I need to have it offered or I won't order it (because, ""do you want fries and a Coke with that should be automatic up-sell language for any server all the time). I am a card carrying choco-holic. I would have liked for a bit of a run down of the choices. The butter cake isn't all that. OK. It's not bad. The ice cream was frost bitten with ice crystals in it. And, more importantly, the scoop, which looked huge, was only a 1/2 scoop. Buzz kill! After the server asked our opinion, to which I said ""it was alright,"" she said she hadn't heard that harsh a criticism of it ever. I explained it needed chocolate. She then said, ""oh, you should have ordered the chocolate souffle."" Well, too late! It's not that I won't come back. I probably will. But, it may be another 10 years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mesa

Christine B.,"Mesa, AZ",30,135,120,2.0,3/27/2017,"My family used to enjoy California Pizza Kitchen a great deal. After our last visit, I'm afraid that has changed.  They seem to have changed their recipes for pizzas several times over the past few years, and not for the better. The crust, in particular, is just not very good. They also skimp on cheese and toppings.  I noticed that some reviews for this location state that customers received excellent service. This has not been the case for us at all the last few times. The servers we've had are not rude, just completely lacking in customer service. Your drinks sit empty on the table for long stretches of time, and it feels like you're always having to hunt your server down for anything and everything you need. Items you request are sometimes forgotten. I see this as poor  management and training.  Since the menu items here are on the expensive side and do not match the price point in taste and quality, I don't see us coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mesa

The food took more time than expected to get to us, but it was worth the wait.  The only complaints I have are 1) the service was slower than  prior visits and 2) our server was clearing the table and rather than going to the left of me to clear some dishes, he actually reached over from my right side to clear them ... right in front of my face as I was taking a bite of pizza!  It was awkward!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mesa

The first time they told me my order would be ready by a certain time, and I showed up and waited a solid twenty minutes in the restaurant before it was ready. Considering all I ordered was soup and bread, and it was a lunch shift, I was pretty annoyed- but the employee was nice enough so I thought I'd write it off as a bad day.  Today I placed my same order, soup and bread to go. I politely requested extra bacon and utensils/bread for two so my husband and I could share the soup. This time it was ready on time, but no extra bacon, bread, or utensils, and there were no napkins in the bag. I even tipped 2 dollars on an 8 dollar TAKE-OUT check. Disappointing.

The food, however, seemed lacking in flavor.  I had a wild mushroom pizza.  It could have used more zip.  And no pizza condiments were on the table to add more pep.  The roasted veggie salad looked good, but reality was some veggies mixed in with a lot of lettuce.  Having dressing on the side removed some of the flavor maybe, but the veggies could have been more interesting. Frankly, the pizza tasted like a frozen pizza.  ""Made fresh"" should have a lot more flavor.  Sadly, it didn't.  Perhaps trying other dishes would be better here.  Maybe they are being too diverse and need to focus on the fundamentals....they have tacos, for Pete's sake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mesa
