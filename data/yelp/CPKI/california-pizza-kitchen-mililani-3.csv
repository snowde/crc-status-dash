Kevin M.,"Waipahu, HI",1,11,1,1.0,10/28/2017,"15-20 minutes wait for inside and outside.  We have a party of three, it's not raining, it's not cold. They must be short staffed or something but it's like they hate money. 5 parties waiting while the entire section (pictured) is empty.  I'm not a restaurant manager but I'd figure you'd want to sit parties and get some money flowing instead of having it wait at your doorstep.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=40
Scot U.,"Mililani, HI",22,71,85,3.0,9/10/2017,"California Pizza Kitchen has arrived in Mililani !  For a while I was hoping that it would come closer to Mililani (instead of having to go to Pearlridge) and it finally did.  We waited until the novelty died down a bit and the wait was more manageable, and  decided to go early for one of the first seating the other day.   I have to say the waiter was really attentive and personable.  I think since we were early and it wasn't a full house yet, he could spend more time with the existing people already seated and that was nice. The decor is the typical CPK, and everything is new and clean. You can sit outside (what used to be the sidewalk area), or inside. But depending on the time of day, if you choose to sit outside, you could be in the sun.  So maybe check it out as you're going in as it could affect where you choose to sit. Food can pretty quickly and yup, tasted like how I expected. Consistent CPK fare and presentation. So this place is A-OK, classic CPK presentation and taste, and everything that you would expect.  So yay! Another place to eat in Mililani!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=40

Lauren Y.,"Honolulu, HI",59,17,1,2.0,9/19/2017,"I'm a frequent flyer at CPK, however after my first experience at CPK Mililani, I'm afraid it will be my last. The only thing that substantiates the one extra star from the minimum would be the bartender who was working that night, who was really pleasant and professional.  After expecting this visit to go like any other CPK visit I've ever had, I ordered the usual (pesto cream penne, add chicken - YUM) and although the restaurant was not packed full, I did expect a wait as there was a decent amount of people in there. As we sat at the bar, my two friends and I received and finished our first round of drinks before bread came out. After ordering and finishing another round, we grew a little concerned. We looked around, and saw everyone who had ordered after us, already enjoying their meals.  We then checked in the the bartender, who said our food would be out any minute. Guess there was a mix up in the kitchen. Eh, it happens. Another round of drinks go by... still nothing. We ask the bartender again if she knows anything about our food. She says she will send someone to check on it again. The woman returns and apologizes, and lets us know our food will be out any minute now... heard that already. About 5 minutes later, we get our food - AND IT'S NOT EVEN HOT. Mind you, it's not ice cold, but it's definitely been sitting out for quite some time. I wouldn't even say it was still warm. At this point, I'm thoroughly annoyed. Then as I'm eating, I notice that there are about a total of 6 small chunks of chicken in my pasta. 6 small bites of chicken for an upcharge of $3 and change? Not right. I've ordered this at Kahala, Ala Moana, Kailua and Pearlridge, and I've never had this little chicken.  I keep my mouth shut per my friends' requests, although I'm fuming on the inside wanting to send all our dishes back to get refired.  On top of that... after waiting over an hour and fifteen minutes for our food to come out... and having the staff be well aware of this and our frustration.... No word from the manager. No discount. No big apology for the bad experience. Just a ""sorry about that"" when the food actually comes out.  Kind of disappointing that you have to make a big scene these days in order to get some kind of gesture from the business to apologize for having you wait, then serving you old food. I was expecting a 10% off or a free dessert or at the very least, the manager coming out and apologizing for the confusion. But sadly, nothing. For that reason, 2 stars. Really the most disappointing CPK experience I've ever had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=40

Charmaine C.,"Waianae, HI",41,112,65,5.0,6/18/2017,"Sad to say this Kapolei is lacking. It's either a hit or miss & the last time we were there it was a major miss, enough for both of us to not go back! The service was always late, enough for our server to not pay attention to us so we had to get the manager! The food was lacking, the only thing that was good was the drink! Will not be returning to this location but the other locations are good!! UPDATED!!!! I was invited back to Kapolei California pizza kitchen for an Entree as well as a better service experience. Thank you Alfred for inviting us back after a previous disastrous visits!! That was going the extra mile and I really appreciated it! We loved our visit and will be make it a point to visit again!!

Nicole Y.,"Mililani, HI",416,233,702,5.0,3/30/2017,"After two CPK fails at the Kapolei location, I was a bit apprehensive about dining here. But, I decided to chance it and brought my dad here for lunch.  The restaurant itself isn't very big as most of the restaurant is comprised of their large patio. We were greeted by the host who said the wait was 20 minutes. Relived it was only 20 minutes, we decided to wait. While we waited, we checked out the inside of the restaurant and noticed all of the staff that were on duty. We observed the managers checking in on patrons and efficient staff promptly clearing tables. Needless to say, we were impressed.  Before we knew it, it was time to be seated and we were quickly greeted by our server. Since we had time to figure out what we want to eat, we immediately ordered our food. Despite the restaurant being busy, our food arrived rather quickly. While we enjoyed our meal, we were frequently asked how we were doing or if we needed anything. It was really nice to have such friendly and attentive servers.  My experience here today changed my opinion on CPK. I had vowed to not dine at CPK after the bad experiences I had at the Kapolei location. But, not all locations are the same. We had an awesome meal with excellent service here at the Mililani location. Despite just opening four days ago, things seem to be running pretty smoothly. The staff are well trained and efficient.  Mahalo to the staff at CPK Mililani, we'll be back for more great meals here!  Tip: check out the new menu items ..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=40
Tina L.,"Mililani, HI",96,73,96,2.0,11/19/2017,"We came in for lunch on a Sunday, didn't seem to be too busy. We waited only a few minutes to be seated. I ordered the meat sauce pasta for my son and asked for the fruit plate asap to start for him. If u have young kids u know they don't like to wait for the food so I wanted something quick for him to snack on while we waited for our mains. After waiting for a while his fruits came WITH his pasta, and his pasta was cold. I ordered the garlic cream fettuccini with shrimp and mushrooms, I've ordered this many times before and today it just tasted off. Overall not a good visit. We originally stayed away from the mililani restaurant because on our first visit the server delivered our HOT food OVER my 1 year old sons head. You may not think it's a big deal but if something had happened to fall on him you better believe it would've been a big deal. However since we live in mililani we decided to give them another chance but I think We'll stick to the pearlridge location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=40
Michael M.,"Honolulu, HI",123,38,88,3.0,4/2/2017,"4/1/2017 It's a Saturday night and yes, they're just in their first week of opening.   We checked in with the front table, was told it'll be an hour wait and they will send us a text message when it's ready.   Which is fine, but remind you that there is a few tables that's been open for awhile.  4 tables which could seat 4 people each is open right at this moment.   So we walk around for about 45 mins, and finally come back to see that those 4 tables are still unseated.  We wait a bit more longer and finally decided to check back in with the front table, was told that it would be another 20 mins wait.  What the.....?!?? Are you serious?   As we wait a bit longer, I take a peek inside and there is 3 booths that's open, the same 4 tables that is open. And 2, 6 person tables open. We heard some other people near us also complaining, how come they are taking so long to seat people?   So we finally got a seat. Which took about an hour an a half. As we waited, they brought us the usual bread with oil. We start handing out the plates and from the looks of it, most of it seemed dirty as they had some black and brown spots.   The waitress takes our order. Not gonna mention the whole order. Anyways, we got the appetizers and we got most of our drinks. Well just the waters.  About 20 mins later, were still wondering where is our other soft drinks. I guess the waitress forgot what we ordered and asked us what we ordered.  We get our order, which the food is great. After we're almost done eating.  The waitress asks us if we need to box our leftovers, which we said yes.  A few of our cups of drinks is all empty. I mention to the waitress we need more drinks. She nods her head and walks away going to pack our leftovers. After she packs all of it. She asks us if we need a desert menu. I said no, but could we get more refills please. She then reacts and was like ""oh I'm sorry I forgot. What did you order again?"" Overall, customer service wasn't up to par as the other CPK. Food on the other hand was excellent.  If customer service was better (hoping they will get better) I would of gave 5 stars but knocked off two stars cause of it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=40

It took about 10 minutes for the bread to be served- no water no sign of waitress no utensils/ settings. So we start eating the bread. Waitress (Lisa) shows up And takes our drink orders quickly. drinks showed up a few minutes later. POOF! She is gone for a bit ( but still servicing tables around us)  we place my daughters order and an app since I'm waiting for my BF to join us. About 5 mins later he arrives. Again.. waitress is servicing tables around us... no eye contact with either my BF or myself. We FLAG her down after 10-15 mins and he orders a drink. The Stella took about another 10 mins to arrive to the table. Our food comes out in a decent time- but no offer to refill our waters, or ask my girls for a refill. She finally clears my girls plates- and we order another Stella.  2nd Stella came out in about 10 mins. She said doesn't ask my girls if they wanted dessert. 30 Mins pass and we flag her for my girls dessert order. At this moment- I'm not even mentioning it's my daughters birthday.  Lisa hears us talking about it and not once did she acknowledge. I'm not here for freebies.. but it's a child's 9th bday- you already missed the boat on the candles and song.. a bday wish would've been nice.

Shania D.,"Mililani, HI",17,14,1,3.0,12/26/2017,"Visited a couple of days ago during their opening time; wait wasn't bad at all, but at the end of the meal, I feel as if the food did not live up to my expectations. The waitress we had was polite, and had gotten refills on our drinks in a really fast manner which was great and answered whatever questions we had. I ordered the Wild Mushroom Strozapretti and hey it sounds pretty fancy, I love mushrooms and pasta so I mean this has to be the perfect dish. The food came out and I was really excited. I liked it the only things about it were the fact that the pasta was undercooked in a chewy tough way, and this may be me being picky but inside the pasta there is fresh thyme and looking at it it's basically stick figures in there that just have a tough texture that you're trying to swallow. Overall, experience was nice the staff was polite and welcoming just the food may need a little improvement here and there, especially making sure the food is cooked properly.

Salads at CPK were my favorite but I feel that they have changed the recipes. The salads don't taste the same, not to mention that the knife skills on the salad are very sloppy. In our BBQ chopped salad we had huge pieces of jicama that were the size of quarters.  I recently went to get takeout from the Mililani location and there was a new menu item. It was a white fish dish. This was over $25 and it was insanely small. I expect far more for something of this price and the quality was not great.

My  soup bowl was big enough to fit my face in it....no I didn't try it....but I put my hand next to it for scale btw I have big hands. The pizza toppings were fresh and delicious, I could really taste every flavor along with sauce. The dough was tasty and not greasy.

Tonite we went just for a quick Wedding Anniversary in the middle of the week. Wait time was 40 minutes. We got seated and was wished a Happy Anniversary by the hostess. Our server (Ashlie/Ashley) was pleasant and friendly took our order. Asked us if we'd like some bread? We said ""yes"". She also informed us that kitchen is behind on orders so a little extra wait time on food. She came back with our drinks and my Dr Pepper was flat, no fizz, no taste, more like water. I asked her if I could get a Coke instead and explained why. She changed out my order (I felt like I bothered her by asking to switch soft drinks).  She came back after to check on us, but still no bread. We figured oh maybe because kitchen is behind...bread must be baking or something. I would think that maybe she would come and give us a heads up/reminder about the bread??? Different lady brought our food and I decided to ask her about the bread. She said she will check, but also because kitchen was behind. I noticed her talking to Ashlie by the door. After a couple minutes Ashlie came to tell us the bread just finished baking and she will bring it out as soon as it is cut. She brought our bread and we were good. When the bill came my wife noticed our son got charged $2.69 Kids Sundae when the kids menu clearly stated that a Kids's Sundae was $.99 w/ Kids Meal purchase (which we did) We pointed it out to her, she apologized and said that was her mistake and she would correct it...which she did. She was really trying and the restaurant was busy. I think Ashlie just had a lot of tables to wait on and seemed overwhelmed.

Kevin L.,"Mililani, HI",41,67,33,1.0,3/30/2017,"Very upset experience... and we never set foot inside the restaurant.  Me and a group of friends decided to try out the new CPK in Mililani, we thought it would be crowded because it's a new attraction but when we came it was semi-empty.  We went during the pre-dinner rush, around 3. We were told to write our name down and left our phone number: they told us it would be a five to ten minute wait.  Well after two hours we knew we would not get in and that they probably forgot about us.  This left us very upset and we ended up going to genki ramen across from them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=60

And the tables are so close together here so I can hear conversations from the table behind me. I felt like our server was favoring the other table behind us for some reason (the way she interacts and communicates with them vs when she came by our table)  Anyway, I thought I'd give this location a shot but honestly the pearlridge location is better.

Sharelle O.,"Honolulu, HI",2,41,68,1.0,6/9/2017,"Had the most worst experience I've ever had at a CPK restaurant first things first is that we called for a reservation arriving at 11:30am we got there at 11:20 and I went up to the host to let them know we were already here she said okay ma'am we shall seat your party shortly , mean while we already had another appointment  at 3:00 figure that was enough time ! After 25 minutes went by which was already 11:45 I went back up and asked if we would be seated shortly the host replied ""  yes ma'am we just need to clean up your table "" okay sure now time is ticking and we don't get seated till about 12:05 I was upset ! For some reason I already knew it wasn't going to be a great experience after being sat we asked if our server could come to our table which she came about 10 minutes later she asked for our refreshments and said she would be back to take our order , it took her about 15 minutes to come back with 7 drinks ! Fine maybe that's a lot to do ! Then we placed our order and our food took 1 hr to come out ! We all pretty must lost our appetite ! In the mean time she only checked up on us 2x we had to ask for refills I mean come on she should've already had them coming out knowing we sat there for 1 hour ! By the time out food came some things were cold for example when order the spinach and artichoke dip and it came out still frozen the inside which I was so mad about knowing it took so long ! Some food was burnt some had no flavor the pasta we ordered was dry it was horrible !

Jennifer M.,"Mililani Town, HI",176,32,,3.0,4/1/2017,"Three stars. But, they're still in their first week so I'll have to give them another try. I made an online order tonight and had been quoted a 20 minute wait time.  I had never used their online order form before, so I was surprised at how easy it was.  I arrived at 10 pm on Saturday night and had no problem snagging a parking spot right in the front of the restaurant.  The hostess at the front was extremely helpful.  I appreciate that she walked me to where the take out cashiers were located instead of pointing and saying ""take out orders can be picked up there"" then sending me on my way.  As we walked through the restaurant, every employee smiled and/or greeted me.  The two cashiers at the take out counter were also polite and helpful.  My only two issues were: 1.  I was quoted a 20 minutes wait time for my take out order.  However, I actually ended up waiting when I arrived and didn't get my order until 40 minutes after it was placed online.  I was on my way to work so this was more of an issue tonight than it normally would have been for me. 2.  I didn't receive any bread with my order.  I know I specifically requested it when I placed the order, so I'm not sure why it wasn't in my bag. Other than that, the food was great and the customer service was on point.  I can overlook the issues I encountered on this visit and say I'll definitely give them another chance.  They've been open for barely a week, so I'll cut them some slack :) * Side Note: There is a separate entrance for take out orders that is located on the side, closest to Times, facing the parking lot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=60

Upon arrival we were greeted and sat immediately fronting the kitchen.  Our server, Emi, was amazing!!  She was super sweet and stayed on top of everything.  Our water was always refilled before it could reach empty and she constantly checked up on us to make sure everything was okay or if we needed anything else.

I loved the Service at Ala Moana and the pizza at Ala Moana was 100 % better.. Mililani needs much more improvements  I blame Mgrs. for not overseeing the employees... The poor server was so Confused and apologetic...i felt sorry for her..mgmt. also said she was going to take a pizza off our total but still charged as the server wasn't told by mgmt.

Yes there is a wait, which I already assume when I come here. I went here for dinner. I requested to sit inside (because I have come here in the past and we sat outside). The service was AMAZING! So we ordered  our appetizer, one pizza, and a pasta. About 15 minutes after ordering, one of the managers (female) came out to our table to tell us they ran out of the sauce for that specific pasta. She offered to make us another type of pasta and she gave a recommendation of the pesto pasta with a certain type of noodle and etc. We ask how much that would cost and she said she will take care of it .... long story short... she delivered the pesto pasta to our table, she apologized for the wait, and DIDN'T CHARGE us for the pasta in the end! When we asked another manager (male) how we would reheat the California club pizza we ordered, he gave us great suggestion on how people order the topping on the side and etc. He was very kind and service here overall was amazing!

Each time the food was good and the staff friendly.  The staff always seem to be concerned that we were happy and apologized for things that weren't a big deal. For example, today the waitress said sorry that your pizza came a few minutes before your salad did.  What impressesed me about our waitress was that she gave my 3 year old daughter a small piece of pizza dough to play with. She was so happy!  And it kept her occupied for a long time. I wonder if this is a new thing or just her brilliant idea. I hope I can get pizza dough again the next time I go.   The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because their pizza dough rewards app is still not working.

That's it. I don't know how many comp'd meals we've received or a discount on the food, because it's been that many times.  The management staff, except for the restaurant manager (I can't remember his name), don't seem very customer service oriented. One even told me that maybe we shouldn't use their online ordering system. Really?  Another questioned my order, that was clearly printed on the food receipt. We've started to physically go through each and every dish we get before we leave, and surprise surprise...it is almost always wrong.  Tonight there was no mozzarella on one salad, the other salad did not have the beets or the dressing.   Again, we love CPK, and it's one of the few restaurants in Mililani that serves fairly healthy food.  I hope the Management does something about their quality control and customer service, as they are severely lacking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=80

We were the fith in line. Took about 8 minutes then it was our turn. The person didn't say hi or acknowledged us. So I said table for two. He looked at the computer after a couple of minutes he ask us to step in. There was 3 workers standing after another minute one of them looked at us and ask us if we're the party of six. Said no then he looked at the computer and asked if we were the party of two. Said yes. And he picked up the utensils and menus. He than started looking around after another minute or two. A girl came. He gave her the utensils and menus. She then asked me if I wanted to sit in the restaurant or in the lanai. We said inside. She asked us if raised table would be okay. Said yes cause it was getting hot outside. The inside of the restaurant is set up like bar. The seating is high bar stools and a high padded bench. ( I wouldn't recommend this seating option if have trouble stepping up). Our server was cordial and took our order of spinach dip and side order of flat bread and a small salad. Our drinks came out and a couple of minutes later the spinach dip was served. Another five minutes later our salad came. Started to eat our salad and dip. After a few minutes we started to look for our server. The pita bread was to be eaten with the dip. Our server finally came our salad and dip was almost done. I asked her to cancel my order of pita bread. She was very apologetic and said she would go and get it. Told her we were done and to pack our dip to go. A few minutes later a manager came with a new spinach dip with our pita bread. Told him that we asked our server to pack our dip and left over chips to go. He apologized and left.

After sitting down, she looked at me, shook her head, then asked me what I wanted. No ""hello"" just ""what can i get for you?""  My drink was horrible, but food was great(as usual). I also noticed how she treated the waitresses. She was very cruel. I could tell the servers were busy, so when their drinks were ready, she got fustrated and yelled at the waitress for not picking up the drinks. Even if she was upset, the bartender should not display that agression to others in front of her customers. I felt like leaving immediately.

He took a big pad of paper out. Set it down in top of our table and began to recite and write down everything we ordered. A little awkward for him have his note pad on our table. We ordered fried Mac and cheese. They brought out a regular bowl of Mac and cheese to us twice before we got the fried Mac that we ordered. It was dry and not very good at all. My club style pizza (which I've had a few times at other locations) was dry and kind of burnt. But we still ate it. Spike didn't check to see how the apps were so we just said whatever and ate it. He seemed to be worried about the large party next to us a little more. I asked a glass of the Meiomi pino noir. He says ""which one is that?"". Hmmm shouldn't you at least know your wines by the glass? After I ordered it he kept walking by and saying out loud ""glass of wine"" as if he was reciting out loud as a reminder to himself to bring over my wine or ring it in? Again, It was so awkward.  I asked for share plates. He grabbed a solo plate from the server stand behind me and said ""I gotta go look for another one"". As far as I know the plate sitting on the server stand behind me could've been from anything. It was a little dirty when he set it down. But he walked away so fast trying ""to find another"" that I didn't have a chance to tell him.  Lastly, I asked for a box. He brought one over and proceeded to box up my food at the table. I stopped him and said I would do it. You either box it in the back or let the customer box it themselves. We don't want to see your hands all over our food right in front of us. It was so weird. He was a very intense server and my time was not relaxing what so ever mostly because we had to deal with him. You could tell he was trying to get everything done right but he was so unprofessional. He needs to trained. Two stars based solely on the service. Food is usually great at CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=120
Kim N.,"Mililani, HI",0,56,27,2.0,5/18/2017,"We went on a Tuesday night at 7pm and not that busy so why it took 50 mins to get seated was ridiculous. Especially since we were quoted 10-20 mins, then got the text saying approximately 30 mins. I HIGHLY suggest going back after your quoted time and asking where u are on the list if u haven't been called. Thinking that they had their stuff together, I went to check how much longer it would be being that 45 mins had passed and still nothing. Clearly when I asked how much longer, both hostesses that checked had that look of ""oh $H@!"" On their face and I was seated next. As we were being seated they tried to give me the ""we tried to notify you"". No. Just no. It doesn't make sense that I was able to get their initial text giving me my estimated wait time and nothing after that. I wish she had just saved it. So I started dinner irritated and with a hungry toddler. Yay. We order and the server was nice and we got drinks right away but we didn't even get bread til well over 20 mins after being seated. We actually got bread AFTER our food arrived. I didn't get a refill on my passion mango iced tea until right before we left but my one glass was really good! The food was pretty good. My chicken tequila fettuccine was at least.  I know this place isn't geared towards kids and you can tell. Note for parents considering: the only carb option they have on the kid menu is pasta. No rice. No mashed potatoes. Their grilled chicken was pretty dry as well. If your kid loves pasta then it could be a win for u though I tried my kid's alfredo and it was pretty blah. Our server did help box our leftovers which was nice.  I was super disappointed in the experience. Probably because of the reception but it just kept rolling downhill. I didn't even tip 15% and normally ALWAYS do regardless of how crappy service was cuz I know it supplements their low wages but I was just so irked with the overall service. It could be worth going for a quick lunch with no kids. I will not go there for dinner again. Ever. Period.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=120

We received a text within the 30 minute wait, and we sat down.  We were greeted by Zevan and he got our drink orders.  During this time (around 7:30 PM), the restaurant was very busy.  Zevan ended up being our waiter as well.  What I really appreciated about Zevan was that he came to check up on us throughout the night and our orders were perfect.  Watching him you can see that he had a lot of tables, and he was really bustin' his butt to make sure that everyone was taken care of.  Taking into account how busy the restaurant was, I feel that Zevan really took good care of us.  Of course his team also helped him out by delivering some of our food.  This is my third time dining at this location and this was my best experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=120
Briana Y.,"Colorado Springs, CO",5,142,67,3.0,5/20/2017,"I love California Pizza Kitchen's diverse menu. I've been to this particular location twice. The first time was on a very busy Friday night where we waited over an hour for a table. The second time was for lunch on a Saturday. On the busy Friday night, we watched an entire section of the outdoor patio area clear out and get re-sat at a glacial pace. I've worked in the restaurant industry before and I understand that you should wait until a server has served drinks to a table before seating another table in their section, but we saw a table finish appetizers before the next table was sat in the server's section. It took so long to seat the section I literally thought the server was cut for the night at one point. We were told the wait ahead of time, but upon viewing the seating practices, I think it was a false wait. When we went on another day for lunch, we ordered an appetizer and entrees. Our entrees came out before our appetizer, but the manager did deliver the appetizer and apologize. I had heard bad things about the service before visiting this location, but I assumed it was because they had just opened and they were still working the kinks out.

Not sure if it seats more than Kapolei. Pretty sure it's smaller than Kahala since Kahala has the ""outside of restaurant"" seating. The outdoor seating is awesome on a cool evening or even a warm one with a small breeze. Food is typical CPK good stuff. Newer menu items and ""specials"" or ""seasonal"" dishes always deserve a go.

Really? I'm doing a take out.  The cashier is doing nothing else special than to bring your order to you.  I don't mind tipping like I said but when they demand it then that is just not right.

They all seem to be trained really well, in that they were constantly checking in on or helping customers (regardless if it was their table or not) and the system overall ran smoothly. We didn't have any wait to be seated (but we did get there before 5 pm), everyone seemed to know what they were doing, and service was quick and very responsive.

And the menu is a tad different at this location than it is the others... either that or they got rid of the Asparagus & Spinach pasta. I arrive at CPK and went through the take out door.. there were 2 others waiting on their take out.  They seemed to have been waiting a while because they were offered a seat at the bar and bread to snack on and a drink while they waited... I went to the register and the gal asked for my name and got my order together.  She wasn't mean, but she rarely smiled either... kinda just went with the flow. She asked another girl to pack my food and mid way she got distracted with another conversation.  I just watched as my food was slowly being packed.  Manager approached me and asked if I been helped and I politely said ""yes, they're packing my food now"" and then there was some hustle.  Got my food, checked my order and went on my way.

Jeff G.,"Mililani, HI",17,2,,2.0,4/26/2017,"Went to this location per my wife's suggestion with my family of 4 on a Tuesday at 630. Was told there would be a 30 minute wait despite no other customers waiting and there being multiple 4 and 6 person tables open. Against my better judgment, I decided to wait the 30 minutes and get a text.  30 minutes go by and I still haven't got a text about a table opening up, so we go to ask the hostess what's going on. She seems suprised by our presence and says we will be the next available table... how convenient...  I look around and notice there are still plenty of tables open and not many customers waiting. On top of that, there seems to be a lack of wait staff for current customers. I trusted my gut this time, as I knew it would take forever to get waited on and have our food delivered, so I opted to cut our losses and go somewhere else.  I get that it's a Tuesday and they don't want a full wait staff, but would it really kill them to have an extra member or two working week nights so that the open tables can be sat? It seems silly to lose a family of 4+ because CPK has poor business planning and can't staff their restaurant to support the demand within the first month of opening!  A similar experience happened to me 10 years ago at a CPK in Boulder, CO, where we waited forever to be seated and it took over an hour to get our expensive, barely topped pizza. I vowed from that day to never eat at a CPK again, but here I am to show the wife what a joke this chain is. Their service is mind boggling slow. I have no clue why people enjoy this chain.  While on my soap box, the menu outside is completely devoid of pricing. Does CPK think it is a Michelin restaurant? Is their food so expensive that if I have to ask the prices, then I can't afford it? Really pointless to have a menu without prices. Good way at luring people in and sticking them with expensive food when they realize they waited forever and don't want to lose all that time waiting (sunken cost fallacy).  I will continue to avoid this chain as overpriced food with terrible service is not my cup of tea. Only giving 2 stars as we weren't able to eat the food to give it a fair assessment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=100

Ashlee O.,"Mililani, HI",240,18,29,4.0,7/25/2017,"So we did take out this time, 07/23/17 called in the order, and I must say the woman who answered the phone was super polite and asked about extra sauces with out me having to ask!  I was pleased at her demeanor and attitude towards taking my phone order.  I parked in the convenient to go stalls out side their establishment, my order was ready. The manager Tracie did come out to authorize the comps, which I really did appreciate. We went home....I really hoped it was perfect....and it was. Chives on the pasta, extra sauces for salads, all add ins accounted for. Even the butter cake and vanilla ice cream.  I really enjoyed this meal, and will be back but will probably stick to take out for a while. Had a really easy time getting food, food was correct and tasty!  Thank you again to Tracie and her team for the take out side that night!  JUNE 2017 This is my second time at this location and probably the worst of my entire life. I love the Pearlridge and alamoana location, so I was super excited to have a location closer to home.  Unfortunately both times eating in, AND the one time we ordered take out was so underwhelming.  For THIS EXPERIENCE in particular, we knew we would probably have to wait, even though there were like 1/2 the tables open. (Must be they can't find employees to work there)  We did get greeted within 30 seconds upon walking up to the podium, and told the wait time. So we waited only about 10 minutes which was surprising! So far so good right? So we got seated, our server took about 5-7 minutes to even come over to us. ALIKA? ALEKA? Something along those lines. That was HER name.  At first impression seemed like everything would be great, took our drink order, and left. The first drinks came in a pretty timely manner, then we ordered an appetizer, the avocado chicken spring roll or something. And LET ME TELL YOU HOW FLIPPING FAST THAT SHIT CAME OUT I kid you not, it came in about 3-5 minutes....which would be great, if they actually made it for us! It was COLD!!!!!! We did eat it any way and didn't complain at the restaurant because we were all starving already haha.  So we were like ""whatever"", and ate it. So we order,  Then I have no idea what her problem was, but ALIKA ALEKA what have you her name be idk, but she literally walked past our table for 15-20 minutes without checking once, for drink refills or ANYTHING. So now I'm upset because I am in the customer service industry, and have very high standards for establishments I frequent. Food was OK, but honestly ALIKA ALEKA (an African American women with glasses) was the worst waitress I've encountered in a very long time. So airheady slow moving and seemed just lost. She was folding napkins for us instead of refilling waters, running back and forth doing who knows what when other tables were looking around for her because she was NO WHERE TO BE FOUND.  I did manage to flag her down once for a drink refill before dinner got there. But by that time this chick just rubbed is all the wrong way. Either she needs better training, personal motivation to succeed at her career/job whatever CPK is for her. Because I've never had such bad service at any CPK. It's sad. Idk if she had too many tables to watch, or what. I'm just stating our experience and how it left us feeling that night, spending our hard earned money AND tipping some one who honestly didn't deserve even a 5% tip. I had so ask another waitress for water, because ALIKA ALEKA was again no where to be found. So now as another waitress comes to fill my water, ALIKA, decides to make an appearance to finally deliver my bf's beer, and as I'm telling the OTHER waitress thank you for my water, ALIKA goes in and says YOURE WELCOME with a smile like she is doing such an awesome job....like no.  I was saying thank you to the girl that was REFILLING MY WATER. So I did make it a point to thank her after my meal when we were leaving, since ALIKA took that thank you from her. All in all, I will probably eat here again, but if we get alika I'm walking out.

The server was excellent! She was very attentive and always coming back to check on our table.  The food was great as usual.

Yoonie L.,"Honolulu, HI",152,18,138,4.0,5/24/2017,"A group of my friends and I decided to eat at CPK at  the Mililani location before catching a movie for convenience since it's next to the movie theatre. I personally wanted to check it out too since it just opened there. We were greeted by friendly staff. It was a Tues night and we had no reservations and were seated immediately. Loved the Hawaiian decor inside with painted surfboards and LOVED the canvases of pictures on the walls. The place was quite large and had a great  outside terrace. Our waitress, Cami was really friendly and sweet. I had the Wild Mushroom Pizza and it was super tasty. The crust was nice and chewy with the right amount of crispy. Everything was fine until 2 of my friends decided to order the Salted Caramel Pudding to go since we needed to leave to catch the movie. When they each got their individual brown paper bags, when they pulled it out, one was full and the other was half the size. I called Cami over and she was very apologetic and ordered my short changed friend a new one and sent the Manager over to our table. He was very nice and also very apologetic and gave all 5 of us a free dessert voucher for the next visit! Hey, stuff happens but if they make it right, that's what counts! Will be back soon to try the Hawaii specific items and my dessert!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=140
Tiffany R.,"Honolulu, HI",75,7,10,1.0,9/11/2017,"I would give this place zero stars if it allowed me to. Despite all the bad reviews I've read and heard from friends and family, I decided I wanted to be fair and give them the benefit of the doubt! Well, let's just say it was a horrible experience!!! We got seated right away, BUT we sat and for 20-25 minutes, no one came to greet us or take our drink order!!!! This is when I decided that I wasn't waiting any longer! As we waited though, I noticed another table was still waiting to be greeted as well....and another table complaining that her kids didn't receive their desserts yet! Wth?! I told my hubby and son that we're leaving, but before we do...I'm making a complaint! Found the manager and asked if they were short staffed because no one came to our table after waiting for so long!!! She asked where we were sitting...told her where but at this point I'm so irritated that I told her we are leaving and that they should read their Yelp reviews because I'm not the only one who thinks their service sucks!!! Never again! How long have they been open? Luckily there's many other restaurants around here!!! Thank you CPK Mililani for ruining our Anniversary! I'm glad this wasn't our actual anniversary dinner!

Travis S.,"Kapolei, HI",13,2,,3.0,8/4/2017,"I can't believe I'm actually writing this, I've been in the industry for a long time and I know how servers think, but as a bartender you have to set an example for the service that the establishment has. So I recognize bad, good, and great service when I see it.  Yesterday afternoon I came in and with my two nieces to have a nice lunch, we were greeted by our hostess who was very welcoming and right off the back offered if we wanted to dine in or outside, we chose to sit inside. We get to our table and the hostess explained to me about the DOUGH membership, she was a little inaccurate about what she said but she hit the main points lol. A few minutes later our waitress Cheyenne(I had to ask her her name she didn't give us a spiel) she started us off with drinks and didn't explain the menu or the kids menu. But being industry I knew what I was doing. For some reason I could tell she was judging me by my appearance or maybe my age , some ignorant service workers do that, but I believe in serving people as if I were serving myself. She then comes back and mumbles something about appetizers and before I could even order an appetizer she walks away. Comes back a few minutes later and asks if we're ready, so by this time I just need to get my nieces fed. I ordered a cheese pizza and a Thai salad (so yummy) I'm never disappointed with the food when I dine at cpk and for the most part I get amazing service. But to feel judged in a place I come to all the time and being in the industry isn't acceptable to me. I am a very generous tipper but I definitely consider the service that I get. Back to my experience, food comes out I order a glass of wine took about 15 minutes to get there by then my craft is warm, doesn't check on us the whole entire meal , nor does she refill my water or nieces fruit punches, but in watching her service all her other tables and treating hen like royalty lol. I also ordered a ""potato wedge"" for my girls to share but they were just roasted potatoes so I'm guessing she didn't know the difference, I wanted to immediately send them back because they had no flavor so we weren't gonna eat it; normally I don't send things back I'll just pay it because I know that's annoying on the servers end, but at this point I could care less. So finally when we're ready to box up she comes and asks for a box(rushing us) and told her we didn't like the wedges, she smiled and took them to her manager 10 ft away from us and snobbishly said ""they didn't like them"". Our bill was $42 had my service been on point I would love left a generous amount but she got 20% and that's me being nice!  Moral of this experience, don't judge your customers! We all come out to eat for a reason to eat good food, and have good service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=140
Noways T.,"Mililani, HI",1,4,,1.0,7/9/2017,"Went to the Mililani one maybe 10 times so far, and service is getting crapper by the week. I don't think the care. If you really need Cpk, go somewhere else.  Last night we waited about 20 minutes to get in and the place was half empty. Seems like we arrived before the evening staff or they were understaffed. The person who seated us didn't smile, say hi, or anything but give us a sitting bitch face. She just walked us to a table. The next person who came by introduced herself, told us she wasn't our server, took our drink orders (beer and soft drink), then walked away. She returned with a drink for my young son and no straw. I didn't realize it so had to flag someone else down for a straw. 15 minutes later a girl stopped and asked if we had any questions. Who was this person? I guess she was our real server buy she never introduced herself or anything. 10 minutes later she stopped by again and I asked ""where's my beer?"" I finally got it after being there for 25 minutes. The place was still pretty empty.  We put in our food order and it came in reasonable time. I noticed that our particular server seemed really stressed. She had a few high maintenance tables. You know the type of people who think they're the most important people in the place and they own the wait staff? Yea, those types of idiots. Anyway, here's the worst part. There was a manager on duty, who just waltzed around with no concern or worried look on her face that some of her staff was dying. She actually walked past us about 10 times and I made eye contact with her on many occasions. I was going to ask for straw, napkins, another drink, etc. because the rest of the staff was sure to walk by as quickly as possible and avoid eye contact. Nah, this manager doesn't appear to care.  Save yourself from having to wait long for a forgettable experience. The other Cpk's are far superior to Mililani. This place can't use ""we're new"" as an excuse at this point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=140
Halia H.,"Wahiawā, HI",63,8,,1.0,9/24/2017,"I've gone to this place countless times, but the time I went last time was by far one of the worst dining experiences I've had.  The night seemed to go off well, other than the fact we had to wait 50 minutes for our seats at 8 pm at night. When we got seated, we got greeted by our nice waitress. She was sweet and gave us our drinks after we ordered our food right away after waiting the 50 minutes. It ended up taking about 30 minutes just for the food to come out. Not only that, but our bread and spinach artichoke dip appetizer took forever because they had to make more bread. So, after waiting 30 minutes for my mother, my friend, and I's three orders of Shrimp Scampi, Chicken Tequila Pasta, and Mac and Cheese pasta withe extra sauce, we were not satisfied at all. We were already irritated at the fact we had to wait 30 minutes just for our food and constantly getting apologies from our waitress about first the 20 minute wait for our appetizer, and then another 30 minute wait for our food. It was also my mom's birthday dinner, so we weren't so pleased. On top of that, the food was not delish at all... my mom ordered a shrimp scampi (which we get is supposed to be super healthy with all the zucchini and such), but my mom said it was way too sour. She made my friend and I try it ourselves... and both my friend and I did not taste the ""butter"" or ""shrimp"" at all. All we tasted was lemon. It was not enjoyable for my mom. Now, on to my mac and cheese.... I usually order this, and I honestly love it. But, this time, it tasted different. I had ordered extra sauce, and usually the extra sauce comes in a bowl on the side, but this time it did not. It was strange at first. And, even after a minute I got my mac and cheese, another waiter came to deliver the extra sauce in the tiny bowl, only to see that my plate was already drowned in the cheese sauce. The cheese sauce didn't taste like cheese at all. It tasted like milk. It didn't taste like the mac and cheese I always order from CPK. Maybe there was a different cook or something, but the service my mom, my friend, and I got last night was not impressive.  Aside from that, as I mentioned before, it was my mom's birthday... a nice employee who was off shift and sitting on the table behind us ended up buying us a brownie with ice cream. We didn't know he bought it for us, but we at least expected a free ice cream that they usually serve on birthdays (I've even had my birthdays at CPK before)... but we didn't... I had to remind the waitress once more it was my mom's birthday, in which she said ""They didn't give you the brownie and ice cream that the employee behind you bought for you guys?"". We had no clue the nice waiter who was off duty had bought it for us. We could have walked out without it or without any ice cream dessert for my mother's birthday at all.  Thankfully, the manager ended up coming to our table to ask what was wrong, in which we told him... and he ended up paying for the shrimp scampi and remaking our 2 dishes for us. But, honestly, I am very disappointed in CPK Mililani... I was expecting way better like the times I've gone before. CPK is one of my favorite restaurants, but this experience was just horrible. We ended up being late to our 9:50 PM movie because we had to wait for the check and remakes. We got seated at 8:30, and were expecting to have a good birthday dinner and then a quick dessert but it turned out not so good... The waitress was nice and we appreciate the effort of remaking our orders even if the pasta for the shrimp scampi remake with no zucchini was undercooked. We will definitely be coming back in the future, but we just hope that they will improve their service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=140

I was seated outside which I didn't mind at all. The weather was perfect for enjoying a meal. Our server Marty was an amazing server. He constantly came by our table to check on us and made sure everything was going good. Marty had such an easy going vibe to him it made me feel really comfortable while talking to him.

Amber G.,"Mililani, HI",0,2,3,1.0,8/6/2017,"Worst service I've ever had.  I'm a server myself so I tend to not ask for much knowing how it is. There were only three of us. We started off with a small girl I forget her name but she didn't seem to care for us much since she was getting off her shift after taking our orders. Sarah our new server, not introducing herself asked if we needed anything & we had to ask for our bread.  After we ordered, a six top was seated across of us, they received their bread & appetizers before us. We had ordered a spinach artichoke dip as an app & lettuce wraps & pizzas for our entree. Everything came out at the same time, at this point we were super hungry so it was fine.  While eating our server, checked on us like 2 times. We ran out of water half way through & she walked past us like 10 times not looking at us or checking on us. I started to hold up my empty cup & she still didn't look at us for the next 10 minutes. I got up & was about to go up to ask for more water myself when she decided to stop & ask if we needed boxes. With empty cups we asked for more water & continued to eat. She came back with warm water, which also had things floating around. I then seen Danny, a server I had my first time there a few months ago. I asked him if we could get waters with ice & he gladly took our cups & came back with new ones. He's great. By then we were waiting for dessert.  We ordered butter cake with ice cream. Our butter cake was cold & our ice cream was melted. Like I said I'm not hard to please but I can't explain how bad service was. Sarah kept apologizing that it was busy but it really wasn't. There was another lady that looked annoyed with our server as well. We spent two hours there... waiting on unnecessary things.

Upon eating our food less than 10 minutes later we discovered that the pasta was cold and the portion of added chicken was less than adequate.

My salad had a FLY in it!  The bartender happened to walk up right as I discovered it and quickly removed it. Yuck!   There were 2 bartenders so they both asked at different times if someone had spoken to me. Which the answer was no!   It took the manager about 15-20 mins to speak with me at which time, I was pretty much full and did not want a replacement salad.  When the manager finally came over, he apologized and said he was comping the salad (duh I barely touched it before I found the critter in there) and would give me a replacement which I didn't want.

Jameson I.,"Aiea, HI",13,77,71,1.0,5/14/2017,My girlfriend and I love going to CPK especially since Costco sales the gift cards it makes it so worth it. This location is fairly new and you can definitely tell by how the workers are so inexperienced and don't know too much information about the menu or policy.  First off we asked about gluten free and they said that they have a gluten free menu and whatever is on that menu is the only thing gluten. I could tell my their demeanor they weren't 100% sure and later found out there were more gluten free items and told them about it n they tried to make up an excuse but no problem just wished they asked someone else if they were not 100% sure.  Second when trying to use two of our pizza dough points because on one we had a $5 reward and on the other we had a birthday dessert and the waitress insisted that we couldn't and I had to explain that the ala moana location allowed us to w no problem but I understand that this location is very new and they're still learning but that goes back to what I was saying earlier all u gotta to do is ask if you're not sure. Eventually she did ask the manager and the manager allowed it.  Food was good but please guys if you're not sure just ask someone that does. To me it's all about the customer experience. Will probably come back in a year or so hopefully by than they will have learned the ropes.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=20
Steven K.,"Mililani, HI",39,195,1,2.0,10/16/2017,"I have been to this particular CPK several times since they opened.  It has never been my first choice, but I have friends who like it.  It might be because it's new, but there is always a wait.  Just short of 40 minutes on this trip.  We were waiting on the Mauka side of the building, and there were 4-5 tables, that were not even being used, i found that odd.  Once we got seated, we were served right away. We made the fatal mistake of ordering our PuPu's and entree at the same time, so, surprise, surprise, they showed up at the same time. I don't know if it was the kitchens or Brooke (our waitress) fault.  She was spot on with everything else.    Ordered the Garlic Cream Fettuccine, it was really salty. I enjoy salty, but this was pushing even my limits. I wont ever order it again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=20
Jennifer L.,"Mililani, HI",294,278,525,4.0,4/20/2017,"I was super impressed with the service here for just opening this location.  Normally there is a learning curve for a new restaurant, but CPK Mililani proved to be consistent in their customer service, regardless of location. The dining area feels super hip, with lots of covered outdoor seating and wood panels and artsy photos along the walls.  We sat inside and the restaurant was bustling with about a million servers ready to assist.  My only comment is that the lighting is so low, I could barely see!  During the day I would imagine its much better, but when you have to bust out your cell phone light just to read the menu, you know its bad. I had the new bowls advertised on the menu insert.  My bahn mi quinoa bowl, in my head, was kind of like a bi bim bap with quinoa, but when it arrived it was basically a salad with a measly scoop of quinoa mixed in.   Kind of disappointed, but not a night-ruiner.  Great job Mililani in bringing in another much needed food establishment to break up the mundane dining options here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=20

Mililani and the Kapolei location have the ability to text you when your table is ready! So when you have to wait for an hour and 15 mins on a Friday night you can go home and relax! Well that's what I did... The 2nd time I went my bf and I were able to get seated right away on the smaller lanai. We did go on a weekday around 6. Our server, Ashley was great! We bonded over our love of dogs! We ordered the spinach & artichoke dip, BBQ chicken pizza, alfredo with chicken and shrimp and lastly the butter cake. Everything was yummy as expected!

And she cleared our appetizer plates without asking us. We were done with them but it had a fork on it so we had to wait around for her to come back and ask for another fork. When I asked for one she was like ""you need another fork?"" super sassy. And I said ""uhhhh yeah because you took ours away."" and lastly, she was forcing dessert on us.

Then the '3' service staff continued to go through our bags, check the ticket, go to the freezer, come back, go to the kitchen, come back and finally said our order was ready to go. Drove home only ONLY TO FIND OUT order was totally messed up, no tortilla soup, no pizza toppings, no dipping sauce for egg rolls, no ice cream 2 times for desserts, a total of over $25 was missing!!! SO WE DROVE BACK, only to find still packed restaurant and this time 7 people in line waiting for their orders. Not going to spend over 2 hours waiting for their inexperienced staff to go through our receipts, go through the bags and look at each other blankly on what to do. WE GAVE UP.  Suggestion to not have the beverage area so close to the take out line; service staff were going back and forth constantly doing the water/tea what ever and it was crowded.

I ordered the shrimp scampi linguine while my hubby ordered the penne pasta. When I received my linguine dish, my first impression was ""holy shit, wheres the rest of it?"" Presentation was spot on, texture was great. I poked my fork in it, I couldnt believe how much linguine they DIDNT give. I swear I only had 3/4 cup of noodles. And for linguine being a little fat size, it was very little. Dont get me wrong peeps, the pasta had lot of flavor but $16+ it wasnt worth it. I can go to Ricados or Bravos to get a mich bigger size meal at that price. The penne pasta was a bit bland but was served a good portion.

General Manager's attention that I have spent over$200 at this location since they opened and never received my rewards. She admitted that they have been having problems since they opened (3 months ago) and are working on fixing the glitch, but she wouldn't even comp me a soda or free meal. She said it was my fault for not punching in HI as the location. When I tried that, it STILL did NOT work. Also, the waitress Cami did not refill our drinks and took a long time to serve us. Another server brought our plates to the table and the food was COLD! The rewards are equivalent to $ if you think about it. I just lost out on approx. $20 by coming to this restaurant. $20 here and there can add up quickly being that I am a regular customer or was one. I refuse to patronize this restaurant. My friends are also not coming here any more. Bad customer service! Then they expect you to have kept all your past receipts and fill out forms when you give them feedback just to inconvenience you some more. I'd rather go to Assagio's and pay a little more for better quality food and WAY better service.

Everytime we come here, we're always seated at the very same booth right next to the restroom. Honestly, we didn't care but the last time we went; service was so bad. It was one of my coworker's last day with our company, and her food took forever and it came out last. Their food is always on point, dont get me wrong. But if you're seated kind of far away from everything, you start to feel like service isn't going to be as good; unless your table is closer to everything. I had their Spicy Kung Pao Spaghetti with Shrimp. It was super good. Usually, a server would offer me grated cheese; but this time I wasn't. I had to flag down another server(which I hate doing because I'm in the service industry) to grate cheese for my Spaghetti. My boss had the Arugala Salad, my other coworkers had the warm Veggies, Pepporoni Pizza & a Caeser salad. The Arugala salad & warm Veggies came out last. Our waters were not refilled, nor was our table properly bussed. I had to stack our plates for our waitress. I loved coming here, hoping to receive better service next time.

Joy S.,"Honolulu, HI",87,53,101,2.0,11/11/2017,"Should I start with the good news, or the bad? I've always been a fan of CPK. They do a good job of meeting the tastes of a variety of needs. I appreciate that they add and change items on the menu, rather than relying on reputation alone. That being said, I've never had a phenomenal server there, but I've also never had terrible service. Today was a much different experience.  I believe the restaurant was short staffed. It appeared they were specifically short busboys. There were several tables sitting with empty plates, waiting to be cleaned. We were told our wait for a table would be 10-15 minutes. We waited closer to 25 minutes, and my guess is because the tables weren't being cleared.  This was at 2:30 in the afternoon, which in my opinion, isn't necessarily a peak time.  Upon sitting, we never got utensils, and it took 10 minutes for our server to come and take our order. I can't tell you how long we waited for our food, but our entire experience, from waiting in line to paying our chit took 2.5 hours! We weren't lallygagging and taking up time talking...we spent much of our time waiting.  When our food came, still no utensils. I had to walk to the bar and ask for place settings and a pitcher of water, since our waters weren't being refilled. I have no problem if you're short staffed. But it's unprofessional if a server doesn't inform you of that.  I was very disappointed with my experience at the Mililani CPK. They aren't nearly as busy as the Ala Moana, Pearlridge, or Kahala locations, and still had trouble keeping up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3

My boys went to pick up the food around 7:15 pm because I just had surgery and could not go out to get it myself. They were told the order was not put in so they would have to wait longer and ended up waiting till 8:04 pm to get our food! The staff was rude and nothing discounted for the super long wait and their error!!! CPK is lucky I can't go anywhere so couldn't go to pick up the food because if I was there, I would not have put up with this and went elsewhere! To top it all off, all the food was COLD!!!

It's nice that they have the option of sitting outside and since it was such a nice day we decided to enjoy our meal outdoors.  The food is never disappointing and like everyone else we definitely have our favorites. Today we went with a couple pizzas, the chicken piccata pasta, wild seared ahi, ahi spring rolls, Cobb salad and lettuce wraps. As usual everything was as delicious as we remembered. Our server was pleasant and kept our waters full throughout the entire meal. I'm a true believer of CPK and always look forward to eating here.

Today, we waited 25 minutes for a table (while many tables were empty), 10 minutes to be greeted by our server which by then we were ready to order our drinks, appetizers, and meals.  Appetizer comes out with one pair of chopsticks. For our family of four.  Oh and the hostess sat us down with NO SILVERWARE and guess what?! No one noticed throughout our whole meal and forget asking the server bc we rarely caught a glimpse of her. Which means during our wait we were hangrily munching on the bread but had to save some of the soft pieces to wipe my daughter's mouth!!!  Seriously?!  So my kids' pizzas finally come out, then my husband's banh mi bowl comes out so we're waiting for my food. Waiting..waiting...waiting.  You would think I ordered the most complicated dish but finally my half order of a cobb salad comes out. And i tried my best to enjoy it.  Using the chopsticks from our appetizer.  My husband took over.  He grabbed our napkins, silverware, boxes and handed the check over to a possible manager that came by.

I've done take out now a few times. I love that they have stalls in front for quick pick up. Downfall is that not everyone adheres to the signs and parks there anyway. I feel like quality is sometimes hit or not as good. I don't want to say miss because it's not a total blunder. For example, I've ordered a salad. Ordered it again a different time and it tasted different.  Also, ordered a power bowl once and it didn't taste dressed at all. I asked the server who said it was dressed. She said she could get more dressing then came back to say they ran out of dressing (??). She did offer to bring another type but it's weird that she thought it was dressed in the first place and then they didn't even have any period? Some fun drinks running about $8-10 each - yum!

Nette B.,"San Diego, CA",1627,1011,2000,4.0,8/22/2017,"I visited here twice when I was on vacation because my family just HAD to come here.  CPK is a chain so to me everything is the same. Had the BBQ Chicken Salad, Chicken and Shrimp Alfredo and Pizzas. The pasta was al dente (which i love) and the flavors were all there.  Pizza was delicious as usual.  My family ordered a few other dishes that i tasted that was yummy too.  The server we had was all wrong. Meaning, from the time we sat he rubbed me and my family the wrong way. Now let me tell you, I've been a Yelp Elite going on 9 years, I dine out every night and I try to be very fair. Being from Hawaii,  I always love the Aloha spirit from servers.  WRONG! I might be wrong with our servers name but I think it was Sean. He had an accent from the mid west or something.  You can tell he was not from Hawaii. When he got to our table he did not smile and looked at my family as if we were bothering him. It was like ""dude, go home. It's been a long day for you.""  We were a table of 14 including kids. When he took our order he did not walk around the table to every adult but stood at the end and yelling from afar. WTF! He even rolled his eyes. There were more body language of being annoyed that he did but I'll leave it at that.  The saving grace of the night was Alana and Kellie. These managers are awesome. Thank you for redeeming the customer service. You two are assets to CPK. If it wasn't for you two,  CPK would've received a 2 1/2 stars because of how our server treated us.  On another night we had a server who was nice and pleasant. Forgot her name but she was from San Diego so we bonded with her. She made a mistake with our order but she owned up to it instead of blaming anyone and I appreciated that. She got a better tip from me. She also offered pizza dough to the kids on our table. See, that was already better customer service.  Great job young lady.

First off, I visited this location a month back with a friend for dinner and was not impressed, but it was dinner time and they were a little busy. So I decided to give it another try for a late lunch this time. We came on Sunday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all. We waited at the front hostess stand for a few minutes before someone came out to seat us.  We were greeted by our server and she brought our waters and took our appetizer order. When she came back with our appetizer we ordered a pizza to share. Fast forward 40 minutes and after finishing our spinach and artichoke dip our pizza was still not at our table. We also needed to ask for refills on water because no one checked in on our table. We were seated right behind the bar so there were lots of servers walking pass and a manager walking the floor as well. Our server only came to our table 2 times and one of those time we had to call her over.  We noticed that others around us got their food before us, but we thought maybe the pizza was taking a little longer.  Well, to our surprise our server comes back to our table and says ""I'm sorry could I take your order again, we closed out your check."" WTH!? How do you close out someone's check who didn't even get their food? Already annoyed and not wanting to wait we asked to actually close out the check this time and we were going to pay for our dip.

Yesterday, I decided that they'd had enough time to train their staff, so I ordered 2 pizzas online with only a 15 minute wait. I went to pick up the pizzas and showed them the email from the manager. The take-out counter called the on-duty manager, who checked my email and credited the two pizzas on the spot. I'm pleased to say that they now represent CPK well. The thin-crust Jerk Chicken had a great hot & sweet flavor, while the traditional crust The Works was very good as well. Both were baked just right.  Had this been my first visit, I would give them 4 stars, but we'll call it 3.5 for now. This place is definitely back on the food radar.

Why only 4 stars?  Waitress couldn't name all the beers they had.  We had to specifically asked if they carried Firestone or New Belgium.  And yes, we did order Firestone's 805.  Also, our appetizers arrived at our table the same time as our main course.  That should have hinted to what was going to come up next. We had barely started on our main course when one worker asked if we wanted boxes to take home left overs.  Replied that we were still working on our meals.  A short time later another worker came by and asked us again.  Yes, we were still eating but let her box up a few of our meals.  I can understand that they want to serve new customers as soon as possible for greater revenue but when we paid and was leaving there was no one waiting. On the positive note, we received our second order of complimentary bread and my 2nd glass of Strawberry Lemonade was served before I completed my first.  We enjoy eating at CPK and will be back....hopefully we will feel ""welcomed"" and ""not rushed"" the next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3

Tip: if the wait is long you can put your name and number down, leave and they will contact you when your table is ready.  The server I had was Ashley and she was awesome. She was very friendly and consistently came back to check on me and made sure my water was always filled and I had everything I needed.

Chevelle D.,"Ewa Beach, HI",13,45,150,5.0,3/28/2017,"Today was the second day of the new California Pizza Kitchen in Mililani being open and it was great! We went for lunch so we were seated within 5-10 minutes. The hostess Dakota was awesome and very helpful in getting us checked in.  Once inside, the decor was great; much like the new CPK in Kapolei. It's so great to no longer see only black, white and yellow tile everywhere. They also had beautiful pictures of Hawaii all over the walls and surfboards mounted near the bar. The booth seating, which we got, was extremely comfortable and there was a TV in the area we were sitting as well. The bar looked like a well stocked bar and had a decent amount of seating which is always great! They also have two TV's mounted for all you avid sports fans! The staff was extremely friendly and everyone took the time to stop and check on us, including the managers. While I appreciate attentive service, getting checked on every two minutes can be a little much, especially when you're trying to have a conversation. Overall, awesome service though! Everyone is really nice and willing to get you what you need even if they're not your server.  We ordered some La Marca Prosecco to start (be advised there is a small portion that you can order listed in the menu; the general manager tried to say that we could only order it by the full size bottle, but there is a 6 oz. available!). We then ordered the white corn guacamole and bianco flatbread for appetizers, which was delicious! The guacamole did need more salt, but it's available at the table for you.  For the main course we ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Santa Fe salad which is on the seasonal portion of the menu and currently only available at the Mililani location because the other CPK's have not gotten it yet! The Santa Fe salad was delicious! It has spinach, farro, red cabbage, avocado, beans, corn, shaved peppers and grilled chicken with a jalapeño ranch dressing. The BBQ pizza was delicious as always and all of our food came out fairly quickly! For dessert we ordered the salted caramel pudding which was delicious as always. It seemed like the pudding didn't get enough time to set, as the pudding was slightly runny and not quite pudding yet. Nonetheless, it was still good.

I'm thinking, ""Wow!  This is the fastest service we received.""  Our server moved swiftly.  We placed our orders from beverages, salad and entree at once.  We couldn't believe our eyes when all beverages and complimentary bread with olive oil came in a jiffy.  Fusilli pasta reached the table within five minutes.  Next, BBQ chicken chopped salad and to our surprise, The Works Pizza was ready.  Bim!  Bam!  Boom!  We kindly asked another Server that brought salad and pizza out together if she will be able to keep our pizza warm, then bring it to us five minutes later so we can enjoy our salad.  Other server seemed hesitant and didn't provide a direct response.  My husband said, ""That's alright.""  We consumed all of the salad.  Sad thing is by the time we were ready to eat The Works, it was partially warm and almost cold.  I only ate one slice of pizza.

I wish we would've  gone elsewhere for lunch.  I won't be coming back.  I don't think the management  at this location is that good.  The service and food here need some serious help.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3
Angel D.,"Honolulu, United States",253,335,1376,2.0,3/1/2018,"My boss always takes me and my coworker here for lunch every now and then. Everytime we come here, we're always seated at the very same booth right next to the restroom. Honestly, we didn't care but the last time we went; service was so bad. It was one of my coworker's last day with our company, and her food took forever and it came out last. Their food is always on point, dont get me wrong. But if you're seated kind of far away from everything, you start to feel like service isn't going to be as good; unless your table is closer to everything. I had their Spicy Kung Pao Spaghetti with Shrimp. It was super good. Usually, a server would offer me grated cheese; but this time I wasn't. I had to flag down another server(which I hate doing because I'm in the service industry) to grate cheese for my Spaghetti. My boss had the Arugala Salad, my other coworkers had the warm Veggies, Pepporoni Pizza & a Caeser salad. The Arugala salad & warm Veggies came out last. Our waters were not refilled, nor was our table properly bussed. I had to stack our plates for our waitress. I loved coming here, hoping to receive better service next time. Everything took so long that day.... the food, the check, everything. Definitely will give this place another try, maybe in a year.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3
Jon S.,"Cleveland, United States",2,51,84,2.0,7/1/2018,"Food: Typical CPK so 2.5 stars... fairly good pizza but I was disappointed in the piadina. The description is ""a folded pizza-style sandwich"". It was literally a cooked pizza they folded in half. WHAT?! Ugh. They also didn't tell me the side soup or salad was included and it wasn't called out on the menu. Service: Very slow - 1 star. They also forgot one of the starter spinach artichoke dips and one of our groups sandwiches. They comped the sandwich.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3
Joy S.,"Honolulu, United States",87,53,101,2.0,11/11/2017,"Should I start with the good news, or the bad? I've always been a fan of CPK. They do a good job of meeting the tastes of a variety of needs. I appreciate that they add and change items on the menu, rather than relying on reputation alone. That being said, I've never had a phenomenal server there, but I've also never had terrible service. Today was a much different experience.  I believe the restaurant was short staffed. It appeared they were specifically short busboys. There were several tables sitting with empty plates, waiting to be cleaned. We were told our wait for a table would be 10-15 minutes. We waited closer to 25 minutes, and my guess is because the tables weren't being cleared.  This was at 2:30 in the afternoon, which in my opinion, isn't necessarily a peak time.  Upon sitting, we never got utensils, and it took 10 minutes for our server to come and take our order. I can't tell you how long we waited for our food, but our entire experience, from waiting in line to paying our chit took 2.5 hours! We weren't lallygagging and taking up time talking...we spent much of our time waiting.  When our food came, still no utensils. I had to walk to the bar and ask for place settings and a pitcher of water, since our waters weren't being refilled. I have no problem if you're short staffed. But it's unprofessional if a server doesn't inform you of that.  I was very disappointed with my experience at the Mililani CPK. They aren't nearly as busy as the Ala Moana, Pearlridge, or Kahala locations, and still had trouble keeping up.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3

Ordered by phone with Monica (person who took my order) at 6:43 pm, call took 4 minutes, I was told to pick up the food in 20 minutes. My boys went to pick up the food around 7:15 pm because I just had surgery and could not go out to get it myself. They were told the order was not put in so they would have to wait longer and ended up waiting till 8:04 pm to get our food! The staff was rude and nothing discounted for the super long wait and their error!!! CPK is lucky I can't go anywhere so couldn't go to pick up the food because if I was there, I would not have put up with this and went elsewhere! To top it all off, all the food was COLD!!! Which means the Pizza and Pasta was sitting a long time before they gave my boys the food!!! RIDICULOUS!!!

It's nice that they have the option of sitting outside and since it was such a nice day we decided to enjoy our meal outdoors.  The food is never disappointing and like everyone else we definitely have our favorites. Today we went with a couple pizzas, the chicken piccata pasta, wild seared ahi, ahi spring rolls, Cobb salad and lettuce wraps. As usual everything was as delicious as we remembered. Our server was pleasant and kept our waters full throughout the entire meal. I'm a true believer of CPK and always look forward to eating here.

Now, the food would be a lot more enjoyable if the service was better. But we've been to this location several times and have experienced terrible service EVERY time. Today, we waited 25 minutes for a table (while many tables were empty), 10 minutes to be greeted by our server which by then we were ready to order our drinks, appetizers, and meals.  Appetizer comes out with one pair of chopsticks. For our family of four.  Oh and the hostess sat us down with NO SILVERWARE and guess what?! No one noticed throughout our whole meal and forget asking the server bc we rarely caught a glimpse of her. Which means during our wait we were hangrily munching on the bread but had to save some of the soft pieces to wipe my daughter's mouth!!!  Seriously?!  So my kids' pizzas finally come out, then my husband's banh mi bowl comes out so we're waiting for my food. Waiting..waiting...waiting.  You would think I ordered the most complicated dish but finally my half order of a cobb salad comes out. And i tried my best to enjoy it.  Using the chopsticks from our appetizer.  My husband took over.  He grabbed our napkins, silverware, boxes and handed the check over to a possible manager that came by.

I HATE THAT. taking our orders, she cut us off when we're talking. when she's putting down our waters, she just pushes things out of the way to make room.  i almost felt like the water was going to fall. when checking on us, she would give us .5 second to answer. when we were going to put in our order, i had to take a second so she just goes ""i can come back"". but its like NO i said i neeeded a second....not for you to leave and come back.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3
Jenel O.,"Waipahu, United States",209,359,475,4.0,29/9/2017,"So excited that CPK opened in Mililani! I love coming here. Although is it just me or did prices overall increase all CPKs?  I've done take out now a few times. I love that they have stalls in front for quick pick up. Downfall is that not everyone adheres to the signs and parks there anyway. I feel like quality is sometimes hit or not as good. I don't want to say miss because it's not a total blunder. For example, I've ordered a salad. Ordered it again a different time and it tasted different.  Also, ordered a power bowl once and it didn't taste dressed at all. I asked the server who said it was dressed. She said she could get more dressing then came back to say they ran out of dressing (??). She did offer to bring another type but it's weird that she thought it was dressed in the first place and then they didn't even have any period? Some fun drinks running about $8-10 each - yum! I'll definitely be back though. Can't go wrong with their pizzas, pastas and salads.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3
Nette B.,"San Diego, United States",1627,1011,2000,4.0,22/8/2017,"I visited here twice when I was on vacation because my family just HAD to come here.  CPK is a chain so to me everything is the same. Had the BBQ Chicken Salad, Chicken and Shrimp Alfredo and Pizzas. The pasta was al dente (which i love) and the flavors were all there.  Pizza was delicious as usual.  My family ordered a few other dishes that i tasted that was yummy too.  The server we had was all wrong. Meaning, from the time we sat he rubbed me and my family the wrong way. Now let me tell you, I've been a Yelp Elite going on 9 years, I dine out every night and I try to be very fair. Being from Hawaii,  I always love the Aloha spirit from servers.  WRONG! I might be wrong with our servers name but I think it was Sean. He had an accent from the mid west or something.  You can tell he was not from Hawaii. When he got to our table he did not smile and looked at my family as if we were bothering him. It was like ""dude, go home. It's been a long day for you.""  We were a table of 14 including kids. When he took our order he did not walk around the table to every adult but stood at the end and yelling from afar. WTF! He even rolled his eyes. There were more body language of being annoyed that he did but I'll leave it at that.  The saving grace of the night was Alana and Kellie. These managers are awesome. Thank you for redeeming the customer service. You two are assets to CPK. If it wasn't for you two,  CPK would've received a 2 1/2 stars because of how our server treated us.  On another night we had a server who was nice and pleasant. Forgot her name but she was from San Diego so we bonded with her. She made a mistake with our order but she owned up to it instead of blaming anyone and I appreciated that. She got a better tip from me. She also offered pizza dough to the kids on our table. See, that was already better customer service.  Great job young lady. Overall, I'd return despite of my negative experience with 1 server.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3

Toni P.,"Waialua, United States",182,56,92,1.0,30/7/2017,"Hmmmmm.... what to say? First off, I visited this location a month back with a friend for dinner and was not impressed, but it was dinner time and they were a little busy. So I decided to give it another try for a late lunch this time. We came on Sunday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all. We waited at the front hostess stand for a few minutes before someone came out to seat us.  We were greeted by our server and she brought our waters and took our appetizer order. When she came back with our appetizer we ordered a pizza to share. Fast forward 40 minutes and after finishing our spinach and artichoke dip our pizza was still not at our table. We also needed to ask for refills on water because no one checked in on our table. We were seated right behind the bar so there were lots of servers walking pass and a manager walking the floor as well. Our server only came to our table 2 times and one of those time we had to call her over.  We noticed that others around us got their food before us, but we thought maybe the pizza was taking a little longer.  Well, to our surprise our server comes back to our table and says ""I'm sorry could I take your order again, we closed out your check."" WTH!? How do you close out someone's check who didn't even get their food? Already annoyed and not wanting to wait we asked to actually close out the check this time and we were going to pay for our dip. The server said that they would take care of it and apologized for the issue.  CPK- get it together. You weren't even busy.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3
Don T.,"O‘ahu, United States",3,47,12,3.0,15/10/2017,"After being contacted by the manager and receiving credit for 2 free pizzas, I thought I owed them an update. Yesterday, I decided that they'd had enough time to train their staff, so I ordered 2 pizzas online with only a 15 minute wait. I went to pick up the pizzas and showed them the email from the manager. The take-out counter called the on-duty manager, who checked my email and credited the two pizzas on the spot. I'm pleased to say that they now represent CPK well. The thin-crust Jerk Chicken had a great hot & sweet flavor, while the traditional crust The Works was very good as well. Both were baked just right.  Had this been my first visit, I would give them 4 stars, but we'll call it 3.5 for now. This place is definitely back on the food radar.

Why only 4 stars?  Waitress couldn't name all the beers they had.  We had to specifically asked if they carried Firestone or New Belgium.  And yes, we did order Firestone's 805.  Also, our appetizers arrived at our table the same time as our main course.  That should have hinted to what was going to come up next. We had barely started on our main course when one worker asked if we wanted boxes to take home left overs.  Replied that we were still working on our meals.  A short time later another worker came by and asked us again.  Yes, we were still eating but let her box up a few of our meals.  I can understand that they want to serve new customers as soon as possible for greater revenue but when we paid and was leaving there was no one waiting. On the positive note, we received our second order of complimentary bread and my 2nd glass of Strawberry Lemonade was served before I completed my first.  We enjoy eating at CPK and will be back....hopefully we will feel ""welcomed"" and ""not rushed"" the next time.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3

I expected to wait because this place is so new, however to my surprise they had seating on the lanai. It wasn't that bad because the sun was going down and I was seated away from the sun where it was shaded.  Tip: if the wait is long you can put your name and number down, leave and they will contact you when your table is ready.  The server I had was Ashley and she was awesome. She was very friendly and consistently came back to check on me and made sure my water was always filled and I had everything I needed. She also made a great recommendation on the dessert (butter cake w/ ice cream). It was delicious!!  As expected the food was excellent!

Chevelle D.,"Ewa Beach, United States",13,45,150,5.0,28/3/2017,"Today was the second day of the new California Pizza Kitchen in Mililani being open and it was great! We went for lunch so we were seated within 5-10 minutes. The hostess Dakota was awesome and very helpful in getting us checked in.  Once inside, the decor was great; much like the new CPK in Kapolei. It's so great to no longer see only black, white and yellow tile everywhere. They also had beautiful pictures of Hawaii all over the walls and surfboards mounted near the bar. The booth seating, which we got, was extremely comfortable and there was a TV in the area we were sitting as well. The bar looked like a well stocked bar and had a decent amount of seating which is always great! They also have two TV's mounted for all you avid sports fans! The staff was extremely friendly and everyone took the time to stop and check on us, including the managers. While I appreciate attentive service, getting checked on every two minutes can be a little much, especially when you're trying to have a conversation. Overall, awesome service though! Everyone is really nice and willing to get you what you need even if they're not your server.  We ordered some La Marca Prosecco to start (be advised there is a small portion that you can order listed in the menu; the general manager tried to say that we could only order it by the full size bottle, but there is a 6 oz. available!). We then ordered the white corn guacamole and bianco flatbread for appetizers, which was delicious! The guacamole did need more salt, but it's available at the table for you.  For the main course we ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Santa Fe salad which is on the seasonal portion of the menu and currently only available at the Mililani location because the other CPK's have not gotten it yet! The Santa Fe salad was delicious! It has spinach, farro, red cabbage, avocado, beans, corn, shaved peppers and grilled chicken with a jalapeño ranch dressing. The BBQ pizza was delicious as always and all of our food came out fairly quickly! For dessert we ordered the salted caramel pudding which was delicious as always. It seemed like the pudding didn't get enough time to set, as the pudding was slightly runny and not quite pudding yet. Nonetheless, it was still good.  Overall, great experience, great vibe and great energy from the staff! I highly recommend stopping by!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3

I'm thinking, ""Wow!  This is the fastest service we received.""  Our server moved swiftly.  We placed our orders from beverages, salad and entree at once.  We couldn't believe our eyes when all beverages and complimentary bread with olive oil came in a jiffy.  Fusilli pasta reached the table within five minutes.  Next, BBQ chicken chopped salad and to our surprise, The Works Pizza was ready.  Bim!  Bam!  Boom!  We kindly asked another Server that brought salad and pizza out together if she will be able to keep our pizza warm, then bring it to us five minutes later so we can enjoy our salad.  Other server seemed hesitant and didn't provide a direct response.  My husband said, ""That's alright.""  We consumed all of the salad.  Sad thing is by the time we were ready to eat The Works, it was partially warm and almost cold.  I only ate one slice of pizza.

We started off with a small girl I forget her name but she didn't seem to care for us much since she was getting off her shift after taking our orders. Sarah our new server, not introducing herself asked if we needed anything & we had to ask for our bread.  After we ordered, a six top was seated across of us, they received their bread & appetizers before us. We had ordered a spinach artichoke dip as an app & lettuce wraps & pizzas for our entree. Everything came out at the same time, at this point we were super hungry so it was fine.  While eating our server, checked on us like 2 times. We ran out of water half way through & she walked past us like 10 times not looking at us or checking on us. I started to hold up my empty cup & she still didn't look at us for the next 10 minutes. I got up & was about to go up to ask for more water myself when she decided to stop & ask if we needed boxes. With empty cups we asked for more water & continued to eat. She came back with warm water, which also had things floating around. I then seen Danny, a server I had my first time there a few months ago. I asked him if we could get waters with ice & he gladly took our cups & came back with new ones. He's great. By then we were waiting for dessert.  We ordered butter cake with ice cream. Our butter cake was cold & our ice cream was melted. Like I said I'm not hard to please but I can't explain how bad service was. Sarah kept apologizing that it was busy but it really wasn't.

Upon eating our food less than 10 minutes later we discovered that the pasta was cold and the portion of added chicken was less than adequate. My kids pepperoni pizza was almost orange due to the excessive amount of grease. It was also cold and hard as a rock. It was so hard that I could bang the crust on the table like a drum stick. It was very disappointing. The worst part was that we were starving. It was so bad that my husband couldn't eat all is food which is unheard of.

Kawai H.,"Waipio, United States",320,53,101,5.0,11/7/2017,"I've been to this new Mililani location twice since it's opened and honestly don't have anything negative to say about it. Of course, I typically eat at off-times (slow hours, when it's not busy) so there's no excuse for bad service. Lol. Kidding. Or am I?  Anyway..  Any CPK I go to, I tend to get the same things. Shrimp scampi zucchini is my normal, and is equally great here as it is at the other locations. We shared a spinach artichoke dip and my daughter had a cheese pizza, both good! My soda & water was always filled, and we were constantly checked on.  Today we had Chanelle who was very pleasant and efficient! Last time we went I think we had a guy named Juliano (sp?) who was also a great server.  Side note, their bar area is really nice! Looks like a good place to relax for happy hour (if that's something they offer). I haven't had a chance to sit there but I like the way it's set up.

This evenings experience was horrific.  The service was great. We sat at the bar as we were told when we walked up to host (at 5:30p mind you) that they are filling up and we had the option to sit at the bar since it was full service.  I ordered Asparagus and Arugula salad as well as Avo Club Egg Rolls. Hubby ordered Barbecue Chix Pizza. My salad had a FLY in it!  The bartender happened to walk up right as I discovered it and quickly removed it. Yuck!   There were 2 bartenders so they both asked at different times if someone had spoken to me. Which the answer was no!   It took the manager about 15-20 mins to speak with me at which time, I was pretty much full and did not want a replacement salad.  When the manager finally came over, he apologized and said he was comping the salad (duh I barely touched it before I found the critter in there) and would give me a replacement which I didn't want.  We finished what we had ordered and got another round of drinks. Then we got dessert, strawberry shortcake with ice cream which is as yummy! Then...  the light bar under the bar fell on my knee (OUCH!).

Tip: they do not make Lava Flows unlike pearlridge location. Ordered our usual Jambalaya and it tasted kind of funky/different. Will definitely give them 6 months-1year or so til I'll try this location again. Our horrible experience was somewhat relieved by the manager.

Jameson I.,"Aiea, United States",13,77,71,1.0,14/5/2017,My girlfriend and I love going to CPK especially since Costco sales the gift cards it makes it so worth it. This location is fairly new and you can definitely tell by how the workers are so inexperienced and don't know too much information about the menu or policy.  First off we asked about gluten free and they said that they have a gluten free menu and whatever is on that menu is the only thing gluten. I could tell my their demeanor they weren't 100% sure and later found out there were more gluten free items and told them about it n they tried to make up an excuse but no problem just wished they asked someone else if they were not 100% sure.  Second when trying to use two of our pizza dough points because on one we had a $5 reward and on the other we had a birthday dessert and the waitress insisted that we couldn't and I had to explain that the ala moana location allowed us to w no problem but I understand that this location is very new and they're still learning but that goes back to what I was saying earlier all u gotta to do is ask if you're not sure. Eventually she did ask the manager and the manager allowed it.  Food was good but please guys if you're not sure just ask someone that does. To me it's all about the customer experience. Will probably come back in a year or so hopefully by than they will have learned the ropes.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=20

We made the fatal mistake of ordering our PuPu's and entree at the same time, so, surprise, surprise, they showed up at the same time. I don't know if it was the kitchens or Brooke (our waitress) fault.  She was spot on with everything else.    Ordered the Garlic Cream Fettuccine, it was really salty.

Jennifer L.,"Mililani, United States",294,278,525,4.0,20/4/2017,"I was super impressed with the service here for just opening this location.  Normally there is a learning curve for a new restaurant, but CPK Mililani proved to be consistent in their customer service, regardless of location. The dining area feels super hip, with lots of covered outdoor seating and wood panels and artsy photos along the walls.  We sat inside and the restaurant was bustling with about a million servers ready to assist.  My only comment is that the lighting is so low, I could barely see!  During the day I would imagine its much better, but when you have to bust out your cell phone light just to read the menu, you know its bad. I had the new bowls advertised on the menu insert.  My bahn mi quinoa bowl, in my head, was kind of like a bi bim bap with quinoa, but when it arrived it was basically a salad with a measly scoop of quinoa mixed in.   Kind of disappointed, but not a night-ruiner.  Great job Mililani in bringing in another much needed food establishment to break up the mundane dining options here!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=20

Well that's what I did... The 2nd time I went my bf and I were able to get seated right away on the smaller lanai. We did go on a weekday around 6. Our server, Ashley was great! We bonded over our love of dogs! We ordered the spinach & artichoke dip, BBQ chicken pizza, alfredo with chicken and shrimp and lastly the butter cake. Everything was yummy as expected!

The decor is the typical CPK, and everything is new and clean. You can sit outside (what used to be the sidewalk area), or inside. But depending on the time of day, if you choose to sit outside, you could be in the sun.  So maybe check it out as you're going in as it could affect where you choose to sit. Food can pretty quickly and yup, tasted like how I expected. Consistent CPK fare and presentation.

Lauren Y.,"Honolulu, United States",59,17,1,2.0,19/9/2017,"I'm a frequent flyer at CPK, however after my first experience at CPK Mililani, I'm afraid it will be my last. The only thing that substantiates the one extra star from the minimum would be the bartender who was working that night, who was really pleasant and professional.  After expecting this visit to go like any other CPK visit I've ever had, I ordered the usual (pesto cream penne, add chicken - YUM) and although the restaurant was not packed full, I did expect a wait as there was a decent amount of people in there. As we sat at the bar, my two friends and I received and finished our first round of drinks before bread came out. After ordering and finishing another round, we grew a little concerned. We looked around, and saw everyone who had ordered after us, already enjoying their meals.  We then checked in the the bartender, who said our food would be out any minute. Guess there was a mix up in the kitchen. Eh, it happens. Another round of drinks go by... still nothing. We ask the bartender again if she knows anything about our food. She says she will send someone to check on it again. The woman returns and apologizes, and lets us know our food will be out any minute now... heard that already. About 5 minutes later, we get our food - AND IT'S NOT EVEN HOT. Mind you, it's not ice cold, but it's definitely been sitting out for quite some time. I wouldn't even say it was still warm. At this point, I'm thoroughly annoyed. Then as I'm eating, I notice that there are about a total of 6 small chunks of chicken in my pasta. 6 small bites of chicken for an upcharge of $3 and change? Not right. I've ordered this at Kahala, Ala Moana, Kailua and Pearlridge, and I've never had this little chicken.  I keep my mouth shut per my friends' requests, although I'm fuming on the inside wanting to send all our dishes back to get refired.  On top of that... after waiting over an hour and fifteen minutes for our food to come out... and having the staff be well aware of this and our frustration.... No word from the manager. No discount. No big apology for the bad experience. Just a ""sorry about that"" when the food actually comes out.  Kind of disappointing that you have to make a big scene these days in order to get some kind of gesture from the business to apologize for having you wait, then serving you old food. I was expecting a 10% off or a free dessert or at the very least, the manager coming out and apologizing for the confusion. But sadly, nothing. For that reason, 2 stars. Really the most disappointing CPK experience I've ever had.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=40

But, I decided to chance it and brought my dad here for lunch.  The restaurant itself isn't very big as most of the restaurant is comprised of their large patio. We were greeted by the host who said the wait was 20 minutes. Relived it was only 20 minutes, we decided to wait. While we waited, we checked out the inside of the restaurant and noticed all of the staff that were on duty. We observed the managers checking in on patrons and efficient staff promptly clearing tables. Needless to say, we were impressed.  Before we knew it, it was time to be seated and we were quickly greeted by our server. Since we had time to figure out what we want to eat, we immediately ordered our food. Despite the restaurant being busy, our food arrived rather quickly. While we enjoyed our meal, we were frequently asked how we were doing or if we needed anything. It was really nice to have such friendly and attentive servers.  My experience here today changed my opinion on CPK. I had vowed to not dine at CPK after the bad experiences I had at the Kapolei location. But, not all locations are the same.

Michael M.,"Honolulu, United States",123,38,88,3.0,2/4/2017,"4/1/2017 It's a Saturday night and yes, they're just in their first week of opening.   We checked in with the front table, was told it'll be an hour wait and they will send us a text message when it's ready.   Which is fine, but remind you that there is a few tables that's been open for awhile.  4 tables which could seat 4 people each is open right at this moment.   So we walk around for about 45 mins, and finally come back to see that those 4 tables are still unseated.  We wait a bit more longer and finally decided to check back in with the front table, was told that it would be another 20 mins wait.  What the.....?!?? Are you serious?   As we wait a bit longer, I take a peek inside and there is 3 booths that's open, the same 4 tables that is open. And 2, 6 person tables open. We heard some other people near us also complaining, how come they are taking so long to seat people?   So we finally got a seat. Which took about an hour an a half. As we waited, they brought us the usual bread with oil. We start handing out the plates and from the looks of it, most of it seemed dirty as they had some black and brown spots.   The waitress takes our order. Not gonna mention the whole order. Anyways, we got the appetizers and we got most of our drinks. Well just the waters.  About 20 mins later, were still wondering where is our other soft drinks. I guess the waitress forgot what we ordered and asked us what we ordered.  We get our order, which the food is great. After we're almost done eating.  The waitress asks us if we need to box our leftovers, which we said yes.  A few of our cups of drinks is all empty. I mention to the waitress we need more drinks. She nods her head and walks away going to pack our leftovers. After she packs all of it. She asks us if we need a desert menu. I said no, but could we get more refills please. She then reacts and was like ""oh I'm sorry I forgot. What did you order again?"" Overall, customer service wasn't up to par as the other CPK. Food on the other hand was excellent.  If customer service was better (hoping they will get better) I would of gave 5 stars but knocked off two stars cause of it.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=40

The waitress we had was polite, and had gotten refills on our drinks in a really fast manner which was great and answered whatever questions we had. I ordered the Wild Mushroom Strozapretti and hey it sounds pretty fancy, I love mushrooms and pasta so I mean this has to be the perfect dish. The food came out and I was really excited. I liked it the only things about it were the fact that the pasta was undercooked in a chewy tough way, and this may be me being picky but inside the pasta there is fresh thyme and looking at it it's basically stick figures in there that just have a tough texture that you're trying to swallow. Overall, experience was nice the staff was polite and welcoming just the food may need a little improvement here and there, especially making sure the food is cooked properly.

In our BBQ chopped salad we had huge pieces of jicama that were the size of quarters.  I recently went to get takeout from the Mililani location and there was a new menu item. It was a white fish dish. This was over $25 and it was insanely small. I expect far more for something of this price and the quality was not great. In all honestly, I am doing the best I can to avoid going here.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=60

We are here on a Tuesday *humming ILOVEMAKONNEN* at about 6 turtles and they weren't slamming but still busy. We were seated promptly. At first he took us to the high stool, but the host quickly noticed my face (or body type) and asked if we wanted a booth which I happily accepted. The food came out real quick. My  soup bowl was big enough to fit my face in it....no I didn't try it....but I put my hand next to it for scale btw I have big hands. The pizza toppings were fresh and delicious, I could really taste every flavor along with sauce. The dough was tasty and not greasy.

Tonite we went just for a quick Wedding Anniversary in the middle of the week. Wait time was 40 minutes. We got seated and was wished a Happy Anniversary by the hostess. Our server (Ashlie/Ashley) was pleasant and friendly took our order. Asked us if we'd like some bread? We said ""yes"". She also informed us that kitchen is behind on orders so a little extra wait time on food. She came back with our drinks and my Dr Pepper was flat, no fizz, no taste, more like water. I asked her if I could get a Coke instead and explained why. She changed out my order (I felt like I bothered her by asking to switch soft drinks).  She came back after to check on us, but still no bread. We figured oh maybe because kitchen is behind...bread must be baking or something. I would think that maybe she would come and give us a heads up/reminder about the bread??? Different lady brought our food and I decided to ask her about the bread. She said she will check, but also because kitchen was behind. I noticed her talking to Ashlie by the door. After a couple minutes Ashlie came to tell us the bread just finished baking and she will bring it out as soon as it is cut. She brought our bread and we were good. When the bill came my wife noticed our son got charged $2.69 Kids Sundae when the kids menu clearly stated that a Kids's Sundae was $.99 w/ Kids Meal purchase (which we did) We pointed it out to her, she apologized and said that was her mistake and she would correct it...which she did. She was really trying and the restaurant was busy. I think Ashlie just had a lot of tables to wait on and seemed overwhelmed. She was doing her best, but it made me wonder...""What if this was a weekend night?"".

We were told to write our name down and left our phone number: they told us it would be a five to ten minute wait.  Well after two hours we knew we would not get in and that they probably forgot about us.  This left us very upset and we ended up going to genki ramen across from them.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=60

After 25 minutes went by which was already 11:45 I went back up and asked if we would be seated shortly the host replied ""  yes ma'am we just need to clean up your table "" okay sure now time is ticking and we don't get seated till about 12:05 I was upset ! For some reason I already knew it wasn't going to be a great experience after being sat we asked if our server could come to our table which she came about 10 minutes later she asked for our refreshments and said she would be back to take our order , it took her about 15 minutes to come back with 7 drinks ! Fine maybe that's a lot to do ! Then we placed our order and our food took 1 hr to come out ! We all pretty must lost our appetite ! In the mean time she only checked up on us 2x we had to ask for refills I mean come on she should've already had them coming out knowing we sat there for 1 hour ! By the time out food came some things were cold for example when order the spinach and artichoke dip and it came out still frozen the inside which I was so mad about knowing it took so long !

Jennifer M.,"Mililani Town, United States",176,32,,3.0,1/4/2017,"Three stars. But, they're still in their first week so I'll have to give them another try. I made an online order tonight and had been quoted a 20 minute wait time.  I had never used their online order form before, so I was surprised at how easy it was.  I arrived at 10 pm on Saturday night and had no problem snagging a parking spot right in the front of the restaurant.  The hostess at the front was extremely helpful.  I appreciate that she walked me to where the take out cashiers were located instead of pointing and saying ""take out orders can be picked up there"" then sending me on my way.  As we walked through the restaurant, every employee smiled and/or greeted me.  The two cashiers at the take out counter were also polite and helpful.  My only two issues were: 1.  I was quoted a 20 minutes wait time for my take out order.  However, I actually ended up waiting when I arrived and didn't get my order until 40 minutes after it was placed online.  I was on my way to work so this was more of an issue tonight than it normally would have been for me. 2.  I didn't receive any bread with my order.  I know I specifically requested it when I placed the order, so I'm not sure why it wasn't in my bag. Other than that, the food was great and the customer service was on point.  I can overlook the issues I encountered on this visit and say I'll definitely give them another chance.  They've been open for barely a week, so I'll cut them some slack :) * Side Note: There is a separate entrance for take out orders that is located on the side, closest to Times, facing the parking lot.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=60

So we ordered  our appetizer, one pizza, and a pasta. About 15 minutes after ordering, one of the managers (female) came out to our table to tell us they ran out of the sauce for that specific pasta. She offered to make us another type of pasta and she gave a recommendation of the pesto pasta with a certain type of noodle and etc. We ask how much that would cost and she said she will take care of it .... long story short... she delivered the pesto pasta to our table, she apologized for the wait, and DIDN'T CHARGE us for the pasta in the end! When we asked another manager (male) how we would reheat the California club pizza we ordered, he gave us great suggestion on how people order the topping on the side and etc. He was very kind and service here overall was amazing!

Each time the food was good and the staff friendly.  The staff always seem to be concerned that we were happy and apologized for things that weren't a big deal. For example, today the waitress said sorry that your pizza came a few minutes before your salad did.  What impressesed me about our waitress was that she gave my 3 year old daughter a small piece of pizza dough to play with. She was so happy!  And it kept her occupied for a long time. I wonder if this is a new thing or just her brilliant idea. I hope I can get pizza dough again the next time I go.   The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because their pizza dough rewards app is still not working.

That's it. I don't know how many comp'd meals we've received or a discount on the food, because it's been that many times.  The management staff, except for the restaurant manager (I can't remember his name), don't seem very customer service oriented. One even told me that maybe we shouldn't use their online ordering system. Really?  Another questioned my order, that was clearly printed on the food receipt. We've started to physically go through each and every dish we get before we leave, and surprise surprise...it is almost always wrong.  Tonight there was no mozzarella on one salad, the other salad did not have the beets or the dressing.   Again, we love CPK, and it's one of the few restaurants in Mililani that serves fairly healthy food.  I hope the Management does something about their quality control and customer service, as they are severely lacking.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=80

Derrick B.,"Aiea, United States",1,23,9,1.0,10/10/2017,"The food is good.  Service is awesome.  However we went to do a takeout because we were in a rush. Previously I would tip them even at the takeout counter because of the great service.  However this past time I went for a takeout there is no option to not tip.  It just says ""how much tip would you like to leave"".  Really? I'm doing a take out.  The cashier is doing nothing else special than to bring your order to you.  I don't mind tipping like I said but when they demand it then that is just not right.  I would avoid taking out here.  They make you feel obligated to tip since their iPad is right in front of us.  Just because of this we will not be eating here ever again. I'm not a CPK hater.  I love CPK. go to the pearl ridge one.  I give that location 5 stars.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=100
Elli K.,"Honolulu, United States",0,9,5,5.0,30/3/2017,"I have to say, for having been open for only 4 days, this location is fabulous. The people working here are so energetic and friendly...like they actually are happy to be working here. They all seem to be trained really well, in that they were constantly checking in on or helping customers (regardless if it was their table or not) and the system overall ran smoothly. We didn't have any wait to be seated (but we did get there before 5 pm), everyone seemed to know what they were doing, and service was quick and very responsive. My only recommendation is to the person doing salad: keep practicing....not quite enough dressing nor consistently cut pieces, but it was still good enough! :) I think this location will do well, though I think it may  not be big enough to meet the demands of the neighborhood.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=100

Sarah P.,"Wahiawa, United States",131,2,,4.0,18/9/2017,I was just recently diagnosed with Celiacs Disease and a nurse recommended this location to try because they are certified gluten free. Our waitress brought our menus and waters and shortly after the manager came over to talk with us since it was our first visit. He brought a small complimentary appetizer to us. He answered all my questions about the gluten free pizzas and cross contamination. I was surprised to hear everything they do in order to prevent cross contamination. This would be a 5 star review but they were really slow. The service and food was great just slow.

No sorry I was told I'm waiting on the salad, so the pizzas take 19 minutes and apparently a salad takes 40+ minutes. It was like this the last time I came and I thought maybe it was just that night, apparently not. Ridiculous. Update. So when the Pizzas can out they were cold so now they are remaking them.  Update.

Did a take our order.  I think it's like some kind of answering service... she couldn't even pronounce ""Mililani"".  I was quoted about 20 mins.. not bad!  Oh! And the menu is a tad different at this location than it is the others... either that or they got rid of the Asparagus & Spinach pasta. I arrive at CPK and went through the take out door.. there were 2 others waiting on their take out.  They seemed to have been waiting a while because they were offered a seat at the bar and bread to snack on and a drink while they waited... I went to the register and the gal asked for my name and got my order together.  She wasn't mean, but she rarely smiled either... kinda just went with the flow. She asked another girl to pack my food and mid way she got distracted with another conversation.  I just watched as my food was slowly being packed.  Manager approached me and asked if I been helped and I politely said ""yes, they're packing my food now"" and then there was some hustle.  Got my food, checked my order and went on my way. Food was great!  Thai Crunch Salad was delicious! First time trying that. All in all it was pretty good...

J J.,"Honolulu, United States",2,74,67,3.0,6/8/2017,Food is good.. service is a hit or miss. It really depends on what waiter you have and what hostess greets you.

Jeff G.,"Mililani, United States",17,2,,2.0,26/4/2017,"Went to this location per my wife's suggestion with my family of 4 on a Tuesday at 630. Was told there would be a 30 minute wait despite no other customers waiting and there being multiple 4 and 6 person tables open. Against my better judgment, I decided to wait the 30 minutes and get a text.  30 minutes go by and I still haven't got a text about a table opening up, so we go to ask the hostess what's going on. She seems suprised by our presence and says we will be the next available table... how convenient...  I look around and notice there are still plenty of tables open and not many customers waiting. On top of that, there seems to be a lack of wait staff for current customers. I trusted my gut this time, as I knew it would take forever to get waited on and have our food delivered, so I opted to cut our losses and go somewhere else.  I get that it's a Tuesday and they don't want a full wait staff, but would it really kill them to have an extra member or two working week nights so that the open tables can be sat? It seems silly to lose a family of 4+ because CPK has poor business planning and can't staff their restaurant to support the demand within the first month of opening!  A similar experience happened to me 10 years ago at a CPK in Boulder, CO, where we waited forever to be seated and it took over an hour to get our expensive, barely topped pizza. I vowed from that day to never eat at a CPK again, but here I am to show the wife what a joke this chain is. Their service is mind boggling slow. I have no clue why people enjoy this chain.  While on my soap box, the menu outside is completely devoid of pricing. Does CPK think it is a Michelin restaurant? Is their food so expensive that if I have to ask the prices, then I can't afford it? Really pointless to have a menu without prices. Good way at luring people in and sticking them with expensive food when they realize they waited forever and don't want to lose all that time waiting (sunken cost fallacy).  I will continue to avoid this chain as overpriced food with terrible service is not my cup of tea. Only giving 2 stars as we weren't able to eat the food to give it a fair assessment.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=100

Ashlee O.,"Mililani, United States",240,18,29,4.0,25/7/2017,"So we did take out this time, 07/23/17 called in the order, and I must say the woman who answered the phone was super polite and asked about extra sauces with out me having to ask!  I was pleased at her demeanor and attitude towards taking my phone order.  I parked in the convenient to go stalls out side their establishment, my order was ready. The manager Tracie did come out to authorize the comps, which I really did appreciate. We went home....I really hoped it was perfect....and it was. Chives on the pasta, extra sauces for salads, all add ins accounted for. Even the butter cake and vanilla ice cream.  I really enjoyed this meal, and will be back but will probably stick to take out for a while. Had a really easy time getting food, food was correct and tasty!  Thank you again to Tracie and her team for the take out side that night!  JUNE 2017 This is my second time at this location and probably the worst of my entire life. I love the Pearlridge and alamoana location, so I was super excited to have a location closer to home.  Unfortunately both times eating in, AND the one time we ordered take out was so underwhelming.  For THIS EXPERIENCE in particular, we knew we would probably have to wait, even though there were like 1/2 the tables open. (Must be they can't find employees to work there)  We did get greeted within 30 seconds upon walking up to the podium, and told the wait time. So we waited only about 10 minutes which was surprising! So far so good right? So we got seated, our server took about 5-7 minutes to even come over to us. ALIKA? ALEKA? Something along those lines. That was HER name.  At first impression seemed like everything would be great, took our drink order, and left. The first drinks came in a pretty timely manner, then we ordered an appetizer, the avocado chicken spring roll or something. And LET ME TELL YOU HOW FLIPPING FAST THAT SHIT CAME OUT I kid you not, it came in about 3-5 minutes....which would be great, if they actually made it for us! It was COLD!!!!!! We did eat it any way and didn't complain at the restaurant because we were all starving already haha.  So we were like ""whatever"", and ate it. So we order,  Then I have no idea what her problem was, but ALIKA ALEKA what have you her name be idk, but she literally walked past our table for 15-20 minutes without checking once, for drink refills or ANYTHING. So now I'm upset because I am in the customer service industry, and have very high standards for establishments I frequent. Food was OK, but honestly ALIKA ALEKA (an African American women with glasses) was the worst waitress I've encountered in a very long time. So airheady slow moving and seemed just lost. She was folding napkins for us instead of refilling waters, running back and forth doing who knows what when other tables were looking around for her because she was NO WHERE TO BE FOUND.  I did manage to flag her down once for a drink refill before dinner got there. But by that time this chick just rubbed is all the wrong way. Either she needs better training, personal motivation to succeed at her career/job whatever CPK is for her. Because I've never had such bad service at any CPK. It's sad. Idk if she had too many tables to watch, or what. I'm just stating our experience and how it left us feeling that night, spending our hard earned money AND tipping some one who honestly didn't deserve even a 5% tip. I had so ask another waitress for water, because ALIKA ALEKA was again no where to be found. So now as another waitress comes to fill my water, ALIKA, decides to make an appearance to finally deliver my bf's beer, and as I'm telling the OTHER waitress thank you for my water, ALIKA goes in and says YOURE WELCOME with a smile like she is doing such an awesome job....like no.  I was saying thank you to the girl that was REFILLING MY WATER. So I did make it a point to thank her after my meal when we were leaving, since ALIKA took that thank you from her. All in all, I will probably eat here again, but if we get alika I'm walking out.  Just not worth the stress and annoyance to have a meal with her as our waitress again.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=100

And it came out less then 10min after ordering and it was hot, yummy and the wonton roll was crispy and fried to perfection. Its favorite thing to get here and i'd have to say that this one was the best one I had everrr!!  My hubby ordered the lemongrass chicken and it was delicious!!

She was on it. Drinks filled, food came out fast and everything was tasting very delicious. We didnt have to wait so long for anything.

Ok can i get a last and a phone number? Sure.  Outside or insideor first available? First available. The wait was sooner only about 20 minutes! Perfect.  Walked in and the hostess sat us on an outside table.  I think if it was in the day i would not want outside.  The mall was pretty crowded and there was live music in the center too. The server was excellent! She was very attentive and always coming back to check on our table.  The food was great as usual. What i thought was the icing to the cake was that the manager or head kitchen guy made his way to all the tables to ask how was the food.  I personally thought that was personable.

Gabriel P.,"Honolulu, United States",8,83,131,3.0,11/5/2017,Was in the area so we decided to try the new location at the Town Center at Mililani. Got there when the doors opened 11 o'clock. We were the fith in line. Took about 8 minutes then it was our turn. The person didn't say hi or acknowledged us. So I said table for two. He looked at the computer after a couple of minutes he ask us to step in. There was 3 workers standing after another minute one of them looked at us and ask us if we're the party of six. Said no then he looked at the computer and asked if we were the party of two. Said yes. And he picked up the utensils and menus. He than started looking around after another minute or two. A girl came. He gave her the utensils and menus. She then asked me if I wanted to sit in the restaurant or in the lanai. We said inside. She asked us if raised table would be okay. Said yes cause it was getting hot outside. The inside of the restaurant is set up like bar. The seating is high bar stools and a high padded bench. ( I wouldn't recommend this seating option if have trouble stepping up). Our server was cordial and took our order of spinach dip and side order of flat bread and a small salad. Our drinks came out and a couple of minutes later the spinach dip was served. Another five minutes later our salad came. Started to eat our salad and dip. After a few minutes we started to look for our server. The pita bread was to be eaten with the dip. Our server finally came our salad and dip was almost done. I asked her to cancel my order of pita bread. She was very apologetic and said she would go and get it. Told her we were done and to pack our dip to go. A few minutes later a manager came with a new spinach dip with our pita bread. Told him that we asked our server to pack our dip and left over chips to go. He apologized and left. Our server came back with our take out bag and the check. We weren't charged for the spinach. Which was nice.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=120

She was irritated with everything that I asked for. After sitting down, she looked at me, shook her head, then asked me what I wanted. No ""hello"" just ""what can i get for you?""  My drink was horrible, but food was great(as usual). I also noticed how she treated the waitresses. She was very cruel. I could tell the servers were busy, so when their drinks were ready, she got fustrated and yelled at the waitress for not picking up the drinks. Even if she was upset, the bartender should not display that agression to others in front of her customers. I felt like leaving immediately. I dont understand why she wants to work at cpk when she treats customers and employees like so. She is totally not indicative of a cpk employee!

Marilyn K.,"Haleiwa, United States",70,13,9,2.0,17/4/2017,"Our server ""Spike"" almost ruined my first time at CPK Mililani. We sat down out side around 530. It was busy and I noticed a large party of women next to us celebrating something. Before Spike even approached our table I noticed him helping the large party out. He seemed flustered. Right away he left a bad taste in my mouth. No proper introduction. Jumped right into drinks and orders. He also immediately pointed out that he will also be helping out that large party of women as well. It was almost a warning. Like, he's gonna be busy.  We wanted to take our time and relax. He took a big pad of paper out. Set it down in top of our table and began to recite and write down everything we ordered. A little awkward for him have his note pad on our table. We ordered fried Mac and cheese. They brought out a regular bowl of Mac and cheese to us twice before we got the fried Mac that we ordered. It was dry and not very good at all. My club style pizza (which I've had a few times at other locations) was dry and kind of burnt. But we still ate it. Spike didn't check to see how the apps were so we just said whatever and ate it. He seemed to be worried about the large party next to us a little more. I asked a glass of the Meiomi pino noir. He says ""which one is that?"". Hmmm shouldn't you at least know your wines by the glass? After I ordered it he kept walking by and saying out loud ""glass of wine"" as if he was reciting out loud as a reminder to himself to bring over my wine or ring it in? Again, It was so awkward.  I asked for share plates. He grabbed a solo plate from the server stand behind me and said ""I gotta go look for another one"". As far as I know the plate sitting on the server stand behind me could've been from anything. It was a little dirty when he set it down. But he walked away so fast trying ""to find another"" that I didn't have a chance to tell him.  Lastly, I asked for a box. He brought one over and proceeded to box up my food at the table. I stopped him and said I would do it. You either box it in the back or let the customer box it themselves. We don't want to see your hands all over our food right in front of us. It was so weird. He was a very intense server and my time was not relaxing what so ever mostly because we had to deal with him. You could tell he was trying to get everything done right but he was so unprofessional. He needs to trained. Two stars based solely on the service. Food is usually great at CPK.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=120
Kim N.,"Mililani, United States",0,56,27,2.0,18/5/2017,"We went on a Tuesday night at 7pm and not that busy so why it took 50 mins to get seated was ridiculous. Especially since we were quoted 10-20 mins, then got the text saying approximately 30 mins. I HIGHLY suggest going back after your quoted time and asking where u are on the list if u haven't been called. Thinking that they had their stuff together, I went to check how much longer it would be being that 45 mins had passed and still nothing. Clearly when I asked how much longer, both hostesses that checked had that look of ""oh $H@!"" On their face and I was seated next. As we were being seated they tried to give me the ""we tried to notify you"". No. Just no. It doesn't make sense that I was able to get their initial text giving me my estimated wait time and nothing after that. I wish she had just saved it. So I started dinner irritated and with a hungry toddler. Yay. We order and the server was nice and we got drinks right away but we didn't even get bread til well over 20 mins after being seated. We actually got bread AFTER our food arrived. I didn't get a refill on my passion mango iced tea until right before we left but my one glass was really good! The food was pretty good. My chicken tequila fettuccine was at least.  I know this place isn't geared towards kids and you can tell. Note for parents considering: the only carb option they have on the kid menu is pasta. No rice. No mashed potatoes. Their grilled chicken was pretty dry as well. If your kid loves pasta then it could be a win for u though I tried my kid's alfredo and it was pretty blah. Our server did help box our leftovers which was nice.  I was super disappointed in the experience. Probably because of the reception but it just kept rolling downhill. I didn't even tip 15% and normally ALWAYS do regardless of how crappy service was cuz I know it supplements their low wages but I was just so irked with the overall service. It could be worth going for a quick lunch with no kids. I will not go there for dinner again. Ever. Period.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=120

We received a text within the 30 minute wait, and we sat down.  We were greeted by Zevan and he got our drink orders.  During this time (around 7:30 PM), the restaurant was very busy.  Zevan ended up being our waiter as well.  What I really appreciated about Zevan was that he came to check up on us throughout the night and our orders were perfect.  Watching him you can see that he had a lot of tables, and he was really bustin' his butt to make sure that everyone was taken care of.  Taking into account how busy the restaurant was, I feel that Zevan really took good care of us.  Of course his team also helped him out by delivering some of our food.  This is my third time dining at this location and this was my best experience.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=120
Briana Y.,"Colorado Springs, United States",5,142,67,3.0,20/5/2017,"I love California Pizza Kitchen's diverse menu. I've been to this particular location twice. The first time was on a very busy Friday night where we waited over an hour for a table. The second time was for lunch on a Saturday. On the busy Friday night, we watched an entire section of the outdoor patio area clear out and get re-sat at a glacial pace. I've worked in the restaurant industry before and I understand that you should wait until a server has served drinks to a table before seating another table in their section, but we saw a table finish appetizers before the next table was sat in the server's section. It took so long to seat the section I literally thought the server was cut for the night at one point. We were told the wait ahead of time, but upon viewing the seating practices, I think it was a false wait. When we went on another day for lunch, we ordered an appetizer and entrees. Our entrees came out before our appetizer, but the manager did deliver the appetizer and apologize. I had heard bad things about the service before visiting this location, but I assumed it was because they had just opened and they were still working the kinks out.

The outdoor seating is awesome on a cool evening or even a warm one with a small breeze. Food is typical CPK good stuff. Newer menu items and ""specials"" or ""seasonal"" dishes always deserve a go.

Yoonie L.,"Honolulu, United States",152,18,138,4.0,24/5/2017,"A group of my friends and I decided to eat at CPK at  the Mililani location before catching a movie for convenience since it's next to the movie theatre. I personally wanted to check it out too since it just opened there. We were greeted by friendly staff. It was a Tues night and we had no reservations and were seated immediately. Loved the Hawaiian decor inside with painted surfboards and LOVED the canvases of pictures on the walls. The place was quite large and had a great  outside terrace. Our waitress, Cami was really friendly and sweet. I had the Wild Mushroom Pizza and it was super tasty. The crust was nice and chewy with the right amount of crispy. Everything was fine until 2 of my friends decided to order the Salted Caramel Pudding to go since we needed to leave to catch the movie. When they each got their individual brown paper bags, when they pulled it out, one was full and the other was half the size. I called Cami over and she was very apologetic and ordered my short changed friend a new one and sent the Manager over to our table. He was very nice and also very apologetic and gave all 5 of us a free dessert voucher for the next visit! Hey, stuff happens but if they make it right, that's what counts!

We got seated right away, BUT we sat and for 20-25 minutes, no one came to greet us or take our drink order!!!! This is when I decided that I wasn't waiting any longer! As we waited though, I noticed another table was still waiting to be greeted as well....and another table complaining that her kids didn't receive their desserts yet! Wth?! I told my hubby and son that we're leaving, but before we do...I'm making a complaint! Found the manager and asked if they were short staffed because no one came to our table after waiting for so long!!! She asked where we were sitting...told her where but at this point I'm so irritated that I told her we are leaving and that they should read their Yelp reviews because I'm not the only one who thinks their service sucks!!! Never again! How long have they been open? Luckily there's many other restaurants around here!!! Thank you CPK Mililani for ruining our Anniversary!

Travis S.,"Kapolei, United States",13,2,,3.0,4/8/2017,"I can't believe I'm actually writing this, I've been in the industry for a long time and I know how servers think, but as a bartender you have to set an example for the service that the establishment has. So I recognize bad, good, and great service when I see it.  Yesterday afternoon I came in and with my two nieces to have a nice lunch, we were greeted by our hostess who was very welcoming and right off the back offered if we wanted to dine in or outside, we chose to sit inside. We get to our table and the hostess explained to me about the DOUGH membership, she was a little inaccurate about what she said but she hit the main points lol. A few minutes later our waitress Cheyenne(I had to ask her her name she didn't give us a spiel) she started us off with drinks and didn't explain the menu or the kids menu. But being industry I knew what I was doing. For some reason I could tell she was judging me by my appearance or maybe my age , some ignorant service workers do that, but I believe in serving people as if I were serving myself. She then comes back and mumbles something about appetizers and before I could even order an appetizer she walks away. Comes back a few minutes later and asks if we're ready, so by this time I just need to get my nieces fed. I ordered a cheese pizza and a Thai salad (so yummy) I'm never disappointed with the food when I dine at cpk and for the most part I get amazing service. But to feel judged in a place I come to all the time and being in the industry isn't acceptable to me. I am a very generous tipper but I definitely consider the service that I get. Back to my experience, food comes out I order a glass of wine took about 15 minutes to get there by then my craft is warm, doesn't check on us the whole entire meal , nor does she refill my water or nieces fruit punches, but in watching her service all her other tables and treating hen like royalty lol. I also ordered a ""potato wedge"" for my girls to share but they were just roasted potatoes so I'm guessing she didn't know the difference, I wanted to immediately send them back because they had no flavor so we weren't gonna eat it; normally I don't send things back I'll just pay it because I know that's annoying on the servers end, but at this point I could care less. So finally when we're ready to box up she comes and asks for a box(rushing us) and told her we didn't like the wedges, she smiled and took them to her manager 10 ft away from us and snobbishly said ""they didn't like them"". Our bill was $42 had my service been on point I would love left a generous amount but she got 20% and that's me being nice!  Moral of this experience, don't judge your customers! We all come out to eat for a reason to eat good food, and have good service!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=140
Noways T.,"Mililani, United States",1,4,,1.0,9/7/2017,"Went to the Mililani one maybe 10 times so far, and service is getting crapper by the week. I don't think the care. If you really need Cpk, go somewhere else.  Last night we waited about 20 minutes to get in and the place was half empty. Seems like we arrived before the evening staff or they were understaffed. The person who seated us didn't smile, say hi, or anything but give us a sitting bitch face. She just walked us to a table. The next person who came by introduced herself, told us she wasn't our server, took our drink orders (beer and soft drink), then walked away. She returned with a drink for my young son and no straw. I didn't realize it so had to flag someone else down for a straw. 15 minutes later a girl stopped and asked if we had any questions. Who was this person? I guess she was our real server buy she never introduced herself or anything. 10 minutes later she stopped by again and I asked ""where's my beer?"" I finally got it after being there for 25 minutes. The place was still pretty empty.  We put in our food order and it came in reasonable time. I noticed that our particular server seemed really stressed. She had a few high maintenance tables. You know the type of people who think they're the most important people in the place and they own the wait staff? Yea, those types of idiots. Anyway, here's the worst part. There was a manager on duty, who just waltzed around with no concern or worried look on her face that some of her staff was dying. She actually walked past us about 10 times and I made eye contact with her on many occasions. I was going to ask for straw, napkins, another drink, etc. because the rest of the staff was sure to walk by as quickly as possible and avoid eye contact. Nah, this manager doesn't appear to care.  Save yourself from having to wait long for a forgettable experience. The other Cpk's are far superior to Mililani. This place can't use ""we're new"" as an excuse at this point.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=140
Halia H.,"Wahiawā, United States",63,8,,1.0,24/9/2017,"I've gone to this place countless times, but the time I went last time was by far one of the worst dining experiences I've had.  The night seemed to go off well, other than the fact we had to wait 50 minutes for our seats at 8 pm at night. When we got seated, we got greeted by our nice waitress. She was sweet and gave us our drinks after we ordered our food right away after waiting the 50 minutes. It ended up taking about 30 minutes just for the food to come out. Not only that, but our bread and spinach artichoke dip appetizer took forever because they had to make more bread. So, after waiting 30 minutes for my mother, my friend, and I's three orders of Shrimp Scampi, Chicken Tequila Pasta, and Mac and Cheese pasta withe extra sauce, we were not satisfied at all. We were already irritated at the fact we had to wait 30 minutes just for our food and constantly getting apologies from our waitress about first the 20 minute wait for our appetizer, and then another 30 minute wait for our food. It was also my mom's birthday dinner, so we weren't so pleased. On top of that, the food was not delish at all... my mom ordered a shrimp scampi (which we get is supposed to be super healthy with all the zucchini and such), but my mom said it was way too sour. She made my friend and I try it ourselves... and both my friend and I did not taste the ""butter"" or ""shrimp"" at all. All we tasted was lemon. It was not enjoyable for my mom. Now, on to my mac and cheese.... I usually order this, and I honestly love it. But, this time, it tasted different. I had ordered extra sauce, and usually the extra sauce comes in a bowl on the side, but this time it did not. It was strange at first. And, even after a minute I got my mac and cheese, another waiter came to deliver the extra sauce in the tiny bowl, only to see that my plate was already drowned in the cheese sauce. The cheese sauce didn't taste like cheese at all. It tasted like milk. It didn't taste like the mac and cheese I always order from CPK. Maybe there was a different cook or something, but the service my mom, my friend, and I got last night was not impressive.  Aside from that, as I mentioned before, it was my mom's birthday... a nice employee who was off shift and sitting on the table behind us ended up buying us a brownie with ice cream. We didn't know he bought it for us, but we at least expected a free ice cream that they usually serve on birthdays (I've even had my birthdays at CPK before)... but we didn't... I had to remind the waitress once more it was my mom's birthday, in which she said ""They didn't give you the brownie and ice cream that the employee behind you bought for you guys?"". We had no clue the nice waiter who was off duty had bought it for us. We could have walked out without it or without any ice cream dessert for my mother's birthday at all.  Thankfully, the manager ended up coming to our table to ask what was wrong, in which we told him... and he ended up paying for the shrimp scampi and remaking our 2 dishes for us. But, honestly, I am very disappointed in CPK Mililani... I was expecting way better like the times I've gone before. CPK is one of my favorite restaurants, but this experience was just horrible. We ended up being late to our 9:50 PM movie because we had to wait for the check and remakes. We got seated at 8:30, and were expecting to have a good birthday dinner and then a quick dessert but it turned out not so good... The waitress was nice and we appreciate the effort of remaking our orders even if the pasta for the shrimp scampi remake with no zucchini was undercooked. We will definitely be coming back in the future, but we just hope that they will improve their service.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=140

Ordered pick up order for a family of 4, arrived to a packed restaurant, take out line had 2 in front of us; it got worse from there - took 15 minutes each person to pick up their orders so you can imagine standing in line for 30 minutes waiting for a take out order!! Then the '3' service staff continued to go through our bags, check the ticket, go to the freezer, come back, go to the kitchen, come back and finally said our order was ready to go. Drove home only ONLY TO FIND OUT order was totally messed up, no tortilla soup, no pizza toppings, no dipping sauce for egg rolls, no ice cream 2 times for desserts, a total of over $25 was missing!!! SO WE DROVE BACK, only to find still packed restaurant and this time 7 people in line waiting for their orders. Not going to spend over 2 hours waiting for their inexperienced staff to go through our receipts, go through the bags and look at each other blankly on what to do. WE GAVE UP.  Suggestion to not have the beverage area so close to the take out line; service staff were going back and forth constantly doing the water/tea what ever and it was crowded. It was pretty bad; does this mean take out orders need to be unpacked and looked at each item before you leave this restaurant?

Short staffed maybe? No..they took names and numbers and were gonna text people back to come back...(there not people sitting waiting for just name to be called like most restaurants)....so you take reservations.....she stated no...yes that is a form of reservations....so we left...went and grabbed some food somewhere else..to go....as we walked back to our car approx 15 mins later...there were even more tables open....waiting for people to return....Bad service and Poor business decision as you turned multiple people away that were willing sit eat and pay ...or should you run it like most business those tables would be full continuously...Should I want CPK again I will go to another location.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=160
Ralph Y.,"Mililani, United States",0,69,16,3.0,5/4/2017,"Went for lunch and dinner.  Food is good but not great although it does give Mililani another option and that's always good.  Lunch was the Quinoa and Arugula Salad plus the Cedar Plank Halibut.  Both were good with beer and wine. Back for dinner, we had 5 of us so we were able to order more and sample things.  We had the Charred Shishito Peppers (nice sauce and just a hint of spiciness), Asparagus + Arugula Salad and Avocado Club Egg Rolls.  Those were all good.  Ordered the Farmers Market & Dakota Smashed Pea & Barley soup.  The Farmers was very good but a few sips of the Smashed Pea and I had to send back.  Definitely would not order that again.  There was the Garlic cream Fettucine with shrimp, Margherita pizza, cedar plank salmon.  We did have a round of desserts.  The only thing that was missed was a drink order at the end.  The wait staff had apparently forgotten and I reminded him about it and it still never came.  Tip was reduced for screwing up badly.  I don't mind mistakes but when you're reminded and you still forget...  Too bad because the service was very good up to that point.  I also pointed that out on their survey but have yet to be called.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=160

We got seated and was greeted right away from our waitress Alika who was amazing. Despite being super busy, she was very friendly and polite. In fact, all of the staff I encountered tonight was. Our food came out rather quickly and was delicious. The carne asada pizza was life changing! It was so good, I don't have any pictures of it because it left the plate so quickly.

I was ok with that, Mililani Town Ctr was very crowded. We got seated, ordered pupus, it came out fast. We ordered the flat bread which was only 4 pieces for $8+. I ordered the shrimp scampi linguine while my hubby ordered the penne pasta. When I received my linguine dish, my first impression was ""holy shit, wheres the rest of it?"" Presentation was spot on, texture was great. I poked my fork in it, I couldnt believe how much linguine they DIDNT give. I swear I only had 3/4 cup of noodles. And for linguine being a little fat size, it was very little. Dont get me wrong peeps, the pasta had lot of flavor but $16+ it wasnt worth it. I can go to Ricados or Bravos to get a mich bigger size meal at that price. The penne pasta was a bit bland but was served a good portion. Our waiter & waitress, yes there were a couple that waited on us, was pleasant. Service was fast once we sat down. 3 stars was mainly for the food.

Warm wine arrived another 10 minutes later and bread maybe another five after that.    Another 15 and our drinks are gone, the bread is gone, our plates are pushed to the edge of the table able and nobody seems to care. Meanwhile Laurie is at a table of old men paying their tab chatting up for 10 minutes. Almost an hour in and nothing. We get up and tell Laurie we are leaving. All of a sudden the manager shows up and says the kitchen lost our ticket. Seriously?  We've been sitting for over 15 minutes trying to catch the attention of anyone that would look our way. Poor poor poor customer service. I hope corporate gets the idea. This obviously is a systemic problem. We will NEVER go back to this location and quite possibly to any of their locations.
