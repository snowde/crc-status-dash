Then I ordered a refill on a Coke and it got delivered to me over 10 minutes later by another server ""female"" then when we told her for a refill for an ice-tea she forgot and so we told our original server and that too took over 10 minutes.

Evelyn T.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",1116,915,518,4.0,1/26/2015,"Exceptional service was experienced here yesterday. The staff wanted to make us happy and felt good about serving us. We had a gift card that my parents-in-law had given us and were using it a second time. $50 goes a long way at a CPK. We placed our orders: 1) A carnitas pizza with habanero sauce on the side 2) A Hawaiian BBQ Chicken pizza. We opted for the traditional crust on both pizza, as neither of us has celiac disease. California Pizza Kitchen's menu had gluten-free options for their crusts for those who have celiac. We ordered these drinks: 1) Ginger Ale 2) Lemonade. The drinks were refilled for free, as per CPK's policy. I also asked for a glass of ice water, which was also refilled upon request. We enjoyed sharing our pizzas. The carnitas pizza is really good - they placed a lot of tender carnitas on the pizza. The habanero sauce went well with the pizza and really spiced it up and added flavor.  The Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Pizza was similar to the regular BBQ Chicken Pizza. The only difference was that it included pineapple, which made for a sweeter, tangier taste. As usual, there were leftovers. A staff member boxed up our pizzas, which had instructions for re-heating printed out on the top of the box. The leftovers tasted great the next day. We were pleased with our visit and found it a great value.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=20

Chad C.,"Mission Viejo, CA",132,16,6,4.0,5/15/2014,"Very sweet and good looking host and server. I grew up with this cpk, and the reason I give 4 stars rather than 5 is because of the changes that they have made. It appears like you guys are downgrading.

Some of the pizzas are good, I once decided on the salmon entree instead. This was clearly a mistake, the fish seemed flavourless, and I would be happy with the meal, only if there were no other choices around.

Sami B.,"Wilsonville, OR",9,97,4,1.0,11/5/2013,"I called in, placed an order on Tuesday night. Asked for BBQ Chicken pizza, Focaccia Chicken Caesar sandwich (which they don't carry anymore, it is on ciabatta now apparently) and 2 side caesar salads. Came inside to pick up and waited behind another takeout customer for about 10-15 minutes even though it wasn't busy- the 3 people working the takeout station were laughing and talking to each other (there was a 2nd open register...), completely ignoring me. When I finally reached the desk, the girl (I don't remember her name, but she had braces) reviewed my order in which she said I ordered a side caesar and a side house salad with caesar. I told her I ordered TWO caesars and she tried to convince me that a house salad is ""practically the same"" as a caesar salad ""except with carrots and stuff"" - sorry, not in my opinion. I asked for TWO, not ONE. Took awhile for her to come back with the order - she placed the sandwich and salads in the bag; I asked for bread and butter AND a side of caesar dressing twice (once on the phone and in person). She pulled out the pizza from under her desk which was odd. Once I got home, the pizza looked OLD, it was cold and tasted like cardboard. BOTH salads were composed of a couple of pieces of lettuce (wilted) that barely covered the bottom of the container, no parmesan, and less than half of a container of dressing for each salads (not to mention, no extra side as I had asked). The ciabatta on the sandwich was broken and crushed, making the whole thing fall apart. Oh, and we only got bread, no butter (as I had asked for twice!) Overall, I feel like the past couple times I have come to CPK (either eating in or taking out), I am paying for a low quality, small portioned, skimped version of a meal for raised prices. I can't believe I paid nearly $40 for this!! And what is with the menu changes? They are worse, not better. Example: focaccia was great! Ciabatta is a poor trade. I definitely don't plan on returning to any of their restaurants which is a shame - my family and I had been coming here for years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=100
Joel J.,"Mission Viejo, CA",17,163,151,2.0,4/16/2012,"Ok.  Obivously CPK is corporate and over-rated, but it does have some 4 star food on the menu!   ***The 2 stars I am giving it is NOT because of the food or the service.  As mentioned earlier the food is 4 and the service is actually a 4-5*** So why the 2 starts?  Because when I dine in I expect the overall odor of a restaurant to be a the very least neutral and to max out at smelling the delight aromas of the exotic cuisines coming from the kitchen.  To be 100% honest: The place smells bad.  Like an interesting combination of butter, stale dorritos, and smelly feet.  --But all joking aside, it does smell pretty bad in the interior and I've eaten at that place now 2 times.   So you could imagine my amazement when I noticed that all of the people enjoyed the experience of eating in the restaurant!   However, this time grace seemed to give me more wisdom and the confidence to match, than my last experience there and so I  spoke up and requested a seat outside.  Out there I was able to enjoy the food and company I was with.  I'm a veggie fucaccia sandwich addict!  That's always been my favorite item on the menu!

We decided to get dinner a few nights ago (thursday i believe.) As to be expected, there was a wait. The staff was friendly and even the manager was helping assist people to their tables. We got sat in no time. Or server (Casandra) was extremely attentive and upbeat, despite the crowed restaurant. She made us feel very welcome, which differed from past experiences. Our drinks (white sangria I high recommend) took a bit longer than desired. But it was so tasty that it made up for the wait. This is was only negative thing we had to say. Food wise, anything with BBQ sauce is amazing! A friendly younger manager even stopped by to make sure we were happy.

Stephanie T.,"Mission Viejo, CA",93,69,20,2.0,5/10/2011,"You can't really go wrong with food at CPK. Everyone knows what they have, as CPK is a national chain with virtually the same food at almost every location.  This review is based on service and environment alone at the CPK in Mission Viejo on Marguerite.  Vince and I frequently use the call in feature and pick up our favorite food. We are here so often, that the pick up people totally recognize us and are super friendly and fantastic. I feel like writing a seperate review just for them, because it would be at least four stars.  However, we rarely eat in-restaurant. That being said, it was a treat to actually go in and decide to sit down for a nice lunch. There wasn't a wait, so that part was easy. But we quickly realized our waiter, while friendly, was really not all that interested in actually providing quality service. He quickly sat us. And left. Came back asked for drink orders quickly - fine. Spent at least 5 minutes flirting with two girls sitting behind us. Don't know if these two were friends of his, or if he was trying to score a date, but I definitely noticed the disparity of attention paid to us since he wouldnt be getting any action from either of us.  Food took a long time, so I asked for bread. He said no problem. Bread never came. More flirting with girls behind us. Food comes, its great of course, but all of a sudden he pays attention to us, asking me questions when my mouth is obviously full of food. Lovely. Food done, waiter no where to be found. Then more flirting with girls behind us. Laughing, flirting, giggling = no diet coke refill for me.  Wait for check, wait for check, wait for check. Check finally comes. No diet coke re-fills. Flirting, laughing, jokes with girls behind us. Wait for him to pick up check, wait for him to pick up check, wait for him to pick up check. More flirting. Cue angry scorpion woman looks from me.  Waiter notices scorpion woman looks, finally completes our check AFTER girls behind us finally leave.

Al S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1252,506,242,4.0,12/21/2013,"Newsflash....... well, maybe a ""Semi-Old-flash"" from mid 2011, but it explains ""a lot!"" LOS ANGELES -- Private equity firm Golden Gate Capital is buying California Pizza Kitchen Inc. for about $470 million, three months after the restaurant chain put itself up for sale. (skip to this...) Golden Gate's other restaurant buyouts include the purchase of On the Border last year. And last month Lawson Software Inc. agreed to a $2 billion acquisition offer from Golden Gate and Infor. That explains a lot for me. One of my thoughts, and my opinion about CPK, and On the Border, was that they were ""hitting the downward part of their cycle"" as a restaurant chain. We just revisited CKP, MV yesterday, early evening. While the physical layout hasn't changed, they have made ""food changes."" First thing we noticed was a new, tall, thin menu. It's been edited down, but looks like a winner. Their classic fare is still there, (ie; BBQ Chicken Salad). But they do have some new items. (see their website for a menu-listing with nice photos). For a light 6pm dinner we two ordered their ""Two Classic Soups in One Bowl""..... Tortilla and Lentil-Pea. The bowl was large, and the soups were very good. They start you off with a complimentary ""cut sections of warm french baugette"", and a well seasoned olive oil. In the past, bread was served cold. Now, the oil is a great option over butter. My wife had the new Chimmichurri Chicken, grilled chicken breast with a chimmichurri-style sauce, and grilled veggies. My wife felt the vegetables lacked seasoning. I agreed. The chicken was OK, but the overall serving was small, yet the price was $16... which we didn't realize until I paid the bill. That was the only issue we had last night. I ordered my BBQ Chicken Salad, and it was as good as it has always been. ($14). Between the soup, the chicken entree and my salad, we left satisfied. I shared my salad, and my wife gave me some of her chicken and the chimmichurri sauce.  If my wife's entree had not been so overpriced, I might have gone with 4-stars. As our server was attentive. But we'll certainly do future visits, and I'll try a couple of their other new or improved menu items. I know it's a chain...... but this is more an FYI than a ""you gotta' go"" recommendation. I'd say ck' 'em out. I think they're better... maybe not ""better than ever""...... but possibly more pleasing to the palate. (?) BTW....... sent a feedback message via the CPK website with our opinion of their ""chimmichurri chicken entree."" Curious to see if they respond. (?) VERY NICE RESPONSE FROM CPK just one day after using their ""online feedback."" The GM of the CPK MV location actually called me early today while driving to visit family in W.L.A. She noted my comments, and said that the feedback was helpful, as she's going to speak with the supervising chef for their restaurant. This is one of the few times that a retailer's ""online feedback feature"" actually resulted in a callback. Again, I was very, very impressed. I believe she's also sending some gift cert's our way, which wasn't asked for or expected. That alone deserves one more star........ yes it does.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=80

Sukhraj B.,"Orange, CA",1725,1189,1870,4.0,11/15/2009,"We dilly-dallied for a few days deciding where we would eat on Sunday for a late lunch/dinner. I remembered spotting a CPK down the street and that sealed the deal. I like the location over others I've visited.  The big windows let in a lot of light and we got a prime spot overlooking the street since there really isn't much of a view of anything else around here.  Our host seemed bothered by our presence.  When we first showed up, he was busy organizing the menus and barely heard us when we said ""party of 2.""  Would it kill you to greet us and smile?  I guess so. As soon as we were seated, our waitress appeared out of thin air.  I already knew what I wanted to drink.  The same as usual - the peach iced tea.  They infuse it with an artificially flavored peach shot and throw in a peach except peaches are out of season and it wasn't as good as I remembered it to be.   We scanned the menu for our pizza choices.  They've added a few since I last visited over a year ago but I settled for the tried and true - the Greek with avocados and he got the Jamaican Jerk.  I was cold so I also ordered a cup of Sedona Tortilla Soup.  This soup is pretty good but doesn't quite compare to the tortilla soup at Islands; I have yet to find something that beats that. We can't really complain about the pizzas.  They're baked in the oven with real logs and arrive piping hot.  We watched a few being made as we waited. The Greek comes with Mediterranean spiced grilled chicken and Mozzarella cheese topped with a chilled Greek salad of cucumbers, red onions, fresh tomatoes, Greek olives, Feta cheese and a lemon-herb vinaigrette and served with homemade Tzatziki sauce and chopped Italian parsley.  And the Jamaican Jerk comes with grilled Jamaican Jerk spiced chicken breast with spicy sweet Caribbean sauce, Mozzarella cheese, applewood smoked bacon, mild onions, roasted red and yellow peppers and green onions.   Yum!   The pizzas were flavorful and delicious.  We got them on the honey wheat bread which is pretty filling so we got half way through and boxed up the rest for later because we wanted to save room for dessert.  During this season, CPK serves up pumpkin cheesecake and it's only available until Christmas.  It's not to be missed.  We shared a slice and that's one thing that hasn't changed over the years and as always I was tempted to buy a whole pie but restrained myself.  On the way out, our host was polite and opened the door for us.  We're not sure what lifted his spirits but we were nonetheless content with full bellies and plenty of leftovers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=80

So I agreed to take her out to eat this past weekend here because she's been fiending for it. First stop: CPK @ the Irvine Spectrum. On a Saturday night. Big mistake. The place was a zoo - quite literally. The wait time was over an hour. Pass. So, we jetted down the freeway to this location, which is typically slow. And it was. We got seated within 2 minutes of arrival. The staff at CPK are always friendly, and they give you plenty of room to eat and relax. I loathe waiters who think they need to ask how everything is every 5 minutes. When something's bad, trust me, you'll know.  We got a couple of pies on honey wheat dough, pepperoni for her, Jamaican jerk chicken for me. Now, we both noticed that it seems they're slowly but surely shrinking the pizza here. They used to be at least an 1"" or 2"" larger. Damn economy. Mine was slightly overcooked, but nothing worth making a fuss about. It was an adequate meal overall.

Tried to place the order online but it wouldn't let me set the time for pick up for same day.  So, I called back at 9:34 to ask if I could place a phone order and the girl tells me no, I can't place an order because the Pick Up order cut off is 9:30. I tell her it's 9:34 and the person I spoke to earlier should have said something to me if there was a cutoff. I ask her, ""So you're telling me that if I walk in and place an order, you won't wrap it up for me to take home?"" And she tells me no.  My husband went in, because he was already there since I said I was placing an order and at 9:35 they told him they shut the kitchen early due to lack of traffic. Gee, no wonder.

Brandon C.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",1,34,1,4.0,6/10/2014,"I went with my family on Sunday around 1:00 pm for lunch.  There was no problem finding parking - which can be an issue near the restaurant.  Hostess was very nice and made sure we were seated quickly, in about 5 minutes. The table was clean, as well as the seats. Our server (Quinn) was fantastic and very attentive.  They have a promotion for their rewards plan, so we signed up for free and received a small plate as a reward.  We ordered the Spicy Chicken Tinga Quesadilla and it tasted great.  They did bring bread that was different than they used to do.  I prefer the old way they did things with the bread and butter that was provided before.  The new approach is good, bread and olive oil, but we have a preference for the old way. We ordered pasta, a Chinese chicken salad and two pasta dishes for the kids.  We were very satisfied with the food which was hot and fresh out of the kitchen. What I really want to convey is the outstanding service provided by Quinn (female).  The order was correct, the food arrived quickly, the small plate arrived right away and in plenty of time to enjoy it before the meal arrived.  We did not want for anything.  She was quick on the re-fills for the drinks and made sure any plates were cleared quickly.  We were very, very satisfied with the service and based on that alone, will go back to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=80

I called the manager when I got home, and she didn't take me seriously, said she didn't notice anything, and told me the smells must have come from across the street, and it was a city problem. I do not plan to return to this location. It is very unappetizing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=40

We ordered for curbside and the person who took the order over the phone was very friendly and helpful.  The bbq chicken salad we ordered was huge, but they only gave us a half-full cup of ranch dressing it was nowhere near enough! The bbq chicken pizza we asked to be made into a thin crust (which cost extra to do) just looked like they made it bigger but used the same amount of ingredients. We also ordered a roasted garlic pizza which apparently has no sauce or flavor.

I love CPK and the family decided to come here tonight for dinner. We waited through an empty waiting area to a full waiting area and then again to an empty one. I literally was watching people walk out the door (finished with their meals) that came in after us. We had 3 adults and 2 kids in our group and they couldn't find a place for us to sit (although they sat a larger group that came in after us after a while). They tried putting us in a booth that literally my infant carrier wouldn't even fit in. When we told the host that it didn't fit and that it was too small, he just stared at us. I eventually said, can you please tell us what you'd like us to do because we can't leave the baby in the middle of the table. We ended up leaving.  Honestly, we will stick with the Laguna Hills or Tustin Market Place one. Much better service there.  I will say that Reid was pretty nice and tried to help us (hence the extra star), but the manager and the other host were not so helpful.

Strange to see mine priced without the w/chicken yet the tequila pasta was given the chicken price even without chicken. Also,we had about a 35 min drive home and maybe the wait dried out the pasta, who knows, but it was UNUSUALLY dry from our normal orders at other locations. Even the pizza had little to no red sauce. Really disappointed. Dinner was the most bland I've experienced so I wonder if their ingredients or quality of ingredients have changed along with their decor??

Megan H.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",19,197,347,3.0,8/21/2017,"I've been here multiple times, and I really like the updated menu. I can't eat pizza, so I usually go for the salads. I have tried:  Quinoa Arugula Salad-this is my favorite item on the entire menu. I love arugula and quinoa, and the dressing is delicious. It tastes even better if you add chicken (but that's like $4 extra). Roasted Vegetable Salad- I honestly don't think you need to add any protein to it; it is delicious as it is. Although, they drenched mine in too much dressing. I like the roasted eggplant.  Banh Mi Bowl-this sounded really good and healthy so I had to try it out. It was hard to eat because the carrots were spiralized really big. I also didn't like the bean sprouts. From the menu, I couldn't tell if it was a salad or a bowl kind of deal. It's basically a salad, and there wasn't that much food on the plate.  The prices here are too expensive for the type of restaurant it is. Most salads are $11-$13 but to add protein it's an extra $4-$6! The food is pretty good, but I'll stick to my usual. For appetizers, definitely order the dumplings. They also give you free bread. The last time I was here, the service was great. Our waitress was friendly and the food came out very quick.

It's been several years since it changed -- used to be a little sweeter and a little fluffier --  but I still miss it. It was just so good.  I digress - so - this specific location.  It's kind of weird - there are a lot of doors along the side, but there's only one hostess stand. If you enter through the door that is positioned closest to the parking lot, you have to walk through part of the dining room to get to the host stand. In my opinion, it's designed weird. I guess that door is there since it makes it easier for the staff to deliver takeout food to cars? But it's still weird for anyone who is dining in that vicinity.  There can sometimes be a small wait at this location, but I've never experienced anything too severe. There of been times when it's been a bit like a ghost town, but maybe I just eat at peculiar times? Who knows.  I do credit the business a lot - there really added some good things to the menu over the past year or so. I really like the Baja chicken spring rolls. Note that they are not your typical spring roll, but they are delicious nonetheless. There is also a delicious selection of salads. And of course - the pizzas.

My 3 friends and I came around 11:30 PM. It was before lunch rush, so wasn't too crowded.  Our server was attentive and friendly, and frequently came to check on us.  We all got the lunch special, a half pizza with soup or salad combo ($10.95). I highly recommend getting this for lunch since most of the other stuff on the menu is over $10.  I got a half BBQ chicken pizza with the Farmers Market soup. (Butternut squash soup) Food came in about 15 min.  My pizza had a fluffy crust with BBQ sauce with onions, chicken. I personally like crispy crust pizza, but it was well cooked.  The thing I didn't like was that it didn't have enough chicken. :(  The soup was hot and creamy, also chunky which I like.

I've always been a fan of the California Pizza Kitchen as their pizzas are quite yummy and just bursting with flavor and fresh ingredients which is something you usually don't get out of a chain! The real kicker for their pizza's has to be the wheat crust it is sooo delicious and just all around amazing when you add it to one of their delicious pizza concoctions as I really don't see very many pizza places that offer a wheat crust at all so it makes it a very tasty unique experience! Pretty much the only downfall I've really ever experienced at a CPK is their service it's generally a bit shaky always and I'm not really sure why so if you plan on visiting just be prepared for this. This time around we had their avocado club egg rolls they were super good and just all around scrumptious even more so when I added some of the sauce they gave us to them I'm not exactly sure how to describe the sauces but needless to say they were quite yummy! We had a pepperoni, sausage, & mushroom pizza on the wheat crust of course and after the first warm bite it was like wow this is quite yummy and just hit the spot for the both of us as we were a little bit wet from heading in from the pouring rain! Seriously though one of the funny parts of the night had to be that they were playing The Simpsons on the TV's throughout the CPK I mean come on who doesn't love them! Overall a visit to CPK is always a good choice and something that was long over do this past time and something that I'll make sure it's not years again before I head back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo
jasmin p.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,13,23,1.0,11/4/2016,The sangria tasted like fruit juice. I ordered a mushroom pasta dish that looked very good in the picture for $15! When it came it belly had any food in the dish and very little wild mushrooms and a little pasta. I don't eat much but I had to borrow food from my haughtiest and husbands dish. Our friends ordered pasta and they weren't very happy with their food either. Service was very lousy too. Too many tables for the servers to cover. We'll probably won't come back again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=60
Mel H.,"Orange County, CA",285,417,2654,5.0,8/2/2012,"Roasted Vegetable Salad with sautéed salmon.  The vegetables came out warm and roasted. :)  The sautéed salmon came out as small bite sized pieces. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was well seasoned, kind of peppery taste, and complemented the roasted vegetables tremendously well!!!!  TONS & TONS of roasted veggies GOODNESS!!!!! It all includes: asparagus, eggplant, zucchini, bell peppers and onions.  with roasted corn, sun-dried tomatoes and topped with AVOCADOS! ***My favorite. Avocados always saves the day and makes everything taste so much better :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=60
Louise R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,35,,1.0,10/2/2016,"My husband and I dined here 4 nights ago.  Our first option was an Italian restaurant nearby, but the wait was too long and we had a sitter at home to get back to.  So, we just decided to go with a good ole standard and eat at CPK.  When we walked in, there was a 10 minute wait.  I'd normally not wait for substandard food, but it was better than the wait time at our first choice.  So we stayed.  Several minutes after we walked in, a party of 7 walked in, they did NOT have a reservation, and they were seated before us!  Weird, I thought, there are PLENTY of empty tables so why would we still be waiting and this large party be seated?  We were finally seated at a table that had been empty the entire time we'd been waiting.  When we sat down, the table was dirty.  Oops!  So the hostess that didn't have the mostess (she had such a sour puss on her face!) came back and wiped it down with the enthusiasm of one that is relegated to cleaning toilets for a living.  We were finally helped by our server, at least she was smiling, but they seemed to have an issue because we waited FOREVER for our drinks and our appetizer came out 2 minutes before our entrees.  Also, I forgot to mention the plates were dirty, too.  And the bill was FAR too expensive for such a disappointing experience.  The staff was not happy to be there, the dishes and utensils were dirty, the service was slow, and the food was not great.  Reminds me why I rarely eat at CPK and I definitely won't be trying it again any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=60
Doug K.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,23,,1.0,1/16/2016,Huge fan of CPK but they eliminated virtually all comfortable booths for solid wood HARD chairs and tables.  Think McDonalds when it come to comfort.   WONT BE BACK!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=60

Richard L.,"Santa Ana, CA",139,14,3,1.0,12/24/2015,Didn't even get a chance to eat here.  If you're gonna advertise that you're open till a certain time you probably shouldn't shut down the kitchen 30 minutes prior to that time.  Definitely disappointed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=60
Parisa H.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1077,62,68,4.0,1/16/2015,This is my kids favorite Resturante. The food tastes great and the service is decent i am in love with their small plate menu and cannot get enough of their soups. My daughter is a big fan of BBQ Chicken pizza and my son obsessed with Mac and Cheese. Highly recommend for casual family lunch or dinner. Evenings and weekends get crazy busy. Call in advance and reserve your table.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=60
Hanna P.,"TRABUCO CANYON, CA",185,188,1214,4.0,9/19/2013,"In the past I have always just ordered their BBQ Chopped chicken salads, a popular go-to dish, but the last time I carb loaded I tried their garlic basil olive oil pasta and loved it.  I was excited to eat it again. We started our meal with one of their new flatbreads. Have you noticed how flatbreads have been trending lately? We tried their shaved mushroom and spinach flatbread and it was wonderful. So full of flavor packed onto a thin crispy flatbread. Great start. Apparently the garlic pasta is no longer on their menu and the server said its now a ""secret menu item"". Garlic olive oil pasta is as basic as it gets so not sure how its considered ""secret"" but when we received it, it was tomato based.  Not how we remembered it. Although I was confused I tried it anyways and it was just  Just didnt hit the spot for me. Maybe it should be kept secret?  The kids loved the Alfredo fusilli. For just a $1 more we got ice cream sundaes to top it off. Overall a decent dinner. I would definitely order their flatbread again and maybe next time stick to my roasted veggie salad or chopped BBQ chicken salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=60
Vincent M.,"Dana Point, CA",23,57,4,1.0,6/11/2016,"WOW..what a horrible experience.  We went at 9pm.  Two hostesses at front desk acted like we were bothering them,  Restaurant was more than 3/4 empty.  Dirty tables everywhere,. servers standing around, and still took us 5 minutes to get seated.  They brought us to a table with napkins and dirty food underneath it.  Also a 10 top table with unbused food was next to it which looked like it had been there for some time.  Asked for a booth..response was "" Well you will have to wait 10 minutes for us to clean a table""..We ask for manager, whose response was...""the hostesses just don't know any better.""  The customer who comes in an hour before closing should have the same experience as the first customer of the day.  they clearly just wanted to go home.  As regular customers of CPK, we will not being going back to this location.. there priorities and training are way off. Avoid Mission Viejo CPK!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=60
Jennifer C.,"Long Beach, CA",41,10,2,5.0,3/3/2016,"The food is honest, it's fresh, and always tasty! The service is alway great and very fast at this location. So far all of the servers I have had there are great and the Managers are always so friendly and they come by the table every time to make sure that everything is good. It's perfect for family night with the kids...my kids love CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=60
Sharron R.,"Oceanside, CA",21,43,3,3.0,11/23/2015,"I've always loved going to CPK, their salads are always delicious . I was kind of disappointed this time,  I had angel hair spaghetti and it was just OK.   It was dry and needed more sauce. They were very busy and by the time I could get the waitresses attention most of our group was finishing up their mail. They've always been good in the past so I will definitely give them another chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=60
Shawn L.,"Irvine, CA",0,3,,5.0,2/27/2016,"The food was delicious but for me the five stars was due for the server we had. Kurt is awesome. He is fast, polite, and just plain friendly.

Kurt you rock.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=60
Heidi S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",34,283,48,3.0,10/24/2015,"We stopped in for a late lunch. It wasn't too busy but the service was slow, not what it usually is at this location. I ordered the Italian chopped salad but either they don't chop it anymore like they used to or the cook used the wrong lettuce. I love a nice chopped salad.  This was the first time in this location with the new decor, I like it. It doesn't say 80s anymore, they did a good job updating the experience and adding new menu items...although I usually get the same thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=60
OC C.,"Mission Viejo, CA",27,19,1,5.0,4/29/2016,Giving the highest rating possible and it has nothing to do with the food. It is based entitled on the service we received. We went in on a Wednesday night and were seated in Luis' section. From now on I will request to be seated in his section. He was great. We had a party of 5 with 3 kids. Even my kids commented on how awesome he was.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=60
Michael B.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",945,264,623,5.0,9/27/2014,I always seem to enjoy California Pizza Kitchen and they seem to be very consistent between all of their change locations. This location is convenient here in the land of Suburbia of Mission Viejo. The wifi is excellent here and was easy to sign in with my iPad. I always enjoy the BBQ chicken pizza and it was great that they had stone IPA on tap. Everyone was very nice even though we had a very long meeting on a Friday night. I highly recommend California Pizza Kitchen because they have some salads also.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=60
K. W.,"San Clemente, CA",2,48,4,5.0,11/12/2015,"I have never ordered anything that was disappointing!  Recently tried their Margarita Pizza...unbelievable..loved it!  Would highly recommend their Arugula/Quinoa Salad and Mushroom/Spinach Flatbread.  I always try to remember to take a bottle of wine, since the corkage fee is only $5...their wines are pricey and not to my liking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=60
Sandy P.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",5,20,,3.0,7/13/2014,I've been coming here for years and mostly have a great experience. I used to get the Thai Crunch salad 2-3 times per week but the CPK corporate folks changed the chicken supplier and the chicken is a gross rubber mess now. My friends got other salads and it's the same gross chicken. Get another supplier! Salads are no stars now and I order something else. The manager confirmed they receive complaints on the new chicken and offered to grill me a piece instead of what's supplied. Mac and cheese bites and pizzas are good but I miss my Thai crunch. Please listen to a faithful customer and change your supplier. Thanks!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=60
Kay L.,"Overland Park, KS",288,713,91,4.0,8/14/2014,"I used to live quite close to this CPK & visited here many times.  The open design makes for an airy, spacious look, but at the cost of noise -- conversation is sometimes difficult if it's crowded.  Service has always been pleasant, and the food is consistently good -- they've recently changed the menu again, removed a couple things I like, added a couple new things to try -- so it goes as part of a corporate chain.  Love the salads, though, they're quite fresh & interesting.  Still a favorite stop when I go back to visit friends in the old neighborhood.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=60
Ryan M.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",45,87,20,4.0,9/4/2014,"I always enjoy going to CPK. They have consistently good food that is priced friendly for people. I never leave hungry. I generally order a pizza, after all it's in the name. ;p. I also like how they serve the bread now with the oil instead of butter.   As for desserts, I love the Buttercake. I don't get it often because I'm not a huge dessert eater. That being said, it's still scrumptious.  The restaurant has more parking around the back, which is good because sometimes I find during busy times that the parking lot in front of the restaurant (when turning in from the light) to be full or only have like 1 spot left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=60
Brian W.,"Laguna Beach, CA",37,21,10,4.0,9/4/2014,Had the small plate poblano and sausage pizza and a cut of pea and barley soup for lunch. Both were very tasty and the pizza was a suggestion from the server Tony. Just enough and not too full. Wasn't too crowded or loud and service was accommodating and not pushy. Took an iced tea to go and the cup was leaking so quickly replaced no trouble at all.  I would come back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=60
