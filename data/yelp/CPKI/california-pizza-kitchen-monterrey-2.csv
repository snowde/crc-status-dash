Jocelyn W.,"Austin, TX",113,101,18,1.0,5/23/2017,"Soggy greasy pizza - tastes nothing like CPK. They should be ashamed of selling their name for use at this restaurant. And to top off my crappy meal, I got my credit card number stolen. I know it was from here because it was the only place in Mexico I used this particular card. Luckily my bank alerted me to an almost $500 charge at a department store in Guadalajara that got denied so I was able to cancel the card before any damage was done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterrey-2
