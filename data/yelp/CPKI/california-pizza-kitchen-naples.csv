Kevin M.,"Fort Myers, FL",10,84,,4.0,11/6/2017,"Light lunch here Sunday - delightful. In Naples for a little shopping at Waterside. Nice spot, plenty of dining opportunities in addition to shopping. Valet parking available as well - who knew. Perhaps they don't walk in Naples. But I digress... Nice location; dine in or out or at the bar.  We sat outside.  You need a good 20 minutes to digest the menu - perhaps too many options.  We had a ""power bowl"" that was quite good. (Trying build our dark green antioxidant intake.) A Caesar Salad that hit the spot and a small garlic chicken pizza that was absolutely delicious. Melt in your mouth crust; great balance of flavors that married extremely well. The service was friendly and well intentioned, if a bit slow. But never a problem. Nice, relaxed ambiance. A very nice experience overall. Great food, good service. Recommended.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-naples
Summer F.,"Boca Raton, FL",142,26,162,5.0,5/14/2017,"Happy Mother's Day to all of the mom's out there today!  The restaurant has been redone with a modern feel. Since CPK doesn't take reservations, we called them 15-20minutes ahead of our arrival time to have our name on the list for a table of 6 people. Once we arrived, we waited about 10-15 minutes for a 6 person table to open up, which wasn't too bad since it's Mother's Day.  Throughout our time at CPK, there were a few bumps in the road. The difference in this restaurant is the way the manager and our server handled each problem that arose in a calm and professional manor. The manager Rich and our server Jose were very accommodating, diligent, and friendly. We will definitely be back for another visit.  The different plates we ordered were delicious and had great presentation. For an appetizer, we ordered the spinach artichoke dip and it was tasty, like always. The original steak entree my brother ordered was much much too rare and his potatoes were ice cold. They took back his meal and brought out a fresh one, perfectly cooked and warm. The other meals were great, I would definitely recommend the BBQ chicken pizza with pineapple or if you like a little spice - the Thai chicken pizza.  They added some new healthy power bowls to the menu. We got the Banh Mi Bowl and it was delicious, but the portion size of each item in the bowl was pretty small. Great for people eating healthy and watching their portion size. The dressing also had a kick to it, so be prepared!  For dessert we had the key lime pie and Belgian chocolate soufflé cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. They were both delicious, but if I had to pick one, the chocolate soufflé is the winner.  Overall, the experience was great and made for a wonderful Mother's Day lunch! The customer service from the manager and server blew us away, thank you guys so much!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-naples
Andy V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",937,1412,6952,3.0,3/22/2016,"Even though there is one close to home I figured why not give this place a try? The location is petty small so expect to wait on a Friday or Saturday night. The staff was friendly and attentive. The avocado rolls are my go-to pick for an appetizer. And I love their tortilla soup. I ordered the roasted garlic chicken pizza which I would not recommend. The pizza was good but the chicken was not. I don't think I can recommend any pizza with chicken. It tastes very chewy. It's not fresh. You can tell its some type of prepackaged/refrigerated version. Not the end of the world, I just learned my lesson. I love the outdoor seating arrangement. I noticed a few tables sending things back which is never a good sign. I would have liked to have done the same but I knew I would have to get something completely different to enjoy my meal so I just dealt with it. Next time I'll try something new but overall was an ok experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-naples

Jamie K.,"Naples, FL",72,614,5,4.0,1/9/2017,"Nice upscale restaurant. Not only pizza, but great pasta and apps. The hummus was excellent with warm flat bread. The spinach dip was good, the chips were not warm, kinda looked and tasted like they were straight out of the bag. Had the two soups in one bowl, pea and barley soup was awesome and the farmers market was equally good. Ask for bread with dipping oil and fresh herbs,  great. The butter cake with icecream was good, a bit sweet. They were out of the chocolate souffle cake, so we had the butter cake on the house because it was my wife's birthday. Great service and nice atmosphere next to window. Wonderful menu, would of liked to of had a few items. A little pricey, but not too bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-naples
Richard N.,"Naples, FL",15,240,298,4.0,12/10/2016,"We took too long getting back to CPK. They really know how to do things. They serve good food with a smile and reasonable prices.  We had the traditional chopped salad and the Pad Thai pasta. Both were great. The best part is they know how to do portions. Too many restaurants feel the need to serve heaping portions on your plate. They deserve a lot of credit for that. The price is also great. Dinner for two, including the tip, was under $40.00. And that is in a Waterside restaurant. OMG.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-naples
Pamela F.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,441,624,4.0,1/6/2016,"Ever since we left California I've missed this airy puff of a crust and the sweet hot peanut tang of Thai chicken pizza --mmm.

Wonderful!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-naples

Roxanne B.,"Lisbon, ME",60,59,97,3.0,3/19/2016,It's good but not super impressive. Decent location and a comfy atmosphere. I had the margarita pasta and though good I don't know that it was really $13 good. The mango lemonade was also a little too sweet and artificial flavoury. Finally our waitress seemed a little spacey and it wasn't even that busy. If they get a location near me I'd go once in a while but I probably won't go out of my way to come again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-naples
Zac P.,"Tolland, CT",13,7,,4.0,5/15/2017,"Service was quick. Was seated and knew what we wanted and took no more than 15 minutes to come out. Shrimp was a little burnt and had no kick to it.

Arlene H.,"Naples, FL",324,130,336,5.0,10/20/2014,"I rarely hand out 5 stars to just any major chain restaurant, but I am a strong believer in the changes that CPK has made for the better. First off, I'm in love with the renovations and floor plan.  Prior to the reno, some areas did not make sense with workflow.  Now, the table set-up makes a lot more sense, and it feels like they added more seating.  The wood slat designs on the wall, chairs and tables, matched by the metal frames make it casual, but casually spectacular.  Clean lines and it feels clean too.  They also have a beautiful bar area that opens up to the outside patio.  The indoor and outdoor space are congruous with each other.  The bar top is this huge slab of white quartz?  I think they did a phenomenal job in keeping with the elegance of Waterside Shops, but with purpose in keeping it casual.  Maybe the demographic might shift this season and call for people who would like to stay past 9pm. And then there's the FABULOUS menu.  I have tried their new flatbreads: the bianco - their white cheese pizza, their mushroom and spinach, spicy sausage and poblano pepper, and their ham and swiss.  Don't worry.  Not all at the same time.  They all are worth trying. CPK also has a seasonal menu.  This go-round, they have a bacon, potato, leek and sunny-side up egg pizza.  WHAT? Breakfast comfort at its finest.  A fried egg doesn't just go on a burger to be ""cool"". There a ton of salads to choose from, but I tried their quinoa and arugula salad.  It had sundried tomatoes, pine nuts, asparagus, feta, onions, and it was lightly dressed, or not even dressed at all....this was a good thing.  It paired nicely with my ham and swiss flatbread. Tip on salads:  Half salads are plenty enough for one meal, or get a whole to split.  I still ordered a half salad and ended up taking some home with me.  (However, the leftovers got gobbled up within 5 minutes of entry into the fridge.) If there's enough room, you must try their pumpkin cheesecake! To summarize, if you want to get sneak away from the hoity toity crowds in close proximity, hang out, have a drink, and watch a little tv at CPK while feasting on fresh and innovative menu choices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-naples
Bramel W.,"Naples, FL",5,12,22,3.0,4/10/2015,"Consistent food ~ but does this beverage look complete / bartender tried to tell me the drink is supposed to be 1.5"" short of the top of the glass. Ehhhhhh don't think so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-naples
Heather W.,"Rochester, NY",11,17,17,5.0,4/26/2016,"We were seated quickly, had an amazing server Steph, and had some delicious sangria with our lunch.

Shsail S.,"Mount Laurel, NJ",0,112,14,4.0,3/25/2016,"This place is great spot for girls to stop midway during their shopping spree! Reasonably priced for delicious light food. Place does get very busy on holiday weeks, so be patient.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-naples
Gloria S.,"Naples, FL",383,818,2380,4.0,2/27/2011,"Why would a gluten free person eat here?  No need to eat pizza if you come.  Menu is varied and heathy.  I like the lettuce wraps and can have the tortilla soup. They offer a menu for light meals, service is always good. During season we sit at the counter that faces the open kitchen. You can keep an eye on the TV and your food (make sure no one sneezes on your pizza.) Otherwise there is usually a wait for a table. Sit in with the locals or outside with the tourists. On the higher side in prices but join the club online to get specials.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-naples
Dayhanna A.,"Orlando, FL",39,16,47,5.0,12/15/2014,"I had the opportunity to go to California Pizza Kitchen for a networking event and was able to taste most of the items on their menu. The food was unbelievable and the staff was welcoming, attentive and knowledgeable.  Some of my favorites in the menu:  The cedar plank salmon -  was fantastic!!  I've had so many bad experiences with overcooked fish, but this was definitely not the case at CPK, the salmon was cooked to that perfect delicious point and  the corn with feta side dish was incredible! The Ribeye steak with the Pinot Noir salt made my night. I have gone to steak houses that cost a fortune, and would still choose CPK's Ribeye stake over the more expensive alternatives. My favorite dessert was the butter cake, it was to die for ! I was so relieved that the meals at the event were meant to be shared because had I had the chance I probably would've devoured the entire thing.  If you want amazing service, delicious food and a restaurant that has enough variety to satisfy anyone on your table, you absolutely need to try California Pizza Kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-naples
Aileen G.,"Naples, FL",40,6,2,5.0,7/26/2015,"Very clean and attentive service. I always try to change up what dish I'll be getting and everything I've had has been pretty good. My two favorites by far though would have to be the Tortilla soup and the Split Pea and Barley soup as well. As you can tell I am a soup person. But their pizza are great too. For dessert we never fail to get the Butter Cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Definitely recommend it.

Steven B.,"Toronto, Canada",3,12,13,4.0,4/11/2016,"I just ate dinner here for the first time, this evening, with my dad and brother.  The service was arguably the best I have ever experienced at a restaurant.  We were promptly seated by our hostess (her name escapes me).  It was her first day and she was very kind and unusually friendly (in a good way).  Next our waitress came and introduced herself (Brianna).  She was gorgeous, very charming and seemed genuinely interested in making sure our dining experience was as pleaurable as possible.  She deserves a raise; STAT.  The manager (I believe), Steve also introduced himself shortly after we were seated.  He was very kind and esger to converse.  As for the food; it was all very tasty.  The pizza crust was lovely and very light, and didn't leave us feeling like we had bricks in our stomach when we were done.  The avocado egg rolls we had as appetizers were exquisite.  My dad and I ordered key lime pie for dessert.  The waitress told us that they had run out of it, apologized, then asked if we would like something else from the dessert menu; on the house.  Overall, we were very pleased with the food and service and will mostly likely be back next time we're in Naples.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-naples?start=20

Sydney P.,"Naples, FL",14,92,2,4.0,10/25/2012,"My husband & I both really like CPK. It's been a little difficult working our way around the menu, because when I find something I love, I want to stop there, but I soldier on, and we make efforts to try one new thing a trip. What I love: the pizzas (!), the pesto cream pasta, the desserts, their new little bites apps ( specially the Quesadilla one). I get a little confused because the quesadilla clearly has nothing to do with my pesto main dish, but  I am not a fine diner, and this is not a classic Italian place. Two misses for us were the Guac appetizer ( tasteless), and the bread you can have brought to your table upon request ( cold bread, rock-hard butter, just like any cafeteria experience.) Our service has always been great. Last visit we had an issue with our apps which needed to be addressed by management and it was all handled graciously and way beyond our satisfaction. Also I tend to be one of THOSE people who tweak things to get to my perfect dish,( I prefer fett vs. penne, add sundrieds, etc) and they accommodate me w/out blinking an eye. The only thing that keeps us from stopping by much more often is they close around 9pm ( yay. Naples.) Which means if you get there by 8, you'll be one of the last tables. Prices and portions are very fair in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-naples?start=20
Dianne H.,"Winnipeg, Canada",0,14,,2.0,12/29/2014,"The pizza menu is extensive and unusual.  I like trying new interesting combinations but I think from now on, when it comes to pizza, I will go with what I know. I had the Tostada Pizza (12.89). My husband had the Jamaican Jerk Pizza (13.79). We would not order either one again. The combinations were too odd. The draft beer was expensive at  $4.79.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-naples?start=20
Molly K.,"Naples, FL",5,4,,1.0,2/13/2015,"I'm honestly very disappointed with my visit. I called 3 days ahead to attempt to make a reservation. I was told that I couldn't but I could make a reservation 30 minutes ahead of the time I'd be arriving. However, the manager assured me that a party of my size would be easily able to be seated at the time and day I was planning on dining. I then called 30 minutes before my arrival. When I got there, the manager informed me that calling 30 minutes ahead did not actually reserve a table but simply notified the restaurant that we would be arriving and I would have to wait another 30 minutes. That would have been a great thing to inform me of on the phone. After voicing my concerns to the manager, he proceeded to rudely argue with me and ended the conversation with threats to make my party wait longer. My large party was forced to wait outside in freezing weather. On a positive note, the server was wonderful and very helpful. I would also like to include that as my party was walking out, one of the waitresses pointed at my group and asked the manager if we were ""the party."" I guess the manager could not help but to talk poorly and gossip about my group like a teenage girl. His attitude was terrible and overwhelming. I will never be coming back to this restaurant and strongly advise everyone else not to dine here unless they would like to receive snarky attitude from the manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-naples?start=20
Brian D.,"Naples, FL",48,34,,2.0,7/9/2014,Not sure where to begin. We were a party of 6 service was slow they were kind of busy perhaps understaffed. Our server took our order and forgot our salads I told her when our entrees arrived to cancel our salads and she said 'oh so you don't want it now '  Our drinks were refilled once and she dropped the check while we were still eating and tried to take our food away while we were still eating and did not offer us the dessert menu.

And yes, a trip to Naples isn't complete for my our without a trip here...due in large part to the Waterside Shops Location, the Apple Store, the fountains, Barnes and Noble, etc., etc. This trip didn't disappoint. Our daughter loved her pint-sized pepperoni pizza and grooved on the nachos/spinach dip appetizer. (Although - my wife pointed out the nachos were absolutely stale. While we'd been on the road for hours, we devoured them without complaint because the dip was the saving grace). More importantly both the new quinoa salad and the peach green salad were out of this world. We ordered to smaller portions of these and delighted in their preparation and freshness. For a mid afternoon Sunday, there were hardly any patrons, and while we had an incredibly friendly server - she wasn't able to get out of her own way to provide timely and attentive service.

Cesar S.,"Framingham, MA",111,103,27,3.0,8/17/2011,"I am a well-established fan of the CPK chain of restaurants.  As you yelpers know, the appropriate rating for my review would therefore be 4 stars.  I was compelled to review this particular CPK not to tell you about my favorite dishes here like the tortilla soup, the Waldorf Salad or the Spinach and Artichoke thin-crust pizza.  But instead, to express my disappointment with the level of service my family and I experienced today.  We came in to the CPK at the Waterside Shops to celebrate along with 5 other members of my family.  There was no wait.... until we arrived.  There were no tables for six available at the moment.  Normally, one would expect to receive an estimate of how long the wait will be for a table.  Not today.  The staff instead, felt it necessary to explain to us that there were other customers that were done eating dinner and that were sitting at their table talking.  We were informed that she could not give us an estimate of how long the wait would be.  After about 20 minutes of waiting, I asked again.  The staff again repeated the same story.  I really don't care to hear staff commenting negatively on other parties in their restaurant.  I just want to know how long we are going to have to wait!!!   I then asked her to tell me how long she believed it would take for the second table that could accommodate our party to become available.  She said, about another 20 minutes.  Wow!?!  Was that so difficult now?

If you sit on the patio you get to see *really* chunky people valet their cars instead of walking twenty steps to the three restaurants in this area of the mall. Anyway, back to the food - the pizza is fresh and edible. I had the goat cheese, pepper and caramalized onion and my dad went more traditional (this is tough at a place that serves tandoori and mango pizza), with the sausage and mushroom. He finished his.

Summer F.,"Boca Raton, United States",142,26,162,5.0,14/5/2017,"Happy Mother's Day to all of the mom's out there today!  The restaurant has been redone with a modern feel. Since CPK doesn't take reservations, we called them 15-20minutes ahead of our arrival time to have our name on the list for a table of 6 people. Once we arrived, we waited about 10-15 minutes for a 6 person table to open up, which wasn't too bad since it's Mother's Day.  Throughout our time at CPK, there were a few bumps in the road. The difference in this restaurant is the way the manager and our server handled each problem that arose in a calm and professional manor. The manager Rich and our server Jose were very accommodating, diligent, and friendly. We will definitely be back for another visit.  The different plates we ordered were delicious and had great presentation. For an appetizer, we ordered the spinach artichoke dip and it was tasty, like always. The original steak entree my brother ordered was much much too rare and his potatoes were ice cold. They took back his meal and brought out a fresh one, perfectly cooked and warm. The other meals were great, I would definitely recommend the BBQ chicken pizza with pineapple or if you like a little spice - the Thai chicken pizza.  They added some new healthy power bowls to the menu. We got the Banh Mi Bowl and it was delicious, but the portion size of each item in the bowl was pretty small. Great for people eating healthy and watching their portion size. The dressing also had a kick to it, so be prepared!  For dessert we had the key lime pie and Belgian chocolate soufflé cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. They were both delicious, but if I had to pick one, the chocolate soufflé is the winner.

Andy V.,"Fort Lauderdale, United States",937,1412,6952,3.0,22/3/2016,"Even though there is one close to home I figured why not give this place a try? The location is petty small so expect to wait on a Friday or Saturday night. The staff was friendly and attentive. The avocado rolls are my go-to pick for an appetizer. And I love their tortilla soup. I ordered the roasted garlic chicken pizza which I would not recommend. The pizza was good but the chicken was not. I don't think I can recommend any pizza with chicken. It tastes very chewy. It's not fresh. You can tell its some type of prepackaged/refrigerated version. Not the end of the world, I just learned my lesson. I love the outdoor seating arrangement. I noticed a few tables sending things back which is never a good sign. I would have liked to have done the same but I knew I would have to get something completely different to enjoy my meal so I just dealt with it. Next time I'll try something new but overall was an ok experience.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-naples

Had the two soups in one bowl, pea and barley soup was awesome and the farmers market was equally good. Ask for bread with dipping oil and fresh herbs,  great. The butter cake with icecream was good, a bit sweet. They were out of the chocolate souffle cake, so we had the butter cake on the house because it was my wife's birthday.

We had the traditional chopped salad and the Pad Thai pasta. Both were great. The best part is they know how to do portions. Too many restaurants feel the need to serve heaping portions on your plate. They deserve a lot of credit for that. The price is also great. Dinner for two, including the tip, was under $40.00.

Arlene H.,"Naples, United States",324,130,336,5.0,20/10/2014,"I rarely hand out 5 stars to just any major chain restaurant, but I am a strong believer in the changes that CPK has made for the better. First off, I'm in love with the renovations and floor plan.  Prior to the reno, some areas did not make sense with workflow.  Now, the table set-up makes a lot more sense, and it feels like they added more seating.  The wood slat designs on the wall, chairs and tables, matched by the metal frames make it casual, but casually spectacular.  Clean lines and it feels clean too.  They also have a beautiful bar area that opens up to the outside patio.  The indoor and outdoor space are congruous with each other.  The bar top is this huge slab of white quartz?  I think they did a phenomenal job in keeping with the elegance of Waterside Shops, but with purpose in keeping it casual.  Maybe the demographic might shift this season and call for people who would like to stay past 9pm. And then there's the FABULOUS menu.  I have tried their new flatbreads: the bianco - their white cheese pizza, their mushroom and spinach, spicy sausage and poblano pepper, and their ham and swiss.  Don't worry.  Not all at the same time.  They all are worth trying. CPK also has a seasonal menu.  This go-round, they have a bacon, potato, leek and sunny-side up egg pizza.  WHAT? Breakfast comfort at its finest.  A fried egg doesn't just go on a burger to be ""cool"". There a ton of salads to choose from, but I tried their quinoa and arugula salad.  It had sundried tomatoes, pine nuts, asparagus, feta, onions, and it was lightly dressed, or not even dressed at all....this was a good thing.  It paired nicely with my ham and swiss flatbread. Tip on salads:  Half salads are plenty enough for one meal, or get a whole to split.  I still ordered a half salad and ended up taking some home with me.  (However, the leftovers got gobbled up within 5 minutes of entry into the fridge.) If there's enough room, you must try their pumpkin cheesecake! To summarize, if you want to get sneak away from the hoity toity crowds in close proximity, hang out, have a drink, and watch a little tv at CPK while feasting on fresh and innovative menu choices.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-naples

They offer a menu for light meals, service is always good. During season we sit at the counter that faces the open kitchen.

Dayhanna A.,"Orlando, United States",39,16,47,5.0,15/12/2014,"I had the opportunity to go to California Pizza Kitchen for a networking event and was able to taste most of the items on their menu. The food was unbelievable and the staff was welcoming, attentive and knowledgeable.  Some of my favorites in the menu:  The cedar plank salmon -  was fantastic!!  I've had so many bad experiences with overcooked fish, but this was definitely not the case at CPK, the salmon was cooked to that perfect delicious point and  the corn with feta side dish was incredible! The Ribeye steak with the Pinot Noir salt made my night. I have gone to steak houses that cost a fortune, and would still choose CPK's Ribeye stake over the more expensive alternatives. My favorite dessert was the butter cake, it was to die for ! I was so relieved that the meals at the event were meant to be shared because had I had the chance I probably would've devoured the entire thing.

Sydney P.,"Naples, United States",14,92,2,4.0,25/10/2012,"My husband & I both really like CPK. It's been a little difficult working our way around the menu, because when I find something I love, I want to stop there, but I soldier on, and we make efforts to try one new thing a trip. What I love: the pizzas (!), the pesto cream pasta, the desserts, their new little bites apps ( specially the Quesadilla one). I get a little confused because the quesadilla clearly has nothing to do with my pesto main dish, but  I am not a fine diner, and this is not a classic Italian place. Two misses for us were the Guac appetizer ( tasteless), and the bread you can have brought to your table upon request ( cold bread, rock-hard butter, just like any cafeteria experience.) Our service has always been great. Last visit we had an issue with our apps which needed to be addressed by management and it was all handled graciously and way beyond our satisfaction. Also I tend to be one of THOSE people who tweak things to get to my perfect dish,( I prefer fett vs. penne, add sundrieds, etc) and they accommodate me w/out blinking an eye. The only thing that keeps us from stopping by much more often is they close around 9pm ( yay. Naples.) Which means if you get there by 8, you'll be one of the last tables.

However, the manager assured me that a party of my size would be easily able to be seated at the time and day I was planning on dining. I then called 30 minutes before my arrival. When I got there, the manager informed me that calling 30 minutes ahead did not actually reserve a table but simply notified the restaurant that we would be arriving and I would have to wait another 30 minutes. That would have been a great thing to inform me of on the phone. After voicing my concerns to the manager, he proceeded to rudely argue with me and ended the conversation with threats to make my party wait longer. My large party was forced to wait outside in freezing weather. On a positive note, the server was wonderful and very helpful. I would also like to include that as my party was walking out, one of the waitresses pointed at my group and asked the manager if we were ""the party."" I guess the manager could not help but to talk poorly and gossip about my group like a teenage girl. His attitude was terrible and overwhelming.

Our daughter loved her pint-sized pepperoni pizza and grooved on the nachos/spinach dip appetizer. (Although - my wife pointed out the nachos were absolutely stale. While we'd been on the road for hours, we devoured them without complaint because the dip was the saving grace). More importantly both the new quinoa salad and the peach green salad were out of this world. We ordered to smaller portions of these and delighted in their preparation and freshness. For a mid afternoon Sunday, there were hardly any patrons, and while we had an incredibly friendly server - she wasn't able to get out of her own way to provide timely and attentive service.
