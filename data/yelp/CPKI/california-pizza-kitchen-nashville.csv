ImaYelper Y.,"San Diego, CA",55,228,107,4.0,11/5/2017,Awesome salads.  The bbq chicken is my favorite because it has lots of tasty vegetables and the fresh taste of lime along with the crunch of the tortilla strips.  The pizzas are all good too but they got rid of our favorite habanero and we haven't found a suitable replacement yet that can compare. Their takeout is a great option.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville
Charlotte L.,"Nashville, TN",19,90,132,3.0,8/24/2017,"This is a fine spot for a perfectly serviceable meal. They have a reasonably priced wine list. Decent servers. A wide range of menu options. The feel is quite corporate, so I wouldn't recommend it if you want anything innovative or intimate. That said, there are some standout dishes (I'm looking at you Roasted Veggie Salad!) that merit a return.  Parking is easy, and the space is large, so I haven't ever had a wait. It's a great spot for an easy, satisfying lunch if you are out running errands in Green Hills.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville
Beth G.,"Nashville, TN",470,369,645,3.0,12/12/2016,"Christmas in Green Hills at lunch time. California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) was not packed, the parking garage was quite full. One half of CPK was available, but the wait was 10-15 minutes. Obvioulsy odd and yes I asked why. The staff was not available to get to all the tables was their response. It was cold outside, our party was hangry and getting more grouchy.  After our obligatory 15 minute wait, we were sat and waited another 10 minutes. Our server was an Angel and in good spirits. Ordering was easy. She forgot the bread, did not realize until after we paid and were walking out.  Food IMHO a bit over priced for pizza, but it is CPK. The pour wine in ounces. Nice to be detailed oriented and correct in your very own 2 glass presentation. 1 to drink in and 1 to show how many ounces you ordered.    Ordered the Buffalo cauliflower appetizer, the chicken quac egg rolls and supreme pizza and chocolate cake. All very tastey and nicely presented and quick to all be served.   We downloaded the app and received a free small plate. Server forgot, we reminded her. For all the times we come to CPK, food is consistent and bill is higher than it should be. Can't blame Green Hills for that, CPK is CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville
Steven W.,"Franklin, TN",66,85,115,5.0,4/4/2017,This is a great location. It's never too crowded and servers are attentive but not clingy. I have ordered the Original BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad at least 20 times - the half is plenty.  Tonight we ordered the White Corn Guacamole and it's also very good.  A cold Blue Moon for me and the BlueberryGinger Smash for the little lady. S. Pelegrín on ice with lemons and limes hits the spot. Highly recommend.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville
Nashville T.,"Nashville, TN",0,41,4,1.0,9/8/2017,We ate here the other night.  Few people around.   Service was slow.  Salad tasted like it was bought from Kroger packaged salads and topped off with dry chicken.  I think the restaurant needs corporate help.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville

Kimberly M.,"Franklin, TN",0,53,13,2.0,4/7/2017,"We do not live near this California pizza kitchen, but we were at an event in Nashville and decided to go in there for a late dinner. I was sad that the quality of food and service had gone so far down compared to visits in the past. My daughter's pesto cream pasta had very little sauce and very little flavor. The chicken on my chicken Thai pizza, one of their signature dishes, tasted like it had been pre-cooked and was extremely dry. I used to love this pizza! Our waitress was very friendly, but the restaurant wasn't busy and for almost 10 minutes after we ordered something to drink she did not reappear. She seemed rushed.

But I can't say I'll be back just because of how uncomfortable it was inside.  This restaurant was FREEZING. It was January, probably 60 degrees outside, but inside felt very chilly and I kept my jacket on. As soon as I walked in I felt cold and wanted to leave. If you put your hand out you could feel the cold breeze in the air. I don't know if it was an AC thing or if the kitchen got too hot or if it's a plot to get you in and out faster, but it was miserable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville
Noah T.,"Panama City Beach, FL",0,3,,1.0,10/19/2016,"Pro-tip: don't give them your business between the hours of 6pm and 8pm. Terrible take out experience with them. Ordered the food over the phone and was told it would be ready for pickup 17 minutes later, and to call upon arrival for curbside pickup. It all started when they wouldn't even pick up their phone after 10 phone calls. I eventually went inside to ask what the problem was, and one of their employees was extremely rude. In reading other reviews here, the employee by which should be referred to as Man Bun, was the rude employee in question. Besides giving me a very strong attitude, he also proceeded to walk away without even addressing my concerns.  To my surprise it actually took them over an hour to even have my food out of the oven. Avoid when they're even slightly busy, as their management cannot clearly handle a Wednesday evening rush.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville
Nadine b.,"Lewisburg, TN",44,1,,5.0,7/17/2017,"They have he best customer service and they have he best pizza around.  As far as I'm concerned and we drove 60 minutes just to eat there ,,,,,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville
James S.,"Nashville, TN",13,105,6,1.0,7/25/2016,"We had a gravely disappointing - and brief - visit to CPK thanks to an individual we'll call ""Man Bun"" to preserve his anonymity, if not his dignity.    We arrived Saturday evening, having driven from Brentwood specifically to visit CPK.  We hadn't been in a while and were craving some pizza.  Unfortunately, all we got was a hearty portion of salt. As the hostess began to seat us, she asked Man Bun if he would mind having us in his section, to which he responded under his breath ""Well I don't think I have a choice."" Yikes.  He didn't think I heard him, but he wasn't exactly discreet.  Naturally, we just chose to leave, as it was quite off-putting and we were trying to enjoy a date.  To be fair, everyone has bad days.  Perhaps Man Bun's man bun was just pulled a little too tightly.  Maybe he was running low on hair ties?  Maybe his PBR had gotten warm in the kitchen?  Who knows, but I don't think I'll be back.  tl;dr: CPK giving bad service before giving bad service was cool.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville

Lanny C.,"Brentwood, TN",0,2,,1.0,7/18/2016,Very disappointed in our visit. Service was terrible. Ordered salads and flatbread but when our salads came we were told flatbread had just gone into oven. Finally arrived and was jokingly told it just arrived in the mail.  Asked for sweetener but finally I went to another table to get this myself.  And lastly our bill was screwed up. Just wanted to get out of there so paid what it said and left rather than trying to get this corrected.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville
Jacob V.,"Nashville, TN",42,20,,1.0,4/23/2017,"Last visit. This is the fourth, and worst visit to this location. Typically, the food is great, and service is lacking, but this time even the food was gross. The server forgot about us, when reminded, acted as if he was bothered to be reminded. Neglected to refill beverage glasses for a long while, never bothered to provide plates for appetizer, and the general attitude amongst the staff was just careless and annoyed. There were multiple tables that had been empty and not cleared, dirty floors, and restrooms. Not sure what's going on here, but they need a makeover.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville
Maria K.,"Nashville, TN",127,187,82,4.0,2/7/2016,"YUM! This place is so great. I came to this location during the noon rush, and it was surprisingly not busy whatsoever. We were quickly seated into a comfy and cozy booth and were immediately served with sourdough bread and olive oil (my fav). The menu here is very odd, they have some weird stuff. I ended up not being adventurous and just choosing the Pepperoni pizza. Though it was simple, it was delicious! I loved the crust and they put some yummy herbs on top that added a unique flavor to a traditional meal.  Service was average, I expected better though. Overall a pretty positive experience. I will most certainly return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville

Katie I.,"Nashville, TN",130,332,852,4.0,1/15/2016,"Kid friendly, yet an upscale feeling where you can enjoy a drink at the bar. Pizzas are ok, nothing special. I'd recommend thin crust. They have a great kids menu with varied options. I personally like the salmon entree with the spinach corn side that is quite delish and the chicken piccata. For a chain, it's not bad, and the service has always been accommodating and friendly. Kids sundae for $.99 is a deal and delicious. (According to my kids) :) it's one of those go-to staples in the hood.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville
Paul K.,"Nashville, TN",110,628,552,2.0,8/26/2015,"Slightly below average CPK Wait staff should understand if there's a party of six adults and a toddler who really wants apple juice, serve the toddler first. Not deliver the adults drinks and then leave us to try and explain to a two year old that the waiter forgot them for eight minutes. Other than that, pizza doesn't pop like at other CPKs I've attended. It was good, just not as good as an average CPK and it's flippin pricey for drinks.

Ashley R.,"Denver, CO",1,14,,1.0,2/14/2017,"Came here for dinner with my mom and sister and while the food was great as usual, the service has gone completely down hill.  We were seated near the server station and throughout the entire meal listened to our waiter as well as the other servers complain about tables, tips, working at CPK, and other employees.  It made our dinner very difficult to enjoy and we will not be returning. Hopefully the CPK opening in cool springs will not have these problems.  Would not recommend this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville
Terry V.,"Nashville, TN",362,322,392,2.0,5/3/2015,"We came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and it took awhile for the hostess to get all the guests sorted and seated. We were the third party in line and had to wait longer than necessary. Once that was settled, we sat down and our waiter asked for our drink orders immediately. Thankfully we knew what we wanted- Iced tea and strawberry mango lemonades. I liked my lemonade- it's super tart but I love it that way. For our meal. We ordered the BBQ chicken salad and then the Hawaiian BBQ pizza. The food didn't take too long. I  love a good BBQ chicken pizza with pineapples and CPK missed the mark. Castrillo's has my vote hands down.  A few pieces of my chicken was fatty which I cannot stand and didn't taste good. I eat chicken A LOT and I felt that it was a low grade chicken. The presentation of the pizza itself wasn't appetizing and I couldn't believe they left the onion slices as round instead of diced that would be much easier to eat. I wish they would have put more pineapples on the pizza. Actually, I wish the pizza would have been more flavorful with fresher ingredients. I was very disappointed in my pizza.   Our waiter was OK and needs more training on how to properly close out customers. We declined on desserts and I thought it was odd when he returned with two checks. He didn't ask us prior to bringing the checks and just assumed that we were separate. Just take a second to ask if the bill will be one or split. I felt rushed to leave even though I wasn't finished with my lemonade.  I definitely won't be back when there are a ton of other pizza options here in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville
Megan W.,"Nashville, TN",10,87,69,5.0,1/24/2013,"I'll be really upfront with you in my review of this place. I loved the atmosphere, the hostess was nice, our waiter was on par with service, and the food was good--not the best pizza I've ever had, but it was good. To try and be a bit adventurous, I got one of their appetizers, something with pork dumplings and ginger chili sauce (or something along those lines...) and that was actually very tasty. I ordered their BBQ chicken pizza and asked the waiter to leave off the cheese (all my lactose free buddies say 'holla!!'). After ordering, the manager (I'm assuming) came over before the food came out to ask me about my order; she said I'd requested no cheese and wanted to make sure I meant no cheese at all, not just the mozzerella on top. I said yes, I'm lactose-free, so she informed me that our waiter hadn't asked for the gouda to be taken off and that they were making me another pizza right at that moment, but they'd go ahead and bring the other one out since they'd already made it and they'd take that pizza off of the ticket (I think...) HEY. AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE AWARD THERE. The pizza was okay, not the best BBQ Chicken pizza I've had, but that type of customer service gets this place 5 stars in my book all day long.

Kaitlyn K.,"Franklin, TN",131,98,45,3.0,5/8/2011,"The Spinach Artichoke Dip and Hummus are great starters.  The BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad and the Thin Crust Pizzas are my favorites here.  The soups are also delish - especially the Tortilla.  The Key Lime Pie is also very good to close the meal.    If you want a drink, be prepared to spend $4.75 on a beer, and $10 for a well drink.  I recommend their iced tea.  (UNsweet.)  ;)  My gripe with this place is...the prices over the last few years have gone up TREMENDOUSLY!  It used to be a place for a relatively inexpensive to average priced date...now, we're lucky if we escape for less than $50 + tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville?start=40

I then ordered a thin crust half Jerk Chicken and half Habanero. Service was exceptional, I believe his name was Jason. If he is your server you will be glad.

Kristina L.,"Hermitage, TN",130,160,83,2.0,5/15/2013,"A few days ago I ordered three items online for a business meeting.  I placed the order around 10:30a with a request for an 11:45a pick up time.  I arrived at 11:45 for my pick up and called to let them know I was curbside.  I was told they were ""running behind"" and it would be another ten minutes.  Okay, I can deal with that since they told me a time.  Ten minutes pass, then fifteen minutes pass.  Finally, after twenty minutes have passed, I call again.  The person on the other end of the phone tells me it has ""only been five minutes"" since I last called.  Not so...  There's this handy little thing called an iPhone that actually lets you know what time you placed an outgoing call.  My calls were placed twenty minutes apart.  Finally, after waiting an additional five minutes (I'd almost been there for half an hour) a manager delivers my food with the apology that they were overwhelmed that day and not prepared for so many online orders.   So I get back to the office and deliver lunch.  Lo and behold, the order I waited all that time for was missing an item.  I immediately call and tell them.  I also explain that after all the waiting I've been through that I expect this to be delivered in the next few minutes.  To their credit, it was delivered within fifteen minutes.  However, the only apology made this time was to credit my credit card for the missing item.   Overall, I was very displeased with the wait time, the attitude of the person on the phone and their online ordering system.  If the system is overloaded, why does it allow for me to select a pick up time?  I selected a time a full hour and fifteen minutes later for three items and still wound up waiting for an additional half an hour for 2/3 of my order.  I used to order business lunches there frequently, but after this I will be rethinking about where to take my business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville?start=40
Leslie P.,"Nashville, TN",105,144,97,4.0,7/16/2011,"I had very high expectations for the California Pizza Kitchen and the location in Green Hills definitely met those expectations.  Every pizza joint I go to, I always make a point to try their version of the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  A-MAZING! We also ordered the Jamaican Jerk Chicken, Traditional Cheese, and the Chipotle Chicken pizzas.  Each pizza looked so great, that we found ourselves dipping into each other's pizza.  They were all delicious.   The service was wonderful as well!  Our server was very accomodating, and knew her stuff about what beers and drinks went best with each pizza.  The only thing I'll say that is a negative is their ""Small Craving"" plates are very small.  We ordered the White Corn Guacamole with chips and while it was very fresh, it was not enough for the table of four like we thought.  It's more like a spoon full of guacamole and we felt jipped out of $9.

Ally E.,"Killeen, TX",7,26,13,1.0,9/16/2012,"My disgusting experience that I had with some friends at CPK in Nashville (Hillsboro Pike) on Saturday, September 15, 2012.   I guess we didn't see the red flags, but it started from the time we walked in the door. We waited 7 minutes to be seated. I know this exact time, because I received a phone call as we walked in, so I excused myself and came in after that. That call was 7 minutes and 42 seconds. My party was still standing at the hosteess station. The restaurant was not half full. It appeared to be a slow night. There was no hostess or greeter on hand. We were asked had we been helped, and were finally seated by our server. I went directly to the restroom. Upon returning to the table within a few moments, drinks were being brought to the table. I immediately asked, ""Don't you all wait until all parties are at the table before taking orders. "" Our server, simply stated sorry. I ordered a strawberry lemonade as did the rest of my party. I was then informed, ""It may take a while, since we just ran out of lemonade"" so I ordered a sweet tea and water. We all placed our orders and waited patiently. We sat chatting amongst ourselves and drinking our drinks. Our server came and brought refills of water, to 2 of the 4 glasses at the table, while our lemonades and sweet teas were not refilled. Our food came, still no refills. At this point, I'm thinking did they run out of sweet tea as well? Finally I asked can I have a refill to either my water or sweet tea. Both of my glasses had ice only at this time. So I was given a refill of water. WOW!! Finally after waiting long enough I asked another server to ask my server for a sweet tea refill. Our food came, and I immediately asked for extra parmesan and croutons. A male server brought me croutons and dressing. The most upsetting part was the MOUSE that ran across the floor. At this point we asked for checks and were ready to go. While we sat there, my husband drank a sip of his water, and said it's time to go now in an upset voice. I asked him what's wrong, and he showed us a dead fly floating in his water!!  As we walked out a CPK employee said thanks for coming, hope you enjoyed dinner and the show in a joking voice. This was a very upsetting experience. I don't see anything funny about it. Seeing a 4 legged critter race across the room while you are eating and the dead fly in a drink, plus the lack of service makes me never want to step foot in this restaurant again. Whether $5 or the $46.43 that we spent, I am a paying customer and expect better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville?start=40

CPK has a wonderful spin on traditional pizza and their non-traditional pizzas are an experience all in themselves. I have had the BBQ Chicken, Garlic Chicken, the Mushroom Pizza and their 5 Cheese n Tomato. All of them are really tasty and worth having again. Recently they changed their menue and though they kept many of my favorites, they dropped 1 or two of my favorite pizzas as well as the mushroom ravioli. This can be forgiven though as their quality has improved with this menu change.

Wayne H.,"Sunnyvale, CA",13,116,56,3.0,8/1/2011,"Despite being a native Californian myself, I have never tried this place before coming to Nashville and I now have to say, while this place is a fair introduction to Californian food, it is expensive as heck, and these days you can find comparably unique and interesting pizzas elsewhere (including the frozen aisle of your local supermarket). California Pizza Kitchen is famed as the inventor of the BBQ chicken Pizza. That pizza is well done, the BBQ sauce slightly sweet but not overwhelmingly so, and the red onions adding a bit of kick to the slices.  Still, it's not too different from other places that sell BBQ chicken pizza these days such as Boscos. The restaurant does have a wide variety of pizzas to choose from, ranging from Classical and Hawaiian to a Jamaican Jerk and Pear and Gorgonzola Pizza.  The Wild Mushroom pizza did impress me with its deep savory flavors coming from the four different types of mushrooms. Personal pizzas are a somewhat eye-opening $11-$15 dollars for around a 10"" diameter plate.  For those not interested in pizzas (why are you here?) there is also an extensive list of pastas, salads and other dishes, which may be done gluten-free.  CPK's wide variety of veggie options was also greatly appreciated by my vegetarian friend.  These also range from $8-$15. In conclusion, I guess if you've wanted to experience ""California cuisine"" or have a taste for some more exotic pizza selections (and aren't cheap like me), this is a nice place to go.  Still,  I'd just as likely go to one of our local restaurants like Boscos or Wild Cow instead-the cuisine of my home state is more pervasive in Tennessee than you think.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville?start=40

We happened to go on a very busy night because of a promotion they have right now, but we received our orders in a decent amount of time.   I've tried two pizzas now that are outside the 'norm' of pizzas for me. They weren't 'to die for' pizzas, but the cool thing about California Pizza Kitchen is that if you don't find the best pizza ever on one visit, then there's several others to try.   Definitely an awesome place to go if you're bored with pepperoni or the regular pizza toppings.  However, I still can't make myself like lettuce on any pizza.  Oh, and definitely sit at the bar at least once if you're a fan of watching how things are made. It most certainly added to the whole experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville?start=40

Sure you can't get 43 different themed pizzas but the ones they have are tremendous. This is just good and it will always be consistent.  With that said, their ambiance is kind of fun with the diner vibe so I could see the appeal there. I also will say the service is always very good which is worthy of the star.

It didn't take a long time to get food, drinks, etc. but it wasn't snappy either.  I found the pizza to be mediocre, unique but not special. We tried their avocado rolls, which were weird. They are basically southwestern egg rolls but with chicken, bacon and avocado that you dip in ranch. We ate them all, but I don't think I'd order again.

I want to go back and try some more, although I did get a chance to try some of my friend's pizzas.

I guess you won't be trading pizza slices""). # 3. Decent portion sizes. I don't feel like they are trying to feed the small nation that I have apparently hidden under the table, but I don't leave hungry, either. #4. Fresh and tasty food. I ordered the gluten-free pepperoni pizza. While no gluten-free pizza will ever be quite as delightful as gluten-plus pizza, this was hot, crispy, and tasted a lot like pizza. Can't argue with that. For people who prefer to be unhappy, there are also quinoa salads and other vaguely healthy options.

To be fair, everyone has bad days.  Perhaps Man Bun's man bun was just pulled a little too tightly.  Maybe he was running low on hair ties?  Maybe his PBR had gotten warm in the kitchen?  Who knows, but I don't think I'll be back.  tl;dr: CPK giving bad service before giving bad service was cool.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville

Neglected to refill beverage glasses for a long while, never bothered to provide plates for appetizer, and the general attitude amongst the staff was just careless and annoyed.

I ended up not being adventurous and just choosing the Pepperoni pizza. Though it was simple, it was delicious!

Terry V.,"Nashville, United States",362,322,392,2.0,3/5/2015,"We came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and it took awhile for the hostess to get all the guests sorted and seated. We were the third party in line and had to wait longer than necessary. Once that was settled, we sat down and our waiter asked for our drink orders immediately. Thankfully we knew what we wanted- Iced tea and strawberry mango lemonades. I liked my lemonade- it's super tart but I love it that way. For our meal. We ordered the BBQ chicken salad and then the Hawaiian BBQ pizza. The food didn't take too long. I  love a good BBQ chicken pizza with pineapples and CPK missed the mark. Castrillo's has my vote hands down.  A few pieces of my chicken was fatty which I cannot stand and didn't taste good. I eat chicken A LOT and I felt that it was a low grade chicken. The presentation of the pizza itself wasn't appetizing and I couldn't believe they left the onion slices as round instead of diced that would be much easier to eat. I wish they would have put more pineapples on the pizza. Actually, I wish the pizza would have been more flavorful with fresher ingredients. I was very disappointed in my pizza.   Our waiter was OK and needs more training on how to properly close out customers. We declined on desserts and I thought it was odd when he returned with two checks. He didn't ask us prior to bringing the checks and just assumed that we were separate. Just take a second to ask if the bill will be one or split. I felt rushed to leave even though I wasn't finished with my lemonade.

Heather R.,"Nashville, United States",45,50,,4.0,9/3/2015,"When the blizzard of '15 hit, CPK didn't fail to disappoint, merely by being open.  So, pro #1: Opens when it snows. Not a positive to be taken lightly in Nashville. Other positives: # 2. Delicious gluten-free pizza, complete with a little wooden gluten-free flag of isolation (""Oh. I guess you won't be trading pizza slices""). # 3. Decent portion sizes. I don't feel like they are trying to feed the small nation that I have apparently hidden under the table, but I don't leave hungry, either. #4. Fresh and tasty food. I ordered the gluten-free pepperoni pizza. While no gluten-free pizza will ever be quite as delightful as gluten-plus pizza, this was hot, crispy, and tasted a lot like pizza. Can't argue with that. For people who prefer to be unhappy, there are also quinoa salads and other vaguely healthy options.

But the place was too expensive.  I wasn't surprised but I was disappointed.  The $12.50 for a small pizza and the $9.50 for a salad with cold cuts all came off as priced twice as high as it should be. And they were a little too zealous in up-selling.  Did not like that at all, and my wife totally fell for it.  If you dig California-style pizza, and have money to burn, then this is probably pretty good, but I'd rather eat second-rate Little Caesars, and not feel cheated.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville?start=20

I loved the atmosphere, the hostess was nice, our waiter was on par with service, and the food was good--not the best pizza I've ever had, but it was good. To try and be a bit adventurous, I got one of their appetizers, something with pork dumplings and ginger chili sauce (or something along those lines...) and that was actually very tasty. I ordered their BBQ chicken pizza and asked the waiter to leave off the cheese (all my lactose free buddies say 'holla!!'). After ordering, the manager (I'm assuming) came over before the food came out to ask me about my order; she said I'd requested no cheese and wanted to make sure I meant no cheese at all, not just the mozzerella on top. I said yes, I'm lactose-free, so she informed me that our waiter hadn't asked for the gouda to be taken off and that they were making me another pizza right at that moment, but they'd go ahead and bring the other one out since they'd already made it and they'd take that pizza off of the ticket (I think...)

We waited 7 minutes to be seated. I know this exact time, because I received a phone call as we walked in, so I excused myself and came in after that. That call was 7 minutes and 42 seconds. My party was still standing at the hosteess station. The restaurant was not half full. It appeared to be a slow night. There was no hostess or greeter on hand. We were asked had we been helped, and were finally seated by our server. I went directly to the restroom. Upon returning to the table within a few moments, drinks were being brought to the table. I immediately asked, ""Don't you all wait until all parties are at the table before taking orders. "" Our server, simply stated sorry. I ordered a strawberry lemonade as did the rest of my party. I was then informed, ""It may take a while, since we just ran out of lemonade"" so I ordered a sweet tea and water. We all placed our orders and waited patiently. We sat chatting amongst ourselves and drinking our drinks. Our server came and brought refills of water, to 2 of the 4 glasses at the table, while our lemonades and sweet teas were not refilled. Our food came, still no refills. At this point, I'm thinking did they run out of sweet tea as well? Finally I asked can I have a refill to either my water or sweet tea. Both of my glasses had ice only at this time. So I was given a refill of water. WOW!! Finally after waiting long enough I asked another server to ask my server for a sweet tea refill. Our food came, and I immediately asked for extra parmesan and croutons. A male server brought me croutons and dressing. The most upsetting part was the MOUSE that ran across the floor. At this point we asked for checks and were ready to go. While we sat there, my husband drank a sip of his water, and said it's time to go now in an upset voice. I asked him what's wrong, and he showed us a dead fly floating in his water!!  As we walked out a CPK employee said thanks for coming, hope you enjoyed dinner and the show in a joking voice. This was a very upsetting experience. I don't see anything funny about it. Seeing a 4 legged critter race across the room while you are eating and the dead fly in a drink, plus the lack of service makes me never want to step foot in this restaurant again.

Lashona M.,"Fayetteville, United States",102,312,25,4.0,20/11/2010,Very good pizza whether out of the freeze section OR the restaurant! lol  I tried the four season pizza without the meat and it was just right!

Lorenzo K.,"Murfreesboro, United States",10,15,1,3.0,2/1/2015,Pizza is not the best. Pretty dry. But the butter cake is the best dessert I have ever had. No joke. My family came here full of Vietnamese food and we still scarfed down 2 butter cakes between 4 people as if we haven't eaten dinner.

Wayne H.,"Sunnyvale, United States",13,116,56,3.0,1/8/2011,"Despite being a native Californian myself, I have never tried this place before coming to Nashville and I now have to say, while this place is a fair introduction to Californian food, it is expensive as heck, and these days you can find comparably unique and interesting pizzas elsewhere (including the frozen aisle of your local supermarket). California Pizza Kitchen is famed as the inventor of the BBQ chicken Pizza. That pizza is well done, the BBQ sauce slightly sweet but not overwhelmingly so, and the red onions adding a bit of kick to the slices.  Still, it's not too different from other places that sell BBQ chicken pizza these days such as Boscos. The restaurant does have a wide variety of pizzas to choose from, ranging from Classical and Hawaiian to a Jamaican Jerk and Pear and Gorgonzola Pizza.  The Wild Mushroom pizza did impress me with its deep savory flavors coming from the four different types of mushrooms. Personal pizzas are a somewhat eye-opening $11-$15 dollars for around a 10"" diameter plate.  For those not interested in pizzas (why are you here?) there is also an extensive list of pastas, salads and other dishes, which may be done gluten-free.  CPK's wide variety of veggie options was also greatly appreciated by my vegetarian friend.  These also range from $8-$15. In conclusion, I guess if you've wanted to experience ""California cuisine"" or have a taste for some more exotic pizza selections (and aren't cheap like me), this is a nice place to go.  Still,  I'd just as likely go to one of our local restaurants like Boscos or Wild Cow instead-the cuisine of my home state is more pervasive in Tennessee than you think.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville?start=40
Kaleena 'Kala' H.,"Nashville, United States",35,152,,5.0,19/7/2011,"Although I do eat the pizzas that they sell at the grocery store, going to the actual restaurant is always an amazing experience. Their food is delicious and the service is always excellent! Some of my favorite foods include the 4-cheese pizza, the BBQ Chicken pizza, and their garlic fettuccine alfredo with chicken...all very delicious. Just recently I also tried their hot fudge sundae on a whim, and it was awesome. :D I also like how they offer healthy options, such as thin-crust or gluten free options, along with multi-grain pasta. Next time I go, I hope to try their new Small Bites selections...mainly the Crispy Mac and Cheese ones. I have heard they are delicious and it makes my mouth water! :D",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville?start=40
Jennifer P.,"Nashville, United States",26,175,19,4.0,17/10/2012,"Enjoyed the pear and Gorgonzola pizza...looks a little weird to have a salad ON TOP of a pizza but it is tasty.  The avocado BLT egg roll appetizer was a unique bite that we enjoyed sharing too.  A little slow on the drink refills, but overall a very nice experience with a large group.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville?start=40
Matthew S.,"Nashville, United States",556,30,93,3.0,27/12/2011,"For what you get, this place is dreadfully overpriced.  The best pizza we got was the white pizza, and the orig chop salad was nice but not worth thirteen bucks.  It's a nice place but has an overinflated view of itself.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville?start=40

Christopher M.,"San Francisco, United States",2,45,,1.0,27/4/2010,"Abysmal. Both me and the person I was with agreed it was one of the worst meals we've had in Nashville. The pizza tastes EXACTLY like the frozen CPK pizzas you can find in your neighborhood grocery store. Which, for frozen pizza, is pretty good. But not when you are actually paying $12 for it in the restaurant. The ambience of this place just doesn't sit right with me either. It's just overall not a good place to eat for any occasion. It was about 8pm on a Saturday night and it was maybe 20% full. I wonder why...",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville?start=40

Tonya O.,"Nashville, United States",64,219,153,4.0,24/6/2009,"I've been to the restaurant twice now, and both have been good experiences. The first time I was there, the server was almost too professional, but the second time the server was very personable and made the experience much more laid back. We happened to go on a very busy night because of a promotion they have right now, but we received our orders in a decent amount of time.   I've tried two pizzas now that are outside the 'norm' of pizzas for me. They weren't 'to die for' pizzas, but the cool thing about California Pizza Kitchen is that if you don't find the best pizza ever on one visit, then there's several others to try.   Definitely an awesome place to go if you're bored with pepperoni or the regular pizza toppings.  However, I still can't make myself like lettuce on any pizza.  Oh, and definitely sit at the bar at least once if you're a fan of watching how things are made. It most certainly added to the whole experience.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville?start=40

Heather H.,"Stuttgart, Germany",44,439,107,4.0,8/7/2008,"My husband and I were on a Sunday afternoon mission to find spicy ethnic food to battle our head colds, and finding nothing, gave up and stopped at CPK. Much to our surprise, we were able to get just that, and a great waiter. We ordered spicy approximated Asian dishes (ie, ""Thai Linguine,"" pad thai with Italian noodles.) and bloody marys. Our waiter sensed this theme and scoured around for a dish of chili paste which helped immensely.  Everything tasted awesome, and the service was quick.

Cherie M.,"Antioch, United States",0,16,1,2.0,10/6/2014,"The food is good that is my only reason for returning. Sometimes I can get a bartender to make a good mojito. The customer service is the worst even from management. You walk in and you may or may not be greated. IF  walkbin for takeout forget about it. Today I was in for takeout. I stood at the counter for 10 min before a random waiter asked me if I had been helped when I said no he let me know je couldnt but would find the girl that could. Finally the manager walks over but only to gather receipts that are printing,he does not ask if I need help until I set my phone on the counter with the timer on. After he takes order he says 15 min so I decide to buy one of their over priced drinks after 30 mins I ask if my food is ready instead of the rude as manager bringing me my food its been sitting over on the take out counter. I have eaten CPK for years its been in the last few cities I have lived in but this is my last straw with this place.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville?start=60
Anna A.,"Nashville, United States",184,251,3,3.0,7/1/2009,"Ahhh, I could take it or leave it. I've been a few times and I just think it should taste better than it does. The menu is exciting and there are tons of things to pick from BUT I don't know it just ends up being make me close my eyes and moan good. I mean it's not the rip off that say Cheesecake factory is but still there are plenty of mom and pop places in Nashville that are way better that use fresh vegetables and such. Sure you can't get 43 different themed pizzas but the ones they have are tremendous. This is just good and it will always be consistent.  With that said, their ambiance is kind of fun with the diner vibe so I could see the appeal there. I also will say the service is always very good which is worthy of the star. So one star for the service, one star for the diner vibe, one star for the pizza, and what you have is a good restaurant.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville?start=60
Erin D.,"Nashville, United States",24,325,60,3.0,6/2/2009,"So I finally tried this place last night. I was really surprised on a Thursday night at 6:30 that I was able to get seated immediately (party of two of course). The waitstaff seemed to have their hands full though. It didn't take a long time to get food, drinks, etc. but it wasn't snappy either.  I found the pizza to be mediocre, unique but not special. We tried their avocado rolls, which were weird. They are basically southwestern egg rolls but with chicken, bacon and avocado that you dip in ranch. We ate them all, but I don't think I'd order again. I also got the half BBQ chicken salad and it was so covered in dressing you couldn't taste the lettuce. It was weird.  I don't know if I'll go back - we spent 40 bucks on two ppl, which is a bit much in my opinion.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville?start=60

I tried the Jamaican Jerk pizza and it was very tasty. The most difficult thing was choosing a pizza from the many choices. I want to go back and try some more, although I did get a chance to try some of my friend's pizzas. The individual pizzas are big enough to eat some and then have enough to take home and heat up the next day (I thought it tasted even better the next day). It is nice to eat a good gourmet pizza and have a nice glass of wine in a good surrounding with good service.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville?start=60

Lots of booth and counter space. It has cocktails, but not a loafer's lounge type of bar feel. The food is fresh and you can actually eat a pizza without feeling guilty. There are several choices of pizzas that aren't greasy American style corporate pizza...and they have real fresh vegetables on them.
