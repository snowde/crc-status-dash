Mark C.,"Gardner, MA",0,5,,2.0,7/12/2016,"Well... I've only been there twice, and the first time was decent (maybe 3 stars) but the 2nd time (less than 1 star) ensures I'll never return. Overall, I'll give them 2 stars because it can be hit or miss apparently.       My wife ordered a chicken dish. When the food came out it looked great, until she bit into it. The bottom side of the chicken was burned pretty badly. Even for someone like me, who likes a little char, this tasted bad.   Upon inspection, each piece was burned on the bottom. Meaning THEY KNEW it was burned, yet served it anyway with the ""good side"" facing out. Did they think we wouldn't notice?!      We waited a few minutes for the waitress to come over and check on things, like they are supposed to. She made eye contact with us, and most definitely knew my wife wasn't eating, but didn't come over. Our drinks were running empty and I had eaten two slices of the pizza I ordered by then. I actually had to flag the waitress down to get her to come over.      The waitress showed up and didn't even apologize.  She didn't even offer a new plate until my wife asked. Like we were just showing her burned food for fun or something. After a pause, she told us she'd get a new one in, and left. Normally I don't dock tip money for this, as the waitresses don't cook the food. However, this waitress knew we had an issue and ignored us, then didn't remove the food from the table, leaving my hungry wife to munch on arugula and cheese with this food sitting in front of her.  I could have shared my pizza, but my wife doesn't do spicy.  The waitress went from my standard 20 to 15(should have gone lower), and still didn't refill our drinks.       Onto the drinks! I noticed my glass was cracked 90% around the center. While waiting for the waitress, some man with an ear piece came over to check my wife's food. I assume he was the manager, but he never introduced himself, so who knows. He apogized for the food and finally took the plate. This is when I brought the glass to his attention. He picked up the glass and said, ""interesting"" and took it away. I was still eating my pizza and NEVER got a refill. I paid for that drink...  Even when the waitress brought the 2nd plate out, she still didn't offer a refill. We had to ask, and STILL only got 1.     Finally, my pizza. I ordered a ""crispy"" thin crust. It was good... but the crust wasn't fully cooked. I could tell because it was chewy. So much so, with each bite, I had to grip the pizza with my off hand and pull. Pizza, let alone crispy crust pizza, shouldn't need that kind of attention.  I ate it though, because I'm not super picky and like I said, it tasted good.      When all was said and done, we only got 8 dollars off our order. Half of what my wife's meal cost. I'm not cheap, so I didn't fight for more as easy as it would have been.  Also, my tip was 15 percent of the bill before the discount.       I don't like giving bad reviews, as I'm not a complainer. However, the only things that were brought to the staffs attention were the burned food and broken glass. I feel like our experience needed to be publicized as it was the worst restaurant experience I've had in a LONG time.       OH!! Almost forgot the green gunk stuck to one of the forks. We had 3, but my son didn't need it, so we got lucky... but that was a thing as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick?start=20
Ash J.,"Quincy, MA",2,27,,1.0,2/15/2016,"I had to change my order 3 times because I was asking for modifications (like no meat or pork), but it was not possible because the food was ""pre-prepared"". Never a good sign. But, that is not why I am giving this place a 1 start rating. One of the managers in this place (the older guy with grey hair) gives a new understanding of bad service and being completely heartless! We have a baby and we go out often. We always put the baby seat on the highchair by putting the highchair upside down (the high-chair has a wider base so we are able to place the baby seat on top of it) and safely securing the baby seat on it. Completely safe and stable, we would never jeopardize the safety of our baby- we have one of those expensive baby chairs that have extensions to be placed on highchairs in this manner.  The manager interrupted our meal and took the high-chair away because he said ""it's for insurance reasons"", although both the highchair and baby seat were very stable and secure. He came back with this flimsy cradle thing and asked us to put the baby chair on it. It was simply too dangerous, he saw that it was too unstable and too dangerous to place a baby seat on it. I told him this is not safe, and he simply ignored me and didn't even look me in the face. He saw that we no longer had a place to put the baby seat anywhere. He was not concerned with the safety of our baby, he failed to provide us with an adequate solution (in fact his solution was potentially very dangerous), he didn't apologize and he just treated us with utmost coldheartedness.. walked away as we had our baby on the dining table!  We were so upset we just got up and didn't finish our meal. He still didn't care. Shameful. Horrible ""pre-prepared"" food and worse service,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick?start=20
Jesse D.,"Caribou, ME",95,345,149,3.0,1/17/2016,The problem I face when I go to California Pizza Kitchen is I never know what I want to order. I can't for the life of me remember what I got the first time I went but most recently I had the pesto creme penne with chicken. It certainly wasn't bad but definitely isn't something I would be compelled to try again so I'll once again need to figure out what to get next time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick?start=20
Alex S.,"Needham Heights, MA",0,46,,3.0,6/10/2016,"I want to give this place more stars but we had an issue last time where it took the server FOUR tries to get us clean plates.  They had visible food marks on them and you just can't expect people to be okay with it.  I usually don't pay too much attention to this type of stuff but it became quite uncomfortable constantly having to ask them to get us clean plates. Having said that (and giving them the benefit of the doubt that it was a one-time issue), the food here is pretty good.  I like southwest egg rolls and they have good soups, pretty decent drinks too. The specialty, as you guessed it, is pizza, which is good but not mind blowing.  I did get one with avocado once and the avocado was RAW, like a raw potato raw, not good.  What bothered me is when you cut an avocado you KNOW it's raw and then they chose to serve it anyway  But that's the only time I had a food/taste related issue there.   Provided there are no problems, you should be able to get a decent bite to eat there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick?start=20
Vanna M.,"Ashland, MA",0,45,,3.0,6/27/2016,I wanted to rate a 2 because of the waitress but I know you might get someone else so I will let them have that. We had the misfortune to get Janine as our waitress. Quite possibly the worst waitress ever. I am in food service and I would never treat any of my customers so badly. We tipped nonetheless. The food was o.k. The mac and cheese app was tasteless. The spinach dip was meh. The pizzas were good. Their lemonade is on the sour side. The place was not very well run on this occasion. They had a big party I guess they were not prepared. Still is not an excuse for our waitress to be so rude.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick?start=20

Barbara A.,"East Watertown, MA",519,548,250,3.0,1/14/2013,"I have a problem eater -- sensory issues -- so if I can get him to eat out and eat well, I will.  We found ourselves at the Natick Mall using the gift cards family members gave the kids and found ourselves here. I have not been in a while and I gotta say I enjoyed it.  I got the wedge salad -- I know in the past I have dissed the wedge salad but I have come to enjoy a good one and they do a decent job of it here (just without the boiled egg - not a fan). My oldest and I split the pepperoni pizza and the problem eater got the kid's cheese (without tomato sauce, naturally).  He ate that cheese pizza so fast, I was almost convinced they did not bring it.  So clearly he is a fan.  I enjoyed the pepperoni - the pizza dough is a little sweet but I have had worse pizza.

Gregory S.,"Wayland, MA",0,36,3,4.0,10/21/2015,"I was surprised: knowing that this is a chain, I assumed that the food would be soul-less, franchise food. But I had the kung pao spaghetti (very california!) and it was actually quite tasty. Tasty deserts and pretty good soups. It is relatively a bit expensive, but considering it is in the Natick Mall, the price is probably to be expected. I can't say that I will come often, but the few times that I've come, it is usually quite enjoyable. A sort of California style of creative fusion of different cuisines, done well, even if they do seem to take themselves a bit too seriously, and are a franchise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick?start=20
Laura J.,"Framingham, MA",3,8,2,4.0,1/5/2015,"My husband and I came here on a Sunday night to grab a quick bite. Normally I wouldn't come here considering all the great restaurants in the area but I did not want to deal with the Cheesecake crowd or traffic and was pleasantly surprise. Our server, I think his name was Travers (?) was so sweet, kind and genuine. I probably wouldn't be writing this review if it was not for his great service.  We started with chips and guac which was nice and spicy but only okay. I also got a cup of the farmers soup - the portion was more like a bowl which made it nice for sharing. It was super hot too which I always appreciate. We then shared a margherita pizza which was nice and thin with fresh torn basil. This place is nice, warm and relaxing for a mall restaurant and from our experience the service was fantastic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick?start=20
Eunice E.,"Baltimore, MD",321,503,69,2.0,4/2/2013,"While the food is good, the service leaves much to be desired... We walked in and were told that there would be a 25-minute wait; on a Saturday evening, that's expected, thus, tolerable. Fast forward 45 minutes. The host had called our name but then some goon claimed that it was his table; when we went up to ask if our name had been called, the host stayed silent while another person said, ""Oh, no I don't think so."" Once the latter had left to whisk some other people to their table, the host came back to us and said, ""Actually, your name WAS called, but someone else took it -- you'll be next."" Dot. Dot. Dot. Was the long wait and the lying worth it? Half of me says yes, because the food really is quite delicious (carnitas with habanero sauce on whole wheat... um, drool!), but the other (more dignified, less carnal) part of me says--quite indignantly--no. When you tell me a wait time, please be honest about it, and if it will take longer than you originally thought, please don't give away our place in line to the first buffoon who pushes his way over to you and claims he's another person just to get his people seated, and please--PLEASE--don't lie to us and say you didn't call our name.

We sat at the bar to order our meal and out waitress was legit on something... she took our order with a highlighter, and was stumbling to walk. She wasn't even helping the guy behind the bar who was doing everything. And after we said something, she came up to us and tried to confront us. It was the most uncomfortable thing ever. They handled it well, but they really should have taken her off the floor. Needless to say, it wasn't our best experience, but overall, this place is usually pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick?start=20
Rishabh G.,"Waltham, MA",18,101,33,5.0,3/19/2012,"This restaurant is a great place to grab some lunch during work or dinner on any night out. The decor of the restaurant is really spacious with a full open view of the kitchen. The staff their is very friendly and offer some great advice on what to get. Most of the drinks have free refills, which is great. The menu is filled with some great choices. My three favorites are the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine, BBQ chopped chicken salad, and the BBQ chicken pizza.  Lets start with the Fettuccine. It's amazing. The chicken is very juicy. The pasta is cooked thoroughly. The sauce is very delicious. It has roasted yellow and red peppers with a hint of lime. It's perfect a perfect dish to try on a warm day. The BBQ chopped chicken salad is great. Fresh lettuce, tomatoes, corn, avocado (extra $2 I believe), juicy chicken and lots more. The salad is dressed well and tastes very refreshing. The BBQ chicken pizza is honestly their best pizza. Crispy crust topped off with BBQ, juicy chicken, red onions, cilantro, and smoked Gouda. It's mouth watering. The portion sizes are really good for all of the dishes. I've also tried the Three Cheese ravioli, which was very simple, yet delicious. Their food tends be very filling and the prices are not that bad. Overall, I highly recommend this place. The food is good, the service is great and fast, and its well priced. Will definitely be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick?start=20
Georgina C.,"Boston, MA",382,227,27,5.0,2/5/2014,"I made a large order for the company I work at through Foodler. After checking with both the restaurant and the 3rd party delivery service to make sure they could accommodate the size and the timing of the order, I was confident everything would go well. Instead, the order was almost half an hour late (lunch was to be served during a presentation that was going on) and while the 3rd party delivery service blamed CPK and CPK told me they had the order ready in time, it was CPK that went above and beyond to remedy the situation. The manager (I believe his name is Tim) gave me a personal call and worked to make sure things got taken care of immediately and exceeded my expectations exponentially (and not to mention the food was delicious!) Because of the way management handled this snafu that was not their fault, I will continuously return to this location and order  from them (just scheduling delivery a half hour earlier.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick?start=20

Jessica L.,"Somerville, MA",15,78,10,4.0,1/13/2014,"I've been to California Pizza Kitchen twice, and both times, the food has been really good.  This time, I got shrimp scampi on their ""lighter"" menu.  It was a little bit on the blander side, but it was still very good.  I was surprised that it had less than 650 calories, because it was actually quite a big dish of food.  I had half of it and was already very incredibly full.  And, it came with a lot of shrimp!  I was surprised.   As for the value of the food in terms of price.  It's decent.  It's not the best deal that I've seen around, but it's also important to realize that this restaurant is in a mall...and, you pay for convenience (and they have to pay for rent).  I came here on a Sunday afternoon, and there were a bunch of kids.  It can get a little noisy at times, but I didn't feel that it detracted significantly from my dining experience.  Though, if you are coming here to catch up with friends, it is a little easy to get distracted by everything that's going on in the restaurant.    Would I come again?  Well, as this is the second time that I've been here, the answer is yes.  This isn't one of my favorite restaurants, but they do a good job and it's convenient.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick?start=20

E T.,"West Hollywood, CA",28,453,164,3.0,12/9/2017,"Nothing wring with this place. Nothing amazing. I hosted a business lunch at this place for 5 clients and was actually pretty surprised as large and upscale as the Natick Mall (oops sorry ... Collection! Eye roll) is, there is a lack of decent restaurants here. You'd think there would be a Steakhouse/seafood spot like McCormick and Scmitt or Capitol Grille. Met Bar sucks and isn't really good for business given the open concept. I will say that making a reservation here at CPK was not easy. I kept getting put on hold and shuffled around and ultimately when we showed up, nobody had our reservation down. Plus parking is a bitch and a half in December! The decor is surprisingly modern and classy for a pizza place. The set up is good for business as there are booths and tables which are fairly spread out so you can talk without being overheard by someone right on top of you. It's not noisy at all, even when crowded. The biggest takeaway is that the last thing you want to get here is the pizza. They are very small, kind of skimpy on the ingredients and sort of bland. We got 4 pizzas for 5 people ($50!) and after we were done eating them, we all kind of looked at each other like, 'are you still hungry?' so we ended up ordering sandwiches. Ha ha ($12-$15 each!) The sandwiches were the star of the show. Very big portion and all tasted fairly fresh and tasty. The pizza was like salty cardboard compared. They have an okay drink menu although the non alchoholic homemade sodas were great, made with fresh fruit. Wolfgang Puck created California Pizza Kitchen in the 80s back when pizza was just pizza with no creative toppings. He invented the BBQ chicken pizza and put shrimp on pizza which was very innovative for the time. He sold the concept years ago and it appears it was purchased by a corporation who cut costs on freshness and ingredients, so that's what you get today. Souless frozen pizza ... Stick with the sandwiches and burgers. All my stars are for atmosphere, service and the ease to do business here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick

I'm not a fan of sun-dried tomatoes in general so could do without those. It's a good salad but definitely not worth the price--when they say ""small plates,"" they mean it! Roasted Spinach and Artichoke Thin Crust Pizza (~$15 for a medium) Ordered with two sunny-side up eggs (extra $1). Incredibly tasty. It's basically garlic bread with spinach and artichokes--who could complain? I probably wouldn't order the eggs on a pizza again, though. While visually interesting and a way to get more protein for vegetarians, they were super messy with the thin crust. Also, they only cover two pieces of the pizza. The artichoke was my least favorite part--I'd prefer they use single leaves instead of chunks with multiple leaves as it's a lot of bitterness for one bite.

Finally, pizza comes but what we see looks like a over cooked store bought pizza with thrown on pineapple chunks. I asked the waiter if this was the Hawaiian pizza or mistake. He answered, no this is our Hawaiian pizza. Manager comes by and explains this is how they do it. I've had this pizza in other locations, I think they were just too busy to actually give a crap. Sent the pizza back. Asked for the check, paid for drinks and left.

Des C.,"Barrington, RI",94,268,18,2.0,7/26/2015,"Stopped I here after going to the American Girl Doll store, so yes I was already annoyed. We were seated quickly and the waitress came over within a minute or two. At our request she took our order immediately with our drink order.  The drinks came out quickly. However the waitress only stopped by once while we waited for our food. She refilled my drink, but everyone else at the table had to wait.  A table was sat about 15 minutes after us and they took forever to order. After she finalized their order she went to key it in and kind of milled around for a few minutes. Because of the open design we could see right into the kitchen. When she finally went into the kitchen she immediately grabbed our food. She brought the adult food prior to bringing the kid's (not a good move). When our food arrived it was just warm, it had obviously been sitting in the window for a while.

Jennifer M.,"Providence, RI",28,25,,5.0,7/30/2013,"I have just had my socks knocked off by a CHAIN. I am very pleasantly surprised. This review is coming to you courtesy of my having felt slightly cruddy all day and a) not feeling up to cooking dinner and b) not thinking my tummy could handle the rich goat cheese stuffed chicken I had planned for dinner. I told my boyfriend that what I really needed in my life was a good salad and we spent a bit of time pondering who in the very immediate area does a really good salad. I was dubious when he suggested CPK. But he linked me to the menu page where they describe their salad offerings, and I decided that a few things looked good, so it was worth a shot. I ordered the half portion of the roasted veggie salad and opted to have it topped with grilled shrimp. I could not BELIEVE how delicious and thoughtfully composed the salad was that I received. This was a plate heaped with roasted artichoke hearts, roasted red and yellow peppers, roasted eggplant, sun dried tomatoes, fresh asparagus, fresh avocado and char grilled corn. Each vegetable had a delicious flavor that brought something valuable to the flavor profile of the dish, and right when you needed a break from those flavors, the lettuce that all of this vegetable heaven was plated atop came to the party, dressed just enough with a bitingly acidic vinaigrette that counteracted the richness of the other vegetables nicely. And all of this is to say nothing of the shrimp!! There were 10 nicely grilled shrimp on my plate! The roasted veggie salad is a total slam dunk. My boyfriend ordered the petite wedge salad for an appetizer and had the carnitas tacos for dinner. He thought the wedge salad was out of this world, but characterized the tacos as a bit too rich, and slightly one note. If he hadn't asked for avocado on it (not the way it comes on the menu) it would have been just beef and lettuce in the taco. He did think the beef was well seasoned and cooked properly, but he did not think he would order the carnitas tacos again. Still, we were impressed with the food, and our server, Travis was very personable and polite.  I can't tell you how many times we have driven by this place choosing to go to one of the many other restaurants in the Natick Collection, and tonight we were kicking ourselves for not trying CPK sooner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick?start=40

This time I came with my cousin after shopping our hearts out at Natick Collection. We were hungry and wanted to avoid the food court, CPK seemed like a good choice. The place was a bit empty but there was still a 10-minute wait for a table. Our server, Jennifer was a doll! She was quick to offer meal choices as well as personal favorites.  I had the hot chocolate, which was soooo good. And the Chicken Club sandwich with asparagus soup. The soup was delicious, it looked at bit funny at first but after one spoon full I was sold! The club sandwich was also yummy, it even had fresh avocado. For me, the sandwich was pretty large and stacked high. For dessert we had the tiramisu, I don't have much of a sweet tooth but I enjoyed it. The portion was rather large, we shared it between the two of us and still had some left over.  I would definitely suggest ordering something other than pizza at CPK, I ventured out of my usual salad/pizza and had a great lunch!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick?start=40

Sneakers A.,"Framingham, MA",0,25,,2.0,2/26/2012,"Walking into CPK was like entering an alternate universe where there are no adults. Seemingly all of the employees and 75% of the diners here were teenagers. The mall-based location surely plays a role in attracting so many kids, but so does the ""lowest common denominator"" menu that at first glance seems eclectic and creative, but in execution is bland and sterile. It takes a cynical corporate culture to transform Thai, Mexican, and BBQ dishes all into a nonthreatening sameness that nobody alive could have a strong reaction to. This is the kind of restaurant that has a marketing department - not a chef - developing new dishes. Service was poor due to an unusually high diner to wait staff ratio.

Yes it is a chain but for a quick snack I'd rather eat a bite here than a bag of chips or some bad fries. There were three different kinds and I liked them all.

Robin Y.,"Boston, MA",144,315,421,1.0,3/17/2013,"I've been to this location four times and have consistently had the same issues, so I feel comfortable leaving a negative review. Problems: 1) Always crowded. This isn't their fault, because it is at the Natick Mall, but I feel like it's always important to anticipate having to wait for at least 20 minutes if you want to eat here. 2) Often, they will not have the item that you want to order. My fiancé once had to go through five different options to find something that was available that day that he wanted to order. Weird. 3) They make a lot of mistakes. Food is often undercooked, or they just totally ignore any requests for changes that you want to make to a dish. And sometimes if you send something back, it will be brought back to you in seemingly the same condition. I even ordered a dish here once that was totally different than the same one in Wellesley- and not in a good way. 4) If you have dietary restrictions, the waitstaff is totally useless- they don't really know what's in each dish, take forever to find out from the kitchen staff, and are snarky and unhelpful in their responses. If you can't eat gluten or dairy or anything of the sort, do not trust this restaurant- you will be endlessly frustrated and are better off finding somewhere else to go. 5) Nearly everyone who works here is standoffish and annoyed, including the management. If you have a problem, they will not handle it politely, which is the cherry on top of your meal after you wait a really long time to be seated, wait a long time for your fourth- or fifth-choice dish to be brought to you, and have to send it back multiple times before finally getting to eat a dish that's way too expensive considering the quality. I keep giving this place a chance because it's convenient when you're at the mall and they used to have several things that I liked, but they've all been taken off the menu. I didn't want to judge them based on one bad experience, but after several, it's safe to say that I won't be going back. Additionally, I've eaten a bunch of times at other locations in the area (Wellesley and Prudential Center) and have had awesome experiences- quick service, delicious food, and gracious waitstaff. I always leave this location frustrated and dissatisfied, and it isn't even that affordable. Summary: Avoid. Really- don't go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick?start=40

So last night we were in the collection (pinky raised) and as the mall was closing, wanted dinner for just the two of us, truly the rare treat. CPK was in the direction of the car and as weve never been officially, here we were.  we were seated quickly and our server was there pretty quick to take our drink order, which in this case was the ever so exciting diet pepsi (we wanted coke, no dice)  the menu is vast with many excellent sounding items, but really, i wanted pizza, made sense and all. we would never agree to the same specialty pizza, so i knew i was solo, i asked if they made individual pizzas, to which i was replied, all of the pizzas are individual, wow! 14 dollar indie pies huh?  I went for the world renown bbq chicken pizza sans red onion. mer asked for a cesar slad SOS (sauce on the side) and a foccia app that sounded too good to be true.  well, to be honest my pizza was fair, really it was just a pizza with bbq sauce instead of gravy, chicken and cheese, nothing you couldnt make at home, more than likely when the bread machine comes out again, i bet that just what im gonna do (well mers going to do, i cant cook anymore)  her salad came and the dressing was NOT on the side, but fortunately the amount used wasnt too horrid. also of note, the croutons they threw on were just bread pieces, nothing toasted or exciting in any way shape or form. the foccia app was also disappointment city. if you even been to john harvard, when you sit they give you bread, delightful, this was basically the same thing, but for appitizer cost. that erked us. it wasnt even hot, not exciting at all. this worried me as i thought she would eat my pizza, and although i shared some, this was my dinner. as she doesnt eat chicken, i figured that would have saved my snack for tomorrow too.  service was really horrid, besides the dressing request, refills took forever and they finally did  bring me a refill,it was the wrong thing.  the total cost was pricey too for really what amounts to a lot of bread, you know?  so in closing, cpk is not aok, im passing this joint from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick?start=40

Please tell me who the hell drinks diet coke with an orange? 10 min later we were able to order our appetizer, and thus came the next horror. We ASKED if the crabcake was big enough for two people-he said, yeah, it will fill you up..ummmmmm unless we are eating it for dessert maybe? The thing was puny and cold. Before we could order our entree, he left again. Finally, when we ordered, I don't happen to like asparagus, so I asked for a different side with my pasta..perhaps a different vegetable.

Alex B.,"Natick, MA",153,43,2,1.0,3/21/2013,"I don't know where to even begin here. But I will attempt to make something happen in this review. Lets start from the only good that I have encountered at this specific location, the bartender, Ramon, grade A service and made the best of what he could. I will note that I tipped him based on his performance rather than the performance of the people I will mention from here on in. Let the complaining begin, I would like to say the problems started when I ordered the food it took forever to come out, and I saw Ramon put it in to the computer. The when my food finally made it out my Jamaican Jerk Chicken Pizza was interesting the pizza it self was hot but the chicken was ice cold. What did I do? I sent it back, after Ramon noticed I was picking off pieces of chicken (about 10 minutes). it was put into the oven for about 10 minutes then given back to me (or so I was told). Chicken, yes, still cold. I did not want to send it back since the person I was out with already had time to finish their food. I ask for a manager, this girl was a riot, when I complained about the cold chicken and the health concerns over food that was served way below any legal temperature, she said ""trust me its cooked you can't get sick from it, so I don't know what your worried about"". Well apparently she missed a whole biology class in high school, some much needed common sense, and probably a food safety course.  Wow that night ended horribly, I was hungry and remained hungry for another two hours because I felt bad dragging someone into another restaurant so I decided that staying hungry might be a bit better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick?start=60

Mrs T.,"Brockton, MA",0,21,2,2.0,8/30/2015,"Went here on a Sunday. The bar was empty and the place wasn't too busy. I saw several employees sitting down eating. No big deal, they need breaks too while it's not so busy. Maybe they were mobbed earlier. There was nobody tending to the bar. Minutes pass by and someone stops eating and hands me a menu. I waited probably another 5 minutes and the person came back and took my order - an app and sangria. The sangria was excellent. I noticed the person sticking their fingers into a small plate and licking their fingers. It was the sugar used for rimming glasses!! Nasty. Secondly I noticed him cutting mint leaves- he put one in his mouth, chewed it a bit and spit it back out into his hand and threw it into the trash. He Never washed his hands. I'm saying this because it was quite ballsy to see someone do all of this out in the open. As for the food, it was decent which is too bad because I won't go back to this location. I don't expect perfection but I do expect some bit of professionalism and basic proper hygiene. I did still tip, not the 20% that I usually give though.

We were seated at a table that still had crumbs on it, the wine glasses on the table were disgusting and the person who finally finished cleaning the table (at our request) didn't even move items to wipe under them. After that, the rest of the service was equally under par. Our waiter was fine, but hardly up to the usual CPK standard.

Spenser O.,"Eugene, OR",8,100,,4.0,11/28/2010,"If I'm correct, this is the location at the Natick Collection, A mall I might not frequent but is there occasionally.     Anyway, The California Pizza Kitchen has an entrance from the mall as stated by other reviews, which is a lot easier than having to walk across a busy parking lot to get to a stand-alone location which seems to happen with every decent restaurant located near a mall.    I love the pizza here. Whether I get the four cheese or pepperoni it always is good. In addition to the pies mentioned they have quite a list of other varieties that will meet even the pickiest pie eaters standard.   And of course like most modern day restaurants they serve things like soup and salad.

V F.,"Frederick, MD",0,51,6,1.0,8/14/2012,"I have eaten here a few times and never had any problems.  It's an average CPK.  However, we tried curbside delivery tonight  and had a bad experience.  We had to be somewhere at 5 pm and were starving, so thought we'd order a pizza and pick it up on the way.  Online ordering was fast and easy and I received a confirmation email that pick up would be at 3:58 pm.  We pulled  up into the curbside parking spot and I called to let them know we were waiting.  I was told our pizza would be right out.  Then we proceeded to wait.  And wait some more.  Finally I called again and this time reached a different person who  again told me our pizza would be right out.  When I told him that we had been  told this 17 minutes ago, he asked if I had called when we first arrived.  Then he said he would check on the pizza and get back to me; he put me on hold, then came back and said there had been a shift change, but he would bring our pizza right out,  which he did do.  Of course, it was apparent that the pizza had just been sitting on the counter waiting to be delivered for over 15 minutes, getting cold.  After waiting so long, we didn't have time to take our cold, sad pizza back inside to wait for a fresh one.  A shift change is no excuse for such poor service.  CPK, we won't be back.  I suggest you avoid at least this location as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick?start=60

Ana R.,"Clinton, MA",167,507,103,2.0,11/17/2011,"I really really want to like CPK. Our office gets lunches catered all the time, and CPK (this location specifically) is one of the standards. But there's a lot left to be desired. Catering: A positive I will give them is that they rarely get an order incorrect. However, the timing is way off. These guys don't deliver, so when we show up to pick up a GIANT order (ordered one or more days in advance, always), it's kind of crazy that they are sometimes just STARTING to make the food. When I ask for a 11:45 pickup it's because lunch is starting at noon, and I want the food to be hot when it's set up. I don't want to get to CPK at 12:40, wait 20 minutes OR MORE to get my order, then have to drive out of the ridiculous parking lot and back to the office, to set up the lunch a half hour late. There's no reason for that.  Portions: catering portions are too small. Individual portions are too big.  Price: incredible that a salad with only veggies (no chicken, no salmon, no extras) comes to $14.18.  Quality: The Original BBQ Chicken Salad is boss, but it hardly qualifies as a salad. The Waldorf salad is by far the best thing I've ever eaten. The salads is where these guys excel, in my opinion. Ironically, the California Pizza Kitchen is not so great at making pizzas. Either they are burnt (although some char spots are reasonable when you're cooking with actual fire brick ovens), or the crusts are limp and not at all crunchy or chewy. Service: I think the last time I sat down at this CPK was over a year ago, so I'll refrain from specifics about waiter service. The only thing I remember was wanting a business lunch, and it took about 45 minutes for our food to come to the table. We ate in 5 minutes and hurried back to the office. When it comes to take out, they are great over the phone, make sure they have everything right but then drop the ball when it actually counts - getting the food from the kitchen over to you. The fact that everything comes in separate containers (avocado for the salad, chicken for the salad, croutons for the salad, veggies for the salad) makes packing up an order take forever and twice as long to unpack it! Especially if you don't know which packet is arugula for your pizza or wild greens for your salad. It's a build-your-own-salad kit, some assembly required, except they don't include instructions. Other: Today, I called in an order just for me. I was going out for lunch to run an errand and I called at 1:20pm to order a roasted veggie salad, no extras. Do I want iced tea? No. Do I want pumpkin cheesecake? No. Do I want chicken/shrimp/salmon? No.  The order I was read back was ""Full roasted veggie salad with chicken."" ""No chicken, please"" I say. ""Oh, ok, do you want an iced tea or pumpkin cheesecake?"" Um... again... no. Anyway, I was given a half hour wait time for a salad with no protein, and no extras. (WHY?) At 1:55pm, I arrived, paid $14.18 for my salad and waited as they assembled my take away order. Box of lettuce, box of veggies, bag of bread/butter.  I got back to my office, assembled my salad, ate for five minutes in ignorant bliss and then found a hair. The remainder of my $14 salad went into the trash. And the bread was spongy and bland.  sigh",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick?start=60

They have a reasonable selection of food - not every pasta dish is a creamy belt buster, many things have nice fresh ingredients. A tad overpriced ($11 for a moderate portion of pasta), but decent. Have had the Thai crunch salad, which was OK, but required LOTS of chewing to avoid getting stabbed in the mouth by the crunch (they weren't kidding). Chicken marsala was thin, marsala-less and skimpy. Sausage and pepper penne was almost all pepper, no sausage.
