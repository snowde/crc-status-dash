Renee D.,"Philadelphia, PA",56,145,555,4.0,7/31/2017,I wanted to take the time to update my review of CPK and call attention to their awesome customer service. In response to my previous review they reached out to me to discuss the situation and graciously invited me back.  I have since dined in once more and gotten take out three times. Each time service was excellent as was the food. I especially like the Kung Pao Spaghetti and The Jambalaya Pasta.  Thank you CPK for taking care of your customer. I am a fan more than ever now.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark

Q E.,"Washington, DC",1,10,30,3.0,6/10/2017,My husband and I normally go to the California Pizza Kitchen in MD but decided to venture to DE to do something different.  We always sit at the bar.  Today when we got to the bar this gentleman was busy pouring his friends drinks and wondering where the party was later that evening.  He didn't even approach us until 5 minutes later but when he did he felt irritated because he had to leave his conversation with his friends. He took our order but when our salads came out he didn't offer any cracked pepper or napkins.  I suggest to this location retrain your bartenders.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark
Rachel D.,"Dallas, TX",90,13,2,1.0,10/31/2017,"We came on a week night where we were among the only patrons and our food took an outrageous amount of time to come. Our kids food came out well ahead of ours but still long after we arrived. By the time our food came, our kids were done eating and ready to leave. Our waitress apologized saying that (even though we were the only guests there) no pizza dough had been prepared and it had to be made from scratch. That's inexcusable for a restaurant CALLED California PIZZA Kitchen. No compensation was made to rectify the situation. Even though our food took forever, there was no shortage of staff shooting the breeze and playing around. We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark
Joie W.,"Middle River, MD",37,11,11,3.0,6/25/2016,"Stopped in to grab a bite to eat before doing some retail therapy. It's right outside Christiana Mall and is your typical CPK-modern decor, bright & decent waitstaff.  I love their white sangria and was pleased to see that their summer special was a sangria flight-right up my alley! If you're into fruity, sweet drinks this is a winner. I was very pleased with all three servings, light, fresh & delish! As far as food I got the Asian chicken salad (my current fav there) and it was good as usual. My Husband tried the jambalaya fettuccine which I found rather bland. I'll take Friday's Cajun pasta over CPK's version hands down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark

I got the shaved mushroom pizza and half Mediterranean salad. The pizza was pretty decent but the salad was meh. It didn't seem that fresh. I would come back and try just the pizza.

Bruce K.,"Charlotte, NC",1416,8492,16632,4.0,1/14/2015,"You can make healthy choices at CPK, even if I didn't quite do that. And yes, it's a chain and I'm ashamed of myself for eating here. There. Do you feel better for accusing me of ""chain restaurant eating""? My excuse is that I was getting my 10k steps at the Christiana Mall during a freezing rain storm and I didn't really want to go drive somewhere else. :-) Very slow on a midweek night, I was Dan's only customer. It started off poorly, as they were out of the non-alcoholic beers on the drink menu and I ended up with a $2.69 glass of club soda. Yep, $2.69 for fizzy water. I started off with the chips and corn guacamole which was a nice appetizer. Not too big, not too much. Just enough to get your tummy running and ready for the main course. I wanted to try something different and not mainstream, but instead chose their famous barbecue chicken pizza. Very nicely cooked, very delicious combination of chicken, onions and some sort of smoked cheese. It still needed some red pepper flakes to kick up the heat, but otherwise was excellent. I can understand why these have been so successful for CPK. Wifi worked, but not perfectly. It was a little slow. I'm still a little bummed about the beer thing (and that they didn't comp my soda water) which is what dropped this from a perfect five star to just four.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark
Michael C.,"North Haven, CT",9,25,55,4.0,5/16/2015,"I love CPK. Eating at the bar was great on a busy night and the bartender was also a very a attentive server (Cody) unlike our waitress when we sat down to eat. He seemed to really enjoy his job. Food came out in a good order and he kept my drinks full.  At the bar they have always had a sports game on (baseball, basketball, etc.) and the free wifi keeps the kids busy.

Valerie S.,"Aston, PA",143,668,802,3.0,9/3/2014,"This was the first time I've eaten at this California Pizza Kitchen (Christiana Mall).  We weren't impressed with the service at this location at all... We waited about ten minutes for the waitress to take our drink orders, then had to wait another 3-4 minutes after our food came because they only one place setting available so they had to go search for three more!  So yeah, sitting there with food in front of us that we couldn't eat because we didn't have a fork.  Kind of a problem for our party of four. Then, had to wait yet again for the bill and to have our leftovers boxed up.  The food was really good, as it usually is at California Pizza Kitchen. We enjoyed the flatbread that we got, as well as the salads and pizza. Definitely a bit overpriced for what you get in my opinion, so it's a ""special treat"" kind of place for me.   This location seemed a good bit smaller than the one at the King of Prussia mall.  Next time I have a craving for California Pizza Kitchen, I'll probably just head to K of P...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark

Aurora G.,"Newark, DE",0,7,5,5.0,12/11/2016,I love this place. The thai crunch salad is fantastic! And I love that they encourage you try something new by allowing you to swap it for your favorite dish if you don't like the new dish as much. It's great for a lunch with the girls or dinner with the kids.

Morton F.,"New Castle, DE",83,922,3709,2.0,8/17/2011,"This California Pizza Kitchen is in the Christiana Mall, but the entrance faces the parking lot so you don't actually have to enter the mall to visit the restaurant. That said, I don't think it makes a difference because surprisingly, the restaurant closes earlier than the mall 4 days of the week! How does a restaurant build a nationwide chain based on serving up bland, uninteresting pizza at premium prices? I took a look at their menu and I didn't get any sense of value. The pizza I ordered turned out rather dull and bland. This is not California style. This is yet another chain restaurant trying to be edgy, not succeeding, and not even offering the kind of value for money that would justify not being edgy. If I wanted mediocre pizza, I'd go to Cici's and eat way more at a fraction of the price. If I wanted good pizza, I'd go to any number of local pizza places. If I wanted to eat at the mall, there are many more choices. So I'm not seeing a reason to return. That said, I thought the restaurant was clean and well-kept. The restroom was upscale, like washing your hands at the Trump Tower. Service was pretty good too, except that the server seemed a bit too eager to take my plate away before I had finished eating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark?start=20

I grabbed an appetizer of these delicious little fried egg rolls that were STUFFED with avocado and chicken among other treats. I wasn't sure what to get at first until my server Carly recommended them to me! She was spot on about them being the best. Food was good and my server was so sweet even though I think she had bigger parties nearby. It's nice to know that small parties of 1 are just as important as big parties. She even got me more water and a takeout box without me having to ask!! It's really the little things that make me want to come back out to eat.

Barrett L.,"Washington, DC",661,286,,3.0,1/26/2013,"Um...It's a CPK, so don't get your hopes up. Came here on the early side of Saturday night after picking up some stuff from the mall.  Haven't been to one of these guys since I was much younger.  The menu's changed, axing some of my favorites (RIP Peking Duck Pizza) in favor of a more concise menu.  We split an original crust (Chipotle Chicken) and a thin crust (Spinach and Artichoke) pizza, and I gotta say the thin crust was leaps and bounds better: less doughy, able to taste the toppings more, and just felt more like pizza.  But on the whole, the food was nothing special.   Service was fine and pricewise it's super affordable.  My only complaint is that it was just really loud and there were a lot of families (as there should be at a mall restaurant on the early side of a weekend night).  I couldn't understand why people would want to wait (it's just not worth it).  Overall, it's fine if you're looking for a sit down place with inexpensive gourmet-ish food that tastes pretty good, but I've had better elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark?start=20

Danielle A.,"Mt Laurel, NJ",7,38,,1.0,10/5/2015,"If it was possible to give this place 0 stars I would.  Our server, some young guy, was beyond terrible.  There is a difference between having a bad day and messing up once and screwing up everything.  We were a party of 3 and came in at 815, so it wasn't too crowded.  I had to ask him three times for a glass of water that I ordered when he wrote our other drinks down.  Every time I would ask he would forget and I would see him leaning against a wall talking to a server instead.  I had to keep reminding him for our bread because every time I would ask, he wouldn't bring it and instead would talk to servers.  I'm pretty sure he was on something because we had to repeat our order to him several times (nothing was even modified).  Additionally, we ordered two mango iced teas (that I'm almost positive the servers make), and they were I drinkable because half the glass was syrup.  We ordered one cup of coup (asked it to come out first) and a small plate guac appetizer.  30 minutes goes by, and no soup or guac.  I'm staring around and finally the server sees me and realizes he never brought me soup.  So he brings it over (cold by the way), and tells me he ""assumed there was a food runner working but there wasn't"" so that is why I didn't get my soup.  Yea, let's tell your table that you aren't doing your job, smart!  I would have been fired from my restaurant for using such a crappy excuse and not doing my job.  It's called SERVING.  Do your job.  Oh and he brought the soup over with the meals even though I wanted it as my app.  Then I ask where our guac appetizer is and he just stares at me.  He NEVER brought it.  He says ""I don't know where it is.""  Well, if he had came to check on us like any server should do after we were supposed to get our apps, he would have known.  So I ask for a manager, and the manager comes to speak to us 15 minutes later.  I told him everything...he still didn't bring the guac!  What the hell is wrong with this restaurant?  Poor service, poor management, and cold food.  I've worked as a server for years and I would have been fired for providing such a poor dining experience. NEVER will I return here again.  I don't remember the servers name, but if you have a young guy (early 20's) with dark hair, just leave while you can.  This establishment is an embarrassment.  Like I said, I've worked in a restaurant.  I know stuff happens, but if standing around talking to other servers is more important than providing service to a whopping two small tables, then this is not the job for you.  I am glad I was able to vent on Yelp, because I really don't think the manager understood how upset we were.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark?start=20
Tarae-Sha H.,"New Castle, DE",0,5,,3.0,2/7/2015,"My father and I went early afternoon on a Saturday, there was a few minute wait but the welcome desk was loaded with strollers and no space, with me having a sprained ankle it was a bit of an inconvenience. Our server was Carley, we sat for a few minutes before she brought us coasters. She dropped them off and said I'll be back in a minute. Several minutes later she came back and seemed polite. We ordered everything and told her we were on a time crunch. Several more minutes lapsed until she returned with out soup and drinks. Once our soup was almost gone she brought us bread and told us to eat it with our soup. Then she walked away bc a previous customer had returned and requested her. We barely made any contact after that. She immediately ignored us and helped only that table with us and another table being unattended. When we received our food, which was delicious, we had previously requested extra sauce. Receiving this sauce from someone else, it was ice cold. Because our waitress was not attentive we started eating our pizza until she arrived to heat the sauce. She did not look interested in being at work or happy to be around people. Several times I witnessed her rolling her eyes after walking away. Her associate Danny looked like he was a great server and he was smiling everytime he passed.

The food is consistent with other CPK locations I have visited. They have quite a few lunch options on the lighter side.  I have two complaints about this location. First, there is a musty, damp, wet dog smell. You will notice it upon walking in and you will eventually get used to it but it is not appetizing. Secondly, the waitstaff is rather slow so it is not ideal for a quick lunch.

I have been to CPK several times, from New York to New Jersey to Pennsylvania, and now this one. Every time I have eaten here, I have never been disappointed. CPK consistently delivers an enjoyable meal each time I've eaten there. This last time around, we ordered the mac n cheese bites off of their small cravings menu for an appetizer. These were made with panko bread crumbs, which made them taste really good; we only wished it came with some kinda of sauce to dip. For dinner, I ordered the habanero carnitas pizza, and my fiancé ordered the wild mushroom pizza. Both of these were really good, in particular the habanero carnitas pie was UNBELIEVABLY good! The pie came with a habanero salsa on the side to add as much as you want; it was so good, but really spicy! All in all, this was another worthy experience at the CPK at the Christiana Mall.

We knew we'd commit a very special Christmas murder if we didn't get food in our guts soon. Remembering the plethora of restaurants attached to the mall we ventured outside and found a California Pizza Kitchen.  We were immediately seated in a large booth and the service was good.  We dinner plans and didn't want to fill up, just prevent our arrests, so we split a plain pizza and some fried artichokes.  The artichokes were tiny little canned quarters deep fried and served with some weird dip. I wouldn't order them again.  Our pizza was pretty tiny for the price but the perfect snack portion for the moment.  It had an oddly sweet crust but the cheese and sauce were fine.  I would never make it a point to visit CPK, but it did the trick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark?start=20

Each of our five family members ate 2.20 chips.  I don't know -  with all the dining options around the mall now, I likely won't go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark?start=40
Thomas N.,"Newark, DE",2,8,,2.0,3/25/2013,"I generally like to take my family here as we've had positive experiences in the past. Unfortunately, our experience with the service we received was below our expectations. Our server was inattentive to our needs. We had requested our daughter's dish (Fettuccini with Alfredo sauce) to come before or during our appetizer. When the appetizer was delivered by another member of the serving team, we did not have the pasta for our daughter. When we asked about the dish we were rushed a lukewarm to cool dish. Drinks were not taken away once finished, requests for refills were delayed to the point I cancelled my drink order. We were interested in dessert, but considering the turnaround we saw in our requests, we decided against dessert shortly after we received our dessert menu. After waiting for 10 minutes I asked for the check and left dissatisfied.  Our food was fine. Chipotle pizza was decent, but a bit over-done. Our chicken lettuce wraps were good and the highlight of our lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark?start=40
Bigfoot A.,"Wilmington, DE",1,8,,3.0,12/18/2012,"Went here for lunch while Christmas shopping and got the spinach and artichoke di[p to start. I wasn't really impressed and neither was my girlfriend.  I like garlic but I thought they overdid it and my girl said it tasted like it came out of the microwave.  We both got salads and we both liked them.  The cobb was good, but you can't really mess that up.  The other was a grilled veggie salad with salmon.  My girlfriend like it but said that she should have got the half size because she couldn't finish it all.  Our server was attentive, but she should have been because she only had one other table besides ours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark?start=40
R. K.,"Broomall, PA",0,36,,1.0,10/24/2012,"Let me first say, that the food is delicious. A half salad here is the size of a normal salad at other restaurants, and the pizza options seem endless. With that being said, the wait staff is AWFUL! I have been to other CPK's when it was extremely busy, and received stellar service. This was my first and LAST visit to this location. I came here for lunch on a Saturday and it was extremely slow.....I thought it would be a plus for us, it wasn't. The hostess sat us and we waited over 10 minutes for our server. When she finally did appear, we put in our drink and lunch orders. She didn't return again until our food came. Midway through our lunch, both drinks were very empty....but let me just say, she had another table around us and could have stopped twice before this to check in on us. Finally, I got up and went to the kitchen area to get refills. Apparently, the kitchen is where ALL the wait staff hang out. I saw our waitress, but she let another waiter come up to me and asked what I needed. I was polite and asked him if I could get refills of our drink, then this smart ass tells me it's going to be $20.....haha, I get it your a comedian, but i'm thirsty. Our waitress, then comes up takes the glasses and tells me they will be right out.....like 5 minutes later. I really don't know what was up with the wait staff here. It was not busy at all, and it seemed like they couldn't handle two tables each. My advice to their management would be to can your wait staff that was working the lunch shift on Saturday Oct. 20.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark?start=40
David W.,"Middletown, DE",1,39,,4.0,7/15/2011,"My wife and I stopped here for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon at 1:30 with our 16 month old son.  The restaurant was pretty empty at that hour which worked in our favor since we had the baby.  Pizza's here are always great but the thing that really sets this place apart is the great children's menu.  It goes way beyond the usual crap that you see everywhere else.  I loved my BBQ Chicken pizza.  The wife loved her Greek pizza.  And the baby loved his Kid's Grilled Chicken pizza.  Very kid friendly place.  Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't bring a baby on a weekend night with the Christiana crowds but during off hours this place can't be beat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark?start=40
Joshuah M.,"Smyrna, DE",0,5,,4.0,12/2/2013,"It was an alright experience. I liked the california and jamaican jerk pizza. We were worried about how the service was going to be because of some of the reviews. It wasn't too bad but the place was dead for a sunday night. $45 plus tip for 3 pizzas, a soup, and 4 waters.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark?start=40
Jeff G.,"San Diego, CA",17,131,3,4.0,9/17/2010,"I try to avoid chain places but cpk is usually good and this one follows suit.  The place is clean, staff is fast and friendly, and the most important thing, then food was good.  The only thing scary about the place is the main door.  It is an accident waiting to happen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark?start=40
Michael K.,"Philadelphia, PA",18,28,6,2.0,12/21/2010,"Went here on a Sunday night with some friends and was reminded why i don't frequent chain restaurants.  Service was TERRIBLE!  Somehow 4 soups managed to make it to our table before a draft beer and a glass of wine.  Three of the four entrees ordered were served  incorrect, although they were surprisingly delicious.  For the price, you're better off going some where else, $92 for a 4 top seemed steep for the atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark?start=40
Josh H.,"Middletown, DE",0,4,,3.0,3/6/2011,"As expected the pizza is delicious. A little overpriced for what you get, but you can be guaranteed to leave full. Not happy that they added gratuity, but I understand why they do it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark?start=40
Don M.,"Newark, DE",3,10,,3.0,9/6/2010,This is the 1st time we have been here and dispite the slow service and cold atmosphere the food was pretty good. Will give this another try but if service doesn't improve we will scratch it off our list,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark?start=40
