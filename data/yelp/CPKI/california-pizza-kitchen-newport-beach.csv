Freddie S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/6/2017,Worst restaurant experience of my life. 1:15 minute wait for food. Salmon was inedible. Kids pasta was cold and hard. Club pizza had 1 sliver of chicken on it. The server never offered to refill our drinks one time in an hour and a half. Said they would bring bread and never did. Terrible management of what was once a great place to eat. It was so bad that this is the first time I've ever complained about a restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach?start=40

Kailee K.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,1,,1.0,11/16/2016,"Soooo disappointed. Came here for a celebratory dinner with my boyfriend, and everytime (which was about 5 times) someone came up to us to ask for our orders and give us our check or ask how we were doing it was a different employee..? Probably the worst place we could've picked at fashion island. I didn't like what I ordered at all, so they at least comped my meal, and I appreciate that. But I won't be returning to this location.

Order will be ready at 6:50, pulled in to curbside and it wasn't ready so I walked upstairs and waited for 40 minutes because ""my salad wasn't ready.""  Not only had they given it away, they didnt make a new one until I asked them to find out if they were remaking it. Orion was totally overwhelmed and useless. Not his fault since he was alone taking orders, running orders, answering the phone, and packing up orders. Never again!!!!!

Bianca F.,"Newport Beach, CA",1,9,,2.0,10/3/2017,Came here for dinner with my friend for her birthday.  We were seated quickly which was nice and gave our drink order. it was happy hour so we decided to do the margaritas.  they were HORRIBLE so syrpy.  The service was horrible the server would literally dart by us and ignore us when we tried to ask for something.  When i ordered the food i asked for everything we wanted on the side so they knew what to bring and he completely forgot everything.  I had to ask for everything at least 3 times for it to be brought.  It completely ruined the meal.  finally after waving him down to pay he ran off with our check and credit cards even though we were seated right next to the register.  We saw him come out and go help several tables without even looking our way.  Finally 20 minutes later he went and rang up or cards and brought us the receipt.  No apologies for the delay or anything.  I will not be returning to his section.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach?start=40
Michelle L.,"Sacramento, CA",170,188,159,5.0,1/24/2014,"My first time at CPK and it was in SoCal! Funny because we have some in Sacramento but I've never been to it after all these years.  The chicken tequila pasta is a must try! It's really good. Not like your usual pasta. It's more like a pesto/Alfredo versus a tomato pasta. The noodles are green and the sauce for this pasta is so good. We also got the chicken chipotle pizza which ones with a sauce on the sauce. Eat it with the sauce! It makes a big difference. We also tried the carnitas tacos and it was pretty good. The carnitas are soft and it also comes with chips and salsa.  The pasta and pizza are about $13-15. It's a little more expensive than BJ's but it's not bad. I usually don't eat too much so I would prefer to share. Our server was also very attentive. He seemed a little nervous and wasn't sure what to say, but he got us everything we needed and made sure we were okay. He even got is a to go cup for the ice tea so that was pretty cool.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach?start=40

We were seated immediately and the hostess let us choose the table we wanted. We ended up sitting right next to the window, so we had an incredible view of the ocean while eating! :) Our waiter came over right away and brought us our drinks. He was speedy throughout our visit. Even the White Pizza we ordered came out surprisingly quickly! The pizza itself was incredible--it had several cheeses (including ricotta ), caramelized onion, and spinach. My friend and I shared it and we felt it was just enough for the two of us! It was relatively quiet inside even though it was about one o'clock on a Saturday. Overall, we were more than pleased with the kind service and beautiful view. We felt that our pizza was well worth the $13 + tip.

Maria B.,"Anaheim, CA",0,7,,1.0,3/17/2017,"I've given this place the benefit of the doubt for a long time already. I always call in my order (my favorite is chicken tequila fett!) and they always take forever even after the promised (ETA) time. I ordered my food around 11:13 and was told it'd be ready around 11:29 which is really reasonable. I get there and the servers kept telling me it'd be anther minute bla bla bla. I lost my patience when I realized it had been 11:50 and I still hadn't received my food. I kindly asked for my money back and they did (manager was nice but when you're on your lunch break and have a certain amount of time to get your food you tend to not be in the greatest mood). To top it off as I was walking out, I over heard a lady said she had been waiting for 30 minutes..... Place needs more training and to know not to lie to customers when they're starving and waiting for their food :) won't be back here and if you're on a tight schedule I WOULD NOT recommend this spot.

Kev O.,"Irvine, CA",32,391,868,3.0,10/4/2014,"I've been a long time CPK diner in the SF bay area, Houston Texas, and parts of Asia, but this was my first time visiting this outlet. I normally order either their good sized and delicious salads and/or pizzas, and various yummy appetizers....Spinach and Artichoke Dip being my fave, but this time I thought I'd try something less carby since I was dining alone. I went ahead and ordered the Roasted Garlic Chicken breast served over grilled carrots and potatoes. Boy.....the chicken was dry, very salty, and swimming in a pool of oil. Lets just say I will most likely never order this again and next time I will just stick to what they're best known for. The location is actually very nice.....located at the Fashion Island mall, and given a window table, I could take in the awesome view of the ocean beyond while enjoying my lunch. Service was excellent as it's always been at every outlet I've been to. My server (Aliyah) was very friendly, courteous, and helpful....always making sure that I was well taken care of. I felt bad about complaining about the meal after getting such great service, so I just sucked it up as a lesson learned for my next trip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach?start=40

Barbara Z.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,12,11,1.0,9/13/2015,"Based on my experience this restaurant has a poor costumer service. The waiter was in a constant hurry and pushing, to the point we had to tell her to just back off! When we sat down she was asking for the orders, and when we were served she asked if we wanted boxes to go! Soon after that she came asking if we wanted the desert menu ( we had started eating)!

John G.,"CORONA DL MAR, CA",3,38,7,1.0,10/4/2015,This was a terrible experience.   It took forever for our food to arrive (felt like an hour) and it was mediocre at best.  I had the garlic spinach pizza (on the cover of their menu).  The crust was like a wet sponge.   The the smoke alarm went off and they didn't know how to turn it off.  So we had to sit in a restaurant plugging our ears because of the ear piecing sound. You would think they would comp our dinner considering the circumstances but NO.  And that is why I wanted to take the time to write this review.  I'll never go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach?start=40
Vivian N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,2.0,3/29/2016,"I have visited numerous CPKs and this location definitely is not up to par as the others. The environment was nice (well-decorated, well-lit, not too loud) and the food was decent, but the service was lacking. Not only did it take ages for our food to come out, but the waiters were uninviting and unfriendly. We had a couple different waiters who seemed to hover over our table and who would constantly walk by, staring at us, not saying anything. It made my guests and I extremely uncomfortable.

Caribbean Sunset Sangria was delicious! Pesto Cream Penne was delicious! The food was pretty good but the noise level of 8 year old girl scouts and cheerleaders was a bit much for me.  Their constant screams were too much to take.  Now I understand why there was no wait time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach?start=40
Hashanah555 K.,"Newport Beach, CA",64,281,572,4.0,12/6/2017,"5 stars for my server Rommel. I was undecided between 2 soups and he said he could bring me a sample of one. - The barley / smashed pea wasn't that great (it had an undesirable earthiness) - So I opted for the tortilla soup and it was outstanding! They have a lunch duo special soup n salad, that you can then upgrade the soup to a bowl for +$2. - If you ask for extra red onions there is a charge, oh well. The petite wedge salad was outstanding. The thick bacon was mighty tasty. The blue cheese dressing was a little strong, but maybe I will get this again but with a diff dressing. Their sourdough bread and butter is consistently great! Place is pretty clean, except I had to brush away a few bread crumbs (still cleaner than SBUX).

Ross D.,"Los Angeles, CA",48,42,4,2.0,12/8/2017,"Went on our ""Date Night"" and sat at the bar.   Watched pizzas getting cooked in the oven.  We ordered two pizzas.   One came out right and the other was completely wrong.  Waiter admitted that he ""rang it in wrong and would take care of it.""    We wondered what he meant by ""take care of it.""   Does that mean he would comp the pizza as it was his mistake?   Hmm we would have to wait and see.    So I started in on my pizza.  I had about half before I stopped eating. The corrected  pizza had yet to come out and I didn't want to finish my meal before the other one came out.  In that time, we saw multiple pepperoni pizzas go In and come out of the oven.  Surely one of them was going to be ours. Nope.   Meanwhile, my other half of the pizza got cold.   Eventually, our other pizza came out Nice and hot.     We finished our meal without any other hiccups.   Same waiter cleared our table and brought the bill with no further apology or discussion.  Like it never happened and the bill reflected that too.  Still trying to figure out what the waiter meant by ""take care of it.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach

Chelsey H.,"Corona, CA",22,38,154,5.0,10/25/2017,"We came to CPK for two reasons: Becca B-Day & The Dodger Game Our adorable waitress (Lorie) was attentive and fun. I mentioned I LOVE the lemonade and asked her to surprise me with a different flavor each time. Instead of the regulars, she mixed flavors and really surprised me! It was delicious and I felt she really cared about our table having an amazing, authentic experience.  While the pizzas are TO DIE FOR! Yup, even the gluten free ones. Everyone already knows that. What you may not know is that the butter cake  should be illegal. Nothing that tastes that good should be allowed all the time. By the end of the night Lorie knew all our names and said g'nite to us individually. Even though the Game stretched on we never felt rushed to leave our table with a perfect view of the tv. (That was requested) while the Dodgers didn't win tonight we had a great time and will definitely be back for game time!

Jenna Y.,"Newport Coast, CA",682,151,286,3.0,3/2/2017,"Just an average CPK location. The convenience of being in a mall where people are frequently shopping makes the location busy during meal times.

A kids cheese pizza had no cheese (very wired, since it's just cheese) and it took forever to get drinks, and bread was also a challenge. The medium pizza was awful too, but the kids mac and cheese was the ONLY item that was cooked well and tasted halfway decent. Just a mess of an evening at CPK......And by the way, there was three other tables that complained, and a group of young adults/teens that walked out, so that shows how many people were unhappy.

Val S.,"Lake Forest, CA",2,6,1,1.0,5/7/2017,Came for late lunch with my family on Sunday May 27th at 2:45 pm approximately.   Waited less tha 4 min for seating which is good. Here are the reasons why I gave a 1 star: 1. The table we were given was dirty - our greeter/seater apologized for it. Since I have a kid I always carry sanitizer wipes so I had to clean the table myself. 2. We were not offered/given a kids menu - In my party there was a 5yr old and we were not asked if we wanted a kids menu. 3. Bathroom issues - the women's bathroom had no toilet paper or the cover seats. The men's bathroom had a overflow sink that had the floor wet. In summary I will never come back here and will not recommend.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach?start=20

I don't know who is in charge of hiring at this location, but they are making some bad choices!  We were assigned to a table in Cassidy's section and the way she greeted us with a miserable look on her face and throwing down napkins when it was time to bring out drinks, was just unacceptable.  Going out to eat is a luxury. She made my family and I feel as though we should have been the ones to feel so privileged to be served by her. That's such a horrible feeling and I'm sure many others can relate.

I don't understand why would you invent a pizza where you put salad on top of it . Also there was BARELY any cheese . It was a light weight pizza .

I don't like to put poor reviews but the service was extremely poor. From the very moment we walked in, the two men working the host station were preoccupied with their own conversation - can you imagine what the topic was between two males just getting a paycheck for not working?  Exactly...exactly nothing. When we sat down our server was extremely lacking in common care. We had to wait for water, bread, napkins. It was not what you expected from a place that 20 years ago was the gold standard in food service.  Oh well, that's the reason why Cheese Cake Factory and PF Chang's had hour waits while this place was zero wait. Sad, because when I'm down in Newport, we always go to all three places as most people do. I'm sure that this will be the last time I go to this location until a change is made to the team.

Took my beau to the CPK at Fashion Island and instantly, I expected this location to up its game; I haven't been to many CPK's, but according to my boyfriend... they're all pretty nice! Atmosphere - check!  Wait was 10 minutes for lunch on a Sunday, which was really awesome since I was hungry. Once we sat, we ordered drinks right away, was served bread with olive oil and then ordered our food a few minutes after. Everything regarding service went very smoothly! The bread with the seasoned olive oil is amazing... I could pour/dip/sip everything all up in that goodness. For our mains, we went with the mushroom sausage pepperoni pizza and the jambalaya fettuccine to share. Each entree was about $14-15, prices I'd expect for this type of American restaurant chain. With the size of the pizza, it was a little disappointing, however, it tasted so good and so fresh, and the crust was so CHEWY, I soon forgot all qualms I had.  The jambalaya pasta is definitely something to order - spicy, jumbo juicy shrimps, andouille sausage and chunky pieces of ham. It's not as saucy, but it is coated with plenty of cajun spices and spicy oils. Once again, portion is slightly smaller than other restaurants (i.e. Cheesecake Factory) for about the same price, however, I enjoyed the quality of the dish. Overall, great experience!

The menu is has your normal items from appetizers, salads, soups pizza etc.  Well since the restaurant is called California PIZZA kitchen I decided to go with a pizza. White Pizza ~   The pizza has Mozzarella, Fontina, Ricotta, Parmesan, Pecorino Romano and sautéed garlic spinach. They also listed Applewood Smoked Bacon so I added that to mine.  The crust was thinner than your typical delivery pizza but thicker than your thin crust.  It didn't have any sauce so the crust was not soggy.  The 5 cheeses all blended really well together.  The spinach was a great addition although I didn't taste any of the garlic.  The bacon brought it all home as it often does in a dish!

I wasn't aware that the menu changed until a while after because I didn't have the chance to go.  As a small celebration (and my craving for pesto chicken pizza) my bf and I decided to go (last month?).  To say I was upset doesn't come close...I can't help that I love food! Miso Salad with Chicken --Gone.  This was my favorite salad and I always ordered it as a starter (shared between me and my bf).. I was sad to see it not on the menu.  The closest I could get to it was the Thai crunch salad which I found too sweet for my liking.  It just wasn't the same. Pesto Chicken Pizza--This was the one that made me really sad to see gone.  First my salad now this.  This was by far my favorite FAVORITE pizza and I'm still sad to see it gone.  I just couldn't believe it  and nothing on the menu came close.  I thought that I'd go ahead and order my second favorite .. Four Seasons Pizza--Gone!!!  I went to order this and saw that it was also gone!!! This was the hump that broke the camels back.  I was heart broken.  I ended up ordering the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Pizza which came recommended but it was not the same.  Maybe my depression over not having any one of my favorites on the menu made this pizza taste like cardboard to me?  I don't know. Since that sad experience, I haven't had the will or urge to go back.  Everything I loved about this place is gone.  I have no reason to return..unless they bring at least one of these back?!  Why remove something off the menu that worked and was good?  It made the okay service worth the visit!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach?start=80

Courtney H.,"Noblesville, IN",170,21,6,4.0,11/19/2016,"Went to this location after spending some time shopping with friends. We got an appetizer while we waited for some friends to arrive. Our waiter was super friendly! I ordered one of the salads and asked for no cilantro. When we got our food I started eating mine and noticed something right away- it had cilantro! I politely told the waiter as I totally understand mistakes are made. He took my salad and said he would be right back. He then brought my salad back to me and let me know that they can't make the salad without cilantro, it is already in the mixture and can't be taken out...this would of been nice to know BEFORE I ordered as I could of got something else! I decided to tough it out and take the salad anyways, my friends ate it and I had already eaten the appetizer so I wasn't upset. Though the waiter was very friendly about it, I think the manager should of come out to apologize or explain the situation to me.. not sent the waiter out to say ""my manager says..."" he then offered to take the salad off the bill.. I said that wasn't needed but he said he was going to do it anyways. When we got our bill, the salad was on there. I wasn't going to say anything, but my friends insisted that they were going to say something.. in the end he took the salad off the bill, but it was a hassle and a long process.. one of my friends sandwiches order was not correct either but we didn't want to feel like we were complaining/ being annoying by correcting all of our orders. Not the best experience, but I still give 4 stars because I do love this place and they DID take my salad off the bill when in reality most places will only apologize or give you a little coupon even if you don't touch the food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach?start=60

The food came out in about 10-15 minutes.  The bbq chicken pizza barely had any chicken on it, but other than that, it was good.  However, I did not enjoy the hawaiian. I don't know if it's just this location, but the ham was too hard to chew and I didn't like the flavor at all. The crust was also lacking softness, and ended up being chewy and tough.

Rick C.,"Newport Coast, CA",6,70,,3.0,10/14/2014,"CPK's are always good wherever they are.  They are usually warm and inviting. Not so at the Fashion Island restaurant.  For some reason, the restaurant always seems cold and uncomfortable.  Even in the summer.   The food's good, like standard CPK.  But it's the cold discomfort that makes you want to leave before you're done. They need to find out why it's so cold and uncomfortable -- especially toward the back of the restaurant -- where they have a tendency to seat you first.  If they could fix the temperature, it would improve the ambience significantly and make this CPK as good, if not better, than most.   If you do go, ask for a seat toward the front of the restaurant.  It's most comfortable there.  From what I've found, the best place to sit is at the bar.  They'll bring your food quickly plus a nice glass of wine.

The staff was very friendly and straightforward about this and even helped me locate the gf entrees marked on their normal menu before seating. All 1 of them. 1. Single. GF. Item.   This 1 item happened to be the salmon - with the substitution of stir fried veggies for whatever the normal addition was. This also happens to be one of the most expensive menu items there ($18). I should have simply walked out and gone the ten feet to PF Changs but the bf has an aversion to good food and wanted pizza. The salmon was dry and small. The veggies were veggie-like and bountiful. I'm not sure if there is normally a sauce of some type that goes over the salmon, but don't bother ordering it even if there is. I couldn't even finish it. You're better off getting a salmon fillet from the grocery store and tossing it in the toaster oven at home.  -Great service from both the host and waitstaff -If you want a gf pizza at a chain place, go to BJs.

Denise K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",690,409,537,4.0,3/29/2012,"CPK was one of my favorite restaurants as a child. Nowadays, I tend to eat at CPK less often but it's still a good place to satisfy my pizza cravings. I love their salads and pizzas. The pastas are a little whatever for the price... You could probably get much better pasta for the price. Nevertheless, the boyfriend and I decided to try this place for lunch while we were at Fashion Island and were seated right away. The place wasn't busy, but the workers were all very attentive and service was great! Our waiter and then later the waitress who took over were both very friendly and talkative, and our food came out quickly. We had the white corn guacamole and chips for our appetizer and then shared the california club pizza and four cheese ravioli. The white corn guacamole tasted really fresh and was really good for only about 4 bucks! The california club pizza was delicious - there's really nothing like a CPK pizza. It looked like a salad on my pizza! And the avocado on top just made the dish. Of course, the four cheese ravioli was pretty good but nothing amazing. We were so full and couldn't even finish our pizza but when I do save room, I always get their tiramisu for dessert.

EDIT: The manager was supposed to refund our salad lunch(we ordered a full salad but were given a half salad that was pass off as a full salad) BUT NEVER DID.  Day I visited: May 23rd, 2012 at about 2pm. Who I went with: My 2 friends and my one year old son. Location wise it's not the greatest. If you've never been to Fashion Island before you will miss it. It's hidden in the corner by PF Changs and on the other side there is The Cheesecake Factory.  There weren't that many guests inside and the greeter was not insight. We waited a couple minutes and finally were greeted and seated in the way back near the bathrooms. The bathrooms are clean but do not have any baby changing tables so parents remember to change your little one in one of the bathrooms near the movie theatres. Even though there were only a few people inside the restaurant it took a while for the waiter to come our way. I don't mind waiting but it did get annoying trying to catch our waiters attention where we were seated in the way back so no one could see us. Did I mention we were near the bathrooms? Yeah. That's kind of gross. From the time we were seated to the time it took our orders to arrive took about 45 minutes. Maybe they forgot about us? I don't know but it took forever for them to take our orders. We ordered one full size Original Chopped Salad, full size Caramelized Peaches Salad and a California Club Pizza. Our pizza was pretty good but I wish it was served hot instead of warm. It took way too long for them to serve us our food and I'm pretty sure they forgot we were seated in the back. When our salads arrived I was confused because we ordered full size salads but they came in small plates. When I questioned our waiter on whether we were mistakenly served the half sized dish he got agitated and told us that our small salads were the full sized ones. I didn't want to send the salad back because it took so long for them to make it and by that time my son was so hungry he was crying. I went to a different CPK a few days ago and ordered a half salad for dinner and when it arrived it came on the same small plate my friends and I were served the last time we went and was told off that it was a full size salad. I asked the waitress if the full size salads were served on the same plates and she told us the full size salads are served on their big oval bowl like plates and they would never be served on their small plates. I called the CPK at Fashion Island to tell them that their cooks and waiters passing off the half salads as a full size one and the manager I talked to today was very nice and said she would talk to her staff. She also offered a certificate as an apology for what happened and explained that they were currently in the process of cutting back the number of plates they use and was probably a mix up on their part. EDIT: Did not receive a refund and it has been a month since my friends and I visited. Go to the location at either Irvine Spectrum or the one off Michelson in Irvine.

My wife asked for a refill THREE times.   The server never brought it.  Finally another server with a pitcher noticed it was empty and refilled it for us.  I'd like to think our server was swamped with too many tables and I took that into consideration, but she only had 3 tables for the majority of the time we were there.  No bueno!

Elleen P.,"Boston, MA",82,511,256,3.0,6/11/2013,"When we were first seated, our server obviously recognized that we were kids & served us in that manner. When we were ordering, he assumed that we wanted an appetizer as our entire entree as if we were that cheap to come to a sit-down restaurant to eat a macaroni & cheese fried ball.  Then, he asked us if we would like bread to start us off. When we asked for a second round, he gave us three.. one for each of us, instead of refilling the entire thing (5 pieces). He also acted surprised that we would want another round of bread... well when your food is taking thirty minutes to come out, yes. We need our bread. We also ordered the garlic fettucine with shrimp & margarita (sp?) pizza. The food was taking a pretty long time to come out, and the guy was obviously working for tips. He kept apathetically apologizing for the wait, and even told us that he notified his manager and said that she might come to speak with us, but it never happened. Then, at the end, he sarcastically apologized for the food taking so long and said that it had been happening all day. If it was happening all day, then why would you notify your manager? (This manager.. who never came to speak with us?) In general, his attitude showed that he was feeling arrogant because he was serving kids, and definitely treated us like kids.

Patrick C.,"Arcadia, CA",69,320,198,4.0,8/20/2007,"Back in my poor highschool/college student days, I couldn't comprehend how people could spend $10-$15 on this froo froo pizza.  Portion was too small to me compared to the average pizza a growing boy would consume.  Now that I'm all growned up and making my gazillion dollars, I can appreciate it more...plus, it fills me up now.  This particular location boasts a great view.  Thumbs up on the service too.  I am a little disappointed that CPK axed the Peking Duck Pizza, but I can honestly say that they have improved overall over the years.  My suggestion is... if you're gonna go crazy with pizza toppings, might as well go all out.  Now, show me my King Crab and Jumbo Shrimp Pizza... or Baby Back Rib Pizza... and deep dish that sucker!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach?start=160

Zeke S.,"Santa Clara, CA",50,254,,4.0,7/13/2007,"After a flat out awful experience in the El Torito Grill next door the night before I went in expecting little. Further, my main experience with the chain are the little mini versions I have run accross in airports. Never quite got what the big deal was...  But I was impressed with the pizza here. I mean it was good. My one kid got a ham and pinnaple and the other got a honey chicken (which he actually was not too fond of, but I thought it was cool). We got the Greek pizza. Well, my wife got it and I decided not to argue about why the hell one would get a salad on a pizza instead of getting a pizza and a side salad. But here I wold have been wrong. It was covered with cold olives, cucumbers, you know, greek stuff. And it was good, real good.  The location is great, big glass windows from which you can see all the way down to the waterfront. Fashion Island which houses it is a really nice mall as far as malls go. And lastly, the service the day we were here was flat out great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach?start=160
Michelle W.,"Mission Viejo, CA",38,61,4,5.0,1/16/2012,"Everyone knows that the food at CPK is good. I recommend the new Hawaiian BBQ Pizza. When we went to the CPK in Fashion Island a couple of days before Christmas, it was very crowded. Even so, the service was very good. Our server, Oscar, anticipated our every need and want. He was very patient with the small children in our party, who have special dietary needs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach?start=160
Krista B.,"Corona del Mar, CA",1,75,,2.0,9/10/2007,"It is not particularly for this location.  I am not a big fan of CPK.  Only time I would go there is..... After shopping at Fashion Island, kids are hungry, hubby is away on business trip, I...am tired and just don't want to cook.... situations. Kids seems love it.  I do enjoy the view from the window.  I've seen many mothers appeared to be in my situations eating there this summer....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach?start=160
Shawn C.,"Miami, FL",0,4,,1.0,4/15/2012,"First and last time eating here. I thought the waiter was joking when he brought out my Hawaiian; it looked like a kid's pizza, and the food quality was very low. I would much prefer Papa John's over CPK. I don't know how they can serve crap like that with a straight face(for $12 no less!). My wife had the chicken pasta, and again it was very low quality food. She ate the couple of small pieces of chicken and couldn't stomach the rest. Very disappointing food, and a total waste of money. I'm not sure how CPK is able to stay in business judging by their food. The people at the tables around ours didn't seem very enthused about their food, either. If you are at Fashion Island, skip this place and go to Cheesecake Factory next door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach?start=160
Thomas V.,"Newport Beach, CA",8,12,,3.0,8/22/2009,This place is  good.  Kid friendly. Can be busy since it gets all of the overflow from Cheesecake Factory next to it. The red velvet cake was good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach?start=160
Sarah S.,"Irvine, CA",42,38,76,4.0,4/5/2009,"California pizza kitchen is quite good. Their BBQ Chicken Pizza is quite delectable, as well as their thai pizza. They have great Italian sodas and while quite pricey, it is almost to be expected with the quality of their food. Their service is satisfactory, while not perfect, and it is a great place to eat for a celebration or to impress your high-end friends while not going broke.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach?start=160
Ashley G.,"Portland, OR",87,353,280,2.0,11/28/2010,"My friend and I decided to go here on my recent trip back to OC. I would've preferred to eat at the place next door, but the wait was twice as long. There is not much to select from vegan-wise at CPK, but I've previously liked the dakota smashed pea & barley soup well enough. It was kind of a chilly night so I thought this would be satisfactory. While we were waiting for our food, I was perusing the nutritional info menu for fun. I made my friend guess the highest calorie item on the menu (close to 1700 for one of their meaty pizzas). I made the mistake of looking at the sodium content of my soup (2100 mg per bowl!). When it arrived, somehow all I could taste was the saltiness. I've had this soup plenty of times and never had been so overpowered with a salty taste. I asked for and received a side of bread to eat with my soup. The bread was completely tasteless. They did not have an crackers to offer with their soup either. All in all, a disappointing meal. I don't think I'll be back unless I have to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach?start=160
Sarah R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,20,,1.0,2/28/2013,"I went to CPK at Fashion Island a few days ago.  It was not the experience I was looking for.  I don't like to give bad reviews, but this just didn't live up to any experience I had expected. I've been to the Bella Tera one and it was a great experience.  This time our waiter, Thomas, hardly gave us the time of day.  He was way more interested in the group of girls at another table.  We ordered drinks,  a salad, that was average at best, and a pizza.  It took about 15 minutes to get our drinks and another 10 to get our salad.  When we finally got our pizza (another 20 minutes later) it was barely warm and way too chewy.  When I said something to the waiter, he had a pretty half baked excuse of the kitchen was backed up.  It didn't seem like the other table had any complaints as he had plenty of time to talk with them and flirt a lot. I won't be going back.  Between the service and the food, it just wasn't worth the experience or the money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach?start=160
