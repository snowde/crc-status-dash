Ritvik K.,"Atlanta, GA",292,13,45,4.0,8/15/2017,"For a CPK this location was quite empty and didn't have the usual CPK vibe people are looking for. Nevertheless, this place can seat very large parties. I ordered the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pizza ($12.75). The pizza was okay and I also ordered a side of Chipotle Adobo sauce which makes for a great dipping sauce. Our hostess was very friendly but didn't know the menu that well.  Overall pretty average if you're headed here for a good pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross
Jason R.,"Peachtree Corners, GA",13,27,,2.0,12/18/2017,"There seems to be an unspoken competition at the Forum restaurants as to which can be the worst in customer service.   Mambo Italiano has basically driven everyone in the neighborhood out years ago (how do they stay in business??), Ted's doesn't bother to even seat you anymore (bravo...), but CPK is racing up the line to become the most frustrating. We used to LOVE CPK.  We enjoy the food very much, and come in to get some of our 'regular' favorites.   The last few visits, though, have soured us on repeat visits altogether.     To say the staff is inattentive would be putting it mildly.   We come in, get seated (hey! CPK's already wayyyy ahead of Ted's Montana Grill at the Forum by this standard -- kudos!).   But then, we just sit...and sit...and sit...watching while 6-7 wait staff at CPK walk around.  No one stops by our table, but half huddle by a table in a corner (presumably on break..OK) while another few proceed to walk by the table again.  And again.    Finally, after 15 minutes someone (Martino, I believe, by our check after the meal finally made it to completion an hour or so later) stopped by for our drink order.   Another 10 minutes in and we got the drinks, but after dropping them off our server Martino immediately walks off.    It's another 15 minutes before he stops back by to take our order...so we'd been there **40 Minutes** by that time (we were ready to order when he stopped by to take our drink order but he left before we could even give it....). Starving by that point, we luckily got some bread with olive oil.  By that point, we were so hungry that bread  .   By the time we finally got our food order in, things seemed to be back on track.  Our trusty server Martino, was typically nowhere to be seen.    But, honestly, by the time we got the food ...it was good.   We have no problem with the food at all...but the service...Jeeeeeesh.  CPK managers, we're not difficult customers.  We're not expecting a 5-star dining experience but please, PLEASE, ask the too-cool-for-school staff to at least TRY to care.     The apathy is pretty evident.   40 minutes for a food order is juuuuuuuuust a bit much.      It's really a shame because this trend is only in the last year.  Prior years we always had a great experience -- with friendly staff and great food.   I don't think having someone stop by and take orders in a bit more timely manner is out of the norm.   Maybe we just came at a poor time (late afternoon), but it's been a similar trend on all recent visits this year (we had been stopping by once a week or every two weeks for some time).    With the non-existent service, it's a Hard Pass on CPK from this point forward.   The area is surrounded by restaurants. There's no reason to sit and wait (and wait) when you're going out to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross
Jim R.,"Atlanta, GA",1,13,2,3.0,11/26/2017,"The food is always good here. I recommend the Thai Crunchy salad and the pizza. We usually get great service at the Peachtree Corners restaurant but this visit was below average. There were several waitstaff standing at a table in the corner but our server was cutting fruit for the bar while our salads sat at the counter. Someone who appeared to be a manager followed our server around behind the counter yapping in his ear. I never saw her do anything productive. The bread wasn't ready so we didn't get it until we were done eating. We were full and didn't take it. We arrived at 11:20 and the bread for all tables wasn't ready until 11:50. This could have all been prepared ahead of opening. I'll be back, just a bad day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross
Tracy W.,"Atlanta, GA",57,62,11,2.0,8/30/2017,"I have not been to a CPK in years so today was the day. I kept drooling remembering my Thai Chicken Pizza that I always used to get. For one, I forgot how doggone expensive one of their small pizza's is. I believe that $13+ is a bit pricey for basically a personal sized pizza. I'm not sure if they changed the peanut sauce or what has changed about this pizza but it was NOT as flavorful as I remember. Maybe because they were very chintzy with the sauce so that it was a tad on the dry side and more chicken could have been on it for that price point.  All in all, I ate the pizza because I was about to eat my left foot, I was so hungry. Will I go back? Probably not....or not the one at the Forum.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross

Pooja P.,"Atlanta, GA",0,7,,3.0,12/5/2017,"I went here with 8 friends for my birthday dinner recently. I ordered the pepperoni and mushroom pizza which was tasty, yet I feel like the kitchen staff does not put enough meat on the pizza. The prices are already around $15 for one pizza so I was expecting a good sized portion of meat on the pizza yet the staff was very cheap with how much meat they chose to put on the pizza so I was not getting my money's worth. Other than that, the waiter was friendly yet he got annoyed that my friends had to ask for three rounds of water refills. The service is adequate and luckily the wait time was only two minutes on a Saturday night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross

Dave M.,"Atlanta, GA",59,783,1866,3.0,3/25/2016,"I was pretty surprised by the food. It wasn't that bad. I usually have a negative view of chain restaurants. I got a lunch pizza option ($11). The pizza is about 9"" or so and you get a choice of side. I opted for the quinoa salad. It's really a spinach salad with quinoa sprinkled on top. The pizza was pretty good though. We also got a quac and nacho starter ($5). If you sign up for their rewards program you get a free stater. It was just average tasting. They bring out some bread and olive oil as a complimentary starter. It's a nice touch but can be a carb overload if you eat that and a pizza. The interior was nice, very modern and clean. It's a large location so they can fit most parties. The hostess was very friendly and nice. Our waitress was nice but we hardly saw her again. The service could be improved upon. I don't like waving down my server for things when they should be checking up at times.  Overall, it's not a bad pizza option but I'm not sold.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross
Sari S.,"Duluth, GA",177,258,2354,4.0,12/29/2015,"Visited: 12/26/2015 I've been here several times and have already had pretty great service. Our server when we visited the last time was Elly and she was super sweet & nice! Great service on her part, thank you!!  We ordered: Cheese pizza with pepperoni & mushroom - came out okay since it was an average pizza order. Waldorf Chicken Salad which is my always go to salad here. By the way, this salad never disappoints so I was happy to get my usual :D  In the past, I've even tried their pasta dish - Jambalaya Fettuccine, which I enjoyed as well. Essentially, CPK is like a Cheesecake Factory to me. They are chains and typically all the same. Now, if the food doesn't taste the same, then you know something is wrong. However, since it's always been great here, I can't complain and am a fan. Going to a place like CPK is a nice because you can just grab a bite to eat, knowing what you are going to be served.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross
Kenya H.,"Norcross, GA",0,2,,1.0,9/14/2017,No one answered the phone so I went online & placed a curbside order. Upon arriving half the Forum didn't have lights .

Tuong Vi P.,"Atlanta, GA",133,759,2206,3.0,9/15/2014,"The food is not mind-blowing here at CPK, but I will throw in that this place is consistent. I have eaten at this location a few times over the years and have never experienced bad food or service. Since I have branched out and discovered what amazing culinary gems call Atlanta and its metro area home, it is hard to want to go back to eating at chains. However, I went quite recently because my youngest sister has just started working somewhat nearby and we decided that CPK would be safe for lunch. I met her on a weekday right around noon and was shocked that there were many booths and tables free. I guess maybe The Forum area is not absolutely flooded with office workers? Anyway, I got seated quickly by the nice hostess even though my sister was not yet in my company. I got a booth and our server brought waters as I waited for baby sis. She came in shortly thereafter and we considered the special that the server informed us of, which was signing up for something and getting a free (small) tapas plate. Ummm, we didn't even know what it was but free was attractive and what with spam folders and unsubscribe options available, we gave them everything short of our social security numbers. (See why there needs to be a Cheapskate badge?!?!) We ended up with several small plates for sharing: Spicy Fennel Sausage + Poblano Flatbread, White Corn Guacamole + Chips, Crispy Mac 'n Cheese, and the Spicy Chicken Tinga Quesadilla. Everything was quite good. Service was attentive without being pushy. My sister and I really enjoyed picking off the small plates and my favorites were the White Corn Guac and the Chicken Quesadilla, though that is not to say that I did not like the other items. The food here does not blow me away, as even the more creative dishes are tame and aimed at appealing to a wide crowd. But appeal they do and this is probably my favorite chain restaurant. I have no qualms eating at a CPK when unadventurous people accompany for a meal, even if other great options surround the place, because I know that I will get consistently good food. I have eaten at various CPK locations over the years in different states and I am always pleased by my food. My true rating for this place is 3.5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross
Layla H.,"Cumming, GA",0,58,15,4.0,1/2/2017,It's a chain so you know what to expect.

Bryan L.,"Johns Creek, GA",92,158,126,3.0,5/19/2014,"TL;DR: Atmosphere was very cozy with the gas-fired oven, and most of the pizzas I tasted were dry and lacked flavor. The original BBQ chicken pizza was the exception, and was really tasty and surely recommend it. When you first walk in, you notice the dimly lit room and the gas-fire oven in the back. It's a really cozy atmosphere, and seems perfect for a dinner date with your significant other. I was with a group, so they set up 3 tables just for us. The restaurant felt like a suspended sunset, and most of the decor and lampshades were warm colors and felt very intimate. The attire felt semi-formal: it was kind of casual but then again it's higher than fast food restaurants. You have to remember that CPK is a chain restaurant, but sometimes it doesn't feel like one.  Customer service was good and didn't find any complaints. We went on a Monday evening so it wasn't very busy and the waitresses arrived about 3 minutes after I sat down. They help recommend a few items from the menu and were very courteous.  Most of the pizzas on the menu ranged from $10-$15, while the appetizers were under $10. One pizza can easily serve two individuals, but I would recommend buying two different ones to share with. They also offer tacos, pastas and other side dishes, but I only ordered pizza. CPK offers complementary bread after you order, which I believe was sourdough bread which you can dip in olive oil and herbs.  I've tried the following: Original BBQ Chicken Pizza (hand tossed) - chicken, red onion, cilantro, bbq sauce Sicilian Pizza (thin crust) - salami, Italian sausage, parmesan, oregano, gouda  California Club Pizza (hand tossed) - arugala, basil, romaine, avocado, mozzarella, tomatoes, bacon (Complementary bread) The BBQ chicken pizza was by far the best that I tried. It was a mid-sized pizza, divided into six slices, and it would've been enough for me. The chicken surprisingly was juicy, and the bbq sauce compliments the pizza really well. I was doubtful at first about the bbq sauce + pizza combo, but somehow it worked. The bbq sauce had a sweet, tangy note, and was a pleasure to eat. The red onions on the pizza paired nicely with the chicken. It also was a bit sweet, and gave you a bit of a kick when you bit into the pizza. The cilantro brought everything together, giving the pizza a fresh flavor and didn't make me want to hit the gym afterwards. The crust however was pretty dry, but I didn't expect much about that. Overall the pizza was really nice, and I recommend getting it if you do come here. I think this was the pizza that got them famous, and it still is a must-have on the menu.  The other two pizzas, however, were disappointing. I was expecting a lot from the Sicilian pizza, but it was really dry. I liked the sliced salami and the ham, which were nice compliments to the pizza. The sausage tasted something from a fast-food pizza joint like Dominos, and I have no clue why they added it on. The pizza though was really bland and couldn't taste much.  The California Club pizza was worse. I don't have anything against eating healthy, but if you're going to a pizza restaurant, don't expect to enjoy a healthy pizza, because you ain't gonna' son. The California Club in simplest terms was a salad atop a pizza. The greens even had salad dressing, and my friend ate it with a fork like with a salad. The elements were not cohesive, and it was a fail attempt of a pizza. I could see it working, but each ingredient had a mind of its own. The avocado were in slices and had its own creamy note, the bacon was salty and dry, while the salad...had no flavor. Even when you pick up the pizza, all the greens atop just fall off and you're just left with a dry, salty bacon pizza. It was more like a Cali Clash than a Cali Club. Please don't try to order ""healthy"" items off menus. The bread I heard was hard and dry. I didn't try it, but everyone around me did. I know that I'm using  the word ""dry"" a lot, but they actually were. This restaurant got a lot of bad reviews, but it was okay. It's a chain restaurant anyways, and I didn't really expect much from it. There are better restaurants out there and I recommend going to a local restaurant than this for a date/event. But if you do decide to come here and order pizza, get the BBQ chicken pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross

I ordered the tostada pizza, while others at the table ordered a plethora of other pizza choices. We all traded slices amongst ourselves and I liked the Thai Chicken pizza as well. The best part about this trip to CPK was the waiter. He was very attentive and routinely dropped by to make sure we had everything we needed.

David P.,"Norcross, GA",23,34,,5.0,6/19/2015,"I've had CPK in a few other locations, including some of the sketchy soggy pizza airport locations, but this one has been rather awesome. The food is chain restaurant quality plus one, meaning it's better fare than a lot of other chain places, and super consistent. I've never had to send back anything, ever. The only issue is the bread is sometimes hard, but it's also french bread and you can usually bring it up to them and they'll do something to make it right. The entire wait staff is a dream, they're punctuational, and invested. The management is nice. The to-go window is always staffed and online orders are punctuational and work well. I've been happy with every visit and plan on returning often, it's sort of my local go to place, with service and food that's actually quite better than J Alex next door to it. I have had the following to much joy: California Club Pizza (The salad on top can be sort of bland, but they'll happily dress it anyway you want and the pizza underneath is the real star) Summer Field Salad Tri-Color Salad Pizza Quesdilla, Corn Guacamole, Chicken Egg Rolls Tortilla Spring Rolls (The Mediterranean option is insanely good). Mushroom, Sausage, Pepperoni Pizza Nontraditional Cheese Pizza Spaghetti Bolognese Spaghettini with Asparagus Sicilian Pizza Veggie Pizza (w/ Goat Cheese) One thing to note, sharing a single pizza with two people probably isn't going to work out that well and for the longest time was one of the reasons I didn't like CPK, after I figured a pizza is sort of almost a single portion (with some togo), it became infinitely more enjoyable. The pizzas are a big bigger than a single portion, you'll probably want a bit more than half unless you start with a salad. I'd say consider .75 pizzas per person. The price isn't unreasonable per pizza, the pizzas are priced at entree levels.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross?start=20

Not after the food delivery arrived almost at 8pm when it was due to arrive at 6pm.    I cannot express the stress and embarrassment I had to go through, apologizing to my guests about the delay in food. When people are hungry, people get angry. I think me and my wife called the restaurants at least 3 or 4 times to check up on the status of our delivery, each time the manager told us it will leave in 15minutes.  Please have some courtesy and let us know or call us in advance before we have to call you first, at least I can make arrangements to pick up food elsewhere. You would think cpk would care about an order worth couple of hundred dollars but I guess they didn't because the delivery girl told us that they totally forgot about our order until 30minutes after 6pm.

My girlfriend ordered a pizza and it was mediocre. Need to say I'll give it another chance, probably should order something else next time.

We waited forty-minutes for the six pizzas and two pastas as expected.  The pizza I got was the BBQ Chicken Pizza and to my disappointment, there really wasn't much flavor. The pasta my friend ordered was the Chicken Fettucini. The pasta was creamy and aromatic, though I think CPK adds too much lemon to the food.

The staff here are friendly(most are high-school and college age so some are not very experienced but they're not terrible servers) and the food come out pretty fast.  I come here often to know that the food and service is pretty consistent. I have read over all of the reviews and the content is mostly positive but the reviewers give CPK a 2 or 3 stars....is it because it is not a fancy restaurant with tiny portions?  Anyways, let's get on with the food shall we? This is what I usually order every time:  BBQ chicken chopped- chop chicken, beans, corn, ranch dressing, crunchy tortilla strings drizzle with a light BBQ sauce...remember to add fresh avocado Avocado club egg rolls- this is my favorite it's like a tex-mex egg rolls with chicken and avocado and the dipping sauce is to die for Garlic chicken pizza- if you like garlic then you will love this...beside garlic is a great for your immune system Enjoy and remember do not judge a restaurant just because it's a chain.

My only reservations would be that the service is a bit slow, and some of the servers that I've had didn't check up on us much (especially if we sat outdoors). If the restaurant is busy that's totally understandable, but it's been like this during off-hours, too. As for food--Their complimentary sourdough bread has consistently been rock-hard, which is kind of a shame 'cos I like the taste. The pizzas (The Works, veggie, BBQ, mupsa) are all pretty good, though--I haven't really tried one that I didn't like. Mupsa's my favorite, so far!

The Pizza's are good but why do you have to pay an additional $1.50 for thin crust ?  Less dough should equal less dough; right ? I guess more people are ordering thin crust so they might as well pry another $1.50 per pie out of your wallet. If money is no object go ahead and order soft drinks for the entire family for a family of 6 this will only set you back about $15.00.   The other items on the menu are also very good but also overpriced by about $3.00 per entree.

The only issue is the bread is sometimes hard, but it's also french bread and you can usually bring it up to them and they'll do something to make it right. The entire wait staff is a dream, they're punctuational, and invested. The management is nice. The to-go window is always staffed and online orders are punctuational and work well. I've been happy with every visit and plan on returning often, it's sort of my local go to place, with service and food that's actually quite better than J Alex next door to it.

Mushroom, Sausage, Pepperoni Pizza Nontraditional Cheese Pizza Spaghetti Bolognese Spaghettini with Asparagus Sicilian Pizza Veggie Pizza (w/ Goat Cheese) One thing to note, sharing a single pizza with two people probably isn't going to work out that well and for the longest time was one of the reasons I didn't like CPK, after I figured a pizza is sort of almost a single portion (with some togo), it became infinitely more enjoyable. The pizzas are a big bigger than a single portion, you'll probably want a bit more than half unless you start with a salad. I'd say consider .75 pizzas per person.

Jason R.,"Peachtree Corners, United States",13,27,,2.0,18/12/2017,"There seems to be an unspoken competition at the Forum restaurants as to which can be the worst in customer service.   Mambo Italiano has basically driven everyone in the neighborhood out years ago (how do they stay in business??), Ted's doesn't bother to even seat you anymore (bravo...), but CPK is racing up the line to become the most frustrating. We used to LOVE CPK.  We enjoy the food very much, and come in to get some of our 'regular' favorites.   The last few visits, though, have soured us on repeat visits altogether.     To say the staff is inattentive would be putting it mildly.   We come in, get seated (hey! CPK's already wayyyy ahead of Ted's Montana Grill at the Forum by this standard -- kudos!).   But then, we just sit...and sit...and sit...watching while 6-7 wait staff at CPK walk around.  No one stops by our table, but half huddle by a table in a corner (presumably on break..OK) while another few proceed to walk by the table again.  And again.    Finally, after 15 minutes someone (Martino, I believe, by our check after the meal finally made it to completion an hour or so later) stopped by for our drink order.   Another 10 minutes in and we got the drinks, but after dropping them off our server Martino immediately walks off.    It's another 15 minutes before he stops back by to take our order...so we'd been there **40 Minutes** by that time (we were ready to order when he stopped by to take our drink order but he left before we could even give it....). Starving by that point, we luckily got some bread with olive oil.  By that point, we were so hungry that bread  .   By the time we finally got our food order in, things seemed to be back on track.  Our trusty server Martino, was typically nowhere to be seen.    But, honestly, by the time we got the food ...it was good.   We have no problem with the food at all...but the service...Jeeeeeesh.  CPK managers, we're not difficult customers.  We're not expecting a 5-star dining experience but please, PLEASE, ask the too-cool-for-school staff to at least TRY to care.     The apathy is pretty evident.   40 minutes for a food order is juuuuuuuuust a bit much.      It's really a shame because this trend is only in the last year.  Prior years we always had a great experience -- with friendly staff and great food.   I don't think having someone stop by and take orders in a bit more timely manner is out of the norm.   Maybe we just came at a poor time (late afternoon), but it's been a similar trend on all recent visits this year (we had been stopping by once a week or every two weeks for some time).    With the non-existent service, it's a Hard Pass on CPK from this point forward.   The area is surrounded by restaurants. There's no reason to sit and wait (and wait) when you're going out to eat.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross

I'm not sure if they changed the peanut sauce or what has changed about this pizza but it was NOT as flavorful as I remember. Maybe because they were very chintzy with the sauce so that it was a tad on the dry side and more chicken could have been on it for that price point.

The pizza was pretty good though. We also got a quac and nacho starter ($5). If you sign up for their rewards program you get a free stater. It was just average tasting. They bring out some bread and olive oil as a complimentary starter. It's a nice touch but can be a carb overload if you eat that and a pizza. The interior was nice, very modern and clean. It's a large location so they can fit most parties. The hostess was very friendly and nice. Our waitress was nice but we hardly saw her again. The service could be improved upon.

Tuong Vi P.,"Atlanta, United States",133,759,2206,3.0,15/9/2014,"The food is not mind-blowing here at CPK, but I will throw in that this place is consistent. I have eaten at this location a few times over the years and have never experienced bad food or service. Since I have branched out and discovered what amazing culinary gems call Atlanta and its metro area home, it is hard to want to go back to eating at chains. However, I went quite recently because my youngest sister has just started working somewhat nearby and we decided that CPK would be safe for lunch. I met her on a weekday right around noon and was shocked that there were many booths and tables free. I guess maybe The Forum area is not absolutely flooded with office workers? Anyway, I got seated quickly by the nice hostess even though my sister was not yet in my company. I got a booth and our server brought waters as I waited for baby sis. She came in shortly thereafter and we considered the special that the server informed us of, which was signing up for something and getting a free (small) tapas plate. Ummm, we didn't even know what it was but free was attractive and what with spam folders and unsubscribe options available, we gave them everything short of our social security numbers. (See why there needs to be a Cheapskate badge?!?!) We ended up with several small plates for sharing: Spicy Fennel Sausage + Poblano Flatbread, White Corn Guacamole + Chips, Crispy Mac 'n Cheese, and the Spicy Chicken Tinga Quesadilla. Everything was quite good. Service was attentive without being pushy. My sister and I really enjoyed picking off the small plates and my favorites were the White Corn Guac and the Chicken Quesadilla, though that is not to say that I did not like the other items. The food here does not blow me away, as even the more creative dishes are tame and aimed at appealing to a wide crowd. But appeal they do and this is probably my favorite chain restaurant. I have no qualms eating at a CPK when unadventurous people accompany for a meal, even if other great options surround the place, because I know that I will get consistently good food. I have eaten at various CPK locations over the years in different states and I am always pleased by my food.

Bryan L.,"Johns Creek, United States",92,158,126,3.0,19/5/2014,"TL;DR: Atmosphere was very cozy with the gas-fired oven, and most of the pizzas I tasted were dry and lacked flavor. The original BBQ chicken pizza was the exception, and was really tasty and surely recommend it. When you first walk in, you notice the dimly lit room and the gas-fire oven in the back. It's a really cozy atmosphere, and seems perfect for a dinner date with your significant other. I was with a group, so they set up 3 tables just for us. The restaurant felt like a suspended sunset, and most of the decor and lampshades were warm colors and felt very intimate. The attire felt semi-formal: it was kind of casual but then again it's higher than fast food restaurants. You have to remember that CPK is a chain restaurant, but sometimes it doesn't feel like one.  Customer service was good and didn't find any complaints. We went on a Monday evening so it wasn't very busy and the waitresses arrived about 3 minutes after I sat down. They help recommend a few items from the menu and were very courteous.  Most of the pizzas on the menu ranged from $10-$15, while the appetizers were under $10. One pizza can easily serve two individuals, but I would recommend buying two different ones to share with. They also offer tacos, pastas and other side dishes, but I only ordered pizza. CPK offers complementary bread after you order, which I believe was sourdough bread which you can dip in olive oil and herbs.  I've tried the following: Original BBQ Chicken Pizza (hand tossed) - chicken, red onion, cilantro, bbq sauce Sicilian Pizza (thin crust) - salami, Italian sausage, parmesan, oregano, gouda  California Club Pizza (hand tossed) - arugala, basil, romaine, avocado, mozzarella, tomatoes, bacon (Complementary bread) The BBQ chicken pizza was by far the best that I tried. It was a mid-sized pizza, divided into six slices, and it would've been enough for me. The chicken surprisingly was juicy, and the bbq sauce compliments the pizza really well. I was doubtful at first about the bbq sauce + pizza combo, but somehow it worked. The bbq sauce had a sweet, tangy note, and was a pleasure to eat. The red onions on the pizza paired nicely with the chicken. It also was a bit sweet, and gave you a bit of a kick when you bit into the pizza. The cilantro brought everything together, giving the pizza a fresh flavor and didn't make me want to hit the gym afterwards. The crust however was pretty dry, but I didn't expect much about that. Overall the pizza was really nice, and I recommend getting it if you do come here. I think this was the pizza that got them famous, and it still is a must-have on the menu.  The other two pizzas, however, were disappointing. I was expecting a lot from the Sicilian pizza, but it was really dry. I liked the sliced salami and the ham, which were nice compliments to the pizza. The sausage tasted something from a fast-food pizza joint like Dominos, and I have no clue why they added it on. The pizza though was really bland and couldn't taste much.  The California Club pizza was worse. I don't have anything against eating healthy, but if you're going to a pizza restaurant, don't expect to enjoy a healthy pizza, because you ain't gonna' son. The California Club in simplest terms was a salad atop a pizza. The greens even had salad dressing, and my friend ate it with a fork like with a salad. The elements were not cohesive, and it was a fail attempt of a pizza. I could see it working, but each ingredient had a mind of its own. The avocado were in slices and had its own creamy note, the bacon was salty and dry, while the salad...had no flavor. Even when you pick up the pizza, all the greens atop just fall off and you're just left with a dry, salty bacon pizza. It was more like a Cali Clash than a Cali Club. Please don't try to order ""healthy"" items off menus. The bread I heard was hard and dry. I didn't try it, but everyone around me did. I know that I'm using  the word ""dry"" a lot, but they actually were. This restaurant got a lot of bad reviews, but it was okay. It's a chain restaurant anyways, and I didn't really expect much from it. There are better restaurants out there and I recommend going to a local restaurant than this for a date/event. But if you do decide to come here and order pizza, get the BBQ chicken pizza.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross

Yes it is a chain but not every  CPK is created equal since the staffs(chef, hostess, server) make up for 50% of the the total score of the experience. The staff here are friendly(most are high-school and college age so some are not very experienced but they're not terrible servers) and the food come out pretty fast.  I come here often to know that the food and service is pretty consistent. I have read over all of the reviews and the content is mostly positive but the reviewers give CPK a 2 or 3 stars....is it because it is not a fancy restaurant with tiny portions?  Anyways, let's get on with the food shall we? This is what I usually order every time:  BBQ chicken chopped- chop chicken, beans, corn, ranch dressing, crunchy tortilla strings drizzle with a light BBQ sauce...remember to add fresh avocado Avocado club egg rolls- this is my favorite it's like a tex-mex egg rolls with chicken and avocado and the dipping sauce is to die for Garlic chicken pizza- if you like garlic then you will love this...beside garlic is a great for your immune system Enjoy and remember do not judge a restaurant just because it's a chain.

If the restaurant is busy that's totally understandable, but it's been like this during off-hours, too. As for food--Their complimentary sourdough bread has consistently been rock-hard, which is kind of a shame 'cos I like the taste. The pizzas (The Works, veggie, BBQ, mupsa) are all pretty good, though--I haven't really tried one that I didn't like. Mupsa's my favorite, so far! Much better (though slower) than Domino's, for sure.  I've mentioned some cons, but I really do enjoy CPK all-in-all. If you're like me and you don't mind waiting a little while to get your food, I'd recommend this place. :)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross?start=40
Aubrey C.,"Duluth, United States",5,16,19,3.0,24/6/2009,"""Nice Decor, very mod, very hip"". I have to remind myself of this every time I crack open the menu at CPK and look at the prices. The Pizza's are good but why do you have to pay an additional $1.50 for thin crust ?  Less dough should equal less dough; right ? I guess more people are ordering thin crust so they might as well pry another $1.50 per pie out of your wallet. If money is no object go ahead and order soft drinks for the entire family for a family of 6 this will only set you back about $15.00.   The other items on the menu are also very good but also overpriced by about $3.00 per entree. If you want to have a good meal in an enjoyable atmosphere and don't mind paying a premium for it CPK is a good choice.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross?start=40
Jai R.,"Atlanta, United States",252,338,159,3.0,3/1/2012,"Being that this is a franchise all you can really hope for is excellent customer service.  The food is usually standard at all CPK's.  I always order my usual Meat Lovers, Jamaican Jerk or Hawaiian pizza.  The best salad is the BBQ chicken salad which I love to part-take in! This specific location has great hospitality and are pretty fast with the food.  This was my second visit to this location and I was very pleased with how quickly we were seated, the friendliness of our waiter and the prompt delivery of our food.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross?start=40
Kate G.,"Lawrenceville, United States",106,4,1,1.0,14/10/2014,"Came in today with a party of 12. Once there hostess said it would take 20 minutes after waiting 25 minutes I then went to the hostess and asked her how much longer and she said 45 minutes. So then after when leaving she came running outside with a tone that was not not very friendly and she kept telling me repeatedly that she was going to seat me shortly but told her I didn't want to eat her that they need to be more accurate on times and then walked away after that she she said ""bitch say it to my face"" as we were the only group of people I could only assume it was to me and then walked inside asking for store manager and she got into my face saying I was talking ""shit"" about her in Spanish and that I needed to say it to her face keep in mind she's a hostess she is the first face we see when we walk into the restaurant, when I asked her for general manager she said ""you can go get him he's in the back"" and I said no no YOU need to get him, and then she started yelling in front of everyone in the restaurant saying I was speaking Spanish and talking about her and clearly I am American and speak only one language which is English. Then store manager came and told her to go to the back but I did get the general managers number because no issue was resolved.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross?start=40
john r.,"San Francisco, United States",0,89,,5.0,8/5/2015,"I am not usually a fan of chain restaurants, but this CPK is surprisingly good. The salads are tasty (particularly the roasted veggie salad), portions are good, and unlike a few of the reviewers below I find the pizzas to be quite good. I have had several of the pizzas w/several crusts and always come back to the wild mushroom pizza with whole wheat crust. I agree the service is average, but that is what I expect (unfortunately) in a chain restaurant.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross?start=40
Cassie H.,"Norcross, United States",0,8,,2.0,2/5/2013,"I would only come here if you are out of all other choices in the Forum/ Peachtree Corners area. I live in this area and we only go there when everywhere else is too crowded or if we forget that the frozen version of their food is better. Service is terrible. We felt so bad for our waiter because he was in charge of most of the tables with the rest of the staff rolling their eyes, walking around aimlessly, texting, etc.  Our food order came out wrong and took about 30 min later than expected.  Again, only go if you have to. Their frozen pizza is better.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross?start=40

My office is right down the street, so when I was trying to find another place to order from for a team meeting, I gave them a try. It ended up being so expensive, which I would not have minded if my order was correct, but it was not!! I had to go back to the restaurant to get the itemes they left off!! Tried them again the week of Christmas, but this time we went there to eat. There were only 4 of us, but we ended up being there almost 2hrs and the place was half empty!! Our waitress was nice, but I think it might have been her first day of working, EVER!! We had to repeatedly ask her our beverages, silverware and the rest of out food. Every-time , she would say ""sure, be right back"" and then not come back for 10 min's.

Silence R.,"Atlanta, United States",2,27,,1.0,21/5/2013,"The service was absolutely unacceptable.  We were seated and maybe five to seven minutes later another couple was seated behind us. It was a solid ten minutes before our server appeared to take our drink order; we ordered food at the same time as it had taken a while for the server to appear in the first place.  Our drinks came, but in the meantime, the table behind us (with a different server) placed their drink order, received their drinks, placed their food order, AND received their food while our glasses remained empty on the table.  Our server did not make another appearance before we walked out.  What in the world?! They weren't busy. And I realize servers have limited control over how fast the food is prepared, but taking drink orders, bringing them to the table, and refilling empty glasses seems entirely within their purview. And if it's not, they may be in the wrong field.  The menu looked good online; too bad I'm not rating pictures.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross?start=40
Priya C.,"Duluth, United States",5,9,,1.0,5/6/2014,The quality has gone down. My Thai crunch salad had stale rice noodles. And my sisters tostada pizza tasted like it had been made hrs before and it was just nuked. Not happy,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross?start=40
Karen J.,"New York, United States",30,201,,3.0,1/7/2009,I have always enjoyed CPK but then again I love me some pizza. The only problem I have is trying to decide which pizza to get when! I tried the Thai Chicken pizza this time but my usual choice is the Rosemary Chicken and Potato one. My friend tried one of their pasta dishes and couldn't say enough good things about it.  This is just a good place to go if you want a wide variety of entrees and enjoy creative pizzas.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross?start=40
Daniel B.,"Atlanta, United States",2878,2878,40916,2.0,23/9/2010,"All CPKs are pretty much the same and this one is no exception.  This CPK is located at the Forum on Peachtree Parkway in Norcross.  I like how the pizzas at CPK are personally sized.  I tried the Sicilian pizza, which is one of a handful of pizzas they make with a thin crust (although you can request any pizza here be made thin crust at an additional cost).  Toppings on the Sicilian include sausage, ham, and salami with Fontina, Parmesan, and mozzarella cheese.  The pizza was nice and crispy and I liked it.  I also tried one of their ""new"" Cranberry Coolers.  It was just soda water mixed with cranberry juice.  Not something I'd order again.  Service was not so good.  The server for our section forgot about us and a server from another section noticed and tried to help us out.  When the server for our section realized he'd forgotten about us, he apologized and blamed it on our booth being set apart from most of the tables in his section.  My friend aptly called it the ""no man's land.""  I've always found the prices at CPK to be a little high for what you actually get, but it's not surprising at most casual dining chains such as this.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross?start=40

Lindsay S.,"Athens, United States",73,282,26,4.0,8/4/2011,"I've eaten at California Pizza Kitchen one other time at their location beside North Point mall and was honestly less than impressed.  I walked into this location in The Forum off Peachtree Parkway not expecting much but was pleasantly suprised.  The decor is rather modern and upscale for a pizza joint which provides for a comfortable dining experience.  It was lunch hour and I thought we would have a long wait but we were seated immediately and in a comfortable booth!  Our waiter was probably the highlight of the meal not afraid to engage in a little conversation and was an expert at answering all my questions about the food (because I can be quite picky after all).  The moment of truth was when my Waldorf Chicken Salad graced my table I was thrilled the lettuce was fresh, the grapes and apples were juicy, and the bleu cheese topping was a nice touch.  Oh but wait my fellow Yelp lovers, I ordered a cheese pizza as well.  My cheese pizza arrived at our table piping hot and covered in delicious cheese.  The breading was sweet and the tomatoes tasted fresh not my favorite pizza ever (don't worry Dominio's!!) but I enjoyed it.  Bobby got the Asian Tacos which he said were extremely delicious and he especially enjoyed the spicy asian inspired sauce.  Just a tip the parking is great you can park right outside the door to the restaurant without having to deal with busy forum shoppers.  I had a good experience and I will definitely be going back for lunch again soon!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross?start=60
Julia S.,"Norcross, United States",2,19,20,2.0,19/5/2011,"I come here a couple of times because of the location and my friends enjoy it. But probably 4 out of the 5 times I've experienced awful service. The first time I came was for my birthday celebration with a large group of friends. I went about 20 minutes early (recommended by an employee when I called in) because they have a no reservations policy. As soon as I walked in, the manager told me I would have a table waiting for me. But then when he walked away, the hostess told me they had to give it away if my party did not show up within the next few minutes. I was pretty upset but then once I spoke to the manager, things were fine again. When we were seated, the waitress we had was pretty rude and we even found her to be a little racist. Plus, the food came out slow and wasn't too great anyway. I gave CPK a couple tries after that, but clearly my experiences there haven't worked out too well. Because of this restaurant, I've realized the quality of service makes a huge impact on the overall experience. I wouldn't go there again.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross?start=60
