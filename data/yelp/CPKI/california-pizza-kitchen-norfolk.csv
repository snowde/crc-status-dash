Kimberly P.,"Chesapeake, VA",193,339,670,5.0,8/24/2017,"I really hate paying over $10 dollars for a salad when pizza and pasta are the stars on the menu. But their roasted veggie salad was fresh, filling (and only 380 calories),  and gave me so much life! I was torn between ordering the full or half, but I was reassured that I the half would be plenty, and it was. It comes with warm artichoke hearts, asparagus, eggplant, red & yellow peppers, corn and sun-dried tomatoes served over Romaine with avocado and Dijon balsamic vinaigrette.  After eating this I tapped into the mindset of Vegans, despite it not having any meat, I didn't miss it.... but I'm definitely not giving it up though #MeatIsBae. Despite not being the biggest fan of chain restaurants, I will definitely keep this as an option when I'm craving a good salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norfolk
Yajaida P.,"Norfolk, VA",80,325,863,2.0,11/11/2017,"This last trip featured a forgotten appetizer, the wrong entree, an inedible salad and a check that took entirely too long. It's like I have selective memory when it comes to this specific CPK. Every time, every single time, I leave regretting that I came. The Hawaiian pizza this trip was okay, a little undercooked, a lotta underwhelming. The Thai salad I just sent back. The lettuce had turned and even if that wasn't the case, there wasn't any other redeeming aspect. Even the dressing tasted rancid. I think I'm finally done giving them the benefit of the doubt. About half the time a pizza turns out ok, but that's just not enough. Jeff was so frustrated, he abandoned any hope of getting the waitress back and just left cash on the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norfolk
Rose M.,"Chesapeake, VA",72,201,1306,5.0,8/20/2017,"I have been past this restaurant and to the mall several times but never stopped before. My kids received 2 free kids pizzas so that was a perfect time to try this place out.  I looked over the whole menu and it was more then just pizza.  I stuck with the lunch menu for my first time.   My little ones ordered their cheese only pizzas and surprisingly one child ate the entire thing.  Ahem he is 4!!!! The other child complimented the pizza and she liked the crust.  She may not have eaten the whole thing because it's a girl thing.     My teen ordered a chicken club with a Mediterranean salad.  She liked all of it and helped her sister with her pizza and 2 slices of mine.  If your in search of how to reduce food waste come see me.  I order the spinach and mushroom pizza with potatoe soup.  I was just going to stick with a traditional pepperoni but my waitress convinced me if I liked spinach it was a good choice. I'm glad I tried it.  It was good.  I can get pepperoni anywhere anytime!    We had a great seat in the back in a booth next to the door to the patio.  It was a late lunch around 2 but there were probably about 10 tables filled.  Our server was nice and direct.  I tried to joke with her but she didn't really joke back.  She filled our drinks and check on us.  Restaurant was clean as was the restrooms.  Plenty of seating to include a bar area, booths and tables.  Takeout service is available too.   We would go back to sample something else.  The food was good, hot and fresh.  We also missed out on dessert so I guess that's a definite yes we will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norfolk

Jon C.,"Lutherville-Timonium, MD",46,8,12,5.0,1/1/2018,"I went here with my family when my mom got a coupon for her birthday. It was very crowded, but the noise was still at a fairly low level.the setting itself was solid, and the service was pretty good. We ordered three pizzas, a shrimp scampi one, a pepperoni one, and a margherita one (thin crust). The pizzas arrived very fast, especially considering that the restaurant was packed. Both of the regular pizzas were about 12"", and the thin crust pizza was around 14"". I tried both the pepperoni and the margherita, and I really liked both of them. My parents liked the shrimp scampi, but the shrimp was a little undercooked. Overall, the experience was satisfactory, and while I would rate their pizza below Fellini's, Cogan's, the Bakehouse, and Del Vecchio's, I would still return to eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norfolk

Nichole S.,"Virginia Beach, VA",205,63,627,5.0,8/15/2017,"Let me start by saying that i never, and I mean never sit down at a restaurant for pizza. My usual motto is, of course, why leave my house when it could come to me? Wrong! This experience has totally changed my opinion on pizza. The Pizza was delicious. It was piping hot and the ingredients seemed to be fresh which was better than any pizza that I'd usually eat. To top it off, the ambiance was great. You, depending on your seat, get a full view of the oven and the bar and a view of the city as well. Our waitress Anita was kind and answered any questions that we had.

Christian S.,"Norfolk, VA",49,216,16,4.0,11/6/2017,"Had lunch today (11/6/17) at CPK in MacArthur Center. Ordered off the lunch menu and got the split pea and barley soup and Mediterranean salad. Server also brought over a baguette and oil. I wanted to order the farmer's soup but they do not carry that this time of year (server said menus need update). The manager, Mike, came over and chatted with us for a little while. He was super friendly and it was much more than the standard ""hey, how's everything"" conversation. The soup and salad was plenty to fill me up for lunch. Server attempted an upsell for dessert but I skipped it.

Drina R.,"Virginia Beach, VA",66,15,117,2.0,10/13/2017,"Well, I guess my only complaint was the waiter wasn't very knowledgeable of what they can or can not do to modify my chicken lettuce wraps. I specifically asked if I could just have the chicken and scallions with ginger sauce, minus the water chestnuts and mushrooms and his response was, ""no, it's all mixed together"". The answer should have been, let me check for you. So with that being said, I asked to speak with the manger and of course he stated, ""sure, were can do that for you"". Needless to say, I got what I asked for, but the chicken was fried extremely hard, and was very dry. I've ordered these chicken lettuce wraps in the past, and they were good.

Gabrielle D.,"Virginia Beach, VA",313,130,520,3.0,6/18/2016,"Came to the CPK located inside MacArthur mall for my parent's 25th anniversary last night. Honestly, im not into CPK's food in general because it's very hit or miss. I don't dislike CPK. It's just not my favorite. However, I've never ever had a problem with their service. In fact, our server last night was exceptional. She was very pleasant, patient and upbeat.  Like I've said, my parents really like CPK so we do come here often. That being said, I knew what I liked and what I don't. I LOVE pasta but the only pasta I really like here is their salmon/asparagus/spinach spaghettini. I think it's perfect. It's garlicky, fresh, and delicious. I've had their jambalaya pasta in the past but when I had it, I felt as if their meat to pasta ratio was so unbalanced. But when I say I love pasta ... I mean it and it always bothers me whenever there's more meat than pasta. My family also ordered the shrimp and chicken lettuce wrap which you can't go wrong with. There was four of us and four lettuce wraps so it was the perfect app to share.  I know CPK is all about their pizzas (I mean it's in the name lol) but the only pizza I really like there is the Margherita pizza. In the past, Ive always felt as if you can't go wrong with it. My family ordered two different kinds last night but unfortunately they were both dry. I usually enjoy their Margherita pizza but last night it was just eh ..  Can't really bash though bc the service was great and is always great and I already know I'm not into CPK much. It's a nice place to have lunch though if you're at MacArthur mall and the area is super nice",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norfolk
Adam L.,"Rock Hill, SC",86,179,32,4.0,7/24/2016,"Wife had never been to a CPK. She started with the strawberry mango cooler to drink.  We both really were impressed with how tasty and refreshing it was.  It is made with Fresca which if you don't know is a zero calorie beverage so it's not as unhealthy and sugary as some specialty drinks.  At $3 we were pleased.  Sign up for their email and get a coupon for free shall plate. We got the fried mac-n-cheese. Wife loved them but I want too impressed.  I thought they were a little greasy and bland.  We then got club and avocado egg rolls. These tasted great but 3 egg rolls for a little over $10 seems steep.  We shared the California club pizza and it was fantastic.  Crust was really awesome. Topped with arugula and romaine, tomatoes,  and avocado dressed with a lemony dressing. Let me tell you....the bacon they use,  Nueske's (or something like that) is really a game changer.  It is so good.  This bacon is not grocery store bacon....go online and search...you're talking $12-$15 a pound.  That is really great ingredients for a casual place.

I come here a lot for lunch, but sometimes it takes so long that we have to take our food to go. The lunch deals are really good because of all the options (half sandwich half salad or soup or pizza and salad). I can't get enough of the lettuce wraps and salads. I was craving a ceaser salad and when my plate came I could barely hold out long enough to snap a picture. The salmon is an extra $5 but they add alot and it is cooked to perfection which makes it worth the extra coins.

J David H.,"Virginia Beach, VA",757,1095,19946,4.0,7/31/2015,"I have been coming to this location for years, but it has been quite a while since my last visit. However, I was thrilled to see long time manager Michael is still in charge and keeps his customers happy. The front area was clean and I also found the restrooms to be clean on my visit. I stopped in for a late weekday lunch with my daughter and was promptly waited on by the hostess and led to our table by one of the runners. Our waitress Abbie promptly got drinks and bread going and was strong the entire time. Drinks and bread delivered in a timely manner. A missed opportunity to not ask for butter for the bread which my daughter needed. However, Abby got it taken care of quickly. Another missed opportunity was to clear the table of dishes during our service. My daughter got the kids peperoni pizza which was delicious and give enough to take a few slices home. I got my usual fish tacos with side of chips and salsa. It is a very filling and scrumptious as usual. Service remained very good, but my water did hit the danger zone of almost empty and I did have to ask for a refill. I also wanted to take the time to comment on the dining room. I did not see a single table that was not occupied not cleared off. The floors were clear of debris as well. Everything presented in a professional manner and I was impressed. The restaurant manger Michael came over and asked us how our food was. I was happy to share with him that it was excellent and that his server did a great job, but did discuss some missed opportunities. He discussed a new valet program to park on Monticello Ave. and then get a stub from a server to provide the valet service. Don't forget to tip them, they don't work for FREE!

Natalie R.,"Virginia Beach, VA",1,147,5,3.0,11/23/2014,"CPK is one of the few decent places to eat at MacArthur Center. This place is average in service and quality. They have started serving small plates for those who want only a quick bite, but to me the food is always too salty. If you are looking for a cocktail, then this place is decent for that.  My last visit I went with a larger group of 6. We were situated back to back, and I mean chairs touching, between other four tops. There was so little room to move. I do think they need to reconfigure the seating, as they are trying to cram as many people as they can into the dining room.

Kelly F.,"Chesapeake, VA",0,5,,1.0,1/20/2016,"This one was a doozie.  This restaurant doesn't even deserve one star.  I went with a couple people in December to CPK and we had a nice time, drinks were great and food was good, service also. So the next time we were in MacArthur to go to the movies, we decided to go there again, this time it was just me and my boyfriend. We were seated in the back, near the emergency exit door. We were having a nice time, our server Alen was AWESOME, he's a really nice person, food and drinks were exactly as ordered and came in good timing (I had been in the F&B industry for four years, so I know how it goes). Then it all came to a screeching hault. A very tall man walked up to our table and started asking us for ""anything that we had"". I seriously thought this was a joke, or a hidden camera thing, so I kind of blew it off, expecting this man to go away. But after being at the table for at least two minutes, I had just had enough. I walked up to a server's counter to wait another minute for someone to talk to. I looked around to see that other servers had noticed the man at the table, yet no one did ANYTHING! I looked back at the table to find this man sitting where I had been seated, eating my boyfriend's pizza.  I waited for someone to talk to, then someone went to ""find a manager"". It also blows my mind that on a Friday night, probably around 7:30, there was no manager on the floor, but hidden away in her back office. The manager came out and asked what was happening then walked to the table as the man was leaving. I sat back down and found an eaten pizza crust on my plate of food. My boyfriend said that he kept on badgering him to give him food and money, and when my boyfriend said that he had no money, he started getting angry. This is a very dangerous situation to let happen. The manager offered us a dessert when she was at the table, and we declined. Then our server came back with the check. It was a full check, laid out on the table. I was a little shocked, as I have handed out fully comped checks for things that happened that were not nearly this serious. We both stared at the check. Alen came back to the table and I asked to see the manager again. She didn't come to the table and after about 5 minutes I got up again to see if the manager was anywhere, but yet again, she was in the back, not on the floor. She came out, talked to a couple other servers and then came to talk to me. I asked her if the bill was serious, if she was really expecting us to pay the full amount after our dinner was ruined by poor management. She said she was working on comping the bill, but didn't have a new bill. She then printed out a bill that was only for the drinks, and I asked if that was for legal reasons, and she said yes. I understand that, but also know that drinks can be comped in situations like this. She then took the bill and said ""well you both said that you didn't want dessert and that you were fine"". I found that breath-taking, that she was now turning the problem around on us. My boyfriend then came up and said something, and then she said ""yes, you both should be my first priority,"" giving blame to herself over the fact that we had not been her first priority. She asked us that we just take care of our server, which we did in the form of a 33% tip, and we also took care of the man that begged us for food and money. We left the bill with her, handed Alen cash, and left. A hostess followed us out of the restaurant with movie passes, which was super cool.  But this situation was dangerous and ruined a night out, something that we usually don't do. We're all for helping people out, but on nights that we're treating ourselves, we don't want to be approached in a closed environment.  And on top of this, while at work on monday, my boyfriend was telling the story to his co-workers, and found out that the same man had approached someone else at the neighboring restaurant, Texas-De-Brazil. This is obviously a bigger problem that mall security has to deal with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norfolk?start=60
Jonathan H.,"San Diego, CA",416,327,1006,3.0,4/5/2010,"This is my first CPK experience outside of California or Hawaii. I must say, it was pretty good. The inside is pretty huge, with lots of different places to sit. One of the spots in the back even has a booth with a mirror behind it so you can nonchalantly people-watch on the entire customer base without anyone knowing, unless they look back at you.  I got the Mediterranean sampler that had hummus, pita bread and some minced veggies. It was rockin'. So then I ordered the staple Jamaican jerk chicken pizza. This jerk of a pizza came out and it basically stared me down until I ate the whole thing. Something about the sauce combined with the chicken is so amazing I could drink it from a fire hose and still ask for seconds.  The only debbie-downer was the place definitely had the kitschy feel of a chain restaurant (which it is), without trying to change it up at all.

Pete N.,"Chesapeake, VA",12,9,4,3.0,6/4/2014,"I am giving California Pizza Kitchen three stars more because of my personal preferences, not becuase of anything that they do wrong. It's me, not them. I acknowledge that. I tend to like more causal dining experiences, and while I wouldn't say that this is a formal place, it's not as casual as I like it. The pizza is ok, I have not tried anything that I would write home about. My wife loves it, and they have a nice selection of beer, which is why it is a three star rating instead of a two star rating. The service has always been fine, our waitress this time wasn't bad, but wasn't great. She knew a lot about beer, which is a plus for me, but she didn't wow us. Overall, it's solid if you are looking for a nice dining experience, maybe a first date type situation. Also, probably not the best place if you have young kids. It's more quiet than most restaurants, and if your kids are loud and destructive (like mine), then it just wouldn't work out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norfolk?start=60

Our server was MIA the entire meal. Another server took our order, and yet a  different server brought it out much later. Oh yeah, and um...appetizers are supposed to comes BEFORE the entrée.  We asked to speak to a manager, and got one...20 minutes later. I don't care how big your lunch slam is....get a grip people.  When I pay $20 for a salad and an Ice Tea, I want some service to go along with that.

Zachary G.,"Yorktown, VA",0,13,,1.0,6/7/2010,"Ate here with a friend a few months ago, my friend having ate at a CPK before (not this location) and it being my first time at one. We got there around 8 PM and at least half of the tables were empty yet our food took a frustratingly long time to arrive. I had ordered the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Pizza after seeing all the little menu cards advertising it and bragging about how it won some sort of contest. When it arrived I noticed something right away: It was missing the pineapple. I had received a normal BBQ chicken pizza and not the ""Hawaiian"" version which from what I could tell only added some pineapple. Our waiter took it back and came back 5 minutes later with what seemed to be the same pizza but with some room temperature pineapple tossed on top of it (seemingly canned). From what I remember, this is against health codes in most (if not all) states but I was starving and didn't feel like waiting another 30 minutes for my order to be redone. So I finally start to eat my long-awaited pizza (which wasn't very hot at that point) to find out it was sickeningly sweet and tasted more like a dessert than anything else. I like my BBQ sauce sweet but this was even sweeter than Sweet Baby Ray's and was hardly edible. Still starving, I managed to eat half of the pizza before requesting a refund due to shoddy service, health code violations (which I didn't mention), and bad food. The staff/manager must've been tired since I received no real argument and got the money back for both my pizza and my friend's salad (which was ""ok"").

Chel R.,"Kill Devil Hills, NC",279,354,438,3.0,7/12/2010,"While this is a chain restaurant, it's worth a review because it's one of the few good options in MacArthur Mall for dining. I am mixed on the review a bit, giving it 3 stars mainly because the service is bad. Food - 4 stars  The menu is fantastic. They have a lot of great pizza concoctions. I love the gorgonzola pear pizza topped with hazelnuts (yes, if there is a hazelnut on any menu in Hampton Roads, I'm on it!). The Neapolitan pizzas are wonderful. The thin crust is amazing. You can make any pizza Neopolitan but I prefer just the plain five cheese so you can truly enjoy all the simple flavor. The non-pizza dishes are great too. I've had their salads and soups on days when I want to eat a little lighter.  But, I have to say, CPK has the suckiest free bread I've ever had at a restaurant. And this isn't a one time thing. It's every time I've been to any CPK. The bread is so dry and stale it's like cardboard. No amount of butter in the world could make that bread tasty. Seriously, what are they thinking? Service -2 stars You will wait a very long time for your food, especially during the busy lunch crowd. You will get so hungry you might even consider trying a bite of that nasty bread. Don't do it. As slow as they are, that bread won't help things. Finally, when you get your meal, go ahead and ask for the check and a to-go box.

The roasted garlic and chicken was cooked to perfection. The chicken was cubed and cooked all the way through (always a positive in my book) and the mozzarella cheese was just enough to compliment the garlic to round the full flavor.

Kim K.,"Chesapeake, VA",140,159,50,4.0,1/30/2015,CPK is always a great place to get a nice variety. The mushroom pizza with truffle oil was sinfully good. The salad with pear is also very tasty! I suggest going with a friend and sharing both.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norfolk?start=20
John K.,"Virginia Beach, VA",83,264,60,4.0,12/21/2015,"2 Saturdays to Christmas and it was busy, that did not detract from the service or the food our ""tea time"" stop they have local craft beer on tap and make a decent drink! The pizza from previous visits were on point, this time we tried the guacamole with fresh chips and an egg roll appetizer. Both came out quickly with accompanying sauces and both were tasty and filling. The bar faces the pizza kitchen so you get a show off the pizzas being made and the parade of food all looked amazing. Makes for a good pit stop at Mac Mall!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norfolk?start=20
Paul T.,"Virginia Beach, VA",157,368,163,4.0,9/10/2013,"CPK as the cool kids call it, is the go to place for ""Casual Business Lunch"".  For a few reasons.  First, you're going to get gobs of time to talk business because, well, the place is slow.  Seriously, if you're looking for a zippy lunch, move on.   Secondly, the acoustics make eavesdropping on nearby tables more difficult than what I'm typically used to.  Honestly, we were seated very close to another party of six and I didn't hear a word. Third, they offer a VERY diverse menu that will appease the vegetarians, the weight conscious and the people that just wont to stuff themselves with Pizza.   On to the food, if you're a salad person, there's a good chance that the half-salad will do ya.  They offer a wide varieties of options.  Next, of course, is the pizza, they offer a selection of ""Fancy Schmancy"" pizza options.  Don't come here expecting a big hot steaming pile of cheese and sauce.  This isn't a bad thing, I like occasionally having a big BLT pizza or a White pizza with bacon!  Yum. For the appetizers, I really like their lettuce wraps!  Avoid the fish tacos, they use the wrong lettuce on it and it just comes out REALLY bad.  Trust me. So ya, for business, CPK, pretty good for downtown Norfolk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norfolk?start=20
Alison M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",223,1111,3477,5.0,1/28/2012,"Have been here once before a long time ago and got the BLT pizza - which I thought was good.   Stopped here today with my husband while shopping at the mall and we LOVED everything.   We got the avocado chicken spring rolls as our starter and they were delicious.  Warm and fresh and fantastic with a ranch sauce and a spicy ranch for dipping. I got the half BBQ chicken salad and my husband got some carnitas tacos.  I tried his and they were delicious.  My salad was very good, my only complaint that the chicken was cold - I prefer mine to be warm on salads - but I suppose some places do it differently.  We finished with the butter cake with vanilla ice cream for dessert.  Our waitress convinced us to try it - I was more leaning toward the brownie sundae.  I'm glad we listened to her - that butter cake was amazing.  It was warm and gooey and covered with some crunchy sugar coating or something.  Sooo good.  I usually don't eat much dessert my husband eats about three fourths of it but I helped him eat almost half of it this time.  Throughout the whole ordeal we both commented on how fresh the ingredients were and how good everything was.   It was a pleasant experience and with one so close to home for us we'll be sure to visit the one in Virginia Beach next time we want to get out of the house for dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norfolk?start=20
Kenneth Patrick J.,"Reston, VA",254,241,164,5.0,11/3/2015,"My wife and I split a grilled veggie salad and a margarita pizza, both of which were delicious. The salad was amazing with the perfect balance of romaine, dressing, veggies and a light dressing. We will get that one again!!! The pizza was very good too and the leftovers were just as good cold. We had not been to CP for the longest time but we are so glad we rediscovered it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norfolk?start=40
Tracci J.,"Norfolk, VA",20,1,,2.0,4/7/2016,"Normally the chicken fettuccine is quite tasty.  Disappointed today.  Lunch took 30 minutes to come out,  it was so bland that no amount of salt, pepper or red pepper flakes could help",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norfolk?start=40
Rory J.,"Poulsbo, WA",116,276,56,4.0,3/13/2013,"Tip: Do not come here the night the Admirals are playing their arch rivals at home AND Jersey Boys is at the Chrysler.  Even with both of those things going on, we only wait about 30 minutes and with the mix of the two crowds, got some great people watching in. They handled the crowds with the smooth efficiency of G men, even down to the ear pieces to communicate impending vacancies at table 29.  CPK is CPK, it's all standardized, well made and focus grouped. I do like that they have a menu with all of the nutritional info on it. They also have healthy and vegan-y option, so it's good for crowds of diverse people.  We started with the baja chicken eggrolls and they were pretty good. They dressed them with fresh cilantro, which was a nice touch. They had a bit of spice, but not much.  I had the roasted veggie salad with salmon. I was surprised that the salmon came out chunked into the salad and not as a filet on top, but they, that's smart! They could have just charged me $5 for 2 ounces of salmon, how would I know?!  My husband had the thin crust meat lovers thing and it suited him pretty well. It was a good size and he had a couple slices to take home with him. I had a bite and thought it was pretty good.  I mean everything was pretty good. Nothing super original, nothing wrong with the service or food, but nothing that holds a candle to some of the Granby St. gems a block away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norfolk?start=40
Teressa L.,"Newcastle, WA",87,543,467,4.0,7/22/2013,"We haven't been here in awhile but I wanted that BBQ Chicken salad and pizza!   Apparently they have been pushing wine b/c every table had glasses on it, and some tables were literally covered in wine glasses b/c people weren't drinking it LOL!!!  Seems like less wine glasses everywhere would be better.... But our server was awesome, recommended some beers we might like and explained the menus.  Our water stayed full and our food came out quickly.  He checked on us often enough and was friendly but not intrusive.   As always the food was awesome.  We like it and will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norfolk?start=40
Geornae F.,"Norfolk, VA",195,13,8,5.0,7/5/2014,"CPK is never disappointing. Yesterday I ordered the Five cheese+Tomato add bacon. The pizza came out nice and hot, all five cheese and tomato comes together nicely, not one cheese is over powering another one. The added bacon was a nice meaty touch, it was just right amount of bacon. Our server was very attentive, and friendly. The hand tossed crust, was Delicious it was soft and buttery, it wasn't hard and inedible. I personally believe its the best pizza on the menu. The butter cake is to die for!!

Steph W.,"Portsmouth, VA",179,245,23,3.0,6/25/2013,"I can't believe I wasted my money on this place. I came here before the Daniel Tosh stand up. The service was slow, the pizza was not very good. I like thin crust and I got the Hawaiian pizza. Not impressed at all. The toppings tasted....off. I can't explain it but I didn't like it. The macaroni bites were good- they were like cheese curds.  For the price I paid, I rather eat somewhere good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norfolk?start=40
Mark D.,"Pacific Beach, San Diego, CA",222,428,155,4.0,7/17/2014,"Wonderful decor, friendly staff and great tasting gourmet pizza's are the constants at CPK. That said there are a few hiccups that have me debating whether it's a 3 Star or a 4 Star restaurant.  Service: We had an excellent server this time coupled with the no waiting for a table, which is usually 50/50 depending on how crowded it is at MacArthur Mall. Appetizers: I ordered the White Corn Guacamole and Chips as a starter and found the chips a little stale (which is a pet peeve of mine). The Guacamole could've used a little salt during its preparation, as it would've really helped bring out the flavors of the corn and avocado.   My wife had a better experience with the Petite Wedge Salad, which was a perfect size. I always felt wedge salads were a little on the large size for an appetizer but CPK seemed to get it right. The fresh bacon bits verses artificial really made a difference in flavor. However the sliced tomato cubes were to small for using a fork so you only could get any of their flavor when the cuts were caught up in the dressing. Other than the size of the salad it wasn't any different from any other wedge salad you'd find at any national chain restaurant. Meal: For dinner I ordered the Five Cheese and Tomato Pizza while my wife choose her favorite, The Original BBQ Chicken Pizza. Both were so dang good I'd have a hard time not ordering them on our next time back.  Wine Flights: I really enjoyed this addition, as I don't remember it on our last visit. The pours were good sized; the glasses spotless and choices pretty good. We tried the Adventure (or something like that) and it was great for our meal. Desert: We decided on the Butter Cake and found it quite delicious but could've used a few more minutes in room temperature before taking it from the frig to the table. Cleanliness: Overall this place is really clean. The tables, floor, restrooms and the kitchen prep area looked good (the prep area is open to the public in case you haven't been there). Overall: What CPK does well it does very well but what they miss on would only takes a few tweaks to get it up to the same par as the gourmet pizza's and our server. Although I thought I'd be having a 3 Star dinner when I walked in after taking everything into consideration I'm going with the 4 Star on this visit and update on my next time around as need be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norfolk?start=40
Ana P.,"Fort Belvoir, VA",132,156,402,3.0,5/12/2013,"I went here because my lovely neighbor raved about it and she eats very healthy. So we went for lunch and it was really good! We had for appetizers: the artichoke and spinach dip with blue corn chips and the Cannellini hummus with whole wheat pita bread which were delicious! The kids shared cheese pizza and I had the Pear and gorgonzola pizza that has a mixed salad on top. It was very nice but I didn't give it more stars because I love crunchy pizza and it was more like a warm flatbread or pita. I make pizza at home all the time and I MAKE sure it's thin and crunchy. My friend had a half portion salad and it was still huge and looked great! Other than that they have great salads, nice wine selection, the service is very good, nice atmosphere, trendy decor and they have healthy choices.

Even the manager was personable and truly interested when she asked ""how are you today"" .  The bartender, Eric, incredibly knowledgeable and accommodating! Again, never seemed that the "" how are you today"" was rhetorical!  CPK has always been a favorite of mine, unfortunately, the closest is an hour away.

Kelly S.,"Yorktown, VA",68,155,31,3.0,8/14/2014,"The pizza looked OK, but I got a salad. It was the California salad and was it over priced!  The combination of spinach and strawberries was good and I would get it again, but half a salad for $15? NO. My coworker got the strawberry shortcake and the shortcake was hard as a rock, with very little strawberries. The other coworker got a pizza that had grease pools on it from the pepperoni. Eww.

However, I must say that my experience this time around was far from average. The food was expertly prepared and delivered in a timely fashion by Jon...who was by far the best waiter I've had in recent memory.  This was truly a dining out delight, in a most unexpected locale.

I was really quite impressed with CPK.  They were offering free pizzas to veterans; that alone is good in my book.  But what struck me was the service and professionalism of the staff.  I'd say the vast majority of the patrons were there to redeem the veteran's day offer, and yet the staff remained cool and pleasant.  The quality of neither the food nor the service depreciated, despite the stress they must have been under.  I could see them working their tails off, yet they seemed to genuinely enjoy serving everyone present.  My hat's off to them.  I will definitely be back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norfolk?start=40
Victoria L.,"Brockton, MA",60,5,4,5.0,8/27/2015,"My boyfriend and I decided we wanted to go out to dinner last week after I got off work. We decided on CPK because we both loved it when we lived in Massachusetts. However, the food was terrible. Our pita and hummus appetizer was gross; the hummus was watery and the pita bread wasn't actual pita bread imo. The Thai Chicken pizza was undercooked and disgusting; I couldn't even stomach half a slice. The mac n cheese bites? Burnt and oily. I started to quietly complain to my boyfriend about it, since we're both rather shy and didn't want to cause any kind of trouble. But a waitress overheard me and sent the manager, I believe his name was either Evan or Nick, over to our table. He offered to have our mac n cheese bites remade, but took almost 30 minutes to do so. Our waitress came by and asked why we were still here, since we had already paid. We told her we were waiting on the manager. She went to get him, but it took 15 more minutes for him to come back. At this point, we were both furious and still very hungry. When he came back, we explained all the things wrong with our entire visit, to which he responded with a coupon for a free small dish. We didn't really want it. I wanted my money back and asked for it. He ended up giving us a $15 gift card, the free small dish coupon, and my money back. We shook his hand and left. Fast forward two days and we're hungry again after work. We decide, hey, let's go back since it's on them this time. Totally. Different. Experience. It was amazing! The manager periodically checked up on us and we ended up having such an amazing time. This time around we got a pepperoni pizza, the dumplings (BEST. THING. EVER!!!!), and this chocolate cake dessert. We both loved it, and have such a nice conversation with the manager. Our waiter this time was the absolute best, too. Very punctual and always made sure we had what we needed. Apparently the first time we went, things had been happening like that quite often. Our complaint ended up getting him to have an all staff meeting about the poor service and food. 5/5, even with the first experience.
