Lucy W.,"Highland Park, IL",1,21,,4.0,6/3/2013,"I too have been going to CPK since living in California.  The location in Northbrook has been hit or miss either with service or with food.  We dined last night and were pleasantly surprised with some of the changes and the quality of the food.  We signed up for the dough club and received a free small plate which we ordered the avocado and corn guac with chips.  The quality was great, the flavor was perfect and the only improvement could of been a few more chips on the plate.  They also asked if we wanted bread, which was a first and brought out a nice crusty bread with an olive oil with fresh herbs in it.  Fabulous!  This is something you would find in california but not in often in chicago so hats off for such a yummy addition!  We ordered a large caesar salad and margarite pizza and my son had tacos.  Everything was very tasty and came at the right temperature.  My only complaint was a few more fresh shavings of parmesean on the salad would of been nice, fresh pepper offered for the pizza and salad, and some serving utensils for the salad and the small plate.  otherwise, I am again a big fan of this restaurant.  And...our server was very nice and genuine and prompt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northbrook?start=60
Sharon K.,"Glenview, IL",9,5,,1.0,10/17/2010,"Long wait for food.  Too Expensive.  Pasta way undercooked even after we sent it back.

Alison V.,"Minooka, IL",763,579,549,5.0,9/3/2017,The best CPK I have ever been to.  We ordered a gluten-free margherita pizza and it was the best out of a dozen of California Pizza Kitchen locations I have tried in three states!  The crust was nice and crispy and it had the perfect amount of basil for a margherita pizza.  And Roman provided amazing service.

Yvonne G.,"San Jose, CA",22,8,,1.0,7/22/2017,"I love CPK, but today I went in for lunch on a Saturday. It wasn't too busy, but as time passed it started filling up. Me and my friend sat at the bar area and quickly got greeted and order our drinks by a very young guy. Then he came to take our food orders and after then it went down hill.  25 mins later he came by to tell us that he forgot to put in our food order and of course we were a little upset so we asked for a discount, but then the manager told us the best thing she could do is give us free dessert and we said yes. So the young man put our order in and our salad came first but then about 25 mins later passed by and we asked our server where our pizza was and he said he will check on it. Then the manager came by and said that the order didn't go through. They let us walk out without paying for our salad and drinks and to come in next time and she will get our pizza (didn't sound like that will be the case), but it sucked that that was our experience.  I felt like the manager was new and had no idea what she was doing. She was even trying to run food, but didn't even know where to take the food. My experience working in the food industry for 8 years and I thought the way things were handled could have been better.  It's unfortunate the way things were handled, because I know CPK usually has good service. I hope things can be handled in a different matter next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northbrook
Julia J.,"Columbus, OH",159,94,50,3.0,4/6/2017,"We came here around 8:20 on a weekday. The host wasn't very welcoming and we had to look for her to get seated when the restaurant was basically empty. I understood they closed at 9 so we tried to eat and order quickly. However, I definitely felt the pressure of the workers edging us to leave. We ended up leaving at 8:50.  My boyfriend and I really enjoyed the buffalo cauliflower appetizer-- but I'm not sure if it's worth the $6-$7. The Sicilian thin crust pizza was packed with meat. A bit of sauce was lacking so the pizza was pretty dry. The marinara sauce is supposed to be spicy but there wasnt any heat.  Overall, food was OK and came out quickly. Service couldve been more attentive but wasnt rude either. If I wasnt at the mall already, I would never choose to eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northbrook
Tara S.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",11,60,24,4.0,8/4/2017,"Came here during lunch time with 5 other co-workers and the service was pretty good. My only problem is that our server never came back to fill up any of our waters. Mine was empty about halfway through my meal and it stayed empty throughout the rest of my meal. The restaurant was pretty empty the whole time so I'm not sure what the deal was with that. I ordered the banh mi bowl and it was good. The veggies that came with it were all pretty fresh, but it barely came with any chicken on it at all. One person got the BBQ chicken pizza and he really enjoyed it. Overall it was a good trip and I'd definitely come back again to try out more of their menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northbrook
R M.,"Chicago, IL",0,34,6,5.0,10/14/2017,"This is the first time we had returned in a couple years and I don't know why we stayed away. The service was excellent. We arrived on a busy Friday night around 7, and the nice hostess said it would probably be a 15-20 minute wait, but it turned out to be about 10 minutes. The very nice waitress came over right away to take our drink orders and offer appetizers. The service was quick. They have some great new appetizers such as the buffalo cauliflower which was amazing! The portions are large and one pizza can be shared by 2 people. Even their 'small plates' are very nicely sized such as the Wedge Salad. Prices are extremely reasonable. It seems like they are always updating their menu with limited time specials. Huge menu so if you don't like pizza they have other choices such as steak, seafood, salad and many pasta options. We plan to come back again and definitely more often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northbrook
Matthew B.,"Avon, IN",53,4,,1.0,4/6/2017,"I came here to unwind after work with some friends.  We were appalled at how many dirty tables (5)  were just sitting there throughout the ENTIRE duration of our meal.  At one point the server attempted to clean a table.  My friend thanked her and told her that it had been bothering her....and she walked away leaving the table dirty!   Not a pleasant dining experience, probably won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northbrook
Hayley S.,"Chicago, IL",449,128,64,3.0,7/8/2016,"So....if you read my previous review, you know I've had some trouble with this CPK location. Well it happened again. I came here with a friend today for lunch and it could've been great, but it was just okay.  No complaints about my food (yay!) except that the quinoa and spinach salad didn't actually come with spinach, it came with a different green. Fine, no big deal. Here's where it goes downhill: ordered the mango and strawberry cooler and never received it. When I got the check, it was on there! Obviously not going to pay for something I never received. I asked the waiter to take the charge off and explained that I never got it, and he was very understanding and apologized. He said he was having a bad day. Okay! We all have bad days, he's forgiven.

Angela S.,"Highland Park, IL",2426,776,6569,4.0,7/8/2015,"After my experience the other night, I just had to write a quick update... Being a server isn't easy, so I wanted to make sure that if CPK actually does read their reviews, they know that Jess is my favorite server at this stop...hands down. We've had her a couple of times, and each time she's been beyond super attentive and never seems bothered by any request we've made.  We stopped in the other night close to closing (sorry, we didn't realize the time), and the hostess seemed a bit annoyed by our late stop in, but not Jess! She was quick and pleasant to take our orders and didn't rush us, even though it was obvious they were closing and cleaning up all around us. The offer to refill our drinks was made, and she even waited around to make our kids the $.99 sundaes.  About the food...we pretty much always order the same thing here, two kids pizzas, the full roasted veggie salad, and sometimes a five cheese pizza. We are simple for the most part and are satisfied every time.  Two questions: 1) Why are the bread plates always smudgy? I NEVER feel like I'm eating off clean plates and always have to wipe them down, and 2) Why does CPK clearly limit bread orders, especially for those who order the salad? Note: We love the look of the new updates...clean and contemporary. And, we also love our CPK rewards card.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northbrook
Christina G.,"Lincolnshire, IL",183,200,849,3.0,3/11/2016,"This is my first time trying CPK and I wasn't extremely impressed, but I did think it was quite good for a chain. The interior is very inviting and the large booths set a very comfortable atmosphere. Although you may expect this place to only offer pizzas, they offer a variety of foods like fish, pasta,sandwiches, and salads. For my entrée, I ordered the Shaved Mushroom and Spinach flatbread. I absolutely loved it because it was not overly filling and the sprinkled parmesan made it delicious. I like to think that flatbread is another name for ""healthy pizza"". My guest actually did order healthy and settled with the Roasted Veggie salad. She said her salad was great...especially with the grilled chicken. Since I shop at Northbrook Court quite frequently, I may return here in the future. It's pretty decent food for good prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northbrook
James B.,"Kankakee, IL",2,36,,1.0,7/14/2017,"Disappointed in almost every way.  This used to be the ""go to"" place for great salads.  They still have a better recipe for salads than most, but have they ever went down hill!  This place is now more like Hotel California than anything I remember.  Prices are way, way up and portions way, way down.  I asked for a booth near the entry and was told that area is not being seated.  The internet speed here is limited by satellite pulses, so it's stop and go, stop and go.  Don't plan on enjoying any interactive content while here.  Oh yea, the food...The salad was ... very small and the ingredients other than lettuce were skimpy.  The artichokes still had the hard shell leaves on them - like chewing wood.  The flavor of the veggies was overpowered by vinegar...one of the cheapest flavors known.  Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northbrook
David W.,"Highland Park, IL",0,2,,3.0,4/1/2017,"Food is fine as always.  Portions good size.   But please explain to me why the hostess always tries to force parties of 5 to sit at a table for 4 even when the restaurant is empty.  It's obnoxious and makes for an unpleasant experience.  She wouldn't listen to my wife who asked 3 times, until I got there and said we needed a larger table.   Then watched her do it to another party of 5 shortly after us.  I get squeezing when the place is full or close to it.  But when its half empty or less, just give people the bigger table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northbrook

Corin A.,"Glencoe, IL",26,7,3,1.0,2/1/2016,"Ok, I've been here a few times and I've only had a bad experience about 3 or 4 times and every time it was with ONE server in particular! I don't know why she is THAT much different than EVERYONE else but she is the ONLY server I have EVER had problems with! The place is AMAZING and I LOVE it but every time I get seated in her section, I KNOW I'm going to have problems!  I can't think of her name right now but if I do I'll update my review. All I know is that every time I get her, the food comes slowly and usually isn't at a normal hot out of the pan temperature, and sometimes with things missing or it takes a long time for her to grab something she may have forgotten.  Tonight my boyfriend and I came in (again I'm a regular to this establishment so I'm actually on a first name basis with most of the staff) and we ordered water right away, she forgot one of the waters and had to go back. I asked her for bread, the oil, and some grated Parmesan cheese (which I was told by another server is how you ask for the Parmesan cheese on the side in a separate bowl instead of getting shredded cheese in the oil) she then told us it was going to be 10 minutes for the bread. Fine, we would wait because then it would be hot and delicious. NOPE! It was hot but it was mostly the crust and SUPER flat! I'm sorry but I didn't wait 10 minutes for flat bread.  So, after that my boyfriend and I ordered our dinner, I got the spaghetti and he got a flatbread. I just happened to look over into the kitchen as she was grabbing my boyfriend's flatbread fresh from the kitchen and then she grabbed mine FROM THE WARMER! I mean come on! It wasn't even that busy! They should've made our food together or made mine after my boyfriend's so they would both come out hot not just ""warm""  Anyways, today was a really bad experience for me but I will definitely be back ONLY because I know all the other servers are way better at actually serving people in a timely manner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northbrook

Andrea R.,"Glencoe, IL",3363,2584,1179,4.0,11/18/2014,"Chances are if you ask my 4 year old where she'd like to eat she'll mention her all time favorite restaurant, California Pizza Kitchen. While CPK wouldn't be on my top 10 list, I feel fortunate that she picks this over other kiddie restaurants like Rainforest Cafe. It turns out she's not the only little person (or big!) who likes it because they seem to be absolutely packed every weekend for both luWhile they don't take reservations you can put your name in and keep the kids entertained in the mall for a bit since the pager works all the way to the tree house (well thought out CPK!). I've had great servers here who are really good with kids, which they should be considering they serve them all day long. While I used to get my kids to eat healthy stuff like chicken and broccoli here that hasn't been the case since they discovered their pizza. My daughter is a super picky eater, but she can practically finish an entire kids pizza here.  My kids also like their buttered noodles. I typically order the hummus appetizer (also a fave of my kids) or their salad, but have to admit their pizza is pretty good. I've also recently discovered that they do pizza making bday parties, which includes a tour of the kitchen.  If it continues to be a favorite among my kids we may need to visit that as a bday party possibility once the get a little older.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northbrook

Robert D.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",4,52,,1.0,12/8/2016,"Update:  When we finished dinner, I decided to go back in order to get my credit for the missing pizza but when I looked at the credit receipt they had only credited me the $13.79 for the pizza and KEPT the tax. What a joke of management CPK has at their Northbrook location.  ----------------------------------- Don't ever consider using their curbside pick up service. I did and I'm sorry that I did.  I pulled up curbside at the appointed time, phoned the number they gave me and pressed ""2"" as directed to let them know that I was outside waiting. The phone rang 5  times then disconnected. I called again and it rang 15 times, no one answered and then it disconnected again.  Fed up, I parked in their designated parking lot pick up parking place and walked in. It was bedlam.  When I finally got noticed and gave them my name, they brought out my order and swiped my credit card (twice because it didn't take the first time).  They put two pizzas, a shrimp fettuccini and a package of arugula in a huge paper bag and two soft drinks in a holder.  I took it all home.  When I got home my wife asked me where was her pear and Gorgonzola with arugula pizza? Yep, the shorted me one pizza. We called and they claimed to have chased after me with the pizza. I think not as I was still loading the bag and soda in the car for a few minutes.  They said to come back for the pizza they forgot to give me. I said no thanks as it was 22 degrees outside and I just wanted to give me a credit card credit for the missing pizza. They said that they couldn't do that.  I again asked for a credit to my credit card but was told that they don't do that over the phone and wanted me to come in personally for them to issue a credit (WTF). I then asked to speak with a manager (Joe was his name) and he too wanted me to come in for a credit. Bad business practice.  I then asked him how much credit I would receive towards my next visit (""just mention his name next time you come in"") and, unbelievably, he DIDN'T KNOW. He no clue regarding prices on his own menu!  WTF again! He had to pass me back to the front desk to get the amount. The girl at the front desk phone told me $5.99 then changed it to $9.99. WTF another time. We looked their menu up online and it should have been $13.79 plus tax. Take my advice.  Don't forget to double and then triple check any take out order.

The 2nd time, I went there the server was extremely pushy, always trying to sell add-on to meals and additions, we never got our water refilled and when we tried to ask for bread, he was hard to find.

My friend ordered the Thai pizza of which he is a big fan (as am I) and I went with the Kung Pao Spaghetti (which I substituted penne pasta as it's much easier to eat). That was good as well.  The waiter did a fine job of taking care of us and keeping the beverages full. The only criticism I'd have of any magnitude, was compared to Deer Park, this is a ""low energy"" location. Not sure if it was the lighting, the music or something else, but if you dropped a feather in this place, you'd probably hear it hit the floor.

Valerie D.,"Deerfield, IL",447,613,101,5.0,11/13/2012,"The manager of this CPK, Randy, deserves mad props.  Last Thursday, a local animal shelter, (Orphans of the Storm) was doing a fundraising event with CPK, where, if you brought in a flyer, this CPK would donate 20% of your bill to Orphans.   My boyfriend's mom volunteers heavily with Orphans.  Last Thursday also happened to be her birthday.  So, where else would we go for dinner? CPK does not take reservations.  You can, however, call ahead to put your name in. We had a large party (15) and there was another large party (12) ahead of us on the list.  We didn't mind at all, the restaurant was jam packed, with people using their Orphans of the Storm flyers.  So, we moseyed on over to the bar to have a drink and wait.  And wait we did.  This location is one of the smaller CPK's I've seen, so waiting for a space where 15 people would comfortably fit took awhile... again, which we had NO problem with. We all ordered drinks, and a few appetizers/small plates for the group to nosh on while we waited.  Randy was very apologetic, to which we kept telling him it was no problem.  Well, Randy, is awesome, as I mentioned earlier.  He picked up our bar/appetizer tab.  That's probably 30 drinks and 6 appetizers.  Because we were waiting so patiently.  Taken care of.  On top of that, he said that he'd still give 20% to the shelter.  When we were seated, we all ordered another round of drinks and dinner.  There were a lot of tasty things on the table.  I opted for my usual, pear and gorgonzola pizza.  They changed the crust, some of the pizzas are now offered on a more Neapolitan style super thin crust.  I asked the server if she liked the new crust, and she said it was even better than the original, so I tried it, and it was really good.  I'll definitely continue to get the super thin crust.

Based on the reviews here, it seems like their take-out service is very spotty. I'm very disappointed because I used to be a big fan of this establishment. Maybe my taste has changed, but their food isn't as good as it used to be. What happened?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northbrook?start=20

Ryan R.,"Oak Park, IL",37,75,69,4.0,4/18/2015,"I probably would have given 5 stars  except for the fact I got sick after dinner. Long story short, went here before a movie and the service was fast. They changed their menu recently, and no longer serve the white pizza. Well, as I always say...anything is possible. They made it for me. Not sure if the ricotta was bad or what but I felt it later!  Otherwise, service was great and appetizers were very good. We sat up at the pizza bar area where you can see they guys toss the pizza put in the oven and right out in front of you. Excellent pizza, especially coming from a New Yorker. Try the ""jerked chicken"" pizza!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northbrook?start=20
Anne W.,"Los Angeles, CA",567,1678,622,3.0,11/29/2011,Stopped by the California Pizza Kitchen for a quick bite during our Black Friday shopping.  This is a smaller location.. we were seated near the bar. I haven't been to the CPK in a while.. so it was nice to stop by again.  We ordered the chicken lettuce wraps (since I remember them being really good at PF Chang's) and a thin crust pizza.  The chicken lettuce wraps were really overly salty... and they give you four lettuce pieces.. how can that be enough?  We had to flag people multiple times to get enough lettuce wraps to finish the dishes.  The thin crust pizza was okay... it wasn't really spicy like it was in the description... less meat than expected. The service was also meh.  The waitress didn't ever really come around except when we were almost done eating to ask us how things were.  Water wasn't filled until towards the end near the tipping.  Definitely won't be visiting anytime soon... it's just okay.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northbrook?start=20
Brandon-Dawson W.,"Forest Park, IL",33,6,,1.0,1/28/2016,"I recently had a poor customer service experience at the Northbrook, IL location. I placed an online order with a confirmed curbside pickup time of 11:54AM. I arrived on-time and parked in a curbside pickup designated parking space. I waiting approximately 5 minutes assuming someone would eventually come out and bring the order since I had to identify my vehicle when placing the order. That could very well be an erroneous assumption on my part. I noticed there was a phone number to dial on curbside parking sign so I quickly dialed it and let whoever answered the phone know that I was waiting outside. Well, 10 minutes go by without anyone bringing the order to my vehicle so I walked inside the establishment to inquire. After waiting a few minutes in the carry-out ""line"" (there was no one in line, it just took awhile for someone to help me which is understandable since it was prime lunch time), someone asked if I needed assistance. I told him I was there to pick up a curbside order and that I called about 10 minutes ago. I told him that I was scheduled to pick up my food 5 minutes before noon and it appears at the time (12:15PM) that my food wasn't ready. He said the food was ready. Clearly, the food wasn't ready at 11:54AM when it was originally scheduled or else I wouldn't be still at the location at 12:15PM. He then, in a disgruntle manner, states that the food was ready and begins to cause quite a scene. At this point, I'm rather frustrated and a few of his employees took notice of our disagreement. I asked to speak with the manager. He stated he is the manager. I asked for his name. He said his name is Mike. Then I asked for his last name for which he scoffed instead of responding. I promptly let him know that I would not be returning back to his establishment. I honestly don't expect to be treated like that by anyone in the service industry let alone a manager in the service industry. I plan to post a review on Yelp describing the poor customer service as soon as possible. On a happier note, the food was rather good. It's just too bad that it was overshadowed by the tasteless behavior of the CPK's manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northbrook?start=20

Heidi L.,"Northbrook, IL",18,71,97,4.0,1/17/2015,"What can I say, it's a chain - the pros are that it's predictable and probably open late around the holidays. We came here on New Year's Eve after circling the area looking for a place for dinner. I'm thankful that the corporate HQ made their chain open until 10 pm on a holiday night.  We haven't eaten at a CPK in years since I had this perception that their pizza toppings were too ""weird"" Thai Chicken? Avocado on pizza? Who thinks of these things? I prefer the more traditional sausage, cheese, or ""supreme"" toppings.  I didn't expect this place to have ""normal"" pizza but I was pleasantly surprised to find something called ""The Works"" with sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, green peppers (we requested no olives). Anyhoo, they did have a giant salad menu which looked very good too but quite pricey if you want to have a specialty salad ANNNND a bit of pizza. Luckily my husband and I have similar tastes... or he just eats what I let him eat, and we were able to share a salad and a pizza. Per the waitress' recommendation, we got the caramelized peach salad. It was good, although a bit on the sweet side for my salad liking. Husband ordered the blackberry fizz but it never arrived. No big deal since we weren't charged for it. Overall good meal, changed my perception of CPK a bit... we will keep this place in mind in the future...around the holidays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northbrook?start=40

Crystal Aura W.,"Deerfield, IL",24,45,8,5.0,11/4/2011,"I have been in love with California Pizza Kitchen for 15 years, I never get tired of it.  This particular location is fairly new, and it's amazing!   I have been here during slow and busy times, they always seem on the ball and the food quality is consistently delicious. There isn't a pizza I don't like, it's always so hard to decide which one I want.  I am always craving that roasted garlic chicken pizza.....I love me some roasted garlic! Recently I have been trying the salads, omg!  The small portion is actually pretty big, and they have the perfect ratio of ingredients to dressing, they are chopped up fresh.  I love the Miso Shrimp Salad and the Thai Crunch! I don't know what they do with the hummus, but it's magic!  I have had hummus from so many brands and restaurants, nobody is better than CPK!  Also the avocado club egg rolls, I'm amazed that they can fry the avocado so well in the rolls without getting too warm. Every dessert is incredible, but the must haves are the chocolate souffle cake and butter cake!  The chocolate souffle seems to have changed recipe over the years, it doesn't seem to be as dense on the cocoa as it used to, but it's still amazing.  The butter cake tastes a lot like the butter cookies you buy in a tin at Christmas time, only a thousand times better! I have gone during busy time and they are really well staffed.  I think we got the very last table on a Saturday night and we didn't wait long at all.   This location is in the Northbrook Court Mall, so it may be hard to park during peak shopping times, but not that bad.  Even when there is a wait, we have never waited long. I have heard some people complain that they don't like this location because there are too many families with lots of kids.  I've noticed that even if there are alot of kids, they seem to love their food so much they sit quietly and eat their food!  People seem happy to be here, I certainly don't mind a crowd when there is such a positive vibe!   The only downside?  This place would be terrible for anyone on a diet, lol!  One of my best friends is on Weight Watchers, she says one of the salads would be all of her points for the day.  So I HAVE to share everything with her so she doesn't eat it all.  Oh woe is me.....I have to share all that awesome food.....noooooo!!!!!

I wanted a specialty cocktail.  They didn't have the liquor I wanted, but the bartender whipped something up that was close enough and was quite good.  I had their Avocado Club Egg Rolls and Dakota Smashed Pea and Barley Soup.  (I like my pizza simple, so I order other dishes at CPK.  It's just one of my quirks.)

We had only been waiting for five minutes, and he was apologizing about how long we had been waiting and even brought us their lottery cards for ""waiting so long"".

Emily M.,"Evanston, IL",5,33,26,2.0,9/25/2010,"Two of my co-workers and I went for lunch on Friday to CPK at Northbrook Court. The place was packed, we could barely find a parking spot, though once inside CPK we didn't have to wait too long, about 10-15 minutes. There were 2 hosts and a manager at the host stand and yet none of them were jumping to bus the booth we were waiting for. Seemed a bit odd to us.  The place was crawling with kids and strollers at lunch time, not really the ideal crowd to be surrounded by but what can you do, kids and moms are everywhere in the suburbs. Especially at the mall.  Our sever was pretty lame, he didn't do anything specifically wrong but his overall service and attitude were lacking. Not that I expect 5 star service at a CPK but come on guy this is your job, I have been a server, I can empathize but try to make an effort. He didn't come by to refill water for 15 minutes and we had to ask for bread when it should have been brought upon greeting. But did I need those carbs? Not really, so maybe he knew something I didn't.... The food itself was tasty. I got the greek pizza, whole grain crust, no chicken. However when I was informed of the calorie count later (thanks a lot Christy) it definitely didn't seem worth it. I could have had McDonald's for that many calories and saved myself 10 bucks and a headache! Definitely won't be going back here.
