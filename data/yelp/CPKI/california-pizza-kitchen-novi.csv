Susan O.,"Dearborn, MI",0,41,27,5.0,7/20/2017,"Aidan's review: I ordered the Hawaiian pizza. They gave me the wrong pizza instead of my kids pizza but it all ended out well because I got to keep both pizzas! The waitress could not have been more friendly and the pizza, as always, was delicious! Mom's review: I am a big fan of CPK. They offer a tasty affordable fast casual option at several local malls which allows me to forego the crappy food courts. While they are known for their pizzas, I love their salads (especially the signature barbecue chicken salad) and tapa size appetizers (I sometimes order 2 as an alternative to ordering a meal). They have a nice selection of beer and wine, however they really shine in regard to their amazing nonalcoholic drink options. Very nice to see some creative options in this regard! I have always received stellar service from their very friendly waitstaff. And they have a great rewards program which is definitely worth checking out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi
Dan L.,"Walled Lake, MI",27,10,,3.0,11/17/2017,"Clean restaurant.  Good service.  However, our two favorite dishes Harvest Soup squash based and the Pear and Gorgazola pizza are no longer on the menu. I think they have lost their minds.  We settled for a mushroom pizza which was so so.  This was a disappointment in comparison with earlier visits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi
Karol C.,"Jackson, MS",43,82,18,4.0,6/11/2016,"I have eaten a few varieties of CPK frozen pizzas from the market and have thought that they were decent. As I walked by the restaurant at the mall, I thought I might give the restaurant a try. The signage advertising the Sangria Flight sealed the deal. I explained to the lovely waitress, Hershey Kisses, that it was my first time at the restaurant. She ordered me a complimentary small plate of white corn guac to celebrate my visit. It was very tasty and fresh, but a bit too spicy for my comfort though. The trio of sangria's were wonderful, fruity and refreshing on this 90 degree day. I also had the mushroom sausage and pepperoni pizza. Everything was good. I'll certainly visit again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi
Cindy S.,"Novi, MI",0,7,,4.0,5/12/2017,"This was, by far, the best gf pizza crust I've had since going gluten-free in 2008. Very tasty! I ordered the pepperoni gluten free pizza to get the traditional pizza experience I've been missing and I was not disappointed. Great flavor in the crust, sauce and pepperoni. (Edge of crust was burnt so I had to cut all that off.)   Our server, Chloe, was great. Made sure to mark my allergy on the ticket for the kitchen staff. Was pleasant and helpful to everyone (6) at our table. The only drawback is the price...one personal size pizza with tip is $20. So I can't do it often but will reserve for a special lunch treat!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi
Terri H.,"Waterford, MI",1,10,8,4.0,1/16/2017,"I had a terrific time, Chloe was our server and likely the best service I have had in a while.  We were greeted at the door by our server that continued the fun and happiness at the table.  Suggested some meal ideas, drinks, and of course desserts.   We even ordered our lunch for tomorrow and along with the appetizers we might even have dinner.  Great portions with a very fair price.  Chloe explained how everything is fresh and showed us a few things. Why is it 4 stars and not 5..... I'm in the business and you cannot run out of the basics and/or the drinks that are on the menu, no bueno.  I also ordered a drink off the menu that was not great, the citrus crush (less absolute Citron) was not good....I would not recommend it. Ordered the ever famous avacado/chicken egg rolls that bring me here all the time.  The pesto pasta with chicken was Uber fabulous, the pizza was great.   So with all that said, my girls and I don't get time together so Chloe, I thank you for making a dinner tonight with Elle, Christy and I an experience instead of just a meal.   See you soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi
Amy L.,"East Lansing, MI",0,12,3,1.0,12/6/2017,"We arrived on a Tuesday afternoon, and the restaurant was not at all busy. We were seated immediately, but waited quite a while for our server to show up. Finally ""Taylor"" showed up and brought us water. We didn't see her again for almost 20 minutes even though we made our decisions quickly and set the menus on the edge of the table so that she could see we were ready. She was up at the bar area chatting and was not watching her tables. She seemed preoccupied, never smiled and was not at all pleasant. After she finally took our order, things continued to go downhill. We ordered a Caesar salad to split, which was bought in a large bowl and a Margherita  pizza. There were two small plates already at the table that we used for the salad. The pizza came from another server and had two HUGE air bubbles that were very noticeable. I wish I had taken a picture to attach to the review. Our salad plates were never removed and we had only those dirty plates to use for our pizza. The salad bowl sat teetering on the edge of the table as we tried to make room for everything. Taylor never removed the dirty dishes, never checked back and we didn't see her again until she brought our bill. The Margherita pizza tasted more like thin cheese bread. Toppings were skimpy and most pieces had very little cheese and no tomatoes on them. Taylor definitely needs more training and the cooks need to make sure the food is presentable before it comes out. We won't ever come back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi
Lynn H.,"Northville, MI",312,514,291,3.0,1/29/2016,"So... 1 star for service and 5 stars for food yields a 3 star experience.  The only time I go to this CPK is if I'm already in the mall shopping. All other times, I prefer the Laurel Park location. Everything on the menu at CPK is yummy.  My favorites are the Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings or Avocado Spring Rolls apps, Dakota Smashed Pea and Barley soup, Moroccan Spiced Chicken or Thai Crunch salads, BBQ Chicken pizza, and Salted Caramel pudding. Unfortunately, the service here sucks.  Every wait person I've encountered over many visits has been bordering on, or downright rude.  I shouldn't feel like I'm interrupting their other important business, but that's how they always act.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi
Karen D.,"Waterford Township, MI",5,31,2,3.0,5/14/2017,"Food was decent. When a chain has the name of a food in the title, then they just need to do that one thing right.

Calvin K.,"Ferndale, MI",2,62,24,1.0,4/23/2017,1 hour for 2 thin sliced pizza and we got them they were burnt like a chip. 15 people sitting in the restaurant not busy at all.

Cassandra Y.,"Burbank, CA",5000,1339,8961,1.0,10/3/2014,"The Service: SLOW!! INATTENTIVE!! Not a lot of customers in the restaurant at that day but the staffs were standing there chatting with each other. We tried very hard to get their attention to get some service? Our server was constantly staying inside the kitchen, no where to be found? We ordered more beer but our server forgot about it. He never refilled our water either. Really bad service.... The Food: Spinach Artichoke Dip - the dip is just a little bit warm, taste like pre-made.  Waldorf Chicken Salad - OVER DRESSING! None of the vege are crisp. Too much dressing, too sour. Very disappointed.  Jambalaya Fettuccine - Flavor is okay.  Kids meal - one beverage & one entree. Large portion for pizza and mac & cheese, more than enough for kids.  The Parking: mall parking lot.

Sarah L.,"Canton, MI",52,65,70,2.0,11/15/2015,"Nice wait staff; nice environment but the food is no where near worth what you pay for it! It is mediocre pizza with whatever toppings they want to put on. You can change their pizzas by removing items but for some reason you can not start from scratch to make whatever kind of pizza you would like. The crust is beyond plain and has no flavor or seasoning on it at all. I will be going to anywhere other than here for pizza.

Christina S.,"Royal Oak, MI",21,179,141,3.0,7/18/2016,"We ordered take out, curbside yesterday. I have to say the customer service was wonderful. Efficient, smooth and extremely nice. We ordered lettuce wraps which were packaged individually and easy to take home. Also, a pizza. Everything was absolutely delicious, until 5 hours after we ate. I'm not sure if there was MSG or if the meat was just too fatty or what the deal was but I had extreme stomach cramping for about 3 hours. We ate around 5pm, my stomach started bubbling and gurgling from 9-10pm and then the extreme cramping. I feel fine this morning but whatever the reason for the pain, it's safe to say I will not be ordering that dish again. My husband loved the pizza so we will just stick to that!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi
Ernie M.,"Northville, MI",42,396,58,3.0,10/5/2015,We have been to other CPK's but the first time here. As usual the food was very good. I had the meat cravers thin crust pizza and it was full of meat. The lower crust could have been a little crispier though--maybe a little more time in the oven. My wife had the Dakota Pea soup and loved it. She finished with half of Roasted Veggie salad and loved it. The Nobilo Sauv Blanc was good. Stacey did a great job serving us.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi
Some N.,"Wixom, MI",0,17,,4.0,6/4/2016,"I seem to have had a better go of the service than other reviewers. I've gone here a lot over the years and there's been some rough services but usually, I haven't had much of a problem. The food here is great. Their chicken tortilla soup is to die for, although they've cut back the portion and it's more pricey than I'd care for. They do excellent pizzas, as one would hope. Good sandwiches, good salad, the pasta was good too. I think for your money, the sandwich is your best deal here. The pizza/salad/soup/entrees are a bit overpriced, but at least don't disappoint. Their ""butter cake"" dessert option is stupidly good, just unreal. Try to go here when they give out the mystery coupon thing with your bill. You basically go through a meal like normal and then they give you this coupon at the end that'll be good for an unknown discount on your next meal, assuming you go back in like a month's time. It'll be something like 10-20% as I recall, unless you get lucky and get the mad coupon deals. Something to watch out for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi

I have NEVER been charged anywhere for half and half pizza, that is ridiculous. I tried the Five Cheese and Tomato pizza and it was really bland. The only thing that tasted decent was the crust.

Ashley J.,"Ypsilanti, MI",0,2,,1.0,12/29/2014,"A group of us (6 and a baby) came to eat here. I must say it was by far the worst customer service I've experienced. The lady was very rude. She started with our drinks and was very dry. When it cam to ordering and my husband glanced at the menu before ordering, she says ""I have 4 other tables"" pretty much rushing us. Then when my brother inlay asked for a plastic fork, she gave him a rude look and questioned him with an attitude. She did not bring out bread for us but other tables she did until i had to ask for it. She was not good at giving us refills. When she walked by us, she would not make eye contact so it was hard to get her attention of anything. I left her a note with my payment. As we were standing outside, you see her get very angry. I'm sorry, if you don't have good customer service skills, then don't work in this field. Never returning again. Also the pasta was dry and had no taste, the pulled bbq chicken had little chicken and more slaw in it making it very dry. pizza was a little burned...once again won't return again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi?start=40

I agree with pretty much everything said in the other review about this place...the servers tell you here that the pizzas are meant for ONE person... ridiculous....ok I will admit I have eaten a whole one alone when I have had a massive munchie hangover...but one person for a 13.99 pizza? wtf? No one should be eating a whole one of these in a sitting. Fav pizzas are the chicken BBQ and California club...the food is good quality BUT it's pizza, which leads me to saying.... Everything here is ridiculously over priced as well...my friend always wants to go here, and being an easy going gal I am ok with it. It does amaze me how they have the balls for charge over 4 bucks for a cup of crushed pea and barley soup(and come on, people, we all know they have to use the dried peas you can get at kroger out of a box, for under a dollar).  A half sized salad should not be over 8 bucks....you can't even get a small size salad here to start off your meal and that pisses me off too. Plus you have all ready about places that have 1000 calorie salads ?? I promise you CPK is one of those offenders. With my friends 5 dollar off coupon it was actually the cheapest I ever got out of there for a cup of soup and splitting a pizza...first time I have ever gotten out for under 10 bucks with tip...amazing.  it's not worth a special trip by any means, but the food is ok and the service is good....I will be back because I am desperate for company at lunch....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi?start=40

I am a big fan of CPK, if you would like to eat there choose their Laurel Park Livonia or Somerset Mall Troy locations. At this location the restaurant is a mess. I sat at the bar, the bartender/server did not wipe the counter down. Also, it took 3 times of asking for a water to receive one. The bartenders left all there personal belongs like keys, phones, purses all over the bar. The bartenders threw straws over the ground, spilled drinks all over, left straw wrappers all over. Also we could see the back area where all the servers type in their tables orders and it was a pig stye.

Sure they still do the pizzas, pastas, salads, but I noticed a change in their ingredients....for the better. Bacon is supplied by Nueske, a nice looking wine and beer list, and a lovely thin crust pizza that I got topped with gorgonzola, pear, and hazelnuts. It also came with some greens tossed with a gorgonzola dressing and I quite liked it. It's not fine dining but for mall food it's juuuust fine.

The hostess seated us promptly.  The service we received while seated was less than desirable.  One waitress began waiting on us and then another brought our food out.  No issues with that but after that we did not have someone waiting on us for the rest of the evening.  Had to specifically call out waiters walking by to let them know we wanted dessert.  Then, the dessert took about 15-20 minutes to come out and by that point we just wanted to leave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi?start=20
Lilyan T.,"Novi, MI",0,72,2,2.0,4/10/2016,"Placed a carry out order yesterday for a California club pizza and full-size roasted veggie salad. The total was $31, which for the portions, and what we received, was embarrassingly over priced. The cherry on the cake, however, was the painful and explosive diarrhea I got about an hour after I ate the salad. Won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi?start=20
Scott G.,"MILFORD, MI",0,28,4,3.0,6/11/2013,"Love the atmosphere and the décor. Clean, friendly and inviting.  Have eaten here several times already having the spinach artichoke dip; four cheese ravioli; spaghetti Bolognese and the margherita pizza.  I really can't complain about the food. It's tasty, good and the presentation is spot on as well. But, I do have a couple observations.  First, my four cheese ravioli was good. Only problem, there wasn't enough of it. My portion would have been great for a lunch service but when I pay $12.50 for ravioli I expect just a few more in the bowl, which was more like a soup bowl you'd serve at lunch.  I was still hungry when I left after a recent outing. I have to quip that in that respect this really does remind me of California - it's not cheap and the portions are small. Number two; I love good service, but sometimes the service can be too good. An example was last night. The waitress was asking us about dessert before we were halfway done with our meal.  Then, a few moments later (my buddy still was in the midst of eating his third piece of pizza and I my ravioli) she brought the bill. She said there was no rush but asking about dessert halfway through the meal and bringing the bill certainly suggests a ""get outta here soon"" mentality and no, it wasn't past closing time and we weren't exactly lingering over drinks.  I know our waitress was just trying to provide good service but it was a bit overly ambitious. All in all, not a bad place to eat and certainly a cut above the rest of the similar fare in 12 Oaks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi?start=20
Scott F.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",113,20,1,2.0,4/6/2013,"Popped in to meet a friend for a quick salad lunch.  Place was not very busy, yet it took more than 10 minutes to have a server approach us.  I ordered the Caramelized Peach Salad, asked to add salmon and have it cooked medium rare (how I like it), the server snapped back extremely snarky 'IT'S COOKED TO ORDER'  When the salad came out was soggy and salmon was overcooked, not just to 'order' but very dry. Out of the few times visiting a CPK, I've had 1 good experience.  Need to step up their game, especially with the customer service. Think I will take my quick business lunches elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi?start=20
Anna N.,"Wixom, MI",1,27,,4.0,10/3/2013,"Love this place. Been here twice and both times had a great experience.  Got pizza both times so only commenting and rating on that and overall service/experience. Got the works on whole grain and it was delicious. I like to people watch at restaurants...I know it's annoying to catch someone staring in your direction but I mostly do it just to check out and guess what the dish someone else is eating/portion size etc.  I would like to try the pasta's here but I honestly hate to say that paying over $10 for a pasta dish anywhere other than some michelin star restaurant just doesn't bode well with me. Also some creamy pasta dishes I can never finish fully either so I hate to waste my money on thick overly filling dishes and thats why I mostly stick to pizza's at italian style joints. I mean come on you can handmake your own alfredo sauce with ingredients most already have in their kitchen...then you can buy pasta and some garlic bread at the supermarket for under $10 and feed a group of people. Just my opinion though. I have the same view on salads also for the most part. I had to give one whole star to CPK for introducing me to Beringer's Zinfandel wine...omg...it's the nicest wine I have ever had, no joke! I better be able to find it in Ireland when I return home this month. Also the desserts are above par. I've only tried the red velvet cheesecake and it was amazing. I am a sucker for red velvet anything though but this was gorgeous. The portion size was huge and definitely something to share after a huge pizza main.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi?start=20

Gretchen H.,"Brighton, MI",0,5,,1.0,1/4/2016,"Only went because there was a 1.5 hour wait at the Cheesecake Factory across the hall.  Service was slow and had to ask repeated times for things (drinks, dressing).  Food didn't taste great, especially for the price.  Would not go again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi?start=20
RH F.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",0,13,,1.0,9/2/2015,"After viewing the menu online, I called to order takeout for my family.  We had decided on dinner salads for everyone, and each salad had avocado pictured abundantly on the website menu.  When placing my order, I was informed that there would be a $2.75 up charge for the avocado on EACH salad. What the what!?! Since when are avocados so precious, and why do you feature something in your menu pictures if its not even included?  Btw, without the avocado, the bbq chicken salad is just iceberg lettuce, chicken, onion, tomato, and cheese. Nice try, CPK, but I'll go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi?start=20

Ashley N.,"Kansas City, MO",22,34,1,5.0,11/14/2012,Well...I'm shocked by how many people dislike this place and I am a restaurant SNOB! I am never disappointed when I go to ANY CPK location. Now I will say that I have never ordered their pizza...please don't judge...but I only order the pasta and salads. Their pasta is absolutely excellent every single time!! The ingredients are always fresh the food is not microwaved or taste as if it were frozen at one time.  When I want great pasta dishes with no worries of if it will be a hit or miss I always turn to CPK...It's my #1!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi?start=20
