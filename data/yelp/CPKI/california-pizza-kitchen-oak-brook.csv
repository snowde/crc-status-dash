Leslie S.,"Chicago, IL",38,43,12,3.0,1/30/2017,"They seated us pretty quickly but then didn't give us table wear including napkins until we were well into our greasy avocado egg rolls. And even then we had to flag a busboy down cause no server was to be found. And STILL it took a bit to get them. We ordered our main meals with the appetizer. Again though, it took FOREVER for them to come out. Just as we were going to hunt someone down to see what was going on cause our movie was going to start in less than a half hour, they came. All the food was delicious but the slow service was a definite detractor. As soon as the server came to ask how it was, we instantly asked for the check. Not going to take any chances on ghosting some more or taking forever to bring it back. She also offered refills at last for my friends but did not bring a refill of my empty plain old water for me. And I had a spicy jambalaya pasta. (She did later bring one for me as we were almost ready to go). We went here with well over an hour leeway, close to an hour and a half, thinking this would be faster than a steakhouse. We didn't even get pizzas which might take longer. Fail. Next time we'll know. Also, jokingly when my friend was pretend pouting over not being special enough to get a coaster with her drink, I mockingly joked that they were racist. With the delays and inattentiveness, now I'm not so sure I should have been joking. She's African American. Her hubby and I aren't yet got coasters. Silly, I know. And I was being silly saying that at the beginning of the meal. But all the other items kinda make you wonder. I know we didn't announce that we have a movie to catch at the start like I usually do. But with how much time we had, I didn't think it necessary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook?start=40
Robert G.,"Carol Stream, IL",174,503,173,3.0,10/31/2014,"The pizza at CPK is as good as I remember. Almost everything else, not so much.  For starters they asked if they could bring out some oil and bread. And I said sure, because for heaven's sake, who doesn't get the free oil and bread? While technically free, it was quite hard. Also there were four relatively small chunks. I was a bit disappointed.  In addition we got strawberry and raspberry lemonade. Both could have come from mixes. At least consider the thought of blending in real berries, guys.  I ordered mac n' cheese bites for an appetizer, which were small but fried up nice and crispy. I'm uncertain as to the origins of the cheese, but I would get it again.  Their namesake pizzas are still quite good. I had a peanut Thai pizza that had fresh, crunchy vegetables, while my wife had her usual barbecue chicken. The honey wheat crust has been refined since the last time I've gone, and is better now.  The service was OK. We went a long time without being checked up on, but it wasn't terrible.  Overall, stick to the pizzas, and I think you'll come away with a positive experience here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook?start=40
Martin K.,"Downers Grove, IL",10,2,1,1.0,5/7/2015,"Thank you California Pizza Kitchen at Oak Brook for the dead fly in my wife's pasta.  That was a real treat, especially this far out of season.  The manager should have offered to comp the entire meal, not just a portion of it.  I didn't argue or even ask them to do otherwise.  I was more concerned that I had eaten some of the pasta and so had my three year old.  I wasn't about to haggle over 20 bucks, but in retrospect it was not a very classy move on their part.  I won't be coming back.  The waitress was very nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook?start=40

Angelica F.,"Champaign, IL",516,20,509,4.0,9/23/2015,I am extremely satisfied every time I eat at California Pizza Kitchen. They do an amazing job with their pizzas and their salads delicious as well. I always end up ordering the kids sized pizza because I feel that they cook it in the oven for longer and the crust comes out crunchier.  I have had numerous birthday celebrations at this restaurant and I have yet to try something on the menu that I do not like. I highly recommend going if you are in the area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook?start=40
Sung Y.,"Bloomingdale, IL",15,107,174,4.0,3/19/2016,It's been years since we dined at CPK. This Oakbrook location has a nice interior. Placed seemed pretty busy on Saturday evening. We were seated immediately and service was prompt and efficient. We ordered kale salad and Thai chicken pizza. Both were very tasty.

Kavita B.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",17,88,816,3.0,10/10/2015,"Very nice interior,decor,spacious seating with full bar.  As soon as i got seated,the server came and got surprised by the fact that this was my first visit to California pizza kitchen..Well me and my friends ordered hand tossed(specialty of California pizza kitchen) California veggie and five cheese pizza. In starters we opted for Spinach Artichoke Dip and Tortilla spring rolls .  I have also ordered Caribbean Sunset Sangria which was very smooth and delightful,starters were up-to the mark. I just loved spinach artichoke dip,it was very creamy and crunchy at the same time.  Moving on to pizza,personally i liked five cheese pizza over the veggie one. It was cheesy,with fresh tomatoes,and soft corners...not heavy at all...  Overall food and service were good,I would like to try some more pizza(with meat) on my next visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook?start=40

The guac was awesome  with  beans and corn mixed in. We had a lettuce wrap and a sicilian pizza.

Annie D.,"Lombard, IL",0,30,,3.0,7/12/2017,"My family and I love CPK for the amazing food. From the pizza to the salad we're always leaving full and satisfied. It's a shame that I'm leaving a 3 star review for a place that we love so much. The big problem is with the staff, the last 3 times I went in the hostess were so rude and short with us. A few weeks ago when we came (we come often) we witnessed one hostess being rude to the other hostess and it made us feel so uncomfortable right when we walked in! As someone who works in the customer service industry I know it's rule number one to smile and greet people when they walk in. If this was a one time thing I wouldn't have a problem but it seems to have become a constant as the hostess was not so friendly with my sister and I when we came in today. Also, our waitress hardly came to check on us and we were sitting with empty plates for a while before she came to give us the check and she never told us her name so when someone came by to get other empty plates I didn't know who to ask for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook?start=40
S R.,"Elgin, IL",11,58,198,5.0,4/5/2014,This place is not what it was even a year ago... It's better. Way better. Bester.. If that can be a word. Their super thin crusts are the thinnest on the planet. Any thinner and you'll have a plate of just the toppings in from of you!  Take a seat by the bar... It's free entertainment...pizza tossing perfection!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook?start=40
Anasteisha L.,"Lisle, IL",10,13,5,4.0,11/9/2015,It was nice experience. Good design inside and pretty big space which I really like. We tried couple different pizzas and all of them tastes delicious.

Natalie D.,"Chicago, IL",290,313,269,3.0,7/7/2014,I used to eat here all the time but in resent years the quality seems to have diminished. The items on the menu that I used to love are no longer available. The service is always spotty and slow. The drinks are missable. The price is a bit high for the quality.  It's probably time for this franchise to either go through an overhaul or to close it's doors. It's mall food now and the gimmick is old news.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook?start=40
Shin M.,"Denver, CO",50,707,21,2.0,2/27/2015,"I got a garlic cream fettuccine. It was basically an alfredo pasta but it was very powdery and not as creamy as it should have been. I did like the texture of the fettuccine. It was a pretty big portion. Overall, it was just ok.

Maria C.,"Springfield, IL",0,2,,1.0,5/15/2016,"Very bad customer service! Will never go back!  I called in my party at around 7:10 for Maria for 10 ppl.. Of course I know that didn't mean I was gonna b seated right away when arrived, but when I got there I saw another party walk in of Indian people and got sat before us.. My friend asked the hostess why if we were there first and she responded that they were seating in the high top chairs which if she would've asked us we would've had no problem taking that seating... She was very rude, both of the girls that were there.. As soon as we seat the server comes to us without greeting us or anything. Probably because they had already told her we were pissed. ( I'm a server and I know how things goes and also know how customer service should be.) I also took the alcohol serve safe test and it never said to check the identification from both sides and the server Maria told one of my guests to do so, but never noticed my tier guests identification was expired which is ridiculous... If we didn't call a manager over was because it was surely known we would get the same reaction as all of the employees there.. Very poor service at this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook?start=40
Aimee M.,"Chicago, IL",425,1212,160,4.0,9/24/2013,"I love this location. It's in Oakbrook Center's ""Kids Wing""--as I like to call it. I can plan a shopping excursion for my son at Stride Rite and the Children's Place and even get him a hair cut at Kid Snips in this area.  Then once the lunch crowd has died down, stroll(er) on in to CPK for lunch.  They definitely know they are in the Kid's Wing because they really anticipated our needs. Highchair, crayons, kids menu immediately get offered.  And after we ordered, my son's pizza came out first--which really helps when you're trying to keep a toddler occupied in a restaurant. The food is good. I'd give it 3 solid stars. My go-to is always the Thai Chicken salad and the Avocado Club Egg Rolls. The salad is always fresh and not overly dressed. Great flavors. The Egg Rolls are good too. Most of the time the avo is good; once in a while it's kind of mushy, but for the most part I'm happy with them.  I love the spicy dipping sauce that comes with the egg rolls and they even gave me some to take home with my left over egg rolls.  Friendly service bumps it up to 4 stars. Checking on us often, refilling drinks, picking up crayons he dropped so I don't have to get up, holding the door open for me and my stroller son? Always always appreciated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook?start=40
Katie C.,"Bloomington, IL",4,200,11,1.0,4/14/2016,"I don't care if the food is decent- for THIS particular location it only gets one star. Why? Because my family was treated extremely rudely by the hostess. She was unfriendly from the beginning, my husband and I gave each other ""the look"" after she ""greeted"" us because her attitude was so bad. We had a simple request about having a table where we could bring the stroller with us and she responded ""you can either leave the stroller up here, or you can find another restaurant to eat at"". Our baby was a fussy newborn who was sleeping at that time, so no we were not going to move her. I've never ever had an issue in any other restaurant saying I can't bring the stroller to sit next to the table, on the inside so it doesn't block the walkway for waiters and other customers. Her behavior was disgusting and rude, we left immediately and I will warn everyone I know about this particular location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook?start=40

Catherine P.,"Merrillville, IN",437,492,2281,4.0,7/6/2011,"Never been before, and will be back! Went in with a group of 7 on a Friday night. (yes, we braved a Friday night dinner without reservations in Oak Brook for seven people) We only had to wait about 20-25 minutes or so. Good company will always help the time pass by quickly. :) We were seated near the back of the restaurant in pretty much in the middle of the restaurant. Round table, near the kitchen. Heavy service foot traffic . Total family place. Loud and busy. Service could have been better, but the whole experience was just fun. Hence, the 4 stars. I typically am not a fan of loud places but when you are with a larger group and there are two teen girls in your party, a loud place ain't a half bad idea. I should bring my loud-ass family back with me! I have been wanting to go here for years and because my gal pal had a 50% off coupon for a party up to 10 people, we gave it a shot. How bad can half price food be anyways??? We ordered three apps. Chicken potsticker/dumpling thingys, a variety of spring rolls and their version of a hummus app. I'll be honest, the food was not served hot, it was lukewarm. The sauce served with the dumplings was very yummy. The spring rolls were something different and fun to try and the hummus was NOT hummus (at least by the traditional standards). It was loose, liquid-y and very little texture at all and probably why they add tomatoes to it. Served with, what I think, was suppose to be warm pita bread, it was okay. We each got our own pizza. Now, I gotta say, the obvious-hand-tossed thin crust was very desirable. Crispy and fresh. Loved it!! Made the apps look like over priced bar food. I guess these pizzas are the reason this place is popular. The pizzas range from about $10 up to $16 or so. I'm estimating, here, kids. I enjoyed the Chicken Pesto Pizza. It was light and the ingredients were fresh! Not a ton of meat, but it was good. I would order it again, for sure. Other pizzas ordered at our table: Thai Chicken, Tostada, Plain cheese, and Wild Mushroom. We all traded each other for a piece here and there and were able to sample pizzas that we weren't definitely interested enough in to order a whole one for ourselves.  We all had leftovers (probably would have had as many if we had skipped the apps), and it reheated nicely in the toaster oven.  We'll be back, but a coupon would probably be the best way to get me in again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook?start=40
Barbette A.,"Chicago, IL",8,98,148,1.0,8/30/2015,I would pass this place up. The women's bathroom smelled like the gorilla cage @ Brookfield.  Our table wasn't even.

Carissa L.,"Lisle, IL",400,13,3,2.0,8/8/2017,"Alright. We went here in July and it was... not a good experience. Overall, understaffed, undertrained, and overpriced was our impression. For what you're paying, go somewhere else.  First impression, unfriendly host and hostess who never smiled once the 15 minutes we waited. We asked for menus while we waited (even though there were many empty tables), and mine was missing a center card and had a large drip of oil inside. Our hostess didn't seem like she knew what she was doing as she led us to a table, which didn't have enough bread plates for our party. When our waitress brought out water, my thirsty self immediately took a sip and she warned us that the cups were only rinsed, not washed, and gave us straws. While I'm thankful she warned us, CPK... yall, what the hell??  When our food finally came out, we received no forks and, after asking, learned they were out of them... which was a problem considering we ordered three pasta plates. My California club pizza sounded great on paper and looked pretty in pictures, but basically, it was a bunch of avocado and lettuce with some bacon/chicken on a pizza crust. No sauce, not much cheese. I got a lot of jokes about my ""salad"". The positives, our waitress was super nice in spite of the clusterfuck that seemed to be going on! I appreciated her honesty and friendly service. A lot of the staff seemed very pressed but very nice, it seems like most of the problems are logistical. Ironically, where the pizzas were mediocre, the pasta dishes and bread/oil were excellent. Like, seriously good pasta. These are the only two reasons I'm giving two stars instead of one - kitchen/waitstaff and pasta.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook
Marggie S.,"Darien, IL",0,10,,1.0,8/2/2017,"Very disappointed!!!   Ordered a margarita pizza, menu was deceiving, a medium pizza from Pizza Hut would have tasted better for 1/2 the price.   Pizza arrived with tomatoes around the edge of the pie, shavings (very-very little) of Mozzarella cheese, not worth the $15.00.   AND they charge $3.29 for a glass of soda.  Might have been worth it if the waiter stopped by to ask if everything was ok or if we wanted a refill.    Paid bill and asked for manager to complain.  She said we should have said something sooner and she would 'take care of it'.  What a lousy gift certificate to a place I'd never return?    Don't eat here, don't waste your money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook
Michelle C.,"Melrose Park, IL",235,147,467,5.0,4/4/2017,"My aunt and I visited at lunch time on a Saturday and we were quickly seated. We did not have to wait for a table at all.

We also ordered the chocolate cake and ice cream.. YUM. Although I definitely didn't need it! California Pizza Kitchen is always a solid choice for food. You can't go wrong with their food.

Liz K.,"Winfield, IL",171,45,31,1.0,8/23/2017,"I got takeout and ordered the Buffalo cauliflower appetizer. The pictures of them I saw on here looked good, crumbled bleu cheese and laying in a big bed of dressing. But when I received mine there was probably 2 chunks of bleu cheese and no dressing. Just the wilted cauliflower. It was spicy. That's about it.  I also ordered the new mushroom gemelli. It wasn't anything special. The mushrooms were flavorful but the sauce is just an oily sauce. I was hoping for a thicker sauce and for $15 it was not that big. Especially considering there were a few of (what I think- but not sure) giant mushroom stems mixed in. They were too hard and chewy for me to even stick my fork into. It grossed me out and I didn't finish my meal. If they are thrown in there for flavor they shouldn't serve it in the pasta because it makes it seem like there is more food but there isn't because these are inedible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook

It's generally pretty busy (and noisy) so sometimes the wait is a bit lengthy. Service is about average, I wouldn't say it's anything bad, nor is it where they went out of their way to provide above-par service either. Food is okay, not bland in flavor but it isn't any different to me than let's say a Pizza Hut or a TGI Fridays, so take that with a grain of salt.

Drive home (6 minute drive), open the box, and my pizza was ICE COLD!! The cheese was hardened, like it had clearly been sitting out for quite some time and the pizza was all disheveled, barely any toppings, barely any cheese.

Thank God I didn't, though. The service at the table made up for the off-putting young lady at the front. Our waitress was very informational and reminded me to use my rewards card!

The hostess led us in a circle before finding seats which I thought would be finalized after our wait. When we arrived to our seats the first thing brought out was the bread but not enough plates for our 5 person party. When our drinks came there were no straws and this was important because our waitress told us that the cups were only rinsed not washed so we shouldn't put our lips to the glass.

Well the next morning bruised and sore I went to Dr. nothing sprained or broke(thank goodness) but I was sore for about 3 days. I went in and talked to manager about paying the 90.00 for the DR. bill for a gesture of good will and my embarrassment. He said there company should get in touch with me.

Rachel H.,"Chicago, IL",23,126,235,4.0,1/7/2017,"My go to spot when I am in Oakbrook doing a little shopping with my daughter. Great place for families and if you have little ones. The wait time is minimum. They have their own menu with an activity and page to color and they give the little ones crayons, which is nice and cute. My daughter loves the chicken nuggets and the cheese pizza. Their entrees come with a drink with free re-fills and you can add dessert, like ice-cream for a buck $1, so like I said great place to eat with kiddes. They have a nice menu for adults as well. I love their lettuce wraps. Tasty, fully of flavor and plentiful. It comes as an appetizer, but its so filling it can be your entree. Their salads and pizzas are good too. The BBQ chicken pizza is my favorite. Drinks are good and tasty, but not as potent as they can be. If I spend $10 on an alcoholic beverage I expect a little kick. I typically prefer their flavored lemonades that come in a variety of flavors, like strawberry, raspberry and mango. Overall, a good solid place to eat in Oakbrook and especially if you're looking for a laid back family friendly place where if kids cry and act out no one is looking at you with funny looks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook

My brother and I started off with the avocado club rolls and they were extremely oily and over fried (how can something be over fried you ask? when the dough because extremely bland and cracks easily, at least to me).  We then shared the chipotle pizza and the three cheese ravioli. Like I said the food is a hit or miss and it was a miss on the pizza this time, maybe my taste buds are off, but chipotle pizza is one of my favorite dishes at CPK and it didn't satisfy me. However, the three cheese ravioli was yummy with the cream/tomato sauce.

I was waiting for my mom and brother, so the waitress brought bread, oil and drinks, which I appreciated. CPK has been trying to upgrade and seem a bit ""fancier"" lately, and I have mixed feelings about it. Some of my usual favorites have been ""upgraded"" and I do not like them anymore.  We started with the Cesar salad, which was good as usual. I ordered the Pepperoni pizza light sauce and it was delicious. I usually get the traditional cheese, but it's no longer on the menu. My brother also ordered a pizza and my mom had a pasta, which she enjoyed.  My main problem was the service. Our waitress was pregnant, so I'm not sure if it had to do with that but she only came back maybe 2 times and we often had to ask other servers or the bus boy for more drinks, the check, etc. It was irritating enough to cause me to write this review.

I ordered a very basic grilled chicken sandwich and what I got was a cold, disgusting, stale, and sad excuse for a sandwich. Not only was the sandwich barely edible and tasteless, but also the food here almost immediately gave me a sore throat that lasted the rest of the week. My pet birds could have made a better sandwich than this place. On top of that, the waiter seemed to not know how to properly serve. Furthermore, one simple sandwich (that is usually impossible to screw up) was screwed up and cost about $14. Yes 14 dollars for a sandwich. you mine as well just go to a gourmet restaurant and get something actually edible. This place is overpriced for its lower than low quality and lack of service.

Courtney C.,"Chicagoland, IL",198,839,1924,4.0,12/17/2012,"Where I grew up, there were no CPK locations. CPK to us was just frozen pizzas at the grocery store. I'm glad that I work close to this CPK location and have been able to experience it because I'm a pretty big fan now! I've had pasta and thin crust pizza in the past and liked them. The pizzas are a little different from most pizza joints and most are thin crust and not flavors you'd find at traditional pizza locations. Last week our work catered a lunch for us from CPK. I had the chicken tortilla soup, the carnitas tacos, chips & salsa, and a piece of red velvet cake. Way too much food for one person, but I saved half of it for dinner. The chicken tortilla soup, I ordered based on Yelp recco's, so thanks guys! It was fantastic and some of the greatest soup I've had in awhile. I would have traded the rest of my meal in for 3 more cups of that soup. The carnitas tacos were really good, but by the time I got to them, the avocado had made them a bit soggy. Still tasted good though, so I can't complain. I thought that it was cool that the restaurant also threw in a nice plate of cookies and brownies which included Snickerdoodles--my favorite cookie from my childhood. One of the girls I worked with ordered the BBQ chicken pizza which has great reviews on Yelp and she said it was awesome. That's next on my ""To try' list. I did the curbside pickup and it took about 15-20 minutes from when I called and said I was there until I actually got the food, which is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook?start=60

My companion had a lunch salad and said it was very good.

Rachel L.,"Lombard, IL",0,12,,1.0,1/31/2016,"So it's taken me about a week to cool off from the horrible service my family received last Friday evening. My family and I were shopping and decided to go to CPK for our dinner as this is one of our favorite pizza places.  had we known what we were in for we would have turned around and went elsewhere! The hosted was very sweet and she was not the issue, it was the servers. We got sat in a both that was dirty so we asked to have it cleaned so they decided to move us to the back section, which was already closed off, but they still sat us there. In the process of us moving to the new table a server came up behind me and said move I'm right behind you. Last time I check 1. I don't have eyes in the back of my head and 2. You never talk to someone that way period! I moved out of his way but apparently he was already aggravated with me and decided to again tell me to move myself out of his way. Okay I give him the benefit of the doubt because he had to get his drink order to his table. No that's is not where it stopped. He then was talking shit about me and my child to his fellow coworker saying this bitch and her kids almost made me drop my glasses. I kid you not the other server had a look of horror realizing that he heard what he said. Whatever, I ignored it and went on to the bath room. When I got back to the table our server Max was irritated we where in his section, had no personality, and you could tell by his demeanor he wanted nothing to do with us in his section. We ordered, got our food and then noticed something very disturbing with where and how they store their Parmesan cheese they gladly sprinkle on your food. Last time I checked that kind of cheese should be far from your POS (point of service system) & on ice to keep it fresh. No it was sitting in an open container next to the POS and out in the open and made me think that if they are doing this small of thing out in the open, what does their kitchen look like or their coolers where they keep everything?  Max could have cared less about his guest and the only he was happy was when he decided to get his tip! He and his bearded buddy (the one that was talking crap) treated the bus boy so badly, never helped him pre bus his tables and left it all for him to clean. There were 8 tables with people sitting at them with empty glasses, tables filled with empty plates and these servers just stood there chit chatting with one another. The funny thing is my mom is a server so we get the whole restaurant process. My message to management, walk around your establishment and see what's going on, then maybe you'll see the cracks in your service so that your servers will actually treat their customers right, and the way your male staff treat your hard working bus staff better. My advice to the servers, be very cautious to who you wait on, you never know who they are or what they do for a living! After all you are working to make a living and are NOT entitled to being tipped for shitty service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook?start=60

I'm gluten free and I ordered a side salad and croutons were in there.  Got a sad apology, that was major f*** up and all I got was apology.  She should have taken it off our bill.  If I eat gluten I got sick and all I got was a sad apology 2. We sat at a high top that was horribly uncomfortable.  Everyone around us said this is the worst seating they have ever sat.  Terrible for kids and adults. Thin bench, just horrible 3. The service was okay; our waitress was friendly but would disappear for a long time.  For instance my salad issue; 10 minutes after it was brought to me she came by.  Annoying!  Plus it took us over 90 minutes to eat there on our lunch break 4. Pricey!!  I got a gluten free pizza and a side salad with tax and tip it was $30.  That's crazy!  I should have eaten at reel club or the clubhouse and gotten a better meal The food: Wasn't bad, I didn't say good.  If my meal was $10 then I would be less critical.  I got the house salad, I'm glad I substituted spinach for the romaine otherwise it would have been a total rip off.  The salad was $7, it had spinach, some diced tomato and carrots, dressing and that's it!  The dressing was good but another rip off.  The gluten free pizza dough was actually pretty good.  The toppings sucked!  The pepperoni was cheap nasty crap you find at the dollar store, the sausage was okay, cheese tasted like frozen pizza cheese and the mushrooms and the basil were burnt.  The dough was good but unfortunately the pizza sucked overall!  My coworkers agreed there food was just okay.

Dimples R.,"Aurora, IL",24,50,73,3.0,8/26/2015,"California Pizza Kitchen is located in the 2nd level right outside of Nordstrom.

Over the weekend we are here and we have the lettuce wrap, Tuscan hummus and Thai Crunch salad. Another one of my favorite are the fish tacos and fresh strawberry mango cooler (very refreshing drink and without any alcohol). Again the food was great but service was rather slow and the restaurant was not even filled when we got there. We rarely see our server and she would just show up to check on us and ask how the food was. Service really needs to improve!  The place got renovated too which is nice, new floors and tables but I wish (being a mom to a toddler) they would renovate the washroom.

I was pleasantly surprised actually - the dish was a little too spicy, but there were generous portions of shrimp, chicken and andouille sausage. Also, breaking from tradition a bit, they serve it on a bed of pasta instead of rice, which was fine, but made it even more filling than normal, I didn't even finish half of it.

Our waitress was fine, not outstanding but fine.  For an app we had the guacamole which was not very guacamole-like.  It was described as having jicama, corn, and jalapeno(?) peppers in it.  I was working under the assumption that it would still be predominantly mashed avocado and a little of the other stuff.  Instead it was equally all of the aforementioned items which was odd.  For pizza, I had the cheeseburger pizza which I thought and hoped would be like the frozen kind I got in the store.  Unfortunately it was not that good.  The hamburger tasted kind of fatty and it just wasn't as good as the frozen kind.  The other problem I had with it was the frozen kind comes with diced tomatoes and in the restaurant apparently they can only do sliced tomato (which I don't like).  Also, on the box when you get it in the store it suggest shredded lettuce with mayo (which they had on here) and diced pickles (which they did not have available).  I assumed there would be pickles available or I wouldn't have ordered it (the sourness helps balance everything out).  My husband got the BBQ chicken which I think is also better frozen.  I think we just got water to drink and that was refilled adequately.   I most likely will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook?start=100

Tara M.,"Des Plaines, IL",91,355,7,4.0,11/26/2007,"I'm not the norm, I figured that there was little other than pizza on the menu, so why bother popping in... well, wasn't I pleasantly surprised!  I hate having to wait for a table, but the Saturday after Thanksgiving at one in the afternoon proved not nearly as bad a wait as I'd anticipated.  Then the service was great, our server was at our table within a few moment of us being seated and was quick with our drinks.  The food was good too!  Plus, when I really want a salad, but not A LOT of salad, it's nice to have the option to get a 'half' of a salad.    And then there's the fact that they have some of the BEST spinach/artichoke dip I've ever had... YUM! Will definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook?start=100
Jessica D.,"Arlington Heights, IL",161,817,56,4.0,6/29/2007,"Yes, this is a chain. Yes, they train the personnel to act and speak alike any location you go. Yes, they have the same menu items. But don't ask me why, this is the best spot I've been in for CPK, counting somewhere in Hawaii, somewhere in Virginia, the one downtown at Water Tower and even the brand spanking new one in Warrenville IL. Maybe it's the possibility of sitting by the really big ovalish window and peeking down onto unsuspecting parked cars. Or maybe the possibility of sitting by the window and peeking at Nordstrom customers. Maybe I'm just into daylight and windows? Just my favorite location. The staff is fast, the food is well-cooked, they come back and ask you how it's going they don't leave you orphaned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook?start=100
Joe C.,"Chicago, IL",3,79,16,1.0,6/2/2011,"tried to order 7 minutes ago.....guess they don't like customers money and choose to let a call sit on hold for 5 minutes then come on the line and say were closed.... BEFORE 9 . I wouldn't waste time there, call some other place, at least service would probably be better",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook?start=100
Shayna W.,"Boise City, ID",126,58,19,4.0,5/4/2009,"I visited the Pizza Kitchen for lunch during a business trip and found the food and service very good.  The restaurant was clean, the staff was friendly and I liked the well lit, open but fairly quiet atmosphere.  The cooking area was open and it was fun to look over and see pizza's being made.  I had the Thai Chicken Salad and the raspberry iced tea.  The tea seemed to be regular tea with ""flavoring"" as she gave me a spoon with it and I don't think it was worth $2.99 but the meal was tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook?start=120
Dasha O.,"Brookfield, IL",15,19,,4.0,6/1/2012,"I usually go to CPK with friends and enjoy a good dining experience. I like to order the Mushroom Pizza or the Greek Pizza - vegetarian style. This last time, I had the artichoke dip and chips along with the fried mac n cheese. Service is quick and the staff is o.k. I like the fact that refills on the soft drinks are free. A couple of times it has been really crowded or the music has been playing too loudly. One time my friend was billed nearly triple what we actually should have paid. The error was discovered after we left the restaurant. He had no issue getting it fixed but still!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook?start=120
Maureen M.,"Oak Lawn, IL",0,3,,1.0,3/22/2014,"Today I had a pretty miserable experience at CPK. It is only my second time here. The first time was because my sister threw a party here for my nieces birthday. We went because at the party my children received coupons for a free build-your-own-pizza which is a great way to bring people back to try it again with their families. However, although yes it may have been busy, they said my kids couldn't build their own pizza because it was ""too busy""? Why send a coupon if you can not hold true to it? Anyways, we looked past it. The kids got over it and the kitchen just made their pizza for them. Me and my mom decided to split a salad and a pizza. The kids food came out, then our salad came out. The salad was very good (California Cobb). We were starting to wonder when the pizza was coming. Once everyone was done with everything the waitress asked if we wanted her to send the kids desserts over. I said ""can you just wait a little bit til we get our pizza?"" And that's when it happened. She looked very puzzled and was like ""pizza?"" Then she went over to the computer and ordered it, clearly Bc she had forgotten. I have been in the restaurant industry for my whole life. If she would have said ""my fault I totally forgot to ring it in"" ""or I'll have it out right away"" or ANYTHING to fix the mistake we would have been fine with it. However, it was busy, the kids were done eating, and then she came over and told us that someone took the pizza? Really?! Like someone just took the pizza? You don't have tickets? Or tables numbers? Or managers? Is the kitchen a free for all? The point is, is that just fess up, tell the manager and fix the problem. But instead, you have created a poor experience and a loss of customers when there is so many restaurants to choose from. Sorry for the bad review and Good luck CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook?start=120
