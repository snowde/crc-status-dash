John S.,"San Francisco, CA",787,2239,504,3.0,1/7/2017,"It's overpriced airport pizza, so what do you expect?  I mean, CPK literally invented the entire business model, and they live up to their own low standards, so I don't feel that three stars are too many. Both employees I spoke with were nice.  The pizza came out quick.  I still prefer Firewood closer to Terminal 1, but this CPK is nowhere near as bad as it could be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oakland
Daniel C.,"Danville, CA",611,1151,6214,4.0,7/14/2016,"Updated review -  Their Hawaiian Pizza was pretty darn good!  13 minutes and right out of the oven and loaded with Canadian Bacon, pineapple, cheese, and just enough tomato sauce to keep in balanced. One reason it cooks fast is that its a smaller, barely 12"" diameter pizza that a hungry person can probably finish.  It's also good for two people looking for a pre-flight snack. Averaging my experience from last time, I'm happy to upgrade to 4 stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oakland
Robert F.,"Overland Park, KS",156,175,70,4.0,8/17/2016,"I dunno if I can really do a fair review for this.  I ordered a Margarita pizza while in the airport as well as a beer.  They took my order quickly and before long I had a delicous version (yes the Margarita which almost every pizza maker has one, comes in many different versions!) of the pizza.  The beer was cold and refreshing and went terrific with pizza.  (I am however too lazy to find out which beer on Untapped that I had.) Anyway they are above average even on a crowded day.  They only get four because they are located in an Airport and so seating and ambiance suffered. BTW:After reviewing a couple of other reviews...  ITS PIZZA so it will be greasy and quick!  IT IS IN AN AIRPORT!!!  So of course it will be pricey... if you want cheap don't eat ANYTHING in an airport!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oakland
Natalia D.,"Glendale, CA",52,34,361,2.0,7/25/2017,"The lady at the register was rude. She didn't greet any of the customers nor did she crack a smile from the moment I ordered up until the 20 minutes it took for me to get my order. You're charging me an arm and a leg for pizza that I had to wait 20 minutes for, your employees shouldn't make my experience even more unpleasant. At least the guy making the pizza was nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oakland
Ron R.,"Livermore, CA",1198,693,7955,3.0,5/25/2015,"Write while I wait! Right across my gate! Okay, that's about the only Oakland rap you'll get out of me :)  ~ About this location: Simply a convenient CPK with packaged sandwiches, salads, fruits, refreshments, and of course pizza!  This location sits across Gate 28, Southwest Terminal 2.  ~ Above average prices for what you get, but what do'ya expect!  I ordered the Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage pizza for $12.51.  Like WOW for a Totino sized pizza!  Yippee skippy (sarcasm)! ~ Service was ok, no issue. No smile, no rush, next customer!   ~ The highlight is watching your pizza get baked in the flamin' hot oven.   Tip: The Gordon Biersch a little further down has a brat and beer special.  I'd head over there instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oakland
Kaori T.,"Burbank, CA",1494,793,1274,4.0,7/30/2015,"Not saying much cause it's airport food and my pizza was greasy as hell, but I give it four stars cause it was full of flavor, piping hot and saved me when I was starving. They make the pizza fresh, it goes straight into the oven after ordering instead of hanging out under a heat lamp for a while. A little pricey but it's airport again. I think best quick airport food you can get at the OAK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oakland
Jessica C.,"Laguna Hills, CA",10,63,5,1.0,11/14/2016,"The only reason they get a star is because they were open...crappy staff, everything is pre-made (wtf?) and no pizza because ""they are on break""....WTF????",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oakland
Erica C.,"Escondido, CA",34,14,,1.0,5/20/2016,"I'm sorry. I don't write reviews too often but the terrible-ness of this pizza literally forced my hand.  Where should I start? Well, to begin with it costs $10 plus tax for a tiny, personal sized cheese pizza -- which, spoiler alert, tastes like microwaved cardboard. If you're craving a texture other than gloppy erasers, you'll have to spend $15. Airport prices. I get it. Except the crust is crappily thin, nearly burnt to a crisp, and has zero flavor. The tomato sauce tastes like it came from a can, and the cheese doesn't make the pizza taste any better. It's lumpy, misshapen, and overall just makes me wish I starved instead. A bag of chips would taste better than this expensive bullshit. I tried to trick myself into thinking the $11 I spent was sorta worth it. Needless to say, I failed. This pizza is just that bad. TLDR get yourself to Burger King and treat yourself to a delicious combo meal for half the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oakland
Janice N.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,50,,1.0,4/17/2017,Prices are outrageous.  It's highway robbery just because you're in an airport. I wish there were some regulations on how much airport restaurants can charge.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oakland

Bryan G.,"Meridian, ID",135,86,35,4.0,9/30/2014,"Only reason I enjoy flying into Oakland is a chance to eat some CPK in this airport. It's directly off of the southwest gates so if you fly that airline you'll be very close.  CPK,  is one of my favorite California meal locations. Although this location isn't on par with actual standalone locations,  it still gets high marks given what it is. Wait times are usually quoted as 14 minutes and it's pretty accurate. If you have a connection I wouldn't recommend this as a dining option. Remember most planes board 30 minutes from scheduled departure.  If you do have the time enjoy some fresh cooked pizza. Although the pizzas are pre prepared they are cooked to order in an open fire oven. The selection is decent with most popular pies getting billing.  Expect to pay around 10 to 16 dollars depending if you get a drink or not.  Overall I always stop here If I have the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oakland
David L.,"Arcadia, CA",233,64,5,4.0,3/5/2016,"After eating at another place in the airport and realizing that I was still hungry, I shamelessly made a trip to this place to find more food. I ordered a pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom pizza. It ended up filling me up. The taste is what you expect from any airport pizza. The wait was about 10 minutes for the pizza even though nobody was in line. The place also has a 2% surcharge for something. It ended up being 28 cents.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oakland
Anthony S.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",16,12,,1.0,11/25/2016,I should've read the reviews first. Place is run by employees that clearly do not want to be there. Poor attitudes and just rude.

Kasia G.,"Carmel, CA",27,91,170,4.0,5/23/2014,"I just ran .5 of a mile to get this pizza. Haven't tried it yet but running & getting my pizza only took 20 minutes. I was bummed out that it was too early for non breakfast pizzas when I arrived. Only egg pizzas were being served & I was about to lose it! BUT, the 3 employees working all decided to open up the lunch menu for me at 8:30am. Yay!  I wanted a nice fluffy Hawaiian pizza & as I look at it, it looks pretty good. Can't be as good as the actual restaurant dining in so that's why 4 stars but glad I got my pizza fix for my flight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oakland
Joan Marie Y.,"Albuquerque, NM",469,46,16,4.0,1/12/2016,"I'm always looking for dog friendly places and here is another one! Now you can't take them inside but you're allowed to have them on the patio. The service is great for you and your dog. Each time I've gone the servers have always offered water and a friendly head scratch for my little guy. The food is great, I'm a fan of the pizza, the salads, the pasta and the drinks. That might be the whole menu but it's totally a great place. Either for one or for a group. I've gone with my friends, my friends and dog, my friends and our dogs and just myself, each experience has been great. I highly recommend going there when in the area. It's in the heart of the shopping center too so it's a great location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oakland
Kenneth R.,"Berkeley, CA",755,1190,171,2.0,8/21/2013,"Oakland's Terminal 2 is looking pretty good these days.  For reasons that I can't reconstruct, I ended up at the California Pizza Kitchen after looking at other options that seemed more attractive.  I went for the lunch combo that includes a small soup and a half-sandwich. Neither was especially good.  I began with a tortilla soup that seemed unnaturally thick; I wondered how much corn starch or flour had been poured into it.  Thankfully, the tortilla strips were served on the side and were not already waterlogged when I sat down to eat the soup.  The other half of the combo was a tuna salad sandwich that came pre-made and pre-wrapped.  The bread was accordingly kinda soggy, and the tuna salad was OK at best. California Pizza Kitchen would be a standout at the United gates as Dulles Airport but does not come across as a winner in the current T2 lineup.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oakland
Kevin S.,"Ashburn, VA",120,703,414,1.0,5/15/2013,"Terrible. This place is a disgrace to the CPK name.   My family and I LOVE CPK and were SO excited when we found out there was a CPK at the airport when we had a layover there.   DON'T BOTHER. I think the pizzas are pre-made somewhere else and then brought to the airport because they had a limited inventory of each type.  They were out of most of the types we wanted and we settled for what was left in stock.  After placing our order and paying for it, the employee at the counter subsequently informed us, ""We're out of that, too.""  We had to downgrade to plain cheese pizza, and he didn't even offer to refund us the difference in price since we had paid for a pizza with something else besides cheese on it.   When the pizza came it was NOT fresh.  The pizza was overcooked.  The crust was hard and crunchy.  In short, this was NOT CPK by any stretch of the imagination. Save your money.  Go get some nasty premade airport sandwich in the newsstand fridge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oakland
Amanda D.,"Vancouver, WA",3,5,,1.0,3/30/2015,"I fly from the Oakland airport every two weeks. Often, my gate is right next to CPK. I actually make a game out of the terrible service people receive from this location. Often, someone at the register is ignoring a line of people wanting to make a purchase. Today I watched a line of 5 people dwindle down to one from people lacking patience while waiting for the staff to finish their conversation to be helped. Then I watch the successfully patient customers as they receive their order incorrectly and have to argue with the staff to get it corrected.  This ""game"" has entertained me for a year now. I strongly believe the owner of this location needs to question how the staff is representing cpk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oakland

Jennifer D.,"Houston, TX",313,81,5,3.0,10/30/2013,"Some times, you have to cave in and get overpriced airport food. As I made my way past all the different food spots, I saw the familiar yellow CPK sign. ""YES! YES! YES!,"" my tummy shouted. I arrived at the counter, and two workers were by the oven. I waited by the cashier for about a minute, and no one acknowledged me. So, I spoke up and asked the workers, ""Are you guys open right now?"" That got their attention, and they finally took my order. I ordered the BBQ chicken, which took about 10 minutes to bake.  The pizza was good enough - the same taste that I am familiar with, but warm instead of fresh-out-of-the-oven, which is weird because it supposedly JUST came out of the oven. Better than most food court pizzerias, but definitely not CPK-standard.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oakland?start=20

I purchased their Pair It which you can choose half of a sandwich and a cup of soup. I chose the tuna sandwich and smashed pea and barely soup. The tuna sandwich tasted decent. It wasn't the best I've ever had but if I had to, I could have it again. The pea soup was delish. Very hot, full of flavor, and had texture from the peas and barely.  The customer service was poor.
