Adama A.,"Omaha, NE",205,13,,4.0,2/23/2010,"Shockingly, during a Nebraska football game...this place is dormant. (then again who would want to be eating pizza for two-three hours at their bar.)  Might be a nice place to go if you are into Nebraska football and California pizza and want to spend a lot of time there. When you walk in, the place is very presentable.  A lot of open space so you don't feel like you are crowded. You can watch the cooks make your pizza which is nice too. Plenty of pizza choices, though I wish I chose something else because it was to rich for me...but the ingredients I had made it rich...so it's my fault...not theirs. Really no cons...but not a 5 star place. Definitely would come back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-omaha
Sarah G.,"Omaha, NE",56,989,1431,4.0,5/30/2009,"I definitely am a fan of the CPK.  Although a little on the pricy side, the gourmet pizzas are worth it and I find it hard not to get the chocolate banana cake too..  I never leave disappointed, and if you want to try something new but don't like it, let them know as they'll automatically fix it or bring one you know you like. Lunch was crazy busy, so I don't really recommend going during the weekday lunch rush.  Weekends and evenings are much more reasonable.  And they have a patio so you can watch the Strip Mall traffic pass by...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-omaha
Manoj R.,"Omaha, NE",5,117,9,3.0,2/24/2010,"Although I'm a big fan of fusion food, CPK is not my thing. Service as well as ambiance is very good. For eg, Taco or thai pizza is not my thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-omaha
Kim J.,"Omaha, NE",63,328,231,3.0,7/29/2008,"I've long been a fan of CPK, eating there years ago at one in Atlanta.  THis place is pretty yuppified.  And, I agree with the other reviewers that it does seem very overpriced.    I do enjoy the pizza and they have a good kids menu with several pizzas and pastas, including mac and cheese.   They offer lemonade with various fruit flavors which is a bit hit with my kids and husband.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-omaha
Daniel A.,"Mebane, NC",14,163,15,4.0,4/13/2007,"This is a pretty good place for lunch, although it can get pretty busy, so you probably want to come early or later. We went here today, actually, we had set out to try Wheatfields based on the recommendation here on Yelp, but when we got there it was still busy (1:30pm) and really looked a bit more upscale then we were looking for since our 3 year old was with us. Anyway, we were able to get immediate seating, which was nice, and they provided crayons and a children's menu that you can color in, which was good to keep our daughter busy until the food came. They don't have chicken strips on their kid's menu, I found this a bit odd, but probably a good thing since my kids invariably eat chicken strips whenever we go out, and I have to convince the older two to try other menu items since they seem to automatically get the chicken strips everytime we are out. My wife had some Thai noodle special with shrimp, and I had a pepperoni ""neapolitan"" pizza.  Strangly enough, this did not turn out to be chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry flavored, but rather was a nice, light thin pizza, which was perfect for a late lunch. The portion size was appropriate, and the pricing was ok.  Service was helpful and friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-omaha
Charles G.,"Omaha, NE",4,130,,1.0,7/19/2008,"Someone told us it was good, so we went.  That person was wrong.  Horrific and overpriced.  Avoid this place if you like real pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-omaha
