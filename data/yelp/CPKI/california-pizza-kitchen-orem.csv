Jamie B.,"Orem, UT",2,36,1,4.0,10/15/2017,Still great cpk food.  Came on a Sunday.  Place is a bit dirty. Crumbs on my table and the wooden tops between the tables left a trail of pretty thick dust when I ran my hand over it. You could see the dust clearly. Maybe a little attention to detail is needed. Looking a little run down.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem
Caitlin D.,"Provo, UT",46,20,18,4.0,7/18/2017,"Delicious pizza and pasta.  My personal favorite was their pear gorganzola pizza and cauliflower buffalo wings- to die for! They don't skimp on the cocktail ratios! ;) They make a rock solid moscow mule.

Jaymie P.,"Breckenridge, CO",0,78,18,1.0,12/28/2017,"I love CPK, this review is just for the managers at this location. We came in last night waited 15 minutes for menus, never got our appetizers or waters, adults food came way before children. It wasn't very busy but they were clearly either understaffed or their managers weren't doing their job, I think it was both. Our server was clearly in the weeds running around like crazy. Meanwhile, two women managers underdressed with messy buns are just chatting away near the kitchen line in   La la land for about 20 minutes. I just stared at them in disbelief as the servers are all tripping over one another, I felt really bad for them. Finally,  I asked our host if he would send the manger over, we were currently waiting for sides of ranch, waters and kids foods, she didn't bring anything over except her apologies. After she left we were still waiting, but she did bring us $15 gift cards and again, without our waters or ranch, lol it's almost hilarious if it weren't so frustrating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem
Sheri R.,"Orem, UT",88,117,520,4.0,9/8/2016,"It seems like a lot of times I forget that this place is even around. But when I go I really do enjoy it. Albeit a bit overpriced. But the portions are good. I usually go home with at least half of my pizza. And the salads are quite large. A half salad is easily shared between 2-3 people if you're wanting something else as well. I love the Jamaican jerk chicken pizza, although I ask for the hand tossed crust instead of the thin. Cause the hand tossed is thin too! Many family members of mine love the BBQ chicken pizza. For this trip, we also really liked the BBQ chicken chopped salad, the white corn guacamole, and my friend tried the new farmers market soup and loved it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem
Chyryry ..,"American Fork, UT",49,60,130,5.0,3/9/2017,"Love the lunch specials! You get personal pizza, and soup or salad for just under $11. I got the roasted veggie pizza and the farmers market soup, which is a squash based soup. Both the pizza and the soup has great flavors. Both are good options for vegetarians or vegans. You can also have them hold the cheese. I guess that's a usually there. The portion sizes are good. I am leaving feeling full and satisfied. I will be back. Service was great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem
Dallin S.,"South San Francisco, CA",10,3,,5.0,6/1/2017,My waitress Tay was super tan and a great server. I loved the pizza. I loved it a little too much. Great atmosphere.

Paige H.,"Provo, UT",0,4,,5.0,8/15/2017,"My mother and I went to eat here for her birthday, and we loved it! The pizza is to die for, literally mouth watering. We got the asparagus & arugula salad, so fresh and yummy! Our waiter was very nice and helpful with explaining the menu to us since it was our first time eating there. We then came a second time for dinner cause we were craving the pizza!! We got curbside take-out and Aaron helped us out, such great customer service and professionalism. They ran out of key lime pie and offered us another dessert on them, which I find very nice they didn't have to do that. Overall we've only had great experiences here!

Emily F.,"Pleasant Grove, UT",31,9,11,2.0,7/3/2017,"Probably the worst dining experience that we have ever had. We came around 12 in the afternoon there were probably five tables full. The waitress ignored us and it wasn't until we got the manager involved did she even come by. She helped all the tables around us and was very nice to them but when it came to us and our table she was very curt. She explicitly said she would watch our drinks and come refill them, which she did not. Arrived at our table letting us know she had the check in a tone that she just wanted us to leave. If she didn't like being a server why work as one. We will never be eating at this CPK again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem
Will B.,"American Fork, UT",49,206,335,4.0,2/29/2016,"I've written a review of the CPK downtown and like most chains going to one is like going to every other one.  This time my wife had the Chicken Waldorf Salad and said it was very good.  I had the thin crust meat lovers and it was amazing.  So pretty much what I expect from every CPK I have been to.  What made this particular location special was that even though I have always had good service, this location had GREAT service.  The staff was amazing.  I do wish they had a better draft beer selection though.  The location downtown has a selection of draft but here it was only Blue Moon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem

Stephanie H.,"Orem, UT",66,38,17,3.0,8/17/2016,Great food today at CPK! Nice quiet atmosphere in the early afternoon. I must recommend the butter cake with ice cream on top! Absolutely the best dessert I have had in a long long time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem
Ernst W.,"Pacific Grove, CA",0,197,,4.0,4/19/2017,"We had Roasted Veggie salad which was as good as at California Pizza Kitchen at home, one of our favorites. The Mushroom Pepperoni pizza we tried was very good. They had a new item ""Wild Mushroom Strozzapreti"" which we liked very much, wished the serving was a bit larger. It was a good choice, away from home, having an idea what type of dishes they have that we may like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem
Daniella P.,"Vista, CA",48,39,4,4.0,8/14/2017,"We went on a Sunday, it was very quiet. The food was pretty good, their BBQ chicken pizza is still the favorite for sure. I usually like their smashed pea/barley soup but it was a bit bland that day. The waiter was super friendly, I should have taken note if his name! What I like about CPK is that it has a variety of foods in the menu so if you go with a large group, like we did, it is easy for everyone to find something they like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem
Camille P.,"Rexburg, ID",29,11,8,5.0,1/18/2017,"I would recommend this place to everyone! My family and I have been going to CPK for as long as I can remember. And the one thing that I love is that the service at each location is always outstanding! The staff at CPK are always on point. For example, right when you walk in you're immediately greeted by their friendly hosts! The servers I've had are knowledgeable and efficient.  And the food is too die for! The portions are big, so you get what you're paying for, and the ingredients are always fresh! If you haven't been to this location in a while I would recommend on trying it out! You won't be disappointed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem
Katy B.,"Saratoga Springs, UT",31,158,11,2.0,10/9/2015,"I think I've finally removed this place from my ""would go"" list. It has a lot going for it and the food by itself is usually quite good. But it is just overcome by too many little things that add up. Service is friendly but very slow. Portion sizes are small and way too expensive for what you get. Also, I'm still mad at them for ditching the Italian sodas from their menu. The desserts, on the other hand, are great. I'd recommend the tiramisu or butter cake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem
Rod S.,"Orem, UT",193,757,603,4.0,3/13/2016,"My how things must have changed since Ed LaDou created the first CPK menu that did include the Chicken BBQ Pizza. This is really standard style pizza with CA style toppings. It's not gourmet CA pizza. P712 does that at a similar price. This was my second trip in the last year, and my second trip period. I have no memory what I ate on the first trip, it wasn't memorable. I decided I should order a pizza. It is technically a Pizza place. I got the Mushroom, Pepperoni, and Italian Sausage pizza. There is a reference to it having wild oregano in it. Apparently that's a reference to someone going wild with the dried Oregano. The Oregano was stronger than it should be. As expected, the sauce is somewhat sweet like standard Pizza. The crust and cook was good. All in all, a solid American chain pizza in a nice location with a pretty good wine list by the glass and bottle. My wifes garlic pasta with shrimp was cooked pretty close to al dente and the shrimp were not over done (well done CPK). It's not likely to be a regular on the rotation, but it's no longer on my list of places not to go. I was there on a Sunday with not a lot of people. I can't imagine making the effort to be there on a busy night, and I expect the food may suffer. I think that's why the previous trip was forgettable. It was a busy night and we were at the bar to bypass the line.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem
Ryan B.,"Provo, UT",0,42,1,1.0,6/30/2016,"Wow. It started off great. We were there at 5pm with a group of 6 and completely beat the dinner rush. Still, it took awhile before they brought around the bread, and the food took a noticeably long time to come out. Once it did come out, the waiter made a rookie blunder by making the tray unbalanced and half our food hit the deck. (2 pizzas and 1 pasta).  It took forever again but the pizzas eventually came out. They forgot the pasta. That too eventually came out, but we were already done.  I wanted to see how they would handle this. They gave us 3 vouchers for free small plates. Which you can get online pretty much anytime anyways. You can't use all 3 vouchers at the same time... We would have to come back 3 times to use them. They should have comped those dishes. The food was consistent with previous CPK experiences, but we will never be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem
Vish U.,"Lehi, UT",18,149,346,4.0,8/1/2015,"Great service, awesome pizzas and I would definitely try their margarita pizza for sure as well as their dessert selection. Definitely worth the price and drive in my opinion",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem
Greg M.,"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT",190,253,5,3.0,1/2/2016,Okay pizza.  Good service a bar area you can sit at quickly.  Typically an hour wait.  Just the way it is in Orem.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem

Charles W.,"Lindon, UT",0,19,,3.0,1/27/2012,"The food at CPK is overall really flavorful and pleasant.  The service is hit-or-miss.  I suspect that a lot of the appetizers are frozen.  The pizza is of course what this place is known for and where it really shines.  I think this might be my favorite crust in all of pizza-dom.  They have a solid line-up of gourmet pizzas that should please everyone.  Disappointed they did away with the carne asada pizza, but there are plenty of others that are equally good.  Flavored lemonades are average.  Overall, you will probably feel that you are overpaying a bit.  Solid 3-star place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem?start=40
Mark S.,"Jerome, ID",6,56,3,3.0,6/3/2011,Food was okay but the service was not good. It took 45 minute to bring our food and on top of that they included an 18% gratuity which was definitely not earned.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem?start=40
Nic J.,"Pleasant Grove, UT",11,5,1,5.0,2/22/2009,Excellent Neapolitan-style pizza. We had the pesto chicken pizza with basil and sun-dried tomatoes. It was delicious.  Family said the Waldorf salad is also awesome.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem?start=40

Erin Q.,"Austin, TX",24,181,2,5.0,3/22/2009,"I can't help but start out by mentioning the movie I saw directly after coming to CPK tonight. So I went to see Knowing tonight. The movie started out pretty good. The majority of it was suspenseful and entertaining. About fifteen minutes before the end of the film, everything fell apart. I won't give up anything too big for those of you who are still raring to see it, but seriously? The ending was HORRIBLE. It actually had me bowing my head, begging for it to stop for the purpose of trying to save Nicholas Cage's credibility (whatever is left of it after Ghost Rider) and to put me out of my misery. But I must say that it did make me laugh a lot for all of the wrong reasons. The ending was even worse and more dramatic than the ending of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Yikes. As one girl walking out of the theatre put it, ""That was the stupidest ending to a movie I have ever seen"". All right, I digress... CPK is an awesome place to frequent around these parts. Since discovering their soups, I can't help but order two in a bowl every time I come. The sedona chicken and adobe chicken chowder are the best, which makes the two in a bowl all the more convenient and enjoyable. While I'm not a big fan of the red velvet cake, all of my friends think its amazing. One of the best things about CPK is the service. The servers at this location are the best around. Even if you have a wait, it's typically not terrible, and the servers really get everything to you quickly and without error.  I just wish that I had come here after the movie so that I could have continued to comment with my friends on how wretched the ending is. I'll give you two more items of the movie that were horrible: the acting of one of the chicks was absolutely horrible (granted, some of this could be a faulty screenplay, but no, this was just her) - ""We MUST save the CHILDREN!"". Also, there's a point where Nicholas Cage has an unnecessarily wide leg stance. I tell ya, that's distracting. Wow, I got back into discussing the movie. Sorry, folks, but that movie is worth criticizing through yelp.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem?start=40
Pernilla K.,"Shoreline, WA",9,36,10,2.0,5/26/2010,"I was going to put a 3 star, but then considering the prices here for _pizza_ you'd kinda expect a bit more than mediocre food and service. Ironically, I never went to CPK when I lived in the Bay Area, but since this one was close by I decided to try it out with my boyfriend.  Location? Conveniently just by University Mall, but also means parking availability depends on when you come here.  Food?  Nothing you'd write home to grandma about. It's basically overpriced pizza that doesn't really taste anything special. I had the BBQ Chicken with Apple Smoked Bacon, which wasn't bad, but it wasn't really worth the price and same with the Meat Cravers that my boyfriend ordered (which we didn't know was spicy, but he likes spicy food so w/e). We also ordered a Pineapple Colada and a beer.  OK, no one cares what me or my company ate, but this is slightly necessary as it's time to discuss the service. (which you may ignore if you don't give a rat's ass about service) To start off, the waitress showing us the table was friendly, however we barely had the chance to pick up the menus, our waiter already came over and asked us what we'd like to order for drinks. No recommendations/suggestions, just what we'd like to order.  Now with just a beer and spicy food, you might want a glass of water, yes? Or at least need more than one bottle of beer. Heck even without that, if you're still eating your dinner and the drinks are empty your waiter/waitress should be asking the customer if they need a refill. And no, the fact our waiter was too busy hitting on the guy's girlfriend at the next table is unfortunately not good enough of an excuse. We were barely finished with our food, and just chatting while considering if we should eat another slice or box the food, and it was almost as if he wanted us to pay and leave right away.  Adding along with the fact that it wasn't busy at all, the service definitely gets a thumbs down. If the food tasted better, I wouldn't rate this as poorly. But the service was very minimal, and the food didn't taste good enough for me to forgive the bad service. So conclusion, if you like overpriced mediocre pizza and minimal service - Welcome to CPK. (Although their Pineapple Colada had fresh pineapple on it, which I loved... ...nope still a 2 star.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem?start=40

Freddy Z.,"Orem, UT",36,7,15,5.0,3/8/2016,"I came in to CPK with my wife because a friend of mine told me that they were revamping the menu, and so I thought it would be a great excuse to take my wife out on a date. I was starving when I came in so asked the server what app he recommends, and he said I should try the avocado egg rolls. I ordered those and they really were good. They were light and had tons of different flavors. Bacon, avocado, chicken, tomato, chz and they came with two hefty side dishes of ranch and Chipolte?  For the entree my wife ordered the roasted garlic chicken and I ordered the new Ribeye. I noticed that the chicken breast she ordered came with fried Skin! Yum. She let me take a bite and it was as good as it looked! My Ribeye was perfect. I think it was a 12 oz but it was a nice thick cut, and the garlic butter on top was so good.  Me and my wife ate everything, and we were stuffed. But a good stuffed, like we were totally satisfied stuffed. Even though I was stuffed; if you would have put another one of those entrees in front of me I still would have taken another bite and I would have exploded. I haven't left a restaurant that full but satisfied in I don't know how long.  I think the new menu is a game changer for this place. It has been known for more than pizza for quite some time but now it's going to be known for much much more.

Chase B.,"Provo, UT",45,80,29,2.0,10/9/2015,"Would give it 3 stars, but the recent menu change (this used to be a decent place to get Italian soda), the steep prices with small portion sizes, and the way service breaks down any time they get remotely full (20 to 30 minute wait just for bread sometimes) all combine to knock a star off.

Dean P.,"Park City, UT",0,29,11,2.0,7/4/2016,This location has been consistently poor for service. We've been here three times. We love the Margarita Pizza and Cobb Salads. Today 4th of July was more of the same poor service. We were sat and waited for anyone to acknowledge we were there. If there is a manager-they aren't doing anything. We ended up walking out.    We've been to dozens of CPK's and rarely had such poor service. Millennial servers are often clueless and self-absorbed. We went to PF Chang's next door and were greater by the waiter there in 30 seconds after being seated.

Alayzain R.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,5,,5.0,1/18/2017,"MORE THAN JUST A REVIEW: My father recently had the pleasure to stop in CPK for an afternoon lunch. Lunch time for him occurred right after his Radiation/Chemotherapy treatment. After treatment, he was delighted with a wonderful conversation with a waiter by the name of Jake who could relate with my father due to recent tender loss of his aunt, who was battling cancer just like my father. Typically, clients and waiters/waitress usually have tender, small talk. This was not the case, Jake had such an empathic way with dealing with the illness that most recently plagued our morals as a family.  it not only brought tears and emotions to my dad and it also brought tears to everyone else on the table. As the meal went on, little to our surprise the meal was covered by the staff of CPK. As we fought to rebuttal the free meal, the staff was firm on their kind gesture and their only request was to see my father again. Not for business, but for hope. THIS REVIEW DOES NOT DO THIS CPK LOCATION JUSTICE.

Only 15 showed up. We got there early, decorated, set up... Absolutely none of the servers offered to help us set up or anything. My waitress was 19 and had no idea what kind of alcohol they served. Maybe they thought that bringing us plates and plates of bread would distract us from the fact that it took you over an hour to get our food cooked? It didn't. Not to mention that no one came back to refill our beverages all dinner. Then, toward the end of the evening, a waiter has the audacity to come up and ask us to consolidate ourselves because they needed the tables. Excuse me? I know that we reserved this area for a private party. Honestly, what are you thinking? The entire area is decorated for a bridal shower right now. My sister's bridal shower. To add insult to injury, the waitress completely ignored us after the check was paid. We had to seek her out to ask her to clear the table so that my sister could open the gifts. Honestly, do you really put a brand-new waitress on a party of 15? Or are all of your servers that incompetent? I was extremely disappointed, and will not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem?start=20
Mrs D.,"American Fork, UT",0,41,16,4.0,9/18/2013,Eat here quite often.  Over the years the service has consistently stayed mediocre at best & makes me wonder who is training these servers!?!  Food & atmosphere is good enough that it keeps us coming back even with service generally below average.  As a standard their turnaround time in getting your order back out to you is and always has been exceptionally long regardless of the time of day in which you frequent the restaurant & if you order a pizza or not...Because let's be realistic pizzas take approximately 30 min: 10 minutes prep time and 20 minutes to bake. *Tiramisu far surpassed Olive Garden's but the Salted Caramel Pudding is to die for!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem?start=20
