Anna P.,"Boca Raton, FL",33,53,142,4.0,11/28/2017,"So many options where to begin...as always deciding on where to eat has always been a time factor..we wants something light but also scrumptious. We came here for lunch and it wasn't too bad. Although it may look crowded due to the seating placement we were able to get a booth right away. The service was quick, we got our orders in, drinks and complimentary bread was on the table.  The cousin ordered a Caesar salad with half a sandwich which was featured as a lunch combo ( wonderful idea for the indecisive minds) I ordered the house salad with a personal mushroom and sausage pizza...yes I was one of those that picked the picture on the menu bc it looked tasty. It was a good portion size for the price. I didn't care much for the salad but the dressing (Italian) was on point. I can drizzle that over anything. Pizza definitely hit the spot, wasn't too greasy with just the right amount of seasoning.  I pass by this place all the time without thinking to go in, whenever I'm in the mall I always think about the quick places to grab a bite in the food court never actually sitting down for a meal. I will definitely be back for a slice of pie or drinks with friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-beach-gardens
SL B.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",0,7,24,5.0,10/20/2017,"For this price point, I give this CPK location five stars. My family and I have been visiting the Gardens Mall CPK for 20 years. I used to work in the mall for years and ate their 2-3 times per week.  The staff is always friendly and engaging, and willing to make any changes to their dishes for their customers. Some staff members have been their for years and feel like an old friends.  The food is consistently good. In 20 years, I've never had a bad dish. Always fresh. Great curb side service.

Krishna B.,"West Palm Beach, FL",5,8,43,4.0,11/19/2017,"I ordered the five cheese fresh tomato pizza. Normally this pizza does not come with tomato sauce but we all know pizza without tomato sauce is merely cheesy bread. So we requested it be made with tomato sauce for a $1 extra. I wasn't expecting anything fancy so when the pizza was finally brought out I was shocked to see how beautiful it looked. I almost shed a tear. Long story short, it tasted just as great as it looked and our server, Oscar, was top notch. The only thing that upset me was the fact they took the ravioli dish off of their menu, it was my favorite dish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-beach-gardens

Patty W.,"Lake Worth, FL",280,1063,1750,3.0,12/3/2015,"It's been years since I've been to CPK.  I've been to this location before and it's remained the same.  It's located in the food court of the Palm Beach Gardens mall and the restaurant gets quite busy quickly.  When I went the other day at the time it opened, there was several people that came in after us and more came in as time went on.   I got the pizza for my son and they cut it up into small pieces, which was great.  He was able to handle it and I didn't have to worry about him making much of a mess.  However, my food took a little longer than expected to come out.  I got the garlic cream fettuccine with multigrain penne.  The waitress pointed out that it was ridiculous how long it was taking for the meal to come out after 20 minutes passed.  After she checked on it, it quickly came out and it was delicious.  There was plenty left over to take home to have for dinner.   It is clean and there is plenty of room for strollers to be parked in the front of the restaurant.  The staff was very nice about accommodating them and keeping them out of everyone's way when they weren't in use.  If you sit on the side next to the mall, there is plenty of people watching to do.  They even have restrooms for the customers, which makes it convenient  without a wait instead of going to the ones that are located in the food court with a possible wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-beach-gardens
Liz M.,"Jupiter, FL",182,64,35,2.0,5/7/2016,"We stopped in for a quick bite after some shopping. We were seated quickly and server was prompt. It was downhill from there. Caesar arrived and it was average. Less then 5 minutes later pizza and entree arrived. Timing is everything folks. The pizza was cold by the time we started eating it and shrimp pasta entree was bland. No grated cheese offered and couldn't find server for cheese and to take salad plates. Tables are right so having dirty dishes around while trying to enjoy meal is tough. Didn't even clear all plates while cashing out. Overall it was below average. I know better - chain restaurants are usually average at best. The longer I live in Florida, the more I realize that service is a quality that is truly lacking here. Go to your local Italian restaurant, eat local and you won't have to pay for a over priced tasteless  meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-beach-gardens
Gillian C.,"West Palm Beach, FL",8,37,6,4.0,6/10/2016,"I have always liked this place over the years. It remains busy and bustling from what I saw at lunchtime on a Thursday. I went in to order takeout, and then went to a store in the mall, walked back to my car, and drove over to curbside carry out. Perfect. The Hummus app was very good, and the warm, soft pita served with it was so delicious that I'm thinking of calling them to see if they make it themselves or buy it. It's better pita than my local Greek restaurant. I also had the avocado egg rolls, which are quite good.  For pizza, I had an old favorite, the Thai chicken . It was a tad drier than I remember and had too many bean sprouts on top, but still good. That peanut taste is great. I just read a review saying the pizza dough has too much flour and it gets on your hands, but I like that about their dough. It's good food, and it's consistent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-beach-gardens

Richard A.,"Lake Worth, FL",48,16,1,5.0,8/7/2016,"Have eaten at other CPKs a few times and was never really impressed, in fact mostly disappointed. However, an immediate decision was needed for lunch at PGA and rather the food court we worked our way to CPK. Was super busy, though no wait, sat at last open table.

Brittany Z.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",4,59,22,1.0,2/28/2017,"The CPK chain has always been a staple to me. I have ordered togo service in the past at this location but never dined in the restaurant. A few months ago a marketing representative for the company brought some salads and a promotional gift card to my office. I was in the area so decided to randomly stop in and had dinner. I was very surprised by my visit. I sat at the bar area and was instantly served by Becca, who was the only employee I actually saw besides the cooks doing anything productive. She was very attentive, unlike the three employees who were flirting, texting, and reading inappropriate blogs off there telephones to other young patrons sitting at the bar. My food was delicious, but the most disturbing thing to me was the management. The manager, which I am assuming was the manager due to her clothing, was extremely unprofessional. I watched as she observed the young employees and seemed to condone unbecoming behavior. What blew my mind the most though, was the fact that I witnessed her actually play with one of the employees hair while standing in the kitchen area. I will post the photo that I took. It is absolutely disgusting to think that this behavior occurs in a restaurant. It is unsanitary and repulsive. Lastly, when I went to pay my bill, the gift card I was given had ever been activated. Now I do not mind paying my own tab, but I do have to say that I found the entire experience an incredible disappointment. I will not be returning or ordering from this particular location in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-beach-gardens
Cynthia H.,"Miami, FL",307,90,1288,3.0,1/7/2016,"Stopped in here at The Gardens Mall instead of eating food court food. We were seated promptly. Ordered the lunch portion of Mediterranean salad and a small mushroom and sausage pizza. To be honest I was not that impressed with the pizza. The salad was good, should have ordered the full size. The pizza i guess is just not my style. The slices/crust seemed to have a lot of flour left on them and left my hands floury and the crust was chewy. Don't know if ill try that combo again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-beach-gardens
Deb M.,"Jupiter, FL",29,21,34,2.0,1/25/2015,"Server was very quick and pleasant, but neglected to address an obvious problem with my meal. The spring rolls are made into long rolls that are then cut into several pieces. One of the long rolls was burnt on the bottom beyond being edible. I turned them all over on the plate and when the server looked at the very burnt food on my plate she didn't ask me if there was a problem. There obviously was. The ice tea was also not as good as usual, tasted like it'd been made days before.  Usually have great food here...just not today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-beach-gardens
Stefan S.,"San Diego, CA",0,13,,1.0,12/11/2015,"I'm frequenting CPK all over the US because the pasta is reliably well cooked ""al dente"", whereas other places it is usually overcooked.  Also the thin crust pizza selection is rather authentic. I have this location one star for the following reason: ordered a Pear & Gorgonzola thin crust pizza.  Waitress told me that she thinks Gorgonzola was sold out but said she would check with the kitchen.  Then she came back and told me that they could make it.   When it arrived it had no Gorgonzola whatsoever but was covered by some other regular cheese.  After eating the first slice, I called over the waiting staff and told them that I'm not willing to eat cheese pizza with pears on it.  Gorgonzola has a very distinctive flavor and I eat that item a lot. It went back to the kitchen and here is the mistake I made: I ordered the pesto penne instead.  It came, was well prepared and piping hot.  Of us for only myself and my son are from that particular dish.  Both of us came down with violent diarrhea that evening without any other discomfort The cook putt a laxative into this dish, there is no doubt in my mind!  I have a friend who is a chef, and I've heard these stories before.  The manager tags the cook and the coil takes revenge.  In short, beware of this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-beach-gardens

Lolly A.,"Kearny, NJ",101,24,4,4.0,1/27/2015,"I have always enjoyed CPK. They recently revamped their recipes, mostly the way they make pizza. The crust is very tasty but definitely more greasy than it used to be. You must also now ask for the bread that used to be complementary.  This location is always packed on weekends. You can use the app to pre order your food and pick it up for take out. The staff is cheery but often appear to be overworked/tired.  I recommend this place if you have over an hour for a meal.

Christopher M.,"Lake Worth, FL",98,157,156,3.0,2/10/2015,Never had a bad meal at the California Pizza Kitchen CPK is a great place the food is usually fresh and fast and the service is pretty good. Giving him a three star rating because of the service the currently there is a problem with the customer who didn't like their service they asked to be moved to a different section. Which affected the same the whole flow of all the staff there for some reason. Service not a fun in the street did sucks and is difficult and you have to really work for tips if you still cannot control that.

Robert C.,"North Palm Beach, FL",41,70,25,3.0,10/9/2013,"It started out a little slow, the host seemed untrained in how to seat a servers station. There were only 2 servers in the restaurant and the host was triple seating them, so our server didn't make first touch with us until 5 minutes after we sat. In a situation like this the host, who was doing nothing else really, could have taken our drink order and handed us off to the server.  Amber got our drink order, and the drink orders for the two tables closest to us. Our non-alcoholic drinks came out quickly enough and Amber took our food order after returning with our beers. We tried the new corn, avocado with chips small plate and the crunchy mac and cheese. Both were solid with our group.  My wife ordered the Spicy Chipotle chicken pizza which she enjoyed because it had really good heat. She didn't care for the lime sauce.  I chose the Garlic Chicken pizza which was flavorful..  The kids had a kids cheese pizza and a chicken caesar salad. All were good.  Right near the end of our meal a woman who I assume was the manager stopped by our table to inquire about the meal. I think this is always a nice touch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-beach-gardens?start=20
Larry G.,"San Diego, CA",17,56,,1.0,12/29/2011,"What constituted hip... in '81. When Southern California gave the impression of Olivia Newton John getting physical in the gym with Jamie Lee Curtis-era sweatband-beheaded perfect John Travolta, maybe throwing in a dash of Richard Gere's American gigolo and Woody Allen's trek west in desperate pursuit of Annie Hall. When East Coast fare was viewed as too heavy for body conscious sun-soaked LA. Wasted meal. I hate that. I'm on vacation from California. Never eat this pseudo-food at home. And I come to this? But we were at the mall. I was hungry. And I had a gift card. Still no excuse.  The white corn guacamole tasted like candy with not a trace of spice or flavor; just clumpy sweetness from the predominant corn. I thought the five chips they irritatingly fake fancy assembled ten inches away from the green mound on the board-shaped plate was skimpy. But the small pile of ""guacamole"" with no heft due to the lack of luscious avocado was finished with only the use of two chips. So three flimsy chips left that no one really wanted. The hummus tasted more like onion dip. Much like the garbage guacamole-- no bite, no taste, no nothing. Just flat. The so-called pita wasn't even fresh. Merely pieces of bland dough that resembled the real thing. We ordered the crispy mac and cheese balls for the kids. All that they really bit into was the crispy part, like a double layer of batter. There was some Kraft style low quality orange ooze lightly brushing the middle of the oily casing, but not one whole elbow macaroni in sight. Isn't the fun of a mac and cheese ball a tightly bound amalgam of soft mac and cheese and crunchy fried coating? Not here, where creating such a fine assemblage would require an ingenuity and attention to detail that corporate headquarters doesn't deem economically, aesthetically, or gastronomically necessary. Since pizza is in the restaurant's name, we ordered a salad pizza. Now, I know the deal. This is supposed to be a light healthy variation of traditional pizza. But this thing was a lettuce topped parmesan flavored cracker with not even a suggestion that it was a pizza. The giant pieces of lettuce hovered above and concealed the cracker crust. Just didn't go together. Salad pizza can work, where you finely chop the salad ingredients and spread it over a lightly sauced sturdy crust. I used to get this often in New York. But this isn't New York. It's fake California in a South Florida mall.  I love raviolis. I love raviolis so much, I don't even mind the Chef Boy Ar Dee canned variety. But the ""four cheese"" raviolis here were horrendous. First of all, they were undercooked. Not al dente undercooked. Sludgy tough undercooked. And the sauce was lacking all four of the cheeses advertised. The only dairy was cream. Cream and canned tomato paste blended to oblivion. Again tasteless. Again soulless.  The CPK franchise, like all chains (Applebee's, Chili's, Cheesecake Factory, etc.), cynically bank on the consumer's lack of taste buds and fear of the unknown. In these establishments, dull and predictable are good.  But in this crapfest, it's even worse. Under the guise of ""healthy"" (which it is absolutely not), they can cut out expensive ingredients; not just beef and and pork, but spices and a variety of interesting cheeses and vegetables. They sell their inedible trash by promoting the false idea of ""light."" This con is realized by finely chopping chicken scraps and bits of tomato. Almost every dish has these two ingredients presented in the same manner. Pizzas with very little cheese, pastas with no hint of cheese.  Light means cheap. But cheap for the corporation, not the consumer. My bill was nearly $50. $50 for complete garbage. And there was a line when we left!  I'm a tourist, but I know that, with the influx of Northerners, there are far better Italian food, and at a better price, in this area.  But we settle. And by settling, by sticking with what is sold to us, what's programmed into our brain by slick advertising, by not taking risks, living in fear of what we don't know, we are left with this. But this is not good. It never is. It's terrible. It's junk.  One day, we will wake up and realize that the corporate food trade is selling us a bogus set of goods. We'll know that it's all a facade, idiotic concepts of what ""fancy"" or ""classy"" or ""hip"" or ""family"" are. We will then en masse stop giving up our hard earned wages to these faceless purveyors of dumbed down food that kills the spirit.  These giant conglomerates that own a series of franchises treat us like slaves at the trough. The corporate-run state pay us petty wages which we squander for corporate entertainment. Well, CPK is not entertaining. It's based on a scam, preying on our fears and desires, keeping us numb and without identity.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-beach-gardens?start=20
