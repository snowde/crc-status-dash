Kara M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",272,648,3116,4.0,5/23/2016,"We visited Palm Desert for the day on Saturday after a trip to Salvation Mountain.  Palm Desert in general was pretty dead around 3pm on the particular day we visited.  We don't really know the area too well, so we ended up selecting this CPK for late lunch/early dinner. We ended up selecting a table by the bar area, it was semi outdoors.  I am not sure if this business we be considered pet friendly, so I would call ahead to check first. The food was the usual CPK food.  I opted for a pizza and my husband selected a pasta dish.  Food quality was good, though I think my Five Cheese Pizza was perhaps missing a few of the cheeses.  We split the Butter Cake for desert, which is amazing!  Our server was pretty good about checking on us and providing refills. Overall a decent experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-desert?start=20

Karalexis A.,"Palm Desert, CA",62,17,4,4.0,8/11/2016,"My dad and I usually get the Asian chicken salad + avocado egg rolls. We decided to try something new I ordered the roasted veggie salad and was worried about the Dijon vinaigrette but was delicious with the great mix of colorful veggies including artichoke hearts, bell peppers, and eggplant. My dad got the bbq chicken salad and was particularly disappointed initially with the flavor but added some ranch and all was good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-desert?start=20
Maureen S.,"London, Canada",0,43,65,4.0,5/12/2017,This location was within walking distance from the condo we had rented for 5 months this year. We had heard good things about it but had never gone. We probably would go for lunch next time as it was really busy but the food was very good. My husband had the Carne Asada pizza and I had the veggie pizza. Both were amazing. We took a lot of it home for late night snacks but had to try the salted caramel pudding~~~ sinfully good !!!!

Traycee W.,"Palm Desert, CA",52,35,9,1.0,3/3/2017,"Just had dinner at CPK, and the food is just aweful! Super salty but tasteless! Only went here because I had a gift card. Ordered a red zinfandel wine and it was sweet. Said 7:99 on menu but charged me 8 99 on the check. My guy had chicken picatta and it was salty and tasted nothing like chicken picatta! Menu said 15.99 and we goylt charged 16:99.  I had pesto and could not hardly eat it. Salad was bland and boring! Do yourself a favor and eat some where else!

Eurycria A.,"Manila, Philippines",64,41,60,3.0,11/18/2016,I love California Pizza Kitchen and for the first time ever I was actually craving it so my boyfriend and I went to the El Paseo Gardens to go to our favorite restaurant! Our food came in nice and warm and they were delicious but I felt like we are so high maintenance on our drink that our server kept forgetting to refill my water and my bf's soda and he wanted to get his money's worth on that. Overall service was okay I guess she was training but I just hoped I was assisted by another server name Ashley. She was right next to the station of our other server and she was very attentive to all her tables and I wish we had her as our server. Maybe next time we'll request her!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-desert?start=20
Megan L.,"Palm Springs, CA",0,1,,5.0,9/28/2017,"Ive never written a review befor but i feel compelled to because of such consistant food and great service . Ive always loved the food at CPK but i must say i really go to this location because of the service and experience i get here. Theres some amazingly hard working individuals that make me return time and time again. Betty is so great if you want alot of interaction, shes always smiling and you really want to get to know her. Ashley gives amazing speedy service..again another smiling face. Karissa is such a rock star in the bar. Derek could be running the place and makes a killer drink. By the way the specialty drinks here are so interesting and fresh. Always something new to try. Taylor was a manager when i went in and man does that girl have spunk, so passionate about her career .i ordered curb side due to my 18 month old being in the car with me and nicole had it out to me in less than 5 min. I mean really.. This place is full of amazing individuals that bring soo much to the hospitality industry and ill keep coming back for more.

Audra A.,"Monrovia, CA",22,40,2,4.0,8/19/2016,We typically get takeout from here so I can't really speak to dining in.  If you've ever eaten at a CPK you know what to expect.  It's a chain so the overall quality is standard at all the locations I've been to.  Typical order is 3-4 pizzas and a salad and as usual the food was delicious. I just wish their pizza offerings hadn't been so downsized over the years.  So many wonderful pizza's that I used to order are gone now.  If they touch my Jamaican jerk chicken (which fortunately you can still get on regular crust if you ask) I may have to bid them farewell.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-desert?start=20

Jeremy L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,2,1,1.0,9/10/2016,"We're not from around this location. We got here on a Sat and looked reasonably open. We were sat immediately, and bread was brought timely.  Michelle was our waitress, and took her time getting to us. We ordered water to drink since it was hot outside, and it took a long time to get it. 3 other tables were seated after us, and their drinks were delivered before ours.  We finally ordered. Cedar plank salmon, Mahi mahi tacos and a kids pepperoni pizza.  Again the three tables sat after us were brought their food before ours. Once we got it, the salmon was overcooked and the mahi mahi tacos were had little mahi in them.

My wife and I sat down at the bar the other night and Marsella asked if I wanted to same bottle of Zin that I ordered 3 weeks prior.  Who does this?!?! Marsella , Jen, Ashley....

Allan M.,"La Jolla, La Jolla, CA",0,9,,2.0,9/16/2016,"No Soup for You!  Sloooow. Acting on impulse while out shopping, I phoned in a takeout order for a couple of serving of my favorite Tortilla Soup. A very pleasant young woman told me it would be some 18 minutes before it would be ready. No problem - being around the corner, I would run an errand first. I showed up 20 minutes after the order. No soup. 25 minutes... still no soup. 35 minutes after the order, it was filled. Explanation: it takes 30 minutes to warm up the soup. Careful, my friends.

Alam F.,"La Puente, CA",12,64,90,5.0,8/28/2015,"Out of town, came to CPK because I love pizza and I know I would have a great time anywhere I go visit family and there's a CPK near the area. So we made plans to have dinner at this CPK in El Paseo, we were greeted nicely and offered my family a table within 5 min. Our server immediately brought us bread and butter and was patient with us because we were still waiting on one more family member. Considering that a bigger group came in after us, when the last family member arrived I was impressed how fast our food came to us from the time she took our order to the time she brought the other table their drinks. We never felt pushed to finish, she even offered us dessert which we did. I ordered my usual Pepperoni Pizza, A combination of rustic and spicy pepperoni with fresh Mozzarella and wild oregano. + White Truffle Oil For dessert I had the Chocolate Soufflé, hot chocolate cake topped with ice cream on the top, a delicious combination in your mouth of hot and cold.  Last but not least the quality of the food, the taste of the meals and the price, all were right on point, happy to say so far that CPK has not disappointed me at anytime or at any location whether it is in my hometown or out of town I can always count on them. A++++ (5 Stars to them)  Great Job!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-desert?start=20

Deb R.,"Palm Desert, CA",0,38,4,5.0,2/10/2017,"We came here for lunch after admittedly the daily grill had too long a wait. We were greeted cheerfully and seated promptly. The highlight was our waitress whose name I regret I can't remember. The food was pretty good too. There were 4 of us and we shared various salads and flatbreads. Very tasty and well priced. Nice ambiance at least for lunch. It's nice to go to a restaurant with not only quality food but appreciative staff who didn't rush us, even at the busy lunch hour.

Gayaneh A.,"Glendale, CA",232,161,194,2.0,7/12/2016,"Oh boy! this place was a disaster. We went with 6 kids and three adults. The kids were doing really well but with the place empty (we missed the lunch rush) why no one would help us beyond me. Well, finally we ordered and all our orders were messed up (the 3 adults). We decided to take it anyway but they insisted on bringing the right plates. Then we get the check and they've comped our wrong orders? Well obviously I wasn't going to pay for that! It was all a mess but really, when your place is empty and there is such a big group with kids, why lag? Not happy with the service here at all. It's just that it's Palm Desert and there aren't much choices for semi-kid friendly places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-desert?start=60
Sandy K.,"Whittier, CA",3002,1575,9407,4.0,1/17/2013,I was out on a job walk with two clients at the Big Horn Country club and after we finished I suggested lunch at CPK. This CPK is located on swanky El Paseo drive and we parked across the street. Once we arrived we were seated within minutes. Our waitress was friendly and took our drink orders asap. I went with the fish tacos and added slices of  creamy avocado and chips and salsa were served with the two tacos. My tacos were large and definitely were filling and went great with my strawberry lemonade. My clients hadn't been too CPK in years and they were both satisfied with their entrees also.

She is not efficient at all nor can she handle too much at one time. She becomes very frazzled and than forgets half of the orders. I had to remind her what I had and than she still forgot. The gentleman who was waiting for his order as well was very frustrated with her.

Took almost 25 min just to get bread brought to our table. Finally, dinner arrived and all was going well until a black hair was found in one of our pasta dishes. That sealed the deal on a horrible experience. It's a shame as we have eaten there before with no problems.

Because they are constructing one 200 yards from my office (where El Cholo recently closed), I decided we would try this one out while here in Palm Desert. Unfortunately, it reminded me of why I avoided CPK for almost 30 years.  The four of us each ordered the lunch pizza with soup or salad. My pepperoni and sausage pizza had almost nothing on it. One of the 4 slices had no pepperoni on it, and there were 5 pieces of sausage on the whole pizza. The pepperoni was paper thin and chewed like cardboard. Cheese was minimal. The Caesar salad was very mediocre - something I would expect to get at Taco Bell (where I don't eat). And they gave the tiniest little container of dressing that was 1/4th what it should have been.

The Palm Desert location has always been the best.  Great pizzas, flavorful doughs snd sauces, unique selections/creations (Sicilian is my favorite, minus the sausage; it's thin crust, so good!), great menu, salads are yummy, offers food to go, can pre-order on Internet.. and a nice selection of appetizers. We've been coming to the PD location since they opened  Always consistent and reliable. Giving 4 stars only because sometime during 2013-2014, they remodeled, modified the menu, made a huge bar area.. compromising what ambience it did have.

Renee G.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",0,11,,5.0,7/30/2017,I am a regular patron at CPK.  I just dined there today.  The food is always excellent.  I do want to give a shout out to Derrick.  He is always awesome!  Betty is awesome as well!  It is always nice to walk in and they both welcome me with a smile.  I always get excellent service from both of Derrick and Betty.  They both have great attitudes and it is always nice to chat with them!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-desert?start=40
Hayley S.,"Palm Desert, CA",119,12,1,1.0,2/24/2016,"I'm changing my review from 3 stars to 1 star. I went to dinner there on Friday, February 19, with 2 family members. We sat at the bar and it took the bartender (who had super long hair, which wasn't pulled back and kept getting in her way) about 10 minutes to get more menus. She barely asked us if we wanted drinks. She didn't just naturally give us water, we had to ask. She rudely asked for my ID, I told her I wasn't drinking, she gave me a nasty look and said ""I still have to check."" I understand you have to check, but there's a nicer way to handle things. When food came, they didn't give us silverware, so we asked for some. A blonde girl slammed silverware down in front of us and didn't even hand it out to each of us individually. It seemed that the bartenders there were more concerned about making drinks for the entire restaurant than helping the people around them. We saw other people ask for water, the bill, more drinks, but the bartenders would ignore their request and just focus on the task they were working on at that moment. I will not be coming back to this CPK. There are way better restaurants on El Paseo with way better customer service. It's a shame the nice bar area is going to waste at this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-desert?start=40
G D.,"Palm Desert, CA",0,42,2,3.0,12/17/2016,My husband and I walk in on Sunday at 2 pm and chose to sit at the bar. The waitress flies by and throws the menus on our table. She comes back. takes our drink and food order. She comes back with 2 lemonades 2 totally wet straws. Returns again and throws bread plate on table so roughly bread falls off plate on table. The 2 bread plates are dirty. i got clean straws from the bar. she replaced bread and breadplates. The actual food was good but what kind of service is this?

Duncan M.,"Palm Desert, CA",6,189,174,3.0,10/6/2016,Love CPK. Came today and it was a little busy. Told wait time was 20 mins but it was shorter   Had a friendly server but she wasn't quite up to par. Saw a man in a grey chef's shirt and he was checking his phone. He then shredded Parmesan into a little bowl and touched the cheese with his fingers.  I didn't see him wash after touching is phone.  My dish wasn't how it is usually made and the general manager came by to let me know they were remaking it. The manager also offered to take the cost of the pasta off the check which I appreciated but declined to the dismay of my wife. The remade dish was delicious. And I didn't want to take advantage.

Romy K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",43,64,56,1.0,1/2/2016,"Not a huge fan of CPK in general, but overall I would rate them a 3 star restaraunt. Why the 1 star you ask? Well, we were vacationing with the family on New Year's Eve and wanted to go out for dinner. We tried calling Cheesecake Factory, Olive Garden, Islands, etc, and they were all either closed or had an hour+ wait. I called CPK, and to our delight, I was told by the woman on the phone that ""no, we do not have any wait, and we'll be open our regular hours, we close at 10 pm."" It was 905 at this time. So all 15 of us got in our cars, loaded up all the kids, car seats, strollers, etc and went to CPK.  When we got to the front door, the doors were locked. There was only one party in the dining area, and the rest were all employees just staring at us. No one came to the door or even motioned to us. So I called the number again and it was the same lady that answered the phone. She said ""oh yeah, my GM called me right after you called and told me that we are going to close at 930."" I told her that that really sucks because we drove all the way out here with 4 cars and the kids are tired and starving, and she said ""oh come in and I'll give you free food vouchers."" I told her I wasn't interested and hung up. That was the worst customer service experience I have ever had. She tried justifying it that her GM didn't even let them know earlier and that it was just her second day back to work. She wasn't apologetic and didn't really care how that affected me and my family. She was just going on and on about how her GM didn't even give them a heads up. We ended up going to Red Lobster down the road and had a pleasant time. Mark my word, I will never visit any CPK...EVER!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-desert?start=40

Taylor D.,"Boise, ID",425,131,37,2.0,10/12/2015,"Cpk has a nice location at a corner on El Paseo.  After going to most of the restaurants that specialize in pizza in the Valley, this place doesn't have the quality or value that makes this place worth repeat business.  Their gluten-free crust is probably the first example I've ever come to realize what eating cardboard really means. Every pizza costs around $17-20 and is only a personal size pizza.. (10"" inches) You can get the exact same pizza out of the freezer at a store for $6 and realize why it's only $6. I don't think you get the quality for value here. It's all very cliche basic food that isn't anything great.  CPK is basically like a nicer Applebee's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-desert?start=40
Nichole H.,"San Marcos, CA",0,11,,1.0,7/7/2016,"Really crappy service from ALL workers. My boyfriend and I are visiting from San Diego and had ISRAEL as our server. We haven't been in years and we went over the menu and figured out what we wanted and sat for a good 15 minutes before Israel ever came over to greet us or to take our drink orders. We literally were starring down servers to figure out who was ours and the menus were put away. We looked ready to order... The worst part- the place was empty. He took our order and brought us bread, and then we didn't see him for a while. He didn't even bring out our food. Our drinks sat empty for a long time and it took about 5-10 more minutes after he asked if he wanted refills to actually bring the refills. There were about 10 workers and they cared more about having fun and joking with each other. They were standing around, joking, and counting their tips in front of all of us.  One customer had a baby and was upset that her food was taking too long and tried to leave and no one even care for her. It was sad to watch. The food didn't even taste that good. The soda was the best part... I'm just extremely bummed about the service. The place was dead and there was no reason for bad service.

I ordered the BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad with sliced avocado, and the mister devoured his Pepperoni, Sausage and Mushroom pizza.

Haley E.,"Bellingham, WA",10,58,12,5.0,12/20/2017,"This place has got it all right. As you walk in, the decor catches your eye and it is noticeably clean inside. Pleasant waitstaff greet and seat you. Your drink order is taken and complementary bread is brought over with oil to dip.  Once food is ordered, it is brought out quickly and is so delicious. We particularly love the salads- the BBQ chicken and the Italian Chop to be specific. My mom and her husband frequent this restaurant and the pizzas and dinner entrees are also loved by them. I had a Moscow Mule- my favorite alcoholic drink- and it was pure perfection! It had a lime wedge and shaved ginger in it- what a fresh and flavorful twist. I highly recommend it. To top it off, the waitstaff is incredibly kind, patient and detail oriented.

Raychelle S.,"La Quinta, CA",191,74,114,3.0,8/28/2017,"Exactly what my star rating means. A- OK. Here are the pros and cons of my dining experience at California Pizza Kitchen. The location and convenience. It is located on El Paseo towards the west end. This leaves for prime parking and walking to other shops around El Paseo if you want to walk off that pizza you just ate (Just saying because that is exactly what my mom and I did). Its easy to find and its surrounded by great shopping.  Inside. It is nice and welcoming inside. I also have to mention that the lighting is pretty decent. Just putting that in there if you wanted to capture the moment. It was clean and inviting. The bar area is secluded and away from the rest of the ""normal"" dining area. Note- for happy hour you have to be sitting in the bar area. Our waiter also mentioned that the happy hour is not out of this world. So pass.  Our service. Our waiter was accommodating, especially because we had a hungry baby sitting with us. She waited on our every request and was very nice. Also gave us great recommendations. The waiting time for our appetizers wasnt too bad. The waiting for the rest of our other food was longer than we anticipated. I get it though because it was a packed house...  The food. It was a okay. The appetizers we had were the spring rolls or something of the sort and they were pretty good. Though i dont know why people rave about the thai chicken pizza so much. We got that and I didnt like it very much. It wasnt what I was hoping for and I'd wish we tried something else. The ceseaer salad was okay but I dont expect it to be something out of this world. Everything was just ok. I'd go back if I had to but not for choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-desert

Joe R.,"Reno, NV",25,102,287,4.0,2/11/2016,"CPK is a hip and groovy place to chow down, some real interesting bites! I can't but help to continually ordering the Chicken Tequila Fehttuchini because it is just so different and extremely flavorful and even has a bit of a kick. Definitely a dish you will find no other place on earth, I am quite certain of this. Ron had the California Cobb Salad served on a platter, wow that was some portion!  Our waiter Israel was super pleasant and really on the ball with our table. He pays attention to the details which I can say so very few servers now a day really do not comprehend or have never been served by someone who does!  I ordered the Petite Wedge Salad which also was very good, but in my opinion what dinged CPK from a perfect experience and meal was the the food runner brought our main dish out before I could even take two bites out of my wedge! One thing that really irks me is running courses prematurely or running them too slow. Pay attention to the pace in which your patrons are eating, this will give you a clue when it is the right time to bring the next course or suggest dessert. This was not Israel's fault but the speed at which the kitchen and runners are working in team.  One word of advice I have is to be careful if you charge your meal; pay careful attention to your  bill for on it is a line right above the tip line to offer a donation to RoundUp4Charity. Now I have no problem with any establishment soliciting donations from their guests to support charities, but we did not see one blurb in either the menu on the table or mentioned by our server or hostess about it.

Michele S.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,6,7,1.0,6/18/2017,"Tonight felt like a scene from a horror movie. We chose CPK like a safety blanket as our 3-hour commute then shopping extravaganza left us starving for some comfort food. Upon arriving we needed to remind the hostess that we were in fact a party of 3 adults and 2 children. She managed to forget and yet ask us any possible combination before showing us to the table (2 adults, 3 kids, etc). After getting the children settled we realized it was at least 15 minutes before being greeted by the wait staff. Since we had plenty of time, when our waitress showed up we were ready to place our order. Two kids cheese pizza, salad and two pasta dishes. Not customization or allergy request - should have been easy ask for the chefs. Two bread deliveries and 40 minutes later the waitress informed us the kitchen lost the order. Please remember I noted we had 2 children. They were becoming tired and hungry.  Stunned and hungry we then provided the order to the waitress for the SECOND time hoping the evening would be improved. The manager apologized, brought over some avocado egg rolls and promised a 10 minute meal delivery. Clock was officially at 1 hour 5 minutes.  Thirty five minutes later we were storming out of the restaurant after the waitress returned the THIRD time asking us what we ordered. It is completely unacceptable for the wait staff AND management to treat its customers this way when the issue could have easily been mitigated.  The easiest solution to preventing our misfortune was to simply deliver the food we asked for. The management took no responsibility to follow up to ensure the meal was delivered in tact. Delivering an appetizer and assuming the service has been recovered is not acceptable. The fact that we were so close to the kitchen means that there is little excuse for why the staff could not ensure we received our meal.  Two hours later and a dozen excuses more, we left with some food in hand after demanding it be made 'to-go' after scolding the manager and waitress. Words cannot express how furious and disappointed we are.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-desert

Too much emphasis on ""going above and beyond""? Just plain scripting to the point of coming across as a bad Disney movie?  Who knows, and maybe that's what the clientele there expects (to be ass-kissed to the point of feeling like the emperor with new clothes), but to a visitor from the middle class suburbs who keeps it real and isn't very tolerant of BS or brown nosing, it felt like being fed an overly sweet cake with too much Splenda and a jelly filling made with fairy poops.  Tone it down guys, and just keep it real.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-desert?start=140

I hate to bullet-point the place, but it really doesn't deserve my prose. * The booths for two (which we were seated in) are too small, especially if both people order a pizza. * This was the loudest restaurant I've been to in the Coachella Valley. It must have something to do with the acoustics of the place, because they weren't packed or anything, but I felt like our table was on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. * My wife's ""Spaghetini"" (if that's how it's spelled) was bland. I'm not sure why there was a ""tini"" on the end. It didn't come with a martinin, or anything. * The waiter warned me that my Habañero Cilantro pizza was really spicy, but that the really hot stuff comes on the side. Once our food came, I had to ask him to bring the sauce, as he had forgotten. The flavor of the pizza was passable, at best. * Did I mention that it was LOUD? * When we were done eating, we asked for 1) a glass of water, 2) a box for leftovers, 3) an accounting of a gift card (which had ~$7-$8 left on it), and 4) the check. What we received: 1) a box for leftovers, 2) a report that the gift card had a zero balance, along with an explanation that perhaps it had expired (huh? isn't that against the law?), and 3) someone else's check, sitting several tables away. We didn't expect the waiter to remember the water, so we weren't disappointed. * At the booth next to us, their avocado egg role appetizer was delivered as they were about half-way through their meal, along with an apology that they had ""run out.""

Then the person who took my initial phone order did not take it down in exact detail, I was missing items, and my pizza was not made how I specified. I should have checked the food out in the car. I drove right home after I finally got it the pizza was cold and dry. The crust was hard & actually was painful to chew. Really a disappointment.

I haven't visited in over 10 years, but I don't ever remember loving it as much I as I did on my visit last Saturday. We went in for lunch and were pleasantly greeted by the staff and were well taken care of by our server, Sierra. She was fantastic!  We sat at a window table and shared the Creamy Pesto Penne w/ Sundried Tomatoes, and the 5-Cheese and Tomato Pizza. Both went beyond our expectations. The penne was creamy and flavorful and the sundried tomatoes were a wonderful compliment to the pesto. The pizza crust was done perfectly and the creaminess of the cheeses caused for a very satisfied diner.  The only complaint I could possibly give was that the restaurant was freezing cold, and it's impossible to sit anywhere that doesn't have an A/C vent above you.

All the staff eating and maybe 1-2 employee's actually working!  Most of the times we come there are only max 3 tables eating and one of them being employees. You would think they have time to serve you but they are never around to ask for things and get refills! No urgency... It feels like ALL the servers are new untrained young kids serving for the first time.  I love the menu and keep coming back for torture. My family eats out at ALL the restaurants at least 4 times a week here in Coachella Valley. We visit CPK at least once every 2 weeks but this time I waited almost a month and when we arrived today..... Some guy that I never met before said "" welcome back"" then the waitress who I have never met before said "" you are regulars!l Seems to me they have talked about my family and were prepared to screw us again! My first impression of the waitress was that she had it together!! And was beating me to my Questions.. Obviously she was schooled!!  We asked for bread since it wasn't offered and it has never been since they changed their policy at CPK. She returned with drinks and then said "" oh they are making a new batch of bread and it will be awhile."" We waited and waited and saw another waiter take bread to another table and then we waited and waited and finally grabbed another waiter and asked him.... He helped us and no waitress around for at least another 10min. Then our main course came out by a food runner and no waitress to get cheese, refills on drinks or extra sauce! No one around again then we saw the same waiter that helped us just minutes ago and asked him!!! He delivered everything we asked again!!  So at the end of another horrific visit, I went ahead and gave our assigned waitress a smaller tip and the remaining 20% to the other server who was attentive and more of a service than our own assigned waitress.  After many bad experiences here... I will NOT return and hope that a secret shopper will come though, a executive at corporate or someone that can make a change here.

A few nights it took awhile to get our entrées but the appetizers and drinks came out quick every single time. There was an occasion where we sat at the bar section and when we asked our server about a drink on the menu.. she gave her opinion and recommended to substitute something for another. We did. And it was an extra $7 charge! We weren't aware it would cost extra let alone a whole other drink. We each got this drink and it cost us between $27-32 for both. A bit ridiculous. I confronted her when we got the check and she said ""Well the substitute is a whole other alcohol so it's like ordering another drink but just mixed into one."" My reaction, ""Had we known this was the case, we would've just got the original and not your recommendation and then got the other drink as our second. So at least we are enjoying 2 drinks instead of one $16+ drink."" She didn't budge and I asked to talk to the manager. He sided with the server and we still paid. Our issue was with not being told that her recommendatuon would cost more than 2 drinks for just 1.  I still gave it 4 stars instead of less since I haven't seen both the manager lately.

Adrienne T.,"Palm Desert, CA",33,100,3,4.0,12/13/2010,"It was just before 4:00 p.m.and I decided we could no longer go without eating. Because it was off primetime for restaurant attendance it occurred to me that it would be an opportune hour for California Pizza Kitchen.  We seldom go, the reason being it is usually crowded and there is more often a wait than not.  I don't do waits.  Another reason we rarely patronize CPK is the service is slow. Requested a table by the window, not for the view, as it looks out on the driveway into the parking lot, but because it is light and bright.  Server, Tamara took our order pretty quickly and brought drinks and bread.  We waited a little longer than I would have expected for the food to arrive, but it wasn't too objectionable. My husband had pan sauteed salmon with pasta containing asparagus.  I thought the salmon looked overcooked, however, he said not a word against it.  I had my old standby, an original chopped salad.  Actually, I thought it was less tasty than all the others I had, but it was acceptable.  Due to the fact we had been so hungry, I asked for a meat lovers pizza for good measure.  I knew we wouldn't be able to eat that much, but pizza travels well to take home. I find it ironic that the chain calls itself ""California PIZZA Kitchen"".  I think pizza is their least desirable food item.  Not that I pretend to be an expert.  We don't eat pizza even twice during the year.  CPK's product seems to me to be so un-Italian.  It's pretty bland and I've never tasted a hint of any Italian seasonings in the few that I have sampled.  It is edible though and we had almost the entire pie to box up. The service was fine as were the surroundings.  We departed the restaurant stuffed, carrying our leftover pizza and the remains of my salad.  It was all pretty enjoyable despite my possibly unreasonable fault finding.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-desert?start=160

Jeff R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",175,32,18,4.0,11/26/2013,We called ahead to see how long the wait was and we were told 25 min. The host was able to take our name down as we drove to the restaurant and when we arrived only waited maybe 5min. The restaurant is currently under construction and parking is tough. After being seated our server Doug greeted us pretty quickly and took our drink order.  He was pretty nice and did a great job overall. After our drinks came we ordered and our food came out quick.  Food tasted great and Doug was good with getting us refills. All things considered it was a great experience. The negatives were the parking due to construction and some of the appetizer plates were dirty.

He explained that they had changed their decor a little, and along with that went the special nametags.  Shortly after he took our drink orders, the manager (whose name I did not catch but who was delightful!) came over with a plate of pizza pieces that she explained were a new three cheese pizza they were featuring.  She joked with me about not having been to CPK in a long time, and it was a nice gesture for sure.  Our food was OUTstanding!  One friend had their Waldorf salad which was just the most incredible salad I've ever tasted - I ended up eating at least half of it for her.  The dressing was just impeccable and nicely complemented my Thai Chicken pizza on whole wheat crust (which was just as good as I remember!).  My other friend had one of their pasta dishes with shrimp and we had no conversation from her AT ALL during dinner because she was so into her food.  She said it was one of the best dishes she had ever had and that she was glad I had made us drive 10 miles from Palm Springs to get here.

One HUGE problem, the customer service experience was horrid! After placing my order online, I realized I forgot to omit mayo on a sandwhich. When I called the phone number, they place me on hold for 3 minutes, then another person pick up the phone and would get the right person for me, I waited another 5 mintues, then it happened AGAIN! Needless to say, after waiting on hold for 13 minutes to speak to someone, I was pissed. I only wanted to make sure that they did not add any Mayo to the exisiting order I had placed. The lady before I spoke to the manager was a bit rude and apologized for them being busy and their golf cart delivery issues. I did not care. It was unprofessional and they need to be trained better to handle customer service issues like this. When my associate went to go pick up our order, guess what, there was MAYO on the sandwich!!  What a bunch of buffoons. I will never eat here again. If you do enjoy CPK, just be cautious when doing take out because they seem to be very disorganized and do not communicate with the kitchen.
