Stacy A.,"Mountain View, CA",5,283,,4.0,11/5/2017,"I've been to this restaurant a few times, the pizza's are good. I like the small size perfect for one hungry person or to share if you are not so hungry. Today I wanted to try something different so I ordered the fish taco's. Although the portion was very generous (3 big taco's) with a side of chips and salsa, the fish was not fresh and tasted way too fishy. The taco's had a fantastic sauce and were tasty otherwise. The chips were cold and bland, but the salsa was very good. I would not order this again. I think next time I will stick to the pizza's, which are their specialty and taste really good.  Other than that, the service was good, and the wait was way shorter than the hostess had predicted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palo-alto-3
Cain D.,"San Diego, CA",274,1,,1.0,11/19/2017,"If I could give 0 stars for this place I would. I'm not sure what kind of place they are running here!  Worst place to have a family dinner at! Our order consisted of 2 pizzas,salmon plate, garlic Alfredo, and tequila lime chicken. We had to constantly ask them about my tequila lime chicken because everyone was finishing up their food. My tequila lime chicken never came so we told the waitress to cancel the order because everyone had finished their food. Approximately 2-3 minutes later the manager came out to bring my food even though I had witnessed the waitress telling her manager that our table had cancelled. The manager offered to not charge for my plate and asked if I still wanted it. I accepted her offer and told her to put it in a take out container because I wasn't about to make my dinner guests sit there and wait until I finish eating. By the time we were done paying the packed up pasta never came. I had to ask about it again!  The finale is that when I go home hours later into the night I open up the container just to find less than a half sized order of pasta. I have no idea what happened to the other half. Did the manager or waitress take it home to eat because cpk doesn't pay for their meals.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palo-alto-3
Brandon Y.,"San Jose, CA",827,615,1134,4.0,8/30/2017,"I've only been to CPK twice, and this was my second - I was actually quite impressed. The reason for going was that they're doing a Philanthropizza fundraiser for an organization I am a part of, donating 20% of the bill, which is awesome! Arrived with the family and I ordered the Roasted artichoke and spinach pizza and split a half order of BBQ chicken salad with my brother. The BBQ chicken salad was better than expected. The chicken was still warm, and the BBQ sauce was nice and tangy. The roasted artichoke and spinach pizza came on a thin crust so it was a little flimsy with chunky artichokes on top - still delicious and hearty though. With the half salad and pizza, I took home leftovers. Would be down to go again to try some of their other unique pizzas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palo-alto-3
Joshua B.,"Morro Bay, CA",8,66,149,2.0,12/17/2017,"Good food small location compared to others I've been to but got seated right away on the patio. Service was decent but seemed to take awhile to get our items. She had the chicken club sandwich and I had my usual Kung Pao Spaghetti. I ordered their ""new"" ultimate Bloody Mary which was supposed to be topped with olives, pepperoni, mozzarella and herbs and all it did was come with a lime. Told they didn't have the normal ingredients. I think those are ingredients that go on their pizzas but yet not on their Bloody Mary. And watered down. Came here because of convenient location to the shopping we did at the mall but won't come to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palo-alto-3

Jess C.,"San Francisco, CA",1194,2459,4437,2.0,6/9/2017,"They don't have tiramisu and that was one of my favorite things about CPK! :*( * California pizza club - 3.5 stars: This was probably one of my favorite things - I liked the flavor and the soft crust. I would order it again but not come here just for that.  * Lettuce wraps - 3 stars: I prefer the ones at PF Changs across the street. It's quite a decent portion and nothing special.  * Mac n Cheese Fritters - 3 stars: I mean, how can you go wrong with this? I wasn't a huge fan but it tastes exactly like you would expect. * Chinese Chicken Salad - 2.5 stars: Pretty standard, not sure what the hype is about this.

Roxanna B.,"Centennial, Redwood City, CA",19,5,3,4.0,1/5/2018,"If you haven't been to the California Pizza Kitchen then I recommend you doing so especially for their 7-inch lunch size pizza. The original BBQ chicken pizza and the California Veggie are the best (at least they are my favorite ones). I have had pizza at other places but this pizza kitchen does it right, probably too good for a chain restaurant. They put enough of everything on it that makes it outrageously good. I always enjoy my time at the California Pizza Kitchen and it's my new best spot to be. I can see it being for a long time to come!

Ivanna O.,"Palo Alto, CA",24,9,3,5.0,12/23/2017,We came here during rush hour on a Saturday so I wasn't surprised to see it really busy. We were told it was gonna be a 25 minute wait but we were hungry so we sat down. It wasn't even 10 minutes before they sat us at our table and gave us time to go over the menu. The waiting for one item was a bit much but the food was worth it. Our server Lexi was so patient and really attentive. We ordered the Sicilian pizza and shared it between us both and it was really good. Would definitely come back. :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palo-alto-3
Tiffany D.,"Fremont, CA",545,555,6102,4.0,10/24/2016,"California Pizza Kitchen aka CPK has been a favorite of mine since high school!! I particularly enjoy this location because it is at the Stanford Shopping Center, it's very close to my job, the customer service here is amazing and the food is always on point. This locations seems to always be crowded and busy no matter what time or what day, the patio dining area seems to be extremely popular with people on nice days and it is more ideal dining on the patio than inside since the interior can get a little crammed and hectic. While they are known for their pizza with the BBQ Chicken Pizza being their most popular one, their menu is quite interesting and I definitely come here for other items. The pizza here is good, my favorite is the pepperoni since I'm very simple and plain when it come to pizza. Their crust is nice and crispy and chewy and has a bit of a sweetness to it and that's why I fell in love with the pizza. It's just different. I really love their spinach and artichoke dip as well, it's hands down the best I've ever had and a lot of the times I will do just to have that along with their hot bread and that can be a meal in itself. I'm a big pasta person so of course I've tried some of their pasta dishes which are very good as well, I particularly am a fan of the Garlic Cream Fettuccine  (   ). The sauce is very garlicky but not overpowering and it's one of the better pastas on the menu along with the Jambalaya Fettuccine.  The also have lunch duos which I find myself ordering more often, you can get a 7'' pizza and salad or soup and salad for no more than $10. It's just enough food and good for the price. Their salads and soups are yummy here as well, they have a new soup the Baked Potato soup and it is very creamy with nice chunks of potato topped with crisp bacon and scallions. This is my new fav soup, I'm a sucker for any type of potato soup. CPK definitely is a great restaurant and they have a lot of variety as far as their menu goes so you are not restricted to just pizza, they some good deals and great service. Oh and dessert if you don't remember anything try the butter cake and the Red Velvet Cake  (   ), both are very good. The food is worth the price and you won't be disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palo-alto-3
Christina S.,"San Jose, CA",63,340,36,4.0,5/28/2017,"Went for lunch on a Saturday; were seated pretty quickly. Our service was great and the food came fast. We all liked the wild mushroom pizza and the California club pizza (interesting concept). We also shared the buffalo cauliflower (they're amazing little bombs of flavor) and the grilled veggie salad.  The complaints were only that the A/C felt like it was on full blast, so super cold sitting inside, and the music was very loud.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palo-alto-3
Marisol D.,"San Francisco, CA",98,37,25,4.0,7/31/2017,"At first, my visit here was off to a rocky start. The waiter forgot to bring us the bread and took at least 15 minutes to bring us our drinks. But he was very nice and took care of the issue once we reminded him!  I got a lunch duo. I ordered the California Vegetarian Sandwich and the Caesar salad. They were both delicious and on point.  There is plenty of seating both outside and inside. There was no wait to be seated and the host was kind. The music inside was a bit strange and I feel that it contributed to somewhat of an odd ambience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palo-alto-3

Danny K.,"Palo Alto, CA",4,17,15,1.0,7/27/2017,"My wife and I used love the now closed CPK store on Cowper St., so after a while traveling we somehow had a yearning for, in her case, the Wild Mushroom Pizza and in mine the Sicilian. So we decided to give the store at Stanford Shopping Center a try. When we arrived they told us the wait would be 20 mins. We were happy when it was only about 10. After seating water and bread was dropped promptly. Soon after our server arrived. So far, so good. We ordered a bottle of wine, an appetizer, and two pizzas. MINUS ONE STAR: After about 15mins of enjoying bread and water we asked our server what happened our wine. She apologized and came back to the table and dumped (yes dumped) the wine and two glasses and walked off.  MINUS TWO STARS: So after a very long wait our pizzas arrived, we remarked to the servers that, well, we had not had our appetizer... They kinda shrugged... MINUS THREE STARS: Our appetizer arrives. My wife's pizza was cold so we swap her pizza for the Shrimp Lettuce Cups... We are at this point a bit disgruntled, but rolling with the punches. MINUS FOUR STARS: My wife excuses herself (to go to the bathroom -- figure out why here); the Shrimp lettuce cups have ""meat"" in them; she does not eat meat.  MINUS FIVE STARS: I call the server over and point out that the Shrimp lettuce cups have ""meat"" = ""chicken"" in them. She disbelieves me and checks with the kitchen. She comes back and assures me there is no chicken in what we have been served and my wife is mistaken. i dig around in the mixture, produce a piece of chicken meat and confirm by eating it in front of her that it is, indeed, chicken. I ask for a manager. MINUS SIX STARS: A manager comes out to deliver my wife's now warm pizza; It's the same pizza from before desiccated to point where when she picks up a slice it falls apart. MINUS SEVEN STARS: Manager shows us the underside of the pizza and argues since it is not black the pizza is not burnt. We cancel the mushroom pizza and the manager offers us free dessert. MINUS EIGHT STARS: We really don't want dessert, but I worked for years in the hospitality industry so I know it is important to allow a reasonable way of making good. We chose the salted caramel pudding. They must have taken one from the wrong side of the fridge (the ones to be chilled for tomorrow); it was a sloppy runny mess. At this point we just gave up. They comped the cancelled pizza, the lettuce cups and the dessert... So I might have given then a pass, but seriously a server arguing about the content of a dish? Lucky for my wife it's just she does not eat meat... If she had an allergy? Starting with 5 stars this is a -3 start review, but Yelp does not allow that, so one star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palo-alto-3
Boo B.,"Mountain View, CA",18,17,,2.0,12/29/2017,"This review is all about convenience.  CPK at this location is not baby friendly at all. They ask you to leave the stroller outside at the front, but they aren't responsible for it if it is stolen. We have a infant in his car seat. For that reason, there is a extra wait time.

Earl J.,"Mountain View, CA",344,17,15,1.0,7/19/2017,"Even though my experience was very sub par, I still tipped 20%. The waitress can only do so much. It's very clear that senior executives/CEO of this organization is way out of touch of how the locations...and from the look, lack of cleanliness of the place, and attitude of the staff...they probably run the organization on reports from middle management only.  1. Upon entering we were not greeted in a manner consistent with the standard, ""Hello. Welcome to California Kitchen. How many are in your party?"" It was just a ""how many?"" 2. Even during that exchange, the manner on duty jumped and said table 48 is open. I then asked if they had a full liquor license. To which they do.  3. Our waitress, God bless her heart...did the best she could. She didn't ask if I wanted a salad with my meal. She just took the order and moved on.  4. Our food was not brought together. My friend got his salad first. 15 minutes later he got his pizza. 20 minutes later I got my steak... which sat in the service area for like 5 minutes of that 20 before the waitress brought it to me. 5. The food itself not bad. But for 27 bucks for a steak... just expecting a little bit more on the flavor and zest side. 6. The cosmo was good and in a real glass. So that's a win.  7. When it was time to pay up, well we had to get folks attention. And it took us a while, as three staff members stood around and chatted about their closing duties and who did what.  There was a reason(s) why I haven't there in 10+ years.  Yet it still beats fast food... Please forgive any typos, etc... Thank You.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palo-alto-3

Kamaile C.,"San Jose, CA",0,21,,1.0,11/11/2017,"It's unfortunate that Stanford Shopping Center has such few family friendly dining options. This lack of options will find you waiting a really long time for a table.  When you finally get one you'll find out their beer tap is broken and that they are unsure of what they have in a bottle.  They'll then bring you a wheat beer when you asked for an IPA.  When that's finally figured out, you will order and your server will put everyone's order in, but not yours.  After that, you will ask for ketchup for a kid's meal and never get it.  They will then ask to comp a dessert, but it will take so long to get it you'll just want to leave and cut your losses.  All of this would be kind of funny if it wasn't happening to you.   This place was ridiculous and I will not ever patronize again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palo-alto-3
Melinda W.,"South San Francisco, CA",258,163,154,1.0,10/29/2016,"I was greeted by the door by someone I presume to be the manager - well dressed, well mannered, friendly. It was shaping up to be a great experience. Too bad it was all downhill from there. I approached the takeout counter, which was being manned by Monica. I asked her what sizes the pizzas were because I've never been there before. She gave me as exasperated look as if I had offended her and told me they have kids size, regular crust, and thin crust. I asked what size would be good for two people and she repeated the above statement. I asked if there was actually a difference in those pizza sizes and she repeated the above statement. Look, I know it's late and 20 minutes before you close, but I'm not having trouble hearing your only answer and your attitude is appalling. Not wanting to talk to her anymore, I ordered a pizza and she put in the order and walked away. At this point, I realized she never answered my original question of shat size would be good for two people, so I flag down someone and ask if one pizza would be enough for two people. The guy says yes, so I leave it at that. 20 minutes later, I get my pizza and it is TINY. Maybe enough for two children to split, but definitely NOT two full grown adults. What the hell, CPK?! I was more than willing to buy a second pizza, just be honest about your pizza sizes! When I explained this to the guy who told me one pizza would be enough to split, he just shrugged and asked if I wanted bread on the side to go. No I don't want bread to fill up on! If I wanted bread instead of pizza, I would have gone to a bakery instead. TL;DR - lack of concern for customers needs and poor attitude. Not once did I feel valued as a customer.

We had to wait about 15-20 minutes which was no big deal. The menu is pretty big, and it was so hard to choose what to get. It was a classic Pasta vs Pizza. We decided on flat bread appetizer with sage, and oh it was good! I ordered a classic margarita pizza and it was just awesome! The cheese wasn't as crispy as I normally like, but the ingredients were fresh and tasted clean and good!  Also the crust...it may be the softest and best crust I've ever had! I kept eating more!

As you can see from the picture none of these were included in the drink. Additionally there was NO fennel in the salt. When asked,  the waiter (who was clueless about the menu) checked with the bartender and came back to say that they ""ran out"" of pepperoni.

This place DOES get crowded even on a Thursday afternoon, when we arrived there was plenty of seating inside and a few more open tables outside, but by the time we left, there was plenty of people waiting.  My friend had the spaghetti with bolognese sauce. She said it was good because she was hungry, but once she was full, it wasn't anything to write home about.  I had the lunch combo ($11) - salad and 7"" mushroom, sausage & pepperoni pizza which I think if fair for an average lunch without stuffing yourself. Everything tasted fine, I do wish I could get more croutons, I got TWO. Is there complementary bread and dipping oil? It seemed like everyone around us was getting it but us! I love bread and butter.  Service was above all alright. At the end of lunch, I requested for a small box and forgot to ask for the bill. We had to ask for the bill after the box arrived.

First time I ordered the Halibut which was absolutely tasteless...and way over priced for what I got.

Anyways, I get there and the hostess was sweet but had no idea what I meant when I told her I ordered ""dine in"" from online. I then proceeded to the take out area who gave me my food all packaged up to go and told me I had ordered take out. I am very irritated because I was already unhappy with my last experience, and now I have no where to relax and enjoy my food and it's going to be poorer quality because they prepared it as to go. I just left and decided to find somewhere else outside. I opened my food, which I wish I had checked before leaving, to find exactly what I had not wanted. The cedar plank salmon looked and tasted dry, they did not give me the lime that it comes with, and did not include feta cheese on the corn succatosh...it was literally just corn and spinach, and from ordering it before when I actually had dined in, I'm pretty sure there was more to it.

She waited for us to talk when it should be her as the receptionist to initiate to the guests. She shouldn't be there for that job and having her there is already a downfall. She mumbled & couldnt be heard. she asked if we wanted inside or outside so we chose outside coz it was livelier there. Then we waited for the server to get out order for about 20 mins. Too long of a wait considering there wasnt much crowd that time. Another downfall. We ordered salad for the price of 11.99 each and when it came to us, it was OK but as we tasted it, something's missing. We were just kinda hungry so we ended up finishing it . But, the salad wasn't worth the price considering we've tried a lot of salads from diff restaurants but this was the worst and the most expensive ones considering the ones we tried in the past were fine class dining.. We the lettuce was hard to nibble, the salad was dry with uneven cut of chicken, no taste, their mango lemon drink wasnt mango taste, they just added yelllow orange to make it look like mango, basically the issue was the salad could have been worth the price .. You can even find 6.99 salad from groceries that taste much better than California Pizza's 11.99-15.99 salad which is bland hard and dry... Their overpricing menu is not worth it... They shld just stick with pizza selection if they can't meet other standards... You can also see 3 other tables with left over plates, goes to show different customers fr diff tables also left unsatisfied...We did not leave a tip.. we werent served better, food was poor , reception was a fail, unhappy customers = no tip If this salad represents the whole place, I don't know how they can still stay in business",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palo-alto-3?start=60

We stayed with a simple menu choice this time and it came out very good: a 1/2 Cobb Salad and a Pepperoni Pizza. The salad had really smokey bacon and was very good for a Cobb. The pizza turned out perfect: a real NY style pizza with a thin crust that had the perfect chew, the right amount of cheese and a peppery pepperoni. Could not have asked for a better light combo.  The crowd was pretty heavy and we chose to eat at the right end of the counter, where we had a great view of the ovens baking the pizzas and crusty bread loafs, the meals coming out and being finished for serving. What became apparent is that this is a hard working team that were actively serving all the dishes for the rest of the dining room.  We only saw one pizza cooling longer than we were comfortable with, thinking ""oh that cooled pizza's coming back"" but it was waiting for the rest of the entrees to come out before it was finally served. If that's the case, i would have specified to the wait staff that the pizza should be served immediately and not wait for the rest of the items. Overall, the service was attentive and friendly, the food we ordered (and a few that we drooled over when we saw it ready for serving) was really good and we very much enjoyed it. If the selection is simple and the pizza is all you want, this might be just the spot in a very busy mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palo-alto-3?start=60

Kristine F.,"Hayward, CA",448,568,3762,5.0,3/9/2013,"Jessica and her eyelashes will astound you. They're so perfect you'd swear they're fake!  On to the pizza!  My fave is: CA Club-- salad on a pizza basically with chicken, cheese, and applewood smoked bacon topped with lettuce tossed in mayo with a slice of fresh tomato & avocado on all 6 slices of pizza. I've also tried the wild mushroom and thin crust roasted garlic, both with chicken.  *Highly recommend the Thai Crunch salad with avocado!! I finished the whole full size in an hour! Honestly thought I was going to take the rest home for the fam to try but it was just oh so good. I'm loving the edamame, crispy wonton strips, fried rice noodle sticks, chicken, peanuts, cilantro & especially the peanut dressing!  My friend ordered the chicken tortilla soup for a second time and still likes it.  Downside: the menu got smaller and they no longer have the salmon with lemon cream sauce pasta with capers & asparagus. Sad face.  Upside: the food & customer service! Seated within 5-7 min on a Friday at 7:20pm and friendly attentive staff that genuinely seem like they're happy to see you. My to go order was handled in a timely manner too and was ready for me to take home after paying the bill!  I shall return for you, CA Club pizza & Thai Crunch salad! -UPDATE 3/2015- JC (Juan Carlos) is a fantastic waiter! My friend and I sat outside on the patio for dinner around 5pm on a weekday and were treated like royalty. He was almost too attentive, always refilling our hot water pot/mugs and lemon wedge bowl, brought over honey packets, offered bread and olive oil at the start of the meal, and is just a calm, levelheaded, and overall personable individual that made sure we were taken care of.

I ordered a caramelized peach salad which is good as long as you didn't have any type of meat involved the salad was great that's all I can say waiter was nice.  The pizza we had was really bad. Hawaiian. The cheese wasn't that great on it, and the toppings are just so so. It just wasn't a fantastic tasting pizza as I was expecting. I would figure a big chain like this would produce a quality product consistently.  And on very simple items.

This restaurant didn't impress me but it didn't disappoint either; the waiters were extremely helpful and were prompt with seating you/getting your orders/drinks/food/etc. Food was also pretty good - in my opinion, it was probably more flavorful than the other CPK in Valleyfair. I ordered something new on the menu: Chicken Tequila Fettucine. It was delicious! The pasta sauce was very creamy, and had a very delicious lime & jalepeno taste with hints of spice. I'd say the portions aren't too big or too small, a perfect size to fill you up while leaving just enough space for dessert. I'm not crazy about this restaurant or this particular location, but it's a great place to go to every once in a while if you have a party that's split on getting pizza, salad, pasta, or sandwiches.

No problems at all with the food, we ordered pasta, fish tacos, & the highly regarded bbq chicken pizza. I didn't have high expectations for a chain so if it were based solely on food this would be 3.5 stars. I don't know if our waiter had a bad day or something but he acted so sullen the whole time that it brought me down. I found it strange how he insincerely asked my sister why she looked sad; mind you we came here after spending the day at the Stanford Medical Center but she played it off. After receiving & glancing at the check, we notice that we were charged extra for two entrees, two drinks, and a glass of wine that we did not order! Apparently this happened to my sister at this CPK before but she didn't catch it until she left that time. We flag down our waiter to bring up the gross overcharge and he has the NERVE to roll his eyes and say ""You want me to fix that?""  It seemed as if he intentionally overcharged us and became angry after we noticed cuz if an honest mistake occurred, he would have apologized or at least fixed the mistake without the attitude.

The waiters are always so jovial and friendly as well, providing excellent service and always coming by to check up on you. There is complimentary bread and olive oil/butter upon request. I personally enjoy the California pizza and Sicilian pizza, the former which makes me feel like I am opting for a healthier option (has leafy greens and avocado on top). ;) Last time, I tried the spinach and mushroom flatbread to be more adventurous, but the flatbread was way too oily for my liking.

I now come here at least once a month and am never disappointed with the food and the service. I am addicted to their avocado club egg rolls, filled with chicken, bacon, cheese and avocado... they are crispy on the outside and super delicious on the inside. They give you 6 large egg rolls cut in half (so 6 pieces) which is generous for an appetizer plate. I also love their crispy thin crust pizzas, especially the roasted artichoke and spinach. I can pretty much finish the whole thing on my own. I used to always get the Tostada pizza but now that they only serve it on thin crust, it's not the same and I don't like it as much. Finally their 2 in a bowl soup is great (Sedona Tortilla Soup + Split Pea). I thought it would be weird but they go together perfectly and both are delicious. If you want bread and butter w/ your soup you have to ask for it. They used to give you bread & butter automatically but I see they have stopped doing that. Service is always friendly and quick.

Basically NO asparagus on the asparagus arugula salad (one asparagus cut in fours and even the tip was gone!). We were told that they were out of bread and yet we saw other tables getting it, which I pointed out. The bread was finally give to us near the end of dinner.  Apparently they ""ran out of smashed pea and barley soup"" yet it was only 6 o'clock! I didn't know that was such a popular menu item on a hot day in Palo Alto! Once my soup came at the end of the meal when everyone else was finished, it was so watery, I felt like I was at a soup kitchen. What was weird is the flavor was there just not the insides! I don't even know how they could manage that. The water was never refilled. Our waitress Gloria just seemed like she didn't really care. She acted like she did to our faces but when she turned around, I think she probably made faces at us. We were never rude because I don't believe in that but more challenging: Her: ""Sorry, we are out of bread"" Me: ""really because I see people getting bread"" Her: ""Oh it just came out of the over"".  Me: ""SHouldn't mu salad have shaved parmesan"", Her,""Yes"". Me: ""Well, then can I have it because this doesn't have it."" Her: ""Ok"" 10 minutes later, no parmesan.  That sort of thing. Now I know why I rarely eat at CPK. The manager was nice but clueless as to how poorly his staff was at serving people because he came to see how things were and he had to have known because we didn't see him go to anyone else and yet when I said,""Not great"" he was like,""Really?"" all surprised.

Katie D.,"Los Gatos, CA",350,7,1,1.0,5/15/2014,"I usually love this place, but I recently went there last weekend just for a quick lunch.  When my mom and I first walked in and asked for a table, one of the hosts was quick to find a table and seat us but then one of the other co workers did not want them to seat us there so they were bickering in the front.  Next they sat us next to the door when it was a cold windy day and every time someone opened up the door we would get a gust of cold air so we decided to ask for another table that we saw open. The food was decent, and service was very slow.  We had to ask multiple times for our waters to be refilled and the waiter never once came back to check on how our food was doing.   As for the hosts, I could not enjoy my lunch because I was constantly bothered by how unprofessional they are.  One of the hosts was charging her phone and sitting on the bench, the other two were not paying attention at all to customers as they walked in  and were just talking and flirting.  When the next group of hosts came in for a shift change all of them were up at the front with there backs turned talking very loudly.  They were rude and disrespectful.  Might want to consider hiring people who actually want to work and help people instead of standing around doing nothing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palo-alto-3?start=120

However, the pizza was not hot enough, like it's been sitting outside for 5-10 min!!! We told the waiter and he brought it back to oven to reheat it. When it was brought back, the meat on the top were over-heated and too dry and crust were chewy. We just had a frozen CPK pizza last weekend and the frozen one even taste better!!

However, I've eaten at many different CPKs in different locations/states/countries, and this one has the worst wait staff of all!  I don't know if they're just less well trained, but the hosts have either been snotty, rude, or looked and sounded harassed.  And the wait staff oftentimes gets our orders confused.  I know their job is not easy, but c'mon, if they can't remember the orders in their heads, then they should write them down.  One time though, one of them wrote down the orders, and still got several of it wrong.

I typically rather have waiter service but this wasn't so bad. You place your order then find a seat (they give you a number) and they bring the food to you. You have to get your own drink (fast food style). They have seating inside and outside.  We ordered Waldorf salad with chicken and veggie works pizza. I must admit that although I wasn't expecting much, the food was pretty good. Not quite the best but we enjoyed it.  The only problem was that there is only one bathroom for each sex and there was a line for the ladies room. People that were sitting near the restrooms had to have people standing over them to use the bathroom. As I didn't feel very comfortable just standing around and looking at people eating, I decided to use the men's room. I don't understand why they don't just have a restroom sign since both bathrooms are exactly the same and this would prevent long lines in the ladies room.  Overall not a bad experience.

I work in the mall and I always have time to sit down and eat comfortably without being rushed. The beer selection is pretty good too.

My wife found her spaghetti to be a little too salty, my daughter's cheese pizza was....a cheese pizza. Our complimentary bread was delivered with a mumbled explanation about 3/4 or the way thru the meal. I got the creamy garlic pasta and for $3 had them add chicken which amounted to 8 (I counted them) measly chunks of chicken. They were hard to find being the same color of the cream sauce and pasta.

Alyssa W.,"Sunnyvale, CA",1,17,1,1.0,12/2/2015,"Normally, I would never write a review about this chain but this one evening was just horrible so I've decided to write about it. Two Saturday nights ago, my best friend and I came to this location for dinner. As well as to catch up. We walked in and the waiting area was over crowded of people waiting for a table. I walked up and put my name in, I was told it would be a 45 minute wait to sit inside. Agreeing, I looked around at the bar but there were only scattered empty seats. We waited aimlessly at the bar but it seemed no one wanted to move. My friend and I walked back to the waiting area where the hostess was trying to get people to eat outside in 50 degree weather. Even with heat lamps most turned her down. While I was waiting I almost slipped on their sticky floor twice and to be honest someone should have cleaned that. It's a hazard and if I would have fallen I would've be a happy campier. Still waiting for our table my friend and I could tell that the hostess was over worked and hadn't had a break. I truly felt sorry for her, you could tell she was overworked and needed someone to relieve her for a break. Finally, forty minutes later we were seated at a table. We waited five minutes which wasn't bad and a woman came to take our order for drinks. The waitress informed us that a gentleman would be taking over our table for her. The waiter came back with our drinks then we asked for a minute to order. As we still trying to make a decision with our order a couple gets seated two tables from us. The young man comes back and we order. Moments later he comes back with bread then leans across the table and starts discussing my friends tattoos. She was sweet enough to tell him then he kept staring at her. Just as he left, I saw the manager call him over and yell at him. Apparently, while he was flirting with my friend the couple two tables left in disgust. Now, I work in customer service myself and there is one thing you never do is yell at someone on the floor. Feeling a bit uncomfortable, I finish eating my bread and my friend stack our plates to let him know we're done with the bread. My friend asked for more so he went back for more. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw him come out of the kitchen with the bread. He drops a piece and kicks it to the side. Seriously? Come on! That's another hazard because someone could slip on it and fall. Our waiter comes back and give us back our dirty plates. No offense but he could have asked us if we wanted to use them before taking them or brought us new ones. Gross!! Thank goodness, our food finally comes and we start to finally enjoy. By the end of the end, I'm happy to get out of there. Never in my life have I experienced service so bad there. First of all that place needs more seating inside for cold days/nights such as that. Second, I thought the service was a bloody joke. I will not be returning to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palo-alto-3?start=180

Matt V.,"Sunnyvale, CA",672,313,59,3.0,1/31/2012,"This is a California Pizza Kitchen ASAP. I'm not sure exactly what that means, but I can tell you the differences that I've observed. The biggest difference is that instead of being a sit-down restaurant where you're served by wait staff, they have you start by ordering at the counter. You're given a number that you leave on your table, and they'll find you and drop off your pizza. I guess that makes it ASAP? Dunno. Whatevs. Service has always been fine. My pizza has come out quickly, and people are friendly. As for the taste, California Pizza Kitchen is decent, but there's better pizza out there. What I do like about it, and what would be the only reason for me to go there, is their creativity with toppings and combinations that other pizza places don't typically do. I also like their honey-wheat whole-grain option for the crust. A couple of my favorite flavors are the pear and gorgonzola, and the white pizza with applewood bacon. The pear and gorgonzola is just delightful. The sweetness of the pairs is balanced with the sharpness of the gorgonzola cheese. I also do like these kinds of flavors, that just make your taste buds dance. The white pizza is a bit milder; it comes with sauteed garlic spinach along with five different types of cheese: mozzarella, fontina, parmesan, ricotta, and pecorino romano. I've never been one to protest several different types of cheeses, but as you can see, the cheeses are much milder than the gorgonzola on the other pizza! I like ordering this one with applewood bacon tossed on it; the saltiness of the bacon adds a bit more flavor to the pie. Those are a couple of my favorites, although in general, I tend to avoid California Pizza Kitchen. There are definitely better options from local pizza places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palo-alto-3?start=180

It's not that clean. Our table felt sticky and it still smelled like the rags that they clean the table with. Yuck. Service was also meh. The one on Cowper is so much better since it's clean and there's more room to sit and breathe.  We also ordered some Spring Rolls for appetizers. Half were Thai Chicken (Peanut sauce, bean sprouts, scallions, carrots, cilantro and Mozzarella. Served with peanut sauce) and the other half were Mediterranean Veggie (Wild mushrooms, eggplant, sun-dried tomatoes, caramelized onions, Mozzarella and Parmesan. Served with marinara). Pictured above are the veggie ones, which I surprisingly preferred.  Anyway, I got the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pizza and split it with two others. It has Chipotle adobo sauce, shaved poblanos, Monterey Jack with house-made roasted corn & black bean salsa, cilantro and lime crema.

Chris M.,"Palo Alto, CA",11,207,350,2.0,6/22/2013,"I had high hopes for California Pizza Kitchen at the Stanford Shopping Center.  After all, I like the frozen version of their pizza.  If a company can make a frozen pizza taste this good, then the fresh pizza should be great too, right? Wrong. Not only was the pizza slightly lower-quality than one would expect for a restaurant at this price point, but I think that the $5 frozen variety (with the same name) from Safeway actually tastes better. The restaurant looked nice.  However, it was extremely crowded.  As a result, the staff seemed a bit...frazzled...by the amount of people.  We were finally seated after 40 minutes.  We quickly ordered our food and drinks.  Yet, ironically, we had to wait another hour before we received our meal.  The irony was that our food was cold when it was served.  The waitress wasn't even apologetic.   Oddly enough, we discovered that we had been overcharged for our tab when we arrived home.  It seems like the waitress accidentally added someone else's set of drinks to our bill.  Go figure. For the price of our meal (about $50 with food, drinks and tip), we should have opted for a more trusted establishment.  The next time that we are visiting the Stanford Shopping Center, we'll probably eat at THE MELT.  It is much less expensive and the food is better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palo-alto-3?start=100

Really wish I had more pain tolerance because it was very tasty!  2) Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage 3) Sicilian (thin crust) 4) Meat cravers (thin crust) I've tried the Original BBQ pizza as well, but I've learned I'm not a big sweet pizza person (aside from Hawaiian, maybe), so I wouldn't choose it over these 4. I also did prefer the original pizzas to their thin crust pizzas -- personal preference though.   + Waldorf salad: I'm biased here because this is one of my favorite types of salads, but it was really good! I do wish the ""full salad"" portion were bigger -- I came with a group of 3 and we definitely could have had more.  + Portion sizes: I came in a group of 3 hungry people and we ordered 2 pizzas and a salad.  - Wait time: It's usually long without a reservation, so I'd make one if possible. Both times I've come so far for dinner, the wait has probably been around 20-30 minutes. Service is also unfortunately pretty slow, but thankfully they do serve a bread plate to get you started.

Don't neglect it if you order the white pizza!  The Thai Crunch salad with avocado instead of chicken. Again, the rich, buttery avocado really makes the salad for me.

On 4/12/15, however, we had the most unpleasant experience with CPK stanford of my life.  We arrived at the CPK at 1:30 and was told to put down our names and the wait time would be 15 mins. We sat by the front desk and waited patiently. At 2:10, I saw parties that arrived much much later than us were getting seated and went to the front desk and asked about our table.  The girl calling the parties misspelled our name, but never called  even the misspelled name, and skipped our table. So 15 parties after us got seated, and we were still sitting next to her waiting to be called.  This girl with heavy eye makeup offered no apology whatsoever, and when the server (manager?) came to lead us to our table, she immediately started bad mouthing us in front of her coworker and other customers loudly--to the point that I can hear her calling us out!!! This is the most disgusting experience I have ever had in any restaurant, including fast food chains. CPK stanford -- your customer service training is appallingly inadequate, and your front desk staff needs an attitude adjustment. I don't believe I have the appetite to return to CPK ever again.  I had some good times at CPK, but won't miss them. When I see the palm tree logo of yours, all I can think of is that you hire people who are mean, rude, and unapologetic. Too bad.

Its really the only fast and reasonably priced place to eat at the mall that isn't fast food and has indoor seating. I wish the mall had more food options. That aside, I have slowly, over the past years, changed from indifference to a fan as their menu has expanded. I don't always want a pizza for lunch, I like healthy options, and their pizza in my opinion is good but not great. But I like their salads, and their turkey sandwich is really nice: hearty, fresh, and you can get it to go in a pre-pack. But the real special secret on the menu is the split pea soup. Yum! Comes with a roll, and I believe its vegetarian. On cold days this is perfect. A decent portion, very healthy. Yesterday I tried the pasta bolognese. I dread having pasta with a sweet tasting sauce, and this was great. It was hearty, al dente, and though it could have used a bit more meat, I thought it was very good. If I could change one thing about CPK it would be to have more diet soda options on the fountain. A diet sprite or lemonade would make me happy. I get tired of water, I don't drink caffeine and I don't want 300 calories worth of soda. And they definitely need to increase the seating here somehow outdoors if they can.

Who knew I'd be about-face with the cashier instead of in the back of the line. I had to casually exit through the doors to get inside through the proper entrance and with the rest of other diners waiting to order.  After placing my order for a Thai pizza and fountain soda, I was handed a numbered sign which I was place on the edge of the table. I grabbed a seat and noticed a lot of solo diners. The tables were arranged to accomodate small groups of 4 or so diners.  In any case, my pizza took 12 minutes from the time I ordered. It was freshly made, however, I wish I ordered the crust as whole wheat as it would have cut down on the tangyness of the Thai sauce. A little heavy in my opinion.  Great place to try if you want to have a pizza and I took half of mine home because while waiting for the pizza, I downed two cups of rootbeer.

On the other hand. they don't make pizza.  Simply putting stuff on baked dough does not make a pizza.   If you toasted a piece of bread, put chicken and ketchup on it, would you call it ""pizza""?  It might be a VERY nice meal, but would you call it ""pizza""? There is a particular pizza flavor, and you can get it all over the world it seems, in endless variations.  I love simple cheese plus tomato sauce, but even if you stick ham and pineapple on it, the pizza flavor comes through. ""California Pizza"" seems to go out of their way to offer ""pizza"" that has not even a hint of pizza flavor.   Why is this a big deal?  Because pizza is something very special, and they pretend to offer it, but they don't.   If you ordered filet mignon at a steakhouse, and they served you hamburger, would you object?  Even if it was a great hamburger?   Bottom Line:  Good food, bad pizza.  If they did not have ""pizza"" in the name, if they did not try to pawn this stuff off as pizza, I'd give them 4 stars.  It's a fun place to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palo-alto-3?start=220

Three hours later (on my lunch break) I dropped in to pick up my phone order, and I was grateful that they had my order ready for me, BUT I glanced down at the half Thai crunch salad that I had ordered and I see avocado slices everywhere.

This place is small and can only accommodate 150 people. The personal space between each table is small so you end up awkwardly squeezing yourself between the tables to get to your seat.  So, you wait in line. Cashier calls you, order, pay, and then get seated. I don't think I waited any longer than 12 minutes before my food arrived. I had a half-sandwich/half-salad combo with their new specials: Moroccan chicken salad, and cranberry walnut chicken sandwich. The Moroccan chicken salad was veryyyy good! It had huge pieces of avocado, hard-boiled eggs, beets, cranberries, and squash.

My family was walking around the mall when the kids decided that they are hungry when we walked by CPK. Fine, let's head in and grab a bite. The line wasn't that long to the cashier, but the wait took quite some time. I was also searching for a table which fits my family of 4 as well, and that was next to impossible. Luckily, the table that was sitting right by the cashier saw my dilemma and told me that they are leaving (that table also had kids so they can understand). We sat down, and finally the ordering took place and we all settled into our new table.  Since we just ""inherited"" this table from the previous family, it has not been cleaned and finding a waiter to clear our table was another difficult task. It wasn't until after our food arrived did we get the table cleared of all the old dishes.  The dining experience was just ok, nothing spectacular at this ""gourmet pizza establishment"". We also ordered a pasta dish (not from the kids menu) so the kids can eat it, but it wasn't very tasty and hence, they didn't eat much.  Needless to say, this all summed up to be a not so great experience.

The lady then told me that three people were ahead of us so, politely, I made sure she knew that arithmetic is not an opinion. 15 minutes later we were seated.

I had pizza at lunch and I ended up choosing pizza for dinner as well when I decided to try an original BBQ chicken pizza. The pizza itself was good and flavorful but nothing out of the ordinary. Later on I ordered a Belgian chocolate soufflé cake which I was expecting to be softer because a soufflé should be soft but it was very much like a brownie which is something that I don't really go crazy for anyway. Jorge was our waiter. He was very polite and courteous, even sarcastic but in a good way. He often came back to check on us.

Blue B.,"Palo Alto, CA",3,50,56,4.0,10/1/2013,"This is my typical family get-together restaurant. I've dined here ever since I was born and it always tastes better every time we come. We're never disappointed with the service or food.  My family's traditional order is 1 Large Wild Mushroom Pizza, 1 Medium Field Greens Salad, and 2 traditional cheese kids menu pizzas. Recently they have all been slightly altered. The original Wild Mushroom Pizza had their mushrooms wet and soggy. (Yes it does not sound too appetizing, but it actually tastes better since the mushrooms are easier to chew) The pizza wasn't too thin, and the dough was slightly sweet. Now they have changed the recipe so that the mushrooms don't get to be boiled, instead they are thrown onto the pizza, dry. The crust is also harder and not really sweet. The Field Greens Salad Dish was a salad with a variety of greens and leaves of all colors.  My family tradition was to exchange the chicken for shrimp and add extra walnuts. The walnuts were sugar coated which made them delightful to eat, and there were also apple slices. Together the salad tasted sweet, a tad bit sour (from the apples) and salty too. The texture was soft from the salad, chewy from the shrimp, and hard from the walnuts all at the same time. Now they have modified the salad to have goat chees mixed in, and to take out the apples. It changed the texture and flavors a ton, and it's no longer one of our favorite dishes, but we still order it for old time's sake. The kids cheese pizza was and still is just plain cheese pizza but smaller, with a sweeter thicker but softer crust. The only changes that have been made is that the dough is now thinner, and the pizza is cut into smaller pieces.   Overall still one of my favorite places to be. The staffs have always been polite and joyful when they're serving. The aura is always pleasant at CPK.
