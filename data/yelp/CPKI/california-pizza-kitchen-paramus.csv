Emery G.,"Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ",377,300,2058,5.0,1/11/2014,"This place is just amazing. I need to come back ASAP. This was my first time and it was a great experience. Yes it's small and they stack the tables on top of each other but it makes you feel like you're in New York. The server Rainbow was super nice and just perfect!! She was super sweet as well.  I signed up on the app before I came and they give you a free small plate. Ordered the quesadillas which were delicious even though they had black beans in it, which I hate. The ranch sauce was delicious as well, I think it had chipotle in it. Saved that for the pizza too. The BBQ chicken pizza was just perfect. The chicken was nice and soft and the BBQ sauce was nice and sweet with a slight tang. It was a great choice. Next time I come I have to get the cheese and tomato one. When Rainbow brought the check she also placed hand sanitizer on the table that smelled like beautiful oranges lol. It was lovely.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=40
Winiffer D.,"New York, NY",13,30,11,5.0,3/1/2016,"I absolutely love CPK. The food is great, the drinks are awesome and the atmosphere is always relaxed & not loud at all. It is a great place to take someone on a first date, or simply for an afternoon meal/drinks with friends.  Both locations I visited(NJ&NYC)had great waiters and they were highly professional. No complaints about the service.  Overall CPK is a great restaurant, I personally don't find anything wrong with it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=40

An O.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,,3.0,10/18/2016,"Service was okish, food was great.  They did have a lot of customers at the time, so I can understand the food taking longer than usual to prepare. However, I would have preferred it if the server didn't just ignore me until I could get close enough to talk to me even though they weren't helping anyone. Waitstaff seemed pleasant, cheerful, and quite helpful though. Been to CPK many times, always for a thin crust pizza. They are extremely consistent in quality and taste and the food is well worth the cost.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=40

Kimberly C.,"San Marino, CA",27,399,172,4.0,7/10/2016,"This is one of the nicer CPK's that I've been to. The wait was a little shorter than stated (10 instead of 15), which did mean we needed to stick close by since they would've given our table away. We were looking at the menu while we waited, so we ready to order when our server Gabby came by. It was a pretty basic experience for a chain restaurant. Definitely a nice option for a sit down place after walking around the mall.

Nichole M.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",0,1,,1.0,2/8/2017,3 hours for delivery service... horrible!!!!! Keep in mind it was being delivered only on the other side of the high way. Then I was talked to as if I was wrong for being upset that it took 3 hours to get food that I paid $60 for. They wrote my credit card number down and told me they do it all time. Came 3 hours later and with no receipt. Dropped the food and left. The manager was extremely sincere and apologetic. However the staff needs a retrain on how to deal with people in general. I was told well you know delivery does take a long time. I said yes it does but not 3 hours. Took at least 45 minutes to place the order since I was placed on hold for 45 minutes. I had to hang up and call back 3 times because everyone that put me on hold forgot about me. Maybe 2 hours at most. Never again!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=40

Ritam G.,"Edison, NJ",34,27,20,4.0,6/5/2016,"Came here on a Thursday night with a friend around 8 PM. We called around 715 to sign up on their ""waiting list"" and were seated within 2 minutes. For appetizers we ordered the tortilla spring rolls (basil & thai chicken) and they came with a sauce (which I didn't particularly care for) and guacamole that was surprisingly spicy & tasty. We ordered 2 pizzas between us two, and went with a whole wheat tostada and a thin crust sicillian. The tostada comes with a refreshing tomato salsa & has the option of adding lime roasted chicken. The sicillian was very good w/ a sweet tomato sauce that went perfectly with the salty meat on the pizza. The tostada was especially crispy topped with a perfect ammount of crunchy & fresh lettuce. For dessert we shared the chocolate brownie souffle & ice cream and it was delicious! All in all I was very happy with my meal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=40
Jung Eun L.,"Englewood, NJ",6,7,,1.0,2/6/2016,"Really disappointed. The Waldorf salad from CPK is one of my favorite salads and was much looking forward to having one. Went to the GSP location and was pleasantly surprised when we were seated right away. However, after we were seated we waited... and waited... and waited. Servers were all around us, bustling past us but we never got one to stop. We watched as others were seated and promptly received their drinks and their food.  In the end we just walked out. No server, no water even, and no salad. I will seek out another location for my salad fix.

Anthony B.,"Lodi, NJ",31,135,2,3.0,2/8/2015,"Ambiance/Decor/Atmosphere: Slightly on the boring side; almost diner like with the wood tables and brown color all over.  The tile pizza oven area is pretty eye catching, and there is a counter in front where you can sit and watch people cook.  The counter is a hit and a miss at the same time to me; it seems like a bar to drink at, but at the same time where you'd eat at in a diner.  I'm not sure if a diner feel is what they are going for, but what the hell........ Noise/sound level: LOUD as hell.  CPK is popular because of the offerings and it will almost always be crowded in this location.  You won't really have to yell to your guests, but you might have to speak louder than desired. Menu: The menu is on the verge of being gigantic; composed of many different tapas, appetizers, meals, desserts, and drinks.  But, it covers almost every option under the sun so whatever you want, you more than likely can get it at CPK. Service: The wait staff was friendly, accommodating, informative, helpful, and ticket times were as expected considering the amount of people eating. Food: My wife and I frequented CPK twice and haven't really had a chance to go back since.  The first time we went nuts; we had mac and cheese bites, tortilla spring roles, lettuce wraps, the dumplings.  The second time we had spicy sausage pablano and fennel flatbread, fish tacos, and the bianco flatbread.  Overall, I gather some of the food is frozen but the general presentation and flavor is not bad.  The food is fun and tastes as good as a chain restaurant can provide.   Bar: Full.  The fact this place is in the mall and you can get sloshed in it is crazy.  The beer selection is decent considering and the prices aren't too bad. Price: Each plate alone might not cost a lot, but the serving size will trick you.  Once you order a few dishes it will get expensive fast.  I don't think I've left here spending less than $60 for two people.  It's not too big of an issue though; you're here to have fun. Overall: I definitely want to return and try the habanero pizza, but be forewarned your experience might be detracted some if it's busy.  The second time we visited we were packed in like sardines so close to everyone else.  It was so tight I could smell the dude's breath next to me. Also, CPK delivers here, but for $100 minimum. (per their site)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=40

Hsu B.,"Teaneck, NJ",0,1,,1.0,9/7/2016,The waiter seemed not so happy to have us dining there. With extraordinary poker face and not willing to fake a smile toward your costumer.

Patricia O.,"Manhattan, NY",4,21,,1.0,1/15/2016,"I've eaten here plenty of times and the food itself is consistently ok - a solid 3 stars. However, this evening I experienced such rude service I was compelled to yelp. I was with my parents and 9 month old baby and made a reservation in front of the hostess for 3. When our name was called, the waiter or host Matt looked at us and the baby, clearly exasperated and annoyed, and said we should have said table of 4 and by doing so we could not be seated then because a high chair would require extra set up. He insisted on telling us we should have said 4 if we wanted a high chair. I saw a stack of unused high chairs in the waiting area. It wasn't for lack of high chairs that we couldn't be seated right away. It was rude of him to point fingers so quickly. If there was a question about whether we needed a high chair, they should have clarified this when we made the reservation. I wasn't hiding my baby.  Goodbye CPK. Last time I eat at a place that likes to place blame on potential diners instead of remaining calm and respectful in innocuous and common situations such as these.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=40

Bhavnit K.,"Jersey City, NJ",95,81,902,4.0,8/1/2017,"Found it in the WestField Mall. I had no idea of this branch but so happy to see. Checked in around noon on Saturday. It was not so crowded. Started with Fresh and soft bread with Olive oil. Never had such soft bread at any Restaurant. The waitress was nice and asking for anything required oftenly. I was with my husband who is a pizza eater. So we ordered a chipotle chicken pizza and chicken lettuce wraps.  Chipotle Chicken Pizza- 4/5 It was as usual as other CPK(Amean in California), it came with ranch sauce but it was tasty w/o the sauce. The only thing I felt bad about the pizza, it was cold. Chicken Lettuce Wraps- 4/5 Loved them, so crispy the chicken and the filling was but was very oily. It came with 5-6 fresh lettuce wraps. Overall it was a nice experience cz I love CPK :) Dint have their dessert but will try it soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus
Mary L.,"Glen Rock, NJ",0,12,1,3.0,12/27/2017,"In a word Disappointing.  All be it, it is two days after Christmas and the mall is as busy as a bee hive. This was our first time here. The experience was a disappointment.  When we first arrived we asked how long was the wait and were told 15 minutes.  We were a party of 5 with 3 children.  Three hungry children and we waited almost an hour not 15 minutes as promised for a table.  By the time we sat down we were all so hungry the entire menu looked delicious and by delicious I mean I was ready to eat paper. Our server appeared blissfully unaware of our wait.  He suggested a couple of cocktail off the drink list but never bother to suggest that we get the lunch special which would have saved us quite a bit of cash given we ordered a salad and one pizza to share. The mixed drinks were not good and we left them almost completely full. Our food did come out quickly actually before the driinks ever made it to the table. We got the quinoa arugala salad and the chicken artichoke pie.  Both were very good.  The portion of the kid's meals were pretty large size but the orders came out all wrong.  We just couldn't wait for the remake.  I'm hoping it's not always like this but who knows since this was our first visit.   All and all 3 kids meals.with kid drinks, two cocktails, one pizza and one salad came to 85.00.  We should have just gone to the food court would have been quicker and cheap.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus

At every restaurant I go to, I always ask for a tiny bit extra sauce cause I don't like my pasta dry. Never have I ever been charged extra.

Sue L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",149,29,80,4.0,12/26/2017,"The wait was about 15 minutes for a party of 3 on a Friday afternoon, which isn't terrible. The waiter was really nice and tried to to be attentive, but it was just so busy in the restaurant that it was hard to be. I got the Blackberry Bramble as my drink, and it was really good. It's made of Bacardi Limon and ginger beer, with lemonade and blackberries. We also got the Avocado Club Egg Rolls to start, which were delicious as always. I ordered the Kung Pao Spaghetti as my main, which was a little disappointing because the noodles tasted overcooked. Finally, we got the Butter Cake for dessert, which tasted pretty average. The bill came out to almost $100 for lunch for three people, which is very overpriced. Maybe not a place that I'll come to often, but pretty solid food after a long morning of shopping.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus

One of the waiters had an accident and poured the entire plate of Thai peanut sauce on my favorite sweat shirt.  I tried wiping it off but without any success!  The middle of my sweater looked like puke on it :( The restaurant manager Jesse Eyrich came for this situation which made matters a million times worse.  He was rude and humiliating.  He said  that he can give me $5 to buy a new sweater at JC Penny or bring back the dry cleaning receipt for reimbursement.  Where do you get a $5 Nike sweatshirt?!  Or any sweater that's $5?!

The food looked really good but I wasn't too happy about it.  Guacamole tasted really good but was a very very small portion. I would suggest charging a couple bucks more and making it a bit larger.  The flatbread was ok, nothing special. The pizza is what I didn't like at all. The dough felt like toasted soggy bread and the toppings were all over the place with barely any chicken.

I ordered a thin-crust Sicilian pizza and it was so damned hot (spicy hot, not heat hot) that it was almost inedible. I like spicy food and thought this was awful.  The place was filthy. The bathroom was a disaster. The women's room had one toilet out of service, another sporting a huge mess (what woman takes a dump that large?) and a very messy accessible stall. Ugh.

We get to the place and the hostess was not as cordial that I would wanted her to be but sometimes that happens. We got a table and we started to view the menu when my daughter pointed out to me that they had a carne asada pizza and it was a new item, I was glad and of course, I ordered.

Karin G.,"Clifton, NJ",69,113,85,1.0,9/16/2016,"So sad to see how much this place went down hill. Came here on a Sunday recently.  After being ignored the first 3 minutes, we saw a girl behind the bar and said 'excuse me' to get her attention.  She was the nastiest person I ever interacted with at a restaurant.  'YES?!' As if we interupted her life (not task, life) I asked if we entered the restaurant properly and if there was a hostess.  She snapped again 'WELL WHAT DO YOU WANT' we were shocked.  We asked if they were open and if we could be seated, she started looking around like we were idiots.  We were so taken back, finally someone came from the back and asked if we wanted to be seated.  We immediately asked what the woman's problem was.  We even offered to leave because we couldn't understand why she was so unbelievably nasty to us.  Our waiter apologized a few times for that woman's behavior.  The best part was she was wearing different clothes than everyone so I assume she was a manager (the nasty woman behind the bar). Things calmed down.  We ordered 2 five cheese pizzas with sauce.  We were sat next to the window, facing the inside of the mall.  The plates, napkins & utenesils were behind us on a ledge filled with 1/4 inch of dust & dirt.  I am confident that the ledge hasn't been wiped down since 2015, more so 2014.  Besides that, the window was FILLED with fruit flies.  I am talking at minimum 14 and max 23 each time I counted.  It was so gross.  It was very telling to the cleaning habits of thos restaurant. The food went down hill.  The pizza wasn't even half as good as I remember.  Pizza dripped with oil.

Anna I.,"Staten Island, NY",125,82,59,4.0,3/15/2016,"I came here for lunch on a Friday afternoon. The hostess said the wait was 5-10 minutes; I was surprised, but we were seated in around two minutes.  The server was quick and attentive despite the restaurant being busy. If it's this crowded on a Friday afternoon, though, I suspect it can be packed on Friday or Saturday nights.  Regardless, we both got lunch specials. I ordered the mushroom and spinach lunch sized pizza with the spinach and quinoa salad. The food came quickly and was pretty good! Not stellar, but in my experience CPK does not have food to write home about.  If you want a cheap and fast lunch at GSP I'd probably go with something in the food court, but I think this is a great option if you want to be served.

This time, however, service was painfully slow during the whole time. Food wise, the Caesar salad dressing was odd tasting (perhaps stale), croutons were definitely stale.  Pepperoni pizza was too spicy and heavy on sodium. Marinara sauce requested on the side was also stale.  Lemonade didnt seem fresh at all. Hope they improve themselves going forward.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus

Lisa M.,"Rockland County, NY",235,100,356,4.0,2/20/2016,"So this was my second visit here and of course, I cannot complain. This is the first restaurant where I actually sat at the bar to order my food and I realized you get your food MUCH faster when you sit at the bar (wink wink, nudge nudge).  I got the Pesto Cream Penne and doused it with hot sauce :-) Absolutely delicious! I added chicken with it. Last time, it was chicken + shrimp. I also tasted the Hawaiian Pizza but I made the mistake of putting hot sauce on it because I love putting hot sauce on everythang.. but pineapple and hot sauce do not mix. Keep that in mind! Next time I visit, I must try the alcoholic beverages. Sitting at the bar and watching the bartender make those pretty drinks has me wanting to come back just for those!

My friend and I shared the guacamole and chips for an appetizer and the wild mushroom pizza with truffle oil. They were both really good. We also each ordered sangria.

Just wish it was spicier. The Roasted Garlic and Chicken pizza was also really tasty and fresh.  Had great flavor! Our waitress was friendly, quick and attentive.

I also ordered the macaroni and cheese bites that were coated in panko bread crumbs and fried to a perfect golden brown. It was served over a cheese sauce that was to die for. My fried ordered the spring rolls that were served with guacamole on the side. My boyfriend and I ordered the garlic chicken pizza that was very yummy. My friend got the tostada pizza and didn't like it so she got the garlic chicken pizza as well.

Linda P.,"Fort Lee, NJ",0,21,,1.0,9/30/2015,"Stay clear of this place. The staff is rude, the manager argues with the customers and if you order the garlic chicken, be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes while the staff turns chicken breast that should take only a couple minutes on top of the stove to cook, into shoe leather because they BAKE it, despite it being deboned chicken. The sauce is over salted. The vegetables few and far between. The only good thing about this place is their pizza and their salads. But with an attitude of ""the customer is not right"" this is a place to avoid. I spoke with the manager to tell him we waited 20 minutes for the chicken and there was no apology just an announcement telling me that the way they cook chicken takes 20 minutes. When I asked him why it wasn't stated as such on the menu, he said the problem was 'corporate' and that maybe he would notify them.  The music was turned up to strength ten and my husband and I had to ask the gal who waited on us, twice, to please turn down the music. She finally did but not eagerly.

Paul W.,"Englewood Cliffs, NJ",0,16,27,2.0,8/10/2016,"What started out somewhat promising, turned to general disappointment. After years of passing by this chain-restaurant, we spontaneously decided to give it a try. They had 2 hostesses out front, but rather than offer seating options, both just said ""hello"" to us. We sat at the bar/counter and were told by a waitress that she'd be ""a few minutes."" That should have been our cue to depart. After about 5 minutes, she returned to take our drink order. She returned promptly with both drinks & took our food order. The salad & wine arrived promptly, but that's when time stopped. We waited and watched as several other diners, one right next to us and each having arrived after us, were served appetizers & main courses. Also, right next to our seats was the take-out station, where at least 3 people came in, ordered & left with their food before us. This is when we inquired about our order, only to be told twice that it would be delayed; ""we're really backed-up"" - even though there were several tables & seats at the counter empty. Finally after another 5 minutes, we were told by who we assumed to be a manager, that our food ""should be out soon."" Then I noticed the guy seated next to us rolling his eyes & shaking his head, so we told her we were done waiting. That's when my fish arrived, but my wife's pizza was just going into the oven. Yes, we could see all of the kitchen activity. Maybe they should re-look that feature. I will say they were all very apologetic and the manager even told us there would be no charge for our salad & drinks, which was unexpected & appreciated. Of course we gave the waitress a reasonable tip. But, had I been managing there, I would have ""comped"" the appetizer & drinks sooner. (Btw, the La Crema Pinot Noir was very good!)

The food was good, but I was expecting it to be better -- especially because there is always a ton of people here. For appetizers my table ordered the Bianco Flatbread, which is a small plate & a new menu item. I was a fan of this, because the flatbread is drizzled with truffle oil and you can pretty much put truffle oil on anything and I'll love it. We also ordered the  Spicy Chicken Tinga Quesadilla and the ranchito sauce that it came with really made this dish a hit.  It was REALLY good. As part of our main dish, we shared the California Club, Lettuce Wraps, and the Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings. The pizza crust was really good but I probably wouldn't get the California Club again. It was pretty much salad on a pizza. It made the pizza difficult to eat. The service was pretty good.

Carol S.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",87,65,67,4.0,1/31/2014,"My friend's mother wanted to eat out with me. WIthout my friend. Yes it was a little strange hahah. But it was a Thursday for party of 2. At CPK, you can call ahead 30 minutes to put your name on the waiting list though they don't necessarily reserve. I called ahead for 5:45 PM but when we got there, there were a plenty of empty tables. The traffic around the area at that time is an absolutely pain as everyone heads home for work or out for dinner, so you can expect the mall parking to be kind of horrendous too. Oh that's another thing, it's actually inside the mall, not like one of those restaurants that have a direct outside entrance. We were able to get a free Small Plate by registering with the CPK app on my smartphone. Jessica, our server, was quick to take down my account number and immediately put it into the system (grateful! I read about how much of a hassle getting this free small plate was at some CPKs). We got the White Corn Guacamole & Chips. Came out in a matter of 2 minutes-- awesome!! The amount of guac they give you is about 3 tablespoons. A lot less than we expected for the amount of chips we got. However, good and I s'pose it is afterall just an appetizer. I just think they should portion the ratio better. We ordered the California Club and the Kung Pao Spaghetti, both to share. When Jessica took our orders, she reassured us that they were great selections! Especially being a first time visitor. We waited about ten minutes and Jessica refilled out waters in between. Food came out. Though the California Club didn't have that zangy tangy kick I was looking for like in a BBQ pizza, and appeared rather unappetizing because it looks like a salad on top of a pizza, I actually enjoyed it! It did not feel like a guilt-heavy pizza. There were pieces of bacon throughout and the lemon-pepper mayonnaise was the most flavorful. I don't think I'd get it again though. The KUNG PAO SPAGHETTI however was bursting with flava! The shrimp was so very perfect. Perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked. Noodles were a little more than al dente but not anywhere near mush which is what I LOVE. It also was a little spicy and just had all the right combinations to round out a good twist on a Chinese classic. I think this dish would be great for asian parents who don't typically enjoy going to non-asian restaurants because it doesn't ""fit their taste"". Jessica, being pregnant, was so on top of her game. Checked back once, and came back to drop the dessert menu once (which we didn't have room for). I saw her from my peripheral waiting on standby for any of our needs, but never intruding, bothering, or rushing us. We spent a full hour & 15 minutes there in wonderful conversation. She filled my water a total of three times and was the kindest. Bill came out to $30. Left a 20% tip, totally deserved! Go Jessica.

It was pretty decent. This time I had the Moroccan Chicken Salad which hit the spot. It has a little bit of everything and what I did like is that they didn't drench the salad in dressing like most places do. For some reason I hate that & I usually ask for dressing on the side.  Even though it was pretty quiet this time, I felt like it took as long for the food to come out as it does on a busy day. I liked how the waitress knew her customers and catered to them accordingly.

Nicole L.,"Philadelphia, PA",262,493,33,2.0,6/12/2012,"Don't know what the heck was going on last Saturday, but honestly, I really don't care either. I will say that the entire experience is A LOT worse during the dinner rush at 7 in the evening than at 4 pm.  First off, the beeping guest pager was not working right (Haha, unintentional pun on ""beeping""). It would beep when I was more than 5 steps from the entrance, even though the hostess assured me that it works all the way down the hall.  The hostess who sat us made this HUGE fuss about how we didn't specify that we needed a highchair when we first put our names down, even though we have NEVER been asked about it that early. I think it's completely unprofessional to blame US for this. She put the three of us into a booth that would have fit 6 people (the only bright spot of the experience), and said that a highchair wouldn't fit, but they have a booster seat available (which worked fine). The usual crayons and paper menu was also provided. The server was nice, and we quickly ordered a milk for the little one and just some ice waters for us. We tried out the hawaiian pizza (even though it's not our usual order) and I got a BBQ chicken chopped salad (as usual). We also thought we'd try out the mac and cheese on the kid's menu to keep our little one occupied.  The food was really disappointing.  I was confused at how small my salad looked, and when I was finally able to flag down the server and asked about it, she said that she ""thought you ordered the half size."" At that point, I realized that unlike my other times, she did not ask me what size salad I would like, and I was too busy trying to save the table top from being drawn on to have noticed. She DID offer to switch my salad to a full sized one, but I was SO hungry and it took such a long time to flag my server down that I was just like... whatever. This was my choice, one that I bitterly regret, to this day. My husband's pizza was RIDICULOUSLY small. I mean... Other $14 pizzas are hanging off the side of the plate, and his didn't even make it to the inside rim. It was at least 2 inches (which in a circle is a big deal) smaller than the other pizzas we saw coming out of the kitchen. I don't know what the hell happened but quality control was completely lacking that day. The taste was only OK, since we tried something new, and didn't like it, I would have liked to ask the server to change it for our usual order (per their menu suggesting that we try something new)... but again, not being able to find your server just means that the kitchen will get less complaints (as most of us just throw up our hands and say ""screw it""), and more bad Yelp reviews.  The mac and cheese was absolutely atrocious. The pasta was cooked a bit under, which is OK if you're an adult as some people like that, but less acceptable when it's for a very young kid (and a baby, none-the-less).  Maybe next time, we need to specify that the pasta be fully cooked, but I would have thought that to be obvious. Also, there was SO little cheese sauce, that it was just a macaroni dish. When we were finally able to find our server, we asked for more cheese sauce, and granted, she was good about bringing that. But again, not sure what was going on that day. At least their private bathrooms had a changing table, which I did appreciate (and use). Overall, this was an extremely disappointing meal and I will not be coming back to this location. I've had very good experiences at the Willowbrook Mall location, and will head out there from now on when the craving hits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=100
J L.,"Hackensack, NJ",27,64,37,3.0,6/23/2013,"OK pizza.  NY style will always be king. As I was saying, California style pizza isn't amazing in my honest opinion.  This place has some decent beer, a better wine list, and a non pizza menu that is pretty good.  This place can get packed on the weekend and I usually see people eating the pizza.  Not sure why because the rest of the food is much better.  It's a thin crust style, but the crust itself doesn't have that crisp texture of the right taste.  Cheese and sauce aren't anything super flavorful either.  Flavor profiles like California Club or Habanero Carnitas aren't really pizza, they're pizza shaped, but certainly not pizza.  Better alternatives are things like the Fire-Roasted Chile Relleno or Jambalaya Fettuccine.   Bottom Line: The pizza is MEH.  The rest of the food isn't bad and the wine is good (Although a tad overpriced).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=100

I like pea soup. I mean, I really like pea soup. This is a good one. I think it's a veggie version because there's no hint of ham or any meat in it. Still good and hearty though.  The half Thai Chicken salad was fun, and that's what I was looking for: a healthy fun salad. Lots of nuts, rice noodles, fresh greens, chicken, edamame beans and crunch. They charge $2.50 for about half an avacado added. I went for it and it was a good quality addition. Very good salad size for a half salad. I was stuffed and content.

Pizzas:   Our favorite is the Thai Chicken Peanut, my son loves the original pizza, my husband recently tried the Carne Asada and loved it.

Mark N.,"Point Pleasant Beach, NJ",46,196,177,4.0,5/7/2009,"I've been visiting this California Pizza Kitchen for several years. First and foremost, the pizza here is amazing - if you've never visited a CPK, let this specific one be your first experience. Nothing beats great pizza, quality beer on tap and a view of the mall's atrium for some quality people-watching. This California Pizza Kitchen is located at the back of the Garden State Plaza, which some would view as a good location, whereas others would consider it a huge pain (you'll have to park a significant distance away, and wait for the crossing guard to stop traffic). Due to the popularity of the place and its high profile location, you should expect to wait a good half hour or more during 'prime time', such as Friday afternoons, nights, and especially Saturdays (never mind Sundays - thanks to the idiotic Blue Law in Bergen County, where everything is closed on Sunday, making Saturdays a drudgery on New Jersians). California Pizza Kitchen's specialty are their signature pizzas - there is literally something for everyone there. For those who don't like anything or are plain boring, a plain pizza or one with traditional toppings could always be ordered. So, regardless of if you like barbecue chicken bits, pineapple, avocado, Italian sausage or fresh tomato on your pizza, there's most likely a ""themed"" pizza that has it. For a heart attack on a platter, try the BLT (yes, that does mean bacon, lettuce, tomato & mayo) pizza! Everything is prepared out in the open, which is a style I personally love as a customer...transparency is good, especially in the restaurant business. (Addition: April 2010): The cheeseburger pizza is here, and oh man, is it good. This California Pizza Kitchen is always busy and packed. My only complaint is that if you don't get a booth seat, you're going to get a tiny square table, and will be practically rubbing elbows with the people next to you - not to mention, you'll be talking over each other's conversations. If you're in a party of two, don't expect to ever get seated at a booth. Personally, I like some distance when I'm at a restaurant of any kind - even a fast food place, and you simply won't have that here. CPK's prices are reasonable. Personally, I can finish an entire pizza on my own, including an appetizer (highly recommend the dumplings) and something for dessert (key lime is my favorite). The pizza size is comparable to a small at Pizza Hut. The waiters & waitresses there are top notch - they never forget about you and are always very courteous. Overall, a great and very unique pizza place that is in one of the most crowded and hectic malls in Jersey.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=120
Shannon O.,"Westwood, NJ",1,7,,5.0,7/2/2012,"This place is delicious!! It's not the healthiest and its not terribly unhealthy but if you get a salad you'll be fine! The salads are delicious as well as the pizza!! I like the Waldorf chicken salad with vinaigrette dressing and my favorite pizza is the BBQ chicken pizza!

We always go with kids meal for my son and daughter and for me and my wife we always liked their spagetti kung pao noodle it's the best and lettuce wrap, both a big hit for us. These 2 items bring us to the place once in a while if we're in the mood for it. overall good place to go, friendly staff and good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=120
marcello L.,"Yonkers, NY",2,20,,4.0,4/9/2009,The best cpk hands down. The only ones that rival are the midtown ones. Your order comes out fast and well made. Never had a problem at this cpk  (The one on 56th tried to poison us... then we got free food for it) Go with the shrimp scampi and some focaccia bread. The best part. ALCOHOL!!!

Efren C.,"Little Ferry, NJ",174,29,42,4.0,6/1/2016,If you are going for lunch on the weekend try to beat the rush by coming before 1230pm or you'll be waiting a while.  Service was great my waiter was very attentive and kept our water glasses full. He gave us bread right away and took our orders quickly.  Try the wheat hummus for appetizer and Thai chicken pizza. I personally like the crust and the flavor of the dish. My kids loved the Hawaiian pizza mainly because they miss the island itself but I'm sure it was good anyway.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=20

Becky W.,"New York, NY",318,21,15,4.0,1/11/2016,"I love CPK! Went around 2PM and it was packed, but managed to get a table within 10min. The tables were pretty close together, but service was great.  The pizza was really good, but it was cut weird - one of the slices took up almost 1/3 of the pizza. One pizza is definitely too much for one person though. One pizza and a side is probably good for 2. They also had siracha sauce as an add-on, which I thought was interesting! Would try that next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=20
John W.,"New York, NY",0,6,,3.0,7/1/2017,"Really enjoyed my experience here, service was fine but the food was really good.

Miriam G.,"Teaneck, NJ",198,37,18,5.0,5/31/2017,I used to come here all the time for their pizza because let's be honest the pizza is AMAZING. My go to pizza is the veggie pizza because I love the flavor of all the veggies on that perfect slice. Recently I have been trying to stay away from carbs and I have found that their Roasted Veggie Salad is perfect for that! I either add a hard boiled egg or fresh grilled salmon. My boyfriend who loves seafood adds shrimp. It is great!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=20

Melinda P.,"Hackensack, NJ",79,29,5,1.0,1/29/2017,You do NOT want service like this. I had the worst experience ordering California Pizza Kitchen through GrubHub. I ordered a Chinese Chicken Salad and they forgot the dressing. I called back to see if they could accommodate me and the manager (Vanessa) was extremely rude. She would adjust the price of the dressing off of my bill. That seems to be the least CPK could do. I'm extremely disappointed and will not be eating there again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=20
Peter T.,"Ramsey, NJ",268,19,19,4.0,1/9/2016,I'm a big fan of pizza and this place is one of my preferred spots. Came on a Saturday afternoon around 1pm. Place was busy and crowded as expected but didn't have to wait more than 15 minutes.  First off the server was incredibly nice. Her friendly demeanor made it a pleasant experience. I got the Jamaican jerk chicken pizza. I've had it before and it was pretty good but it's been over a year. This time I don't know if they changed it or added something but it's even better and has a spicy kick to it that wasn't there before,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=20
Marissa K.,"Teaneck, NJ",86,116,366,4.0,9/1/2016,Drinks were delicious. Had the Moscow mule and blood orange sangria. The sangria was a little sweet. The Thai chicken pizza's sauce is so yummy.

Dom P.,"Saddle River, NJ",0,21,,1.0,7/12/2017,"What happened to this place?  Food is marginal, wait staff do more clowning around than working, including throwing ice at each other!  It is overly noisy and doesn't feel clean.  I used to be a regular...no more.  I went to their website a while back to voice my concerns about this location and was given a ""case number"".  Still haven't heard back!  Tried it again a few weeks ago and decided that this location, and perhaps chain, have seen their best days.  With all one hears about mall traffic being down, you would think that service and food would be better.  You would think.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=20
Jenny K. L.,"Oradell, NJ",166,489,472,4.0,1/31/2015,"I haven't been here since 1999 when I used to work as a hostess during one college summer job. So much has changed including the menu! How could they have gotten rid of the Rosemary chicken and potato pizza?!!!??? We came Friday night and was shocked that there was no wait. I was even more shocked that they added tables on the 2 floor between the booths. Some advice-if the hostess seats you at the first table on the 2nd floor in between the booths asked to be moved. We kept getting bumped around as people were being walked to their tables by the food runners and bussers. Worst seat ever. Our server Brittany however was awesome! She made great recommendations and was really engaging and sweet! Their new agave mojito was watered down, but their strawberry basil martini was delicious. Unfortunately not consistent though because the 2nd martini I ordered was overly sweet and viscous as if they didn't water it down with the alcohol; I couldn't even finish it.  The Moroccan salad was pretty good with a lot of ingredients and flavors going on. The chipotle pizza was awesome, and I especially loved the lime&cilantro creme on it. We then couldn't decide between the Thai pizza or the spinach & artichoke pizza. Brittany suggested getting half and half so we did and I wish we had listened to Brittany from the get go and just gotten the whole spinach &  artichoke pizza, it was aweeeesome!! Great chunks of fresh garlic and the wood burned artichoke is killer. Definitely recommend all the food we had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=20
Nicole S.,"Hoboken, NJ",175,294,302,4.0,10/1/2014,"Now I know this is called ""pizza kitchen"" but I am in love with their Quinoa and Arugala Salad in their ""Lite Adventures"" section.  No matter what salad you get, make sure to try the Champagne Vinaigrette...SO GOOD!  The Quinoa Salad is healthy, fresh, and delicious.  I actually have yet to try their pizza, but their flat breads are around 400 calories for a meal. Not bad.  We usually place our order online (from work office) and it's always ready when they say it will be ready. No complaints with CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=20

Jun C.,"New York, NY",25,173,107,4.0,2/24/2015,"I absolutely love this place.  This CPK, along with the Nordstrom Marketplace Cafe, and Zin Burger are my three favorite restaurants in Garden State Plaza.  Even on busy days, the wait is never terribly long; at most I've waited 15 minutes.  The servers are very friendly and attentive.  This place has a wide selection of different foods, and almost everything that I've tried here has tasted fantastic.   My favorite pizza is definitely the Sicilian Pizza, which is one of their Crispy Thin Crust Pizzas.  It consists of spicy marinara, parmesan cheese, oregano, and basil, combined with a medley of different meats (ham, Italian sausage, salami).  The meats and spices combine to create an absolutely incredible pizza.  I'm usually not a huge fan of crust (don't worry, I still eat crust, I just don't enjoy it), but the crust here is so good.  It's got crunch to it, but is also soft inside.  In addition to the Sicilian Pizza, other thin crust pizzas that are good are the Jamaican Jerk Chicken and Margherita.  The Jamaican Jerk Chicken consists of bacon, onions, peppers, spicy Caribbean sauce, and other flavors that I don't really know, but enjoy the taste of.  This is one of those pizzas that I enjoy 2 or 3 slices, but never seem to finish the whole thing on my own, since BBQ style sauces sometimes overpower the taste.   Other things that taste good here are the Spaghetti Bolognese, which is classic.  Their meat sauce is so much better than anything I can ever hope to replicate at home.  The Jambalaya Fettuccine is pretty good as well.   Another aspect of CPK that I love is that the franchise likes to experiment with new flavors, cuisines, and cultures.  For instance, I once had a Korean BBQ Steak Taco which was so freakin good.  I think it was on their special menu or something, they have really interesting and tasty specials.    The layout of the restaurant is great, fits a good amount of people, and is clean.  They also have a bar with a TV, so if you're on your own, not a bad idea to sit there if you feel awkward sitting on your own.  I always ask for a booth seat when I go, but that's more a personal preference.  I'm looking forward to coming back again and again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=20
Nancy T.,"Austin, TX",697,22,118,4.0,8/2/2016,"CPK has always been a go-to restaurant of mine. It's a great place to grab lunch or dinner with friends and family, and is a suitable environment to chit-chat for an hour or two. I remember in high school, I used to come here with a huge group of girls on the weekend and talk for hours over some yummy food. I usually get the original BBQ chicken pizza which they are famous for and it is so delicious. I can barely finish it myself! I've recently tried the Thai Crunch salad with avocado, which had lots of veggies, cilantro, peanuts, rice sticks, chicken and all tossed in a sweet peanut dressing. I only got the half salad which was still plenty of food! Every bite was so yummy and full of flavor! I love a good salad. I'll definitely be ordering this again. I also liked that we got warm bread with flavored olive oil in the beginning! It was a nice little appetizer. I only gave this place 4 stars because it's still a chain restaurant and their dishes aren't completely unique.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=20
Lori M.,"Cresskill, NJ",1,16,9,5.0,10/24/2016,Love this place. Love the Thai chicken pizza is a favorite. the red sangria is the best. the spring rolls are delicious. love when they have specials. favorite place to eat,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=20
Janice L.,"Roselle Park, NJ",607,889,123,3.0,5/7/2015,"I have been here a few times as it's been a staple of the mall forever. They even deliver within the mall if you work at one of the stores. Weekends and nights, there is usually quite a wait for this place.  I do miss their shrimp summer rolls that they used to have (what an amazing appetizer). The pizzas I have ordered include the Thai Chicken and Tostada. But I feel like the toppings always overpower the pizza too much.  And the pizzas are alright. They're not that out of this world.  Being in North Jersey, there are definitely better pizza dough and sauces out there. The pastas are good but very heavy and a little on the oily side. The desserts are huge and delicious though especially anything with chocolate. I love chocolate. The staff is usually prompt and courteous. I have never had an issue at this CPK specifically ever.   However, CPK just feels like a (slightly) higher end version of other chain restaurants (i.e., TGIF, Applebee's). The food is always way more than you need and usually just - it's alright. Not the best, not the worst and it definitely does the job to fill you up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=20
