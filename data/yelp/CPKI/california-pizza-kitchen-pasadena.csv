Kokoa T.,"Pasadena, CA",118,49,83,4.0,8/18/2017,"Let me start this by saying, I LOVE LOVE LOVE their chicken piccata. OMG! It's heaven on a plate. While on disability in August 2016, I ordered this through  . YESSSSSSSSSSSS!!! I think I posted it to Instagram about 4 different times in a two month period.  Fast forward to August 2017. While on staycation, a friend invited me to lunch so we could catch up. I chose CPK since I hadn't been inside the restaurant in a few years. We were greeted well and seated quick. Our waitress Kitty was such a sweetie. My friend brought her nine-year-old daughter and Kitty treated this child as if she knew her. It was too cute to watch their interaction.  My friend and her daughter both ordered pizza and salad. I went straight for my chicken piccata. OMG, it was just as good as when I have it delivered because I do still order it at least once a month. YESSS!! My friend couldn't finish her pizza due to the wonderful bread CPK gives every table. It filled her up quicker than expected. My friend's daughter, well Kitty brought her, her own bread basket and she ate it all by herself. She's a big bread-eater for some odd reason, lol.  When ordering the chicken piccata, I suggest extra cream sauce. There's a charge but it's worth it. The chicken piccata comes with three pieces of breast meat and sometimes the chicken can be a little dry, so the extra cream sauce helps. In this case, during this visit, such was NOT the case. The three pieces were moist and the extra cream sauce was perfect for the pasta. I like a wet pasta and the sauce has lemon in it. SCORE! Because I was on staycation, I ordered an alcoholic beverage. WOO HOO! I'm a Beyonce fan so to see a drink on the menu called ""Beehive,"" well, of COURSE, I had to try it. It's a sangria of sorts and while I like some sangrias, I'm more of a Moscato type of wine drinker. The beehive reminded me of a red wine so boohoo. The strawberries inside, once infused, were great! I should have stuck with their traditional sangria.  All in all, good visit. It was a little warm inside the restaurant but that could have been due to the alcohol. It does raise the blood pressure lol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena
Deanne R.,"Cypress, CA",22,90,73,5.0,8/13/2017,First time here at this location looks really cute. Excellent customer service especially the manager I regret I did not get her name. But my son with special needs ordered him self. The waiter brought what he had ordered but I guess in his mind it looked different...... right away the manager new he was not happy and asked what was the matter. My son described as best as he could the situation. She right way placed another other if pasta for him.  As soon as it came still my son was not content. I said it was ok. He would eat it after all the trouble I thought.... well the manager still was not happy she placed another order leaving the wrong one behind so my son could eat something while we where all eating. I was just amazed with the customer service.  I wished I lived close by to always come here!!! Thank u also much for everything.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena
Maria R.,"Pasadena, CA",18,269,,2.0,8/12/2017,"2 visits: one good and one bad (July/Aug 2017) Even the good visit started badly, with two rude little hostess chicks pretending they couldn't understand carefully enunciated English. Guess the speaker was too ""proper"" and not trashy-slang speaking enough for them. Once the manager took over and got us seated, dinner was fine. The bad visit never really happened. With a call-ahead (calling one hour in advance to get on the list is their version of a reservation), I still couldn't get seated. The host and hostess were bumbling and rude, respectively. I just walked. Don't waste your time calling ahead; it's a front. CPK corporate, if you're reading this, you have a serious problem with your host station in Pasadena. You have WAY too much competition in this city for your ""hosts"" to run business out of the door.

Aura C.,"Monterey Park, CA",509,463,11,4.0,11/29/2017,"Can't really complain. We each ordered a pizza and shared. We had the Thai Chicken, Garlic Pizza and BBQ. Nothing fancy, but good. Nice location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena

Sarah R.,"Tujunga, CA",0,10,2,3.0,1/5/2018,I've been to a few other California Pizza Kitchens before. I've never ordered anything other than pizza. This afternoon I decided to try their Kung Pao Spaghetti which was alright. I guess this is not a direct reflection of this specific CPK but their Kung Pao Spaghetti is definitely not worth the $17.51 that was paid. I would've been more satisfied going to Panda Express and getting a plate for under $8.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena
Jeff L.,"San Marino, CA",131,337,836,5.0,6/9/2017,"It was a great dining experience when I visited CPK.  We were warmly greeted once we entered and we were quickly asked if we parked underground and that they would take care of the validation so we could get that out of the way. The restaurant is bigger than it looks.  With the high ceilings and open floor plan, it's very bright and inviting inside.  There's also patio seating outside, and there's also an extra dining area to the right of the main area and that is where we were seated. Fred was our waiter and he was very on top of things.  He was refilling drinks once we were running low.  He brought us house bread which is still a classic after all these years.   I ordered the Thai chicken pizza.  It still tasted like how I remembered it.  I couldn't decide between that or the BBQ chicken pizza, both are great choices. CPK does have an app where you can earn points by how much you've spent, and I believe you can also pay for your bill through the app. Parking:  there's parking underground.  90 minutes free with validation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena
Beatriz A.,"Pasadena, CA",330,28,54,2.0,7/21/2017,"Luckily they have really good free bread here and I filled up on half a baguette, because the food was otherwise subpar.  I usually get the California Veggie pizza with no cheese. In the past, I've been told many times that this was vegan. Only recently, I saw an old Yelp review that said that the pizza crust at California Pizza Kitchen has eggs. Unfortunately, it's true. I confirmed it with the waitress. Seriously disappointed that I've been eating eggs this whole time, and none of the employees here were knowledgeable enough to tell me. What if this was a serious allergy? They really need to know their ingredients better.  I had to settle for the Dakota Smashed Pea + Barley soup and Super Spinach + Quinoa salad, which are both vegan. But be careful if you're allergic to dairy (or the ingredients in any of their other soups), because they warned me that all the soups are close together and can splash into one another. The price was pretty reasonable since it was from their lunch menu ($8.95 for a soup and salad lunch duo, valid Monday - Friday from 11 am - 4 pm). I was really hoping for something more substantial... The salad was very bland, and some pieces of the greens were just so bitter that I had to spit them out. The soup was just okay.  My boyfriend got the Shrimp Zucchini Scampi, which was also not great. It was mostly zucchini, with not much pasta or shrimp. And for a price of $15.99, the portion was just too small. My boyfriend eats an average amount, and he was still so hungry afterwards. He literally had to scavenge for the last bits of shrimp meat in the tails. And he even ate some of my leftover salad, which is saying a lot because he hates salad haha.  The added star is from the great service. Our waitress was so patient with my many questions and made sure to double check all the ingredients in their dishes. The validated parking was also convenient, since street parking is hard to find in this area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena
Jen R.,"Pasadena, CA",0,17,,1.0,12/29/2017,I don't even know where to begin with this meal.  We ordered dinner from here and this is what we ordered: 1. Kid's Mac and Cheese 2. BBQ Chicken Pizza on Crispy Thin Crust ($1.50 more for that) 3. Hawaiian Pizza on Crispy Thin Crust ($1.50 more for that) 4. Chicken Dumplings There was not a single thing here that we could eat.  The Mac and Cheese did not have ANY cheese sauce on it.  It was plain pasta with a tiny bit of broken sauce.  Both pizzas had SOGGY crust that was flimsy and not the slightest bit crispy at all. And don't forget that the pineapple on the Hawaiian pizza was not even cooked! The chicken dumplings were ICE COLD in the center like they had just been taken out of the refrigerator.  I understand that this is a chain restaurant and my expectations should not be that high but this is absurd and just completely unacceptable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena

Irene S.,"Hayward, CA",42,172,551,3.0,10/23/2017,"Came by here while staying next door at the Westin. Came by a lil less than hour before they closed. It was pretty quiet, maybe 2-3 tables had customers. Upon entering nobody really acknowledged us. They kept going about their business and then came to the door after. Kinda weird feeling. However, once we were seated we were greeted by our server (forgot her name). She was really nice and super helpful in helping us choose some options for meals. I ordered the mac and cheese and a side salad and my bf a cobb salad with chicken. Our food came by pretty fast. I was very underwhelmed with the salad. It lacked flavor and freshness. I can barely finish it. My mac and cheese was good until I noticed a whole bunch of black stringy things which at first looked like hairs in it. However, upon reporting it to our waitress she said the cooks told her it was residue from a sponge ....weird... but anyways she took it back and didnt charge us but at this point I couldnt even eat anything anymore. Kind of put a damper on my experience. However, my bf enjoyed his salad and I really did like the Cucumber Lime Cooler I had. So theres that lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena

Aura M.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",1026,321,2120,3.0,9/29/2017,"09/26/2017 UPDATE REVIEW:                                               What's wrong with your hosts?? No matter how good is your food, the first person to welcome you in the restaurant is the key to give your customers a good or bad impression. I went there on Tuesday night with a group of friends. Because i was the first one to arrive I requested a table for 6. The 2 hosts instead of welcoming to the restaurant WHICH IS A NORMAL THING YOU EXPECT FROM THE HOSTS they asked me to wait for them to finish their conversation. Are you kidding me???? I waited 5 minutes until they finally decided to give me a table. Maybe they don't need our business?? although the place was pretty empty. CPK should hire better workers otherwise they're going to lose business especially when there's a lot of places to go.                                        Then we had to look for our waitress to take our order, after 20 minutes since we sat down. Yeah, pathetic. PREVIOUS REVIEW: We were called the ""old peeps"" lol. And it's true since our last visit was 2 years ago. The menu has definitely have changed-for better. There are more food selection for those who are not that crazy about their pizza. Our waitress, Milo, was so nice. The GM came over to our table and introduced himself after placing on our table a cheesy flat bread as a complementary to our dinner which i think that was pretty cool-unexpected. Then he told us about all the latest changes in the menu like no more tiramisu :( etc. I don't know about you but that personal attention is always nice and really appreciated which makes me feel like coming back more frequently......also, the drink menu is also new. They added more cocktails and other refreshing drinks. The restaurant was cleaned. We got our ticket validated as soon as we stepped inside the restaurant. The food was good. The dessert was yummy too. It was a nice experience.....glad we went back!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena
Jennifer C.,"San Gabriel, CA",28,184,272,1.0,4/1/2017,"This review is for service only. I called in my order and decided to use the curb side service for the first time. The person taking my order was short with me from the start of my phone call and overall lacked finesse when answering some of my questions. And to bluntly state, I would not have needed to ask these questions if she was more informative to begin with.  Given this is my first time ordering curb side, I asked questions such as  where  I should park (park in parking structure or on the street?) I feel this is a valid question given it is Pasadena and there may be parking in the front for pick ups.  She responded with a tone that was short and really made me feel like this was an obvious fact that I should know. And to make matters worse, her response was vague and lacked detail.  When ordering with her, she misheard my meal and was snappy when I corrected her. What happened to good ol customer service?  Or in this case, common courtesy. Someone working in this position  (especially on the phone ) should have good social skills and communication skills - both are lacking.  I made a large order that day and was thankful it was takeout...I would not have been  able to bare spending an evening with her as my server.  *Although my rating does not reflect the food - just want to share that food was tasty, came out hot and the overall takeout process is great. Came with all necessary utensils and plates as well - just make sure you give them the correct number of people dining so they give you the appropriate amount.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena

Michelle L.,"Los Angeles, CA",244,120,152,2.0,11/24/2016,"I made the mistake of assuming CPK's revamped menu and modernized interior would translate to delicious food. Boy was I wrong. Well, at least I used a gift card! -Baked Potato Soup: Tasted as bad as it sounds (although my boyfriend thought it sounded appetizing). The soup was extremely thick, overly creamy, and had a strong cheese flavor. -Farmers Market Soup: The squash flavor of this soup was more appealing, but the layer of oil on top was not. Also, I found it to be more sweet than savory. -Roasted Veggie Salad: The vegetables had a good roast on them and the salad was perfectly dressed. Sadly, this was probably my favorite dish of the night. -Sicilian Thin Crust Pizza: The pizza was dry and needed more sauce while the cheese had an odd spongey consistency. The crust wasn't crispy enough. I could have built a much tastier pizza at Blaze for half the price! -Fresh Strawberry Mango Cooler: This drink tasted rather diet-y, as if artificial sweetener was used instead of the ""natural flavors of mango, guava, and ginger"" as described on the menu. Should have gone for the flavored lemonade! Tip to the business: Instead of updating your look, you need to update your recipes! I hadn't been to CPK in several years and I won't be returning for several more based on this disappointing experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena?start=20

Waitress walked by at least 4 times before taking our entree orders. Never were we offered any refills. Manager was focused on Television Basketball game rather than checking on tables or helping expo the food. Parties near us seemed unsatisfied as well. Pacing was horrible, food came out different times. My dish came out  a solid 5 minutes after my gfs. Our waitress seemed like she wanted to end her shift already, at some point she disappeared.

Kristin A.,"San Francisco, CA",0,21,32,2.0,6/22/2017,"I last visited this CPK on 5/20/2016 around 9 pm. Around 20 minutes after we got there, this large SPIDER (about 1.5 inches across) dropped from metal bars on the east side of the building ONTO my boyfriend. We promptly killed it, but since we don't like spiders, we were relatively traumatized. Our waitress, Jasmine (?), was very nice about it, and told us her manager was going to come over to talk to us.   After about 15 minutes of paranoia that another spider would again drop on us, the manager came over and asked in a relatively sarcastic way for us to explain what happened. We told her what happened, and she kept insisting that she had never seen a spider in the building - implying that because she had never seen one, we must have brought it ourselves. She then asked us if we had been in any ""dense forests"" that day. She was very rude given the circumstances and highly implied that we had brought in this spider as some sort of scheme.   Although our waitress was very nice and the restaurant ended up giving us a free dessert, the behavior of the manager was completely offensive. Seriously, spiders are icky, so WHY WOULD WE BRING IN A GIANT SPIDER TO THE RESTAURANT?    Other than the incident, the food was alright.

F. W.,"N HOLLYWOOD, CA",1,103,,2.0,9/28/2017,I am a fan of CPK but I would recommend the Studio City location or the Glendale location over the Pasadena location. I ordered Chicken Fettuccine. The chicken in the dish was chopped up in tiny pieces almost like carnitas and there wasn't much of it. Everything else was fine about the dish. The issue was with the service. I sat outside in the lovely patio on 9/24 and had to ask several times for water and the bread that was offered to me. It wasn't packed with people because I went off hour so I'm not sure what the issue was. The server would walk right past me to take drink orders and food orders from other tables after he said he would be right back with water and/or bread for me.

Not a fans of the Fresca flavored drinks but the Pasta dishes as well as the salmon were good.  In Pasadena a very nice alternative to The Cheesecake Factory.

Lauren P.,"Pasadena, CA",173,737,663,3.0,7/26/2016,"CPK, ummmm. . .  it is a chain and it is pretty obvious. This location has both valet for $8 and underground garage parking which is free for the first 90 minutes with validation.  The service was great. The serves were on top of their things and made the experience pleasant. The food is a -ok which is why I gave it a 3-star review. I feel like there is just nothing special about it, nothing that really calls to me that is. For instance, the cheesy Alfredo is just cheesy not lush or flavorful.  They do have a good drink selection which is nice but not the main point of going to a restaurant in my option. Good thing to note, it is fairly easy to have big group parties here if you're looking for a spot to host something of the sorts. For instance, my cousin had her 30th birthday party here which consisted of 30 or so people.

I had to ask them where I would be able to order, they just pointed, no hellos or how are yous. There wasn't many people so I don't understand why. They sure did stare at me though, it was uncomfortable. They have these girls working there with no manners. While ordering I asked the young woman working the register a question about the food portions and she rolled her eyes and proceeded to tell me that she didn't know the answer.

Chanele R.,"Spokane, WA",104,429,96,3.0,1/10/2017,"This was slightly worse than I expected from a chain, but not so terrible as to say it was a bad experience. We were seated at the end of the lunch rush, so that may have contributed to the incredibly slow service. After being seated for a moment, a male server came over to introduce himself and said he would be with us as soon as he gave the check to another table. He did this and then disappeared. Nearly 10 minutes later, a female server came over and introduced herself and said she would be with us after she took drinks to another table. After waiting almost 15 minutes, we were finally able to order. While the server acknowledged the slow service, I don't think she actually realized how long we had been waiting there. After that, the meal moved somewhat quickly enough, although there was an additional delay in getting our checks taken care of. The server was at least quick on refilling drinks, and the runner that brought our food brought it quickly.  As for the food itself, it was on par for CPK. I had the lunch combo of a California veggie pizza and the Farmer's Market soup. The soup was flavorful, although I could have done without the layer of oil that was added to the top of the soup. (This was not a separation issue - there was an actual layer of olive oil added on top of the soup in a swirl pattern.) Ironically, the bread appetizer that came with olive oil and herbs with red pepper flakes were really good. The pizza was good, not great, but good. Like I said, it was standard CPK chain food. My colleague seemed to really enjoy his food.

Besides the food and service, the place is outstanding gorgeous. There is also plenty of parking underneath. I would always come here because it's just so good. Booth seating in the back has a view to the side walk, street, and sky. The beautifully made menu makes it so easy to find what I want to have.

Kristen M.,"Isla Vista, CA",452,23,72,1.0,9/11/2016,"I convinced my parents to take us here last night because we had always come here when I was little and I remember it being my favorite restaurant. However, we left very disappointed that we had spent our money on such trashy, overpriced food. First of all, we weren't seated in the main dining area, even though there were so many empty tables. Instead, we were seated in the uglier part/ back of the restaurant next to other groups of Asians. Coincidence? I hope so, but this isn't the first time I've noticed this happening.  I ordered based on what I used to love, the spinach artichoke dip, and the Thai Chicken Pizza. Horrible, just horrible. The spinach artichoke dip came with really stale tortilla chips, and the dip itself wascold and seemed like it had been sitting in the microwave for some time. We asked our server for new chips, and he brought new ones for us which were less stale, but instead of replacing the stale chips with the new ones, he left the stale ones and brought the new ones on another plate. Why would we even eat the stale ones?? For the Thai chicken pizza was so bad for something that I remember being so good. The Brussel sprouts were raw and soggy all at the same time. The carrots tasted uncooked and it was just basically a raw salad on top of the pizza. There didn't even seem to be any cheese on it. We also ordered the mushroom pizza, which sounded amazing, and asked for the truffle oil for another $1.50. No truffle oil was on the pizza when we got it, so I complained and our waiter gave us some on the side. The chicken piccata pasta was extremely sour and lemony, and overall, everything else we ordered was disappointing and not even worth mentioning in this review.  All in all, a very disappointing experience and definitely not worth the $150 we spent here. Don't recommend this place at all.

Colleen M.,"Pasadena, CA",0,12,,1.0,6/22/2017,"I wish that I could give less than one star for this location.  I eat at the downtown LA location almost everyday as it is next door to where I work so I know what the food should look and taste like, which is consistently good there. First of all the Pasadena location should quit advertising and taking ""curbisde"" orders.  There is no possibility of picking up your food curbside because they have allowed the restaurant next door to set up their valet service and park valeted cars in every single short term space.  There isn't a single space open to allow you to pick up your food.  So this is just false advertising and makes the whole experience very stressful when it is meant to make it easier.  Pasadena loves to give tickets and pass regulations so I am going to make sure to report the valet's practices, but that is another matter. I ordered the Chicken Milanese which is supposed to be warm panko crusted chicken.  There was no panko and the chicken was cold and dry.  I also ordered the mushroom pasta which was fine.  Finally I ordered the Strawberry Shortcake described as ""piled high with seasonal strawberries, whipped cream and lemon zest"".  When I got home and opened it up what I have is a soggy biscuit, eleven tiny slices of strawberry (maybe the equivalent of 2 1/2 whole) and no whipped cream or lemon zest at all.

Jo S.,"North Hollywood, CA",221,688,3223,2.0,1/9/2016,"We had a very bizarre experience at this location over the holidays. We had family in town, we took them to several places in Pasadena and they wanted to have an early dinner here before boarding a plane. We stopped going to CPK for a few years (used to eat here a lot) after we had bad experiences at some other locations.  The menu is pretty much the same. Been there, done that! But this location is pretty and the area is beautiful so we thought it could work. Wrong! Once we got inside, we noticed that more than half of the restaurant was empty. It was just four of us, but the hostess told us it'd take 20 minutes to get a table. What's this bad trend lately that restaurants have when they're half empty and they tell you that you need to wait for a table? Is that some sort of mind game? Not cool! They seat us sooner, but not in the main area which was more lively. They took us to the right, put us at a table in front of the fountain drinks station where the waiters come and go. Not ideal! We got bread and olive oil, great change instead of the bread and butter they used to have. Our waitress was a cookie kinda gal, way too chatty. I wouldn't care if things 'd go well. We asked for water and each of us got a glass of wine. It took forever to get the wine. They bring it in small carafes now that they pour to you into glasses. Frankly, just pour it directly into a glass. It's a waste of glassware and time. I got a Pinot Noir and it was the worst red wine I've ever had (it makes $2 Chuck a major winner). But that wasn't the problem. Our waitress forgot to bring the water and she disappeared for a long time (she did mention she needed to go to the bathroom TIM!). We finally walked to another waiter to ask for water (our throats were dry from the bread and olive oil). Then, we got Managers coming to the table, apologizing, bringing extra bread, flatbread from the house. It's great and we appreciate that, but we didn't need extra food, just water on time. Getting water refills from our waitress was an on going issue. When we got our food, just 2 pizza-s showed up, one wasn't something any of us ordered. Once we got the food, it was just OK. The Sicilian was greasy, The California Club had too much lettuce on top, My Garlic chicken was just OK. The waitress wasn't around when you needed something, but she was around to keep asking us questions (like what we'll do for New Year's Eve?) and ask my husband if he was done when he was still eating, she did that several times. Yes, serving food is an art. We need to appreciate it when it's done right. Not here. They need major training. You need to bring customers things they need, be attentive, be around, but discreet. Don't keep interrupting conversations, be pleasant but not too chatty. Like I said, it's an art that's appreciated, but it needs to be more than mastered here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena?start=40

Maybe it was because CPK was the closest thing to a ""fancy"" meal we could have. Hehehe =) I received a few gift cards for the holidays so a Saturday lunch at CPK it is! Spicy Chipotle Chicken Quesadilla ($6ish): Small plate item. 4 one fourth pieces of quesadilla with a chipotle sauce on the side. If this was an entree item, I would get it! Perfect amount of cheese, beans, chicken and all that mixture in between two tortillas. Carnitas Habanero Pizza ($13.95): The thought process here was, it sounds interesting and unique = order it. Glad we gave it a shot. Luckily the habanero sauce is also ON THE SIDE or I wouldn't have touched even a slice! The sauce was a light pink color, somewhat 'mushy' and had a kick halfway through. If you don't like spice, stay far far away. The pizza was different in a good way. Pesto sauce with shredded carnitas. The pizza was small for a full. Full BBQ Chicken Salad ($14.95): I'm really not sure why a salad costs more than the pizzas on the menu... The portion was decently sized but not big enough to justify a $15 salad!! Your standard bbq chicken salad but with parsley I believe. The parsley threw it off a little. I would have preferred the salad without it. Prices are too steep for what you get but it's nice to come back once in a while.

Jonathan N.,"Pasadena, CA",2,26,,1.0,6/12/2017,"Hosts and to go workers are apathetic and mostly rude. It's very uncomfortable picking up food from here. I made eye contact with the baby faced host in the front, smiled, said ""thank you"" loud and clear, and he just smirked and turned his head. You get a clear understanding that the employees hate their job here. Update: I just waited for 20 minutes on an order that this restaurant allegedly didn't receive. Once again, all employees were rude and unhelpful.  Update #2: I'm still catching major attitudes from to-go workers. The whole system needs to be rebuilt. I'm also forced to package the food in bags, I'm not even an employee of the company. I'm contracted by the customer to pick up their food. Does CPK not package food to all of their customers? Why is it that food isn't packaged for third party delivery orders? We provided a TON of business for this franchise, and they treat us like we're in a soup kitchen. I'm still waiting on a call from upper management. Final Update: I spoke with the General Manager, and he disregarded my complaints on his poorly run restaurant. Due to the fact that I'm an independent contractor, he refused to create a solution. For the record, I used to take my wife and children to eat here, and my family has eaten at CPK for decades; unbeknownst to this abominable manager.

Their complimentary bread is really good too!  Chopped salad - Delicious chopped up salad with ground pepper and iceberg lettuce. So delicious. The flavor from the salami is really the best part of the salad because it's different from typical salads. You can get the full or half version.  California club pizza - It's basically a salad on top of a pizza but it's surprisingly good. I love the avocado on top and the bacon bits.  Jambalaya pasta - They give generous amounts of chicken and shrimp in the pasta. Really flavorful and delicious.  Chocolate souffle - Not the greatest here. It wasn't hot and moist as I wanted and the ice cream costed extra!  Service is always great here. The wait could be awhile during weekend dinners.  **$10 off $40 during October 2015!

When the bill came, I was a little disappointed. I had ordered two kids meals, which are each supposed to come with a drink. However, I was charged for one of the kid's drinks. I didn't want to make a big deal so I didn't say anything about it, which was my mistake. But when my change came back, the server only gave me back my change in bills, omitting my coins. No explanation. Nothing. Those coins and the charge for the kid's drink added up to about $2 now. Not that big a deal, but just the principle. Maybe because I didn't say anything about the drink charge the sethought they could gyp me on my coins now too? I don't know.  Big disappointment at this location so I won't be back again.

We promptly visited CPK a week later, to be met with pizza so disastrous we lost our appetites and sent it back. We visited again- even worse. Chicken tasted like rubber, lettuce was wilted. Extremely small handful of ingredients on a mostly dough-y pizza. The more we attended to give CPK a new chance, the more we discovered that CPK was worse, not better, than before.

Overall taste, meehh.  I understand CPK needs to expand their offerings to better compete with other restaurants. Although I completely understand, I believed they should not do it at the expense of what made them great in the first place - pizza!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena?start=100
Jenelle B.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",1176,806,712,5.0,12/1/2011,"EXCELLENT service. This has to be one of the friendliest CPK's I've ever experienced. The bartender made excellent suggestions for appetizers and drinks. (I got the Mango Mango Mojito and it was PUUUURE heaven to the throat!). As for the meal I got the California Club (I am not a big fan of whole pizza's I prefer them by the slice) which was super amazing. Deli cut turkey with bacon chunks, fresh avocado, lettuce and tomatoes all on a onion herb focaccia. The bartender/waiter gave me my caesar salad first which was pretty smart cus i never eat it when it actually comes with the meal. So touche sir touche.  I really enjoyed the location.

Very spacious and awesome customer service. As soon as you walk in you're greeted by someone. Lots of tables inside. Usually try to get a window seat. You can try to find street parking or they do have a structure you can park in. First 90 minutes are free. My favorite pizza item is their hand tossed chipotle pizza! Comes with corn, beans, cilantro, and salsa. Love that it comes with all these sauces. On days I feel like eating a little healthier I opt for their arugula & quinoa salad with asparagus, tomatoes, nuts, onions topped with vinaigrette dressing. My food is always ready promptly.

On to the food.  Three of us ordered the Chicken BBQ Pizza, Mediterranean appetizer plate and the Chinese Chicken Salad. 1.   CPK now has a new SMALLER PORTION menu all under $6.   The Mediterranean appetizer plate came with 4 pita breads, hummus and cucumber/red onion.  *  The hummus really wasn't anything special and tasted quite bland.  After spread the hummus on the pita and eating one, I had enough of it. 2.  BBQ Chicken Pizza had very dried chicken and the cheese looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp.  It looked like we got a previous canceled pizza order that had been sitting around for a while.  Not fresh and not impressed. 3.  The only thing I enjoyed was the Chinese chicken salad.  Hard to go wrong with salad when all you do is toss the lettuce, chicken and some vegetables with their special dressing.   Overall, my favorite CPK is in Burbank across the street from Ikea.  Pasadena location tasted similar to Glendale's location.  Just A-OK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena?start=140

Mary N.,"Jonesboro, AR",13,7,,4.0,6/4/2016,"We stayed at a hotel near here so we decided to walk and get dinner at CPK, having never been to one. The wait for a table was about 20 min, which was right with what they'd warned. We were seated outside, which would have been great had there been more lighting. I enjoy a darker, outdoor dining experience but I do like enough light to read my menu. A real candle, an ample amount of string lighting, anything that wouldn't have made it necessary for my family to all use their phones as lights, would have been preferable. Not sure if the lighting was hidden and just not turned on, or if it was actually meant to be that dark, but when the food arrived, we could barely make out what we were eating. The place stayed busy, almost too busy for the servers they have. Once we were seated, it was about ten minutes before anyone asked us our drink order. To be honest, we were contemplating heading to the steakhouse next door. All in all, I'm glad we didn't. Once they took our drink order, the ball got rolling. Our server Jamie (I think that was her name-she was from NYC)-was awesome. Very friendly, and even though she was busy, she kept refills and everything going. There was also a male server that looked as though he was staying running; he had originally taken our drink order and also helped serve the food. Very friendly and upbeat. Another lady brought us napkins and silverware and for a first time visit, a free appetizer! Some kind of cheesy flatbread that my husband and kids thoroughly enjoyed, if the fact that they wolfed it down says anything. I was concentrating on the avocado club egg rolls we had ordered. If you like bacon, these are for you! Very tasty, with just enough tomatoes and avocado and the dipping sauces go well with them. Let's see, around the table reviews, my husband liked the ribeye a lot but wished there was a mashed potato option (were southern) :). But it was cooked medium, just the way he liked it. My oldest enjoyed his garlic chicken and veggies and the avocado ranch sauce & my youngest liked his pepperoni pizza, although he didn't care for the amount of basil. There is quite a bit. I got a works pizza and it was good, it could have used a little more sauce and cheese, but there were ample veggies and the meats were huge. Overall, we would go back. It had an above average chain food taste (reminded me of Cheesecake Factory somewhat), but the people made it a great experience.

I got the Korean BBQ pizza. Was it the best pizza I have ever had, not by a long shot, but it was still very flavorful and good.  CPK is what it is and must be judged on that.

Thank goodness for heaters outside, and seats! We were much more willing to wait around for a table for the 8 of us thanks to the heaters and outdoor seating. Also, we were STARVING! CPK will not give you bread as an appetizer unless you request it, so if you're super hungry like we were, ASK! We ordered a lot of food. Good flavoring, oh, and I loved my honey wheat crust on my pizza. You can request it on yours as well if you would like. Yum! Loved our server, she was sweet, on top of her ish, game face on! They actually had to put two tables together to accommodate our party of 8 which randomly bloomed to 9, so it was a bit of a tight fit, but it was still alright. The bathroom was a little tiny, but I think that was because there were oh maybe 5 bazillion hungry Asians scattering out to the nearby streets scavenging for food due to the over flooding of the 626 night market event that happened. We dealed with it. It ended up being alright. Overall though, your average CPK. Nothing super memorable in either a positive or negative way.

Elton W.,"Los Angeles, CA",136,1058,86,1.0,12/25/2012,"Wine glasses placed on the table are rather presumptuous at a chain restaurant such as this.  As is the artificial five minute wait time, for which there is no apparent reason given plenty of seating and staff.  They'll offer you bread, but only serve it cold.  Nothing like some cold white sandwich bread.  Sadly, the butter (served with the bread) was probably the best part of our meal.  Gift cards placed on the table are also rather presumptuous. CPK's are staffed by people who are trained to verbally suggest specific upgrades, appetizers, and desserts.  Their actual feelings and emotions have been trained right out of them, or at least until the end of their shift. The spinach and asparagus spaghetti was completely void of flavor and was clearly lacking an ingredient. Saw the manager walking around a few times.  He seemed to hate his job.  I would too if I were a California Pizza Kitchen Manager. Fake pizza box art on the wall is stuff that only Thomas Kincaid could appreciate.  If he weren't dead.

The avocado spring rolls are a delicious starter. It's like a mini club sandwich in an egg roll. Hot. Seriously, it satisfies and whets your appetite. Okay, so this is the California PIZZA kitchen, so the specialty here is the pizzas. My favorite is the tostada pizza. I love Mexican food, and this is basically a burrito on a pizza. And I'm not generally a thin crust pizza, but I really like the crust. I suggest getting it with chicken though because otherwise it's kind of plain. Three non-pizza entrees that are yummy in the event you do not want pizza: the Kung pao spaghetti, the jambalaya, and the Waldorf salad. The first two are pasta dishes, both flavorful and spicy.

My associates got salmon and the tricolore pizza. Both were good - but not amazing - especially for their price. Their tortilla soup was delicious though - my favorite part of the meal. Servings were average-sized. CPK tries to make it seem as if their flavors are adventurous, but you're better off exploring at a smaller, mom-and-pop place.

There is plenty of inside dining and a sprinkling of outdoor seats for those that like to bask in the sun. I'm one of those and there was exactly 1 table left outside, but my colleagues preferred indoor, so I yielded to the seniors. One gripe about this place is the indoor table set up. There this nice spacious dining room set up in the front of a wide bar area, then there are the black sheep tables behind the bar that feel pretty isolated from the rest. Guess where they sat us? -=-Thai crunch salad-=- Pizza is good here and they have good customer service. You can't go wrong with the pizza, so I'm going to rate something that isn't so typical here. The Thai crunch salad was good for a light-ish lunch. The best part about that was the peanut dressing. The crunchy wonton strips could get a little carried away on top, but it makes it taste good, so it's hard to turn it away as unhealthy as it is. Chicken is pretty forgettable on this plate, because there was barely any of it.

The Santa Anita Mall never allowed us to split checks for parties over 4+, but the waitress today allowed us for a party of 16 people. Amazing! She made us all separate bills, that is one the amazing things ever cause usually other restaurants do not allow that. Not only the waitress was friendly about the checks, she offered help to cut the cake and other little things. The hostess was also wonderful, even though she was not our server, she had always updated which seating was better and easier to get. She suggested the patio seating because it would be quicker and our wait did not take longer than 15 minutes (on a Saturday night).  The patio was very cold! But they had two heaters for us, so it was really warm and it did not feel like we were freezing at all and outside was actually very calming and despite being outside, they often checked up on us regardless of refills or questions.

Davy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",178,21,26,1.0,7/22/2008,"It's funny how often one gets dragged into eating at chain restaurants to ""celebrate"" a friend's birthday. Eating at CPK is considered a sacrifice for me, as I do not like spending money on tasteless food plus slow service.  This particular CPK is also on the bottom of my list. When the bread came, it was cold and as hard as a brick. I had to stab it a few times before I could slice through in order to butter it. The butter was also hard to spread. You can tell a lot about a restaurant just by the bread they serve. I ordered the gorgonzola cheese and walnut salad (something like that, it wasn't worth remembering). It was just ""okay,"" definitely not worth the 13 bucks or however much it was. Again, I wasn't too surprised because it IS CPK. If you want a good pizza, go down on Fair Oaks towards South Pasadena to ""Mama's Pizza"" for some authentic New York-style pizza with FRESH toppings and for half the price.

Chetan C.,"Berkeley, CA",29,22,,4.0,9/1/2010,"Overall Restaurant Chain: CPK is typically my go-to restaurant when I want to go out to eat non-fast food with friends.  They have a number of dishes suitable for vegetarians, and in fact, they provide fairly detailed information on their website of dishes that are suitable for lacto-vegetarians, vegans, etc. (I love it when restaurants do this! It's great for customers and it  saves their customer service department from having to answer the same questions over and over).  My favorite dish is the Vegetarian with Japanese Eggplant Pizza.  It is slightly sweet, but has sundried tomatoes, which provide a tangy taste as well.  I always get one pizza for myself, but most people I go with usually end up having a slice or two left over to take home.  This Particular Restaurant Location:  This was a central location between where me and my friends live, which is why I decided to come to this particular restaurant.  Additionally, I had read on yelp that the restaurant was located by a nice fountain plaza with lots of outdoor art.  When I got to the restaurant, I must say, the plaza was quite underwhleming. To be fair, it was night and there were hardly any lights in the plaza, so if there was nicely decorated wall around it, they were hidden. You would think that at least the fountain would have decent lighting around it, but then you would be wrong.   It did, however, look like it would be a nice place to sit and relax during the day.   Right across the street from this restaurant are several other restaurants along with some high end stores.  It wasn't too busy when we were there, but it seems more like an afternoon hot spot. The Service: I had called ahead earlier in the day to make a reservation for me and two of my friends. I figured since it was apparently located next to such a nice plaza, it would be packed on a Saturday night. But I was told by the person on the phone that they don't take reservations far in advance, and she didn't think we would have any trouble getting seated quickly (after seeing the plaza at night, I can see why).  I was told I could call about an hour before I was planning on coming in and ask to be placed on the waitlist, which I did.  The place was fairly busy, but we only had to wait about 10 minutes before we were seated. While we were waiting outside the restaurant, one of the waitresses came out and offered us a sample of a new artichoke, spinach, and chicken pizza they had, which was nice.  My friends tried it and gave it a thumbs up.  The service was great throughout the night. The Food: There's not much to say here, it tasted as good as every other time I've had CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena?start=260
stephanie y.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",129,2,,4.0,8/4/2011,"Overall I would give the time there a 4/5. Right when we got there we waited about 5 minutes before the hostess asked us if we needed help. Once we told her that we needed to seat 20 people she said that it was no problem but the room that would be able to accommodate all of us would not be ready until a little after 6 and that the server that would be in charge of us would not start their shift until about 6PM as well. At about 5:30PM or so she came around and asked if any of us wanted drinks and promptly served us the waters and/or ice that we had asked.  We ended up getting seated at 6:04PM but after that we were left to rot in the 'sun room' until about 6:35 or so. The waitress started off with a bad first impression since she was taking drink orders while trying to put on the last of her uniform. She struggled to remember who had ordered which drink and the food took a while to come out but once she got those out of the way she started to pick up a rhythm. Our drinks were always full and she was happy to fix anything if we had a complaint: My chips were stale so she brought me new chips in about a minute. The waitress, Autumn, was very friendly and honest when asked a question and in the end I'm glad I had her as a server. The location of the CPK is a bit hard to find a first because it looks like a bank but it is on a street corner so it is easy to get to once you spot it. Most of the parking is street parking or public parking if you pay to park in the lot next to it. The inside is very nicely decorated even though you wouldn't know it was any bigger unless you walked around to see. The floors are a bit slippery but the bathrooms are very nice.

The prices are a little higher than you'd expect for pizza but it is gourmet, fresh, and so we were happy with our giftcard!  If you haven't tried it, it's definitely worth the try!  And Pasadena is a beautiful city, so you can eat your pizza and dessert and then walk around the city.  Oh and they Valet your parking ticket too! =)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena?start=180

There were a number of adorable babies around, and we saw one poor kid totally eat it on the concrete.  I went to CPK several times a year throughout my childhood, and I imagine that if I had kids I would visit CPK fairly often.  There are better dining options, of course, but if you just want an easy meal, CPK is a fine choice.  As far as chain restaurants go, it's definitely one of my favorites.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena?start=180

But after that it all went down hill. We waiting for about 45 to 50 mins before we got our dinner. We were pretty upset and not only that they burned my wife's pizza. The edges were black. We told the server and she even said it herself that it was not suppose to look that way. After complaining she replaced it but after waiting for almost an hour and having a burnt pizza at that my wife had lost her appetite. This place really sucked. We were not impressed and ayer waiting so long ir validation for parking had expired so we end up paying for that. One thing for sure my family is never coming back.

If you're on the  protein diet, you better go next door. This is CARB city. From my last count, I've been to 15 CPK including the one in Indonesia and Singapore. Honestly, the service is 1000% percent BETTER in those countries than the US. Service at CPK has always been average or below, don't know where they find these servers.

This time we decided to try CPK, so I went to the one in Pasadena to place a rather large catering order. Naturally, I had a few questions regarding the menu and the items I wanted to order. Usually wen we place catering orders, the manager or whoever is responsible to take your order is happy to answer any questions regarding the menu and the quantity needed for the number of guests you have etc. but at CPK the person in charge for taking the order, Michele, had no clue. With my first question she turned to another person working in the kitchen and requested the answer, that person referred to the menu I was holding in my hand which obviously  did not have the answer and hence was the reason I needed to ask the question. So with that question (about the number of sandwiches on each tray/platter) unanswered, I proceeded with another question about which sandwiches could be served cold and which ones had to be warm upon serving, at this point Michele said ""i have another customer I need to help"" and left me standing for so long that I chose to leave and place my order for 50 guests at a different restaurant that actually appreciated the business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena?start=180

The allure of the Paseo and Colorado Blvd overpowers the thought of actually walking one block north! However, for a quick and easy lunch, this is great option. I think restaurants can be judged by many criteria, however it all comes down to the bread and the iced tea! They have a great black iced tea (and the best part is they don't mind offering you an iced tea to go!) I, like many of you, I'm sure, are always trying to ""watch it""...right? Well, as much as I love the flavorful options, pizza, or dessert, I've found a few favorites that won't kick you off the wagon. 1) the tortilla soup--creamy, but not too much, 2) the quinoa and arugula salad (a must have! I loved it so much I've tried recreating it at home!), 3) the lettuce wraps are surprisingly good, 4) the chicken tinga quesadilla (get extra chipotle sauce, you'll thank me later!) Yum!

Michael P.,"Ross, CA",0,4,,1.0,3/25/2015,"I have been going to CPK ever since it began, and to many of it's locations, and have always ALWAYS been happy.  Not so this evening.  My family and I went there to celebrate my son's birthday like we have for many years because it has forever been his favorite, and not only did they mess up his simple cheese pizza, they did it in a insulting way.   They were headed to the table with a pepperoni pizza, saw the mistake, turned around and seconds later returned with a cheese pizza with basil to hide the pepperoni marks.  Unbelievable!  When I called them on it, they feigned ignorance and took it back... only to return with a new pizza... over 15 minutes later when the rest of us were almost finished.  And it was 5:30.  The place wasn't even busy yet.  Not until I called them on it did the manager begrudgingly comp the new pizza and then even more begrudgingly, boardering on hostiley, comp the entire dinner when she saw how disappointed and upset my family was at the bate and switch that they tried to pull.  She did not do it with class or graciousness, but rather with no real genuineness and never even returned  to see if there was anything else she could do. Rather she avoided eye contact for the next 20 minutes and so we left without having a birthday cake.  I realize that one simple family does not make or break a big business like CPK, but I was sad for the first time tonight at how many wonderful experiences over these many years was so tainted by such a dismissive way of dealing with us.  It felt like ""comp their dinner and get them the hell out of here"" was the attitude of this manager.   Well, they succeeded in that, I suppose, because we won't be returning to what used to be my son's favorite anf traditional place to have his birthday dinner.

I briefly read some of the other reviews, and apparently they all have the same consensus. It's pathetic that CPK doesn't take it's consumers/customers more seriously.   My mom and I ordered ""curbside"" service a few weeks ago - and comes to find out, THERE IS NOT CURBSIDE SERVICE AT THIS LOCATION!. . . The guy on the phone didn't confirm the order, and didn't tell me my total, and failed to tell me there was no designated curbside - it also DOES NOT state that there is no designated area on the website, fyi. We complained via online, and got a certificate for an entree and a drink (whoopie!), and a stupid letter apologizing for the service and stating that there is no designated parking - um. If they KNOW there is an issue w/this curbside stuff, why don't they let people know when they're calling in?  I went there last night to eat, and it was pretty busy. We didn't mind the wait since it was nice outside. . . I felt that the wait was comparable to anything else around - i.e. Cheesecake, Yardhouse, Villa Sorriso or PF Changs. . . The hostess seemed a little scattered, but pleasant. Forgivable since it was a little chaotic w/all the people, noise level and the amount of KIDS that were around.  Our server didn't mention her name, but she was genuinely nice, and was pretty on top of all her tables. Our drinks and food came pretty swiftly, but like I said, this is CPK, so it was up to expectations.   Other than that, it was pretty uneventful and normal.  *** FYI *** CPK validates for parking (an hour? hour and a half? . . .), the UNDERGROUND PARKING lot is on UNION. . . parking is definitely a hassle. Since they share the parking lot w/East West Bank, the Westin, and others, there is limited parking - even though there are three underground levels. There is also street parking, but it is metered. Make sure you read the signs for times allowed, etc. Pasadena is a stickler for giving out tickets (= $$!).  On a side note, this place is GREAT for kids. . . there seemed to be an over abundance of little people running around. If you want a place where the atmosphere doesn't care that you have your child, CPK is a good location.

Foods are decent, price is okay, our waiter was helpful and nice: 4 stars for all of these.

Ordered the pasta and a salad thru LA bite and specifically requested for special instructions to add extra sauce on pasta and extra dressing on the side. The pasta arrived extremely dry and salad had only 1 container of dressing, not extra as ordered. So I called CPK and spoke to the manager who initially said that they are not responsible because it was ordered thru LA Bite and the payment went thru them. She tried to put it on LA bites that they processed and forwarded the order. But when I asked if they received my specific instructions, the manager looked at the order, then said yes, they see my specific instructions. So I asked then why weren't the instructions followed. All she said was sorry and there's nothing more they can do. I would've appreciated her taking responsibility that they made the error right off the bat instead of trying to put it off to LA bites like they didn't forward CPK the question. But all she said was sorry and that I would need to come and pick up more salad dressing if I wanted more. I was very disappointed by the response especially because they made the error. I was very turned off that she did not even suggest to make up for the error.

David T.,"Alhambra, CA",355,296,140,1.0,10/17/2010,"Went here many years ago, and has never gone back. Over all food was very CPK, nothing unusual there, the issues was in the service. I went here with my wife (at that time gf) and a friend and his wife (they were married). We were going to do a dinner and movie things, and as our dinner ended, we notice that we had to get going as the movie was starting soon. We looked around and couldn't find our server (they might have been called waiters back then). So we asked another server to get our tab for us. Again, we were running late, so we were rushing the server (not our guy, cause we still hadn't seen him). We paid, left a tip and got up to leave, never seeing our server again. As we got to elevator, waiting for it to reach our floor, the server ran out and asked if he had provided us with bad service. Once again, we didn't think service was bad (very slow, but not bad), until the next thing happened. After we quickly explained our situation (all before the elevator arrived), he asked by the tip was so little? WTF! seriously!? Even with the slow service, we left a nice 15% tip...what more can you ask! Never going back to this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena?start=220

Debbie B.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",27,25,4,4.0,8/27/2013,"I have always liked CPK, as do my kids, but why did they stop serving butter with the bread?? Do they really think kids want to dip their bread in olive oil and herbs??  This  is a kid friendly/family restaurant, so bring back the butter CPK!  As for the olive oil, it needs balsamic vinegar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena?start=220
Tim S.,"Monrovia, CA",10,214,,3.0,8/23/2010,"I dislike CPK very much, it's an abomination .  Real Pizza does not taste like this at all.  I gave it three stars and not one because well, I'm not from here, I've never been into the California cuisine and suddenly I realize, it's not the restaurant I hate, it's the trickery in the name.  If you come here as an outsider, you'd think ""oh ok Pizza cool""  no not Pizza, California Pizza, it's not traditional NY style, it's not that greasy italian pizza that slides off with the gooey cheese and oils that make a pizza a pizza.   But I set my expectations too high.  I try to acclimate myself to the very different food here on the west coast, and have done well, (aside from cilantro)., but I just don't get CPK.  However, it is unfair for me to give a 1 or a 2 star rating simply because I'm an outsider, so I had to give it a 3 and say, I understand, but it's just not my thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena?start=220

Jeannette C.,"Pasadena, CA",2,14,,4.0,3/14/2012,The food is good just like at any other CPK. The location is very crowded but it is convniently located for me. The service has been great every time I have been there and I have been there many times. Even though it's very crowded I don't mind enough to stop going because everything else is great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena?start=220
Mike S.,"Pasadena, CA",0,2,1,3.0,11/17/2013,"Service is usually slow because this location gets really busy. They seem to need more servers. This location attracts a lot of families with young children too-- Maybe because of the large fountain out front. Overall the food is usually always good, the Caribbean sunset sangria is delicious and the servers are friendly. Parking is validated for 90 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena?start=220
