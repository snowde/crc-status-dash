Stacy M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",48,75,11,4.0,12/6/2015,"I'm not, by any means, an expert on pizza or Italian food, but I've always been pretty happy with the pizza at California Kitchen, regardless of location. But this review is for today, and today's experience has been the best so far. Todd is a friendly and gracious waiter. He stopped by our table enough, not to absent and not smothering. Very happy with him. The food portions are pretty large, the half-sized pear salad and the white pizza filled myself and my make companion, no room for dessert. Everything was tasty. We ordered a plain white pizza (not on the menu) to take home for a picky teen, and it came in time, but with a burn sport so they gave us an additonal pizza to take on the house! What service!  We plan to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2?start=20
Casey N.,"Pittsburgh, PA",114,116,126,3.0,11/24/2014,"I had always had this impression that they only served pizza, and nothing else. I was totally wrong! I recently moved by the Ross Park Mall so I decided to finally give them a shot. First time I had the meat cravers thin crust pizza. This was delicious! For some reason I just love salami on pizza. It goes so good with pepperoni, and this pizza has that! It was a very unique taste and look of the pizza and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I give that pizza 5 stars!! I would go back for more of the thin crust options, as I love a crispy thin pizza and not many places have that! Second time I was here was a little less appetizing. I ordered the original BBQ chicken chopped salad. The actual salad part with all the yummy veggies, cheese, and dressing was delicious and I would certainly get it again, but the ""chicken"" was completely gross. I don't really know what they did to it or where it came from but I honestly don't think it was fresh chicken breast, it was almost comparable to a subway quality chicken. Don't get me wrong, that type of chicken is fine, but for a $12-$14 salad, I would expect warm, freshly grilled chicken. This chicken was cold and just not appetizing. So word of advise, ask for fresh grilled chicken if that's what you really want on your salad! Service and atmosphere is good and it is a nice bright restaurant. Always very clean!  I am sure I will give them another try in the future, as that pizza was good, and I will remember to ask for the good chicken!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2?start=20
Steph K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",28,79,109,2.0,12/11/2015,"I have been here once, and once was enough.  Our server was friendly and attentive - no issues there as some others have had.  The food is....just not good. Sorry, CPK lovers, I dont get the obsession with this place. It is mediocre at best. I got a California club pizza, one of their ""signature"" items. It was a white pizza with some chicken and avocado on top. Underwhelming is an understatement. When it came to the table I instantly thought ""I just paid for this?"". Fiance got the ravioli - one giant bowl with about 6 pieces of pasta in it that he ate in about 15 minutes. We walked out the door with an almost $50.00 bill when the tip was all said and done. Totally overpriced for sub-par chain food. I would rather eat at the food court.  I will most likely never be back here unless I am forced in a group of people who want to eat here and I dont want to be rude and make a fuss. Otherwise, I think I'll steer clear.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2?start=20
Nancy C.,"GIBSONIA, PA",10,73,173,4.0,8/23/2015,"The food at this CPK is always delicious from their pizzas to pastas & salads. Today my mom & I shared the Tostada pizza, which was very good. I wouldn't recommend paying extra for the chicken because you barely get any & it's a little dry. My cousin had a delicious summer strawberry & watermelon salad that was fresh & refreshing. I also love the pesto cream pasta. Unfortunately, the service is a bit inconsistent at times. However, today we had a phenomenal server named Emily.  My mom & I waited about 15 minutes for my cousin to join us. Emily made sure we had enough to drink & even gave us bread to tied us over. My mom is very chatty & Emily was always willing to listen & has a great personality. You never had to beg for more drinks & she checked on us multiple times. She is definitely the best server we had here & most other places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2?start=20
Amanda B.,"East Pittsburgh, PA",42,80,320,5.0,5/19/2015,"I am not a fan of chain restaurants, but I love love love CPK! I first had their pizza in Hollywood and that started my obsession! This is the only location I know of in Pittsburgh, so we have visited a decent amount of times. I'm semi-ashamed to say (no I'm not) that I've only ever ordered the BLT pizza! I cannot stray from it! Sadly, they took it off of the menu, but they are still able to make it, thank goodness! I could truly eat it every week it's so good. Everything tastes fresh, not like it was frozen and full of preservatives. Whether it is or isn't, it at least doesn't taste like it!  As far as the restaurant itself, it has always been clean and the staff has been friendly. The most recent time we were there we had one of the most friendly servers I've ever experienced. He was extremely nice, helpful, and attentive. Thank you for making our dinner enjoyable!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2?start=20
Matthew U.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2086,1447,650,4.0,2/18/2014,"I know it's a chain, but man, did I have some good food here. For me, the only problem I ran into here was that when we entered the hostess was MIA.  Making us stand in a line for only about five minutes.  After that little hold up, it was smooth sailing. My friend and I opted to sit at the bar instead of taking up a table...good choice on our part.  Upon sitting down we were greeted by the bartender promptly, I believe his name was Brian (if I'm wrong, I apologize to you sir).  We were asked what we wanted to drink and given some menus.  While looking over the menus my friend and I decided to partake in an adult beverage.  I stayed with what I knew and had a beer, my friend had their berry sangria.  His words for the taste, ""It's like drinking Kool-Aid.""  After that we ordered an appetizer.  Opting for the sesame ginger chicken dumplings.  The mixture of flavors were very good.  The addition of scallions to a bite made the flavors pop even more. We were still debating on what pizza to get when our appetizer had arrived.  Upon asking the bartender what his thoughts were about ordering just one pizza and he said that with an appetizer, it should be enough; he was right.  We got the Sicilian, and my god was it good.  It was a mixture of meats, mozzarella, and a spicy marinara sauce.  I believe we had it made sitting at the bar too.  Once the pizza arrived the bartender said since we were sitting there, the pizza chef put a little extra toppings on there for us.  I mean, when you sit at the bar, you get to see all the food being made.  So thumbs up to you pizza chef (he had also said that making the Sicilian was one of his favorites to make).   Overall, the experience I had here will definitely warrant a return visit. Points to note: outdoor seating during warmer months, they take reservations (so call ahead if you know it will be busy), Entrances from both outside and inside the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2?start=20
Tony D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",336,666,564,4.0,6/29/2014,"A fancy pizza chain, as opposed to chains like Domino's or Pizza Hut, is not all that common, although CPK also has an impressive selection of drinks, salads and appetizers, and even pastas. From an overview of the other reviews, it seems that service here can be a give or take, but coming in on a Sunday afternoon revealed a pretty calm atmosphere and overall attentive service by our waiter.  From the start we were taken in, as the manager, upon finding out it was our first time there, offered us a flat bread on the house. They had several kinds, and the spinach and mushroom that we got was delicious. As for the pizza, we only tried the California Club this time, which was almost like a salad on top of the pie, and a very hearty one at that. Will definitely return for another pizza next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2?start=20
Amy S.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",6,84,,4.0,2/6/2016,"Stopped in for lunch today. We got the Thai Chicken spring roll appetizer, Hubby got some tortilla soup and we split a thin crust Margherita pizza. So good.  I thought the spring rolls were soooooooo good. That was a weird thing to have as an appetizer before getting a pizza.  But they do it right. The pizza was just a pizza - a good pizza by all means.  But the spring rolls were just so good, and the sauce that came with them was just heavenly. I really like Thai cuisine. Again, what a strange thing to say when reviewing a pizza place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2?start=20

Kimberly K.,"Baltimore, MD",251,143,70,4.0,5/7/2014,"I feel a little weird reviewing a chain, but I had some seriously awesome food here earlier today for lunch.  I came with a couple of friends, and we ordered a bunch of stuff to share.  Sharing is caring after all, ha! Anywho, we got a thin-crust wild mushroom pizza, the BBQ chicken chopped salad, and a $30 lunch special for two (one app:  spinach-artichoke dip, two entrees: the Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage pizza & the Original BBQ Chicken pizza, and a dessert:  Belgian Chocolate Souffle cake).   Everything was SO good.  The Wild Mushroom and BBQ Chicken pizzas were especially delicious.  I don't know how other CPK chains are, but the one in Ross Park Mall is legit.  If you're looking for a good meal after shoppin' up a storm, hit this place up.  This CPK is WAY better than the Cheesecake Factory next door.  Trust me, you'll thank me later!   Oh, and the service here was great!  Our waitress was super nice AND quick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2?start=20

Our waiter and the rest of the staff were very attentive and friendly, it's one of the best customer service experiences I've had at any restaurant.  We ordered two pizzas and one salad. Our food was quite good and the prices were reasonable. The menu seems quite varied and includes a lot of options other than pizza. I also noticed they had a couple craft beers on tap, which is always a good thing.

I believe that I've eaten at this location three times over the last several years. I've only ever had pizza here - Pear Gorgonzola, Hawaiian BBQ, and White Cheese. All three of these pizzas were delicious. I'm actually dreaming of the White Pizza right now!  Service has been OK. The wait time has never been quick, but I've also never become irritated by the wait... maybe 30 minutes or so.  Even though CPK isn't as exciting as a local, hole-in-the-wall type pizza place, they consistently deliver good food with descent service at a moderate price.

Asm A.,"San Diego, CA",8,33,24,1.0,1/17/2015,"What the heck happened to cpk's food and quality? I've had fond memories of delicious dinner dates at cpk, loving almost all of their entrées from pasta, pizza to salads. I had lunch there today after over a year. The husband got what he always loved here, the pear & gorgonzola pizza and I got the veggie grilled sandwich with tortilla soup and Mediterranean veggie rolls for appetizers. I have to say, the food was nearly inedible. The soup was a thick mushy blend of something that didn't sit right with me every time I took a bite, as if they put whatever leftovers they had and blended it. The sandwich was soggy. The med veggie rolls were just baked tortillas rolled up with cheese inside and served with marinara sauce from a jar, and the pear & gorgonzola pizza also didn't taste fresh. Needless to say, we will no longer be returning to cpk...ever!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2?start=20
Amelia H.,"Morgantown, WV",236,19,6,4.0,11/10/2013,"I have often eaten here many times after long days of shopping and I have never been disappointed. Recently ate here on a Friday night after some light shopping. The atmosphere is just great. It can be romantic, or good for catching up with friends and family. Good for every occasion! Although I didn't get a glass this time, I would like to say that their white sangria is AMAZING. It might be the best I've ever tasted! I crave it regularly! We were seated by a manager, who told us to grab him if we needed anything. He was friendly and professional. Normally, the servers here are super attentive and very professional, too. They are trained to pour in front of you, which is a nice touch. Our waiter this time was very Spanish, spoke a hundred miles a minute, and was very hard to understand. He was very nice though, but not completely attentive. He looked a little overwhelmed even though there weren't many tables in his section. I have had better service at this location before. I got a 5 cheese pizza and Tom got a California Club sandwich, which he loved. My pizza was good, as usual. Ate the whole thing! I also signed up for their rewards by getting the app on my phone. I got a free small plate (like a smaller appetizer) just for signing up!  I have heard that they are known for their butter cake dessert, but I prefer to go next door to the Cheesecake Factory and get a piece of cheesecake to go instead! :) Overall: Go check it out! And try the butter cake and let me know if it's better than cheesecake! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2?start=20

Tim W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2562,527,597,4.0,11/9/2010,"California Pizza Kitchen has finally arrived in Pittsburgh!  This location is in Ross Park Mall near The Cheesecake Factory, L.L. Bean and Crate & Barrel. It is a fairly small location so expect at least a 30 to 45 minute wait on weekends. There is also about 50 more seats outside for when the weather is nicer. You can always call ahead and get your food to go.  The service was pretty good given that the place was packed. I had the Korean BBQ Steak Tacos as a appetizer and my wife had the Wedge Salad. My tacos were delicious with just enough heat and kick. My only complaint was that the portion was small. (you get two) I could have easily downed two more. Our daughter had the Kids Cheeseburger Pizza and loved it!  My wife and I had the Meat Cravers Pizza which consisted of sausage, pepperoni, bacon, Capicola ham, salami, mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce. We got it on a honey wheat whole grain crust.  IT WAS EPIC! The pizzas are six cut which is plenty for two people. I had the Mango Iced Tea and my wife had the Mango Lemonade. They were both very tasty. The lemonade is extremely sweet so I would let it water down a bit before drinking it.  I'm really happy California Pizza Kitchen is here and will be going back often. I still have to try the Butter Cake and White Chocolate Strawberry Cheesecake. Hopefully we'll get more locations in the Pittsburgh area. Cough!, Monroeville!, Cough! Waterfront!

Quay M.,"Austin, TX",165,203,3,3.0,7/30/2012,"Out of all of the CPK that I have visited this one is definitely my favorite. The staff is friendly and the pizzas are usually pretty spot on. My favorite appetizers there are the Asparagus & Arugula Salad (so light yet so tasty!), White Corn Guacamole & Chips (super delicious!), Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings (seriously so good), and Lettuce Wraps. Sometimes I just order all four of those instead of a meal. Outside of those apps/small plates, I have only had a few of their pizzas: the Margherita and Roasted Garlic Chicken are the only two I remember lol (hey, it's been awhile!). The margherita has been great majority of the times that I have ordered it. The roasted garlic chicken did not sit well with me. The garlic taste was way overpowering because they have rather large pieces of cloves scattered throughout the pizza. Imo, I love garlic, but it should be kept to a minimum as the flavor is incredibly intense. Drinks-wise CPK does alright, nothing special. I wouldn't go just for drinks, I should say. There are a few places I would put ahead of them.

We started with a ""small craving"" wedge salad to share.  Yummy blue cheese dressing with bacon, chopped egg and fresh diced tomatoes.  We also got a Hawaiian Bar-be-que pizza with whole wheat crust to share.  I love their fresh pineapple, BBQ chicken, Gouda & mozzarella cheeses, yummy barbecue sauce, sliced red onions and cilantro.  The chicken on this pizza is so tender.  Love this pizza!  I wish I could make this crust at home!   We decided to share a red velvet cake for dessert.  The cake was amazing.  The cake is very moist and the vanilla bean cream cheese frosting is not too sweet.  It was served on vanilla bean sauce with a big scoop of Haagen-Dazs.  It's a little pricey, but SO worth it!  I love CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2?start=40

Yes, dessert.  Be sure to save room for the butter cake w/vanilla ice cream.  It melts in your mouth although the calories and fat content must be through the roof.  It's big enough that I'd recommending sharing rather than getting your own.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2?start=40

This is a good location and a welcome addition to the rather dried-up selection of places to eat in the north hills. The environment is welcoming and friendly. Typically we will each order a pizza of our own - don't expect a single to feed two. I can't think of a pizza that we've ordered that I didn't enjoy.

The tacos were good, kind of similar to the ones you can get from Houlihans, but not as good. For my dine in experience, my friend and I ordered an appetizer... she is kinda picky so we just got the Spinach Artichoke dip... I thought it was very plain, not very many chunks of actual artichoke (which made me sad). I ordered the White Pizza (my other choice would have been the one with artichokes... but since we ordered the dip I opted not to). Every other place I have ever had white pizza at has had tomatoes on it. So I was super disappointed when it arrived and there was none. I even asked because I really just assumed it was meant to be on there! Nope... they don't do that. Awkward. It lacked taste for that reason. I wouldn't order it again. (And I know its partly my fault, I should have read menu more thorough... but seriously... NO TOMATOES?) I'll go back, hopefully I'm happier next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2?start=40
Sisi G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1,45,1,1.0,11/25/2010,"If you like sweet crust, sweet sauce and cold pizza then this is the place for you! The crust was dry and so sweet that it could have passed for a mediocre cookie. And the sauce was sweet to the point of cloying. The cheese had already begun to congeal and harden by the time it came out. The wait staff dissapeared and were impossible to get a hold of. Its as if they knew we'd send it back if they made eye contact. The appetizers were pretty good but the portions were so paltry that they barely provided more than three bites. The description in the menu was that they were ""great for sharing"" Um.... no, methinks not.  Honestly this is the worst pizza I've had in years. I don't understand the hype, perhaps just the Pittsburgh Ross Park location is bad. But I know I won't waste my time or money there again. If you want good pizza pretty much any other place will give you a better meal and for a lot less.  My recommendation for amazing wood fired pizza (and far cheaper) is Piccolo Forno in Lawrenceville. I'm sure there are tons of great places in da burgh for Pizza. CPK is NOT one of them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2?start=40
Cj H.,"Beaver, PA",0,3,,1.0,10/14/2012,"Good food and service, but our family and another large party were still eating and the staff decided they wanted to go home so they started cleaning the floors with their bleach cleaning fluid while we were dining?!

Calista R.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,5,,1.0,1/6/2011,"We were dragged here by friends. The sweet crust (regular not honey wheat) and sweet sauce were nauseating. The appetizers were okay but so tiny that they were barely a couple bites each. It was expensive, the food was cold. It was one of the worst meals I've had in years. I honestly cannot believe that this chain has been successful, A Trib review claimed that this was a  taste of California. Putting California in your name doesn't make that come true. Perhaps we're not as cosmopolitan in Pittsburgh as our counterparts in the sunny West. But we're not complete rubes either. A taste of California would mean fresh, well prepared meals with fresh veggies and bright flavors. Garbage pizza with bottle barbeque sauce poured all over it and topped with cheese that makes government cheese look good isn't it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2?start=40
Lori B.,"Canonsburg, PA",8,179,453,4.0,11/12/2017,"Been a couple years since we've been to CPK. Knew they were having a free meal for Veterans Day so we took the opportunity to go. My husband was able to choose from 13 different items on a special Veterans Day menu. He went with the Hawaiian Pizza. Surprisingly (not!) he ate the whole thing. Said it was good. I never tried so I'm going to go with that! I was so looking forward to getting my favorite pizza of all time, the Pear and Gorgonzola. I almost cried when it wasn't on the menu!! Our waiter said it had been gone for a few months already. If the powers that be are reading this review I demand you bring that pizza back. PLEASE BRING BACK THE PEAR AND GORGONZOLA PIZZA!!!! I went with the spinach and roasted artichoke pizza instead. It was good, but not as good as the other one. It had a very, very thin and crispy crust and there was one piece of artichoke on each slice of the pizza. I would have preferred more, but that's what I got. That as well as the spinach was layered over a well thin spread of CPK's spinach artichoke dip which is one of their appetizers. I did like it though and wouldn't hesitate to reorder. For an app we went with the Avocado Club Egg Rolls. People, these are amazing. Every time I get them I think they couldn't be this good, but they are. I insist you try them. My husband is not really an avocado fan and even he thinks they are awesome!  The are stuffed with amazing goodness and deep fried in a crispy wonton. Dip these puppies in the ranchito sauce, a little bit spicy, and you have one of these best bites to go in your mouth. Love them so much!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2
Laura W.,"Washington, DC",249,1153,1745,4.0,7/1/2017,"After dining here multiple times since my previous review, and trying several of their non-pizza options, I feel I can say that this is one of my more preferred chain restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. Service has, at times, left something to be desired, but every food item I have had here has been tasty, especially for a chain. Consistency in food is something this particular location does well, which is always important.  Non-pizza items I have enjoyed: asparagus & arugula salad, bianco flatbread (ok, sort of pizza-y), chicken lettuce wraps, California fields salad (Fresh watermelon, strawberries and field greens with our housemade Champagne vinaigrette, Feta, basil and California pistachios), oven-roasted turkey and brie sandwich (Roasted turkey breast, warm Brie, shaved Bosc pears and baby greens with housemade honey-mustard), and the California club sandwich. I like the option of the lunch duo (half sandwich or small pizza and choice of a cup of soup or salad) as well. Definitely a solid choice for lunch while at the mall!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2
Fox E.,"Buffalo, NY",3672,4883,17415,2.0,3/7/2017,"A CPK is inferior to an EPK, which is an Electronic Press Kit for musicians. This ""Cali Pizza"" is a lot like a really bad EPK actually. You know EPKs can be cool but this one never will be. CPK is wickedly overpriced, for a start. It's popular in towns with sh** pizza like Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin and Seattle. That should tell you a lot. It's some of the less good pizza I've had. It's actually more like NY Style, but a bad version of it. It's overpriced, overrated, and a corporate national chain taking business away from the little local places, such as in this case, Fiori's and Aiello's. I don't get why people like it so much, but they do, so maybe you will too. All 3 of the people I ate it here in Pitt with, it was their first time trying it. It was not my first time.

My favorite meal here is the Grilled Veggie sandwich. It has grilled peppers, mushrooms, cheese & mixed greens with am AMAZING sun dried tomato aioli. I always get this with a side of tortilla soup. This is the only place I've found a vegetarian tortilla soup & it's so delicious.

Bernadette U.,"Pittsburgh, PA",66,104,104,4.0,2/8/2017,"Opted for California Pizza Kitchen as opposed to the food court at Ross Park Mall in the hopes of finding a respite from the shopping chaos. Then I remembered I have a 14-month old child in tow, there is no respite EVER. All kidding aside, they staff were very accommodating with us and our feisty toddler. Our waiter was also super sweet with our little girl. We made a lunch out of appetizers and ordered a plain cheese pizza off the kids menu for the baby.  I had flatbread with Brussels sprouts and bacon which was DELISH.  The crispy mac n' cheese was enjoyed by both adults and baby. AND the kids cheese pizza was very good, even if baby girl preferred her cheerios and milk, I enjoyed it. Would definitely go back next time we're at the mall and in the mood for table service. No lie, husband and I both got a beer, you can't get that kind of comfort at the food court!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2

Enjoyed the pizza with a good crust and had the Mediterranean salad.  Was not a fan of the salad because the dressing is a mustard herb vinaigrette that is just to mustardy, while I do enjoy mustard, the mustard overwhelmed any other taste of the salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2

We were greeted promptly by our server who was fantastic throughout the whole meal. Very courteous and attentive! I started with a small plate of Asparagus + Arugula Salad which was too good to be only 180 calories. I love anything that's healthy and delicious! The vinaigrette was great - sweet but not overpowering. The Shaved Mushroom + Spinach Flatbread was tasty but average quality, in my opinion. It was very crispy and the veggies were cooked well, but it was a bit oily.  Overall, I really enjoyed my meal; however, I would agree that their food is overpriced for the quantity and quality. Sure, it's not the best food you'll ever taste in your life but it sure hits the spot if you need a quick pizza fix.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2
Tina B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",132,323,607,3.0,6/8/2016,"Pizza is pretty good, but way too overpriced. And with all honesty, the restaurant also kind of smelled like an old dish rag. Came here on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all, but probably because we came in between lunch and dinner so I imagine we just missed the rush. We were seated by the entrance right by the host/hostess table and we could hear all the loud conversations of the recently out of school college kids who work there. Not ideal but you can't really blame them since it was a slow afternoon. My husband and I each got our own pizzas. I got the Hawaiian and he got The Works, each around $15. The size of the pizzas were pretty large, but not large enough to share between two people. If you were to share a pie, I would highly recommend also getting appetizers. But getting a pie to yourself will probably be enough with maybe a few slices to take home. My favorite part of the pizza was the crust, which was thin, but not too thin, and crispy yet slightly chewy. Otherwise, the flavor was kind of average. For $15 a pie, I was expecting a bit more than average.  I enjoyed the pizza but probably not enough to justify spending that much. However, it's a nice option when you've spent a long day shopping and need a sit down meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2
Emily L.,"Pittsburgh, PA",85,8,1,5.0,11/3/2016,"Went to CPK for lunch today and had a really positive experience. As someone with food sensitivities, I was thrilled with their attention to detail and extensive list of allergens across the menu. (Ask the server or manager for their special allergy menu or verified gluten free menu for more details if you want/need.)  I ended up having the soup and salad combo (Dakota Smashed Pea + Barley with the Spinach + Quinoa Power Salad) and not only was it delicious, it was the perfect portion size.

John W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",470,103,39,4.0,2/25/2017,"I love CPK and almost always have a great experience. Their menu has expanded and hey offer a range of craft cocktails as well.  Food: We ordered pepperoni pizza and chicken fettuccini. Both were good although the flavor of the fettuccini dish wasn't as light as it should have been.  Although it wasn't a cream sauce it came off as needlessly heavy. We wouldn't order that again.  Service: Initially was good until I received a refill that was a Diet Coke instead of regular. Then it took about 10 minutes to get my pizza boxed. But the worst part of the experience was paying for the check. Within minutes of initially sitting down I informed my waiter I would be using Mobile Pay, CPK's new feature where you can create a tab via the app and pay for your meal right from the table. He acknowledged it, I gave him the code to link to my tab in-app, and I thought we were set. Once we were finished, paid, then exited, he comes running out accusing (not asking) me of not paying. I told him I used the app, and he says, 'no, you didn't.' At this point I'm getting angry because 1) don't tell me what I didn't do. He may not have seen or been privy (even though he should have been), but he cannot attest to what I did. 2) I showed him the receipt in the app and all of a sudden it comes to him.

I would say that the food is a little bit on the heavier side though, especially the avocado spring rolls I got (which were good btw...but still really oily and heavy). But besides that, the pizza was delicious, a nice thin crust and really nice combination of toppings. I really liked the chicken bbq pizza because it had a nice blend of sweet and smoked flavor, along with good accessory toppings.

Sherry M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",37,223,992,4.0,5/23/2017,"Family of pizza lovers. We have met our daughter several times at this location, when she was working at the mall, during her lunch break. She no longer works at the mall so we don't have a change to visit as much as we used too.  This location has always been busy. I suggest getting there early and expect to wait in a short line, because they do not take reservations. For being here several times, I find nothing impressive nor disappointing, average experience at best. We order mostly pizza and salad. We do love the crispy Mac-Cheese appetizer. It was the first time we tried it and loved it, sadly every restaurant now offers it and makes it not a novelty any longer.  We have had the Pepperoni hand tossed pizza. We have ordered the ""Works"" as well; Italian Sausage, Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Mozzarella Cheese, Onion, Green Peppers, NO Olives. We have ordered the Mushroom, Peppers, Sausage. We have always had our pizza with a Field Green half Salad to split.  I love Key Lime Pie, I make it a mission to seek out the very best. I don't care for California Pizza Oven's pie. I can't speck of the Pasta, I have never tried it, other have said it was good but nothing special about it. I do agree with others post, it is a bit overpriced for what you receive. The food is good without a doubt, but not worth the price. We have used gift cards, which has helped to offset some of the price. The service is good and friendly and I have never had a bad experience. It does take forever to get a refill or a box or your check, we learned the first time to ask for the check as soon as they drop off the food, and remind them of a box when they bring back the bill. They do offer a mobile app which looks interesting, but I have no need for it, we don't visit often.

They do offer salads, desserts, and drinks but unless you are sharing expect to pay a bit more for your pizza. Sharing is permitted with no additional fee. On this visit my friend and I shared a vegetable topped pizza. Before you get it you are served 4 small breads with dipping sauce. They do not give you an extra plate for your pizza. While the food was average we usually end up taking the rest of it home. Service is good. They are located right inside the main entrance of Ross Park Mall. You can choose to eat indoor or outdoor. It is really not a place I would go out of my way for but have to be in the mood for it. They have WiFi but a very poor one to say the least.
