Danielle K.,"Omaha, NE",10,153,63,3.0,10/20/2017,"Its just ok. Been here before at other airports and I Always have the same opinion: just ok.  The margarita and untraditional pizzas are mt go to. I also feel like it's really expensive, even for airport food. $14 for a pizza? Its a bit much.  Especially when it isn't great. They have chips and other snacks available to purchase as well. Busy eating area, but it was pretty clean.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh-2
Shannon P.,"Columbus, OH",192,205,341,1.0,12/22/2017,"CPK sounded great since I've been plenty of times outside of the airport. The person working was extremely rude. She was staring off in the distance when I was wanting to order, and she seemed irritated that I wanted to order. I opted for the BBQ chicken pizza. The pizza was smaller and not of the quality of a normal CPK pizza... and for $14-$15 it wasn't worth it. There are usually 8 slices in a pizza.. It appears they forgot to slice across the last time. If I would've read reviews before going, I would've been happier. Go to CPK outside of an airport!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh-2
Doug W.,"Patchogue, NY",369,809,3184,2.0,1/16/2016,"Super limited menu, I think you get more for your money with the sandwich; the pizza seems smaller and crappier that a real CPK location and you're Gnna spend a California-fortune on it. Slow too",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh-2
David H.,"Scottsdale, AZ",291,186,2001,1.0,8/5/2016,This is the worst. Got a BBQ salad and it was $12 secretly the biggest scam in the game.  I got it to go and it was just awful a few pieces of chicken and then I had to mix it all together.  This is worth about $3 worth of a salad total including labor. Not sure if it would have even mattered if I had it and stayed there.  This is not a representation of CPK and needs to be fixed.  Not worth the price and not worth the taste. No bag was offered service was eh and I'm just another fool who got scammed by airport food but what do you expect.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh-2
John S.,"Woodstock, GA",56,663,257,2.0,4/29/2016,Very limited menu. The pizza is $14 and change that's insane! I still got the pizza.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh-2
Anthony C.,"La Quinta, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/31/2017,Very bad food. Turkey club was very dry. I've taste better chicken tortilla soup out of a can.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh-2
Matt G.,"Morrisville, NC",36,632,,3.0,2/21/2016,"This is a decent option for a quick meal at the airport, but as you already know, if you're going to be eating at the airport you're going to be screwed. As Seinfeld says; do these people know what the prices are anywhere else in the world?!? I had the plain margarita and it cost 14 dollars (can't remember how many inches) and 3 dollars for a regular size bottle of water, Mama mia, Papa Pia - the prices! The pizza tasted better than expected. The size was just right for lunch for one person. You order at the counter, the pizza was brought out to my table. Not super clean on the tables or floors. For sure, this is better though than the burger place across.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh-2
Karimah B.,"Durham, NC",116,173,118,2.0,7/21/2015,"Toppings were not spread evenly and there were very little of them to speak of. At least the pizza tasted good. But it still took a full 30 minutes for them to bake a pizza. It's not like it's a full size version of the place, so I don't understand what the problem is. Especially since customers have to pay upwards of $15 for a 6-inch pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh-2
Robert G.,"Cary, NC",0,44,,1.0,7/26/2016,I had the bbq chicken salad.  It had to be the worst $13 salad I've ever had.   Unfortunately it was pre-made and already had the cold bbq chicken on it.  Do yourself a favor and eat anywhere else.  I will next time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh-2
Benjamin Q.,"Bensalem, PA",1,51,93,1.0,7/20/2016,"RDU-Airport, I cant believe I had to tell the server to change her plastic gloves before she prepared my food  the same plastic gloves she had just finished picking up the trash with and sweeping the floor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh-2
Inez N.,"Bakersfield, CA",136,204,94,4.0,8/13/2015,"For a fast food pizza place at an airport, this was damn good. They have a very limited selection compared to the full restaurants, only serve personal sized pizzas, and it is a little overpriced. This hit the spot!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh-2
Sohini R.,"Providence, RI",71,227,11,3.0,11/14/2014,"Pricey at almost 14 dollars for a personal sized pizza, but this CPK saved me a few days ago.  After flying to RDU with a crushing headache, I stumbled towards the glow of CPK by C8.  I devoured a personal BBQ chicken pizza and it was delicious; a very good duplicate of how the pizza would taste at a sit-down CPK.  This is probably the best option at RDU, although I would stay away from the salads (which I didn't try, but they didn't look so good on other's plates).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh-2
Cody B.,"Manhattan, NY",217,88,52,1.0,5/27/2014,Whoa! I paid $12 for a Cobb salad because I thought it would be better than the generic $8.50 ones scattered throughout the rest of the airport. Boy was I wrong. This thing was horrible! If I am ever coming through here again I will definitely be skipping this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh-2
Joshua R.,"San Fernando, CA",95,10,2,1.0,11/30/2014,"Do not expect your order to be correct. Do not expect good service. Expect to be treated like you are going to pizza hut, except do expect to pay for a horrible experience where employees lack responsibily and maturity but only represents how shitty a chain can be, especially under shit management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh-2
H P.,"Quincy, MA",0,72,79,2.0,6/9/2014,"Nice tasty piazza near gate c8, but costly and small. Good service , 2 star because costly and not enough to eat for 2 people on  costly pizza. -HP",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh-2
Will P.,"Mount Laurel, NJ",0,15,,1.0,3/17/2016,"You can't expect much at the airport but even by those standards this place is fairly awful. The salad I ordered had pale white iceberg lettuce, stale tortilla chips and the ranch dressing the lettuce was soaked in May have turned. Perhaps the worst meal I have ever had at an airport",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh-2
Jodi B.,"Los Angeles, CA",128,1,,1.0,11/30/2014,Bad service! This guy literally tried to blame me for his mistake. Got the wrong pizza. AND had to wait forever for it. This place is the worst.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh-2
