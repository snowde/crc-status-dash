Sevann H.,"Springfield, IL",262,549,1938,4.0,12/10/2017,"It's been years since I've been to a CPK. I just couldn't pass up the opportunity. Despite it being a busy Saturday before Christmas, we were seated right away.  Our waitress was fantastic, she was fast, attentive and efficient. The warm bread she brought to the table was baked to perfection. We started with the buffalo cauliflower. Basically baked cauliflower coated with a spicy buffalo sauce, blue cheese and green onions. It was actually amazing. My BBQ chicken salad was huge (full size), I splurged and added avocado which was a nice addition. It also included jicama, which is hard to come by at most restaurants. All in all was a great salad, although pricey coming in at just under $20. But can you really put a price on a good salad?!? My husband ordered the shrimp and garlic pizza. The crust is their signature thin crust pizza. It was good, but was a little dry and suffered from too much cheese (yes, you can have too much cheese).  We had a great meal and were in and out in less than an hour, so overall a great experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond-heights
April G.,"Florissant, MO",90,19,3,2.0,11/12/2017,"We walked up to the hostess..desk? Pulpit? And watched as several employees buzzed around looking at a schedule while we stood in silence, hoping to be honored with acknowledgement. After several minutes a woman looked up and stared expectedly, as if daring me to speak first.  ""Two?"", she finally asked. ""Yes."" I said smiling. And then with no further instruction we stood there for another five minutes while her and the other employees planned their heist to break into the Capitol to steal the Declaration of Independence. Or rather, discuss further the table situation, with exasperated looks on all their faces as if two human beings weren't standing before them. A different woman eventually sat us, and as I looked around I noticed stacks of dirty dishes sitting on the condiment table behind us. They were there the WHOLE time. So many employees walked by. Yet the dishes remained... We were brought our appetizer and give two plates, both dirty. One with an actual piece of food the size of my palm smashed on to it. Perhaps bread? Maybe not. We told our server who responded, ""UGH."" As if to show disgust without concern. We quickly ate our clearly frozen prepared appetizer and politely paid the bill and ran out the door, never to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond-heights
Max H.,"Saint Louis, MO",446,12,42,1.0,7/31/2017,"Very disappointed.  It was my sisters birthday, and our family gathered for what was supposed to be a nice dinner. It took almost 10 minutes for anyone to come to our table to get our drinks. Or even say ""I'll be right with you"" she just looked at us. Meanwhile, she is standing and talking to another table.  That was the first thing that put me off. Jacky was her name. Before she brings out drinks, she greets another table and brings their drinks and bread. We get our drinks, no bread. We had to ASK for it.  Another 10-15 minutes goes by, doesn't offer appetizers, and we had to flag her to get our order. I was very pressed for time, and didn't appreciate being made to wait 25 minutes just to get bread and something to drink.  I was able to put in my order with appetizers, and she did bring out my meal first. However, I had to ask for a box THREE times, between the second and third, she boxed up ANOTHER TABLES food (the one that got their after us, and she clearly felt deserved more attention) My sister, finally said something. As well as a few of the people I was with. It was just embarrassing that we recommended this place, and she had to talk to the Waitress Jacky not once, but THREE TIMES!  It's VERY rare that I don't tip. I OVER tip because I've been a server and been there! But there was ZERO excuse for the way she treated us-they weren't busy, it's a Monday night.  When we spoke to a manager, she simply made excuses for the server.  I am very unhappy about my experience here today, and not sure if I will return. It's a shame because I Loooooove the Jambalaya! I would rather drive to Chesterfield than have to deal with service this poor again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond-heights

Randy V.,"Saint Louis, MO",16,87,125,4.0,6/26/2017,"I've been eating at this CPK (ie California Pizza Kitchen)location for years.... and typically they do a really good job! CPK has made some menu improvements in the last few years and a few blunders! First the positives: While It may be called California PIZZA Kitchen do Not be confused, While CPK has some tasty Pizzas (Which I always considered non traditional wood fired pizzas with very different ingredients) *Their Salads and Pastas are top notch! The Chinese Chicken salad,and The *Seasonal Strawberry Fields salad (See Pic!)  Pasta: CPKs  1.)Fettuccine (Your choice of protein) =Nice garlic cream sauce. One of the best Fettuccines around! 2.) Kung Pow Spaghetti (a personal fave!)  chicken, green onions,cayenne in a flavorful peanut sauce (I personally have them hold the actual peanut topping) .... You may be apprehensive to try this the first time but IMO it is amazing and waitress said they sell a Lot of it! Secret to the Pasta Dishes?= Perfectly al dente pasta!! CPK gets points for adding new and diverse menu items over the past few years.  Bread w Olive Oil w spices is ok Missteps: = Mainly in desert dept: (eg they HAD one of the better Tiamasu deserts=Gone and Flourless Chocolate soufflé while still here, used to be fresh and now tastes prefab microwaved!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond-heights
Christy A.,"Saint Louis, MO",4673,1279,11749,4.0,3/26/2017,"Sana was a great server; very friendly, accommodating and prompt. Our pizzas were delicious and arrived just as we'd ordered. Hand tossed BBQ Chicken original with bacon and a Cali. Veggie with goat cheese. The Brussels & Bacon flatbread was another hit amongst my dining partners.  CPK also has a kids menu which doubles as a coloring book, equipped with 3 crayons to occupy the kiddos while the adults converse.  Plenty of dining both indoors and out, a full bar, herb garden display upon entry and hosts stationed to greet you at arrival.

Charlene M.,"Chicago, IL",25,89,123,3.0,2/3/2017,"I went there with a friend who was shopping at Galleria Mall just to grab a drink and something to snack. California Pizza Kitchen does not offer a happy hour, although they have a pretty large selection of cocktails ($9.99). I had a Moscow Mule (pretty classic right?), I thought it was too sweet. My friend had a ginger strawberry cocktail, too sweet as well.  We ordered a plate of 3 Tortilla Spring Rolls. I thought the spring rolls, the waitress described us bigger portion but it was way smaller. You have the choice to mix different rolls, so we ordered one of each : Mediterranean Veggie (mushrooms, eggplant, sun-dried tomatoes, caramelized onions, Mozzarella and Parmesan and marinara sauce on the side), Baja Chicken (with Monterey Jack cheese,  Cheddar, corn, black beans, poblanos, red onions and cilantro, with housemade guacamole on the side) and Thai Chicken (with Peanut sauce, bean sprouts, scallions, carrots, cilantro and Mozzarella and Peanut sauce on the side). Those rolls were tasty, I liked the Thai chicken one the most. I may try their pizza next time if I'm around.  The service was awesome though, Steph was very sweet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond-heights
Caprice F.,"Saint Louis, MO",115,426,1314,4.0,4/4/2017,"Dinner at the bar last Monday evening was splendid. I had my usual, the Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage pizza with a strawberry iced tea. It was all delicious. Athough at times during my meal, I wanted something and the bartender (my server) had disappeared, the service still wasn't bad. There were also large TVs throughout the bar and dining room which nice to watch while dining. Getting back to the service though, I inquired about CPK's reward program. I handed the Bartender my filled out card to get me started and he mis-entered my phone number into the system when setting my account up. Teh way that you're found in teh system is by phone number so as of now, when I'm asked for my phone number, they won't be able to find me in the system. Thanks a lot sir..... He apologized and said that I'd have to change it online, and that he's not able to change it in the system.

Alex N.,"Saint Louis, MO",185,32,9,4.0,4/24/2017,"Ordered pepperoni pizza which was really tasty. For a chain restaurant this place impresses. I ordered ahead and the food was prepared in the time that was given to me, which is always a plus. Downside, is their curbside service to go. When you pull up to the parking spot, you have to call a number. Debatable if it is an actual St. Louis number. When I called, the person on the other line seemed confused. I waited for a few minutes and no one came out. I finally had to go in to retrieve my order. I was in a hurry, which is why I thought he curbside would have been convenient. It's not the worst thing in the world, but just put a small dent in my plans since I was really on the go. Great place though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond-heights

We decided to do the half and half (I think they called it the duo).  We each got half of a salad (me a Caesar, him a super spinach + quinoa).  We both decided on the oven roasted turkey with brie sandwich.  Both our salads were good but each of us agreed that we could have used just a bit more dressing.  The sandwich was delicious but I agreed with our waitress who said she thought it would be better if it had cranberry chutney on it.  All in all, it was a good lunch and fueled us for the rest of our day.

Beth G.,"St. Louis, MO",0,3,,4.0,11/11/2017,"I am giving this 4 star review based solely on the polite hostess and the good food.  However, the service seriously sucked.  We were a party of 3....Mother-in-Law, Daughter-in-Law(Me) and my 26year old daughter.  We are all well versed in restaurant etiquette and were not greeted with the same from our waiter. The first time he arrived at our table he wanted to take our food order.  I politely told him that we were not ready but we would like to order our beverages at which point he rolled his eyes!  We never were offered refills on our drinks until we flagged him down.  When I requested more bread and oil for my Mother-in-Law to accompany her salad he acted annoyed.  When he brought it he slammed it down on the edge of our table and didn't even take the empty plate!  My 89 year old MIL was so upset.  We got the message loud and clear from him that he was not happy to be waiting on a group of women....well we always tip 20 percent and after he got his tip and we were done eating and just chatting he could not have been nicer....refilling water and ice tea!!!!!  We spent a lot of money to be disrespected by this twerp!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond-heights

Service is great - everybody is very friendly and wants to make sure you are enjoying your meal. All the pizzas are 11 inches so I split one with my boyfriend and we got an appetizer as well. The appetizer we got was buffalo cauliflower something... it could have been chicken, the texture was great! The sauce is spicy but not too spicy and the bleu cheese really complimented it. I was skeptical about the cauliflower but now I'm going to try more cauliflower as a substitute type foods. And obviously the pizza was very good, crispy and flavorful. And to top it off we got a coupon for free dessert and little candies from the manager since it was our first time.

Bryan S.,"Saint Louis, MO",72,68,32,4.0,4/12/2015,"Well aware this is a chain, however this is my first time eating here. I'm sure any of these reviews could apply to any cpk in the Unites States. Our waiter surprised me with a little snack of chips and special Guacamole dip as a first time customer. Our food was fresh. I got the BBQ chicken salad, which I liked. I hate when salads are bland and have no nutrition to them. This salad was loaded with greens, tomatoes and avocados. Tried my wife's pizza. Yummy. All four of us dining together split the strawberry shortcake and oh my gosh it was incredible. A biscuit split in half a la mode with fresh berries. We devoured it.  Each entree I would say is large enough for two people and the desert was plenty for four of us. Seems like serving sizes keep getting bigger and bigger these days.  Awesome place.

Sandi C.,"St Charles, MO",28,147,602,3.0,4/16/2013,"I just realized this place had a renovation. The place seemed bigger with kind of a rural pastoral design.  Friends and I decided to come here to have dinner on a early Friday evening. Place wasn't very crowded, we were here around 6pm.  We didn't order pizza this time, I think we've tried all the pizza on the menu already. We decided to go with pastas.  They now offer complimentary bread with olive oil and herbs. Bread could be warmer, it was crusty outside and soft inside, loved the olive oil.  I ordered the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine - I really liked the hint of jalapenos lime sauce, not really spicy. Skimpy on the chicken.  Kung Pao Spaghetti with Chicken - took a bite from my friend's plate, didn't really like it.  Jambalaya Fettuccine with Chicken, Shrimp, Crawfish, Sausage and Ham - I am not a big fan of cajun sauce, can't comment on this one.

Stacey T.,"Saint Louis, MO",243,288,115,3.0,3/30/2013,"While interviewing with a restaurant owner, he admitted that this chain was his favorite in St. Louis. I found that really, really hard to believe. I mean, there are some really great restaurants in St. Louis... Or, at least, so I hear.  Anyways, once said owner planted this seed in my head, I couldn't get pizza out of my head. I was taking part in some retail therapy and suggested we check out the ""fresh"" ingredients he told me about. The staff was friendly, really friendly. From the hostess, who basically let us pick our own table, to the honest and knowledgeable server, who took excellent care of us. Everyone was sunshine, puppy dogs and rainbows.  My date had two mini-appetizers, one was a dip of some sort (shows how memorable it was...) and the other was quesadillas. Neither were worth whatever she paid for them. Admittedly, the guacamole was fresh and chunky but the portion was really, really small. Smaller than tapas small. The quesadilla was just a joke. It was extra skinny and sad.... I, on the other hand, was hungry. I ordered a small starter salad. It was really great- loaded with candied nuts and the dressing was perfect. I also ordered a pizza to share. It was the special of the day (week? month?)... brussel sprouts, goat cheese and bacon! It sounded weird, but was, indeed tasty. The downfalls were that the bottom of my pizza was blackened, not burnt, but charred with way too many grill marks. I get it. A wood-fired pizza oven, or whatever, but I still don't need the taste of char to over power my entire pizza. What a disappointment. Furthermore, the pizza combination itself would have been far more balanced with a nice layer of olive oil (since there was no marinara), as goat cheese alone is very dry. I was inspired by the experience and intend to recreate the salad and the pizza at home.  All in all, customer service, however attentive and nice, is not enough to make me spend my hard earned cash. Three stars for trying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond-heights?start=20

I highly recommend their Sangria - both their red and white - both are delicious and come with a lot of tasty fruit to snack on as well.

Patt C.,"Chesterfield, MO",245,945,,4.0,2/4/2012,"The office ordered in for a working lunch yesterday. We used 569 Dine, which works based on the ZIP code of your delivery destination. The website shows all ZIP codes served, including the restaurants participating in delivery to each ZIP code. There is a $10 food minimum and a $5.50 delivery charge. If your order is more than $30, they automatically add a 10% gratuity. We were ordering for 5. Everybody thoroughly enjoyed their food. There was Sedona Tortilla Soup (and the tortilla strips were courteously in a separate container), Korean barbeque steak tacos, asparagus and spinach spaghettini (whole wheat) and Margherita pizza. I got the Wedge Salad. And tortilla spring rolls, two for $7.29. You could get 3 for $10.29. This is listed as an appetizer, so I thought a salad to go with it would work well. Tortilla spring rolls: I chose the Baja Chicken (diced chicken, Jack and Cheddar cheeses, black beans, mild chilies, red onions and cilantro with guac on the side) and the Mediterranean (grilled Portobello, eggplant, sun-dried tomatoes, caramelized onions, Fontina, Mozzarella and Parmesan with sun-dried tomato marinara on the side). The flour tortillas were all herbed up. Delicious and crunchy (even through the packing and delivery time). Two spring rolls. How much food can that be? It was six or eight three-bite pieces. Huge.

Tom T.,"Saint Louis, MO",3,174,,5.0,4/22/2013,"I love, love, love their pizza!!  I have for many years!! I call them designer pizzas and as much as I like a traditional pie I really love CPK pizza.  I have never had a bad pizza here and I even order extra pizzas and take them home to eat all week long. A must for a good lunch!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond-heights?start=20
Aspin K.,"Columbia, IL",571,201,8,4.0,2/28/2014,"I have always been a CPK fan-- for many years now.. I dont make it there often...at all.... but I do love it when I go. Yesterday my gf and I went there for lunch for a late birthday celebration-  and honestly--- everything about it was good, from the service, to the food, to the dessert--- why are people so hard on chain restaurants??  If its good, its good---- and i mean, i know, if its bad , its bad--- i get it. but, I had a pleasurable experience--- and while I WILL say that $6 for a draft blue moon (a big one) is a TAD high IMO, the service was prompt, quick, attentive, and the ingredients on my pizza were indeed  fresh, and yummy!  I always stick to the pizza I have loved for many years, and that is the  Thai Chicken Pizza....SO GOOD!! :)  And it more than satisfied my craving for CPK-- So CPK I commend  you on giving me a good experience---  My beer was cold, my pizza was hot, and the dessert was scrumptious!  My gf ordered the tiramisu, and while I am not a huge sweet eater, I thought it was really good.... and I am by no means a tiramisu expert---  So people, cut the chains a break wouldya!?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond-heights?start=40
Elizabeth W.,"Saint Louis, MO",19,10,,3.0,10/19/2014,"I love coming to CPK, but only for the appetizers like dips, soups, and salads. I've always thought this company was misnamed. With all the outstanding cities known for having excellent pizza (New York, Chicago, St. Louis, etc.) why on earth would California try to compete with this? It only hurts their business. Nobody ever travels to California to try their pizza and there is a reason for this: people go to California to eat healthy, tasty, hippy dippy food! That's what California is known and loved for! So why not capitalize on this? The apps and entrees  at CPK are some of the best anywhere! I say the company should be renamed CTK: California Tapas Kitchen!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond-heights?start=40
Mike C.,"Middletown, CT",9,188,4,5.0,7/3/2014,"Today, I've decided to give them another chance and had lunch there.  Because the district manager replied to my prior negative review about not getting breads.  They request another chance.   The service was excellent, and without asking they gave us breads.  The waiter was very attentive.  Two thumbs up.  Keep up the good work!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond-heights?start=40
Mona H.,"Redwood City, CA",51,151,174,2.0,5/19/2012,"I didn't come here with Mallory W with the idea they would have superb pizza. I already know cpk is pretty generic, so I can't expect too much. I did expect good service, but we didn't even get that.  It felt like our waiter was seriously on his first day there because he was clumsy, and forgetful, among other things. He brought out my appetizer salad with my meal, which I hate! I should never have to ask someone when my appetizer is coming out, but these days I feel like I'm being forced to because of epically bad service everywhere. Anyway, our food was as expected, good, but not orgasmic. The kicker of it all was when he brought our checks and I couldn't find my credit card. Our waiter disappeared into thin air, so I was left to find it on my own.  I found out he dropped it by the register.  That was the last straw. He got a terrible tip from us both and I will most likely never return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond-heights?start=40

Cricket A.,"Saint Louis, MO",279,207,21,4.0,5/17/2011,"SO WHAT IF ITS A CHAIN. DELICIOUS. I kinda play it safe here. I don't really venture out of what I know I like. I'm afraid it won't be good. Their salads just look like something from Applebees, and I never have good luck with Applebees, so even though they sound good I never get it. Point taken away for the bread they bring out. Cold sourdough. Come on, at least be warm? But at least they bring you bread, I guess. I always order the Wild Mushroom Pizza. It is so delicious. Packed with tender wild mushrooms and that sweet crispy crust is to die for. My fingers, I lick them clean. Also, their flavored lemonades...free refills! Win! She kept bringing them out when I was halfway done with a glass, and at first I was annoyed because the last one she brought out I wasn't even going to touch, but then she offered a to-go cup for it. Awesomeeee. I'm a sucker for good service - our waitress was attentive even though she was very busy, and the manager visited our table. Cool points. CPK, I like you.

They were at least 20 minutes late with the estimated order they gave us. And then when we left we found out that they missed one pizza completely and didn't give it to us. Upon returning back we got told that they gave us everything and only upon insisting that one was missing the bothered to check the drawer by the kitchen. And there was our pizza.

Cintharella F.,"Saint Louis, MO",42,19,8,4.0,4/27/2013,"I love how to get to the restaurant i have to pass the pretzel place because it smells so good and it makes me more hungry.  it was busy lunch hour so we had to wait 15 minutes and there was no more bench space outside.  the waiter was very friendly and she got us our water right away even though there were a lot of people. we got some bread and olive oil and i really like the decoration; they have an oversized lantern big enough to fit 20 obese tinkerbells.  Anyway, we ordered the waldorf CHICKEN salad and the hawaiian bbq chicken pizza. i liked how the waiter asked us if we wanted the salad first or everything together-- they're supposed to ask but i think they always forget. Everything was amazingg except for the fact that they forgot to put chicken in the chicken salad lol lol... we let the waiter know and the manager came over and very kindly offered his apologies and let us have the salad for free, which despite being chicken-less, was still very, very tasty and i would definitely recommend it! the pizza was delicious and we asked for ranch, i think they charge 50 cents for that. all in all, we had a great experience!  i am also pleased that the hawaiian pizza is a chicken pizza since anything with pineapple or named hawaiian usually comes with ham.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond-heights?start=40
Anita K.,"Saint Louis, MO",43,164,,2.0,1/15/2013,"The changes here over the years have not been for the better.  The decor is industrial and cold.  The tables look as though they tried to shove as many seats in as possible.  It was so haphazard, we had to walk a circuitous route in several directions just to get to our table.  They have wine glasses that they leave on the table for the duration of the meal- lunch in this case.  Don't think CPK is that type of place, especially for lunch.  It took ten minutes for a waiter to say hello, another ten for our beers and to place our order, and another forty five for the pizza to arrive.  When it did, I had to get the bill and a couple of boxes so we could make it to the movie we wanted to see at the Galleria Cinema, luckily just right down the hall.  All this and it wasn't very crowded.   The menu has changed as well- the prices are higher, many of their bests salads and dressings are gone.  They also try to upsell every pizza.  I asked if the Habanero Carnitas had cheese on it...it doesn't but they can add some for a charge.  Hmmm...not really going to pay for cheese on my pizza, something I consider a standard ingredient even on a gourmet pizza.  So I asked for the traditional BBQ chicken and was asked if I wanted to add bacon.  Ummm, no thanks, again!  Bacon, although delicious, doesn't even sound that great on a BBQ chicken pizza.  And that's saying something!   I wound up having to sneak my pizza in to the movie since they don't want outside food in the theaters.  Obviously by this point I was starving but was not going to buy something else when I had a whole pizza!  Luckily it wasn't too hard to sneak in and it was easy to eat watching the movie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond-heights?start=40

Margaret C.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,4,,4.0,1/2/2015,"Started off 2015 with lunch at CPK. The new lunch duos menu shows originality as well as some fallback options for the gastronomically challenged. The offerings are affordable and give a wide range of choices: soup and salad; soup or salad and sandwich; soup or salad and 7 inch pizza. We had the super spinach + Quinoa salad features tender spinach, cranberries, crisp Granny Smith apples and spiced pecans. It's a nice balance of flavors and textures that's more interesting than a run of the mill salad. A guest had the Caesar topped with a generous amount of shaved Parmesan. Both salads came with warm sour dough bread and olive oil infused with spices.  I ordered the 7 inch sausage pepperoni mushroom pizza and a guest ordered CPK's signature BBQ chicken pizza. The pizza crust is impressive - thick, tender but firm, and both pizzas were topped with lots of cheese. The server, Katrina, added even more freshly-grated Parmesan. Yum.  It helps too that Katrina, was lovely and accommodating. Portions are munificent so plan for leftovers, if you're not a big eater.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond-heights?start=40

I usually get the classic BBQ Chicken pizza, but when I'm feeling adventurous, I'll get the Thai pizza. Both are big favorites of mine. I've also had the 5-Cheese and tomato pizza and the Sausage pizza. I guess it really just depends on my mood what I want to eat. The bread they serve before the meal is decent. There's really nothing special about it.  The wait staff is usually pretty friendly, but I've definitely had a few waitresses who did not meet my expectations.

Okay... that wasn't so hard.  I just need to shut out the snobby part of my brain and come to grips with the fact that I really love their chicken Waldorf salad with dijon balsamic vinaigrette.  I love their mango tandoori pizza.  I love their broccoli and sun-dried tomato fusilli. Wait a minute... according to their website, it would seem that they've gotten rid of their mango tandoori pizza. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
