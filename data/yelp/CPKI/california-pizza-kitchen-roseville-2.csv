Tricia F.,"Sacramento, CA",138,353,1078,4.0,4/3/2015,"Located in Fountains of Roseville shopping area ~ which we love! They have a large outdoor seating area. Although it took awhile to receive our food, our waitress was very nice and the food was great. What's not to love about CPK, right?! Our pizza was a little burnt on one side, but honestly, I think it was because the crust was a tad thin in that area. I always enjoy the Quinoa and Arugula Salad! Delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=40

Micki M.,"Sacramento, CA",422,617,5209,3.0,4/25/2013,"Girlfriend and I dined here with our girls. Girls day out shopping at the Fountains, I had never dined here before and thought it would be a great choice.  We ordered the cedar plank salmon, spaghetti bolognese, chicken fettuccine, and Chinese chicken salad. My girl ordered the Chinese chicken salad and thought that the cilantro was an unwelcome addition to the dish, she thought it was too overwhelming. My girlfriend loved her salmon and I loved my spaghetti bolognese.  No complaints from her daughter on her fettuccine. The spinach artichoke dip appetizer was like any other places'.   Overall, it's a nice inviting atmosphere, great place for a romantic date, I say this because both my girlfriend and her daughter are very soft spoken. I wish this place well since there is so much competition in this little shopping and dining mecca!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=40
Paul G.,"Rocklin, CA",6,134,5,5.0,8/10/2016,"CPK is probably my family's favorite restaurant.  The food  and service is almost always excellent.  Our favorites are the tostada pizza on the original crust and the kung pao spaghetti.  My son, who is a picky eater and loves fried chicken from every other restaurant, actually orders and enjoys the kid's meal with grilled chicken strips and broccoli here.  My daughter likes the mac 'n cheese (we always have to ask for extra cheese because otherwise it is too dry).  If you have kids, here's a tip:  the kid's meal desserts are big enough to share with the whole family.  The brownie with ice cream is $1.69 and is delicious, not to mention probably 1000 calories. Another tip: their bread is very good, but ask for ranch and Cholula with it.  That combo makes the bread even better. Downsides are that a few servers are not very good, but it's been my observation that they usually don't last very long at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=40

If you ventured way off of this and where disappointed then I guess you get what you get. I personally like their variations on the normal kinds of pizzas. The lady and I really like the pear and Gorgonzola pizza which has fresh arugula and greens.   Here is a huge bonus this place has the big bottles of Downtown Brown and ice ice cold glasses!

May A.,"Roseville, CA",719,940,14068,3.0,7/22/2013,"Good experience My first time in this location. My co-workers came here because we thought there was happy hour but we were wrong. That's okay, the food I ordered made up for it. I had the Garlic Cream Fettuccine w/ chicken. Yummy roasted garlic Parmesan cream sauce w/ added chicken (extra $3) or if you prefer shrimp (extra $4) or both (extra $6.50). This meal was $10.75 by itself.  So it was a little pricey for me but was surprisingly delicious and I enjoyed every bite.  Location is nice but lots of competition as there is an abundance of fine food establishments here at The Fountains. Plenty of parking but it gets full. Service was good. We were seated immediately.

Every time I come here everything I have ordered on the menu has always been delightful and good. This location is also really clean and the staff are very friendly here too.  Things to try- Sangrias! New salad on the menu strawberry fields salad, the works pizza and the quinoa arugula salad!!  Not so excited about- the pepperoni pizza. Yes I know how can you make a pepperoni pizza not so great? Well this particular item wasn't really calling my name out, and it was just very bland..

Jaime H.,"Roseville, CA",6,18,2,2.0,3/3/2016,"I am giving two stars because I have always enjoyed the food at the California Pizza Kitchen. But would only give one star for the service we just received tonight. We were seated in a section where the waiter had a hard time prioritizing. We sat there for 20 minutes with no drinks, no bread, no nothing. He finally asked us if we wanted something to drink, but ended up giving drinks and taking the order of a table that was seated almost 30 minutes after we got there. And we still did not have our drinks. We finally got up and walked out. 35 minutes wasted time. We came over to Cheesecake Factory and we're  much happier.

Sounds like laziness to me... I had to tell her to ask her manager I didn't get an apology or any thing. A lot of attitude. I also asked for butter with my bread I had to ask about 4 times before I actually got it. I also had to wait way too long for a refill. I've never had this kind of service here.

Nickolas H.,"Dixon, CA",3,11,25,5.0,10/11/2014,Best pizza kitchen ever.    So this is the second time I have been to a California Pizza Kitchen and I can say this is where a person should go if they never had pizza before.    I don't really like getting pizza out that often because at my school they sell pizza from Pizza Hut. This place is awesome. Everything is awesome about the place.     Customer Service is really good. Really friendly and when my father asked for a bigger chair outside they were happy to give it to him.    Pizza is the bomb. Each member of my family got a personal pizza. There are about 6 pieces in a personal and that could have fed 2 members of my family it was so big. Taste is really good and you can tell the food was fresh.

Noelle C.,"Reno, NV",16,16,18,5.0,3/16/2015,I love to come here whenever I'm on the prowl for the perfect salad. Once again: CPK never fails. I had a delicious peach salad today and added grilled shrimp (so yummy). It was the perfect combination of sweet and savory and left me feeling filled up but without the guilt!

Jennifer E.,"Antelope, CA",0,19,,4.0,9/11/2016,"So impressed by them! So it was one of my friends birthdays yesterday and we were going to go over the Yardhouse but the wait there was hour to hour and half because it was a group of 10 and as much as I understand that it was a kinda large group that is still a pretty ridiculous wait. So we started calling around to other places in the parking lot and when we called CPK they told us that we could come over and get seated right away. So we walked over and got seated the waiter took our orders pretty fast was very helpful in the process of ordering with all our questions. I ordered the Pesto Cream Penne with Chicken and it was Delicious. Usually I'm not a fan of penne pastas but this was soooo good. Honestly going to CPK was such a better choice i think anyways because my friend loves pizza and they were so quick about everything. I would give them 5 stars but two of my friends had to ask about their pizzas that they ordered and the waiter went to check and when he came back he said that they had just started making them. My friends told them don't worry about it and just take it off the bill, they didn't want them anymore. They weren't mad about it or anything thankfully and we all still had a pleasant and fun experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=80
Christopher D.,"Fair Oaks, CA",1,49,1,4.0,3/8/2015,"This is the newer of the Sacramento Pizza Kitchens. The menu has an assortment of pizzas with the barbecue chicken a lunch and dinner favorite. But if your calorie counting go for any of their salads... Full of flavor and probably serving size wise more than enough to fill you up. My son went for the individual size pepperoni pizza which looked like an ad on television. He liked the thickness of the pepperoni, the sweet tomato sauce and the cheesy cheese topping. I went for the barbecue chicken pizza but added the bacon which i regret as the smokey flavored pork overpowered the barbecue sauce. All in all...

Daniela N.,"Sacramento, CA",409,232,135,3.0,11/13/2013,"My boyfriend and I were about to start a day of Christmas shopping, but I desperately needed food first. I found out that he had never had CPK before, so we headed here because I thought that it was kind of crazy he had never had it. I love the Arden location and used to go a lot with my mom whenever we went shopping together, but this location was not that great.  Started with some soda and water, very exciting. The waitress brought new soda as soon as we were about half done, which was nice but made me consume more soda than I normally would, ha.. Then got some bread, which was decent. I started with the chips and corn guac, and my boyfriend had mac and cheese. The guacamole was good, but because of all the fillings it was creamy and really hard to get on the chip. First world problem? The mac and cheese was like in little baked balls, no idea how to explain it. He liked it. I can't even remember what we topped our pizza with, so obviously it wasn't that exciting. It was just decent.  Service was good, though bordering on overbearing.

I don't really have any complaints about the place or their food.  I like their pizzas; they have a pretty big selection. I don't have a ""favorite"" when it comes to their pizza, but I know I enjoyed the teriyaki chicken pizza. I also like their pasta; it tastes like pasta. Their jambalaya is actually really good; the spiciness is perfect (but wouldn't hurt to add a little more spice only cause I love spicy) and just the right amount of sausages, shrimps, and chicken in it.  The ambiance in here is very relaxing and it's a good place to take your other half; it just has that vibe (at night time).

The host sat us at a table and left--no menus or silverware in sight.  We tracked down a server a few minutes later and she seemed annoyed about fetching us what we needed. Another server showed up and took our order but didn't really seem to care. She just looked bored. Whenever we needed anything she was nowhere to be found.

I'm normally 100% against eating at pizza places due to the almost unavoidable risk of cross-contamination, but after hearing about their changes, I wanted to try it. So, after talking with the staff, I learned that you can order any of their pizzas on a gluten free crust, but that the only ones they can guarantee are absolutely gluten free (prepared in a separate area, cooked in a separate space, etc) are the ones listen on the gluten free menu. (I think there were 4 available.) The pizza was pretty decent (I had the BBQ Chicken) and I didn't get sick, but it wasn't the greatest thing in the world.

The issue I had was the salad.  Personally I love salad, but there is something about arugula that really doesn't sit well with me.  It just isn't pleasant to eat.  When Celia came around to see how we were doing, my wife let her know that I wasn't really liking the arugula salad.  She was very kind enough to switch the salad out with a house salad.  I'm also not into blue cheese of any kind, whether it be dressing or butter.  My steak had blue cheese butter and she was kind enough to switch that out with regular butter.  If she wasn't so understanding I would've had a very bad experience and the rating would've likely not been good.  And the best thing of all was that butter cake with coffee!  Oh my goodness, it's so good.  That was a 10 for me.   If you have an opportunity to dine there, I hope your server is Celia.  She'll take great care of you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=20

Jennifer S.,"Sacramento, CA",3358,493,984,3.0,2/25/2016,"We had the barbecue Hawaiian chicken pizza with bacon. The crust was quite bland and boring. It was honestly a bit on the small side for $17, and there were hardly any toppings on it. I mean there were maybe three pineapple bits on the whole thing. Still, it was enough that I wouldn't have been able to finish it by myself. I had the smaller half and was uncomfortably full, but I'm sure most guys would be able to polish it off pretty easily. I registered for their rewards program on my phone, so we got a free appetizer, and chose the corn guacamole and chips. It was really good, and it was pretty small, but the waitress had warned us that it was as small as it looked in the picture. It was probably like four tablespoons of guacamole and a large handful of corn tortilla chips for what would have been $5 (if it weren't free). The waitress was attentive and helpful. The food came out in a pretty reasonable amount of time, and we didn't have to wait to be seated. Based on this one pizza, I might have gone with two stars, but I've been here in the past many times and have always really liked their California Club pizza (which has avocado and bacon on it) and their avocado egg rolls. If memory serves, they also make a really good lemon drop. The tiramisu is good but not traditional. It's more like layers of vanilla cake and rum cake soaked in rum, with the whole thing covered with a rum mousse. We didn't seem to get any ladyfingers or espresso in ours, but it was still delicious.  Overall, I have enjoyed coming here, but the pizza is just not that great, and for the price, I think I can do better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=20

I tried making it at home once. I had all the ingredients. It tasted okay. I kind of felt like I was being polite to myself, though. It wasn't the best thing ever, but I didn't want to hurt my feelings.  So the next week, I found myself drawn back into my local CPK to get my fix. That's the best damn salad EVER. My foodie friend could not get her head around my love for this salad and made fun of me for being such a regular at a chain restaurant. Well, guess what? They opened a CPK in her Chicago suburb and her wonderful husband insisted they go, so she took my recommendation and ordered the BBQ Chopped Chicken Salad, and now she adores it, too.

The hostess was totally over the top trying to get us seated. She quote a time and when she saw that the party they were waiting wasn't moving, she brought a manager in on it. They bent over backwards to get us a table. To be honest they were more upset the time it took to get us a table than we were. We figured a Saturday party of 8 would take 30-45 minutes.

I augmented the salad with some cheese I had and more lettuce.The most horrible cobb salad EVER!

Karen G.,"Turlock, CA",307,612,7,4.0,1/25/2010,"CPK is a good choice when you cannot decide what to eat. They offer a little bit of something for everyone. I mean, who doesn't like pizza? They offer a pizza for just about everyone from pizza experimenters to old school pizza lovers.  My usual is the Margherita pizza. How can you go wrong with melty mozzarella, fresh tomatoes and fresh basil? Upon my most recent excursion I decided to try something new. I perused the salad section of the menu and found two that sounded tasty...the grilled vegetable salad and the Thai crunch salad. When our server returned I asked for her recommendation between the two. She recommended the Thai crunch salad hands down. Sold!  The verdict? Absolutely delicious. The salad had edamame, crunchy rice sticks and wontons, crisp lettuce and peanuts. The dressing had a most wonderful peanutty flavor. Scrumptious. I'm so glad that I ordered the half portion though. There was more than enough salad for me to enjoy.  All in all, CPK is a good solid choice for a quick and tasty bite to eat.

Shannon G.,"Fair Oaks, CA",34,199,1,5.0,3/16/2010,"I avoid the chains.  I like giving my business to locally owned independents. I love CPK.  We patronize the Roseville location frequently.  We love sitting at the bar to eat.  Watching the employees prepare the pizza, and seeing the activity throughout the kitchen area, is a pleasure.  Have you ever wondered, or worried, about what goes on behind the scenes?  Here there is no mystery - they are confident enough to let you see it all. The Cream of Asparagus soup, dairy free, is out of this world.  I'd order it on the hottest day of the year.  The CPK Cobb is my favorite salad - beets on request, quality salad dressings to choose from, and the half portion is MORE than enough! We have enjoyed many of the appetizers, most recently the tamale raviolis.  Husband claims will order them at every visit.  The rolling lettuce appetizers are enough for a main dish. Husband is picky about his pizza, from Italian heritage.  He has enjoyed many of the pizzas from the menu, and orders them always on the honey wheat crust. A few months ago I needed to cater a business meeting in Roseville.  In spite of the disappointing and surprising fact that the restaurant does not deliver catering orders, I went ahead with it despite the inconvenience.  I ordered a variety of pizzas, sandwich platters, salads, and dessert trays.  Guests were thrilled - loved the pizzas, sandwiches were impressive, salads were huge, and desserts were luscious.  The catering menu is arranged in a way that makes ordering for groups very convenient. I am impressed with the employees at this location, and at the others where I have also dined.  The employees seem empowered to offer something, provide special service, resolve issues, etc.  They seem to have very open, friendly communications with each other and with their managers.  There is none of the hiding in corners, whispering, complaining, that you sometimes see.  Also, to the restaurant's credit, we see the same servers and employees over and over again.  It must be a great place to work - there seems to be little or no turnover. Other Yelpers have commented on the servers' ability to visit with the guests.  We have enjoyed conversations with several of the servers at the bar; they do seem to have the luxury of visiting at length with the guests - it must be that they are expected and allowed to do so.  They are all pleasant, articulate, easy to visit with, coming across perfectly naturally. I haven't dared try the desserts yet - afraid I might develop a bad habit.  We discovered a long time ago that the flavored soda waters and iced teas can be a little too sweet for our tastes, and the servers will adjust the amount of flavoring to our liking. The food has been top quality at every visit, the service sincere and excellent, and the portions very generous.  This has fast become one of our routine stops.  And now I look for their locations when I am traveling on business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=120
Sheena S.,"Roseville, CA",0,7,1,4.0,5/2/2014,"My husband and I have eaten here many times, but last night was quite exceptional. Our server, Gwen, was probably the best server we've ever had...in ANY restaurant we've dined it (and we've dined in many). I was in a fickle/indecisive mood to start with so it took us 30 minutes to even decide where to eat that night. But we landed here, and were excited about their new summer menu (strawberry salads, new refreshing drinks). We sat outside on their patio, and I started off with their new Rhubarb Martini drink that had orange, strawberry, and rhubarb root which I had never tasted before. The drink was nice and cold, refreshing, but immediately I could tell that I didn't care for the rhubarb taste-as it was similar to ginger for me. Gwen, our waitress could tell I didn't like it-and she was offering other options instead to replace that one. I said ""no no, it's fine""....I felt bad. I did like the sour taste of it, but just not the vegetable root taste ha. And she goes, well just sit with it awhile and if you still don't like it, I'll make you something else to try. I gave it a few more sips but just couldn't handle the Rhubarb so she threw out some other ideas, and I agreed to try a Plum martini. She was so sweet, kindly brought it out...but alas, was way too sweet for my liking. I ended up not drinking either, and she was so sweet about the whole thing and went above and beyond that any server would normally do. The caramelized peach salad I ordered was very tasty, especially with the gorgonzola cheese they use. I was expecting the peaches to be fresh, but I could tell they were from a can-so that was a bit disappointing. But other than that the salad was very good and perfect size (I ordered a half). Then we decided to go for their strawberry shortcake for dessert and I must say it was to die for. Fresh strawberries, with a strawberry glaze sauce, small little crystals of sugar sprinkled on top a house made biscuit/scone type thing. She also included vanilla ice cream for us with the whipped cream. It was really good. But above the food, I'm writing because this was our best experience (service wise)...really anywhere. Thank you Gwen! She was cheerful, helpful, gracious, and went above and beyond. CPK please give her a raise because she definitely deserves it. Any company would be very grateful to have an employee like her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=120

When we come here we like to get an experienced waiter cause sometimes newer and younger waiters tend to be careless and the management is um weird. One of the managers was to busy chatting with another employee and I had to wait like 3 minute standing in front of him so I could ask for a child's menu. The other manager surprised us that she was a manager since she was wearing no uniform and looked like someone who didn't belong there. It's a nice experience almost every time.

I would hate for them to go out of business but after the service I had last night, I was not surprised to see why the restaurant was deserted on a Friday night. Our waiters name was Anthony, although when I first got there he was very nice and attentive, as the evening went- the service got progressively worse. I was absolutely embarrassed to bring my family to this restaurant. This guy had two tables and forgot to put in our drink order, probably forgot to put in our food order because it took FOREVER to get our food (all I got was a salad), and to top it all off it took him 20 minutes and me asking twice for him to bring us small plates for our food. The food was amazing, as always. I was just so stunned to see CPK so empty on a Friday and so saddened to have found out why. I wish only for the managers to take more of an initiative and make sure their servers are doing what they are suppose to be doing. Also there were four tables in the restaurant and I never saw the manager check on any of them (the table next to us seemed to have more problems than we did). I hope someone does something to pick up the service in this restaurant so it does not go out of business, but it is not looking good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=120

That wasn't happening with two kids. I walked across the parking lot to California Pizza Kitchen and knew they had salads, but figured I'd not have many options. Well they blew me away. They probably had 4 or 5 items with lots of ingredients that were all real food without the things I can't have. They easily accommodated my request for Olive Oil for my salad. There were at least 3 or 4 more items that could have been easily modified. The manager double checked everything was as we needed and the server was glad to ask the chef about something I wasn't sure about (it ended up being fine.)

No surprises otherwise, though: their typical, wide-ranging menu of pizzas, pastas, soups, and salads (although I do tend to be a creature of habit and invariably order either the jerk chicken or japanese eggplant pizzas). And of course your usual assortment of way-too-peppy-whitegirls-who-probably-wear-Uggs-year-round staffers.

Lene N.,"East Bay, CA",1432,853,4297,4.0,1/1/2018,"Things you need to order: 1) BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad - This salad is unique and is exactly what it means. Instead of a leafy style, the lettuce is chopped into fine squares, which makes it easier to eat- so easy you can eat it with a spoon since you can scoop with the salad. I also like this salad because it was the perfect amount of dressing. Along with chicken, this salad comes with tomatoes, beans, corn and tortilla chips and avocado (by the way this is extra $) but add it, because it adds great texture. Be sure to add Chillula hot sauce all over the salad, THIS really makes the salad delicious!  2) Tequila Lime Pasta - This Pasta Dish is my absolute favorite! It has a great kick with the tequila flavor cream sauce. With each bite, you have yummy chicken and bell peppers over a bed of al dente spinach pasta.

We ordered the buffalo cauliflower appetizer and 2 entrees plus 2 waters.  They separate the wait staff from the food runners so our food was brought by someone different that our waitress.  The appetizer came out and then she came by to see if everything was ok and that was the last we saw of her.  The entree came out not too much after ward which was great timing. all the tales were hopping and I understand but the table next to us were sat after us and for drinks and they were refilled several time and our waters were never refilled.  This became and issue as it was at least 30 minutes from when we finished until when our check was brought.  No water and we were not asked if we would like desert.  I guess if I bought lemonade like the table next door I would have gotten refills?  As we were in the corner by the bathroom no service staff came by to flag them down for help.  I almost got us and went to the hostess station to try and get out check.      I like the food here but I think it is overpriced.

The Roasted Veggie salad - sautéed artichoke hearts, asparagus, eggplant, red & yellow peppers, corn and sun-dried tomatoes served over cool Romaine with avocado and Dijon balsamic vinaigrette.  The warm and cool contrast was just what I was looking for.  A nice portion sized salad, filling, and opted for no protein.  A hearty solid meal. Sitting at a table top in the middle of the dining room can be a bit noisy but a good spot to catch the attention of the server if needed.  We didn't need server attention .. anymore than the good service that was provided.

Most of the other restaurants were either closed or too busy on a Friday night. It was a little after 9 and we were seated right away.  FOOD: Started off great with warm bread served while we wait. Was pleasantly surprised that it was happy hour so we ordered a salad and a spinach/artichoke dip from the HAPPY HOUR  menu. Also ordered a pasta with Alfredo sauce and a cheese pizza from the KIDS menu. The salad arrived and was plated very nicely, however, just very average and was able to eat only half of it. The dip arrived and it tasted canned and salty. The chips were stale and old. If I was paying full price and not HH price, I would definitely have complained and sent them back. The kids pasta was left uneaten. Hubs tasted it and said he don't blame the kid as it tasted awful. The kids cheese pizza was the only thing worth writing about. It was a good portion and very tasty. The kids meals included a drink and priced nicely.  SERVICE: Our server checked up on us a couple of times. I get that it's late and they ""should"" be busy cleaning up/getting ready for closing and would not be as attentive in service. However, we can see them just chatting with other servers on the back so the lack of service was really not acceptable. I had to try making eye contact a couple of times to get her attention.

This is the closest location to me now and we happened to be in the area at dinner time. We didn't want to head back over the hill towards home without a meal in our stomachs. We found easy parking in the overflow parking area. Once we entered we were greeted immediately and seated in a comfy booth. Our server was with us right away and explained the new menu offers to us - it's not just a world of pizza anymore. The menu now includes steak, fish, pasta and salad. I chose a cool beverage because of the hot day outsize - a frozen mango lemonade. The mango was faint but the flavoring was great. The waitress brought us bread with olive oil. I miss their old bread so this a downgrade a bit. French bread is ok but the old bread was perfect and did not need to be changed! For the main dish I opted for a new pasta offering - Asparagus and spinach spaghettini. I added shrimp because they sounded delicious mixed with all the veggies. When it arrived I was overwhelmed by the size of the bowl that was overflowing with pasta. The portion of shrimp seemed plentiful for the size of pasta. The spinach was all clumped together so it was hard to get a piece of spinach in each bite. I wish I was able to take the leftovers with me because I barely made it through half.

The pie was best key lime I've had, the bread they serve was soft and comes with olive oil. I can't wait to come back! The best part of the whole experience was our waitress, Julissa (I hope I spelled right), she was a really good waitress had our refill of drinks at our table before our 1st ones were gone, wasn't at our table every 5 minutes asking if we were ok like some do, was very sweet and helpful!

From a pretty upscale place like this, located at an upscale plaza like the fountains, you should expect good food. That's not the case here. Everything is bland and tasteless but propped up with fancy sauces to give some sort of flavor, very much like fast food chains. Chicken is bland, onions have no flavor, greens taste like water, smoked bacon is overly-overwhelming, and the dip they bring out with the bread is terrible! Just cheap olive oil w some other foolery.

The California Club was interesting, it had chicken and bacon topprd with baby greens in a light dressing and a slice of avocados on each slice. It was by the the best dish I had. The Works pizza was your normal combo pizza and that was good as well. The California fields salad was extremely crisp and delicious, containing cubs of watermelon and stwarderries, with some field greens and pistachios, lightly coated in a vinaigrette.  For dessert, the Strawberry shortcake was surprisingly large and had a good amount for 3 adults.

It's great! Food- 3.5/5. I always get the Tostada Pizza every time. I have never tried anything else because I love it so much! It is like having Mexican food and pizza at the same time! I also always go with the honey wheat crust which is great! The pizza is on a thin crust topped with black beans, cheese, lettuce and a ranch dressing. So good! Sometimes they skimp on the beans though, and I end up getting mostly cheese which can be disappointing. My Husband has gotten a few different versions of their pizza and has liked everyone, especially the Habanero Carnitas Pizza which comes with a super hot sauce to drizzle. He has also had their Jambalaya which he thought was good. We have come here with my parents before as well and my Dad loved the Margherita Pizza and ate almost the whole thing (which is unheard of in my family!!!) Atmosphere- 3.5/5. Standard chain restaurant atmosphere. Nice bar area, is always clean and never too loud or crowded. Service-3.5/5. We have never had any serious problems with service here, everyone is always nice and gets us seated quickly and taken care of. One time we ""lost"" our server when we were trying to get our leftovers boxed up and pay, but otherwise it has been great. Vegetarian Friendliness- 3/5. There are a few salads, pastas and pizzas to choose from so I never have a problem finding anything. Definitely recommend the Tostada Pizza though! Overall- 3.5/5.

Bryan L.,"Roseville, CA",5,281,,3.0,10/24/2014,"My coworker wanted to try some of their pizza after seeing it on a TV show called ""On The Menu"" but the food was just ok. I ordered online and after I picked them up they were barely warm (I assume they were sitting there for a while) and by the time I got back they were cold so I had to heat them in the oven.  The Korean BBQ Pizza had to be assembled before eating because apparently you're suppose to add the veggie toppings after the pizza is cooked. We tried it without the veggies and it was ok so we ate them as a side salad instead. The pizza is pretty much a Korean sandwich on a pie crust. Kind of like how people try to make taco pizzas or burger pizzas.  The Wild Mushroom Pizza was lackluster, at best. Reheating it didn't help so all the toppings were dried out and crunchy. Basically, it was like eating toast with a bit of cheese and mushrooms.  I assume that all the pizzas are the same size because when ordering, I did not have the option to choose a size and based on the price ($13 for the Korean BBQ and $12 for the Mushroom) I figured they were either about the size of a medium or small. The pizzas were somewhere in-between.  We had one slice left (they didn't cut the pizza evenly so this slice was like 1/3 of the whole pizza) and instead of heating it again I tried eating it cold and the crust was so hard it was like chewing through rubber.  If I ever go back, I'd eat the pizza there so that they're hot and fresh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=60

As we were pulling in I noticed that the coupons had expired the 14th of this month...which is 5 days ago.  I was curious if they would honor them, and would've completely understood if they didn't.   Well the server walked over to our table, and asked about drinks, and noticed our coupons sitting out, and said that that was over a while ago, but I will talk to my manager to see if we can do anything.  He came back and said, you can go ahead and open them and see what you could have won, my manager said we can't honor those, we don't have any way in the system to designate it for those coupons.  Like I said, they have every right to not honor the coupons...but the attitude was such that it didn't matter that they had customers that had returned to spend more money in their establishment. And were almost mocking us for thinking we were going to use them. So we decided to open them and see what they were worth.  Both coupons were for 10% off of our bill.  We started laughing...thinking...there's 2 of us...with drinks and dinner we would be anywhere from $40-$60.  The max discount would be $6!!

We were seated and within a minute our server Zachary arrived at table to take drink and appetizer orders. He was very friendly and made us laugh. Within a few minutes drinks and appetizers arrived, so all the kitchen staff we could see working fast really paid off. Zachary checked back many times, bringing us drinks, clearing plates, etc. A gal from kitchen brought our meals and they also came fast - yay! While we loved our appetizers of the wraps and the pot stickers, we really really loved our meals. I had the Chinese chicken salad and it was the best one I've ever had...for real! My husband had an amazing turkey sandwich with the most tasty roll -- very good he said. He also had the tortilla soup, which was amazing.

The majority of the group were Italian-American. None of them liked the pizza.

The servers did not get tipped...and they actually separated our group...so we had some sitting across the aisle, as if they were not part of the group. We had to go back and forth to get the pizza from the main table. We tried to make the best of it, but felt a bit left out by the separation. Apparently, they did not know that people with children need special seating...such as high chairs, etc. They sat us at an elevated booth while the rest of our party was on the floor at tables...guess they did not want to pull more tables to the group, although they knew well in advance the nature of our group.

Took Gary B's advice below about the BLT pizza and it WAS good; but I'd also recommend the chopped BBQ chicken salad, too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=140
Mr. B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,40,,2.0,2/21/2012,"My wife and I have been coming to this location for the last two years all the way from Folsom ( once a week ). I never had such a bad experience like I had yesterday. I don't want to mention the server's name on yelp but... she did not look happy to be there or serve her tables. It started with the host/server (I don't know) that approached the host stand once she saw us waiting and without saying hi/ hello or smiling, just asked "" for two?"". Wow...I should have predicted this following experience. Next..... we sat at what appears to be a  servers section were one server takes care of that area. Well.... she (server) passed by our table around 3 times in 5-7 min without even acknowledging us or saying anything that will reassure us that we are not some two invisible ghosts siting at the table. waiting and waiting and finally the server sorted out the confusion of who's table is that ( I have watched it across the room). finally got her coming to the table and taking our order. Either she had no desire to be there or she does not know what customer service is?  We ordered the tortilla spring rolls which was nothing to get excited about. No flavor what so ever (even with the peanut sauce or guacamole(first and last time ordering that). next we waited around 20min ( after finishing our appetizer) which I can only conclude that the server forgot to put the order in (to be sent to the kitchen). By the way.... the two main courses were Grilled Vegetable Sandwich and BBQ chicken salad which served cold. so.... there was no reason for a 20min delay after we have finished the appetizer other than the fact that the meals have been not sent to the kitchen in time and the servers laziness and lack of attention to details. I served tabled in the passed for 8 years so... trust me that I know.  Had she realized how small is the appetizer and how quickly two people can finish it she would have timed it better.  Here is the best part of waiting 20min for the food. I received my sandwich and it was literally flat. there was almost (I am being generous by saying almost) nothing inside. there were two small slices of tomato on each side of the sandwich and the portobello  mushroom was barely to be seeing. It was just crazy that the cook will make an $10+ sandwich looking like this. I never in my life returned something back to the kitchen but that was a really poor excuse for a sandwich. embarrassing!!!! My server as usual was no were to be found so I flagged the manager and showed her the sandwich and asked her if they run out of vegetables because I can't see them on my sad sandwich. All she had to say is I am sorry (which is okay) but.. she did not look in shock or anything. she asked me if I want anything else but I was already fed up with our absent server and waited for the food to long so I said that I will pass.  Our wonderful server passed by our table several times without even realizing that my wife is eating ""alone"" and I have no food in front of me. did I manage to finish my meal within 10min and that is why there is nothing in front of me?.  Had she paid attention to her tables while passing by them several times and/or coming and checking on us after 5min of serving the food like any server should....she would have discovered that was going on. after a wile she did come by and said sorry about that (sandwich) and did mention that she does not like the sandwiches there because it is a pizza place and not a sandwich place.  Okayyyyyyy..... so first of all thank you for not recommending about not ordering this awful sandwich, second, if this is a pizza place so how come they have salds and fried egg rolls, tacos and ect....... what a B.S... the BBQ salad is great. the cook did not care not care, and the service was awful.  After leaving CPK, I went to CHIPOTLE for a burrito. It felt like something has changed in the management and staff. If the management want to talk to me about my experience... there are welcome to contact me through yelp and I will call them myself ( considering some one there still cares).  Hope things will change so we can go back and enjoy like we used to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=140

Alfie C.,"Lincoln, United States",267,112,52,4.0,28/9/2016,"I have to tell you, we had the best experience at CPK and it was all because of our server Celia.  Typically if you have issues with the food, it's usually a really tough experience for me, to the point where it could ruin the overall experience, but if it weren't for Celia that would've been the case.  She was very accommodating and understanding.  The issue I had was the salad.  Personally I love salad, but there is something about arugula that really doesn't sit well with me.  It just isn't pleasant to eat.  When Celia came around to see how we were doing, my wife let her know that I wasn't really liking the arugula salad.  She was very kind enough to switch the salad out with a house salad.  I'm also not into blue cheese of any kind, whether it be dressing or butter.  My steak had blue cheese butter and she was kind enough to switch that out with regular butter.  If she wasn't so understanding I would've had a very bad experience and the rating would've likely not been good.  And the best thing of all was that butter cake with coffee!  Oh my goodness, it's so good.  That was a 10 for me.   If you have an opportunity to dine there, I hope your server is Celia.  She'll take great care of you!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=20

Jennifer S.,"Sacramento, United States",3358,493,984,3.0,25/2/2016,"We had the barbecue Hawaiian chicken pizza with bacon. The crust was quite bland and boring. It was honestly a bit on the small side for $17, and there were hardly any toppings on it. I mean there were maybe three pineapple bits on the whole thing. Still, it was enough that I wouldn't have been able to finish it by myself. I had the smaller half and was uncomfortably full, but I'm sure most guys would be able to polish it off pretty easily. I registered for their rewards program on my phone, so we got a free appetizer, and chose the corn guacamole and chips. It was really good, and it was pretty small, but the waitress had warned us that it was as small as it looked in the picture. It was probably like four tablespoons of guacamole and a large handful of corn tortilla chips for what would have been $5 (if it weren't free). The waitress was attentive and helpful. The food came out in a pretty reasonable amount of time, and we didn't have to wait to be seated. Based on this one pizza, I might have gone with two stars, but I've been here in the past many times and have always really liked their California Club pizza (which has avocado and bacon on it) and their avocado egg rolls. If memory serves, they also make a really good lemon drop. The tiramisu is good but not traditional. It's more like layers of vanilla cake and rum cake soaked in rum, with the whole thing covered with a rum mousse. We didn't seem to get any ladyfingers or espresso in ours, but it was still delicious.  Overall, I have enjoyed coming here, but the pizza is just not that great, and for the price, I think I can do better.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=20

Shanna R.,"Roseville, United States",299,12,3,1.0,27/6/2016,Worst.service.ever. I ordered what I order every time I come here and our server Dani was so quick to tell me they couldn't make it. Sounds like laziness to me... I had to tell her to ask her manager I didn't get an apology or any thing. A lot of attitude. I also asked for butter with my bread I had to ask about 4 times before I actually got it. I also had to wait way too long for a refill. I've never had this kind of service here. If you don't know how to have good customer service then maybe you shouldn't be a server.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=40
Nickolas H.,"Dixon, United States",3,11,25,5.0,11/10/2014,Best pizza kitchen ever.    So this is the second time I have been to a California Pizza Kitchen and I can say this is where a person should go if they never had pizza before.    I don't really like getting pizza out that often because at my school they sell pizza from Pizza Hut. This place is awesome. Everything is awesome about the place.     Customer Service is really good. Really friendly and when my father asked for a bigger chair outside they were happy to give it to him.    Pizza is the bomb. Each member of my family got a personal pizza. There are about 6 pieces in a personal and that could have fed 2 members of my family it was so big. Taste is really good and you can tell the food was fresh. Most pizza chain restaurants aren't that good but this place is.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=40

I had a delicious peach salad today and added grilled shrimp (so yummy). It was the perfect combination of sweet and savory and left me feeling filled up but without the guilt! But of course no meal is complete without your favorite drink. I opted for the Mango Mojito.

Lene N.,"East Bay, United States",1432,853,4297,4.0,1/1/2018,"Things you need to order: 1) BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad - This salad is unique and is exactly what it means. Instead of a leafy style, the lettuce is chopped into fine squares, which makes it easier to eat- so easy you can eat it with a spoon since you can scoop with the salad. I also like this salad because it was the perfect amount of dressing. Along with chicken, this salad comes with tomatoes, beans, corn and tortilla chips and avocado (by the way this is extra $) but add it, because it adds great texture. Be sure to add Chillula hot sauce all over the salad, THIS really makes the salad delicious!  2) Tequila Lime Pasta - This Pasta Dish is my absolute favorite! It has a great kick with the tequila flavor cream sauce. With each bite, you have yummy chicken and bell peppers over a bed of al dente spinach pasta. Again, add Chillula over this baby, and boom- it's so delicious!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2

It was basically pizza dough slathered with the peanut sauce. Total rip off for $15. The BBQ pizza we got was only marginally better.

Bread was warm. Oil mixture with herbs was okay. Nothing spectacular.  Pizza didn't take long to arrive. Pizza nice crust pesto cilantro onion chile. A tomatillo type salsa sauce was provided but unneeded. It added a little bite. Carne was tender and well flavored. Elements separately were good. Together they worked cohesively.

We ordered the buffalo cauliflower appetizer and 2 entrees plus 2 waters.  They separate the wait staff from the food runners so our food was brought by someone different that our waitress.  The appetizer came out and then she came by to see if everything was ok and that was the last we saw of her.  The entree came out not too much after ward which was great timing. all the tales were hopping and I understand but the table next to us were sat after us and for drinks and they were refilled several time and our waters were never refilled.  This became and issue as it was at least 30 minutes from when we finished until when our check was brought.  No water and we were not asked if we would like desert.  I guess if I bought lemonade like the table next door I would have gotten refills?  As we were in the corner by the bathroom no service staff came by to flag them down for help.  I almost got us and went to the hostess station to try and get out check.      I like the food here but I think it is overpriced. That reminded me why we rarely come here.  I would have loved to order an entree and a salad but they do not have a dinner salad and the half salads are almost $10.

Thank you Mr. Croce for introducing this review.  You don't mess around with Jim and you do not mess around with ordering anything but the BBQ Chicken Pizza from CPK. It is iconic for a reason. The Gouda, the BBQ sauce, the onion, the chicken...my heavens it is delicious!!!!! On this visit we went full on boring and ordered the Peppperoni (not my fault) and I was underwhelmed. Not because the pizza was bad but because comparing it to the icon, it was like drinking Bud next to a Sierra Nevada. No disrespect to Bud but there is a time and place for it (all day drinking, Raider game tailgating) and in my book Is not a great beer. That is my thoughts on a CPK Pepperoni Pizza. perfectly ok but when BBQ Chicken is available, not something you should bother with.

John H.,"Salado, United States",433,487,2057,4.0,1/2/2017,"I've been generally pleased with the food at various locations of California Pizza Kitchen.  This was no exception.  Rather than pizza at the pizza kitchen, I opted for a warmer salad. The Roasted Veggie salad - sautéed artichoke hearts, asparagus, eggplant, red & yellow peppers, corn and sun-dried tomatoes served over cool Romaine with avocado and Dijon balsamic vinaigrette.  The warm and cool contrast was just what I was looking for.  A nice portion sized salad, filling, and opted for no protein.  A hearty solid meal. Sitting at a table top in the middle of the dining room can be a bit noisy but a good spot to catch the attention of the server if needed.  We didn't need server attention .. anymore than the good service that was provided.

M O.,"Sacramento, United States",0,35,2,3.0,5/8/2017,"Arrived late on a Friday night as kids got hungry after hanging out at the Fountains. Most of the other restaurants were either closed or too busy on a Friday night. It was a little after 9 and we were seated right away.  FOOD: Started off great with warm bread served while we wait. Was pleasantly surprised that it was happy hour so we ordered a salad and a spinach/artichoke dip from the HAPPY HOUR  menu. Also ordered a pasta with Alfredo sauce and a cheese pizza from the KIDS menu. The salad arrived and was plated very nicely, however, just very average and was able to eat only half of it. The dip arrived and it tasted canned and salty. The chips were stale and old. If I was paying full price and not HH price, I would definitely have complained and sent them back. The kids pasta was left uneaten. Hubs tasted it and said he don't blame the kid as it tasted awful. The kids cheese pizza was the only thing worth writing about. It was a good portion and very tasty. The kids meals included a drink and priced nicely.  SERVICE: Our server checked up on us a couple of times. I get that it's late and they ""should"" be busy cleaning up/getting ready for closing and would not be as attentive in service. However, we can see them just chatting with other servers on the back so the lack of service was really not acceptable. I had to try making eye contact a couple of times to get her attention.

This is the closest location to me now and we happened to be in the area at dinner time. We didn't want to head back over the hill towards home without a meal in our stomachs. We found easy parking in the overflow parking area. Once we entered we were greeted immediately and seated in a comfy booth. Our server was with us right away and explained the new menu offers to us - it's not just a world of pizza anymore. The menu now includes steak, fish, pasta and salad. I chose a cool beverage because of the hot day outsize - a frozen mango lemonade. The mango was faint but the flavoring was great. The waitress brought us bread with olive oil. I miss their old bread so this a downgrade a bit. French bread is ok but the old bread was perfect and did not need to be changed! For the main dish I opted for a new pasta offering - Asparagus and spinach spaghettini. I added shrimp because they sounded delicious mixed with all the veggies. When it arrived I was overwhelmed by the size of the bowl that was overflowing with pasta. The portion of shrimp seemed plentiful for the size of pasta. The spinach was all clumped together so it was hard to get a piece of spinach in each bite. I wish I was able to take the leftovers with me because I barely made it through half. The waitress was attentive and ensured we were comfortable and had everything we needed.

It's great! Food- 3.5/5. I always get the Tostada Pizza every time. I have never tried anything else because I love it so much! It is like having Mexican food and pizza at the same time! I also always go with the honey wheat crust which is great! The pizza is on a thin crust topped with black beans, cheese, lettuce and a ranch dressing. So good! Sometimes they skimp on the beans though, and I end up getting mostly cheese which can be disappointing. My Husband has gotten a few different versions of their pizza and has liked everyone, especially the Habanero Carnitas Pizza which comes with a super hot sauce to drizzle. He has also had their Jambalaya which he thought was good. We have come here with my parents before as well and my Dad loved the Margherita Pizza and ate almost the whole thing (which is unheard of in my family!!!) Atmosphere- 3.5/5.

I ordered online and after I picked them up they were barely warm (I assume they were sitting there for a while) and by the time I got back they were cold so I had to heat them in the oven.  The Korean BBQ Pizza had to be assembled before eating because apparently you're suppose to add the veggie toppings after the pizza is cooked. We tried it without the veggies and it was ok so we ate them as a side salad instead. The pizza is pretty much a Korean sandwich on a pie crust. Kind of like how people try to make taco pizzas or burger pizzas.  The Wild Mushroom Pizza was lackluster, at best. Reheating it didn't help so all the toppings were dried out and crunchy. Basically, it was like eating toast with a bit of cheese and mushrooms.  I assume that all the pizzas are the same size because when ordering, I did not have the option to choose a size and based on the price ($13 for the Korean BBQ and $12 for the Mushroom) I figured they were either about the size of a medium or small. The pizzas were somewhere in-between.  We had one slice left (they didn't cut the pizza evenly so this slice was like 1/3 of the whole pizza) and instead of heating it again I tried eating it cold and the crust was so hard it was like chewing through rubber.

We went back in armed with coupons that we received the last time we ate there, and had to return to have a manager open them to reveal what we ""won"". As we were pulling in I noticed that the coupons had expired the 14th of this month...which is 5 days ago.  I was curious if they would honor them, and would've completely understood if they didn't.   Well the server walked over to our table, and asked about drinks, and noticed our coupons sitting out, and said that that was over a while ago, but I will talk to my manager to see if we can do anything.  He came back and said, you can go ahead and open them and see what you could have won, my manager said we can't honor those, we don't have any way in the system to designate it for those coupons.  Like I said, they have every right to not honor the coupons...but the attitude was such that it didn't matter that they had customers that had returned to spend more money in their establishment. And were almost mocking us for thinking we were going to use them. So we decided to open them and see what they were worth.  Both coupons were for 10% off of our bill.  We started laughing...thinking...there's 2 of us...with drinks and dinner we would be anywhere from $40-$60.  The max discount would be $6!! SIX FREAKING DOLLARS!!  We thought well they made their decision...traded away $40-$60 for $6...we can make our choice too...we vote with our dollars...and we decided we aren't casting our dollars here!!

So we started calling around to other places in the parking lot and when we called CPK they told us that we could come over and get seated right away. So we walked over and got seated the waiter took our orders pretty fast was very helpful in the process of ordering with all our questions. I ordered the Pesto Cream Penne with Chicken and it was Delicious. Usually I'm not a fan of penne pastas but this was soooo good. Honestly going to CPK was such a better choice i think anyways because my friend loves pizza and they were so quick about everything. I would give them 5 stars but two of my friends had to ask about their pizzas that they ordered and the waiter went to check and when he came back he said that they had just started making them.

So, after talking with the staff, I learned that you can order any of their pizzas on a gluten free crust, but that the only ones they can guarantee are absolutely gluten free (prepared in a separate area, cooked in a separate space, etc) are the ones listen on the gluten free menu.

How can you go wrong with melty mozzarella, fresh tomatoes and fresh basil? Upon my most recent excursion I decided to try something new. I perused the salad section of the menu and found two that sounded tasty...the grilled vegetable salad and the Thai crunch salad. When our server returned I asked for her recommendation between the two. She recommended the Thai crunch salad hands down. Sold!  The verdict? Absolutely delicious. The salad had edamame, crunchy rice sticks and wontons, crisp lettuce and peanuts. The dressing had a most wonderful peanutty flavor. Scrumptious. I'm so glad that I ordered the half portion though.

Shannon G.,"Fair Oaks, United States",34,199,1,5.0,16/3/2010,"I avoid the chains.  I like giving my business to locally owned independents. I love CPK.  We patronize the Roseville location frequently.  We love sitting at the bar to eat.  Watching the employees prepare the pizza, and seeing the activity throughout the kitchen area, is a pleasure.  Have you ever wondered, or worried, about what goes on behind the scenes?  Here there is no mystery - they are confident enough to let you see it all. The Cream of Asparagus soup, dairy free, is out of this world.  I'd order it on the hottest day of the year.  The CPK Cobb is my favorite salad - beets on request, quality salad dressings to choose from, and the half portion is MORE than enough! We have enjoyed many of the appetizers, most recently the tamale raviolis.  Husband claims will order them at every visit.  The rolling lettuce appetizers are enough for a main dish. Husband is picky about his pizza, from Italian heritage.  He has enjoyed many of the pizzas from the menu, and orders them always on the honey wheat crust. A few months ago I needed to cater a business meeting in Roseville.  In spite of the disappointing and surprising fact that the restaurant does not deliver catering orders, I went ahead with it despite the inconvenience.  I ordered a variety of pizzas, sandwich platters, salads, and dessert trays.  Guests were thrilled - loved the pizzas, sandwiches were impressive, salads were huge, and desserts were luscious.  The catering menu is arranged in a way that makes ordering for groups very convenient. I am impressed with the employees at this location, and at the others where I have also dined.  The employees seem empowered to offer something, provide special service, resolve issues, etc.  They seem to have very open, friendly communications with each other and with their managers.  There is none of the hiding in corners, whispering, complaining, that you sometimes see.  Also, to the restaurant's credit, we see the same servers and employees over and over again.  It must be a great place to work - there seems to be little or no turnover. Other Yelpers have commented on the servers' ability to visit with the guests.  We have enjoyed conversations with several of the servers at the bar; they do seem to have the luxury of visiting at length with the guests - it must be that they are expected and allowed to do so.  They are all pleasant, articulate, easy to visit with, coming across perfectly naturally. I haven't dared try the desserts yet - afraid I might develop a bad habit.  We discovered a long time ago that the flavored soda waters and iced teas can be a little too sweet for our tastes, and the servers will adjust the amount of flavoring to our liking. The food has been top quality at every visit, the service sincere and excellent, and the portions very generous.  This has fast become one of our routine stops.  And now I look for their locations when I am traveling on business.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=120
Sheena S.,"Roseville, United States",0,7,1,4.0,2/5/2014,"My husband and I have eaten here many times, but last night was quite exceptional. Our server, Gwen, was probably the best server we've ever had...in ANY restaurant we've dined it (and we've dined in many). I was in a fickle/indecisive mood to start with so it took us 30 minutes to even decide where to eat that night. But we landed here, and were excited about their new summer menu (strawberry salads, new refreshing drinks). We sat outside on their patio, and I started off with their new Rhubarb Martini drink that had orange, strawberry, and rhubarb root which I had never tasted before. The drink was nice and cold, refreshing, but immediately I could tell that I didn't care for the rhubarb taste-as it was similar to ginger for me. Gwen, our waitress could tell I didn't like it-and she was offering other options instead to replace that one. I said ""no no, it's fine""....I felt bad. I did like the sour taste of it, but just not the vegetable root taste ha. And she goes, well just sit with it awhile and if you still don't like it, I'll make you something else to try. I gave it a few more sips but just couldn't handle the Rhubarb so she threw out some other ideas, and I agreed to try a Plum martini. She was so sweet, kindly brought it out...but alas, was way too sweet for my liking. I ended up not drinking either, and she was so sweet about the whole thing and went above and beyond that any server would normally do. The caramelized peach salad I ordered was very tasty, especially with the gorgonzola cheese they use. I was expecting the peaches to be fresh, but I could tell they were from a can-so that was a bit disappointing. But other than that the salad was very good and perfect size (I ordered a half). Then we decided to go for their strawberry shortcake for dessert and I must say it was to die for. Fresh strawberries, with a strawberry glaze sauce, small little crystals of sugar sprinkled on top a house made biscuit/scone type thing. She also included vanilla ice cream for us with the whipped cream. It was really good. But above the food, I'm writing because this was our best experience (service wise)...really anywhere. Thank you Gwen! She was cheerful, helpful, gracious, and went above and beyond. CPK please give her a raise because she definitely deserves it.

The other manager surprised us that she was a manager since she was wearing no uniform and looked like someone who didn't belong there. It's a nice experience almost every time. We like the Habanero pizza and the White pizza,",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=120

Danielle V.,"Rocklin, United States",215,13,1,2.0,11/5/2014,"It pains me to write this review because I LOVE California Pizza Kitchen and have been eating there for as long as I can remember. I would hate for them to go out of business but after the service I had last night, I was not surprised to see why the restaurant was deserted on a Friday night. Our waiters name was Anthony, although when I first got there he was very nice and attentive, as the evening went- the service got progressively worse. I was absolutely embarrassed to bring my family to this restaurant. This guy had two tables and forgot to put in our drink order, probably forgot to put in our food order because it took FOREVER to get our food (all I got was a salad), and to top it all off it took him 20 minutes and me asking twice for him to bring us small plates for our food. The food was amazing, as always. I was just so stunned to see CPK so empty on a Friday and so saddened to have found out why. I wish only for the managers to take more of an initiative and make sure their servers are doing what they are suppose to be doing. Also there were four tables in the restaurant and I never saw the manager check on any of them (the table next to us seemed to have more problems than we did). I hope someone does something to pick up the service in this restaurant so it does not go out of business, but it is not looking good.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=120

We were going to go to Yardhouse because I figured I could get seafood, chicken, or steak with some veggies. Well after arriving it was a 45 minute to 1 hour wait. That wasn't happening with two kids. I walked across the parking lot to California Pizza Kitchen and knew they had salads, but figured I'd not have many options. Well they blew me away. They probably had 4 or 5 items with lots of ingredients that were all real food without the things I can't have. They easily accommodated my request for Olive Oil for my salad. There were at least 3 or 4 more items that could have been easily modified. The manager double checked everything was as we needed and the server was glad to ask the chef about something I wasn't sure about (it ended up being fine.)

No surprises otherwise, though: their typical, wide-ranging menu of pizzas, pastas, soups, and salads (although I do tend to be a creature of habit and invariably order either the jerk chicken or japanese eggplant pizzas).

The candied walnuts and sliced grapes give this salad an extra something yummy that every time I eat it...I'm sad when it's gone. I've tried their chocolate souffle cake, it's alright.

I tried making it at home once. I had all the ingredients. It tasted okay. I kind of felt like I was being polite to myself, though.

Zachary checked back many times, bringing us drinks, clearing plates, etc. A gal from kitchen brought our meals and they also came fast - yay! While we loved our appetizers of the wraps and the pot stickers, we really really loved our meals. I had the Chinese chicken salad and it was the best one I've ever had...for real! My husband had an amazing turkey sandwich with the most tasty roll -- very good he said. He also had the tortilla soup, which was amazing. Zachary and kitchen gal who brought food checked in many times and we stayed longer than planned because they were so awesome and we could relax in a great environment.

The servers did not get tipped...and they actually separated our group...so we had some sitting across the aisle, as if they were not part of the group. We had to go back and forth to get the pizza from the main table. We tried to make the best of it, but felt a bit left out by the separation. Apparently, they did not know that people with children need special seating...such as high chairs, etc. They sat us at an elevated booth while the rest of our party was on the floor at tables...guess they did not want to pull more tables to the group, although they knew well in advance the nature of our group.

Pete W.,"Antelope, United States",0,15,3,5.0,12/7/2011,"Over the past several years we've eaten at CPK many times for one reason and one reason only we've never had a bad meal there. Under unusal circumstances we ate there again last Sunday. We hadn't plan to eat at CPK, but we had such a bad experience with the food at the new Yard House Roseville that we opted to pop into CPK for some food that you could actually enjoy. As usual CPK did a great job!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=140

Melanie B.,"Loomis, United States",7,48,60,3.0,29/6/2010,"Food is better than average. The Tuscan hummus appetizer though is quite amazing; where else do you find hummus in a restaurant!? I had the margherita pizza and my boyfriend had the grilled chicken Caesar sandwich. I wasn't super impressed with my pizza; it seems the cooks threw a handful of basil on it and didn't bother spreading it out. My boyfriend really enjoyed his sandwich, and it's cool you get different unusual choices for bread. I might go back, but not for that pizza; the margherita pizza at Primo's is waaaaay better. Also, our server Natalie was very attentive and nice; excellent service!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=140
Steve O.,"Roseville, United States",45,9,23,5.0,20/7/2009,"Our family loves CPK! We love the Thai Chicken pizza ... it's our favorite.  It's one of the more attractive locations of CPKs we have dined in (located in the Fountains). Our kids are well distracted with their crayons and cool coloring books, but my suggestion is still to have your order ready to go when the server arrives. It can get quite busy at this location. We usually receive good service too, but all the servers we have encountered have been extremely friendly. Very clean establishment. Make an evening out of coming here and walk around the Fountains afterwards and grab a fro-yo.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=140
Mark M.,"Roseville, United States",5,30,,4.0,26/2/2010,"I've been to CPK now three or four times for lunch and dinner and I'm a fan for the most part. The good stuff first: (a) variety of food, (b) open environment, (c) the bar access for quicker meals, (d) friendly staff. The not-so-good: (a) the drink selection is weak (no Dr Pepper, no Coke); (b) waiting for a table can be long if arrive on Fri/Sat pm; (c) prices are a little steeper than some other middle-of-the-road places in town. Order a pizza, a salmon salad, a BBQ chicken salad, two sodas and two desserts and you're in for $60 plus tip. The environment is very good, however. They keep the place clean, open and friendly. This is good for business meetings, family functions and it's kid-friendly. Took Gary B's advice below about the BLT pizza and it WAS good; but I'd also recommend the chopped BBQ chicken salad, too.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=140
Mr. B.,"San Francisco, United States",0,40,,2.0,21/2/2012,"My wife and I have been coming to this location for the last two years all the way from Folsom ( once a week ). I never had such a bad experience like I had yesterday. I don't want to mention the server's name on yelp but... she did not look happy to be there or serve her tables. It started with the host/server (I don't know) that approached the host stand once she saw us waiting and without saying hi/ hello or smiling, just asked "" for two?"". Wow...I should have predicted this following experience. Next..... we sat at what appears to be a  servers section were one server takes care of that area. Well.... she (server) passed by our table around 3 times in 5-7 min without even acknowledging us or saying anything that will reassure us that we are not some two invisible ghosts siting at the table. waiting and waiting and finally the server sorted out the confusion of who's table is that ( I have watched it across the room). finally got her coming to the table and taking our order. Either she had no desire to be there or she does not know what customer service is?  We ordered the tortilla spring rolls which was nothing to get excited about. No flavor what so ever (even with the peanut sauce or guacamole(first and last time ordering that). next we waited around 20min ( after finishing our appetizer) which I can only conclude that the server forgot to put the order in (to be sent to the kitchen). By the way.... the two main courses were Grilled Vegetable Sandwich and BBQ chicken salad which served cold. so.... there was no reason for a 20min delay after we have finished the appetizer other than the fact that the meals have been not sent to the kitchen in time and the servers laziness and lack of attention to details. I served tabled in the passed for 8 years so... trust me that I know.  Had she realized how small is the appetizer and how quickly two people can finish it she would have timed it better.  Here is the best part of waiting 20min for the food. I received my sandwich and it was literally flat. there was almost (I am being generous by saying almost) nothing inside. there were two small slices of tomato on each side of the sandwich and the portobello  mushroom was barely to be seeing. It was just crazy that the cook will make an $10+ sandwich looking like this. I never in my life returned something back to the kitchen but that was a really poor excuse for a sandwich. embarrassing!!!! My server as usual was no were to be found so I flagged the manager and showed her the sandwich and asked her if they run out of vegetables because I can't see them on my sad sandwich. All she had to say is I am sorry (which is okay) but.. she did not look in shock or anything. she asked me if I want anything else but I was already fed up with our absent server and waited for the food to long so I said that I will pass.  Our wonderful server passed by our table several times without even realizing that my wife is eating ""alone"" and I have no food in front of me. did I manage to finish my meal within 10min and that is why there is nothing in front of me?.  Had she paid attention to her tables while passing by them several times and/or coming and checking on us after 5min of serving the food like any server should....she would have discovered that was going on. after a wile she did come by and said sorry about that (sandwich) and did mention that she does not like the sandwiches there because it is a pizza place and not a sandwich place.  Okayyyyyyy..... so first of all thank you for not recommending about not ordering this awful sandwich, second, if this is a pizza place so how come they have salds and fried egg rolls, tacos and ect....... what a B.S... the BBQ salad is great. the cook did not care not care, and the service was awful.  After leaving CPK, I went to CHIPOTLE for a burrito. It felt like something has changed in the management and staff. If the management want to talk to me about my experience... there are welcome to contact me through yelp and I will call them myself ( considering some one there still cares).  Hope things will change so we can go back and enjoy like we used to.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=140
