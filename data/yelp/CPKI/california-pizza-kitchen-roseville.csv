Joseph O.,"Saint Paul, MN",9,6,,4.0,5/21/2010,"The food was pretty good but the service that I got from our waiter, I think his name was nick, was phenomenal. I'm not a big mall restaurant guy, i think maybe the items were a little over priced but he was upselling with class! I was so happy with his presentation and poise I wanted to buy more. Very entertaining! Thanks",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville
Amy R.,"Saint Paul, MN",308,1266,1214,3.0,12/9/2010,"This location must be going for the warm and inviting feel. I like the way this one is laid out in comparison with some of the other locations.  Our host ended up being our server. Nice enough guy and had the voice of someone who should be doing voice overs. I liked hearing him talk. Guacamole if you can call it that was way too trendo than the guacamole I'm used to. It came in a small solid shaped mass that wasn't that guacamole-ish at all. Corn with a few chunks of avocado mixed in along with about 15 white and blue chips served on the trendy chain rectangular white dish. The Thai Crunch Salad is really good and is probably on the list of ""Eat This, Not That"". Half size portion was plenty big. Avocado is an extra $2.00 but is well worth it. The crispy wonton strips on the salad also add an extra flavor. J ordered the BBQ pizza which was ok. I snagged a few bites and it just tasted very manufactured and mall- ish but it was ok. Decent enough place to drop in for a quick bite, but not a place to go with high expectations fit for a foodie. Especially when the bill comes and you realize you could have spent that amount at a less aesthetic and less trendy place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville
Sonja R.,"St Paul, MN",56,59,,3.0,9/7/2010,I like CPK when I want a completely unique pizza. They have the oddest combinations and ingredients which end up being deilicious. However. the last time I was there the power went out and we had to sit for 40 minutes waiting for our waiter to write us a paper bill. We were ready to approximate our bill and just leave it in cash on the table. it was extremely frustrating and we were late for a movie because of it. It seems to me that in a situation such as this there should be an apology and maybe even a coupon for money off next visit. There were nothing of the sort and now I fear that I won't be returning to this particular CPK.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville
T.S. M.,"Minneapolis, MN",1,60,,3.0,8/19/2009,"Pretty good, interesting pizza.  I like Punch Pizza more beacuse it tastes fresher.  If you like different toppings on your pizza, you should try Mesa in Dinkytown.  They pretty much make any topping you can imagine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville
Kevin M.,"Minneapolis, MN",69,139,57,3.0,11/25/2008,"I very seldom find myself looking for food in the suburbs.  But today I was at Rosedale spending some gift cards, and thought I'd grab some lunch.  I've been to the CPK once or twice before, and never had any complaints.  This location, while not somewhere I'd necessarily frequent, is pretty solid.  The service is pleasant and quick, the menu is ample and well-executed, and the wine list is reasonably priced.  For the quality of the food (tasty, but nothing too far out of the ordinary), I don't know that I would dine here at full menu price, but go for lunch.  They have a list of small pizzas, pastas, and sandwiches available with a soup or salad for $7.99.  It really is a lot of decent food for the price you pay.  I'll be eating the rest of my Thai chicken pizza tomorrow for lunch.  For eight bucks, I can't argue with that.  I wouldn't really make this place a destination, but if I'm hungry at the mall, I'll look for them first.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville
