Victor E.,"New Braunfels, TX",0,2,,5.0,12/9/2017,A great place to bring the family. The bread is amazing!  There pizza is absolutely amazing and would recommend the Hawaiian pizza or the cheese pizza. The waiters and waitresses are super nice and there salads are truly amazing! Would recommend 10/10,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-antonio-2
Yiv G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,12,,2.0,7/29/2017,I'm having such a hard time with this location. I try to suggest other places to family and friends but sometimes people insist on CPK. I had a big long hair in my Chinese chicken salad today and it wasn't mine. The salad in general didn't look that great even before the hair - the lettuce was full of black pieces. Is it impossible to get fresh lettuce at restaurants in San Antonio? And I hate ice water with one melted cube of ice.  There are better places. I'm sure of it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-antonio-2
Adam W.,"San Antonio, TX",0,81,24,1.0,12/15/2017,"So I wanted pizza yesterday and happen to be close to this place so my gf and I said sure why not . Big what a mistake, we started with the artichoke dip which we found to be inedible, it was seriously the worst artichoke dip we'd ever had . Next we had the bbq pizza and a pepperoni pizza, the pizza seemed to be tolerable at least the pepperoni one was the bbq one was terrible, the bbq sauce just doesn't work on a pizza , it's like do want be a pizza or do you want to be bbq pick one . At this point we are two slices in a we both said to each other, I think their frozen store bought pizza is better and yeah it is ! This is not the place if you want good pizza , should have went to Grimaldis across the street. Now here's what really brought me to my one star rating , who am I kidding I would have been one star regardless but here it is , minutes after taking our order my waiter walks over with a broom and dust pan , does not use it ! Sets it down literally across from where we are eat nasty artichoke dip and walks away ! It's stayed there the entire meal ! Several employees walked by it but none touch it ! It was so close to use that it conveyed a feeling of eating in a BROOM CLOSET! This place is garbage and as far as I'm concerned this place doesn't exist anymore. CHECK OUT THE BROOM PIC BELOW.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-antonio-2
Pinkey P.,"San Antonio, TX",273,49,56,2.0,8/6/2017,"If you've never been to CPK, and are wondering if you should try it I would say skip it. The pizza is sub-par and service is slow at this location. I love pizza and truly try out so many places to find my favorites pie, but this place was just off on taste. I also tried the pasta and while the sauce was fine, I felt like it was undercooked. But overall what completely surprised me was how they sent out our food, at a six person table they brought out 5 peoples food at once. My other friend had to wait about 10 minutes after we received ours, which was just awkward.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-antonio-2
Lesley S.,"San Antonio, TX",941,1200,1299,5.0,9/27/2016,"CPK is one of my favorite places to go. The pizzas are great, even the apps, however the Chicken Milanese is  . It is a breaded chicken, arugula, tomatoes, olive oil, and shaved Parmesan. So delicious. Use the lemon give because it makes an explosion in yo mouth. I had Brian at the bar is who I used because I was dining solo. He was an amazing bartender and attentive. I will go to him back time and time. Found out he was a veteran and a really hard worker.

Next time here i'll be wearing my ""stretchy pants.""  Such a very friendly staff and great environment for families, couples, or a big group.

Jacqueline J.,"San Antonio, TX",439,168,935,4.0,11/17/2015,"The Family and I enjoyed CPK as part of the Annual Parade of Veterans that flocked to neighboring eateries as they honored our Valor and Service. Last year I heard there was over a 2 hour wait so after the family and I polished off our Free pancakes at IHOP, we rolled on over to the Quarry to walk off the bacon and eggs. Luckily the rain that was threatening to ruin our Veteran's Meal held off and we pulled up to an empty CPK around 1015.  We peeped in and saw workers scurrying by as I'm sure they knew the Veteran's and Active Duty Crowd would be pouring in as the doors were unlocked.  After walking around window shopping for 30 or so minutes, the family and I returned to roughly a 3 person line that was starting to grow by the second.  We hopped in line and within ten minutes were seated by a gracious host and an attentive waiter. The Sister and I shared a BBQ Pizza and donated her Hawaiian Pizza to the nieces who happily gobbled up and pulled apart their ham and pineapples meal.. The brother n law ate a rather large salad, which I'm surprised he was able to finish after all the pancakes we had consumed that morning.  The waiter was quick and within minutes every seat in the establishment was full.  I can't say it's worth waiting 2 hours in line but this AF Veteran and Army Soldier along with her family enjoyed yet another Free Meal on Veteran's day. I appreciate the frozen entrees in the store but was elated to share this Day and  freshly baked meal with the family. Side Note ~ The restaurant was awesome in honoring our service but did not check our IDs.  I hope that scrupulous people who like to impose as military members do not take advantage of this day and ruin for those serving. It is used to honor the thousands across the nation that have served and are currently serving.  Thank you Again CPK. The Pizza was Great and made for an awesome midnight snack. See Ya Next year.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-antonio-2
Sarah J.,"San Antonio, TX",96,247,213,4.0,12/29/2016,"CPK has long been a favorite dinner spot for me, and one of the few chains I have on my frequent-customer list. I just love their small plates and I always order a thin crust Hawaiian pizza with extra pineapples. The pizza is fresh made and wood fired in their open kitchen for you to watch. Dessert menu is worth a look too! My husband isn't really a big fan, so it's not something we do as often as I'd like. I swear it's because it had California in the name, and it drives him crazy when I sit there and talk about ""when I used to live in California..."" He ate up half that pizza though! (He's not usually a big eater.) On that note, if you don't have a large appetite, order one pizza to share. It's enough for 2 people of you aren't overly hungry or if you're adding an appetizer as well.  I miss going to the Quarry location because there was a server there I loved, an older gentleman I think of Polish decent. He was always the perfect customer service rep and should be the face of that company! Maybe I'll stop back in and see if he's still there one day! My Yelp rating system: 5 stars= Add this to your bucket list! 4 stars= I would recommend visiting. 3 stars= Average, acceptable, positive. 2 stars= You might be able to drag me in.  1 star= I will definitely not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-antonio-2

I've never had a bad experience here and particularly, I'm not a fan of chain restaurants. But today was worthy of a review. My Observation today: The server/bartender did his best to accommodate all guests at the bar. The manager was all action in the kitchen ensuring that the tickets matched the food being prepared. The kitchen chefs and cooks communicated to the staff if a ticket order was questionable. Sadly, others had a few complaints about the hostess whom I didn't meet or greet because I skipped right to the bar area. However, I did notice she was hustling to the tables, to ensure they were guest ""ready."" It was a busy Sunday unfolding to an easy night.

Ramona P.,"Clearwater, FL",101,49,11,5.0,6/4/2017,Great place!!! It is really good food. We got the Thai Chicken pizza and the peanut sauce was really good.

Vincent P.,"Austin, TX",310,72,84,4.0,3/13/2016,"It has been a while since I've been to a California Pizza Kitchen.  This time around I really enjoyed it.  I wish I remembered what my experience was last time I went, however, its been that long if I can't remember.  So, I can only review California Pizza Kitchen based on my experience from yesterday 03/12/2016, so here I go. I loved the atmosphere here and everyone was very nice.  The food was better than I had expected it to be.  So, that is a plus.  I ordered the Pear Gorgonzola Pizza that was $13.39, I asked for it to be on hand tossed crust.  It was amazingly good.  I also go a cup of Baked Potato soup which was also amazing $4.79, plus my drink Fresh Strawberry Mango Cooler $2.99.  The pizza is big enough for two people to share, however, if you're really hungry - a whole one is a good size.  The price of the items are not that expensive, I think this is a really good place to go to if you're on a budget, but also a good place if you better options than any fast food restaurants.  Now on customer service.  Macie, our server was very nice.  She seemed to really go out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed.  My friend ordered a Mojito while I ordered the Strawberry Mango, however, our server brought us water later on without us even ordering it.  I thought that was very thoughtful of her.  That is what makes a server stand out, little things such as the thoughtfulness of the needs of their customers without the customers even asking.   I would recommend others to come check out California Pizza Kitchen at this location for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-antonio-2

The pepperoni had 1 piece per slice maybe 2 if your lucky. The cheese was so thin you could see the crust! Then Hawaiian had pineapple that tasted like it came from a can and no Canadian bacon it was delivered ham. 1 piece of ham and 1 pineapple per slice. Waitress was non existent, all she knew how to do was fill up my tea glass. At the end there was so much ice in the glass 3 sips and the tea was gone.

Aydee M.,"San Antonio, TX",0,3,,2.0,4/11/2015,"Wow, CPK! Way to ruin a meal.  CPK at the Quarry has been my go to place for dinner with my boys, but today may have changed that. We got there at 5pm. Place  pretty empty. We get shown to our table. A table with lots of food on the floor! I asked the hostess if the food could be cleaned or maybe we could be seated elsewhere. She went off to get a broom and dustpan and attempted to get it swept up.  Didn't do a very good job of it. There was still food under one of the chairs. I don't understand why the floor wasn't cleaned prior to seating us. It was very visible that the floor was dirty around our table as well as other areas of the restaurant. It really grosses me out to see dirty floors in a place I will be eating. Then to make the dining experience worse, our waiter, Jay, provided below par service. Plus, the chips were stale!

One staff member was leaning on the end of the corner looking bored out of his mind and was staring at the tv. Another member was on Facebook checking out guy pictures that I was able to see. Another member was slurping water while behind the counter.

Tami S.,"San Antonio, TX",34,103,79,4.0,3/12/2015,"good food and service... I had seen the note on yelp about free small plate offer and had signed up in advance of visit. we ordered, including small plate for coupon offer. our waiter made a point of coming back by to let us know about the offer so we could get the item for free. LOVE that! I like when the staff informs you of offer sir promotions. there on spring break with hubbie, mom-in-law and sons ages 13 and 18. kids both ordered same lunch special: bbq chicken pizza and potato soup. adults all ordered same pizza: shaved mushroom and spinach and hubbie and mom had Sedona tortilla soup while I opted for the spinach and quinoa salad. free app was bianco flatbread. flatbread was good and we each had a slice. blue cheese is a little strong if you aren't used to it. but even kids ate it without complaint. it was tasty and flatbread wasn't too thin or hard. both pizza types were very good, although mushroom pizzas all seemed to have fillings at center with very WIDE crusts. I don't like onions - red onions came on bbq chicken pizza. but when I snagged a bite of my son's I found I preferred the onions on it - nice balance of flavors. mushroom pizza was good, just enough cheese, mushroom flavors came through. crust was yummy! potato soup was rich but good. Sedona tortilla was thick and creamy and flavor reminded me of cheese enchiladas. my salad was great, nice, big and FRESH! but the champagne vinagrette was too harsh for me. I had forgotten to ask for ""dressing on the side"" as I usually do, but it came that way. I started to ask for another dressing, but combo of flavors in salad really didn't need the dressing, so I ate it without. manager heard it was our first visit, came over to ask us how everything was, then also told us about free app offer and gave us a coupon for another small plate to use next visit. server was very attentive and friendly and and dishes were cleared and drinks refilled promptly. lunch special of 7"" pizza and soup or salad was $10.95 and soup sammie and soup salad combos offered for $1 or $2 less. apps $4-$7. LOTS on the menu, pastas looked and smelled great and portion sizes looked split-able. but we confined ourselves to the lunch menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-antonio-2?start=20

We ordered the thin crust meat cravers and Alfredo with chicken pasta. We did have trouble deciding what to order but boy are we glad we ordered what we did. Meat cravers was spicy with good bite from the oven roasted dough. Pasta was not too rich and the chicken could have been a bigger portion but other than that we are very happy with our visit.

We came in after the lunch rush. Service was great and the food was FABULOUS!!! We ordered a caramelized peach salad (full not half) and a California Club pizza and split both between us. The salad was one of the best I've had anywhere. It featured my usual faves, like cranberries, pecans and Gorgonzola, but the peaches & the vinaigrette really made it pop. I highly recommend trying it. The pizza was great. Really just an addition to the salad, but held its own nonetheless especially with the bacon... And the crust... Seriously makes my mouth water just thinking about it. Not oily or greasy at all.. Just a REAL pizza dough flavor cooked perfectly. It was great! We finished it off with the chocolate suflee  and strawberry shortcake, both with ice cream... Maybe a bit too much for a hot day, but whatever, they were both amazing.

Every time I come here I always get the California Club Pizza, it has fresh lettuce, avocados, and grilled chicken on top. Very good & healthy! We got the potstickers w/ sweet and sour sauce for appetizers, but it was soggy and small. The location is great, after dinner or lunch you can walk around Quarry Market because they have some amazing stores (Borders, get some ice cream at Amy's, Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works), or you can watch a movie because there's a movie theater in the same area.

I have been to CPK, 3x in the last ten days, (once here while visiting family) and twice recently in Braintree, MA.

I have to say our server Everett rocked so we left him a little extra $. He was really great and so was the hostess, who didn't have our name, even though I called ahead and there was a long wait.. she sat us in less than10 min.. rockstar.

Tamara N.,"San Antonio, TX",107,116,188,4.0,7/20/2010,"We are so excited that CPK has arrived at Alamo Quarry Market!!! We went Monday night, which happened to be the night that 100% of the proceeds were going to CASA. I was very impressed with that. It was extremely busy and we were told it would be about a 30 minute wait. We waited about 20 minutes and were seated by a very pleasant hostess. We ordered the Avacado Club Eggrolls for an appetizer and they were so freaking AMAZING. ""A fusion of East and West with fresh avacado, chicken, tomato, Monterey Jack cheese and applewood smoked bacon, hand-wrapped in a crispy wonton roll. Served with homemade ranchito sauce and our homemade herb ranch dressing."" The two dipping sauces that accompanied the dish were a perfect compliment but I could have put anything on those eggrolls and still thought they were the BEST appetizer EVER. The one downer to evening was that there were four of us that ordered one pizza each and only three were brought to the table. Apparently the waiter forgot to ring up one of the Sicilian pizzas. My husband and youngest son both ordered the Sicilian and when he delivered the ONE Sicilian to the table he gave it to my husband and not my son. That really annoyed the MOMMY in me. My husband, of course shared his with my son while they waited for the other one to come out. I had the Hawaiian, which was OK but I was still dreaming of those darn eggrolls and it paled in comparison. My oldest son ordered the Chipotle Chicken and his description was ""AMAZING"". My husband also ordered the Red Sangria and he says it is ""Good, Very Good"". I also ordered the Margarini which was GREAT.  We finished our pizzas and there was no sight of the missing fourth pizza so we just ask the waiter to remove it from our tab. The Manager came over and apologized and later the General Manager came over to be sure the pizza was removed from the tab and offered us a card for a FREE Entree and drink on our next visit. That won me over. After all, we all make mistakes. The prompt attention to make up for the mistake once it was brought to the Manager's attention, was very impressive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-antonio-2?start=60
Kat L.,"San Antonio, TX",37,18,1,3.0,12/25/2012,"My initial visits to this restaurant got me addicted to two or three particular menu items, including a sweet/spicy shrimp appetizer, a 'Mediterranean small plate that included humus, a cucumber/tomato salad and Feta in olive oil with several small slices of pita bread. Sound delicious? They were and they are no more! The menu changed! I still go in hopes that they might bring the shrimp back and because they have a delicious and (shudder) healthy Shrimp Scampi and Zucchini fettuccine bowl that is really really good!!

Way, way back when I used to live in Kentucky my mom and I used to visit CPK for one thing, and one thing only: The CPK Cobb Salad. This is a serious meal. Though it's been nearly a decade since those days, I recently was able to enjoy one again and it was just delicious! They start with a bed of lettuce (revolutionary, I know) and add some basil. Just enough to give this fresh, delicious flavor, not so much to make it taste like a basil salad. Then, they add some veggies, bacon, blue cheese, chicken, egg, all the fixin's. But, my favorite topping is the cubed pickled beets. Oh my goodness. Great touch. And mix it all together with some of their CPK Ranch dressing, you have a real winner of a dinner. Or lunch, as it were. This location in the Quarry is convenient and still fairly new. All is clean and shiny and it looks just like every other CPK. The staff was friendly, and fast, which is always a plus during a busy lunch, and they have really revamped the menu since 10 years ago when I used to eat it in KY.

It could have used just a bit more flavor it was still very good. For our main course, we decided to share one of their pizzas since it's what they're known for and the server suggested the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken pizza since she said it's their signature dish. We opted for that but ordered it without the onions since we're both not big fans of red onions and added bacon. I was hesitant at first on adding the bacon since the pizza has pineapple on it but the server assured me that we would not be disappointed with the combination of flavors. Well, big points for that server because our pizza was delicious and it was just enough for both of us. My mom is not a big pizza fan but she really loved this pizza and the combination of salty and sweet was perfect.

Big what a mistake, we started with the artichoke dip which we found to be inedible, it was seriously the worst artichoke dip we'd ever had . Next we had the bbq pizza and a pepperoni pizza, the pizza seemed to be tolerable at least the pepperoni one was the bbq one was terrible, the bbq sauce just doesn't work on a pizza , it's like do want be a pizza or do you want to be bbq pick one . At this point we are two slices in a we both said to each other, I think their frozen store bought pizza is better and yeah it is ! This is not the place if you want good pizza , should have went to Grimaldis across the street. Now here's what really brought me to my one star rating , who am I kidding I would have been one star regardless but here it is , minutes after taking our order my waiter walks over with a broom and dust pan , does not use it ! Sets it down literally across from where we are eat nasty artichoke dip and walks away ! It's stayed there the entire meal ! Several employees walked by it but none touch it !

Jacqueline J.,"San Antonio, United States",439,168,935,4.0,17/11/2015,"The Family and I enjoyed CPK as part of the Annual Parade of Veterans that flocked to neighboring eateries as they honored our Valor and Service. Last year I heard there was over a 2 hour wait so after the family and I polished off our Free pancakes at IHOP, we rolled on over to the Quarry to walk off the bacon and eggs. Luckily the rain that was threatening to ruin our Veteran's Meal held off and we pulled up to an empty CPK around 1015.  We peeped in and saw workers scurrying by as I'm sure they knew the Veteran's and Active Duty Crowd would be pouring in as the doors were unlocked.  After walking around window shopping for 30 or so minutes, the family and I returned to roughly a 3 person line that was starting to grow by the second.  We hopped in line and within ten minutes were seated by a gracious host and an attentive waiter. The Sister and I shared a BBQ Pizza and donated her Hawaiian Pizza to the nieces who happily gobbled up and pulled apart their ham and pineapples meal.. The brother n law ate a rather large salad, which I'm surprised he was able to finish after all the pancakes we had consumed that morning.  The waiter was quick and within minutes every seat in the establishment was full.  I can't say it's worth waiting 2 hours in line but this AF Veteran and Army Soldier along with her family enjoyed yet another Free Meal on Veteran's day. I appreciate the frozen entrees in the store but was elated to share this Day and  freshly baked meal with the family. Side Note ~ The restaurant was awesome in honoring our service but did not check our IDs.  I hope that scrupulous people who like to impose as military members do not take advantage of this day and ruin for those serving. It is used to honor the thousands across the nation that have served and are currently serving.  Thank you Again CPK. The Pizza was Great and made for an awesome midnight snack.

Sarah J.,"San Antonio, United States",96,247,213,4.0,29/12/2016,"CPK has long been a favorite dinner spot for me, and one of the few chains I have on my frequent-customer list. I just love their small plates and I always order a thin crust Hawaiian pizza with extra pineapples. The pizza is fresh made and wood fired in their open kitchen for you to watch. Dessert menu is worth a look too! My husband isn't really a big fan, so it's not something we do as often as I'd like. I swear it's because it had California in the name, and it drives him crazy when I sit there and talk about ""when I used to live in California..."" He ate up half that pizza though! (He's not usually a big eater.) On that note, if you don't have a large appetite, order one pizza to share. It's enough for 2 people of you aren't overly hungry or if you're adding an appetizer as well.  I miss going to the Quarry location because there was a server there I loved, an older gentleman I think of Polish decent. He was always the perfect customer service rep and should be the face of that company! Maybe I'll stop back in and see if he's still there one day!

Now on customer service.  Macie, our server was very nice.  She seemed to really go out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed.  My friend ordered a Mojito while I ordered the Strawberry Mango, however, our server brought us water later on without us even ordering it.  I thought that was very thoughtful of her.  That is what makes a server stand out, little things such as the thoughtfulness of the needs of their customers without the customers even asking.   I would recommend others to come check out California Pizza Kitchen at this location for sure.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-antonio-2

Tami S.,"San Antonio, United States",34,103,79,4.0,12/3/2015,"good food and service... I had seen the note on yelp about free small plate offer and had signed up in advance of visit. we ordered, including small plate for coupon offer. our waiter made a point of coming back by to let us know about the offer so we could get the item for free. LOVE that! I like when the staff informs you of offer sir promotions. there on spring break with hubbie, mom-in-law and sons ages 13 and 18. kids both ordered same lunch special: bbq chicken pizza and potato soup. adults all ordered same pizza: shaved mushroom and spinach and hubbie and mom had Sedona tortilla soup while I opted for the spinach and quinoa salad. free app was bianco flatbread. flatbread was good and we each had a slice. blue cheese is a little strong if you aren't used to it. but even kids ate it without complaint. it was tasty and flatbread wasn't too thin or hard. both pizza types were very good, although mushroom pizzas all seemed to have fillings at center with very WIDE crusts. I don't like onions - red onions came on bbq chicken pizza. but when I snagged a bite of my son's I found I preferred the onions on it - nice balance of flavors. mushroom pizza was good, just enough cheese, mushroom flavors came through. crust was yummy! potato soup was rich but good. Sedona tortilla was thick and creamy and flavor reminded me of cheese enchiladas. my salad was great, nice, big and FRESH! but the champagne vinagrette was too harsh for me. I had forgotten to ask for ""dressing on the side"" as I usually do, but it came that way. I started to ask for another dressing, but combo of flavors in salad really didn't need the dressing, so I ate it without. manager heard it was our first visit, came over to ask us how everything was, then also told us about free app offer and gave us a coupon for another small plate to use next visit. server was very attentive and friendly and and dishes were cleared and drinks refilled promptly. lunch special of 7"" pizza and soup or salad was $10.95 and soup sammie and soup salad combos offered for $1 or $2 less. apps $4-$7. LOTS on the menu, pastas looked and smelled great and portion sizes looked split-able. but we confined ourselves to the lunch menu.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-antonio-2?start=20

We ordered the thin crust meat cravers and Alfredo with chicken pasta. We did have trouble deciding what to order but boy are we glad we ordered what we did. Meat cravers was spicy with good bite from the oven roasted dough. Pasta was not too rich and the chicken could have been a bigger portion but other than that we are very happy with our visit.

We came in after the lunch rush. Service was great and the food was FABULOUS!!! We ordered a caramelized peach salad (full not half) and a California Club pizza and split both between us. The salad was one of the best I've had anywhere. It featured my usual faves, like cranberries, pecans and Gorgonzola, but the peaches & the vinaigrette really made it pop. I highly recommend trying it. The pizza was great. Really just an addition to the salad, but held its own nonetheless especially with the bacon... And the crust... Seriously makes my mouth water just thinking about it. Not oily or greasy at all.. Just a REAL pizza dough flavor cooked perfectly. It was great! We finished it off with the chocolate suflee  and strawberry shortcake, both with ice cream... Maybe a bit too much for a hot day, but whatever, they were both amazing.

Every time I come here I always get the California Club Pizza, it has fresh lettuce, avocados, and grilled chicken on top. Very good & healthy! We got the potstickers w/ sweet and sour sauce for appetizers, but it was soggy and small. The location is great, after dinner or lunch you can walk around Quarry Market because they have some amazing stores (Borders, get some ice cream at Amy's, Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works), or you can watch a movie because there's a movie theater in the same area.  The employees were friendly, once we walked in they immediately greeted us, & the waiters and waitresses were really friendly, our waitress was Asian & she was from Northern California, like me :)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-antonio-2?start=20

I have been to CPK, 3x in the last ten days, (once here while visiting family) and twice recently in Braintree, MA. San Antonio, Quarry peeps-- hands down this location just did a fabulous job, with 2 toddlers, 4 adults and one child, getting the food, dealing with strewn crayons, straw wrappers and being quick on the orders, and cleaning the plate. I have to say our server Everett rocked so we left him a little extra $. He was really great and so was the hostess, who didn't have our name, even though I called ahead and there was a long wait.. she sat us in less than10 min.. rockstar. This is a great place to go with kids.. lots of good choices (not just pizza) for kids.

Way, way back when I used to live in Kentucky my mom and I used to visit CPK for one thing, and one thing only: The CPK Cobb Salad. This is a serious meal. Though it's been nearly a decade since those days, I recently was able to enjoy one again and it was just delicious! They start with a bed of lettuce (revolutionary, I know) and add some basil. Just enough to give this fresh, delicious flavor, not so much to make it taste like a basil salad. Then, they add some veggies, bacon, blue cheese, chicken, egg, all the fixin's. But, my favorite topping is the cubed pickled beets. Oh my goodness. Great touch. And mix it all together with some of their CPK Ranch dressing, you have a real winner of a dinner. Or lunch, as it were. This location in the Quarry is convenient and still fairly new. All is clean and shiny and it looks just like every other CPK. The staff was friendly, and fast, which is always a plus during a busy lunch, and they have really revamped the menu since 10 years ago when I used to eat it in KY.

It could have used just a bit more flavor it was still very good. For our main course, we decided to share one of their pizzas since it's what they're known for and the server suggested the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken pizza since she said it's their signature dish. We opted for that but ordered it without the onions since we're both not big fans of red onions and added bacon. I was hesitant at first on adding the bacon since the pizza has pineapple on it but the server assured me that we would not be disappointed with the combination of flavors. Well, big points for that server because our pizza was delicious and it was just enough for both of us.

Tamara N.,"San Antonio, United States",107,116,188,4.0,20/7/2010,"We are so excited that CPK has arrived at Alamo Quarry Market!!! We went Monday night, which happened to be the night that 100% of the proceeds were going to CASA. I was very impressed with that. It was extremely busy and we were told it would be about a 30 minute wait. We waited about 20 minutes and were seated by a very pleasant hostess. We ordered the Avacado Club Eggrolls for an appetizer and they were so freaking AMAZING. ""A fusion of East and West with fresh avacado, chicken, tomato, Monterey Jack cheese and applewood smoked bacon, hand-wrapped in a crispy wonton roll. Served with homemade ranchito sauce and our homemade herb ranch dressing."" The two dipping sauces that accompanied the dish were a perfect compliment but I could have put anything on those eggrolls and still thought they were the BEST appetizer EVER. The one downer to evening was that there were four of us that ordered one pizza each and only three were brought to the table. Apparently the waiter forgot to ring up one of the Sicilian pizzas. My husband and youngest son both ordered the Sicilian and when he delivered the ONE Sicilian to the table he gave it to my husband and not my son. That really annoyed the MOMMY in me. My husband, of course shared his with my son while they waited for the other one to come out. I had the Hawaiian, which was OK but I was still dreaming of those darn eggrolls and it paled in comparison. My oldest son ordered the Chipotle Chicken and his description was ""AMAZING"". My husband also ordered the Red Sangria and he says it is ""Good, Very Good"". I also ordered the Margarini which was GREAT.  We finished our pizzas and there was no sight of the missing fourth pizza so we just ask the waiter to remove it from our tab. The Manager came over and apologized and later the General Manager came over to be sure the pizza was removed from the tab and offered us a card for a FREE Entree and drink on our next visit. That won me over. After all, we all make mistakes. The prompt attention to make up for the mistake once it was brought to the Manager's attention, was very impressive.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-antonio-2?start=60
