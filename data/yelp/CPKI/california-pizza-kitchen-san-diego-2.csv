Janelle O.,"Camarillo, CA",49,86,1,4.0,1/1/2018,"I got a gift card for CPK, so I tried them out this week. I didn't know they had pasta, sandwiches and entrees, so that was a nice surprise.  I ordered a 5 cheese & fresh tomato pizza and the buffalo cauliflower appetizer. Man that cauliflower was spicy, but good! Pizza was fine.  Take out is easy to do- I called ahead and waited a few minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2
Hayley A.,"San Diego, CA",68,20,16,1.0,12/20/2017,What has happened to CPK? I ordered a Waldorf salad (half size) which was $13! Yikes! There was barely any lettuce in it at all and so many apples and grapes. So basically I ordered the worlds smallest fruit salad for $13. So I wondered what a full size salad cost = $16.29.  I'm pretty sure I will never return to a cpk again. There are so many other places to grab a pizza and salad for a decent price.  I wish I took a pic of that fruit salad - it was so depressing in its little to go container.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2
Annie V.,"San Diego, CA",0,19,,1.0,9/16/2017,"Placed a To Go order to be picked up and as I was driving up I get a call saying the item is seasonal and they no longer carry it. Do I want to cancel my order? I'm sitting in the parking lot... I walk in to talk to them and they offer the option to order something else and wait. That's it. I speak to the manager and explain I took the time to call, drive down and this is frustrating. Now I'm waiting. She agreed and said they would hurry AND WALKED AWAY while another person took my money. So here I sit. Waiting in a crowd of people for something I really didn't want that I'm paying for. I would NOT recommend this place. UPDATE:  Don't order the Cobb Salad!  The bacon was old and rubbery. There were 3 shavings of chicken bits. The rest was the REALLY BITTER white center portion of iceberg lettuce that you would not eat.  I am so disappointed that I followed through after being treated poorly, paid for a meal I didn't want and brought home a terrible ""dinner"" after a long day of work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2

They are dog friendly (on the patio) and the service is great. We had Michele today and she was the sweetest! She gave us great service and she loved our dog, so that was a plus too! The food here is amazing to say the least. Today I got tke cucumber Revitalizer beverage and it was SO GOOD and super refreshing! They are not complimentary refills though - FYI. I got 2 because they were so good. Their spicy cauliflower appetizer is what I crave the most!

Arnel D.,"San Diego, CA",1572,1907,6799,5.0,9/6/2017,"Its been years since I've last been to a CPK, yet alone this particular location. I was very surprised at how delicious their food was.  My wife and I enjoyed a small salad, the buffalo cauliflower and sausage pizza.  All were yummy and filling. It was great being able to come in, be seated and served in less than 30 minutes.   The place wasn't too busy and our server was also the bartender.  I was worried at first that my wife and I wouldn't get good service. I was wrong.  Amanda was excellent.  Topping off our drinks and clearing out plates, etc.  I'll be back again for sure.  Maybe during Sunday Funday to watch some football and throwback a few drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2
Greg B.,"San Diego, CA",74,298,200,4.0,6/10/2017,"This place isn't a regular in my rotation but it is pretty good nevertheless.  With CPK you kinda know what you're gonna get: an extensive menu littered with all kinds of glorious options to choose from in a very amiable atmosphere and chances are good that you'll probably have a great time.  On my last visit I had one of their supreme pizzas and it was solid. Not on of the best things I've ever had but I enjoyed every bite. Their sandwiches are surprisingly enjoyable and the service is always friendly. It's not always on my agenda to go here, but when I do I find myself satisfied.

Their pita bread is delicious and the pizza was great as well. They messed up my boyfriends order but they immediately made him a new pizza for free.

Daniel L.,"San Diego, CA",301,112,86,5.0,10/31/2017,This is one of my favorite pizza places of all time. You can't go wrong with anything here but def try adding an egg on your pizza as it really brings out the flavor. If you decide to get salad the bbq chicken salad is literally my favorite salad ever. Pro tip order the pita bread here it's only a dollar you get a bunch of it and it's as delicious as pizza. My last experience here they got my pizza order completely wrong and not only did they change they redo it they let me keep the original pizza for free. If you're looking for some great customer service I don't think you can go wrong with this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2

M P.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,3.0,12/18/2017,"I've been to the Carmel Mt. CPK many times and mostly it is a fine and delicious experience.  The servers are always friendly and aim to please.   I will continue to patronize this CPK - because there are times when I absolutely must have a particular menu item and because it's only 5 minutes from home. There are two issues that irk me, however. They have discontinued the Moroccan Salad and the Chinese Chicken Salad.  Why??!!!! And.  Their rewards program leaves much to be desired.  Not only does just ONE person receive rewards credit from a party of two or more at the table - somehow this seems odd and unfair - but twice to date the server has assured us that the check amount would be posted to the rewards account, but that was not the case.  Nothing was posted. CPK almost never has ""specials"" and discounts, and I was hoping that the rewards deal would give a bit of a break.  It seems that this is not necessarily the case.  They could do better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2
Emily H.,"San Diego, CA",3,55,150,3.0,9/18/2017,I'd give it more stars but for a small reg mozzarella cheese pizza and a small Italian chopped salad it was almost $30! That's way too much sorry. The salad has a good dressing the only reason I ordered it lol. The pizza was good and thinly sliced-I'd go back but I'd bring a friend to split it since it was too pricey for one person for lunch.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2
Am E.,"San Diego, CA",9,147,20,2.0,4/18/2017,"We ordered food to go online, picked it up, came home and were very disappointed. The food was yummy, but there were a couple mishaps.  First, I don't think they pay attention to the ""Special Requests"" section when you order online. If you're not going to pay attention or acknowledge it, don't give us that option! We both requested additional items that were not honored.  Second, there was a GRAPE in my husband's Cesar dressing for his salad. That is not okay. Food preparation training needs to be addressed with whoever prepares the food there. It makes me wonder what else they do behind closed doors. CPK used to be my favorite place to eat, but I'm finding myself disliking it the more I eat it. Sadly, I would not recommend it to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2

Margaret D.,"San Diego, CA",130,123,137,1.0,11/14/2017,"For some reason this was a bad lunch choice all around.  The parking lot was being re-paved surrounding this restaurant.  I ended up having to park across a very busy street and walk to the restaurant.  There was a large lunch crowd and we had to wait fifteen minutes to be seated.  We were told this up front and we were ok with the wait since our car was so far away.  We were finally seated at a nice booth and had our drinks served promptly.  We started with an appetizer, the white corn guacamole and chips for $5.  When it arrived my lunch companion and I were both hugely disappointed as it was a one cup serving of some cubed avocado, but it mostly consisted of corn and beans.  There was so much filler and barely any guacamole that we really felt ripped off.  Also there was a handful of chips, I think this could have been a much bigger serving.  We then split the Thai Chicken pizza, which was not as tasty as I imagined it would be.  There wasn't much chicken on there and we were both still hungry and so we rolled the dice to see if the dessert would bring some happiness to our lunch.  We ordered the Salted Carmel Pudding since most of the other desserts charged extra for the ice cream that was pictured in the desserts and when you added up the price we didn't think ordering them made much sense.  When our salted carmel pudding arrived with two spoons we laughed because the glass dish you could see there was about an inch of pudding in the glass and the rest was filled with whipped cream.  After dessert my friend and I decided that we would never come back to California Pizza Kitchen again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2

We weren't immediately greeted and had to wait for someone to seat us but my restaurant experience turned around when Kendall seated us. I explained how CPK had the asparagus spinach spaghettini and had taken it off the menu. If it wasn't for my friend, I wouldn't have come in. Kendall said that they were able to make my favorite dish. She was so pleasant and understanding. She was the perfect server and moving forward, I would come to this CPK even if they couldn't make this dish. All because of Kendall. What an asset to CPK.

Amy M.,"San Diego, CA",4,210,45,1.0,12/31/2016,"Wow, how does this place stay in business? I'm going to assume it is 100% by having the word ""California"" in the title giving that old hometown pride feeling of nostalgia or some crap. Stopped by today with Wee One and my brother and sister-in-law visiting from out of state. We decided to come here because ""It has California in the name, it has to be the legit California experience"".   We started with the ""small plate"" fried Mac and cheese and they aren't kidding about the small. It is literally four balls, about half the size of a golf ball for $5. I wouldn't pay $1.25 each for an actual golfball, let alone something half the size of a golf ball that is just going to only stay with me for the next day, tops. So I ordered the $14 Thai chicken pizza, Brother had the $14 barbecue chicken sandwich, Sis-in-law had the $14 classic crispy chicken sandwich, Wee One had the $5.50 kids Hawaiian Pizza, and I grabbed a $14 cheese and tomato pizza home for Hubs. The Thai chicken pizza had very little peanut sauce so it was very dry, had even less chicken, and had a mountain of carrots, bean sprouts and scallions. I like vegetable as much as the next person (and probably more) but when it is 90% of the pizza, it is a bit ridiculous. And it is definitely something you can eat on your own. The BBQ chicken sandwich did not taste like Bbq at all. It was mushy chicken and even mushier fried onions. Both sandwiches decided to have the farmers market soup as a side and it was awful. The flavor was very similar to the spicy chowder type soups they sell in cans at the supermarket. It had chunks of raw veggies (they claimed to be roasted, but I am not buying that...) and a ""drizzle"" of olive oil on top that would probably be more adequately described as an ""oil spill/ecological disaster"" of olive oil on top. Seriously, we thought BP had been through the kitchens (Too soon?). The crispy chicken had a tiny piece of chicken in a huge square roll (because they think chicken is square?) so only the middle had chicken in it. Most of the sanwiches was just dry bread with lettuce and a ton of mayo oozing everywhere (See picture). Wee One's kid-sized pizza was the most appropriately priced but clearly the people who designed the kids menu items have no idea what ACTUALLY children are like. The ham was thinly sliced, but it was in huge pieces so W.O. kept choking on it. I had the take all the pieces off, tear them into edible non-choky chunks and then put them back on. The pineapple was also super huge chunks that had to be torn into smaller pieces for kid-sized mouths. The pineapple had a lot of the outer bits still on it like when you don't cut enough of the rind off, which is a bit irritating in a pizza. W.O. also asked for a refill on his chocolate milk and had to keep waiting and waiting. Not sure why it took 5 minutes to get a refill on chocolate milk when our server came up twice to say ""the chocolate milk will be right up"". The take home pizza was fine with the proportions and flavors, but still really expensive for a dinner plate-sized pizza. All together, including tip, this meal came to $80!!! Overall, I think California should petition to have the name changed so this restaurant doesn't sully California's name. I will never be returning to this place when the pizza at Little Caesars tasted similar to this ""gourmet"" crap and was twice the size for a third of the price. And doesn't choke toddlers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2

Chelsea S.,"Orange, CA",45,287,,3.0,3/5/2016,"I think the three stars say it all, the food is good, but nothing that makes you cry tears of joy. I've never liked the pizza here (yes, I said it!) so I decided to try the jambalaya fettuccine. Some of the noodles were a bit al dente for my taste, but the biggest issue was that the noodles weren't cooked evenly. Some were undercooked, some weren't. It was sort of an emotional roller coaster for my mouth because I never knew what I was going to get. The pasta wasn't quite as seasoned as I hoped, but the saving grace was the chorizo. Granted, I've never encountered under seasoned chorizo ANYwhere, but it was the shining star of the dish. Would I come here again? Sure, I guess. The location is convenient, and my friends/family seem to like it more than I do. But I certainly wouldn't go out of my way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2?start=40

I tried the roasted veggie salad and it was very delicious.  The veggies were nicely grilled, I love hot veggies on a salad.  I had 2 different types on dressings on the side and the half is a really good sized portion.  My coworker with me enjoyed her BBQ chicken pizza. Daniel was our server and he was great, he could see we were on a quick lunch break and got us in and out.  Very friendly and overall a great server! I do feel CPK is a little expensive, I know they raised their prices a few years ago and $16 for a salad and a diet coke is a little more than what I wanna pay at lunchtime but it's good. My only negative, I asked for a diet coke and received a diet Pepsi, I'm not a fan of diet Pepsi and wish restaurants would tell you it's Pepsi when you order.  This is not anything against our server or CPK, it's just the norm in restaurants, us diet coke addicts are very picky :) I of course will definitely be back for more great food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2?start=40

Jeff L.,"Poway, CA",160,60,52,5.0,2/11/2016,"The restaurant business is a tough business. There are so many elements that are out of the restaurant managers hands. Tonight, we experienced one of those ""tough"" elements. Earlier in the week, I made a reservation for 12 for 6pm. When we arrived at 6pm we were told we were just waiting for some patrons that had already paid to leave. 6:10....6:15....6:35...FINALLY, we were seated not at the table we were waiting for but another one in the rear corner.  It's a ""tough"" business because you can't simply ask guests to leave their table because another party is waiting. What made it difficult for me was the fact that we made reservations for 6pm, we had someone that needed to leave at 7 and most importantly it was a birthday celebration. I could sense that the manager tonight wanted to make things right and was apologetic for the situation. Shortly after we sat, we've received multiple appetizers for the entire table in inconvenience for our wait. I really appreciated the gesture and hope that anyone who reads this, will treat all people with kindness and patience.  Overall, we had a great birthday celebration, everyone loved their food, and the manager and our server were truly exceptionally! Thank you to the manager and waiter. I wish I caught their names!

Kenna H.,"Sunnyvale, CA",271,325,865,4.0,1/2/2015,"The portions at this place have definitely shrunk - or whoever made our food the other night was being skimpy.  I've been here many times and ordered the same things from a small subset of my favorites, and noticed a change the last time I went! I always order the thai crunch salad, and BBQ chicken pizza - I think some of the best things on the menu.  Ever since I discovered the thai crunch salad I've ordered it every time I've been here.  It has edamame, peanuts, and crispy noodles in it.  Definitely a family favorite. Only had dessert once here, but it was amazing!  A really buttery pound cake with some very thick, decadent vanilla ice cream on top.  The cake was warm and the ice cream melted over the top - like heaven!  Enough to share with a few people (especially since the amount of butter in it is more than enough for a few people). Another nice thing about CPK is how empty it can be!  This could be a bad sign - but it was perfect the last time because we had tried 2 other restaurants before arriving at CPK and could get seated quickly.

Service sucked and we were also not impressed with the food this time. Now that my baby is eating restaurant food we started ordering kid meals when we go out. We went there on a Sunday little past the regular lunch hour (maybe around 1:45pm). First the service: We were seated by the hostess and sat there for maybe like 10+ minutes before I asked some random server/supervisor that we want to order some food (my daughter was hungry). He asked if anyone showed up to greet and take our order, I said no they did not. That guy talked to a couple of ladies at the billing desk a table away from mine, one of those ladies was our server. Our server was neither smiling nor welcoming (not sure if it was because we asked for someone to take our order instead of waiting indefinitely). She seemed overworked (which is usually the trend we noticed at CPK) and too busy to greet and make proper eye contact. I ordered kids Mac&Cheese, water and the usual bread they serve. I requested the kids meal be brought out ASAP. I said I'll order the entree's when she brings the M&C out. We got water immediately and bread in a short while but it was a while before the M&C was out. Now the food: Turns out Mac & Cheese (on the kids menu) sucks at CPK!! It was not the traditional or classic Macaroni, they made it with the fusilli (thick curly pasta). Pasta was half cooked and absolutely dry with no visible cream or cheese. This is what you serve for kids? We tried to feed that dry half cooked pasta to my daughter but she did not like it.  After a little while we could get hold of our server and I asked for extra cheese and cream to be brought out, which took a while again to come out.

Luckily, I decided to make a reservation about an hour and some beforehand so our wait was 20 minutes.  The service was friendly and somewhat efficient. Understandably, it was busy so it took a while for our food to come out, but not bad. Food quality, nothing special but good.  Price wise, it's definitely $$.

Tanya L.,"Carmel Valley, San Diego, CA",229,24,37,5.0,3/11/2014,"CPK! Love, love, love many things about this place. If you love cobb salad, this is the best it's gonna get.  Take the beets on, they're good for you. Another salad winner is the roasted veggie. Add on the salmon or chicken and eat this up. My son loves the thin crusted sicilian. What can I say? He's a meat eater. The pasta is not too shabby either.  Tequila fettuccine or pesto cream penne with sun-dried tomatoes keeps me coming back for more...yum yum yum! The butter cake is divine and should be shared with a loved one!  The salted caramel is tasty too, you're gonna want to steal one or two spoonfuls of this heaven. Here's a few tips to enjoy your experience. 1) Eat off hours.  Yeah it gets packed at dinner, so if you need your CPK fix eat an early dinner at 4. 2) If you have a small party of 2 and it's packed, jump at the seats on the bar.  The service is faster and better! 3) It's CPK. The P stands for Pizza.  If you want Mexican carnitas or chile relleno, you should probably head over to a Mexican restaurant. If the customer is always right, then be the right customer!

Elle J.,"San Diego, CA",219,597,614,3.0,2/12/2014,"This is a review of their catering. I think ""catering"" is actually a fancy name for large order. I like that you can do everything online. That is life saving for me because I often do things last minute, I like looking things over before I put in an order, and I sorta hate talking on the phone. I have no idea when or why this became a part of who I am but nowadays I only talk to people who cannot text. Hate the phone otherwise. Anyway I put my order in early in the morning. I showed up to get my order and was told they were running late. Which is fine I guess but I was told in a way that made it seem like it could be 5 mins late or 30. Usually it would be no big deal, but when I am bringing food to a hungry account with a limited time to feed them and do my thang I get a little anxious.  In all they were about ten to 15 mins late no biggie. Still if you need an order on time then make sure you put it in for pick up early. I got a large pasta order. It leaked all over. Sorta lame because I took great care in delivering it. The food was good and I think you get about what you pay for. I like that they include two huge salads. The desert plate is just cookies and brownies. Nothing to get hyped over. My account enjoyed the food. They did not enjoy the mess it made. I would think twice before getting an order from here again.  Also I hate the $2 cans of soda. Last, when they helped me get the food to my car the service improved. I think maybe they were slammed.

The lettuce wraps had no sauce with them, along with only 2 servings in the to go package when there is 5 pieces of bib lettuce. No sauce with the avocado egg rolls.

My family and I had dinner last night at CPK on Carmel Mountain Road. I got there around 6pm.  Asked for a table for 3.  A gentleman walked me all the way to the very end, to a table in the very far right corner where you are covered and its very private.  I asked to be moved to the main area and to be around people.  He took me over to a booth that was empty, but needed to be cleaned, as dirty dishes were still on the table. I sat down. Someone came over and took the dirty dishes away.   Our waiter came over and asked me for my drink order.  I asked him to please have someone wipe the table as it was used by someone before me and had dirty forks and dishes on it.  Here is the KICKER!!! He bend down and started looking at the table.  He was actually looking to see if the table was dirty!!! Really?  Anyhow, he came back with a towel.  Wiped it 1/2 way in the middle. Then comes the ordering part.  We ordered 1) one pea soup 2) one tortilla soup, one appetizer, a salad to split and one entree.  HERE IS HOW THIS WORKED: GOT THE APPETIZER.  NO ONE BOTHERED TO BRING US PLATES OR SILVERWARE.  WAITED FOR THAT. NEXT, 10 MINUTES LATER, CAME THE SALAD AND ENTREE.  NEVER GOT OUR SOUPS.

The tacos were ok, there are two on a plate so if you want to share with more people, you'll need to order more.  I don't know what it was about it that just didn't do it for me, but my mom seemed to really like them.  I don't eat Jambalaya (go on, gasp...), but Mom seemed to like it.  It is a huge portion, there is some in our fridge right now.  And they serve theirs with pasta, not rice.  The pizza... DELICIOUS!  Loved it and it hit the spot.  It just had lovely flavour... the chicken, the salsa... and the cilantro lime cream sauce was a great touch!  We ate it all... no left overs :). We did take a cheeky dessert home.  We ordered the Tiramisu, which we ate a couple hours later.  Mom didn't really like it, she said it tasted boozy...

To my surprise, it seemed like everyone around us was also ordering the same thing.  Now, I like my pizza pretty standard with tomato sauce, unless Im eating a white pizza.  But the tangy BBQ sauce along with the chicken was pretty dang tasty!  I can see how this can be a crave.   Pricing was cheaper than what I expected so this was a huge plus.  This CPK was very clean and service was on point.   Definitely going to explore CPK as an option in the future....

Accommodation: it has become the hub of family gatherings with big groups of kids (teams, etc). and as expected, boisterous, loud combo of kids squealing + adult laughters just fills the air. Service: it depends on who you get. Hope a veteran wait staff will get your order as it will be efficient and precise, drinks filled automatically.

This was stop number six on my boyfriend's Veteran's Day free meal circuit. We arrived around 4:45 and had a 20 minute wait for a table.  As I had been snacking at all the previous restaurants, I wanted something light and decided to try the Crispy Mac and Cheese off the small plates menu. Unfortunately, this dish was not what I was expecting. I thought it would be a small bowl of mac and cheese with the panko crust on the top for a bit of crunch. I didn't expect it to be fried mac and cheese bites. There was way too much breading and not enough mac and cheese. In fact, the bites seemed rather dry and desperately needed more cheese sauce. I managed to eat one before being overwhelmed by the breading and decided to get the rest to go for my boyfriend to eat. At least the dish was under $4 but it wasn't even worth that. My boyfriend, however, loved his complimentary for Veteran's Day pear and gorgonzola pizza.

When entering we were greeted by a smiling Hostess who sat us immediately and informed us that our waitress was a little busy, but she asked us for our drink orders. Our waitresses name was Brooke, I think, and she was lovely, helping us decide what we should drink and got our orders in very quickly.  We could tell she was busy but she was still so attentive and got us what we needed, when we needed it.

I decided to try something new for Veteran's Day (I could get a free pizza for being in the National Guard) and ordered the Pear and Gorgonzola thin crust pizza. Although I was a little weary of the pears because I'm not usually a fan of fruit on pizza but they weren't too overpowering and they complemented the pizza well. When the pizza arrived, it looked like a pizza with a salad on top. This surprised me but the salad was a touch and I gobbled up the arugula with gorgonzola salad quickly. After I finished my surprise salad, I started on the delicious pizza. Along with the pear, it was topped with caramelized onions, hazelnuts and gorgonzola. All the flavors combined perfectly to make a wonderful pizza that I highly recommend.

Ken W.,"San Diego, CA",63,193,158,2.0,6/22/2013,"I haven't been here in years, but the last time I was here I remembered it being pretty good. I had a gift card to this place, so I figured I would try it out again, this time for takeout. I ordered online, and there was a deal for a free small plate registering for their loyalty program. I registered and printed out the offer. When I got there, there were two people in front of me and one takeout register. The first person was doing a bunch of scratchers with the cashier for 5 minutes. The 2nd person had all these questions about the loyalty program and the CPK app that took 10 minutes, and then she left when her table was ready. W.T.F.  Finally it was my turn. I handed the cashier my coupon for the free small plate, she got my order ready, then I paid and left. I look at the receipt, and the cost was $5 more than I thought it would be. I realized she had forgotten to deduct the small plate, so I went back in. Only the takeout cashier could help me, so I had to wait for her once again. By that time there were 3 new people there, but they were nice enough to let me go back to the front. When I asked the cashier about the free small plate, she was a bit annoyed (and probably stressed from the number of waiting people) and told me I needed the printout. I told her it was the first thing I gave her. She looked around and found it, rang up the register and gave me $3.81. I showed her the receipt that the small plate was $5. Confused, she did something on the register and gave me the right amount.  When I got home, I found that the small plate was ridiculously small, as were the pizzas. I had also asked for bread for 4, and I got 3 small slices of bread. I guess this is what the disciples felt like when they had to feed the 5,000. Taste wise everything was fine, but value-wise it was awful. Next time I get a gift card to CPK I will probably regift it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2?start=140

The good: we both got 3 pieces of pizza and were stuffed at the end of lunch, the pizza had a nice little kick to it, the ingredients were fresh and it was a very colorful dish...you eat with your eyes first. The bad: I do not have a sweet tooth what so ever.  I will always choose savory over sweet.  With that said, the sauce that was used on the pizza was WAY too sweet for my liking.

This falls into the Rubios camp of watered down Mexican food.  Some others had the fettuccine, pizza,  and sandwiches.

Also, that being a Sunday night, and the restaurant not spilling with humanity, made a difference in the kitchen.  Our BBQ Chicken pizza had a sweet barbecue flavored chicken cubes and red onion on soft bread,  yummy as we would have expected.  The kitchen could, however, have used a little bit more cilantro; the few cilantro bits were okay for the presentation, but failed to do much for for the taste buds!  My kids had a Cheese and a Pepperoni--the usual.   My Sam Adam paired well with my pizza dinner which we topped later with a Brownie with a dollop of cream on top (for my kids), Vanilla ice cream and a Red Velvet cake.  I'm stuffed! This time was ""now"" and so different from ""then."" ""Then"" was the time, a time over two years ago, when the server was an uninterested local teen, the pizza had rubber pieces for chicken, and it took ages to get water or give order, or get food.  Yes, it was then.  The experience meter had dipped so low into the basement that I could not bother myself to write for one star.  It was then! But, now, it's a new sun with bright SoCal sunshine.  As long as the likes of Jeff remain the sunny face of CPK, I will keep coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2?start=160

My boyfriend and I were looking for a mellow dining experience. I wanted menus and no plastic cutlery, so we settled on CPK. We were seated quickly and the hostess had no problem letting us sit at a nearby booth instead o our original table. We're off to a good start! Our waitress rocked. Friendly, attentive, and accommodating she really made an effort. I was dismayed though to see CPK has weaned down their menu and my favorite menu items are now gone. Wheres my spaghetti with shrimp?!  We had the lettuce wraps to start and I was dismayed to see they send a measly 3 leafs of lettuce. Many restaurants will provide what amounts to almost half a head of lettuce. 3 leaves? For $8?? I gave the 3rd leaf to him and just used my fork for the remaining portion of filling. The sauce provided was also lacking in both flavor and zing. I ordered the tomato and basil pizza with thin crust, and was shocked when it arrived at my table and what looked like globs of TOMATO PASTE were haphazardly thrown on my pizza. I know the cheese and tomato pizza includes nice slices of roma tomatoes, I assumed mine would also but nope! Globs of dried out and sad looking tomato paste. The basil was fresh however, and I was offered more Parmesan and black pepper, but thats more kudos for my server and not for the restaurant.

I mean, when I was in high school, I think we probably kept the one in the Natick Mall open. Nothing like huge pieces of bread with a whole pad of butter on top. ... and then pizza... and then dessert... On a rainy Saturday night, the Carmel Mtn location was packed. But we found seats at the bar to pass the 30 mins. I ordered a strawberry margarita. It was blended (awesomeee). The bartender gave me a huge glass for it, AND he gave me all the leftovers in another glass. Basically got 2 drinks for one. Then, through dinner, I had two more. So sue me! Awesome bartender. Thanks, man! He was kinda cute, too... drink prices are great here, also. Cuz it's the boonies? I dunno. I had the BLT pizza. Because I ALWAYS have the BLT pizza. Except when I'm skinny. Which is clearly not now. So. I had the BLT pizza. AMAZEBALLS.  At the bar, I noticed a picture of a slice of Red Velvet cake on the front of the dessert menu. I thought... they must be lying. It's a fake out. Well.. I clearly hadn't eaten enough after all the bread and all the blended marg and all the pizza, so.. I asked. Do  they really have Red Velvet cake? Oh yea, they sure do. And it's GOOD.  The Red Velvet is not made in-house. They get it from a distrubutor. The best part is.. you can order a whole cake THROUGH CPK to take home. Not kidding! CPK, keep it up.

Rebecca N.,"Arcadia, CA",0,4,,3.0,4/15/2014,"Monday night dinner. Arrived early evening to no wait and sat immediately.  Cpk is a occasional, but familiar place for our family to dine on pizza and pasta. The Sicilian and the chicken piccata are usuals and always consistent. Start off with a soup, this time split pea and half a Chinese chicken, all to share for a family of 2 adults and 2 kids and a baby who is starting to eat, so she gets the sauceless chicken from salad and some soup.  The only food complaint was that the salad looked smaller than usual, a bit wilted, but sparingly dressed the way a salad should be.  The service was as usual, off. This time the waiter seemed not yet awake, with a dose of short term memory. It wasn't too busy, but he had to be asked multiple times for things, silverware and napkins, and he turned around mid way out the kitchen to dish up soup to be sever with our salad, no big deal, apologized and forgiven.  Food came in timely manner from a runner and we were offered cheese and red pepper for our dinner which we accepted.  Halfway through the piccata, I toss the remaining pasta into sauce for distribution and a black, curly, ugly hair popped out, gross, I almost threw up in my mouth. We waived down the waiter, he immediately got the manager, she apologized, removed the item from bill, offered to make another, to eat now or pack for later, never making excuses. I kindly declined and she went further to offer dessert, I looked at my family to see if they were interested as I was no longer interested in eating, but she left the menu, told us to think it over and to let our waiter know. All very kind and all very professional and I have zero complaints about the way the situation was handled. Zero. The kids ended up deciding on the red velvet cake, it was ok, I make better. But all in all, it's too bad that I will mentally need to get over the hair thing before I can return, probably will be inspecting every bite for a while when I finally allow myself to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2?start=220

The next time I tried CPK, I called in my order so I didn't have to deal with the poor service. Again, I was extremely dissapointed. Not only was my order not ready, it was also incorrect. The person who got my order then proceeded to try and convince me that I wanted what they had and didn't want to wait for MY pizza. Needless to say, I wasn't impressed.

As far as service and ambiance the place doesn't really stand out which is why I only give it 3-stars.  I mean, the waitress was ok but we had to ask her to refill our water glasses a few times.  I also had a glass of pinot and it was like 9 dollars and nothing special, I have no idea what brand they use or how long it has been aged.  The prices were average, a little on the pricey side for what you get.  I think they are ana verage restaurant that is trying to be fancy.  But, it's good if you try it out at least once because they do have a lot of interesting pizzas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2?start=220
Jim L.,"San Diego, CA",252,712,226,3.0,9/25/2011,"So it's been ages since I've been to CPK and while the food was decent, it is also quite pricey for what you get.  I mean seriously, it is a pizza!!   Went in on Friday night with a party of 7.  It was pretty crowded however our wait was only about 10 minutes so that wasn't too bad.   Once seated, our server was at our table immediately and took our drink orders.  Sam our server was very attentive throughout the meal and she would check back frequently to make sure that we had everything we needed. The one nice thing about CPK is that they offer many different choices, not only pizza.  As I said, it had been awhile since my last visit and their menu had changed in the meantime. Either it changed or I've gotten MUCH older and just don't have the memory I once had. The food itself was nothing spectacular but it wasn't where it stood out on the bad side either. So to the weird part of my meal.  As mentioned, we had a party of 7.  Well for most of the meal we had an 8th sitting at our table.  The table we were sitting at was booths on one side and chairs on the other.  At the table next to us was a young mother and her 2 y/o son.  Apparently the little boy found our table much more interesting than the going on's at his own table because without awareness, the boy was sitting at our table, practically on my daughters lap.  Cute circumstance? Perhaps.  As with anything however, things are better in moderation and I really wasn't expecting him to sit with us the entire meal.  The last I checked, we we not going to CPK to act as a babysitting service. I did make it clear to the mother that I was not picking up the check for him. Ok, I realize that really had NOTHING to do with CPK but it was too odd not to share.

Emily J.,"San Diego, CA",27,42,,4.0,2/14/2011,"I am not going to get all hyper positive or negative here about the place. It is a clean store, standard offerings, reasonable off-peak wait times. OK. What I am here to report is that this new menu calorie reporting law is really kinda useful. I always liked the BLT pizza there, now I know why: it is probably the lowest calorie thing on the menu and tastes good. Standard cheese pizza is actually listed as lowest at 998, but the sat fat is much higher. Their official menu says the regular dough BLT is 1,320 cals, and the Honey-Wheat Whole Grain is 1,300; 8 g fiber vs. 15 g; 52 g protein vs. 56. I have had both breads, they are really pretty equivalent to me. Just a little more bran-y mouthfeel to the whole grain. Here is the trick though: The waiter says the lettuce is tossed into like 4 tablespoons of mayo before it is applied to the pizza. That's 57 cals per tbsp, or 228. Ask for mayo on the side and light lettuce, +Honey Wheat. You are now talking about a medium pizza that is really right around (if not below) 1,000 cals, hi-pro, low sat fat and half a tomato. Split it with a friend and you are getting out of there with a intermediate-pro sub-500 cal meal for about $5.50 ($10.98/2). That tastes good. That is pretty cool. Note that if you are a sodium freak, this has as much salt as anything with bacon on it. This bacon is fresh and crispy and almost all meat.

Andrea T.,"Greenville, SC",377,252,33,1.0,6/28/2009,"It's hard for me to pinpoint just one reason why I'm giving this place a 1 star review. Perhaps it was the hostess' choice to seat us with our ears next to a constantly slamming door while an indoor/outdoor 10 year old birthday party was in full swing, or maybe it was our disappearing waitress who we saw for ordering, food delivery, and check delivery. Too bad we wanted more dressing! Maybe it was the cold, stale bread, or the fact that my salad had brown lettuce and 3 bite size pieces of chicken in it. Maybe it was when I asked to speak to a manager and they sent over a sous-chef while the manager from then on completely avoided our section of the restaurant. All I know is I won't be trying it again to figure it out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2?start=240

Tried the new broccoli artichoke soup, not the best soup, but adequate. Chicken Milanase was surprisingly good.  The chicken was lightly breaded, tasty and very moist. My standard favorite is the chicken picatta as I love anything with lemon and capers.  Arrived after 8pm to eat, service was slower than usual which surprised me as they were not that busy as we did not have to wait to be seated.  The manager was polite and friendly and came over to apologize for the delay in our dinner entrees.  She said it was her fault due to set up on the line and dessert was on her.  Ordered our favorite, their delicious red velvet cake with ice cream.  Love the plate and presentation of the cake.  Not one bite left.  Waiter wasn't very attentive as i was thirsty and dislike having to ask for refills.  It wasn't that busy so he could easily check up on us.  CPK is still a favorite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2?start=240

Jennifer J.,"Chatsworth, CA",75,21,,2.0,8/15/2011,"Im giving it 3 stars because the food was good and the head cook dealt with our situation really well. I work in a restaurant so i get it, its busy and you cant make it to every table as much as you would like but this was just awful! I have been in other cpks before but this one is just disappointing it looks like a cafeteria. We sat down and our server didnt come by to take our drink order for quite a while. Finally he takes both our drink and food order at the same time. It took a while for our drinks to come out but whatever. Our guacamole came out and it was pretty good. Finally our food came out it was dropped by another person and our server never came by to see if we were ok and we had to flag him down to get refills. About halfway through our meal my boyfriend found something in his pasta idk what it was, we couldnt figure it out so we flagged down our server who just said I will be right back and disappeared? A while later the head cook from the kitchen came out and we showed her what was in our pasta and said if you can just tell us what this is its fine if it was part of one of the ingredients. She had no idea what it was, so she decided to buy us dessert. a while later our server walked up with our dessert and asked us if the chef was covering the dessert? Really? How do you not know that and why did you not ever check on us in between to make sure we were alright? UGGHH annoying awful service! The food was really good so next time I go there it will definitely be for take out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2?start=260

This time we came and not sure what I wanted to get. I looked through the menu and when I finished the food search I decided on getting the chicken tequila fettuccine. The place wasn't as busy as last time I went. We did arrive at around 8pm on Thursday during the chargers game. It should probably be a little bit more busy. I also tried the teriyaki chicken salad which was ok. It seemed a little salty. I also had a glass of the sangria which was more sweet than good. I think it should have been more wine tasting than sweet.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2?start=260

Tom H.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,,2.0,7/27/2011,"Real problem with CPK's expanded menu, due to prices.  CPK's always been a place to eat when I'm willing to spend a little extra $$ or for a business meal. But their expanded menu is missing the mark on price vs. value. Ordered an entree spaghetti that's half the size of what I'd get as an Italian restaurant side dish, at twice the price. Ordered mac and cheese and paid $10 (shame on me)  CPK's introduced a small portions menu, which helps trim costs, but seeing these is a sure sign that a restaurant knows it's over-charging.   And of course, the portions are small, too.  CPK's usual stellar service fell short last night, too. I'll be back there, but will stick with their pizza and half-salad menu, with somewhat decent prices.
