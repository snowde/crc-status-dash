Our server was Tony and he was very cooperative and friendly. I think due to his kindness and great service that he made the environment more welcoming. We were coming in for our friend's birthday and he was a great server.  As for the food it was very tasty. The only wish I had about the place is that the portions were bigger. I did share between a lot of friends, but it be nice. Either way it was very tasty and Tony was a great server.

Eric E.,"San Francisco, CA",80,155,7,4.0,2/19/2008,"I often fantasize that Gavin Newsom will slide into my booth here and enjoy a Sicilian with me.  A Sicilian PIZZA, that is.  The dish CPK does best.  I'd thank him for briefly legalizing gay marriage and praise him for marching with the hotel workers during their strike a few years ago.  I thought that was pretty cool.  We'd be playing footsie as I ordered a bottle of Chianti.  But then I'd let it slip that I think Matt Gonzalez would make far better mayor/boyfriend material and our lunch date would turn sour and he'd leave.  Date over, I'd be there with just my Sicilian pizza and glass of wine to keep me company.  And that'd be just fine. CPK's Sicilian pizza is bountiful with flavor, and the kind you can get at the supermarket does not do the restaurant version justice.  Vegetarians need not apply, as it's got Capicola ham, Italian sausage, and salami.  There's also three types of cheeses on it and a really sweet, crispy crust.  Other good pizzas include their Hawaiian pizza (ask for BBQ sauce instead of tomato) and the crowd favorite, Thai Chicken. Side note: Is it just me, or do the white palm tree silhouettes on the glass panels between booths look just like bird shit?  With, like, one long streak dripping down?  Oh my damn, I am so sorry for that mental image!  Because this place is pretty cool.  It is the most architecturally humble CPK I've ever been to.  Many others tend to have a grand semi-circular design that calls attention to the majesty of the kitchen, but this one is pretty unassuming and it hides in the shadows of City Hall.  Where the mayor works.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco?start=20

Tori L.,"Orange County, CA",1400,1097,502,4.0,4/12/2009,"There are several different types of pizza.  One is the ""I want to eat a lot and stuff my face and be really full after a few slices.""  Then, you have the ""I want to be classy and eat flavorful thin-crust pizzas and never really be full after eating a whole pizza."" CPK falls under the second category, but it's a good thing. I think the only pizza that I wasn't too fond of was the Thai Chicken, which happens to be my best friend's favorite.  I love the BBQ Chicken (especially with the honey wheat crust), the Carne Asada (which tasted like you were eating a taco), and the Neapolitan style pizzas, which are thin-crust. Their other items are also delicious:  The miso salad with shrimp and crab is my favorite, followed closely by the Spinach-Artichoke dip.

The service is a little touch and go.  Sometimes I have great service, other times I wait for almost 10 minutes before my order is taken.

Christine C.,"San Francisco, CA",190,196,88,4.0,4/8/2009,"My first CPK experience was at this location.  I fell in love with the simple Tomato-Basil Spaghettini and 80% of the time, that is what I get. No meat, just a beautiful red, garlicky sauce. The complimentary bread is great as a sauce-scooper.  Also love the Thai Crunch salad - obviously crunchy, two great dressings you can mix together to make a unique combination of flavors.  (The pizza... the pizza.. I'm not a fan of unfortunately. Maybe the Thai Chicken pizza but it's just because there's a peanut sauce in place of the tomato sauce. The melange of toppings on their pizzas, the creativity put into making them is awesome.... but tThe crust is doughy and really not to my liking. I've given the pizza many tries... but nothing satisfies me more than my regulars.) A peach iced tea to go along with any meal, and it's perfect.  This is a great, humble chain of restaurants.

The lighting and seating gives off a comfortable and warm feeling. The waiters and waitresses are really friendly and nice too. The food here is really yummy. Of course, you're most likely here for the pizza. So give The Works pizza a try. It's like any supreme pizza you've had, but CPK makes that ""typical"" pizza not so typical.

Your waiters and waitresses are the genial type of people that I'd probably be friends with out in the real world. HOWEVER, something needs to be done. Numero Uno: Your Van Ness location's bathroom is located at the end of a very long hallway. Getting raped is not on my to-do list, but it might as well be if I venture near that toilet again. Numero Dos: Mango mojitos should have mangos in them. Not mango-flavored rum. REAL mangos. Itty bitty pieces of them. I know I'm asking a lot from a chain, but c'mon. Numero Tres: Where the HELL is the pear gorgonzola pizza? What do you mean you got RID of it? Are you CRAZY? That was one of the best! But you still get three stars cause I like you.

Upon re-visiting an old favorite but here in SF, I was mildly disappointed at the food, portions, and especially the prices! In an attempt to not age myself, I'll just say that a few years back, I remember when half salads were $5 and pizzas were $10. Not only are they closer to $13 but they're noticeably SMALLER! Half salads are now approaching almost $10 too. What a rip-off! It was nice to see my old favorites still on the menu: bbq chicken, hoisin duck, and the assortment of mixed salads. We started off the chicken tortilla soup. This was really tasty! It had big chunks of chicken and the soup was hearty with a little bit of kick.

I think this is a pretty great response.  Hopefully I can update my review with more stars - maybe CPK will rock again!! ****************************** Whooboy, what a disappointment. I'm old enough to remember when the original CA Pizza Kitchen opened up in Hollywood.  Didn't eat there 'til much later, but wow - bbq chicken pizza - yum! And I've eaten at more than one L. A.-based CPK, and had great California pizza experiences - excellent quality, fresh, plentiful and adventurous ingredients. I raved about CPK to my boyfriend, who's from Central Cali, is a pizza lover, and had never been to a CPK before.  He wanted to go here for his birthday, so that's what we did tonight. In a word - mediocre.  In another word - overpriced.  Should have known - the place was only half full on a Saturday night. To be fair, the salad (baby greens) was delicious - but the place isn't called California Salad Kitchen.  We ordered a BBQ Chicken Pizza (around $12) and a Goat Cheese and Grilled Veggie Pizza (around $13 with bacon added). (I want to emphasize - these are *personal sized* pizzas - mini pizzas.  For around $12 apiece.) They tried to bring us the pizza before we'd even got halfway through the salad - boooo. When it arrived, it was *such* a letdown. I make better pizzas at home.  Tasteless crust with no personality whatsoever; extremely stingy on the toppings.  I paid over $2 extra for some bacon on one of the pizzas; I think there was about six to eight little crumbs distributed over the entire thing, and poorly distributed at that.  We fed ourselves, eschewed dessert, and got the hell outta there - bopped down to Trader Joe's to get some chocolate, and saw pizzas in TJ's frozen food section that looked better than the ones we ordered for about $4.00 apiece. (Actually, the BBQ chicken pizza was about $2.75.) If the service or atmosphere had been spectacular, if the wine had been better, if they had done *anything* to acknowledge my boyfriend's birthday (I told the greeter when I came in; not a damn thing happened, not even a ""happy birthday""), there might have been something to warrant the $50 plus price tag for a couple of drinks, two personal size pizzas and a shared salad - but no.

They seem to have this strange obsession with combining strange toppings with other salad-like ingredients. In fact, there are a few items on their menus that have straight up salads on their pizzas. Like the California Club. I had it twice and the second time I thought I would be smart and order it without the mayo drenched lettuce.

I have to admit, I was prepared for some kind of mind-blowing, amazing pizza experience, since my girlfriend kept telling me how great California Pizza Kitchen is, for her SoCal experience of it. Well, the experience was kind of a let down. The cheese had this weird flat quality that could only have come from having been pre-made, stuck in a proofer for several hours, and then maybe microwaved to warm it up. The chicken had a kind of dry, less-than-fresh quality that probably came from the pizza sitting around for hours.  Overall, you get a better value with frozen pizza from Safeway.

People, CPK is a chain.  But as chains go, it's quite good.  And while I have at times had uneven or rushed service here, I've much more often had kind, funny, attentive, smiling and VERY kid friendly service here. SF is full of fancy dish places with sucky service.  I enjoy the consistency of CPK food, the quality of salads especially, the fairly priced wines by the glass - and the nearly always friendly treatment of this tired, urban mom with kid in tow. Also - I've found the managers VERY responsive to feedback when things weren't quite right.  At least they TRAIN servers here.  Which is much more you can say for the many trattorias and fancy joints around town with snotty, absent minded, ""me first"" wait staff who plotz any time you sit down with a kid under the age of 12.   To me, CPK is the best example of chains that work.  If you go and think it needs improvement - try stepping up and discussing it with management.  These folks are all about quality control - but they have to HEAR from you first, dears...  In person, not on Yelp.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco?start=40

Katie P.,"San Francisco, CA",28,271,,3.0,7/19/2006,"Just another CPK but I think for SoCal people, they tend to gravitate here because it is the only one in the city (as opposed to SoCal where you find them almost as much as you find Starbucks).   The service here is pretty good during the week, they can get you in and out of here in an hour during the lunch rush - but you need to let them know you only have an hour.  Menu is huge, lots to pick from.  My current fav is the Chicken Waldorf salad.   Service on the weekends is a bit slower, it definitely isn't ever crowded on the weekends and the staff seems to assume that no one is in a rush.  I guess the moral of the story is, if you have somewhere to be, regardless of when you go, let them know and they will get you out of there on time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco?start=40

I like the grilled vegetable salad and the waldorf. The dressing is good but best on the side, you just need a little. Sourdough bread was a nice accompaniment. The one time I ordered a pizza, the thai chicken, was very disappointed: it was super salty, and the crust was not cooked enough and just kind of yucky. Also, it is rather pricey.

After they finally came to take my order (15+ minutes after being seated) the waiter tried to excuse the behavior by stuttering between ""I didn't see you"", and ""I didn't know this was my table"". Maybe it's because I'm Canadian (wink wink), but I was ashamed to be dinning there. As my meal progressed, I had to remind him to refill empty glasses and to bring my earlier requested water. In the end I couldn't wait for this guy to get around to bringing the check. I just gave him my credit card and made haste out the door and never to return. Of course my waiter was alittle more anxious to get me out the door and kept offering to wrap up my food (barely eaten and not of the best quality).  I was one of the three tables this guy was covering.  I left decent tip but immediately regretted it.

I had a hard time picking from all the pizzas, so I just went with the BBQ chicken, which the menu says is the most popular. Sure enough, it turned out to be delicious, and just the right size. I left feeling satisfied but not overly stuffed. I also love that if you order lemonade or a fountain drink, you get unlimited refills. I ordered the strawberry lemonade, and it was so good I must have had my glass refilled at least 5 times. And finally, for dessert (yeah, yeah, I know) I picked the red velvet cream cheese cake rather than the chocolate souffle on the recommendation of my server. Gut-wrenchingly delicious. One curious thing I noticed though: An awful lot of people were ordering the salad. May I just ask why on earth you'd order something like that in a pizza restaurant? Even if they're really good...why??? You go to a pizza place, get the pizza! Don't be so obsessed about the carbs! Burn them off later! You think that salad is low calorie?
