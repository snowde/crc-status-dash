maggie w.,"San Jose, CA",40,42,33,5.0,12/16/2017,"I've always loved their pizza salads but this review is for my kids birthday party.  At $10 kid you get to make your own pizza, drink, a chef hat to decorate, an ice cream sundae and a tour of the kitchen.  The birthday child also gets a nice chef coat. The price is unbeatable and the service was great. The manager James is awesome. He was very helpful and accommodating. It felt very organized.  We got our own server that tended to all our needs.  She was great with the kids and was very attentive. Thanks Julie!  You have to have the party before the restaurant opens but you get the whole place to yourself with all the staff helping the only customers there (the party). I highly recommend having kid birthday parties here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose
Nancy H.,"San Jose, CA",28,84,145,4.0,11/27/2017,"I've never ordered anything other than their pizzas here. Today I decided to try The Chicken Tequila Fettuccine and I agree with other yelpers, it's a must try and will most likely be my go to order from now on if I want pasta at CPK. It's light with creaminess and flavor and the lime is not too overpowering. That was one thing I was worried about because I can't handle sour foods and drinks. It was surprisingly refreshing to all the other pastas I normally order. Decent amount given, I had to to-go my portion not because I couldn't finish it(I wanted to) but because I wanted to save some for tomorrow.  I also ordered their sangria flight. It's definitely worth the $11. However, if you do decide to get it, let me know if the strawberry one tastes like lavender soap because it sure did to me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose
Max P.,"Stanford, CA",0,18,1,2.0,8/28/2017,"Came in a Monday evening. Light customers.  Service is great.  Food. It so much. Salmon is dry and tasteless, garlic fettuccine has a stale smell. Bread is old, shrimp scampi lacks a kick.   Maybe should try the pizza because everything else not pizza could is tasteless.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose
Rubi D.,"San Jose, CA",39,79,59,5.0,8/26/2017,"It was my first time here and I loved it! It's a very underrated place. I had a great wondorlf salad it had just the right amount of dressing not drenched at all and they have half size options for salads. I tried they're sangria flight which is only $1 than one sangria lol. The honey sangria was so yummy and different! The orange sangria tasted like a low sugar lemonade very light but still refreshing! The inside is super casual with friendly service all around. Our water Julie really knew the menu and was able To make great suggestions. We had the butterscotch dessert which was crispy on the outside, moist inside, and topped with vanilla. It was so savory and just the right size to share for two without feeling completely full and tired after!!!!  Sangria flights $11 ish  Half Size salad $11  Decent prices. Will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose
Alana Z.,"Campbell, CA",161,4,,2.0,1/6/2018,"Usually I go to the CPK at Valley Fair off Stevens Creek...but this by far has been a terrible restaurant experience. First, we waited 15 minutes to get our drinks and bread. Then, when we finally got our food my boyfriends steak was overcooked and dry so we had to take it back. And then our sodas were drowned down with water they poured- forgetting we ordered soda. I almost forgot to mention we waited 5 minutes after getting our food to get utensils. They gave us a $10 discount...but probably not coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose
Brenda L.,"Syracuse, NY",970,1933,3490,4.0,12/14/2017,"I love this place and come here on occasion with my family. It's a great restaurant to eat after a long day of shopping. I like their individual sized pizzas and salads. They even have pizzas that have tons of vegetables on top (basically a raw salad on top). I remember the excitement around this place when they first opened up. They sell alcoholic drinks, salads, sandwiches, pasta and desserts as well. The interior is casual/sophisticated but there is dining/sit-down service. It is good for a family meal or casual date. This place is called California Pizza Kitchen but their locations aren't exclusive to CA. This was the 1st place I ever saw an Asian-flavored pizza. They have frozen pizzas now at grocery stores so I try to order stuff that I don't see in their frozen food line in order to get a different experience. I always feel ripped off if I am buying something in a restaurant for more than what I can get it for at the grocery store.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose
Kait P.,"San Jose, CA",89,176,105,5.0,3/26/2017,Always great service whenever I come! And the food is always superb as well. Waits are never very long but that also depends on the day and time you go.  Pizza's are always recommended but their other menu options are to die for! I've had some of their pastas and salads and haven't been disappointed.

Paige B.,"San Jose, CA",39,225,47,2.0,1/6/2017,"Food ok. Liked the whole wheat option on the pizza crust. Kids Mac n cheese was dry like the desert. Thai salad good. Zucchini shrimp fettuccine was not spiralized as advertised, but good flavor...  Big drawback... here at 10:05 pm and vacuuming right under our feet, and over our conversation. We were the last people in our section but there were a good 20 other customers still in the restaurant... boo Despite that, or server, Noe gave us very pleasant and good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose
Jaane F.,"San Jose, CA",73,281,2045,3.0,11/4/2016,"My bf and I came here to have gathering with his group of friends. So both of us ordered wild mushroom strozzapretti which is a seasonal dish. The dish is little salty and more like Asian soy sauce dish. But we are still fine with the taste as it wasn't taste any special. Beer is not too expensive and the pizza is usually set for an individual portion, but can still be shared. The atmosphere and the ambience makes for good casual games outings and the service was fine. The parking at the Oakridge mall area is still quite tedious, but the location is easy to find.  Overall, the experience was nice and the food was good for the occasion. I probably will not come back here again unless I am coming here to have dinner with friends for happy hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose

Christine S.,"San Jose, CA",70,303,117,5.0,5/6/2017,"It's a bit weird that you can't access this restaurant from inside the mall but anyway, we were happy to grab a bite to eat here before our movie. It was not busy at 5 PM on a Friday so we were seated immediately. My husband and I both tried the sangria's they were advertising and both were very flavorful. He got his usual BBQ chicken pizza and I got my usual Sicilian. Bummed the white pizza is no where to be found on the menu but both pizzas were great as expected. Our server was also very nice, attentive, and funny. This is a solid choice for any meal if you're at the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose
Jia Qi F.,"East Bay, CA",557,202,429,4.0,10/13/2016,"Parking SUCKS around here, especially at night. Otherwise, the food ans service was wonderful and took real good care of us even the manager when we tried to flag down our waitress. If you sign up on their rewards program, you get a free small plate! We ordered the bolognese spaghetti, the Works pizza, avocado eggrolls, the blanco flatbread as our free small plate, and chocolate souffle as our dessert. Pricey pricey but overall a good family restaurant! -bolognese spaghetti: basic, not really flavorful but not a fan of marinara in general. Tiny mushrooms to add is $1.50, like really?!  -avocado eggrolls: so good! It comes with two types of dip, ranch and a chiptole creamy one. Its stuffed with avocado so if youre a fan this is a good choice for starters.  -the Works: stuffed by this pizza! Its hearty with pepperoni, sausage, olives, etc.  -blanco flatbread: big pass for me. It was basically cheese pizza that was SOOOOO oily. I wish I read the menu more carefully but its topped with sage and holy crap, it was SO bitter and this funky taste. No bueno.  -chocolate souffle: sweet and really rich chocoate brownie with vanilla ice cream on the side.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose
Diana T.,"San Jose, CA",223,401,877,5.0,2/12/2017,"Great place for pizza, pasta wine and desserts and speciality pizzas like BBQ chicken and Thai chicken. BBQ chicken is my favorite. The dough for the original pan pizza is thick and cooked to perfection. Their are also thin crust pizzas. A really good pasta is the mushroom pasta with lightly flavored with little to no sauce. Lettuce  wraps are a healthy choice for appetizers. A wide selection of wine to go well with the pizza is red wine. The chocolate soufflé comes with ice cream and is delicate and slightly sweet with a good taste of chocolate with chocolate syrup on top of the ice cream.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose
Mark D.,"San Jose, CA",19,300,197,5.0,9/24/2016,"I've had CPK a few times in the past, mainly because some friends like the chain and they order for take out now and then.  I finally decided to try it for lunch.  I ended up really enjoying it. We weren't very hungry so my wife and I ordered the Asparagus & Arugula Salad, Buffalo Cauliflower, and the Wild Mushroom Strozzapreti to share.   First of all, the complimentary bread and olive oil dip was excellent.  The bread was warm and had a great texture.  The dip was a bit heavy on the rosemary but good nonetheless.  The salad was on the small side but tasty and had some good fresh ingredients. The cauliflower with the buffalo sauce was good but at $8, could have used a few more pieces. The best item was the pasta. The rolled pasta had great chewy texture, plenty of wild mushroom, and tossed in sauce with perfect amount of seasoning.  The Arnold Palmer had the right balance between lemonade and iced tea also.  Our server, David, was fantastic. He had several tables to take care of, including a large party, but seemed to be everywhere at once. We were also impressed with the fact that he split up the pasta dish for us without even being asked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose
Andrea S.,"San Jose, CA",1833,122,9477,4.0,5/22/2016,"CPK is a place I'd normally not venture. I needed to spend my gift card. It's nice that it's family & kid friendly. And of course pizza is one of most kids' favorite things to eat. The two times here with my son have been good experiences. Waiters and hostess were all nice and provided great service.  I wasn't feeling like having pizza on any of the times here. The first time I ate here with my son I chose the Jambalaya Fettuccine. It is one of their pasta items. It is described as blackened chicken and shrimp, crawfish, andouille sausage and tasso ham in our spicy cajun sauce. I really liked the flavors. Normally I don't eat spicy but their sauce I could handle. All the many shrimp were big and the crawfish were thankfully de-shelled. So those crawfish aren't too noticeable. Sausages were more visible. Fettuccine noodles were al dente. Good and consistent both times. They give a separate kids menu along with crayons. My son chose Hawaiian pizza and Fresh fruit. Second time around he chose the BBQ Chicken Pizza and also Fresh fruit. Fresh fruit are sliced pineapple and halved red grapes.  Size of our non-fat yogurt smoothies were huge. Definitely a large cup. We chose Mango & Strawberry Banana. Both were good too and made us full.  Thank you for the few September nights off of my typical dinners at home and having a break from washing dishes and cleaning the kitchen. Tips to my servers were well deserved. Thank you again California Pizza Kitchen team!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose
Lara F.,"Los Gatos, CA",154,304,102,5.0,12/7/2016,"I've been coming here since they opened *cough cough* years ago.  I've seen the ups & downs with the whole chain. I like how this restaurant has kept it's warmth.  The menus and uniforms changed but they still put the customer first.  We always have a great time and the food is always perfect. They do have a full bar which is a bonus since hubby likes scotch whiskey...ok, they don't have any scotch whiskey but they do have Jack Daniels. And that makes most everyone happy. I like the wine selection.  Not so big that you're scratching your head. But there are a few choices in good range of varietals.  I also like that they offer wine pairings with some of the menu items.  They also have 6oz and 9oz glass sizes.  (so I can get a 6oz wine for my appetizer and a 9oz with my meal). Do try the flatbreads. They're absolutely wonderful.  And I also love their tortilla spring rolls. I used to get that for my appetizer.  I appreciate they have seasonal dishes.  I wish they'd bring back the deep fried artichoke hearts. The bathroom is cleaned regularly. And it used to have a really awful smell. They've masked it. I suspect they've tried everything to get rid of it but can't. They have a counter area where you can just walk in and hop up and it's full service. This is nice if you're needing to get in and out quickly for a movie.  I love sitting there and watching the flames in the oven. It's like sitting in front of a warm fireplace. And I love the pizzas.  I wish they'd bring back the BLT pizza.   Anyway, I like the honey wheat crust.  And don't be afraid to branch out. You'd be surprised how great the pear and gorgonzola pizza is for lunch with a friend. I used to get half sized salads which were perfect.  (I like to rotate my preferences). And save room for the butter cake dessert.  We get ours without the ice cream.  Sure, we're heathens, but we don't want anything to get in the way of the toe curling numminess of the butter cake. So, I see people talk about parking.  Yes, it can suck. I park either over in the lot outside of Sears along Thornwood.  Or I'll park in the structure that's next to Sears.  There's almost always parking in the upper levels.  And then I walk to the food court area, exit the doors, turn left and walk a little ways.  It's not bad and it increases my fitbit numbers. Do I wish they had a mall entrance? Oh sure.  But they don't. So I plan on walking rather then parking near it.  There is a Valet Parking station right near them...you go past and then you can see the tent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose
Melissa N.,"San Jose, CA",16,123,275,4.0,10/4/2016,"First of all, it's at Oakridge Mall, so parking is scarce especially around the restaurant area. My best recommendation is to park elsewhere and just walk there. Target has a parking structure and it's kind of nearest to most of the restaurants.  Anyway, we went at lunch time, 1230-ish and it was not busy at all. We got seated right away and our waiter was Noel, Noe, couldn't really see his name tag, something like that. Regardless, he was really attentive, greeted us with smile, told us about some of their drinks that they, and lastly, he came by checking up on us often and refilled our drinks without being asked. My sister-in-law ordered the Spaghetti bologanese (?) something like that, basically spaghetti with meat sauce (not pictured) but she normally likes it as she always orders that. I didn't try it. I had the Garlic Roasted Chicken Fettuccine and it was delish! It was just the right about of sauce, not too garlicky, and not too overwhelming. Really creamy and absolutely delicious. The bits and pieces of chicken was a little underwhelming, I felt that some pieces were dry and just didn't taste good. For an extra $3. I was better off without the chicken. The pizza was good. I don't like pineapple, so I didn't have any of the Hawaiian pizza, the mushroom, sausage, pepperoni pizza was good, although, the meats made the pizza a little salty. I didn't enjoy that as much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose
Robert H.,"San Jose, CA",590,298,2165,4.0,3/20/2016,"Conveniently located on the perimeter of the mall, it is definitely a good family type of restaurant. Do they make great pizza? I'd have to say yes! Are the other dishes up to par? I'd have to say unfortunately not. Don't get me wrong, I don't think they are capable of serving you a bad dish, but there are a couple of dishes that are just missing that ""WOW"" factor. Here is today's line-up: The Works (Pizza) Roasted Artichoke Spinach (Pizza) Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings Four Cheese Raviolis The pizzas were on point! No doubt! From the crust, meat, and artichoke hearts & spinach, everything was assembled and baked to perfection! Now moving on to the to the other dishes... The dumplings were decent, but the sauce that was drizzled on was a bit salty, and there was a little too much of it. I know the sauce also add's to it's presentation, but unfortunately it's consistency. The raviolis were cooked perfectly, but the cheese within was more bland than tasty. I was hoping it was just the first one I tried, but after eating my 3rd rav, it just didn't pack enough flavor for me. Our waiter was very friendly attentive, but he seemed a bit flustered at times. With a party of 14 it is understandable, but we found ourselves asking for things repeatedly. Luckily everything came out in a timely manner, so our overall experience here was a good one. Conclusion:  It is a convenient place to hit for pizza when you are in the mall, and are not in the mood to deal with the crazy food court crowds. I know that many of us our bummed that Pizza Studio is no longer open in the food court, but luckily we still have a great pizza place to fall back on!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose

John J.,"San Jose, CA",385,506,737,3.0,12/26/2012,"If you come to California Pizza Kitchen, you don't come here to eat pasta or salad. There's a Bucca di Beppo next door if you want pasta, and one of those vegan places inside the mall next to Target. I don't recommend one of those pizza/salad hybrids either; the presentation just looks awkward and I think pizza and salad belong on two separate plates. Since you came all the way to CPK, you should a pizza. They're sliced into quarters, and some of them come in the honey wheat crust variety. I had the Spicy Chicken Chipotle last time, but only because I wanted to try something new. Normally, I would recommend the Pear Gorgonzola or Thai Chicken or Jamaican Jerk. They are CPK's staples. Everything else that I've tried are a step below it. If you get dessert, get the Red Velvet Cake with vanilla ice cream, and make sure you  share with a friend. One slice is too big for just yourself, so for $8.25, you want to spread the happiness with your fellow man. In terms of just its pizza, this CPK is good. Of course there's better, Papa Murphy's Take and Bake for one, but for a sit-down pizza dinner with friends, CPK will do. Just be careful because it's pricey. There were 11 of us, and we ran up a ~$240 bill including tax and the 18% gratuity. If you're anticipating large parties, it wouldn't hurt to go to Costco in advance and purchase a few $100 gift cards for $80 apiece.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=60

I ordered the thin crust California club pizza with a pint of beer and it came out to over $20.00! I wouldn't really mind paying this amount, but the pizza itself was just alright in my opinion. The ingredients were actually really fresh for the most part, but it was lacking flavor and it didn't have as much of a crunch to it as I would have liked.  As for the service that too was okay, it was a bit crowded when we went so our food did take a little while to get to us, but our waitress Rebecca was a really sweet so we didn't care too much.

When our appetizers came out the drinks follow.  Once the drinks came out, the water was being served to the group and the server spilled the water all over me and another guest.  Ok, thankfully it was not hot beverage.  However my nice sweater and jeans were soaked.  So what shocked me,  disappointed me and was completely appalling, was the following events.  Keep in mind this happened in front of the bar/cooking area, where several servers, cook  and even the Male manager, wearing a blue shirt, saw the whole thing because I looked right at all of them. 1.  Not once was or ever offered a towel or napkins, I had to get up myself and go to the bathroom and get paper towels to dry myself. 2.  No one came to dry the water off the table, I did it myself with the help of my group. 3.  When the manager finally did come by, his only question to us was how is was your food?  Really, how was the food?  I couldnt taste it because I was wearing ice cold jeans and a drenched shirt which you guys did not offer a towel for me to dry. 4.  When the final bill came out, there was not mention of a comp, removal of an appetizer or even an apology from the manager! This was absolutely appalling.  I can not believe the service and how we/I was treated at California Pizza Kitchen.   What used to be a decent place to go has took a turn for the worse. The Management and service was really horrendous here when I went Saturday night 12/15/2012.   Did I need to get something spilled something on me that was hot or worse, have food spilled on me to get an apology of some sort?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=60

Since we were quite hungry, my bf and I ordered a spinach artichoke dip, thin crust California Club, and the chicken tequila fettuccine.  Our appetizer came out first (of course) and it was yummy. The dip wasn't thick like some places and it had a good consistency. My only negative feedback about this is the piece of artichoke heart in the dip, and the messy playing (dip spilled over the bowl). Those should be cleaned up before serving.  Our server also brought us some bread with (I'm guessing) rosemary olive oil. Let me tell you, the dip tastes really yummy with the bread! Next came our pizza and Alfredo. The pizza looked humongous because of the salad on top. It looked like a healthy pizza. I love the nuttiness of the arugula paired with some iceberg salad tossed in ranch. The bacon was cooked to perfection. It had a nice crunch with out the greasy fat or burnt taste. And the chicken melted into the pizza dough with the cheese. It was a nice combo, but a bit messy to eat.  When I first saw the Alfredo, I noticed the green pasta and thought it was a tad strange. As we tasted it, it had a perfect balance of flavor with a good hint of lime. It also had some sautéed onion and bell pepper which balanced the dish extremely we'll. Normally, we aren't fond of bell peppers because of how thick the cuts are (the flavors are very predominant). However in this dish, the peppers were julienned and brought great flavors without overpowering the dish.  Overall, everything was really yummy and we would definitely come back.  PS the mango iced tea and white Caribbean sunset sangria are delish! I'd recommend the mango iced tea! It has a really nice balance and not too sweet. *posted some pics of our food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=60
Mark M.,"Tracy, CA",0,142,,5.0,7/27/2014,Went here for Lunch on 7-25-14 The parking Really stinks at this location so my wife and daughter were dropped off to go get a table. Took me 20 minutes of circling before I got a spot. My wife and daughter had all that time to look at the menu and still were not sure what to get. Our server was named Cole and he was amazing. He was so nice and helpful. He took the time to explain all of the pizza and told my girls to be adventurous and try the Avocado pizza which had some salad on it. It was definitely not my cup of tea so I got the standard thin pepperoni pizza. The girls also got a small wedge salad that all 3 of us shared and it was the perfect amount. We had way more food than we needed. Every bite was better than the next. They loved the wild salad pizza and my boring one was also great.  Very good food and the Best server I had had in years.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=60

Plus they have one at almost all the malls I like to go shopping at such as Valley Fair and Oakridge. They have more than just pizza too. You can get a great salad, sandwich, or pasta. Whenever I come to one of their restaurants I get my usual.  Tortilla Spring Rolls - thai chicken and baja chicken Wild Mushroom Pizza or Thai Chicken Pizza Those are my usual dishes. I love the peanut sauce. GOT TO HAVE IT! Well on my most recent trip I went to this Oakridge location. Great service and fast! Here's what we ordered: Tortilla Spring Rolls - of course!  White Corn Guacamole + Chips Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Pizza Wild Mushroom Pizza Garlic Cream Fettuccine with Mushrooms All the food was good! Is it me or are the pizzas here bigger than the ones at Valley Fair? The fettuccine was really good! I recommend all their food.

Easy parking and no wait was definitely a plus - which is pretty rare for a restaurant at Oakridge. The free bread was pretty good, with a side of herby olive oil. I ordered the lunch combo - 7"" original BBQ pizza with a Mediterranean side salad. Salad had garbanzo beans, which I'm not a big fan of, but it was good overall.

It's just one of those places I don't understand...pizza, pasta, and such would seem simple enough but it just doesn't hit the spot for me. Oily pastas?  Cardboard overpriced pizzas? Burnt chocolate desserts? I should have known by the empty restaurant during dinner time that I should have turned back. Unfortunately I had a $50 gift card to get rid of, so I finally put it to use and ordered a shrimp scampi, hawaiian pizza, cheese pizza, and chocolate souffle. It took about half an hour to receive our food.

Dang L.,"San Jose, CA",8,132,183,3.0,1/15/2017,"Been here through the years. Usually I like the vegetarian pizza and the peach salad. Unfortunately, no more peach salad on the current menu.  For starters, they will serve warm bread with all of oil and herbs. This is fine but having a little balsamic vinegar with the Olive oil would go a long way. Can't complain though because it's complementary.  Pepperoni pizza- kids meal for my daughter. It's good, but so common. 3 stars.  Rib eye with finger potatoes and arugula salad- 4 stars. 12 oz ribeye. My favorite cut served with blue cheese butter. The blue cheese butter did not do much for the meat except made it slightly salty. Good  smoked grilled flavor. Slightly burned because the hubby likes it well done. The finger potatoes weren't all that- need some flavor And to be cooked further. Arugula did complement the rib eye.  I got the wild mushroom pasta. Their seasonal special menu. 3 stars mainly for flavor. The pasta was supposed to be sautéed with different wild mushroom but all I saw in the pasta was crimini mushroom. So disappointed. Supposed to have crimini, portabello, and ""seasonal mushroom"". I didn't make a big fuss because I was hungry but definitely did not come as advertise. My last experience I ordered the veggie pizza and had to complain because it did not have any eggplant as describe in the description.

We always get the red wine flight because it goes so well with whatever we order and the 3 wines in the flight are all wonderful.

Tiffany H.,"San Jose, CA",553,161,703,3.0,1/28/2016,"Tired from shopping and just want a place to grab dinner? CPK is an A-OK choice!  My family and I were looking for a place to eat while shopping around Oakridge Mall and we decided to eat at CPK. It was a Saturday night and the wait was about 30 minutes which isn't as bad compared to the wait at Cheesecake Factory. Although, they seemed disorganized. One of the waiters said we were ready to be seated, took us to our table and then told us she made a mistake and that our table wouldn't be ready in about 10 more minutes. When it was really our turn to be seated, we were given menus without the drink menu. Our waiter came and introduced himself, noticed that we didn't have drink menus and kindly got us it. After a few minutes, we ordered and waited for our food for about 15 minutes. During our wait, we had some on-the-house fresh bread to dip with herb olive oil. The waiter was kind enough to get us more after we were done! For our order, we ended up getting the Thai crunch salad, Sicilian pizza, BBQ pizza, wild mushroom pizza and the chicken tequila fettuccine.  The Thai Crunch salad was really good. Not the best salad I've ever had but it had the crunch of the ingredients, topped with thai peanut dressing that was delicious overall.  Out of the 3 pizzas I ordered, mine and my family's favorite was the BBQ chicken pizza with its sweet & tanginess. The Sicilian pizza and the wild mushroom were both tied for my 2nd favorite in different ways. The Sicilian pizza was basically a meat pizza with italian sausage, spicy capicola ham & salami. It was delicious but was a little bit too oily. Also, for a thin crusted pizza, it wasn't as crunchy as I would have liked it. The Wild Mushroom pizza is a definite pizza for mushroom lovers/vegetarians. I thought it was really good but my parents didn't like it so much so I guess it depends on the person. It was also a bit on the oily side as well. Overall, all the pizzas were pretty good but I wish they were baked a little longer because most of them came out soggy.  My favorite dish here was the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine. I finished this dish up fast. The jalapeno lime sauce was a perfect sauce to go along with it. It added a tangy taste to the spinach fettuccine. I definitely would recommend trying this dish here!  Overall, my experience was average. Our waiter was really nice but I think the staff needs a little bit more work on organization. The food here is mediocre but it's a nice place to eat when you're at the mall!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=20

Another good tip is to take advantage of their ""small plates"" menu. We usually order 3-4 of theses along with an order of chicken lettuce wraps.  The BBQ Chicken Pizza is their best and signature pizzas. The cilantro adds a nice touch and the BBQ sauce is a tangy compliment.

It's located at Oakridge mall next to Cheesecake Factory and Forever 21. The entrance is outside. There's a lot of parking but if you go around dinner time, parking may be a bit hard to find since there's also a movie theater here. So plan accordingly!  This location is really small compared to the other restaurants in the area. You can call in and make a reservation although on busy days they won't take it. You have to show up in order for them to write your name down. They are very nice and understanding. We had a party of 17 and they did their best to seat us within 45 minutes.  To start off the night, I ordered the mango strawberry cooler. It was one of their new drinks. It tasted very refreshing. There were strawberries and a like slice on top. I wished this drink had free refills though! Hint hint**  I decided to have pasta instead of a pizza. Which is very unusual since I love pizza! But I made the correct choice with my four cheese ravioli! It was delicious! I cleaned the whole plate! I also got to taste me friends white sauce pizza with bacon. That was delicious too! Next time I will order their pizza for sure!  I really don't have any complaints for this place. The service was pretty good considering we had a large party and it was very busy as well!

I missed to notice the call when they rang up and when I did, walked up to the restaurant. They were courteous enough to allot a table right after even though there were people waiting. To start with, our waitron girl with the glasses (don't remember her name) was super attentive and her service was great. We ordered Spicy Buffalo Cauliflower, Cedar Plank Salmon, Asparagus Spinach Spaghettini and the Mango Strawberry Cooler. Of-course the house-made bread and Rosemary olive oil was a great little freebie to start our dinner. Buffalo Cauliflower was very tasty and a must try if you like spicy food.

Jess D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1080,56,16,2.0,6/15/2012,"You know you have a YELP problem when you are dining at a restaurant and the second they mess up your order, you shout ""People are gonna hear about this on YELP! ya hear me!?""  Okay... so maybe I didn't say that loud enough for the waiter and his crappy manager to hear me, but I said it to myself in character, as I sipped from my watered down tea with melted ice.  I am getting ahead of myself here. The day started with meeting a friend for lunch at California Pizza Kitchen, or as us lazy social networking abbreviators like to say, ""CPK"". That sounds so LA... ugh!  Anyways, I ordered a half thai chicken salad, with no scallions.  Now maybe this might defeat the purpose for some people, when it comes to their Thai salads, but I am a no onion, no scallion kinda gal... so when I say no scallion, no scallion... capiche?  What does the waiter bring me? a salad with scallions all up in it. I felt as violated as a Kardashian sex tape, as I bit into the salad - and from my lip, fell an oniony flavored morsel... YES, a SCALLION!  At that point, I felt just like Faye Dunaway portraying Joan Crawford in MOMMIE DEAREST.. ""NO SCALLIONS! I SAID...NO SCALLIONS!"" (yes I reference this movie in yelp reviews a lot, just bare with me).  Just as this visual played perfect in my mind of yelling this to our waiter, he was nowhere to be found. Gone Baby Gone, Without A Trace, Bye Bye Birdie, like every bad titled tv show or movie that I had ever seen, he was MIA (and bad singers too).  A good 6-8 minutes (which felt like 30) passes by and along comes the manager to ask how everything is and fill up our drinks.  I tell her about my salad, (which by this point, I have just started eating and taking out the scallions). She then asks if I want to replace it, and I tell her, it is ok, I will just pick the rest out, being I had picked a bunch out already...plus, we had to catch a movie and time was ticking.  So, when my bill comes, she doesnt give me the salad for free, like most chain type restaurants would, she deducts just $3.00 from the salad (a $9.50 salad).  Mind you, I also purchased food for my children. It is not like the bill would have been a zero balance, if she took the salad off.  I still was going to pay for other items. I just found it kind of a bummer that instead of just crediting the half salad for their mistake, she basically wiped a measly 10% from my $30.00 meal.  At that point.. I just wanted to get up and say ""YOU CANT HANDLE THE TRUTH!"" or go into some sort of ROCK OF AGES / TWISTED SISTER ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" dance routine with my fellow dining patrons behind me all the way out the door.  One can dream, but my salad, on the other hand... like the wise guys from Good Fellas, can ""sleep with the fishes""...  Too soon?

This review is more for the location. This CPK is located in a busy mall in San Jose, so parking was a tremendous pain. I think it took about 20 minutes to park during prime dinner time. (There is valet parking for $8 though.)  If you are close with your group members, I would recommend having someone go and put your name in for your table and order first, so the food can be in the works by the time your driver finds a spot.

They've up'ed their service and the quality of the food tastes alot better then they did before. They've also added quite a few new items to their menu and made it more healthier. I love all their pizza's. There is one that I remember specifically, their Habanero Carnitas pizza. It comes with a side of seriously spicy sauce. HOLY COW. My mouth was on fire but it was still tasty, just needed a few glasses of water to go with that :) I don't know if I was preggos and easy to please, but I also thought their chicken garlic creamy fettuccine was fantastic. I was really craving garlic pasta sauce that day and it hit the spot - right on! I completely devoured it without putting down my fork.  I don't know if its a new thing, but the last couple times I've been here, the chef bought out the food to our table. The same chef would also come by our table during our meal and ask us how the food is and comment on it if we had any questions. Nice touch.

The food is always great and comes out quickly, which can be a lifesaver when you have 2 hungry little kids.  The staff is PHENOMENAL. The hosts always greet you with a smile and seat you faster than what they quote you (if there's a wait). There are two managers, Andy and Kimmie, that always check on the guests to ensure things are going well. They are very friendly and you can tell that they enjoy their jobs! Since we do go there a lot, we usually ask for Cole or Ginger. Both are attentive and always on the ball. Our drinks get refilled before we finish them, even when it's a packed house. They're both great with our kids and easy to talk to. They make it feel like a neighborhood restaurant, which is the main reason why we come back.  My wife loves the new menu and I LOVE the new TVs.

After waiting for 30 min (I was given a 15-20 min waiting time), I realized that these tables were still not being used, so I asked if they were reserved. The waitress told us they weren't and told us that we would soon be seated.  We were seated after 45 min and found out they were trying to squeeze the 4 of us into a small table that usually seats 2 people. I asked if we could have one of the larger tables but our request was denied. We eventually ended up leaving and eating elsewhere where we got a much better service.

Rita V.,"San Jose, CA",56,732,781,3.0,1/7/2011,"CPK really doesn't take reservation, but they will put your name on the 'call ahead wait list'.  When I called a few days before the party, the hostess told me to call a few hours before the party to put my name down.  Since they open at 11:30am, I decided to call at 11:15am.  When I talked to the hostess, she told me to call 30 minutes before I was going to arrive @ CPK..lol. Anyway, I was able to put my name down for a party of 15 people to celebrate a friend's birthday.  When I arrived at CPK, the hostess told me she put my name down for a table of 2.  She misheard me saying 15 on the phone.  I was glad that it was still early, so we were able to get seated within 5 minutes.  This CPK doesn't have a lot of space to seat huge parties, since a lot of the tables are booths.   The server we got was really good.  She served our drinks fairly quick, even when some of the guests asked for warm water.  She even brought out a lot of complimentary sourdough bread for us to munch on while we waited for our entrees. All of our orders came out about 20 minutes later.  Since we were a huge party, half of the group got the food first.  A few minutes later, the majority of the group had their food.  However, my friend had to wait a lot longer for his clam pasta dish, while the rest of us had our food. (Minus 1 star) I ordered the chicken pesto thin crust pizza and it was really good.  The crust was thin and crispy, which is how i like it.  There was not a lot of chicken on the pizza (minus 1 star).  The pizza was a bit dry, so it would have tasted better if there was more pesto. Overall, CPK has decent pizzas, but they are a bit overpriced.  I would not recommend this place for huge groups unless you go super early, otherwise you will have to wait for a table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=80

BOTH times the pizza's were room temp when I opened the boxes after walking out of the restaurant.  I'm pretty sure they cook their pizzas before hand and then warm them up for take out... uhm.. is it really hard to cook pizza's to order?

Both were good , and for our dessert, we had the Red Velvet Cake which our waitress told us we should order since she would see almost every customer ordered it at the restaurant. In the end we end up paying about $50 dollars worth of food, which is i think is good for an appetizer, 2 pizzas, 2 drinks (lemonade) and a dessert.

Tiffany K.,"Fremont, CA",905,996,49,2.0,8/29/2008,"I love my CPK, but last week during my dinner out with the boyfriend, we didn't have the best experience. We usually go to the CPK at Valley Fair, but we felt like doing something different, and plus I needed to go to Target (which is in the same mall). From the start, things weren't going so well. Not sure if it was because we arrived around 9PM, an hour before closing, but the service shouldn't be different no matter what time of day we go.  The hostess here wasn't so great, and just sat us, put the menus in front of us, and walked away. Didn't really say anything, and seemed like she just wanted to get us out of her way. After we sat down, we realized that there was a really weird smell amidst the air. Our table, or the area around us, smelled like mildew / wet towel. My boyfriend and I noticed that the other CPK at valley fair smells too, but like cleaning chemicals - so, at least it's clean there? Our waitress was nice, but seemed either new to the job position, or just didn't care. We asked for lemons in our water, and there was no lemon in the water when we came - not a big deal, but shows how much your server listens. Then, I ordered a grilled vegetable sandwich and asked specifically for no mushrooms, and when the sandwich came, there was a lot of mushrooms in it. So I would've told our server this so she could get a new one made, but she pretty much dissapeared for the entire half an hour of our dining time.  But luckily, she was smart and took 20% off on our bill. Funny thing is, she didn't even care to let us know why she took 20% off, and didn't even tell us. She just kinda threw the bill at us - but it was pretty obvious why she had done so.  Anyhow, I like my CPK food, but we didn't have a great experience here, so maybe I'll just stick to Valley Fair.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=180

For pizza, I would recommend the BBQ chicken, The Works, and if you like mushrooms, the Wild Mushroom. Their pizza only comes in one size here, which is more like a medium.

L F.,"Los Gatos, CA",1,88,8,1.0,6/28/2011,"The food is decent here. Due to a recent promotion, my husband has been dragging me around to various CPKs around California. This particular one seemed similar to the others. Our server was Cole, and this review is mainly about him.  He seemed a little fake, a little TOO cheery. I know this is true because while I am a difficult customer, my husband is NOT. He was a server for 5 years and thus always gives servers a break. Yet my husband was the one who commented on the fake server.  The evening took a turn for the worse when I heard our server loudly talking to a nearby table. He told them that he was giving them 20% off the bill and he essentially told them that he thought they were ""super cool"" people and he has discretion to give up to 20% because the manager allows it. However, he stated that the REASON the manager allows it is because sometimes people complain and the manager doesnt have time to deal with every complaint, so servers have discretion. He then clarified that even though THIS table didn't complain, he liked them and gave them a discount.  Keep in mind, the promotion I referred to above was like a game thing where my husband and I won 20% off, so to hear that this server was just giving it away was irritating. Also nevermind the fact that Cole the server NEVER came back to ask (1) how our food was or (2) if we needed anything. We waited because our drinks sat empty for 20 minutes. 20!!! That pissed off my husband. He didn't mind the 20% discount to the other table and the constant talking to them, but he did mind that we were IGNORED so that Cole could talk to his new friends.  As such, we left a 10% tip (which my dear husband NEVER does) and will not be returning to this location.

Jonny A.,"Fremont, CA",213,287,252,3.0,1/3/2011,"My first visit to a CPK, can you believe? I haven't avoided this place at all -- in fact, pizza is one of my favorite things to eat (shut up, I know I sound like a kid) -- I've just never been with people who have said, ""hey, let's go eat CPK!"" To start off, the wait estimate given to us was about 45 minutes, on a Monday evening, the day after Christmas. This didn't bother me truthfully, considering the restaurant appeared to be quite small, and the rest of our party (we were 6) were not there yet. I didn't keep track of the actual wait but it felt a lot less than 45 minutes. Our server, Cole, greeted us and took our drink order. He appeared to be very polite and well versed in his job. I ordered their original BBQ Chicken Pizza and I have to say it was INCREDIBLE! For a chain restaurant making pizza, they've locked down this so-called signature pizza of theirs. You bet I finished every slice! I felt pretty full afterward and didn't order dessert. Neither did anyone else. Now, here's where I begin the negative aspects. Throughout dinner, Cole wasn't around much. I noticed he was also bartending for the evening, which I can understand is a consuming aspect, but if you know you're going to be swamped, ask for help. My friends and I were in need of refills for our drinks, and Cole finally got them towards the end of the meal. This is a huge pet peeve of mine, but considering how much fun I was having with my friends, I didn't let it get to me. In fact, I originally planned to omit this part of the review. However, things only fell flat after this. Cole brought out our check WITHOUT REMOVING A SINGLE PLATE FROM THE TABLE. I tried to give him an appalling look, but I don't think he got it. We had dishes everywhere and I KNOW Cole saw we had a Christmas gift exchange planned for after dinner because he sure seemed attentive to the lady with the baby at the table right next to us (we all assumed it was his wife/girlfriend/someone important), and our gifts were on the booth-side of the table, right ON the seat NEXT to her. Even if we didn't have a gift exchange planned  -- even if it was just me eating by myself -- YOU NEVER DROP A CHECK WITHOUT BUSSING YOUR TABLE FIRST. If serving had a holy book of sorts, that would be a commandment.  So now, here we are in a cluttered mess trying to sort out how we're going to pay (some of us have card, some of us have cash) and after a good 10 minutes, Cole comes to check on us to see if we're ready. We tell him no and I think it finally sets into him that he hasn't done his job -- or completed it, rather -- as he starts lifting plates in the stacks that WE put in the center of the table for him. Yeah, THAT caught his attention. Anyway, our gift exchange process was a quick one as we had after-dinner plans (we're not cupcakers) and I believe we left him a less than deserving tip. I am NOT proud of this, trust me, he started off great and even kept his charm 'til the very end, but you just don't treat a party like that. It's disrespectful -- it says to me, ""I don't give a damn about you so I'm going to let you sit in your filth until it bothers you enough to leave,"" more or less. 3 1/2 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=160

Barbara S.,"San Jose, CA",2,74,167,4.0,10/19/2013,"In the past, I would have given this restaurant 5 stars for their service alone.  They would have you seated right away, have bread and water on your table within 2 minutes, have your order within 5 minutes, and have your order on your table within another 5-7 minutes.  I held them as the standard for some restaurants that were near me with lousy service, that I gave up on.  Unfortunately, the service at CPK has slackened off dramatically.  I've now sat trying to get a waiter's attention, or my order, for extremely lengthy periods of time, while watching the manager standing, chatting away with 2 men at a table right next to me.  Now, I have to ask for items multiple times, and have had some frustrating experiences.  Once, in the past, my waiter asked if I'd like the rest of my salad boxed up, which I had about 1/4 remaining.  I told him yes, but when he wanted to box it himself, I pointed out what looked to be an eyelash, and said I didn't want that in my salad, since he wasn't letting me box it myself.  I wasn't actually complaining; however, next I knew, the waiter brought me out a boxed up full salad that was freshly made to take home.  That type of service for even minor issues, was impressive.  Now, CPK seems to be lacking in their past service, and don't seem to do much to make up for their much lower level of service or issues.  But, because of their much higher standards in the past, I'm averaging them out for now.   As for the food... it is good.  Some good salads, some unique pizzas, and I like their new cedar plank salmon.  Because parking at this mall is atrocious, I will most often call in an order and park in their 10 minute spaces, and pick up the meal.   I'm sad to see CPK's former superior service drop so much, as I think of great service as a very key component of the dining experience.  I'm keeping their rating at a 4 for now, in the hopes that it is just a blip, and will soon be back up to scratch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=160

Besides that service is pretty good. They have a bunch of pizzas to choose from, so there should be something for everybody! Tortilla Spring Rolls - You MUST try at least once. I pretty much come here for these and the pizza is an afterthought. It comes with 6 rolls, and you can choose 2 kinds. I stick to Baja Chicken and Thai Chicken. I think I slightly prefer the Baja Chicken, but the Thai Chicken comes with this AMAZING peanut sauce. I always ask for extra sauce, and I never let the server take it away from me. After I finish the rolls, I dip my free bread in the sauce.  Besides the rolls I usually get either the Thai Chicken or Jamaican Jerk pizza. Both are good, but the rolls are really my favorite part of eating at CPK.  Try to save room for dessert!

Shavaun P.,"San Jose, CA",68,19,1,1.0,5/10/2015,"Brought my family of 5 here for dinner to be competly disappointed. We have always LOVED the California Pizza Kitchen at Oakridge. We were on the west side of town and decided to give the Valley Fair location a try. This location does not serve some of the all time favorite items including the raviollis along with the tiramisu. After we ordered and waited 15 mins we asked for the bread we normally enjoy at the Oakridge location and we were told they had no bread. I was sitting with 3 starving teenagers for 35 mins. The waiter said he would bring his manger, which she told 20 mins to come to the table. when she arrived her attitude was OUT OF THIS WORLD, she was sarcastic and practically yelling. She stated that the bread is a free/complementary item so I basically should not be suprised by the fact that they are out. When I asked if there was anything (chips/crackers) they could bring for the kids to snack on until the food was ready, as we had been waiting quite some time and the kids were very hungry. She said I was welcome to order an appetizer, which would then need to be made in the kitchen. I went on Yelp to look if this location has these types of reviews. The manager looked over at my phone screen and then stated ""Don't threaten to write a review on Yelp"". This highly upset our grandmother who said that we did not say anything, but we do have the right to write a review on yelp. We asked that the manager not return to our table because her attitude and tone of voice was aggressive at the point. She returned to our table twice after that. Firstly time to show me the time that our order was entered in there system, then she came to deliver our food. I guess it was the mangers way of making herself feel in charge. We ate and quickly left. On our way out we noticed a few other tables were having issues. One demanding to speak to a different manager. My family will avoid CPK at Valley Fair at all costs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=120

Don't get me wrong, I like kids; but I honestly felt like i was at a chucky cheeses. The line was extremely long; but luckily, we called in an hour ahead of time to put our names on the wait list. Our table was all set when we arrived! :)) - Crispy Mac 'N' Cheese wasn't alllll that. One thing i hate about mac n' cheese is when it gets cold and the cheese hardens up. That pretty such sums up this dish; but in patty form...and deep fried.  - Korean BBQ Steak Tacos were pretty good. The spicy sauce they have on top really brought the whole dish together. On the other hand, just eating the meat alone, it had a consistency of really low grade meat...no bueno :( - Caramelized Peach  Salad was yummm(: i love fruit in my salad and the peaches and cranberries were definitely a hit for me. I think they put a little too much Gorgonzola cheese but other than that, i was still a happy camper! - Norwegian Atlantic Salmon wasn't as great as i expected it to be. The pasta was really bland and i had to add tons of salt & pepper, even lemon juice. My salmon was overcooked and it had a hard layer all around the fish... like they pan fried it for so long the sides turned hard.  Its a sad thing when the salads are better than the entrees.

On a positive note, I love the smashed pea and barley soup, and some of the pizzas are okay.  I almost prefer the frozen versions, as I get to enjoy those in the comfort of my own home (and not freeze to death).  CPK is famous among moms and expectant moms, and moms who are both.  So, if you are averse to screaming children and big bellies, avoid weekday lunches here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=120
Lena P.,"Milpitas, CA",168,24,8,2.0,8/25/2011,"First off, the customer service here is HORRIBLE. There were barely any people in the restaurant and the weather was nice outside, so we asked the lady at the front desk if we could sit outside. For a party of 6 people, that shouldn't be a problem! She reluctantly told us that ""the tables outside were closed,"" but we just smiled and told her we wanted to sit outside anyways, and she couldn't do anything but agree with us. Our waiter was this Mexican, kinda big guy with glasses and a slightly feminine voice. I forgot his name, but he was SO unfriendly and sarcastic and it wasn't funny at all. My friends and I are always joking around so yes, ""we can take a joke"" but this guy was just so grumpy and bitchy. We all just ignored his attitude and just continued on chit chatting while waiting for our food. When the waiter came back to give us our drinks, he cracked another stupid joke that came out to be kind of rude and offensive to all of us, so we didn't say anything in return. Our food came and he seemed impatient when serving our Parmesan cheese. This totally ruined my mood and appetite so I ended up not finishing my dish. To top that off, he barely came back to check up on our table. Every time he did, he gave us a huge attitude. When it was time to pay, I asked him if it was okay to split the bill into three parts. He rudely asked, ""HOW?"" And I rudely answered, ""UH, by couples."" He rolled his eyes and walked away. He packed our to-go plates for us and didn't even say thank you or come again or whatever. My friends and I wanted a group picture, so one of my girlfriends went back into the restaurant to ask the same waiter to take a picture for us. She was in there for a while. When she finally came out, ANOTHER waitress was offering to take a picture for us when my friend specifically asked HIM to come out... Wtf? This was the first time EVER that I felt like not tipping (even though I was nice enough to tip anyway) simply because the service here was SO bad. I recommend going to the CPK at Valley Fair because their service and staff are so much friendlier and funnier! 1 star for the food and another star for the nice waitress who took pictures for us.

We had to try and flag him down since he wasn't very good with checking in with us and had to wait forever even to get a water refill. When my mom was ordering her food she asked for a salad with grilled shrimp. He even said ""okay a salad with chicken"" no sir... I said shrimp. And he repeated it back the second time, ""Okay great, a salad with shrimp."" So you would expect it to be right once it came to the table. Nope, instead it still had chicken. So we had him take it back and get shrimp which took a while because it had to be grilled. Second time around and now there was no dressing on the lettuce.

Stacy M.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,2.0,8/10/2015,"Came in to Cpk Friday night after about 6 months of not dinning here. My family and I were avid fans of this location for many years but after our last experience I will not be going back. First and for most the whole staff has done a complete 360. The food had always been mediocre but the staff had always been the reason why we returned time and time again. We came mostly for Joyce and Ginger. Both amazing bartenders with the sweetest dispositions. I can't even begin to explain the service we encountered this last weekend. I will not mention a name because I'm not in the business of getting anyone in trouble, but for one we sat for nearly 10 minutes without even so much as a acknowledgment. Once we were greeted our drinks took another 10 minutes. Not to mention our waiter knew nothing about the menu and it showed. Our appetizers came out the same time as our food and all he could say was it happens like that quite often. WTH. On top of that my family and I listened to a whole conversation  our server was having with another co worker that was not only inappropriate but rather offensive. We then proceeded to ask about our two favorite girls and our waiter told us that one had moved to LA and the other was fired and proceeded to tell us the story as if it was breaking news. I'm sorry but a simple they don't work here anymore would have sufficed yet they continued on with this defamation of character that made me feel almost uncomfortable. Little did they know my family and I still are loyal regulars of hers. Between the tardiness of our food and the lack professionalism we asked to speak to a manager. But it seemed as if we were being rushed out of the door by our server and we're told the manager was very busy and then another server came over to ask if there was anything they could do for us. We're we supposed to believe that this young child like girl was the manager. We payed our bill and left never to return. If your really craving CPK I recommend the Valley Fair store.

Nikki C.,"Sacramento, CA",103,212,9,3.0,9/21/2008,"So, funny story.  Let's rewind back five years to my senior year in high school.  I was going out to dinner with a boy I liked, and I was nervous about it, because I didn't know if it was a ""date"" or not.  My friends all told me that if he paid, it was a date.... Long story short, on our trip here (five years ago), our pizzas ended up taking awhile to come out... Annnnnd, the manager comped our meal.  Great, except it really didn't answer my ""date"" question.  The boy DID pay the tip though!! So why am I telling you this?  Well, fast forward five years.  I visited CPK yesterday with my boyfriend (no, not the same boy... I don't think he though it was a date after all, haha...), and he ordered a barbecue chicken pizza with no onions.  When our pizzas came out, his had onions on it.  After this was fixed, and the manager and two other servers apologized, we ate, and the waitress brought out the bill and told us they took the pizza off the bill because of the mix-up. So my point?  This California pizza kitchen is pretty good about compensating for mistakes!! So, the pizzas here are pretty good, though I've come to realize that with the sweetness of their crust and their sauce, meat doesn't really WORK with their pizzas.  It's just an odd combination.. I recommend NOT getting a traditional type of pizza here (like pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom).  My favorite pizza is the five cheese and tomato. Also, service can be pretty off here.  If they screw up your pizzas, they DO compensate, BUT... If not, don't expect good service.  After they brought our pizzas out the other day, then took my boyfriend's back, I wanted parmesean cheese.  I looked and looked for our waitress, and then ANYONE to bring it, but no one came close... So, my boyfriend ended up walking up to the kitchen area and asking.   CPK is okay, and I definitely eat here every once in awhile, but it's definitely not my favorite pizza place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=220

I used to stick to the Wild Mushroom (with chicken) each time, until I started alternating between that and their Peking Duck pizza.  Then, after that was pulled off the menu (possibly replaced by the Tandoori Chicken?), I gave the Vegetarian with Japanese Eggplant a try, and have alternated between that and the Wild Mushroom since.  Although the Vegetarian with Japanese Eggplant probably isn't for everyone, I highly recommend it for anyone who's looking for a health(ier) pizza, and who doesn't mind going without meat.  Besides eggplant, it's topped with sundried tomatoes, baby broccoli, corn, onions, and mushrooms.  It's available on honeywheat dough, but I tried that once and didn't enjoy it. The Wild Mushroom is excellent for mushroom lovers (obviously), as it contains four different mushrooms.  It goes well with chicken added, which I go for about half the time. I've never had any of their pastas here, as I figure if I wanted pasta, I could step next door to Buca di Beppo or Cheesecake Factory.  I'm here for one thing only--pizza. Another plus is their offerings of differently flavored lemonade (peach lemonade is just a tad too sweet), iced tea (peach iced tea is great), and Italian soda (peach soda was good until I cut sodas out of my diet). On this particular occasion, the first thing I noticed when we walked in was the unenthusiastic hostess we were greeted by.  She didn't seem to be having a good day, but was making no effort to hide it.  After we sat, we waited about five minutes before our server swung be to say that she'd be right with us.  We waited about another five minutes before she came back.  As I have previously stated, I'm not too picky about restaurant service and don't get upset by three-star service--I simply feel I should mention it when I write a posting. When our pizzas came out, mine was only lukewarm, not piping-hot as I have often had mine here.  I understand that different pizzas take different amounts of time to cook, but perhaps keeping all pizzas hot until they are served would be something to consider.  The more important thing was that my Vegetarian with Japanese Eggplant was good, as it always is.  The server, meanwhile, did come by once, about ten minutes after bringing us our pizzas.  We didn't see her again until she dropped the check off.  All in all, certainly not a fine dining experience, but a relaxed, family atmosphere that offers a wide variety of pizzas--hopefully something for everyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=220

Lynn H.,"San Jose, CA",77,183,48,4.0,4/19/2008,"Food - 3.5 Service - 3 Ambience - 3 The food is pretty reliable here and I've tried many a specials and have been pleased. Can't go wrong with the Original BBQ Chicken pizza; it's an old stand-by. I also enjoy the following pizzas: - Wild Mushroom - Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage - Sweet & Spicy Italian Sausage - Thai Chicken From the pasta section, I enjoy: - Jambalaya - Grilled Sausage & Penne - Kung Pao Spaghetti Last night, I tried the Blue Crab Cakes special - ""Made from blue crab, pan-sauted and served with our homemade remoulade sauce. Accompanied with fresh grilled asparagus and spaghettini in a creamy lemon-caper sauce."" The crab cakes were quite cooked, nicely pan seared with chunks of crabs without too much filler. The spaghettini and asparagus were nice accompaniments, but in the end, I think I would just order the blue crab cake appetizers for $7 less. I didn't think the pasta & asparagus was worth the extra $7. The last few times we've been there, I've had to ask for the bread and it usually arrived minutes before our entree, which sort of defeats the purpose of a pre-meal bread, in my eyes. Overall, this is a solid location for dinner before a movie or just a random night. We often have luck getting a table in under 20 minutes at this location, even on the weekends, especially when Cheesecake Factory wait time is 2 hours plus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=220
bernadette p.,"Sunnyvale, CA",3,8,7,2.0,1/13/2010,Been here a couple of times with my cousin to be honest I really dont like this place. They do have good customer service but when ever I order pizza it doesnt taste good. The second time I went there with my girl cousin I asked our waiter which pizza he recommends and he told me the goat cheese with roasted peppers. I get it and think that itll be good cause i love goat cheese on pizza. Got it withing 10-14 mins took a bite and was ok. Kept eating the same slice and it was gross i think it was the japanes eggplant. only ate 2 slices and asked for a box same with my cousins pizza. So our waiter took our plates and came back with the box. Paid our bill and left.  This is the stupidest shit ever because my cousin open both boxes to c which one was hers and when she found her box  the pizza crust that she didnt eat was put in the box. You may think the guy was being nice n courteous but its common sense if the crust was put aside theres a reason for that...Sorry but our server was dumb in the brains for doing that,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=220

Melanie C.,"San Jose, CA",81,279,50,2.0,8/14/2005,"Atmospere is your standard CPK.  The waitress knew most of the soups were not vegetarian. However, the service stunk.  The place was nearly empty, so it really souldn't have been a problem, but it was quite slow.   The food was tasty, as usual.  I had ordered the split pea soup.  THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY CRACKERS to go with my soup! They also had no bacon for the pizza my friend ordered.  She asked if she could get the pizza at a reduced price, since the bacon was sort of a main ingredient, and the waitress, hesitating, said no.  If she really didn't know, she should have gone to check with someone more knowledgeable. So, my friend asked for more fresh mazarella in place of the bacon.  She coudln't find any fresh mozarella at all on her pizza. I was thoroughly unimpressed. EDIT I've been here a couple more times since my last review, so thought it was time to update. On one occasion, the service was okay.  But I was essentially double-charged for my drink.  If I order a rum and coke, just because it's not on the menu, does not mean I should be charged $6 for a shot of rum and then $3 for the coke.  All the mixed drinks on the menu with more alcohol in them are cheaper than that! This last time, service was again awful.  I was looking forward to the bread, but none was ever brought.  We sat waiting for a long time after our meal to get a drink refill.  After about 15 minutes of the waitress standing at the bar, she finally decides to come tell us that she is off duty. Sad, really.  The pizzas are good, but why is service such a problem?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=220

Pros... - The Hawaiian pizza is great (try their thin neopolitan-style crust). - The restaurant is clean. - There was no waiting to get in at 7:00 on a Thursday night (not sure how it is on the weekends). Cons... - The Margherita (I spelled that wrong) pizza was overcooked.  I guess we could have sent it back, but we just had to nibble around the extra crispy parts.  =) The pizza, in my opinion, cannot hold a candle to Pizza My Heart, but it is a good alternative.  I'll be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=220
Diana Y.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,2.0,7/2/2014,"This is the second time I've gone to this restaurant. Last time, I had a sandwich that was pretty decent. This time I decided I should have one of the pizzas. Since the word pizza is in the name of the restaurant, you'd think those would be particularly good. Wrong. I ordered the Hawaiian (my favorite and a simple one to make so it should be good). What I got was extremely disappointing. Barely enough ingredients to cover the bland sauce underneath. The ham was sliced so thin there were holes in it. There were probably a total of 8 small pieces of pineapple (1 per slice). I think there might have been some cheese, but didn't have my microscope with me to verify. The sauce had absolutely no flavor. To top it off, it arrived cold. It seemed as though it had been sitting on a table in the back area, placed on a cold plate and served. I started eating it because I was with friends and didn't look at it closely when it arrived. After a few bites, I just stopped eating and talked to them instead. I brought the leftovers home, but tossed it in the garbage.

Naiyah P.,"San Jose, CA",324,51,7,5.0,11/24/2010,"I've been going here for a few years. I also tried their other location in the Livermore mall. One of the best pizzas in the world is right here: the Sicilian!!! OMG. It's so freakin good. Super thin crust. It's crunchy, with mouth-watering peperoni and canadian bacon; topped with aromatic basil. It's perfect the way it is. All their other pizzas are okay. I've tried 80% of the menu. Half of their salads are amazing (forgot their names; they aren't catchy), with great portions to boot. Their cocktails could be better; too many drinks with too much sugar (maybe thats what the crowd likes). The service has always been a solid 4-star. Because half their salads are so tasty, they get a 4.5 (I tend to eat healthy). Normally, if only one pizza is great, and the rest are bleh - they would get a 2.5. But this Sicilian is a HARD 5. So, overall, it's going to be a 4 for the joint. They also have pastas and such for people who don't care for pizza. I actually heard that one of them is extraordinary. Kudos for having variety. I don't know how you can't like this place. Order their Sicilian. Order their Chicken Waldorf Salad. Order a strawberry mojito. 5 stars for genius food and selection.

Abi U.,"Fremont, CA",228,304,3,4.0,8/25/2008,"I hate the parking here. It's not CPK's fault so I don't blame them but when you pull into the lot there are people directing you where to go in full on orange vests and flashlights. Crazy! I didn't know Oakridge got so busy. Parking takes a while to find so if you are planning on heading out leave early bc seriously parking sucks :[.  I came by Saturday evening with a party of 6. The wait was about 45 minutes and I could see why, they were PACKED. Before that night I had never had CPK but I did hear a lot of raves about it from my coworkers who have had a lot of team building lunches there. The hosts seemed really stressed out. They weren't smiling and they seemed really focused trying to get the wait times right and people out. Again, this place was PACKED. There's seating outside in the patio area, tables and booths, and chairs available at the bar/counter area (I don't know what to call it... but you can see the ovens and everything). Everything was filled!! I really feel for the hosts, looks like they have a lot to handle on the weekends.  Once seated our waitress took our drink orders and let us browse the menu. Geez there's soooo much pizza! I didn't know what to pick so I ended up not even getting a pizza :[. I picked the Miso Seafood Salad which was good but I've had better. Pretty filling for a salad though and they do have a lot of salad options for you vegetarians out there. My BF had the Chicken Marsala and it was soooooooooooooooo good. REALLY good!! I should've ordered that but I didn't think I could finish it all. YUMMMM! My friends got the Garlic Chicken pizza I think it was? That was good too. I can see why people go crazy for the pizza. My strawberry itallian soda was ok and my BF's mango lemonade was great, better than the mango lemonade at Chevy's. WAY BETTER. Looks like I should have ordered what he ordered. Haha.  The waitress was polite and friendly. Even the manager (I think it was the manager, she was dressed differently) came to our table to ask how things were. You can tell there's a lot of effort here but they're just so darn busy that it almost makes your experience uncomfy without them doing anything wrong.

We cut up their pizza into small slices and they take care of themselves, for the most part. :) The restaurant is definitely kid-friendly, according to our expectations anyway. There are two negatives about this CPK: 1. Tables near the bathrooms smell like the bathrooms, so request a different table if you are sensitive to smells. Somehow the design of the interior space creates a draft from the bathrooms out to the tables. 2. You have to be proactive with your server. The bread rarely comes without asking for it.  Be very clear and extra clear about your order.. especially any differences from the standard menu item. Don't be timid about asking for things.. then your experience will be smooth.  You will have a great experience if you stay on top of your server.

She graciously took our orders, brought us drinks and bread appetizers to get started. My wife and daughters loved this place. Pizzas tasted great! My wife ordered a side Caesar salad. Tasted good.

Their other interesting forms of fusion pastas and cuisine don't sound good either. Not only did they not sound good, but I was very unimpressed with what I got. It's actually difficult to even remember what I got.  I have eaten here twice now. I know the first time I got something with fresh basil that needed a magnifying glass in order to identify any fresh basil in it. I think I ordered the same thing the next time I went as their menu just doesn't appeal to me.  Average food at an average place with absolutely terrible parking!

Steph N.,"Campbell, CA",0,9,2,2.0,1/8/2011,"My friends and I were planning on seeing a movie at oakridge, so we opted to eat at the pizza kitchen. Being a Thursday night, it was not very busy. Despite this, service was S.L.O.W.(arrived at 7:15, didn't leave until 9:30). We ordered appetizers, pizzas and drinks which we were satisfied with once they managed to make it to our table. Here is the kicker: we ask for the check which totals $70. Although the service was slow, we didn't blame that on the waitress, who was actually pretty nice the whole time. We tipped her $15 (tax was roughly $6). She took the check, then returned a few minutes later saying ""Ohhh, it looks like you guys only gave me $85- you underpaid, the bill is $92""  We apologized to her, and said we weren't sure how we could have misread the bill. As my friends are pulling out their wallets, I notice that the bill has gone up because the waitress forgot to add on two of the five drinks we had ordered. So she could have said ""I'm sorry guys, I calculated your bill incorrectly"", but she tried to tell us that WE underpaid HER. Granted, I had had a couple of drinks and was probably a little more pissed about it than I should have been, but we tipped her well based on our first bill, and she couldn't even be honest, and just slipped the higher bill in there. We asked for the manager who was very nice and understood that she made a mistake. Minus one star for slow service, minus two stars for the waitress who suddenly was throwing dirty looks our way after her error was brought to light, and plus two stars for the nice manager.

Thomas C.,"Santa Clara, CA",277,96,5,4.0,5/20/2009,"Price:  I think the prices are fair.  I can see how it may add up if you get appetizers (that cost just as much as the pizza) and drinks.  I think you get what you pay for. Service:  I think this was the reason I went from a possible 3 star to a 4 star.  My friends and I arrived a little later after a beach trip and noticed that many people weren't there.  We found parking right in front of the restaurant at Oakridge, which is a miracle.  Made sense since they were closing.  Even still, they gave us exceptional service and catered to all our needs.  It kind of killed it seeing every clean everything around you, making you feel a little guilty, but they didn't pressure us to hurry up and finish.  The waitress was very friendly and made sure we enjoyed the experience. Taste:  I'm sure what you choose to order and eat will make a huge difference in the taste you experience.  I can't say I've been here enough to know what's good and what's not.  I had the chipotle pizza and I was a little disappointed.  Part of the reason being that they ran out of the special salsa you would put on there.  It was basically a pizza with chicken and the chipotle sauce (that wasn't even that spicy - since I asked fora  spicy pizza).  I had to add hot sauce, corn, and black beans myself to make it better (that's the disappointing part - I had to enhance their recipe).  The waitress did give me some assurance by offering to take it off the bill if it wasn't up to my standards.  After finishing the whole pizza, I felt it would've been wrong to say I didn't enjoy it.  I do have to add that I've tried the CPK frozen pizzas that you can buy at the grocery stores and the taste is mighty similar (food for thought). Atmosphere:  It was a nice relaxing atmosphere.  Soft music in the background, comfortable seats, and tv's near the bar.  They also had some cool art work made out of the CPK pizza boxes.  They are all displayed on the walls.  Very creative and original. What You'll Remember:  For being a pizza place, they sure have a lot on their menu.  It may take a while to figure out what you want to order. Comment:  This wasn't the most amazing pizza I've had.  I think I've been more satisfied with delivery and some beer.  They do have some interesting choices of flavor and toppings.  Like I mentioned, as I was eating the pizza at the restaurant, I couldn't help but think it tasted awfully the same as the CPK frozen pizza I had from safeway.  Maybe I had too much sun that day...  Let me know if you come across that thought as well :) Cheers, T-Chung",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=240

We were sitting at our table for awhile till somebody could tear away from their busy conversations around the bar area to greet us.   My boyfriend and I already knew what we wanted to eat given the extra time so decided to order our food along with the drinks.  Well our waitress brings our drinks awhile later and let's us know that our food should be coming. Well that was a big fat lie.  I don't know if they were growing the food back in the kitchen but that's what it seemed like because our food took forever to come out.  On top of that our waitress never gives us bread or refills for our drinks.  Funny thing is that I'm a slow eater and drinker.   After much conversation with my boyfriend about leaving and just paying for the drinks he convinces me to wait it out.    Our food finally comes out from someone else besides our waitress and I don't see her till we are too full to finish our meals.  Never did she come to our table to ask if we needed anything.  We had to flag down another waiter to get our drinks refilled.  Huge mistake in terms of service especially for someone who's worked the same job as she had once upon a time.   So our waitress finally shows up to give us the bill and I immediately hand over the c/c for fear she will disappear once again.  She comes hands us the receipts and disappears again.  Unfortunately, for us we forget to ask her for some boxes for the unfinished food.  Once again we were at the mercy of someone else besides our waitress to get us some boxes.  The whole time she was sitting down deep in conversation with another waitress in the back of the restaurant with clear view of us if she had a mindful eye.  Extremely irritated I did not want to leave her a tip.  However, my boyfriend was the one who paid the bill and did not want to stiff her.  It's not in his nature to ever complain or stiff someone even for bad service.  We talked about it and both decided to leave her a tip but a small tip.   I can honestly say I will never come back to this location.  I'd rather go to the Stevens Creek location where I've eaten a dozen times and have never had one bad service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=260

Eddie Y.,"San Jose, CA",2,43,,1.0,3/29/2010,"I've eaten here a few times (and at other locations) and typically we have good service and good food... but, I guess there's always that ONE time you go.. .and...  We went here for a quick bite to eat, it was a Monday evening.  We arrived around 7:30pm (ish).  When we arrived we were promptly greeted and seated.  And that's about the only thing that went right at this place.   Let me break down what happened in point form here: 1.  No server came by to introduce themselves, offer water, offer bread, etc... the usual stuff.  We had to wait 20 minutes before I got so fed up with waiting that I grabbed the first server that made eye contact with me (not literally grabbed.. cuz that would be weird and wrong).  She wasn't our server, but she was kind enough to take our order (I'll refer to her as our temp server going forward).  As soon as she left, our server decided to pop in and introduce himself.  (great timing).  He made some excuse about how they had sent someone home early and he didn't know we were seated in his area, since it was expanded to cover the guy that left.  I think that's a load of shit.  Then he disappeared. 2.  Our server, even our temp server who took our order, did not offer us any bread while we waited (which is fine, it's the thought that counts here guys). 3. We wait another 15 - 20 minutes for our appetizers.  Meanwhile, people who are seated after us are getting their appetizers... bread... AND entres...   The temp server came by to let us know that our food will be out in a minute (which was again nice)  Our actual server?  huh?  Where the hell is he? 4. Appetizers come out, we ordered their advertised deep fried artichoke hearts.  Terrible, not worth the $4.  There were literally 5 pieces that were smaller than my ....baby toe.  And they were over cooked. 5. Pizza's came in really quickly after our appetizers, so we were scrambling for table space. 6. Pizza's... ready for this?... NOT cut.  at all.  So I had to cut it with a knife (again, it's the little things right?) 7. Server comes by to check on us (way later in the meal, and after the floor manager did his rounds to check on us).  He was standing there with a full carafe of water... yet he did not fill our glasses or even ask to see if we wanted to have our water filled.... then he left.  We later flagged him down for some water refills... 8. We waited another 20 minutes for the manager to notice that we were finished eating.  Our server?  He was eating at another booth with another worker, I guess when they go on break they go on break, and the customer has to wait for them?  C'mon...  We obviously didn't tip the guy (argue all you want about mandatory tipping... because that's another argument.. and you won't win).  As we left I went to the manager to discuss our issues, so that at least he could address it with his employees.  He offered his apologies and offered us 20% off our bill, which was a nice gesture, but I refused.  I'm not one of those guys that complains about the food/service to get a free meal.  Hell if I was, I'd have brought a severed finger and complained about a finger being cooked into my chili...

Shauna S.,"Campbell, CA",420,240,621,3.0,7/2/2015,"CPK typically doesn't disappoint. If you like great salads and fun pizzas, it is definitely a good spot. Because it's a chain, you grow to expect the same things at each restaurant. One of those things is good service. The food at this restaurant was great, everything was amazing. I love all their salads and their pizzas are so unique and trendy (even if I always want the BBQ chicken).  Our experience here was pretty poor. We had no problem until after we ordered our dinner. Our server never came back, and we were left without drinks, then without a bill, and had to go in search of someone so we could pay. It really was disappointing. We ended up contacting the bartender and were given our bill, paid, and left, all without coming in contact with our server. Just bad!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=40

Chris A.,"San Jose, CA",4998,745,1908,3.0,2/18/2015,"Not my go to spot for pizza, but since we were in the area and it was getting late I decided to dine-in.  I had an order of the baja chicken tortilla spring rolls for starters and pizza for the main course. The appetizer was the best part of the meal, the guacamole it came with was awesome.  Unfortunately the pizza was not that great, probably a bad selection on I choice but when I ordered the waitress added ""good choice"". It was far from it, the actual pizza isn't the problem cause it was seasoned well but the sauce ruined it, just overpoweringly sweet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=40
Sonia G.,"San Jose, CA",255,296,480,3.0,1/18/2016,"Came here during lunch rush hour on MLK day. Mall was insane. California Pizza Kitchen was packed but they sat us within 10 minutes. We sat down and were ignored for about 10 minutes. We finally flagged down a waitress to ask if they can take our drink order. We asked for water and she said she would bring it right out. All of the waitresses looked stressed out. Two managers were walking around helping pass out food to customers. One of the managers noticed us and asked if he can take our drink order and said our waitress would be right with us. We were a bit confused since we already ordered our waters. Anyways, we said we were ready to place our orders. He was very pleasant, and took down our orders. The waitress came back with our waters and said, sorry, I know our manager already took your order. Sorry about the other waitress but I guess I will be your waitress now. Your food will be right out, is there anything else I can get you? We told her no, we were fine. As a customer, I have no idea what is happening behind the scenes. Although its apparent, everyone looks stressed out, we have not officially met our waitress who is suppose to be assigned to us- and how were we suppose to know? I thought all of that was unnecessary. Just give us our drinks, and our food. The waitress was very pleasant, and nice the whole time. Service was ok- we did not need a lot of the explanation of  another waitress who was suppose to be serving us or the behind the scenes miscommunication, blah, blah, blah. I don't know about the customer service today, it was kind of all over the place, but they got it together as the restaurant slowed down.  Food was alright. I ordered the tortilla soup and the italian sandwich. I guess it is my fault for not ordering the restaurants specialty- pizza. My friend enjoyed her chicken caesar salad. The Italian sandwich was gross. The sandwich was flimsy and I wish I had ordered something else. I probably should have returned it, and ordered something different, but I ended up picking at the sandwich and only eating half (not including the bread).  Maybe my taste buds are changing as I get older, but I am just not too crazy about CPK anymore. Food is overpriced, and not worth, mediocre food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=40
Rheanna V.,"Fairgrounds, San Jose, CA",14,92,206,4.0,6/17/2015,"Came in around 5:30pm on a Wednesday evening. Got seated right away & got our orders taken. I ordered their new drink which is the strawberry mango cooler, it very refreshing. Especially for this hot summer weather.  As my entree I had ordered the four cheese ravioli, I usually go for their regular chicken pastas but I thought I should give this a try.  At first glance the plating seemed a bit small, looked like 10 pieces of ravioli. It seemed more of a little snack for me but I suppose it was a good portion. The seasoning and the overall taste of it was very good. Highly recommended.  Also got the red velvet slice as dessert, opted out for the optional ice cream side. The red velvet was nice and moist & was a decent sized portion. The frosting is delectable as well",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=40

Very pleasantly surprised when my husband and I were looking for a last minute dinner on a whim and tried two other restaurants at the mall near where we were running errands and they both had a 30 min wait. Decided to try California Pizza Kitchen - no waiting, fantastic Moscow miles and hand shaken agave mojito's, the special wild mushroom rolled pasta - couldn't get enough of that taste! An asparagus and arugula small plate salad with shaved Parmesan, sun dried tomatoes and peanuts was the perfect accompaniment and the right size to share.

Marc R.,"San Jose, CA",862,174,621,3.0,6/25/2014,"Well, of course I can only rate a chain restaurant like CPK a 3-star, especially since I've had some really good pizza in my life like Chicago deep dish pizza, and a few great NY pizza slices. As everyone else does when they go to CPK, we always order the Original BBQ Chicken Pizza (rate a 3/5) for $13.59. I remember it being a lot better when I was younger. Not sure if it just had something to do with this particular location that we visited about a week and a half ago for my little brother's college graduation celebration. Anyway, it's the standard order when we go to a CPK, which by the way, we haven't visited one in like... over 2.5 years. Anyway, the other pizza that I really like is a lesser known one, the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Pizza, which is listed on the thin-crust pizza section, but you can get it hand-tossed, which is what we did. I'd rate this pizza a 3.5/5, and it costs the same as the BBQ Chicken Pizza ($13.59). The Jamaican Jerk has a little bit of a kick to it, which we like. With all of the pizzas, we like to order a side of ranch to dip our crust, because the crust by itself doesn't taste like anything. We went with a group of 11 people, and each of us pretty much ordered an individual pizza, so we definitely ran the bill up. I personally think that the pizzas are a little pricey at almost $14 a pizza for 6 pretty small slices. But I guess that's just inflation.  In terms of service, our server wasn't the best. She didn't really know much about the pizzas and she definitely wasn't in the best of moods, and it didn't seem to put in an extra effort handling a larger group. Oh well, I guess.  We probably won't be going back to a CPK for a while, but I always enjoy those 2 pizzas, even though they are a little expensive in my books. Service could certainly use an upgrade, but all in all, CPK is always a fun, casual location to hang out with family and friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=40
