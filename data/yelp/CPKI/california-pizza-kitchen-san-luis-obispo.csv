Helen D.,"Santa Barbara, CA",459,1113,27692,3.0,1/9/2018,"Wasn't feeling it this last Sunday. From hostess to server... it was like they didn't wanna help us. My mom was craving their pizza n salad, that was why we stopped in after the movie. The roasted veggie salad was still pretty good. The veggie pizza was dry n totally blah. The charred shishito peppers we started with were pretty good. Hated the service. Felt like it was just our group being treated this way. My brother n cousin didn't order anything cuz they didn't like the vibe n didn't wanna stay longer than necessary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-luis-obispo
Tess S.,"Paso Robles, CA",164,503,229,4.0,10/15/2017,"I love CPK. I used to eat there at every location in L.A. they are all the same- consistently good. I haven't eaten this location very often, because sadly, chains aren't very popular in San Luis. There are just too many really good small, non corporate restaurants to visit. That said, I still love to come for the barbeque chopped chicken salad.  It hasn't changed much over the years, the ingredients are the same, but different. So, instead of chopped jicama, for example,  it's now shredded. They also don't have the original chopped salad at all. That was a bit of a drag. Lunch service is o.k., thet only had 2 servers on a Friday, so it took forever to get water, and to pay the bill. All in all, if you are familiar with CPK's menu, and you like full bar, this place won't disappoint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-luis-obispo
Susy G.,"Morro Bay, CA",39,144,635,3.0,10/16/2016,Visited this location for the first time about a week ago.  The place was pretty empty when we arrived mid afternoon but soon it filled up pretty quickly.  I ordered the Thai pizza and my wife the garlic chicken. Both were absolutely delicious!  Also ordered a side salad. We easily split that between both of us.  Watch out for the complimentary bread and seasoned olive oil. It's so darn good you will find yourself getting full on that alone lol it's fresh baked goodness!  Staff was very friendly! Food was delicious! We will definitely be going back soon!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-luis-obispo
Deidra L.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",2,11,12,2.0,12/12/2017,"Not my first visit here and normally it's super great and fresh and tonight it seems everyone is in a hurry to close up so the bread was mediocre and my Multi cultural egg rolls were barely warm with cold sauces  ... Cup of tomatoe Bisque was pretty good although when they served it was like to some random person sitting next to me, I had a glass of Appthic Red Wine which was by far the most pleasant part of the experience! So sorry CPK you were too busy closing up to pay very close attention to the few of us that graced your 8pm",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-luis-obispo
Brisa T.,"Santa Maria, CA",67,152,70,4.0,12/26/2016,"Stopped in while leisurely shopping in SLO. The place was packed.  We had a seat with less than five minutes wait. I ordered the lime and strawberry cooler, husband had a soft drink and Little Miss had a milk.  Baked bread and oil for dip had been offered while we waited for the order (the mushroom pizza for me, pepperoni for husband and fried chicken with broccoli for the little) and we accepted. Unfortunately our food arrived before the bread did but to his credit our food server brought it out anyway. I much enjoyed the variety of mushrooms on my food as well as the blended cheeses.  Our meal in total time took less than an hour which isn't bad at all for the amount of people being serviced. The only down side was we sat by the entrance near the bathroom and it was very drafty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-luis-obispo
Martin T.,"Baywood-Los Osos, CA",30,127,133,4.0,12/16/2016,"There aren't too many corporate national chain restaurants in SLO, thankfully.  The immense variety and diversity of really good eating establishments in SLO are a true benefit of living in this town. The fact that a corporate giant such as California Pizza Kitchen has a restaurant in this town is testament that the place is worthy. So we have now enjoyed three dinners here we haven't been disappointed. The sangria samplers are a favorite to get things flowing. Interesting menu offerings tempted our palette on each occasion kung pao spaghetti, shrimp scampi zucchini, and my favorite Jambalaya Fettuccini. I also prefer a thin crust pizza which can be ordered as an alternative to their original hand tossed crust. Dessert of course to end on a sweet note...the winner is the butter cake a la mode. The service has been great! Our special requests have always been granted.  In fact we've been so pleased that we are now members of the CPK frequent diner club. I will add for management that the paper napkin be replaced by cloth. I know the pro's and con's of each but the overall dining experience would be improved.

Jim S.,"Arroyo Grande, CA",146,76,48,5.0,11/25/2016,"Always pleased with the service at this CPK. I've been twice this week, lunch and dinner. Dinner was on Black Friday and even with the crush of holiday shoppers, the crew was upbeat and on task. It's not fun working when everyone else is off, and these folks made it a good experience.  My favorite in the Moroccan Chicken Salad. Chunks of tender beets, butternut squash and grilled chicken make this one a treat. We also had the Thai Chicken Salad (with extra peanut sauce gladly delivered), and a BBQ Chicken pizza with Gluten Free crust. CPK has a special GF menu and they also highlight GF suggested items on their main menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-luis-obispo

Ashley C.,"Sacramento, CA",393,783,4209,2.0,1/11/2017,"Since I had pizza the night before, I didn't want to order pizza again, which was probably my first mistake.. I wasn't super hungry either so I just went with mac and cheese bites and avocado egg rolls. I'm a huge fan of the avocado egg rolls at BJ's so I wasn't sure why I was expecting it to be like that. They came with two dipping sauces here, ranch and chipotle, but everything about it was just bland. Same goes for the mac and cheese bites... the plate has four bites in a similar chipotle sauce, yet it still tasted dry and bland. The server seemed like being there was the last place she wanted to be....I don't blame her but you're not supposed to show it to your customers.  Only highlight of that meal was the strawberry mango cooler I got. It was sweet from the strawberries but tangy from the ginger soda...super good! Too bad the waitress never refilled mine.

Then received my order with no bag, so I asked if I could get one and was met with a sarcastic ""it's a big bag,"" and not even an offer of placing my food inside the bag. Did it myself...

Patty R.,"Los Osos, CA",125,101,17,5.0,12/15/2016,"I have to say as a native Californian, I am surprised it took me this long to finally check out CPK. I guess I thought it was JUST pizza, but surprisingly there is more. I LOVE the sangrias! They have a three sangria sampler flight. All are delicious. They have had a Blood Orange one that is not usually in the slight, but I have added it in on occasion. They are not a typical sangria and they are well made by the bartenders!!  So far everything we have ordered has been very tasty and a winner. The soups are very tasty. The market vegetable soup and smashed pea soup are delicious. I have had the chinese chicken salad, kung pao spaghetti, creamy garlic fettuccini with added mushrooms, wild mushroom pasta dish (forgot name), BBQ chicken pizza and mushroom pizza. I ordered them all the the thin crispy crust. Everything is always on point, hot and tasty. The staff so far have all been friendly and quick. We have gone when it is fairly busy, but have never felt neglected or we waited too long for food. The desserts are also great. The butter cake is good, but I think my favorite is the salted caramel pudding. YUMMO! If you have not tried CPK and think it is JUST pizza...try it! You may be surprised!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-luis-obispo
Cynthia S.,"Santa Maria, CA",0,20,,3.0,1/3/2016,"Food was decent. Customer service left lots to be desired. Our server Savannah M was not exactly unfriendly but lacked the personality and knowledge of the menu that one would expect. When you request no onions, it should be told to you at that time that your request could not be accommodated, not after you've received your food. In fact, we've ordered it that way every single time previously so not sure if it changed or she just didn't want to be bothered with it. She basically just went through the motions of service for the remainder of our time there. Not the most cheerful disposition. Maybe bad day? Regardless, that's all we really took away from the visit.

And the Marsh street parking structure is right across the street.   Food is pretty good, but they should really change their name to California Pasta and Pizza Kitchen. The Kung Pao Spaghetti is awesome. Lots of other pasta dishes and good variety of Pizza. The new flatbread appetizers are tasty.  The atmosphere is pretty good and kid friendly. Got nice background music going, but it can get loud when it is busy, then the music is really a non factor. Great place to get dinner after or before a movie from the theatre next door. I have been to this location 20+ times, and I think there was only one time where our service was not very good. We will definitely be back.

It did not take long to get a table and order our food.  The service was a bit slacking. Our waitress really did take her sweet time coming around to get our order, bring in our food, and come by to check on us for more water. She could have been a bit more attentive and faster at doing her job, especially since it wasn't a busy restaurant at all. She was nice, but there was room for improvement.  The food was really good! I loved my order and can't wait to go again! Tip: Download the Pizza Dough app and check in! You get a free side dish of your choice when you do!

Gregory M.,"Pismo Beach, CA",6,6,,1.0,1/1/2016,"Caesar salad with salmon consisted of tiny bits of salmon of not more than an ounce. Ok perhaps to ounces. The croutons were cleverly disguised as more salmon bits. But you can't be fooled when you put them into your mouth. You know they're not salmon. But you paid an extra $4.50 for salmon. I guess that was very clever of them. Service slow, ice cubes milky, tap water. There are so few choices of good food in this town.

The place was air conditioned and well lit and clean with easy going music, and even though it was a holiday, we were sat as soon as we walked in. The hostess fetched us waters immediately upon arrival and our waiter Hannah delivered the most attentive and personable service we've ever had at CPK. (or ever had anywhere-- love!) My 4 year olds even hugged her at the end. Refills were prompt, she seemed more than happy to help my vegetarian husband who has a nut, and dairy allergy, and was constantly on the move making sure we were always O.K. I HIGHLY recommend the chipotle pizza and the quinoa salad.

Michael C.,"Santa Monica, CA",54,31,,1.0,11/24/2016,"I came into the California Pizza Kitchen in San Luis Obispo, CA about a month ago. On the same day, I had called ""George"" the General Manager expressing two concerns. The first one being the host telling me the bar was closed when in fact it was not, and there were people sitting there ordering/eating food. The second concern was that I ordered a Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza (minus some ingredients, thus having just a chicken pizza), and the server, Crystal, made an arbitrary change to the order, thinking she would save me $1 off the cost of the type of pizza. As I expressed to George, Crystal's heart might have been in the right place, however she was not thinking clearly that I ordered a specific pizza for a reason, and that if the $1 savings was of significant value to me, I would have found another restaurant down the street and gotten a slice of pizza for ~$3. Again, if I had more time that day, I would have sent the pizza back to the kitchen for remake, but I did not, therefore over half the pizza was wasted. At the conclusion of this telephonic conversation with George, he advised me that he would send me some gift cards to make up for the poor service his staff exhibited to me. These gift cards were never received. On or about November 12, 2016, I had a second telephonic conversation with George stating that I never received the first set of gift cards allegedly sent out on October 29, 2016. While he did recall the circumstances around the matter at hand, he did confirm that the first set of gift cards had not come back to him undeliverable via U.S. Mail, and he further stated he would send out a second set of gift cards via FedEx to ensure I would be getting them. These gift cards were never received. In short, two phone calls later after the incident, I've come to the conclusion that he is telling me what I may want to hear, but the follow up has failed. I find it really hard to believe that he has sent two sets of gift cards and they ""have been lost in the mail."" I've written a letter to George and the corporate office to documented some potential unethical behavior from the management of this restaurant. It's sad that a patron of over 20 years has to endure, let alone document this poor experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-luis-obispo?start=20

During today's visit we were served by Lynn. Immediately we were greeted by an authentic smile and warm & kind demeanor from her. She was incredibly informed on the menu, including any and all food & drink specials and had no hesitation answering any questions we may have had. She gave us a comfortable amount of time to decide on our meals, and did not rush our decision-making nor did she disappear once we were ready to order. While the meals were being prepared, I reveled in delight at the creative display my Sangria Flight demonstrated; a careful concoction crafted by the bartender. My husband chose the Moscow Mule and he said it tasted delightful. The restaurant was very clean, as were the bathrooms (which is of great importance to me!) We did not have to wait long for our food, and once it arrived it was exquisite in every way I remembered. I ordered my personal favorite; the Pear & Gorgonzola Pizza. My husband ordered one of the new lunch specials they offer-the BBQ Chicken Pizza & side salad.  All in all the service was excellent, the food was amazing & the atmosphere was clean & inviting.

Adriana G.,"Arroyo Grande, CA",49,102,381,4.0,12/13/2015,This is a great place to grab dinner while shopping. It's across from the parking garage. Very close to a lot of shops. We came in for a quiet dinner. The service was OK. We ordered one of their new specials which was a chicken garlic lime dish or something like that. We also grabbed a Jamaican thing crust pizza. FYI the spices in the Jamaican pizza have some heat to it so that was a little disappointing for we had a hard time having more than one slice. So if you like some heat you'll definitely love this. I recommend you to order the the roles that they have for an appetizer mainly the Baja style ones are absolutely delicious cannot get enough of those.

Christine G.,"San Diego, CA",0,41,8,3.0,3/29/2015,"Update to our review below: 04/09/2015 We received a call from the manager, Jordan, after posting this review. He handled our concerns seriously and professionally. He was disappointed in the service and assured us that he would address the issues that we experienced. He clearly feels that customer service should be a priority at his restaurant. I definitely felt much better following his call and increased our original star rating from a one star to a three star rating specifically because of my conversation with Jordan.  Initial review: We stopped here on a road trip for dinner.  We have eaten at CPK restaurants before and expected a similar experience.  Oh boy did this restaurant NOT meet our expectations. Once we sat down, our waitress was unfriendly from the start. After our family ordered, I decided to add a salad to our meal. She had just walked away and began to input our order into the system when I went over and asked to add a salad to the order. She looked annoyed and bothered. Once our food was delivered (not by the waitress, but by another staff member), she NEVER checked on us. She stood by the bar and loudly talked about some penicillin reaction (in great detail) she'd had recently with other wait staff while we were eating. This was not really what we wanted to hear during our meal. I'm sure the other customers within earshot felt the same. In fact, there were so many servers standing around talking with each other and not serving customers that we were pretty surprised by the whole atmosphere in the restaurant.  The waitress did show up at the end of our meal to hand us our check. We were paying for part of the meal with a gift card. My husband had the gift card on an app on his phone. Therefore, he had to hand the waitress his phone to scan the gift card. She made a comment to another server (loudly enough for us to hear it) that she didn't like when customers used apps for gift cards because then she had to take their phones. When we were walking out, the host asked us how our visit was. We shared that we felt like the customer service from the waitress was less than satisfactory. Instead of trying to rectify the situation with a manager, he just said that he'd let the waitress know that we weren't happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-luis-obispo?start=20

There are a few negatives: 1. The wine by the glass list was pretty hurting. Not enough choices, and no interesting choices at all;  2. Servers kind of tag-teamed us (which is OK), but also pretty much ignored us and forgot to bring us some of what we ordered or asked for (which is not so OK).

Laura D.,"San Francisco, CA",88,265,,3.0,11/10/2008,"In the past ten years, I think San Luis Obispo has been trying to evolve into a little Santa Barbara. It seems this transformation wasn't complete until they put the CPK in downtown where the old Fresh Choice used to be.  I've been to this CPK a few times and I must say, it is an efficient restaurant. On a Saturday night, four of us only waited 15 minutes- the perfect amount of time to go into Barnes and Noble and pick up that new book I wanted. The hostess, bless her heart, as she is constantly being bombarded, is always welcoming.  Our sever was very friendly, and when we asked about the new cream-less asparagus soup, he gave us his honest opinion on it. Then he brought us a free taste of it- love it! The soup was light, needed more seasoning, but the croutons were delicious. A healthy option, for sure. I highly recommend the Thai Crunch Salad- it has a sweet peanut dressing, atop lettuce, onions, wontons, chicken, peanuts, and cilantro. Also, the Thai Linguine is delicious- pasta in a peanut sauce with veggies. And of course, my favorite thing on the menu that is always good- their Tomato Tortilla Soup. SO GOOD.  One note though- I think you have to ask for bread now. I'm totally fine with it, that way, people don't over eat and/or food doesn't get wasted. Another note, our waiter did not write down our order- he did it in his head and made a few mistakes. Writing down an order is perfectly fine and I think is a positive thing- one that shouldn't be avoided.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-luis-obispo?start=100

Big day in the city for a small town girl. It was a day of amazing customer service and pampering but the unexpected topper came when i stopped into CPK for a very late lunch.  The nice guy who seated me (tall, curly blond hair, forget name) inquired if i needed anything and i asked of there was a newspaper anyplace. He said there was usually one someone had brought in and trotted off to look.  He turned the place upside down looking but, not today. I went & got myself a New Times and when i walked back in he noticed and said he was glad i found something.  Next up was Lynn and her name tag said she was from Hollywood. We had a spring board right there and compared places we'd grown up. She was a natural and i liked her right away. Time to order and should i have the bacon on the b-b-q chicken pizza? She described the bacon in terms of being flavorful, non-fatty and complimentary to the chicken. O.k., we'll go with Lynn's recommendation and a half ceaser.  Food was as described, tasty and prompt with my salad arriving first and not rushed by the pizza while the kind busser continued to fill my water glass. The kicker: I asked Lynn where a pay phone might be in the complex as i had to call my mechanic at a particular time. She said, ""No, you use my phone."" and was back in a flash with it, dialed the number for me & left me to make the call. The shop needed to call me back and she told me to keep her phone. Wow. It took a little longer on the mechanic's end and Lynn was leaving her shift and arranged for me to use the house phone for the call. Someone give this woman a raise and let her conduct guest service workshops. Everyone else was so accommodating after Lynn left. They saw i had left my table (thought i was wearing out my welcome) and said i could sit there as long as i wanted until the ride from the shop came.  I only wish i knew more names and i'm sorry i don't. Among the other great people was a fellow named Kevin & a friendly girl with a long blond ponytail. Hate leaving anyone else out but i wanted to cite who i remembered.

Phyllis S.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",29,11,,2.0,1/31/2015,"Normally I would give CPK three stars but last night the service and food were lacking. We ordered two salads and a pizza to split. The pizza arrived after quite a long wait and it was barely warm and the toppings were skimpy on half of it. The server said she had told the kitchen to hold the pizza behind the salads. The salads arrived and I asked for the pizza to be heated more. They took it away and brought it back after awhile and it was still barely warm, the cheese was even set and gummy. I asked twice for parmesan cheese and almost gave up on that arriving but it finally did. It wasn't terribly busy there, I have eaten there when the line was out the door and the food was great. Not sure what the problem was but I heard servers apologizing to other customers about the arrival times on their order. It will take awhile before I return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-luis-obispo?start=80
Ivan D.,"Concord, CA",28,295,665,3.0,2/12/2009,"For a Wed night, it was pretty busy.  I had the new chicken pesto chicken thin crust pizza.  Pretty tasty.   Love the thin crust.  Almost ate the whole pizza :)   I had a house salad, ate half of it.  Not that impressed with their ranch sauce, not that much flavor.  Had to ask for some extra on the side since it hardly had dressing to start.  I'll give it a three star rating since nothing wow'd me, but didnt really have a bad experience.    Great location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-luis-obispo?start=80
Stephen P.,"Arroyo Grande, CA",376,51,,5.0,5/20/2012,"This is one of my favorite restaurants, and my wife concurs. The name is somewhat misleading, because it doesn't serve just pizza. If a pizza parlor and a bistro had a baby, you might wind up with something like this. The pizza IS very good. Most recently, I ordered a thin-crust chicken/pesto selection that was great. The salads are awesome, as well, and there's a selection of tasty soups, too. The menu also includes sandwiches, pasta and a few other items. The prices are reasonable - generally between $12 and $17 for a plate - and the service is pleasant, though it was a bit slow on our most recent visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-luis-obispo?start=80
C K.,"Pismo Beach, CA",23,224,77,3.0,2/25/2011,"Blehhhhhh always forced to go back because my friends have no taste buds. Ok pizza, ok soups, ok salads, decent appetizers, good sangria and yummy tiramisu cake. And now that restaurants have all their calories posted for the world to see, you realize how much harm you are doing to your body by eating CPK. Their asparagus soup is probably the safest thing.

A W.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,19,,2.0,5/21/2012,"Used to be an ok restaurant, then hadn't been there in a long time and it's just become a total dive bomb. I ordered a pizza and it was just covered and dripping with oil. I felt like I was breaking out everywhere due to so much oil everywhere. It was more do you want pizza with that oil? We asked for the bread because apparently they said it's too expensive for them to give it to you unless you ask. The bread was very hard and I actually hurt my jaw from trying to chew on it. We waited about 10 minutes before someone came to get our drinks and we did not receive any refills the entire time until after we paid the waiter asked if we wanted refills. Overall I will never be going to a CPK ever again. Horrible gross food and WAY over priced. From the last time I went till now everything went up $5+ and it is definitely not worth the extra cost.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-luis-obispo?start=80
Alana A.,"Boston, MA",57,282,10,3.0,1/18/2010,"Birthday dinner for a friend with about 15 people.  We made a reservation but still needed to wait about 45 minutes to get seated.  I was pretty hungry by the time we got here and so I ordered the Chicken Lettuce Wraps to start and shared a Jamaican Jerk pizza with my friend.  I really enjoyed the lettuce wraps although they only gave three pieces of lettuce which was not going to be enough given the large portion of chicken.  The sauce that was on the side had a kick to it but was tangy and sweet.  The Jamaican Jerk Chicken had such an awesome flavor that I was honestly not expecting from CPK, my friend talked me into us ordering it and I am so glad she did.  It was not as spicy as traditional jerk chicken (my mom is from the West Indies), but the peppers were sweet and the chicken had large flavorful chunks.    Bless our waitresses heart, she was so friendly and brought refills on drinks before we even asked for them and didn't seem overwhelmed by our big group.   I think that CPK is a little too expensive for the portions that you get and I think that there are a lot better restaurants in San Luis.  But it wasn't my birthday so I just went a long with what was already chosen.  Good time but I'll try to avoid chain restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-luis-obispo?start=80
jeannie p.,"Arroyo Grande, CA",2,1,,1.0,12/19/2011,"Just had lunch at California Pizza Kitchen.  We ordered a house salad and a pizzas.  The salad came and there was a little surprise in if.  To my horror! A black pubic hair was in it.  No joke.  The manager can over and apologized.  He offered us another salad.  No thank you!!!  I don't think I will be eating out any time soon, thanks to the chefs at CPK. The star I gave was for the pizza.

Mike B.,"Pismo Beach, CA",0,4,,4.0,8/1/2013,"Really relaxed dine in experience. Served was helpful a d had no problems taking g time to help with wine and menu suggestions.  Food was delicious. The asparagus and arugula salad was light, refreshing and also almost to small. I could have s Kept eating more of it but it was probably better that it was only and appetizer. BBQ chicken pizza was a fairly basic BBQ chicken nothing hugely out of the ordinary on it. The chicken though was very tender and succulent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-luis-obispo?start=80
robin w.,"San Francisco, CA",189,156,9,3.0,8/11/2010,"I've only been to a CPK once and I was amazed when I stepped in. I didn't imagine it to have a classy-esque ambiance to it. The place is dimly lit and there's modern furniture all around. Quite a nice set up.  Staff is pretty nice. They refill your drinks if you need to and they're bothersome or anything.  The food is pretty interesting. I wanted to try a pizza I've never heard of before and I think I happened to order the Mexican/taco pizza. When I got it my co-worker said it looked like cat food. I laughed and dug into my first slice. It was warm and was very soft. Almost no crunch from the dough at all. I personally like a little bit of starchiness in my pizza, but this was fine. The bits of beans and corn were kind of weird. Not really my cup of tea, but everything else was good. Not great, but good.  The appetizers were pretty delicious though. We had some wraps/rolls with some salsa. It was hot and crunchy. It was also filled with lettuce and meat. Reminded me of an egg roll, but American style.  This place is pretty good but in my opinion it's too much for what you get. Kinda of pricey and there's other pizza places to go to that are better. My meal wasn't that memorable but I didn't leave unhappy.  If you want to bring some friends along for a pizza night but not really feeling the Fatte's or Domino's, this is one place to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-luis-obispo?start=80
Dustin N.,"Roseville, CA",9,12,,4.0,8/3/2014,Came for dinner on a Saturday night. Very friendly service. We were happy that there was no wait to get seated. Most places in SLO have long wait times on Saturday night. Food was good.
