c L.,"San Francisco, CA",6,151,25,3.0,12/3/2017,It's been awhile since we've come here and it seems like the quality has gone way down. Ordered the bbq chicken salad and it was terrible. It tasted like one of those Safeway or Trader Joe's boxed salads. The lettuce was soggy and the chicken was cold and hard. Almost seemed like the salad was premade.  My son got the fusilli with meat sauce and the noodles were not cooked. Sauce was like ragu. Gross We ordered a pizza too and it was the best part of the meal so stick with the pizza if you come here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo
S S.,"Redwood City, CA",3,37,,1.0,12/1/2017,"They used to be good.  I keep trying in the hopes that they'll come around.  But I think they're too far gone. This is for a DoorDash delivery, but my observations of the decline are based on many in-store and delivery experiences over many years. Banh Mi Bowl was so spicy as to be inedible.  The chicken crisp things were like burned KFC crumbs that couldn't possibly have been 6 oz. before and certainly not after getting incinerated.  The Cobb salad was 2/3 the amount of what I get when I order in the store (if that), and the accompanying chicken was old and gross - to cap it off, I got about 1 tsp of salad dressing, and they forgot the beets. In retrospect, I would have paid someone $100 to NOT have to serve this food to my family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo

Alyssa C.,"Daly City, CA",283,224,186,1.0,3/31/2017,"I used to like coming to this place but after yesterdays experience Im not sure if I would come back... my bf & I went in for lunch and ordered 1 mushroom, sausage, & pepperoni pizza and the their avocado club egg rolls to share.  First of all, their service is whack. Once we were seated our server just threw our menus on the table.. no greeting no nothing! After we orderd we sat and waited for about 10 mins and our appetizer gets to the table. It tasted like it was just microwaved and did not taste fresh at all! It wasnt even hot. Then right after someone else comes and brings our pizza to the table and asks if we would like any cheese. We ask for cheese and peppers and the guy forgot to get it.. so we had to ask another person, he seriously took FOREVER to come back! Finally he comes back and our pizza is already down to a couple slices and asks us if we still want cheese.... and guess what? Still no peppers. The food here isnt that good anymore. And the fact that their service is like this makes it worse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo
Jennifer N.,"Walnut Creek, CA",442,1070,2984,3.0,12/12/2016,"I'm a CPK fan-there I said it! I have the Pizza Dough rewards app on my phone and, yes, I'm even on their email list. There are a few go-to menu items I rotate through and I like the general consistency and quality in most CPK locations. Located in the Hillsdale mall, where the food court is currently under renovation, this CPK tends to get very busy. Add in the holiday shoppers and well, you can only imagine the wait times (both for seating and food.)  The food was perfectly fine (I got the California veggie on thin crust-their thin crust is always on point for me) and they kept the free bread coming. Our server was amazing-she kept checking on us and letting us know of delays in our food coming out. Drinks were refilled promptly and she kept her cool on what appeared to be an extremely busy Saturday. At 3:30-ish, the restaurant was nearly full but she did an amazing job of being sure we were taken care of. There were a few improvements to the overall experience that made this a 3 star rating instead of 4. First of all the ""waiting area"" is pretty much non-existent. The hostess stand is outside the front door in the mall itself. If you're put on the list to wait, there are only a few places to sit-otherwise patrons jam up in the doorway or awkwardly stand in the mall. Second, they have a few booths very close to the kitchen and the passageway to and from. We had the misfortune of being seated there. Not only did we see the messy kitchen floor, but we also had servers bustling past us or congregating waiting for their orders to be up. We just felt like we had too much activity in our seating area and it was a bit unpleasant. Sure they'd lose some seats if they took those booths out but it's not a big loss considering how chaotic our dining experience was. Other than that it's what you'd expect from CPK. I love it, don't hate :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo
Kelly D.,"San Francisco, CA",0,3,,4.0,9/30/2017,"Before CPK's renovations, I didn't love the restaurant honestly. I thought the food/service was okay, but not a place I'd think of going to all the time. But now, my mind has changed! It took a little bit longer to get seated than what the host told us. She had to come up to get our phone number twice and then we got the text that our table was ready like ten minutes late the second time around. So overall, it was a 35 minute wait that was supposed to be 20 like she said. Not a huge deal since they hadn't used iPads before so I'm sure some mistakes will be made.  Everything else was pretty much uphill from there! Service was kind and quick. Only thing was when we asked for bread, we were only given four pieces for a family of four lol. One each didn't really suffice haha. The spicy buffalo cauliflower (which is new to the menu) is AMAZING. Perfect appetizer. I ordered the limited time only, shrimp scampi pizza, and I hope they bring it back/make it permanent some day, it was delicious. And the new cucumber reviver was very cooling and refreshing! The presentation of everything is definitely a lot better than before as well. I'm glad they took the time to improve because I'll definitely be coming back more often!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo
Jackie F.,"San Bruno, CA",41,26,8,3.0,10/17/2017,"This review is for the curbside pickup.  I called the number, it was an automated machine, so I made the selection to order to-go. A really nice lady helped me over the phone but when I asked her where the curbside pick up area was she didn't know because it's like a call center so she's not working at the location I called. Anyways, I found it and called once I got there to have them bring out the order. I took away stars because once I got home I noticed something had leaked on my seat. Once opening the bag I noticed it was the oil they give you for bread. I have never been given oil for my bread, only butter, and even then they put it inside the bag w/the bread. If they would've done that it wouldn't have leaked on my seat. So now I have an oil stain which I'll have to get professionally cleaned off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo

Jojo B.,"San Carlos, CA",0,3,,5.0,12/27/2017,This place underwent a renovation a couple months ago and haven't been back until today. It looks magnificent.

Siu W.,"Millbrae, CA",0,20,76,4.0,4/12/2017,"This place never disappointed me since the first time I've been there. Love love love their food, and they always give me excellect service with one or two exception, but this review is based on my visit today. I asked the server to give me pepper (I actually meant black pepper) but she gave me red pepper flakes but it was fine because it made the pizza even better.  Pros: Excellent customer service, the girl that served me and my mom was super nice and helpful. And she was attentive.  Food tasted the same Presentation actually got better than the times I've been there.  Portions are consistent  Cons: The Moroccan salad was underdressed and had so little butter nut squash and lack of avocado, and had less dates than the times I had it(I eat this every time I go there so believe me I know it tasted different. Thus, the salad was not mixed well which caused a bite can be all nuts.  Found a eyebrow on the avocado, not sure was mine or the cook's, so I can't make this reason to give them a 4 stars.  What threw me off was the restroom. Me and my mom decided to use it before we leave because it is usually cleaner than the restroom at the mall, but not this time. When I opened the door, I had to close it immediately because it smelled so HORRIBLE! It smelled worse than a dumbster I'm telling you...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo

Amy K.,"Foster City, CA",19,126,24,2.0,11/23/2016,"Such a disappointing experience.  Our hostess was kind a friendly.  But when our waiter arrived, he was haughty and seemed like he was in a hurry. Took 3 tries for him to take our order and I wondered, when he left if he'd even get it right. It did come out right, but... When our food came, my son complained that it wasn't hot, it was just warm. My daughter's fusilli with butter was fine.  I ordered the artichoke-spinach thin crust pizza. It's usually my favorite. But it lacked flavor and the crust was soggy, like it was undercooked. How can you undercook a thin-crust pizza?!?!  Thin crust pizza is supposed to be crunchy like a cracker.  Our waiter did check on us once during our meal and promptly brought my iced tea refill. And when he returned to see if we were finished, he was much friendlier...was it because he realized it was about to be tip time or because he was in a better mood?   Overall...eh...not planning a return visit anytime in the near future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo

I was on a crunch for time so I decided to do a pick up order and it was greatly disappointing. The chinese chicken salad is supposed to come with cabbage but they gave me wilted lettuce and the chicken was rubbery - as if it wasn't cooked all the way. I was looking forward to eating this salad after a great first experience but now I would probably never get it again...I guess unless it is in dining.

We both ordered the same thing. Garlic chicken fettuccini. The taste was pretty decent. Although the for the price, the portion could be bigger. Compared to Cheesecake Factory close by, for the price you pay at pizza kitchen, you'll get a much bigger portion at cheesecake and enjoy your food more.

What keeps people coming back is the decent chain restaurant menu and they do a good job of mixing it up seasonally. My current favorite pizza is the carne asada pizza. The pumpkin cheesecake is really good. What's not so great is that since the food court is gone and there aren't other other dining options, if there's a crowd at the mall, this place is a madhouse. The service is just OK, mostly teenagers who always seem to miss some details.

Kimberly G.,"Visitacion Valley, San Francisco, CA",32,16,38,1.0,2/14/2017,"The reason why I give California pizza A one star is because of their poor service , if I can give this establishment negative one I would . Came in a Tuesday afternoon to have some pizza with my plus one . They sat us down quickly which I liked the restaurant wasn't packed at all the noise was bearable .  Our server was a young man he was so neglectful of my table he didn't serve us complementary bread nor did he come & check on us during our meal.  Every time we needed him we had to flag one of his coworkers down & I don't think that's appropriate. When we would ask him to bring us a refill or just anything it seemed to bother him . It took our server 10 minutes to pick up our tab I've never had to wait  so long at a not so busy establishment . I don't think I will be coming back to this location ever again he destroyed my experience here hope management speaks to their servers on how to treat customers ,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo?start=20

Angelique L.,"Burlingame, CA",206,497,1562,2.0,6/26/2015,"At the mall on a Friday night, the stores are closing and my friend and I find that we're starving. We decide to go to CPK. Turns out EVERYONE had the same idea. CPK is packed with families and there are a dozen more waiting. There are two of us so we could have sat at the bar but it basically looked like sitting in the kitchen, so we waited. And waited. And waited. We finally got probably the worst two-top in the place, right next to the seats we'd rejected. Ha! Next to one of the waiter stations. We cajoled our way into a better seat but were clearly hated for asking. No matter. We were in a nice booth and could rest after a long shopping spree. I ordered a glass of wine and they ask if you want small or large. HUH? Regular glass of wine, which one is regular? 6 oz or 9 oz is the answer. Good lord. My friend ordered a Corona and I kid you not, the waiter brought a 24 oz giant bottle! She said ""oh, I had no idea it was a giant bottle."" We're totally mystified as the waiter knows that it's just the two of us girls. ""I can't drink all this, I wish you would have said something,"" she says. To which the waiter shrugs and says something about thinking we wanted to party. UGH. I've eaten at lots of CPKs and -- for a chain restaurant -- it's quite good. Crispy crust, regular pizzas, the signature dishes, big salads, I love it all. But this particular one needs to be cleaned and/or remodeled. It has that gross dirty carpet smell that puts me right back in college to my days waiting tables. It's the way a lot of places smell before they start cooking the food. But when you're sitting right next to the kitchen in full swing, and it smells like dirty carpet, it makes you wonder just how filthy it is.

I had asked to speak to the manager but was never approached by him, Mark (the usual manager, Kimi Green, was not at the restaurant that day).

C. M.,"Foster City, CA",0,23,,2.0,1/23/2017,"It had been a while since I ate at CPK. I met a friend for lunch on a weekday before noon. It got more and more crowded and was pretty full by 2:00. We placed our orders before 12:00 and at the time the restaurant wasn't all that busy. Service was slow - drinks were slow, food was super slow. The Bianco flatbread had a lot of cheese but not much taste. The Chinese chicken salad had too much dressing and the veggies were limp. The Red Berry Sangria (way overpriced at $10!) was o.k. but not worth the price.It's possible to have lunch for under $40 (the cost of my meal), I don't think I'll be eating at that CPK anymore, there are too many other restaurants that are reasonably priced and have better food in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo?start=40

I went in the afternoon with some of my girlfriends to enjoy some yummy food from here.  The waiter we had was some older guy (in the picture you can see the side of his face).  My friend asked him if the chicken on her salad could be cut into smaller pieces and he said ""I'll see if they have time"". Wait what ? Are we not paying for this food? Shouldn't it be made how we want it? That is a sentence I never want to hear from a waiter, I'm here paying for my food therefore my food  better be made how I want it. If it's extra $$ just tell me but don't tell me your going to see if they have time.  He was a rude waiter overall and did not seem very happy to be our waiter.

Amy G.,"Mountain View, CA",101,751,739,4.0,6/7/2015,"Surprisingly, this place was packed around 1pm on a Sunday afternoon, though we didn't wait at all for a table. I don't remember being enchanted with CPK on my one or two visits to the chain, but I very much enjoyed the food we had this meal: we shared a The Works pizza, which includes sausage, pepperoni, olives, onions, and peppers and a full size roasted veggie salad. They ask if you want complimentary bread, which of course I accepted. The oil and herb mixture they offer for dipping is very savory, fragrant, and tasty. I have actually found myself thinking about it since my meal here and contemplating how to recreate it at home. I liked the saltiness of the meats on the pizza. Most of all, I liked how the pizza wasn't overladen with cheese and the thin, crispiness of the crust. It's fun and all to see strings of cheese dripping of pizza, but to eat it that way actually grosses me out. CPK has a lighter, more appetizing take on pizza. The roasted veggie salad consisted of a spring mix with avocado, asparagus, artichoke, and other yummy greens. I might ask for a bit lighter hand with the balsamic dressing next time, but the salad was overall tasty and with added protein would definitely satisfy as a meal by itself.  The total plus tax and tip was $35 for three of us, which is a reasonable price. This lunch boosted my opinion of CPK! Now, I will think of it as a good place for an affordable sit-down meal with high quality food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo?start=40

We complained about small protein portions in both a taco and salad dish. You're paying $5 extra for salmon in your salad and you get 3 thumb-sized chunks...  So of course, we bring it up with our waiter. He brings the manager over, and the lady sees AND she herself points out ""oh that's all they put on your taco..?"" And then proceeds to defend why and how the kitchen pre-measures out their protein portions for their dishes. Then asks if we would like more of the salmon and mahi mahi on the dishes.  UMM YA THINK?

I've only ever ordered the pizzas so I can't really review their pastas/salads/whatever else they serve. We usually get a California Club pizza, though we've tried a few other ones like the teriyaki, the mushroom and sausage, and some of the seasonal ones (one had artichoke, egg, and potatoes!). The California Club is by far my favorite -- it feels like a healthier version of pizza. They're generous with the veggies that they top it with.  One pizza's ~$15 and we usually share. Between the pizza and the free bread they serve at the beginning, it's sufficiently filling for dinner.  They can get really, really busy around lunch time. A lot of families will stop in before or after a day of shopping, so it gets especially crowded on the weekends. I'd give them 5/5 but service is really hit or miss, sometimes they're really on top of everything and other times (especially when it's really busy) it can get difficult to flag down someone to refill your water or close your check.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo?start=60

Jessica H.,"San Mateo, CA",0,3,,5.0,6/25/2015,"Yesterday was my first time at California Pizza Kitchen. All I have to say is WOW. Everything was great. I am a picky eater and I have to say that the food was excellent. Not only was the food very good, the customer service provided at CPK was very welcoming and it was very much appreciated.  We went in around 715 and we were told the wait was about 10-15 so of course we decided to wait. My friend wanted to look at the menu so when he asked the hostess, she was rude. She just handed him the menu without even looking at him with a smile or anything. This left a horrible impression and I was already dissatisfied. I used to work in a restaurant so I know how important first impressions are and hers was not great. I would recommend getting rid of her because she gave a bad vibe upon 10 mins being there especially that we were first timers. I will not go on about her because the rest of the staff was truly great. We were seated after 10 mins like we were told. The name of the server we had was Gianna. She was amazing. She was very helpful with her suggestions and she really made us feel welcomed. You could tell that she likes her job and she was not bothered no matter how many questions we asked. I loved her customer service and I hope we get her again. The hostess should take a couple tips from Gianna.  We were told if we sign up for the rewards, we would receive a free small plate. We got the Shaved Mushroom and Spinach flat bread. It was DELICIOUS. The name of the manager that was working was Becky.  She was super nice and friendly. You could tell that she was loved her job as well. She brought us the flat bread which was surprising because managers usually sit there and dont send food. She was very active and we really felt welcomed by her. Its nice to see that even though she is a manager, She still cared to help the servers. We were also served bread and it was soo yummy. The oil with spices was just amazing.  For the Entree we ordered the California Cobb Salad and Half Tostada pizza and half California Club. It was amazing. There are no words to describe how good the pizza was. Throughout our entire dinner, Gianna was checking on us and getting a refill and just all around great.  Towards the end of the meal, We were so full we did not want to get up and walk. Becky the manager came up and checked on us again. It was so sweet that a manager showed how much she cared about our first time here. She offered us a free dessert but we declined since we were so full. It was really sweet of her and we appreciate the amazing customer service. Both Becky and Gianna really made our first time here amazing and totally made us forget about the rude hostess.

Oddly enough, I don't care much for their pizzas but I always find myself coming back for their pasta and appetizers.  Food: - Chicken Tequila Fettuccine: My favorite pasta dish ever!! It's very unique and I've never had a fettuccine that was bursting with so much flavor. It doesn't taste like tequila per se, but there is a nice hint of lime and peppers within the sauce, and it has the perfect amount of creaminess. It comes with ample chicken and bell peppers and usually I can't even finish all of the meat. The noodles are always just the right texture and are never overcooked or under cooked. This is definitely a major plus for me, because a lot of restaurants, especially chain restaurants, do not cook the noodles for just the right amount of time. - Avocado egg rolls: These are crispy, sweet and salty, and who knew avocados would go so well within an egg roll. This is an appetizer that I usually never pass up whenever I come to CPK.  Service: I've never had an issue with the service or the wait. Most I've waited is about 15 minutes, and I've had attentive service each time. The waiters are always around to refill your water or ask if you need anything else, and for a busy restaurant they've always provided great service.

We didn't get any bread. Our food was super salty, like we understood they were closing but they could have definitely gave us better service. Our waiter was super friendly and helpful that's the only good thing. But either than that a male employee was literally passing vacuum while we were eating our dinner rite next to us. We were having a conversation and had to basically YELL over our selfs. Pretty much they were all rude!! Their was two young lady's also behind the cpk counter so very uncomfortable they would look over to our table with a very dirty look they would speak and look away.

All the orders seem to be cracking out of the kitchen, only thing is, there's no heat lamp so if your food is sitting there a while, it will get cold. For us, our food was fast, hot, and delicious. I tried the salad pizza and it was amazing and filled you up. Our server was really good, asked us to join the rewards program and offered all other possible food recommendations. We had iced teas and he was super fast with identifying when our drinks were getting low and asking us for a refill. In/out before 3pm.

I got a standard email saying someone will follow up. And that was that - it's been weeks! I can understand that mistakes are made sometimes. But it is a different story when the restaurant does not care at all about quality or service. Also, in this case, it is really worst - what if I had some food allergies?!

I called the Hillsdale store and explained my dilemma to the manager Fausto and asked him if he would be willing to exchange the offending pies for the desired ones. Even though it was not his store that caused the problem and he had no obligation to do so, he graciously agreed to fix the mistake. His actions did more than just save me the gas and time to drive back to Stanford (probably 45 min round trip) with cranky hungry kids in tow, they demonstrated in a tangible way that CPK really cares about customer service and satisfaction.

My biggest complaint is that the last few times I've visited over the past year, the place smells more and more like a cafeteria. Honestly rank odor. I can't imagine the managers haven't noticed it, which means that corporate is being stingy with money for basic maintenance. Not sure if the Hillsdale remodel scared away all their great help, but there weren't many people working tables, the manager was great and kept things going, but he seemed a bit panicked. Maybe a few staff didn't show. Whatever, I got the feeling this last time that they were understaffed. Still, the food was excellent and came out promptly. The waiter was good, but overwhelmed so I had to flag him down to get anything. Luckily, I'm assertive when late, so I got out of there in a reasonable amount of time. That being said, the restaurant was probably no more than half full. Probably due to the remodel at Hillsdale, but still. I got the feeling that corporate had abandoned this property. I mean, a tear in the seats of the booth patched with electrical tape? Come on. How much does that cost to fix? Wondering if they are waiting for a remodel, because the place has gotten very shabby. I hope they are planning on investing in this property or perhaps CPK is going by the way of Pasta Pomodoro. Same problems are arising at CPK as happened with PP it its last years.

Forget for a moment that you are at the edge of a busy shopping mall, children with limited manners, parents constantly checking their iDevices and the busyness with which the staff runs around delivering drinks and food around the place. sitting at the horseshoe bar focuses your attention on the oven and guys making the pizza - a great source of inspiration if you aren't sure what to order. Or... you could go on a random weeknight when it is much more quiet, sedate and decibels of an enjoyable level. Sit at the horseshoe bar and focus on the nice brick oven. This was a weeknight date spot for me and the girl for quite a while. 2 glasses of wine and soup or salad to start, then we could relax and decide what to get on on the main course, pizza. No hurry, no whining kids, no rushing servers waiting on multiple tables with multiple requests. Just calm, yummy scents and the heat from the brick oven. The BBQ chicken is the old standby, but they have lots of other standards (pepperoni and cheese) and more exotic mix and  match pizzas with seasonal greens, veggies and so on. If you do go on the weekend, specifically let the host(ess) know that you prefer bar seating - no kids allowed at the bar and you get in and seated quicker.

Definitely recommend the Poblano Flat breads. Cedar plank salmon is a good choice too, but a little overpriced at $19 But a good choice.   The Italian chopped salad is one of of our favorites.  Good portion size on the full. Enough for 3. The kids pizza combos a re a great deal if you have kids under 11. #3 Place is comfortable when not full.  Too bad it is not on the second level with an type of view.  Too bad they usually close the back session and patio weekdays in the afternoon.

Definitely recommend the habinero carnitas pizza - think carnitas, cilantro pesto, cheese and the SPICIEST SALSA EVER. It packs and punch! ($14.11 with tax, which is kind of pricey I mean you can buy pizza hut and feel just as deliciously good for less in my opinion. ) My experience was positive, but my friend who ordered take out too was missing bread, utensils, salad dressing. So that was unfortunate, hopefully this isn't the typical case and a fluke caused by a flustered server.  The verdict: Takeout is super easy at this location, in and out and you can either call in or order online.  CPK is a great pizza choice for when you really don't know what to eat and want something safe and are willing to fork over a little extra for dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo?start=120

Like others, I'm not too sure what the fuss is with the pizza, but I guess it works.  The service was ok. I think three different people helped us.

We plopped our tired (from shopping) behinds on the leather couch inside the reastaurant, and 15 minutes later we were seated. We shared an order of the sicilian thin crust pizza & a small plate of artichoke hearts. The sicilian pizza was filled w/sausage, ham, salami, onions, and parsley. Out come 7 slices of pipin' warm yummy pizza, perfect to share among 2 ladies. I loved the spicy kick from the sausages. Yum! The breaded artihoke hearts were truly small.. out came about 6 pieces of artichoke hearts powdered w/ parmesan cheese and served with a side of blue cheese dressing. It was good, but very small.

James F.,"Redwood City, CA",10,185,9370,2.0,1/2/2011,"Overall, it is what it is. Chain food that's just so-so. The food we had was salty to the point where it was not edible. I love salty foods, but this really took it to another level. Since it is institutional food (ala McDonald's or Denny's or another corporate chain restaurant), the food is usually pre packaged sent from the factory. All I can say is the salt factor needs to be brought down to a massive level. One of the problems many restaurants face is the difference between flavor and salt. If there are lots of flavors already, salt use can be at most, minimal. When u try to jack up the flavor with salt, then all u get is extreme salty food and a most unpleasant experience. I doubt my family and I will be going back anytime soon. It has the potential to be better should they pay attention to flavor, and not salt, but it's simply not there yet.

I was pretty blown away by the service here though. I came on the day after Christmas so it was pretty packed as well. The hostess at the front was really nice and was always smiling even though there were so many people waiting outside asking her how much longer they needed to wait. Our server was a nice lady who gave us refills multiple times. There was this gentleman - and he wasn't even our server that looked busy going in and coming out of the kitchen waiting tables - he was very nice and asked us if we wanted more bread every time he passed by. He also proactively told us that he was willing to get us more lettuce (for the lettuce wrap appetizers) if we needed more.

Judd H.,"South San Francisco, CA",29,38,,4.0,5/27/2010,"There is a considerable market for sit down pizzerias. You have establishments like California Pizza Kitchen, Amici's East Coast Pizzeria, and Red Brick Pizza. However, California Pizza Kitchen separates its self from these other restaurants by providing an amazing collection of tasty and scrumptious non-pizza entrees.  California Pizza Kitchen is located inside the comfortable Hillsdale Shopping Center which provides both pros and cons... Pro: Parking is abundant and only a tiny walks away Con: Just like any mall it is engulfed with Teenyboppers and rambunctious pre-adolescent boys. This kind of kills any romantic overtures (Which should be killed if you are taking your Tenderoni to CPK). Con/Pro: If you go during dinner time there usually is a wait, BUT you are in the mall you can walk around. You can visit great stores like ANA Furniture and Mid-Peninsula Housing Leasing Center! Now let me speak on the food itself. Anybody familiar with sit down pizzerias knows what they are in for, great tasting pizza, with fun size proportions.  California Pizza Kitchen offers a vast array of pizzas from their classic BBQ Chicken Pizza to an interesting Thai Chicken Pizza. When I eat pizza here I usually go with their BBQ Chicken Pizza or Meat Lovers (No Homo), which is amazing but when I pay 12+ dollars for a pizza I expect to be full...however that never happens. This has led me to try their other options, which at one point I thought was blasphemous, oh how I was wrong. 3 words that have changed my Pizzeria experience...Chicken Tequila Fettuccine! Downright amazing, the sauce, the chicken, the lime, the EVERYTHING. Other entrees like the Jambalaya, Kung Pao Spaghetti, and their endless salads are also great meals they offer. California Pizza Kitchen in many ways is your run of the mill sit down pizzeria; great pizza, small proportions, expensive pricing.  Where it separates itself is that little surprise known as the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine. I compare it to going to a XD movie, you pay a little more for your ticket but you wonder why? Then out of nowhere a bowl of Chicken Tequila Fettuccine pops up and you're like ""Ah I guess it is worth it.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo?start=180

The Hillsdale CPK is always crowded on weekend with long waits, and if there are only two of you just go to the bar its the same menu and no waiting 30 minutes.  Sure, you sit side by side instead of across from eachother, but other than that it works and saves lots of time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo?start=180

I have been here quite a few times because of its location--I shop at the hillsdale mall (not anymore since learning I could take a quite trip on Bart to Powell), and usually always end up here. My best friend/brother Kevin and I have our YEARLY dinner here (YOU ASSHOLE), and everytime we order the same thing; appetizer, hawaiian pizza, and a dessert (to appeal the fatties in us). I never leave unhappy, always full and usually with a stomache. Actually--always with a stomache (lactose intolerance doesn't usually fare well when pizza is on the menu). My latest time there I tried a different pizza--one with japanese eggplant, roasted red peppers and goat cheese. Oh JEEZ, this was awesome. I'm surprised I was able to chew because the goodness numbed my mouth so much, I thought my jaw was hanging and swallowing what I could upon orfice entry (wow, that sentence was incredibly sexual...no dirty thoughts!). Top it off with a beer and I'm pretty much set. Then I go home and writhe around in pain, clutching my stomach and asking myself ""Well, was it worth it?"" For that pizza? Yes. For everything else?

Kim S.,"Redwood City, CA",83,189,1,4.0,4/19/2013,"Is this the best pizza on Earth? No. But it's consistent. It has some pretty decent pizza for our money. I've gone to CPKs for far longer than I want to admit but this one in the mall we've been going to for about 10 years. It can feed my hubs and I, my vegetarian Mom and my picky eater son.     Tonight, though, I have to give them major shout out. We had dinner there. It was around 7pm and the place was jumping. A lot of families, a lot of people, a lot of noise. We kind of had to shout out our order to our waiter. He brought us our drinks, apologized because he had ice in my Mom's drink (we had ordered it without) so he took it back and got her a drink without ice. Our hummus arrived, tasty, the wheat pitas were hot to slather on the hummus.     Then our mains arrived. My hubs had the half Caesar salad with chicken and I had the roasted veggie salad half. Both are enormous, enough to feed two people rather easily. Our son had the mac and cheese which he loves. After a couple of minutes the California club pizza arrived ... except my Mom had ordered the California veggie pizza (which used to be the eggplant pizza). The waiter apologized profusely and took it back. He told us it would take about ten minutes to make the new pizza. After about a minute, another wait staff came by and asked if we wanted the pizza on honey whole wheat which we said yes.     My Mom and I ate my roasted veggie salad (which was super tasty) and about five minutes into our wait, the manager walked over to apologize profusely about the mix up. We told him it wasn't a problem and that we were fine. A couple of minutes later, the waiter returned to apologize again and tell us the pizza would be done within a few minutes. Sure enough, about five minutes later the pizza arrived.     The manager returned again to let us know that our pizza would be comp'ed for the mix up and made sure our bill reflected it. He apologized again to us and yet again as we left.     I have to admit, this was really refreshing. Independent restaurants have a hard enough time admitting messing up but to have a chain restaurant manager do it was just shocking.

Our last experience is why I'm writing the review- I wish I could remember our servers name because I would list it here to avoid due to his poor service. He was very short with us and acted like he wanted to rush us. He took our order and we didn't see him for a while but we noticed other tables getting bread and a dip. We asked another server if that was complimentary and he said yes, and offered to bring us some. Why didn't our server offer? No idea- I guess he didn't want the extra work. The wait was a little long and with three hungry people, we asked him for more bread. (and assumed he would see that we had finished the dip as well and would bring more of that as well but no, he takes the plate and dip dish, but just brings back 3 pieces of bread and did not refill the dip... what a joke. got the food and it was great- but had to keep flagging him down for soda refills rather than him coming to check in on us like normal service. They also had a promotion going on where you get a coupon to bring back that the manager has to open to see what kind of discount or winnings you get. Didn't get that either, had to ask another server again. As I'm writing this I'm kicking myself for leaving him a tip- less than what I normally give but he really didn't deserve one.

The only problem was the thickness of the top layer which abundant in mascarpone (6-8mm ... 2mm are more than enough) but lacked a good dose of powdered cocoa (cocoa was barely sprinkled). The tiramisù was good but it was rather heavy. A portion easily feeds two people.

We ordered a large salad to split and a pizza to share as well.  The menu describes the salad and says served with vinegrette or blue cheese. I told the waiter that we wanted it with the blue cheese dressing, and then repeated myself to make sure he was listening. I also asked for no celery- ick. He brought out the salad and put it between us- no plates. We asked for some plates and he pointed to the itty bitty bread plates. We asked for something bigger.  By the time Joseph finally wandered back with the plates we had a chance to look at the salad and realize it was drenched with vinagrette. We politely showed him so he took it away to fix. Pizza was brought out a minute later. Usually we take our salad before the main course.. but whatever, we'll survive. Salad was brought out with blue cheese dressing, and celery. By this time I was so frustrated with the non-shalant (no idea how to spell that)  waiter that I didn't even want to bother giving the salad another chance so I picked out all the celery pieces witghout saying anything. The salad was edible... tasted like the prepackaged refridgerated ones you get at the grocery store. Lots of wilted lettuce. When the salad was dropped off we asked for some cheese and chile flakes for the pizza. We waited to eat our pizza...  waited... and waited... and finally, he never brought it, and we had cold pizza. Finally we waved down a different waiter and he gladly and pleasantly brought some, right away. Sigh of relief. By then, pizza sucked. All the while I could see our server wandering the restaurant at a slow stroll of a pace. He would chat with his friend the bartender and punctually enter his tips into the computer, while neglecting the few tables he had- maybe 3 or 4 tables.  Ahh joseph, where you high maybe?

I like the variety but at least get the basics right. The crust is very dry and the top was sort of greasy. You can do the ringer test or the napkin test to see what I mean.  Napkin test: basically blot the pizza with a napkin (brown napkin works best) and look at the amount of oil soaked into the napkin. Should be sort of sparse, no large blobs. Ringer Test(little more abstract): Roll the pizza, narrow end to wider end, as tight as you can, over a napkin or plate (like you are ringing it out). Whatever falls into the plate you judge. Usually a little grease and bits of crumbs. If nothing falls into the plate you did it wrong or performed the test with a rubber pizza.

Alex C.,"San Mateo, CA",743,161,37,2.0,5/16/2011,"I really don't get what all the fuss is about the pizza here. I came here the other day with a friend because she was really craving pizza and suggested this place. Having heard all these rave reviews in the past concerning the pizza here, and the fact that they have the word ""Pizza"" in their name, I figured ""Why Not?"".  Came in on a Tuesday afternoon and the place was pretty deserted. They were able to seat us right away and a very friendly waiter came to take our orders almost immediately. Neither of us being particular hungry at the time, we opted to share a pizza and ordered the Meat Cravers, consisting of Italian sausage, pepperoni, Canadian bacon, Capicola ham, julienne salami and Mozzarella cheese.  The wait for the food was fairly short and before we knew it, we had a freshly baked pizza served before us. Being efficient, our waiter immediately deduced that we were going to be sharing the pizza and that would we probably need some plates. So before we even needed to ask, he immediately stated that he would also return shortly with some extra places. +1 for the waiter!  Throughout the meal, our waiter made sure to check in with us periodically to see how we were doing and if we needed anything else. While definitely impressed with the service, the food on the other hand left a lot to be desired. Visually, the pizza looked extremely greasy. A hunch further confirmed after taking the first bite. It was like eating grease and not pizza. The problem was only further compounded by the fact that the ""Meat Cravers"" pizza barely had any meat on it at all! Aside from a few large pepperonis, everything else was rather lacking. I honestly think I find more meat on my Costco pizza than this!  At the end of the meal, in order to wash down the less than appetizing pizza, we decided to share a Apple Crisp. This was definitely the better of the two items that we ordered. The baked apples at the bottom of the dessert was served warm. And when combined with the cold vanilla ice cream on top, it was a melt in your mouth slice of heaven.  While I would definitely give this place a thumbs up for the service, I could not in good conscience recommend this place to anyone looking for a good slice of pizza. Before we left however, the waiter did give us a ""mystery"" card (basically a coupon) for our return trip in which we could potentially win $100K. But at least get 10% off our next meal. As a disclaimer, he stated that the card would be null and void if we opened it prior to our next visit. Having no desire to ingest anymore nasty pizza in the near future, I opened mine up. Let's just say I didn't win 100K.......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo?start=160
Sharon M.,"Baltimore, MD",2,11,,2.0,10/2/2012,"We enjoy the food when it's done right- and mostly it really IS done right :) The waitlist system is a mess, and the staff we've encountered handling the waitlist have been beyond disorganized. Example: We've repeatedly had our names skipped, after waiting LONGER than the stated wait time. So finally, I feel compelled to write a review. * Here's an idea: Hand out alerting monitors during long wait times so guests can browse nearby shops, instead of sitting around & hovering within earshot inside the echoing mall atrium. This isn't rocket science, this isn't even a new technology, and it's been used in restaurants for at least a decade by now. * Here's a simpler idea: Have staff neatly cross-out who's been seated and where they've been seated. Why? Because the CPK staff have said to me: ""Oh! Some one took your table."" which is ridiculous, b/c 1) the statement addresses the issue of who I should blame, instead of how the CPK staff plan to fix the mistake. * Here's the simplest idea of all: Have the SAME staff person manning & calling out the waitlist names, in order to minimize confusion.

Jane says... x.,"Sandy, OR",6,38,8,4.0,12/1/2008,"My friend and I were at Hillsdale mall today with a few hours to hang out, have lunch, catch up, and maybe do some shopping. We were both really hungry and ready for lunch. Our food choices included Boudin, the food court, or California Pizza Kitchen. Since Boudin is a complete rip off and I always leave hungry, we decided to take a look at CPK's menu. I normally avoid pizza places because I can't have dairy. I usually avoid chain-like establishments because of the cardboard cutout food choices as well as the overly kid friendly atmosphere. However, upon checking out the menu, I saw that in addition to pizza, pasta, and salads, that they offered my most beloved of food choices - Jambalaya. I consider myself a jambalaya snob. If it's on the menu, I just have to try it. My experiences with different restaurants have revealed that not everyone can make a decent spicy, flavorful jambalaya that satisfies a lunchtime crave. This one did.  The offering at CPK was packed with tender morsels of chicken, sausage, and shrimp nestled between a flat spaghetti-like pasta. The sauce was savory AND spicy, and generously seasoned with onions and garlic. The only warning I give is that the breath suffers as a result, so the next time I'm there, I'll make sure my husband orders the same thing. Our server was very attentive as well as cute, and the restaurant manager even came by to make sure we were doing alright, which we were. The bread and butter were decent, too, as well as plentiful.  I did have a Thai chicken cheeseless pizza there a few years back on my first visit, and it wasn't half bad. I now have a new fave rave and will happily go back when my jambalaya craving beckons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo?start=300

Our server comes over almost immediately and takes our drink order, I also order an appetizer and my son's food and was going to decide what I wanted in the mean time.  FIFTEEN MINUTES later, no drinks, no food, nothing.  Then someone else comes over and asks if we'd like something to drink.  I tell them to go ask our server about it. Next thing I know, as I'm having this conversation my son takes a head dive into the floor.  As any good mother would, I picked him up off the floor and got more tense than I've ever been in my whole life.  I demanded to see a manager.  Wildon came and offered to seat me at another table.  I told him I should be getting a free meal for what we just went through.  He said ""ha, you're not getting a free meal"".  I started to get really angry at that point and said something about suing CPK.  He then told me that he was going to have security remove me from the restaurant.  I told him I was going to call the police if someone laid a finger on me because my son just fell and this is not how you should treat a customer. He didn't care about the situation at all.  He just kept telling me that he had a business to run.  OK, I know that running a CPK is a super important job, and I shouldn't be so focused on the child that I spent 17 hours of labor to give birth to, but my priorities were out of whack when I noticed that my son's face was starting to bruise. Wildon walked away and I asked for them to go get him and bring him back because my son's face was bruising and I wanted him to see it.  I waited another 10 minutes and he never came.   I called the general manager this morning and was told that it's my fault for allowing my son to sit in the booster.  So it's my fault that I was mistreated.  I deserved it.  I called him a piece of shit and wished death upon him and I don't regret it at all. I'm in the process of talking to corporate and we'll see what they have to say.  I don't think I'll be back to a CPK, this location or otherwise.  I don't know that I'll buy their frozen pizzas anymore either.

But the traditional pizzas were really good and it was cheaper too. Sometimes we have to wait for 30 mins or more.

Teresa W.,"Millbrae, CA",85,77,8,4.0,8/26/2007,"This place has realllllllly great pizza!! Really busy all the freaking time.

Jauder H.,"San Francisco, CA",27,84,14,1.0,11/26/2007,"We ended up eating here as I threw hate on having Chinese food yet again and M balked at Japanese.  The meal was okay although M did not like her Tostada pizza. However, the reason they are getting only a single star is that there were flies all around the drinks dispenser. We had sat at the bar since the place was packed but did not notice the flies until halfway through the meal.  Upon speaking to the manager (Wildon), his response was ""We know about it"" with no attempt to address things. I would highly recommend that management address the lack of customer service ASAP.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo?start=320
brenda b.,"San Lorenzo, CA",81,308,9,4.0,4/27/2006,"I am full agreement that the wait time sucks.  But as someone who brings miniature people, ie, kids under the age of 4, California Pizza Kitchen is not such a bad place.  The 3 year old likes to play with the bread that they promptly give you, and she loves the crayons and menu.  The younger upstart likes to bang on the table and destroy the crayons.  So as a family restaurant, it's not so bad.  As an adult rating the food and such, they would earn 2 stars.  But since I'm a card carrying mom, with the mini people to prove to unbelievers, I stand by my 4 stars.  So there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo?start=320
Jaclyn P.,"Woodside, CA",4,130,142,2.0,1/26/2008,Not the greatest pizza I've ever had. The pizza was not the worst I ever had but it wasn't much.

Nicole C.,"San Francisco, CA",97,68,5,1.0,10/23/2006,"HORRIBLE service.  Considering the fact that this place is a mall eatery we thought the wait would be long but we were seated right away.  Seated right away doesn't mean SERVED right away.  We must have sat in a half empty restaurant for 15-20 minutes (NO JOKE, we timed it) before a server appeared out of hiding.  But did this girl come to serve us? NO.  She went straight for the rich white couple that got seated 2 minutes ago.  I tried to be understanding and assume that she thought they were there first but she SAW us there when she would deliver food to guests around us.  For the 15-20 minutes that we waited she's walk past us several times with other guests' Ketchup, Food, Straws, EVERYTHING YOU COULD THINK OF without ever acknowledging us.  We stormed out of there so distraught from the horrible service i will never EVER eat there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo?start=320
Kim N.,"San Francisco, CA",14,87,1,3.0,3/9/2007,"i'd give this place 2.5 stars cause the service sucks here.  There is always a long wait, and once you get a table, half the menu isnt available.  Very disappointing, when you've been ready to order and once they get to you, they tell you your 3 dish selections has run out!!!  arghhhh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo?start=320
Lisa J.,"San Francisco, CA",157,118,19,2.0,6/27/2007,"OK I used to like this place for a casual and convenient lunch but after the bad service and the long wait for our food, they lost a star. I was with a really special person who deserves so much respect and while you can't go around yelling ""Hey this is a living legend I'm sitting here with people! Get with it."" I really wanted to! The food was just ok this time. Or maybe bad service makes your taste buds malfunction.

Pinky B.,"Daly City, CA",2,42,3,4.0,11/4/2007,My family loves this place. We come here at least once a month. Their pizzas and salads are delicious.

Trung N.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,29,,3.0,9/27/2009,"Pizza was OK, wasn't the best I had, wasn't the worst either.  It is pricey though for a personal pizza.  For that price, you can probably get a full pizza for the family at another pizza restaurant.  The service was good and the had TVs around the restuarant so you can catch the game while you eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo?start=320

""YOU JUST ASKED US!"" but its cool whatever. after, our waiter was pretty rude. no hi, welcome or anything...just a ""what do you want"". are you kidding me? and the plates? omg...almost all were dirty as hell. it had left over chunks of what looked like blueberry and our beer tasted like dish washing soap. learn to wash your cups please! luckily i was still nice enough to tip...tho i shouldnt have. i loved the CPK in irvine but this place im going to have to stay away from.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo?start=320

Janet P.,"San Mateo, CA",3,27,,4.0,9/27/2007,"Okay, so it's a chain and run like one. But I think they attract great staff and the food is consistently good. I've rarely had a waitress/waiter that wasn't welcoming and fun and I always enjoy the food. It's one of the rare places where you can get really good dinner salads. And I love the pizza, although I just ordered a plain cheese pizza and I wasn't completely impressed. But that's my taste. It was cooked well and presented fine. Just not to my taste. I probably should have ordered the garlic chicken pizza, because that's my favorite. My husband and love the Tortilla soup and the Thai Crunch salads. I like their draft beers and we had some kind of strawberry smoothie thing (sorry, can't remember exactly title of the drink) recently and it was quite good. It's moderately priced, so it's not cheap, but not a bad value. But I highly recommend getting there early, before six in the evening or right before noon so you don't have to wait for so long. And during Christmas, it's a nightmare wait at peak times. But overally, we really like this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo?start=340
