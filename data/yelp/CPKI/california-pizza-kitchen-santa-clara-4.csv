Jessica D.,"Santa Clara, CA",155,29,45,5.0,4/20/2017,"Came here for dinner on opening night (4/17/17) and it was great! They were pretty busy as expected, but nothing fell short in terms for service, quality of food and experience.  The place is nice and modern like all the other CPK locations. This one in particular is actually bigger than I expected it to be and the fact that it's not in a mall is great.  We ordered: -avocado club egg rolls to start (so good- we loved these) -sangria flight (pretty good! came with 3 options) -the original BBQ chicken pizza (yummy as always)  -fire-grilled rib eye (12oz, new item, my bf loved this!)  We were happy with everything we ordered and they came out in a timely manner despite being busy on opening day. Would definitely recommend the avocado club egg rolls!! Our food was fresh, flavorful and the service was friendly and welcoming. Living just down the street, we'll definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara-4?start=20

Alyssa R.,"Santa Clara, CA",15,59,33,2.0,8/26/2017,I thought people were tripping when  this place had only 3.5 stars. I give this place 2 stars one for the food and one for our waiter j.j.

Michael M.,"Alviso, San Jose, CA",4,21,7,2.0,8/18/2017,"Had lunch at the new Calif. Pizza Kitchen located within the Montecello Apartments. We arrived at 11:45am and were seated outside.  This place is huge and brand new and pretty much empty for lunch. Our waiter was friendly and courteous. We ordered the SZECHWAN CHICKEN DUMPLINGS as our starter to share. I thought I ordered the Crispy Fish Tacos and my husband ordered JAMAICAN JERK CHICKEN pizza.  Our food was delivered and very tasty. Wasn't sure if they were fish or chicken tacos.  Didn't taste like fish The plate had 3 tacos, all three had a very small piece of chicken, don't let the picture fool you!  I would say less than 3 ounces between the 3 tacos.  I would expect 6 ounces for lunch at $15.99. The 11 inch pizza which tasted good, but had very little chicken.  The last CPK I ate at was located in Palo Alto, which skimped on the chicken in their Chinese Chicken Salad. I guess things haven't changed.  That's the reason I stopped going.  The downside was the price.  $60 including tip and one soda.  No alcohol. I have no objection of paying $60-$80 dollars for a nice sit down dinner, but not for lunch.   I found this place was a bit overpriced for lunch and skimped on the chicken and most likely not going  return to CPK. That's why I gave it 2 stars. For the price, I can find better pizza and fish/chicken tacos.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara-4?start=20

Service is ok and not great.  Chicken lime fettuccine has a bitter taste.  Butter for bread is solidly cold.  Water is not refilled.  The strangest thing is the echo in this restaurant.  On this night, there aren't that many customers in the restaurant but the high pitch noises are very distractive.     Hopefully, in time all issues will be straightened out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara-4?start=20

Taylor M.,"Santa Clara, CA",1,10,4,3.0,8/20/2017,"We live in the apartments right next door and come by here when we are too tired to cook. It is super convenient! Also the outdoor seating allows dogs, so we are always welcome to eat with our pup! The manager here is also super cool. He has personally been out to our table a couple of times to give us bread/food. We always talk about our dogs and he is really friendly. The service at this location is awesome 99% of the time, with the odd exception of an inattentive waiter. The food is unfortunately not too much to write home about. It is a chain restaurant that needs to appeal to a plethora of tastes, so you get what you expect. I usually opt for the SANTE FE BOWL which is rich in flavor and uses extremely fresh/high quality ingredients. My better half usually opts for the THAI PIZZA, which has robust flavors and a delicious peanut sauce. I would definitely stay away from some things like the Jamaican Jerked Chicken pizza. It is *way* too over-seasoned and the chicken was dry. Also the Thai Salad, unlike the pizza, had dressing that was way too tangy and for 1000+ calories (for the full serving) definitely not worth it. We will absolutely be back many times, the location is great for us and they use high quality ingredients.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara-4?start=20

Our server, Carmen, was the best! We started with a few beers and some great Chardonnay (it was a school night) along with the GREAT Buffalo Cauliflower. Please treat yourself and try this. We followed with a (half) Cobb Salad, with Avocado, grilled chicken, Applewood bacon, fresh tomatoes and beets! Yum! Then, the mushroom, pepperoni and sausage pizza was 9/10ths Perfection! Finally, the red velvet cake with a side of vanilla ice cream made for a memorable meal! We can't wait to return. Props to the manager for putting on the Giants game!

Ralph T.,"Stateline, NV",14,438,28,5.0,4/23/2017,"We were here on opening day for lunch.   Service was very attentive.  I think they had all their staff there. If you drink was empty you got asked 3 times if you wanted a refill.  Finally after saying no we just said yes each time. It was a lot easier. JUST funny. I know it was their first day and they were trying to make an impression. AND THEY DID MAKE A POSITIVE IMPRESSION. We had pizza, salad, mac and cheese.  All came with bread and oil & vinegar dipping.   I must say for a new place first day it was well run and food came out on time, properly cooked and not much to want. We spoke with the manager who introduced himself. He was from Salinas and work at other CPK.   Interior is modern with unfinished ceilings and cement floors. Didn't feel crowded.

Stephanie S.,"Kihei, HI",5,3,,4.0,7/2/2017,"Traveling thru and decided on this new location of CPK.  As always the food was good. My shrimp scampi zucchini dish could have used a bit more flavor and the zucchini made the dish a little watery but it was a wonderfully portioned size and of course good enough to finish almost the whole dish.  I'd give the place five stars but there was visible dust above our table along with some left over food particles of just not a thoroughly cleaned table and some flickering lights that if I had a seizure disorder I would of been having some trouble.  Our server Jen, I can't say enough good things about her. She was upbeat,  attentive, easy to joke around with and made us feel taken care of. She gets 5 stars on her own. Great job Jen!!

I must say this location had great hospitality & warm atmosphere, we were immediately seated & greeted by our warm super friendly server Kayan whom he had a funny sense of humor & guided us throughout the menu with ease & made recommendations for us to try & so we did. We decided to try the Avocado club egg roll for our appetizers that had bacon in it sooo good!!& a few fruity cocktails can't remember the names & some beers.   For our entree we went with a variety of different pizza from the menu & I must say wow we we're not disappointed lost count of all the slices I had with all the incredible mouth pleasures one could have.

Hari S.,"Sausalito, CA",22,1,1,1.0,12/28/2017,"Inconsistent food and sloppy service: the California veggie pizza I ordered was dry and bland (not even seasoned well). We had ordered drinks and appetizers and were sitting there for more than 45m when no one checked in on us. When we asked for our main orders to be taken, we were told that the kitchen and bar had already closed. Some heads up or last call would have been good. They were then ok with putting in the pizza order which turned out to be meh. Not coming back Update: the Cali veggie is supposed to have mozzarella and sundried tomatoes and mine had neither.

Kev O.,"Irvine, CA",32,391,868,1.0,12/13/2017,"Been going to CPK for years and have never had the kind of service I had here today. We were in a hurry so decided to come here for a ""quick"" lunch since they have lunch specials. I won't even waste time going into my usual detail about the food, service, etc. as it's not worth my time. Waited over 40 minutes for our lunch! Our server seemed like a really nice young guy, but not once during that 40 minute wait did our server come and apologize and explain the looooooong delay.......oh, and did I mention we waited 40 minutes for our food?! It was only after we waved him down to ask what was happening with our food that he apologized and mentioned that the kitchen was backed up with takeout orders. And, the restaurant was less than half full!.....more like a third, maybe! Then finally came the food. Gosh, my smashed chicken meatball piadina was barely lukewarm! .....and I had to open up the piadina to search for the chicken which was tucked way on inside.....where I found the few measly pieces. This was the half piadina + salad.....I guess they must have cut the other half where all the meat was and gave it to a takeout order. Very disappointing to say the least. As we we got up and started walking to the exit, some guy who looked like he could have been the manager asked how everything was? I told hi straightforward exactly how it was. He apologized profusely but never offered any way to make up for this horrible experience. I will definitely never come back here for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara-4

Andrew T.,"Sunnyvale, CA",120,301,575,3.0,7/27/2017,"Came on a Thursday evening around 7pm. The hostess told us that it's very busy and that the wait for my party of 3 was going to take 5-10 minutes. I thought it was going to be worst because she said it was busy and there was a handful of groups ahead of us. Regardless, we got stay down in 5 minutes so it was exceptional. We sat down and ordered two pizzas. The roasted artichoke + spinach and margherita pizza off the thin crust section. We waited about less than 10 minutes for our pizzas and the waitress apologized for how long it took. Gosh I was thinking these workers sure have high standards for quality. Before the pizzas arrived, the waitress got us our waters and sourdough bread slices with olive oil with a couple of minutes. Pizza came out and the first one I dug into was the roasted artichoke + spinach and thought the toppings were kind of dry. I also noticed the cheese wasn't as warm and looked as if it was resting for a bit before we got served. 2/5 for the roasted artichoke + spinach pizza. However the margherita pizza was pretty good. The freshly diced tomatoes near the crust was very refreshing. The only downside was that the cheese wasn't as warm as I would have liked and the topping wasn't spread out evenly all round the pizza. 3/5 for the margherita pizza. So I can understand why the waitresses apologized for the long wait as our pizza was probably resting for awhile after it got out of the oven. Given that, the pizzas were just okay to me. I'm sure it may have been better if we got straight from the oven.   SERVICE: Outstanding, I've read several reviews about poor service but I have had no issues here. Super attentive waitress and she even made my friend a side of pesto from scratch when  she asked for some. 5/5 stars for the service alone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara-4

I've gone on multiple occasions getting different pizzas and can honestly say I've have frozen pizzas better than CPK's. The Buffalo cauliflower is drowned in Buffalo sauce  and you end up paying a dollar per cauliflower piece...

Spacious, bright indoor dining area as well as a nice patio outdoors.  For my food, I ordered the California Club pizza and was totally disappointed with this! The presentation was nice, but totally lacking in the flavor department -  The pizza was extremely dry, with excessive amount of arugula. Also, they seem to have forgotten to add the caesar sauce that's supposed to bind all the greens together. Hence bland, dry and bitter taste (from the arugula). Fail.

As I walked to the take out counter I noticed a lot of people waiting, looking unhappy. As I paid, someone said they had been waiting 40 minutes. I asked if my food was ready because I would have cancelled the order if it wouldn't be ready for 40 minutes. I was told my pizza and pasta were ready and they were just waiting for the wedge salad. I waited an additional 15 minutes for my salad. The couple next to me had been waiting almost an hour and were inquiring how much longer. The girls were saying how everyone in the kitchen was ""pissed off"" and ""super slow"" and it wasn't their fault. At no point did a manager come over and speak to myself or the other couple waiting. I asked for my money back for the salad and the cashier left to ""find a manager"" the other cashier slipped my salad into my bag and I left.

Most of the other CPK's bar area's are overlooking the pizza oven so it was disappointing that wasn't the case at this location. We ordered the chips and guacamole to start and our entrees. The entrees came out and as soon as the waitress set them down she spilled my husband's entire soda all over the table, spilling out and over into the booth and partly on my pants. She barely apologized and we had to ask her to get a rag. Not only that but instead of rushing to fix the mistake she slowly walked over to get a rag like she didn't really care to fix the problem. Totally put a damper on the rest of the dining experience. I actually had to get up from the booth to get more napkins because the area was still soaked. Not only that but we were still eating our appetizer before she spilled the soda everywhere and she took it away without asking. The only time she apologized was when she was giving us the check.

Andrew T.,"Sunnyvale, United States",120,301,575,3.0,27/7/2017,"Came on a Thursday evening around 7pm. The hostess told us that it's very busy and that the wait for my party of 3 was going to take 5-10 minutes. I thought it was going to be worst because she said it was busy and there was a handful of groups ahead of us. Regardless, we got stay down in 5 minutes so it was exceptional. We sat down and ordered two pizzas. The roasted artichoke + spinach and margherita pizza off the thin crust section. We waited about less than 10 minutes for our pizzas and the waitress apologized for how long it took. Gosh I was thinking these workers sure have high standards for quality. Before the pizzas arrived, the waitress got us our waters and sourdough bread slices with olive oil with a couple of minutes. Pizza came out and the first one I dug into was the roasted artichoke + spinach and thought the toppings were kind of dry. I also noticed the cheese wasn't as warm and looked as if it was resting for a bit before we got served. 2/5 for the roasted artichoke + spinach pizza. However the margherita pizza was pretty good. The freshly diced tomatoes near the crust was very refreshing. The only downside was that the cheese wasn't as warm as I would have liked and the topping wasn't spread out evenly all round the pizza. 3/5 for the margherita pizza. So I can understand why the waitresses apologized for the long wait as our pizza was probably resting for awhile after it got out of the oven. Given that, the pizzas were just okay to me. I'm sure it may have been better if we got straight from the oven.   SERVICE: Outstanding, I've read several reviews about poor service but I have had no issues here.

Spacious, bright indoor dining area as well as a nice patio outdoors.  For my food, I ordered the California Club pizza and was totally disappointed with this! The presentation was nice, but totally lacking in the flavor department -  The pizza was extremely dry, with excessive amount of arugula. Also, they seem to have forgotten to add the caesar sauce that's supposed to bind all the greens together. Hence bland, dry and bitter taste (from the arugula). Fail.  The service at this particular location, however, was super nice, our server was friendly and happy to talk with us. Just too bad the food didn't match the service, nor the ambiance. Overall, this is not my favorite CPK, but best of luck!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara-4

This one in particular is actually bigger than I expected it to be and the fact that it's not in a mall is great.  We ordered: -avocado club egg rolls to start (so good- we loved these) -sangria flight (pretty good! came with 3 options) -the original BBQ chicken pizza (yummy as always)  -fire-grilled rib eye (12oz, new item, my bf loved this!)

We arrived at 11:45am and were seated outside.  This place is huge and brand new and pretty much empty for lunch. Our waiter was friendly and courteous. We ordered the SZECHWAN CHICKEN DUMPLINGS as our starter to share. I thought I ordered the Crispy Fish Tacos and my husband ordered JAMAICAN JERK CHICKEN pizza.  Our food was delivered and very tasty. Wasn't sure if they were fish or chicken tacos.  Didn't taste like fish The plate had 3 tacos, all three had a very small piece of chicken, don't let the picture fool you!  I would say less than 3 ounces between the 3 tacos.  I would expect 6 ounces for lunch at $15.99. The 11 inch pizza which tasted good, but had very little chicken.  The last CPK I ate at was located in Palo Alto, which skimped on the chicken in their Chinese Chicken Salad. I guess things haven't changed.  That's the reason I stopped going.  The downside was the price.  $60 including tip and one soda.  No alcohol. I have no objection of paying $60-$80 dollars for a nice sit down dinner, but not for lunch.   I found this place was a bit overpriced for lunch and skimped on the chicken and most likely not going  return to CPK. That's why I gave it 2 stars. For the price, I can find better pizza and fish/chicken tacos.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara-4?start=20

Also the outdoor seating allows dogs, so we are always welcome to eat with our pup! The manager here is also super cool. He has personally been out to our table a couple of times to give us bread/food. We always talk about our dogs and he is really friendly. The service at this location is awesome 99% of the time, with the odd exception of an inattentive waiter. The food is unfortunately not too much to write home about. It is a chain restaurant that needs to appeal to a plethora of tastes, so you get what you expect. I usually opt for the SANTE FE BOWL which is rich in flavor and uses extremely fresh/high quality ingredients. My better half usually opts for the THAI PIZZA, which has robust flavors and a delicious peanut sauce. I would definitely stay away from some things like the Jamaican Jerked Chicken pizza. It is *way* too over-seasoned and the chicken was dry. Also the Thai Salad, unlike the pizza, had dressing that was way too tangy and for 1000+ calories (for the full serving) definitely not worth it.

Patty R.,"Stockton, United States",2,53,16,4.0,26/4/2017,This is by far the nicest California Pizza Kitchen that I've been to. It's a great addition to Santa Clara. I appreciate the aesthetics. Food is pretty standard if you've ever been to a CPK - which means fresh pizza and yummy pasta. The only complaint I have are the servers. All of them are really nice and helpful but I felt like too many people were on staff the first time I visited. I couldn't actually eat comfortably without a waiter coming to the table every two minutes asking if I needed anything or taking away my drink or plates and utensils when I wasn't finished. lol it's honestly not a huge deal since I know this is a new location and they will get the hang of things soon. :) I probably will return!,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara-4?start=40
JennandDarren M.,"San Jose, United States",1,38,2,4.0,14/4/2017,"We ordered takeout at their soft opening.  It was super packed, but we still got our order in a reasonable amount of time (20 mins) .   We had the Thai chicken and Garlic Chicken pizzas which were both pretty good. We had lowered expectations for the soft opening, but we were very impressed by the quality of the food and the friendliness and promptness of the service. Can only rate based on takeout so far, but they look good so far. Hope they keep it up!    The restaurant is located in the Monticello apartment/retail complex which includes a future Nob Hill grocery store, and some more restaurants (Konjoe Burger and Yellow Chili Indian)  to be open later this year.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara-4?start=40
Bob E.,"Santa Clara, United States",0,1,,2.0,26/7/2017,"Food is VERY good. Service is okay, but they're new and still learning. The deal breaker for this place is the clientele - even late the restaurant is full of young families with screaming children. If you are a young family with screaming children this is a great place to come. If you enjoy being serenaded by screaming children you'll love it here. If you are a screaming child great news - the entire restaurant is one large open space with absolutely no attempt at deadening the sound, so you can be secure in the knowledge that everyone in the entire restaurant will be enjoying your performance. Absolutely never going back.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara-4?start=40
Jason G.,"Santa Clara, United States",0,14,2,5.0,19/4/2017,Yaaaas cum thru finally this side of Santa Clara is getting restaurants and more retail. We've been lonely over here!,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara-4?start=40
Meghan N.,"San Jose, United States",11,167,40,3.0,8/5/2017,"Was excited to try the new location because the only other location that is closest to my place is attached to the mall so parking can be a nightmare. The restaurant itself is really pretty and open. I liked the bar area but there wasn't room for our party of 3. We sat a high top in the bar area. Most of the other CPK's bar area's are overlooking the pizza oven so it was disappointing that wasn't the case at this location. We ordered the chips and guacamole to start and our entrees. The entrees came out and as soon as the waitress set them down she spilled my husband's entire soda all over the table, spilling out and over into the booth and partly on my pants. She barely apologized and we had to ask her to get a rag. Not only that but instead of rushing to fix the mistake she slowly walked over to get a rag like she didn't really care to fix the problem. Totally put a damper on the rest of the dining experience. I actually had to get up from the booth to get more napkins because the area was still soaked. Not only that but we were still eating our appetizer before she spilled the soda everywhere and she took it away without asking. The only time she apologized was when she was giving us the check. I would come back but if that same girl was our server I would request a new one because the way she handled the situation was horrible.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara-4?start=40
Jennifer T.,"San Jose, United States",0,2,,4.0,14/4/2017,"I was very fortunate to accompany my sister to the soft opening of CPK's newest location (Special thanks to Johnny for the invite.) Any hoot,  they did not disappoint! Like all newly opening restaurant their will be a few bumps along the way. However it looks as if this staff works very well together and has great support from their management team. They our defenitly headed the right direction! I also love that they used their soft opening as an opportunity to raise money for make a wish. Props!  P. S.  You won't go wrong starting off with any of their Sangritas!
