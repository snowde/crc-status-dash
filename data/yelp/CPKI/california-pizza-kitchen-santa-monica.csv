H H.,"Santa Monica, CA",2,14,,4.0,11/25/2017,"I intended to go to Hillstone down the street but the wait was too long and all I had was 30 min. on my meter so I decided to head back to my car and go to another area that wasn't as packed.   I was parked right in front of California Pizza Kitchen, so I spontaneously opted to eat here instead.  The place was packed but there wasn't a wait so I was seated immediately.  But because it was packed, my food didn't come out for about 20 minutes.  I had only 6 minutes left on my meter so I asked an employee walking by if he knew whether the meter in front of his restaurant would allow me to just add more money or if it was one of those meters that won't allow you to recycle.   He didn't know the answer.  Now most people would have said I don't know and walk away.  Luis Pablo however inquired around and then inform me that I would need to move my car because it's one of those meters that won't allow you to refill.   Now if you're familiar with the 3rd Street Promenade area, you'll know that the minute you drive out of your parking space, there will be someone who will immediately pull in as this is a heavily visited area, especially on a Saturday of the Thanksgiving weekend.  To my pleasant surprise, Luis offered to block the space for me as I pull out and then pull back in.  It only took me 2 minutes to get this done but the fact that he offered to go the extra mile to help me speaks volume on his exemplary customer service.   If the food was excellent, I would have given this place 5 stars, but since the food was good but not necessarily excellent, I'm giving this restaurant 4 star, again predominantly for Luis' superlative customer service than the food.  The garlic chicken dish was not as tender as my personal palate would have preferred (possibly over cooked and hence somewhat on the dry side). I also felt that the sauce was a bit salty for my personal palate (but most restaurants are a little too salty for my low sodium preference).  I did enjoy my cucumber reviver drink however. I don't review all the restaurants I eat at, only ones that either impressed me or unimpressed me.  I'm not so sure I would associate my receiving outstanding service to the training at CPK because if this were the case, I would have been equally impressed by my waiter, which I wasn't.  He did a decent enough job but it wasn't necessarily anything to write home about.   I made it a point to look at Luis uniform the next time he walked by so I could see his name tag, only then did I discover that he was a culinary lead.  All this time I thought he was just a busboy.  I'm not sure what a culinary lead is necessarily but that ""lead"" tells me he must be a leader of some sort.  I can totally see why CPK elected to make him a leader.  He not only represents his company well, he is truly a deserving asset to this restaurant.  It's the small simple thing like this (which most can do but won't) that makes a visit memorable and an employee to stand out above the rest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-monica
Rose B.,"Los Angeles, CA",52,478,1780,3.0,1/8/2018,Not bad. Okay food. Decent good service.  Ordered a BBQ Chicken Pizza which was ok. Shareable for two.  Also got the BBQ Chicken Salad with avocado. It was mixed with ranch. We got some cracked pepper and some cheese on it. Nothing great.  I'm not sure why but not a big fan of CPK.  Bread was good served with oil.   Clean place.

Yahel E.,"Santa Monica, CA",4,8,1,2.0,9/25/2017,I called in for take out to order a Full original chopped salad (what i usually order) and when i got there it was in a different (much smaller) container. I have been eating at CPK my whole life and have ordered this salad sooo many times. I know what the portions are like and this was definitely not it. I spoke to the manager and he said it is all measure and it is just all condensed together so i said okay. I got home and put it in the bowl from home and it was half as much as usual. Usually I split this with another person and get full but i was completely hungry after. I paid over $17 for this????? Not acceptable. If you're going to cut down on your portions then give your customers a lower price because now i am still hungry and disappointed in the service. Makes me never want to come back again.   I'm giving 2 stars because usually I am satisfied but the fact the I am writing a review shows a lot because I usually don't.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-monica

Esteban L.,"Beverly Hills, CA",41,3,,4.0,1/12/2018,"Was craving a chicken chipotle for days and finally ended up at CPK on a Friday night.   After devouring their amazing fried macaroni while drinking some Pinot Grigio I was served my entree.  Unfortunately half way through I discovered something unfortunate. Upon notifying my server she quickly remedied the situation and even though I didn't want a new pizza she was kind enough to offer me a dessert on the house.

Tiffany C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2001,829,6051,4.0,5/31/2017,"Haven't had CPK in awhile - came to Santa Monica on a cold Saturday evening for my birthday, wanting to celebrate by the pier. But unfortunately it was raining incredibly hard by the time we made it out to Santa Monica. Ended up ducking into CPK for dinner and to wait out the rain.  This CPK is a bit fancier than the ones I've been to. Seems like the floorplan is executed well - with a round, bar-like area in the middle with low lights hanging over the seats. Very comfy indeed. Right when you walk in, you're greeted at the front of the house by several workers. Because we came during a huge storm, there weren't too many customers and the workers seemed to be much more relaxed and eager for the holidays. We were told to sit anywhere we wanted. Very friendly service, and our server was super chill and helpful throughout the night.  Ended up ordering the classic CPK dishes that I usually enjoy eating.  Fettucine Alfredo with chicken: Even though the portion size isn't too big, the creaminess of the alfredo sauce really packs a punch, getting you full pretty quickly. With the added parmesan cheese and chicken pieces, this dish was a hit. I've always been a fan of this dish at all CPK's, and this one didn't disappoint.  BBQ Chicken pizza: a classic pizza although this time it didn't taste as good as I remembered it to taste. A bit dry and not as tasty (maybe the sauce was lacking on the pizza?); but nonetheless, it hit the spot and satisfied our hunger cravings.  And our server was incredibly nice, throwing in a birthday dessert surprise for me, topped with a candle and whipped cream! I think it was some sort of brownie with chocolate syrup, whipped cream, and some candy - it definitely ended the night on a high note.  Don't forget to ask for complimentary bread and dip once you have ordered.  tl;dr - Solid food although I would probably expect a bit more from this CPK since it's located close to the pier. The service was pretty great, putting us both at ease despite the heavy rain outside. Wasn't disappointed at all that I ended up celebrating my birthday here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-monica
Ryan W.,"San Pedro, CA",0,2,1,2.0,9/14/2017,"2 Stars: 1 bc the bartender was cool AF, 1 bc they offered to refund my lunch. We roll into CPK for lunch and go to take out counter, the place has 3, maybe 4 tables in it. I order the chicken alfredo, it comes out to $18.18. a bit sticker shocked for noodles and chicken, but whatever. It takes 30 minutes for 4 orders to be ready, with an empty dining room. When i get back to my desk, I open my bag to pull out the most half a$$ed, plastic container of noodles i've ever seen. I've uploaded a photo of the B.S.!

Giulianna G.,"Torrance, CA",2,72,55,1.0,3/26/2017,"Our family came here to celebrate my grandmother's birthday. Ten of us were seated rather quickly. The reason I'm giving this place two stars is due to the fact that the waiters did not know how to properly provide customer service and the food took forever to be made. The waiter brought 5 pieces of bread for the entire table.  Keep in mind there were ten people in our party. Also, we had to keep asking for bread because it wasn't enough.  The pea soup was okay and the bread was okay.  The waitress brought tea without the tea cup.  The food took about 30 minutes to be made. I don't think I will be returning.  Our entrees finally arrived and what a disappointment.  The quinoa and arugula salad was dry. The mahi mahi tacos were dry and had zero flavor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-monica

Their pizza is really good and you can either order from the menu or customize it anyway you wish. I love avocado rolls, they have a lot of calories but so worth it. In the summer they serve sangria tastings which is 3 variety of sangria  drinks with different flavors, it's so yummy!!! Their fish tacos are pretty tasty too. Really anything we tried was good. On the side note, they host kids cooking classes and I signed my daughter up, it was so much fun! Kids got to make their own pizzas!

Amita S.,"Panorama City, Los Angeles, CA",2,17,20,1.0,10/20/2017,One of the worst CPK's  I have been to and I have been to quiet a few. Went there yesterday evening it took them 40 mins to come check on us after we sat down. Then we ordered our food and waited 30 to 35 mins and at that point I got fed up and just walked out. They didn't even bring us bread and the manger clearly saw us sitting there but did nothing to resolve the issue or help us out. I will never be going to this CPK again.

Sara T.,"West Hollywood, CA",237,213,51,4.0,5/22/2017,"I'm not super in love with CPK because their foods tend to be super salty/fatty. However, if you are looking for delicious food that you will want more and more of, then you are coming to the right place. They have so many options on their menu and I've had almost all of them over the years. If you have never tried CPK, you really should give it chance because they have such a wide selection of delicious pizzas, salads, kinds of pasta, and sandwiches. I love this place because it is a quick in-and-out for lunch and the service is always great. They also have a rewards program so you can add up points from all your purchases and save money over time. It's a decent place so go there if you're just trying to have some good food. not a good date place and not fancy or classy in any way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-monica

Since we moved to CA we have been to a lot of CPK restaurants and we figured we would give the Santa Monica location a try.  For the most part, 80% of our CPK visits up in NorCal were positive ones.

Why a restaurant would continue serving alcohol to young kids, as full drinks were being knocked off the table onto the floor is beyond me.  This was totally irresponsible behavior on the part of Management and I would never go back to this place.  I know as a fact that we were not the only table that complained about these kids.

My friend got up and asked the manager if she could use a phone charger because her phone was dead, and he said no. So when she came back to the table and said ""the manager's kind of a douchebag."" Little did she know he followed her back to the table, and then he yelled at her for like 5 mins, making a scene, saying he won't be disrespected like that, and how there's kids around, which is like... yeah okay no one can hear us talking quietly amongst ourselves, and he literally wouldn't let up, he tried to force her to apologize which I thought was super creepy. Then as he was leaving she said he was being dramatic and he came back and started yelling all over again. He was like inconsolable. I thought it was really unprofessional and embarrassing for him and I won't be dining there again for sure. Food was good though if that's what you're into.

The flat bread is pretty much pizza; but because it's smaller than a pizza I feel like I am being good. Call it cheating if you wish, I am in denial here.  I've never tried their cocktails here so can't comment too much on that, however my friends have ordered a few and said they weren't bad.

When attempting to wave down someone for refills we kept getting walked past and at one point had their older bus boy stare at us as we attempted to get help, he made sure not to help as well. When we received our appetizer and salad I was very disappointed in the salad it was a very small ""half"" portion I can only assume that the ""large"" would make a small salad at ""Buca di Beppo"" (for those who know the sizes) definitely not worth the price they charge. We then received the pizza. That too was not worth what they charge. 15$ for a pizza the size of a traditional round china plate and 14$ for the other equally small pizza. For half that price I can make from scratch a better fresh pizza because YES the pizza sent to us both had old ingredients you could clearly see had begun to rot. I spoke to the manager who apologized and said they had a new expediter and replaced the browning smooshy avocados with fresh green ones. Over all we spent 110$ and ate one third of what we order. We took food to go after picking off rotting vegetables but collectively agreed that the local homeless may appreciate the food as we had all lost out appetites. Personally I would not recommend this location to anyone. Staff is lacking in good work ethic and someone dropped the ball on restroom cleaning hard.

This CPK is pretty awesome since they are open to 11pm, i came in around 10 and they still serve all the same things and the service is faster to, otherwise the service could be hit or miss.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-monica?start=120
Chaunda L.,"Los Angeles, CA",127,13,1,1.0,3/15/2015,"I just enjoyed the Jambalaya pasta at California Pizza. The food was Great!! but the customer service was unprofessional. At the end of my meal, I was told about a 20% discount that people could get if they work on the 3rd St Promenade. Well, I work on 2nd (around the corner). The bar manger Jake was extremely rude when letting me know that I couldn't receive the discount. Instead of saying ""Hey we normally don't give the 20% discount unless you work on the promenade"" he opted to shout it out and say that it was only for promenade employees. The manner in which he handled the situation was extremely unnecessary. He made it very clear that I wasn't a valued customer. My bill was $17.84, 20% would have been $3.57. Jake was so worried about losing ALMOST $4 instead of me returning back. I definitely won't go back and I'll make sure to let my coworkers know so they think twice about going there themselves.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-monica?start=120

Service was fabulous, although I didn't catch the young man's name.  He was a tall, slender, Caucasian young fellow - who provided excellent service and obviously knew what he was doing (as do I).

Louis D.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,60,6,2.0,11/29/2013,I have gone hear before and had a great experience and normally they always give pretty good service. However this time was totally horrid except for the one waiter I dealt with.  I come inside the building and the hostess says hello then just looks at me. Then she asks would you like a seat I think well umm no shit ya think I came in here looking to eat would you like my money or not? Anywho she seats me then goes off and tells the waiter about his new table however instead of saying it to him personally she yells it across the entire business. It then turns out my waiter has maybe 3 tables in the entire building and the other guy has more than 10 tables to himself and the other waiters have a few aswell. I sat there for over 10 minutes never saw the waiter he never came over hostess never asked if I was being helped even though I was seated right behind them. Appareantly my waiter has time to be laughing kidding joking and yelling around the resturant about how a previous customer I saw seated along the wall walked off and didnt pay at all. Again not something that should be yelled across the entire resturant over and over and over again over another 10 minute period of me not being helped finally the other waiter who had more than ten tables came over and asked if I was being helped I said I think that guy is the waiter but I have never seen him nor heard from him in over 20 minutes now so no guess im not being helped. He said of well can I take your order than said but im not your waiter. At this point I just ordered my drink and food at the same time because who knows when someone would be back for my order. Now once I recieved my food the pizza looked good and smelled great like normal and until I picked up the slice the dough I dont think was cooked completely as the slice fell apart andd no matter how you held the thing just kept falling apart. I personally wish I would have just got up walked away and refused to pay for this food as it was disgusting. I wondered the entire time if there manager was on vacation and that was why they were acting like raging college kids at a party or something. Well just that one guy was behaving that way. I mean just kjepy running around talking laughing super loud yelling to other employees across the room just annoying while his other employees were working there buts off and he wasnt. I wont be a repeat customer again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-monica?start=120

Chris C.,"Long Beach, CA",37,20,7,2.0,11/6/2014,I'm gonna give two stars for the great pizza and zero stars for the weak service. Went here on a Wednesday night and the restaurant seemed pretty slow so there really is no excuse for the weak service. My girlfriend ordered a strawberry mojito and what she got back was a strawberry margarita. Great. We ordered the habanero carnitas pizza and it was delicious but our server didn't offer any parmesan cheese or pepper to go along with our pizza. And what really pissed me off was that our waitress didn't come around to see if we needed anything else. if she would have checked in on us she would have seen that we needed a refill for our waters but she  didn't and we were over there eating the spiciest pizza that CPK has to offer. Overall I'll probably eat here again just because the food is good but I'll probably stop by a 7/11 beforehand and grab something to drink to go along with my meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-monica?start=100
Sukhraj B.,"Orange, CA",1725,1189,1870,4.0,2/25/2013,"After eating a big meal of Thai food and getting some ice cream, I didn't think I'd be hungry however we spent a good 3 or 4 hours browsing the Barnes and Noble nearby after a while, I was feeling hunger pangs again. We got here about an hour and half before closing. The promenade was mostly empty by this late hour which means so was the restaurant. We were seated quickly in a booth and service is prompt and attentive.  Since it was late at night, I was freezing. I ordered a bowl of their tortilla soup and it hit the spot. Warmed me up and I was ready for the appetizer and the main meal. After quickly browsing, we both decided on the guacamole. It arrived a bit bland and we seasoned it with some table salt. Not bad after that but the portion is tiny. I don't think I'd order this again. I'm a big fan of guacamole and you have to give me more guac than that or give me equal shares of both or none at all. For my main meal, I went with the BLT pizza. It wasn't bad but I probably won't order it again. The chilled lettuce on top cools the whole pizza down which then gives it a weird taste. I like my pizza hot. This is probably a bad idea for a pizza. I do however enjoy their other pizza offerings.  Overall, it wasn't a bad meal.

Sean L.,"Palms, Los Angeles, CA",1113,175,,4.0,1/2/2013,"Happy new year! We came here on NYE around 7:30 to get a good base in our stomach before the all night binge drinking marathon.  Great decision.  4 guys. We were headed to The Penthouse at the Huntley shortly after around 9:15. It's right across the street, so it worked out perfectly. We were greeted promptly by a cute girl who sat us immediately. We sat in a booth. Very comfortable and relaxed environment. There were actually quite a few families there.  I can't remember our waiters name, but he kicked major butt. He was from Boston and had a very thick accent. Good lookin' redheaded guy.  He playfully bantered with us for awhile and was great at checking on us.  At one point, I even spilled my beer everywhere. I ordered a Samuel Adams Winter Lager on tap. I was telling a story about the time my friends neighbor got cock-blocked by Brian Urlacher and the next thing I know, my beer is all over the floor and table. I wasn't even drunk....haha.  Our waiter was on point. He came right over and got me a brand new beer. He also made a smart ass remark that killed at the table.  We ordered a BBQ Hawaiian pizza and a meat lovers pizza. The pizzas were good, but the portions were very weak. There were four of us. Two pizzas should have been enough. Also, they bring bread to the table, and we only got four pieces of bread. I was still hungry after the meal.  If the portions were bigger, this place would get 5 stars in my book.  Great service is really hard to come by, especially in SaMo, but this place was above and beyond.  PROS: Great service -Relaxed atmosphere and vibe -Quick -Delicious -BREAD! CONS: Terribly small portions I think I'll go back here by myself and eat a pizza by myself.  Enjoy the food and drinks - ask for the dude from Harvard Bar!

Today was the last straw.  I called in an order and had to repeatedly call back before I was not on hold. When I told them that I have been on hold for over 10mins for someone to take my order, the person on the other end said something within the lines of ""We're really busy. Maybe you can call back later."" and then hung up.   The ONLY reason I have gone back for take out is because I love their salads and sometimes I just crave them.   Now, I understand that they are near the Promenade and they are busy.  But, guess what?!  Almost every restaurant in Boston and New York gets busy during the lunch rush.  In fact, they are even busier than this one.  The difference is that other places don't seem to be chaotic or disorganized.  Who is managing this place?   I will be venturing to Marina Del Rey from now on if I really need my CPK salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-monica?start=180

A lot of waiters don't consider a baby's natural tendency to grab EVERYTHING in front of them, so it's nice to get a waitress who actually thinks about that kind of thing. The upside to this CPK is that it's near 3rd Street Promenade and also within walking distance of the Pier, but that's also its downfall, since there are always quite a number of homeless people out front.

Felicia T.,"Las Vegas, NV",80,276,192,2.0,5/8/2010,"Typical family franchise restaurant. Lots of kids (in fact every table had at least 2 kids), Uninspired food (pizza, pizza, sandwich, pizza, sandwich), big menu selection (to make them seem inspired with their food offerings), and very lackluster service. You first wait a bit to be seated, then wait a bit to have a waiter come and greet you, and wait to get your drink. Then you'll wait.. and wait... and wait.. to get refill. See the pattern here?  Ordered the CPK standard:  the original BBQ chicken pizza, and the new sandwich, Chicken salad sandwich with cranberry and walnut. They taste ok. Taste like food that is prepared the same way, 100 times a day, and go thru the same mundane assembly line. The sandwich was more saliva-inducing than the pizza to me. Cranberry gave a nice tart balance and walnut provided the crunchy texture it needed. Too little chicken i feel. I had it with the herb focaccia, which was well toasted. As a side, i chose a szechwan slaw. Dressing on the cabbage was vinegar-soy sauce-ginger base. It wasn't bad. Needed something to it though. So my beef was with the waiter. He was smiley and overly friendly (sometimes phoney?) when we arrived. Got us our drinks (just iced tea mind you).. first round. Refill never came. In fact he was MIA the rest of the night. Another waiter brought out our food, and after waiting for 15 min to get our glasses refilled, i had to flag down a different waiter and told him ours has been missing and all we wanted was iced tea. No problem, this one refilled it in a jiffy. Our waiter turned around the corner (after being gone for a bit) and saw our tea refilled by someone else, fearing his tip is in jeopardy I think, came over and said ""Oh i totaly would have refilled that! i wanted to give you guys new tea"". Yea right. You didn't even once walked by/ peeked at/ checked in our table. Your 6th sense told you? So finally, check time. That took 10 more minutes because he was busy showing fellow waitresses his iphone (pics?) and giggling in the corner. Waiting tables at CPK, dare i say, is not hard. There isn't a lot of wine knowledge to learn, nothing to flambee table side, nothing to cut in front of you. Just take the damn order, turn the ticket to kitchen, and make sure drinks are refilled. Too much to ask for, apparently. I waved at him one last time and he then remembered about our check. Gave the standard 20%.

The second time was last week.  We waited roughly around 10 minutes which wasn't bad and was seated pretty close to the television mounted near the bar, but too bad the Laker game was over by the time we sat down.  I don't remember our server's name, however, I do remember he was from Oklahoma because his name tag had ""Oklahoma"" written underneath his name and I had asked him if that's where he really was from.  He was friendly at first but throughout the night he would disappear for long periods of time. I forget what he did but he was just really inattentive and he even rushed us for the bill.  We were playing card games and he said that we could hang out for as long as we wanted too as long as we paid the bill first.  Uhh, what?  We paid the bill and one of our party members went to the restroom and overheard our server in the back loudly and angrily complaining to another server about how he's always the first to arrive on his shift and how he's always the last to go home or something.  Very unprofessional. Speaking of unprofessional, while we were waiting for a table, the Laker game was still going on.  A lot of diners cheered loudly when Lakers made the winning shot, along with a few other servers.  The hostess who was right next to us, said to herself with attitude (but loudly enough for us to hear), ""Yeah, cheer again, if you don't want to keep your job.""

We walked in and requested a low volume table in order to carry on a conversation. Near the front window we noticed an empty table.  We asked the hostess if we could sit there, being the quieter area than the rest of the restaurant.  She paused and said ""no, there's already 8 tables assigned to that waiter, sorry.""  She suggested sitting at a table by the bar, what? That was noisier. She paused again, then said ""there's tables in back."" Walked back, sat down, sniff sniff, unpleasant odors  (near the restrooms).  Back up to the front again. Asked her for an open table where we could carry on a conversation. She said ""walk around, find a table, I'll have someone follow you."" Scored a table in the middle of the restaurant, a huge booth.

The salad was refreshing, cold and crunchy.  Minus 2 stars for the hostess putting us through the wringer on our request for a decent table/seating arrangement.

Lia K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,,1.0,6/28/2013,"Do you enjoy decent service and moderately attentive/intelligent waiters who don't leave you sitting at your table for up to 40+ minutes without so much as a status update regarding your food? Does it irk you when you watch patrons seated a good 20 minutes after you beginning to eat their meals while you sit, staring at your table  and wishing you'd gone anywhere else? Do you take offense when you ask for something simple, such as the check, and your waiter decides that he has better things to do? If so, avoid the CPK on Wilshire. If you decide to give it a try anyway and you're feeling extra masochistic/want to enjoy your meal with a side of all-consuming rage, ask for Leonardo, the worst server in the history of chain restaurant dining. My coworkers and I are partially to blame, I suppose. We've gone to this location more than a few times for our Friday group outings and we've always known the service has only barely toed the line of being passable. Perhaps we grew TOO comfortable with the location, however, as the service last time should've been a tip (something the waiters at this location rarely deserve) to never come back. 90 minutes to churn out salads and a pizza? In fairness, everyone has a bad day and since we'd become something like ""regulars"" at this CPK, we returned, promising to give it another chance. Never again. Leonardo, Leonardo, Leonardo... How can I begin to describe your rude, off-putting demeanor, ineptitude, and generally horrendous service? As a timeline, we arrived on 06/28/13 at 12:05 to a nearly empty restaurant and waited about 10 minutes as he ran around looking like a chicken with his head chopped off. After taking our orders, we waited. And waited. And waited. Around 12:40, we finally managed to flag him down and he said that the restaurant had been flooded with to-go orders and to be patient. Well, that might be a decent excuse if the patrons who'd been seated 15 minutes after us hadn't already begun eating. We asked him to bring our checks with our meals (if they ever came) because we had to get back to the office. We even left the credit cards out for him so it could be a quick exchange. Yet, when our food came, there were no checks. In fact, we had to BEG for him to bring us our bills and that prompted a very rude, ""HOLD ON, I'M GETTING TO IT!"", complete with a dismissive wave of the hand. Keep in mind, we asked for the checks around 12:40 and it was now 1PM. When he finally decided he couldn't find anymore excuses to ignore us, he took our cards and disappeared again, casually walking around and taking NEW orders rather than going to the cash register, which it turned out was also too much for him to handle. Since I'm being thorough, I guess I should also mention that when he brought us CPK's ongoing promotional ""Thank You Cards"", he threw them at us so disdainfully that they landed in a graceless pile on a plate, nearly splashing one of us with a bright pink sauce. I'm not entirely certain, but I believe that when your service is already as poor as Leonardo's, you should at least make an effort to preserve the few pennies that you've earned of your tip. I finally couldn't take it anymore and had to complain to the manager, who was, in my mind, the one redeeming part of this lunch venture (and the only reason this place deserves the 1 star that I'm giving it). If the rest of the staff at this restaurant had 1/1000000 of the professionalism as the nice Polish manager, whose name I don't know, I might come back. As it is, even with the free meal coupon, I will NOT be returning to this location because it isn't worth the horrible taste this branch leaves in my mouth. CPK on Wilshire, do yourself a favor before you lose all your regular patrons: fire Leonardo--heck, fire your entire current lunchtime wait staff, they're all equally bad--and hire people with a basic understanding of working in the food service industry. Actually, even a pack of monkeys might be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-monica?start=140

When ordering, I tend to stick with the pizzas or sandwiches. The chicken salad sandwich is great, and the tortilla soup is amazing (comes with a sandwich).  My only complaint, being lactose intolerant, is the fact that they don't offer pizza's with soy cheese. Yes, I know CPK is a chain, but the location IS in Santa Monica after all. Given how many vegan/vegetarian restaurants are in the area, you'd think they'd get the hint. I will add, however, that when I asked my server last time why they didn't offer soy cheese she responded that they have a customer who actually brings his own cheese in and the chefs will make his pizza with it.

Anthony N.,"Playa del Rey, CA",4974,2742,19397,2.0,4/24/2010,"Most California Pizza Kitchens seem to do pretty well, but this one was pretty empty when we went (granted, it was a weeknight).  Still, I walked by it later on a weekend afternoon and it was very empty again. CPK menus are the same no matter where you go (pizzas, pastas, salads, and a small number of sandwiches).  Almost all of their dishes are below $20 (with many below $15) so its pricing is comparable to other chains.  I am not really a big fan of their pizza.  I do not like the crust and for some reason, the pizza often does not seem hot enough.  I usually go for their pastas, which are okay (depending on what you get).  Over the last few years, they have started to add entrees such as crab cakes and salmon though I feel these entrees are not worth the extra cost. The complimentary bread is not the best bread out there, but I ate it up all the same.  It is a simple sliced French bread, and it does not take on butter that well as it tears the bread apart. Some of their pastas are small like the Portobello mushroom ravioli (which I like).  I wanted something a little more filling so I opted for the Kung Pao Spaghetti with Chicken.  The spaghetti had some heat to it, which was good, and it was seasoned right overall.  The spaghetti was cooked right.  They really skimped on the chicken; I think CPK is often stingy with the proteins (on pastas), which is a little frustrating given that they usually charge extra for proteins (chicken, shrimp).  In the chicken's place, there was an inordinate amount of peanuts in the pasta. For dessert, my friend and I both went with the tiramisu.  I like their sticky toffee pudding with ice cream, but it looks like it is no longer on the menu.  Their tiramisu had a good espresso taste and was moist and flavorful.  All of their desserts include the calorie count now, which I imagine would definitely scare many away. While the food was good for what it was (3 stars range), the service was not that great.  Our waiter was friendly, but he seemed to disappear for long stretches of time.  Getting our dessert menus, putting in our dessert order and getting our check took a lot longer than it should have.  A lot of Yelpers have commented (not necessarily on this place) how they are quite surprised when service is so bad and slow when places are not busy (they fret about how bad the service would be if the place was really busy). However, what I have noticed recently is that several empty places are having slow service.  I think with restaurants being less busy, employees now may have more time to socialize with other employees, which can lead to some slow and inattentive service during non-peak times. I would say most CPKs are 3 stars.  They have a pretty varied menu so there are definitely some lackluster dishes offered at CPKs.  But when I stick with what I know I like there, the food is usually okay and serviceable.  Prices are reasonable too.  The portions are not overly big like many chain places out there, but I actually prefer the smaller and more manageable portions. The food at this CPK was decent and comparable to other CPKs, but the service was not as good.  Since this part of Santa Monica has a lot of interesting and worthwhile non-chain places, CPK would definitely not be my first or even second choice (though CPK is less expensive than those non-chain places).  If you are looking for reasonably priced sit-down food at 3rd Street Promenade, this CPK may be worth a shot.  Hopefully, our slow service was an anomaly. There is a nearby parking structure (a block or so east of CPK) that is free for the first several hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-monica?start=140

Our waiter knew NOTHING. Not only that, but he wouldn't stay around long enough for us to ask all our questions so that we could place an order. Every question, he kept running off and saying he will be right back. He would disappear for minutes at a time. One in our party has a vegan diet. Another one has food allergies. We asked if eggs are used in any bread or pizza dough for the vegan. He said ALL of their dough and pasta contains eggs. How can that be? I asked him to ask the manager. I know eggs are not used in pizza dough and most pasta. He comes back to confirm that YES, ALL THE DOUGH AND PASTA CONTAINS EGGS. At this point, I'm totally confused. Our vegan settled on a salad and because of his lack of knowledge, I'm thinking I need to order a la cart so I can put together an allergy free meal for my kid. I asked him what vegetables they have for side dishes. Instead of answering me, he said, he'll be right back. He throws an incomplete dietary guide on the table for me to look through and takes off. I look at it. It only had calorie counts on the main dishes and not the ingredients or even side dishes. I had enough. It's been well over 15 minutes of back and forth with him and we didn't have any answers to our questions. We literally could not order anything or make any headway. We had no choice but to leave because we could not get serviced. We went to another restaurant a block away and their staff was knowledgeable and attentive. Everyone was able to eat. When I got home, I opened their complete dietary guide online. It states, All pizza dough can be used to make vegan pizza. It even gives examples how. All pasta can be used. It does show that the dough and pasta shares equipment, but it doesn't actually contain the eggs. Additionally any Gluten free dough is certified and vegan so it doesn't share any equipment. Why was this so difficult? It's not everyday we can get our family together to go out, so this really ruined our night. It could have been so simple if this waiter would have been better trained and stuck around to finish our order.  We have been going to this particular restaurant since it opened. It had a rough patch with service, but got it together after the remodel. Until this last time we came. Looks like they are heading back to their old ways. Train your staff better and hire people who want to help and be of service. More and more people have dietary restrictions for one reason or another.

Bread and butter was also surprisingly good too.   Think this is going to be one of our regular dinner spots to mix into our rotation. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-monica?start=20
Eriko P.,"Santa Monica, CA",194,426,2610,5.0,7/17/2016,"It's been awhile since my last review, so I thought I would write one today. We walked inside in between lunch and dinner so it was no problem getting a booth. The interior is revamped, remodeled! It looks clean, industrial, country chic. I ordered my favorite, the Thai Chicken Crunch salad because I love cabbage, crispy wontons and the Thai peanut sauce. My husband ordered the chicken piccata which looked really delicious and he said it was perfect! For dessert we ordered the butter cake with vanilla ice cream! The cake was moist and tasty! Service was efficient, friendly and professional. I like CPK for their consistency, and tasty food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-monica?start=20
Lupe G.,"Santa Monica, CA",13,58,50,1.0,11/24/2015,Portions are really stingy. I don't know why I keep ordering from there. The portions just get smaller and smaller each time. The asparagus and arugula salad was the stingiest. You get a handful of dry arugula and two 1-inch stumps of asparagus. What's going on CPK?  I think I've learned my lesson now. Never again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-monica?start=20
