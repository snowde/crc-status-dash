Brittany D.,"Bradenton, FL",72,76,133,4.0,12/27/2017,"This was our first time at this one. The service was awesome. Shout out to fantastic server Rachel! She was very attentive and personable. She really made the experience fun.  The food was delicious and the prices were fair. The items we chose were shared between my fiance and myself. It was mostly geared towards his taste buds, but was still tasty.  The overall feel is casual upscale, which fits the area pretty well. The location is easy to find and around a bunch of shops and the new UTC mall.  Food was out quickly and still really hot. We will be back. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sarasota-2
Sarah A.,"Sarasota, FL",2,92,98,2.0,11/29/2017,"Tonight we decided to eat here after we met Santa. Our table ordered the avacado egg roll appetizer, bbq chicken pizza, among other things. Everything that we ordered wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't good! Service was okay, although I felt our waiter could have been more attentive with how slow it was. Our bill with a few alcoholic drinks included was over 100$ for 3 adults(my husband and I shared a pizza) and two children( they shared a kids pizza). We will not be back. It wasn't quality food for the high price. THe butter cake was our true motivation for going, and it certainly didn't live up to all of it hype. So many other great places to eat for the money you will spend here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sarasota-2
Frank C.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",0,9,11,4.0,11/17/2017,This is my second time visiting this location. I have enjoyed both experiences.  The CPK does a great job with salads and is always willing to substitute items. Good eats!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sarasota-2
Travis H.,"Sarasota, FL",50,114,355,3.0,2/12/2017,"CPK was one of my all time favorite places to eat back in Honolulu. So you can understand my excitement when I saw the signs being put up during the construction phase which revealed this new CPK location. Well, I finally got to come here for dinner, and I was really disappointed.  We walked in and immediately realized how absurdly cold it was inside so we asked to sit outside instead. No big deal, but the issue was that we sat for over 10 minutes without being approached at our table. I had my CPK app open to my check in code ready to go, but she seemingly ignored it, and I had to remind her at the end of our meal about it. Eventually a waitress came over and said ""I hope you weren't waiting long. It would really help if they told someone they sat people outside."" This for me is off putting. A simple apology would have sufficed as I really don't need to know that we were basically cast aside and forgotten about.  The food was decent. What I've found is that every CPK is different when it comes to the quality of their product. I'd say this one is pretty average. The pizza just didn't taste as fresh and fulfilling as I've come to expect. There was also a weird situation where another server came to apologize for chicken missing on our pizza, but it was in fact not missing. He then gave us an extra plate of chicken (totally fine, good gesture).  At the end of our visit my wife and I walked away pretty bummed that our first experience here was mediocre. There's just too much competition with pizza in the area to be average. Hopefully things will get better with time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sarasota-2
Art C.,"Sarasota, FL",7,522,523,5.0,1/24/2017,"Busy and loud Open for only 2 days, CPK was energetic with a large staff and lots of customers.  There were smiles all around as we arrived and were shown to a seat.  We have visited CPK at the International Plaza in Tampa and looked forward to its arrival in Sarasota. I went with an old favorite, their thin crusted Sicilian pizza.  It looked particularly good as it was placed on our table less than 20 minutes later.  That's when I realized each table had their own ceiling spotlight, and our light made our pizza shine so invitingly it made my mouth water.  Our pizza also tasted particularly good.   Service was very good with a newness of a place just open.  A manager checked with us as we ate to be sure we were happy.  We were.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sarasota-2
Nicole M.,"Orlando, FL",181,56,91,5.0,6/20/2017,"There are pizzas, pastas, and salads! Such wonderful service and good drink selection. The Hawaiian pizza was tasty, and the pineapple definitely topped it off. Our server was very helpful with the menu, as it was our first time. Try the mac n cheese.

D J.,"Chicago, IL",14,325,368,3.0,6/4/2017,"I love California Pizza Kitchen! The food at this locations was consistent with others I've been to; however, the service was not.  William our server was very nice but he was MIA after he took our order until he brought the check. It wasn't his service that was displeasing it was that of other (maybe this guy was a manager....IDK). I didn't get his name only a picture. He walked by as asked how is everything. I replied great, can we please get some extra napkins (I couldn't ask William because he never returned). He walked away can back and literally threw the napkins down on the table and walked away.  While, I'll return for the food (I love their guac); I just hope I never have to encounter the rude guy again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sarasota-2
Sean K.,"Westfield, IN",0,9,,2.0,12/19/2017,"Had a specialty pizza and the BBQ salad, both lacked taste. Service was poor. The ambiance reminded me of chuck-e-cheese. #DateNiteFail",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sarasota-2

Gregg H.,"Bradenton, FL",6,5,,1.0,12/17/2017,"For a chain this location can not compare to the unit in International Mall in Tampa. Salmon was ordered and a thin crust pizza. The salmon was over cooked and had no flavor, the pizza had minimal amount of cheese and sauce. The pizza has an up charge because it's thin crusted, but it should have been less of a charge since it was lacking sauce and cheese compared to a regular pizza. Value for your money, no. Go to an independent parlor",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sarasota-2
Sydney G.,"Sarasota, FL",4,5,,2.0,10/28/2017,"The service was prompt and excellent despite being packed at the time. However, the food is outrageously over priced.It tastes fine, but is definitely not worth the price. Our ""split"" pizza was ridiculous- the pepperoni side partly took over my vegetarian side. Safe yourself the money and just go to one of the other pizza restaurants nearby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sarasota-2
Kelly B.,"Bradenton, FL",0,41,9,4.0,2/26/2017,"Overall, good but not great.  The new California Pizza Kitchen is an addition to a growing (and seemingly non stop) number of restaurants in the University area. There are already a few pizza restaurants in the vicinity as well. The restaurant is decorated in an artsy-industrial style with a cool bar and outdoor area. We decided to try it after so many friends mentioned how good CPK is in Tampa. We were there for lunch today and got draft beers, spinach dip and a BBQ Chicken pizza. I always appreciate restaurants who offer local brews. The dip and pizza were good, but not show stoppers.  The reason for four stars was really due to the wait staff. Our waitress was cordial, but gruff. She would take our orders or stop by the table almost as if she was too busy and would barely make eye contact or smile. We felt like her drive by table. This was a Sunday afternoon and the place was almost empty-no one was rushing. With so many options, especially for pizza, the experience is really foremost set by the staff and this wasn't a stellar first visit for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sarasota-2
Rory D.,"Jacksonville, FL",1450,458,254,4.0,7/8/2017,"California Pizza Kitchen is a step above most ""pizza"" chains, and although there are many delicious & unique pizzas to try, they have much more on their menu. Several fresh salads, pastas, grilled dinners, and not to mention a full bar. This location has a great layout, and you can watch the chefs preparing the pizzas and other dishes in the kitchen. Try one of their 4 interesting soups, or do their 2 in a bowl; 2 soups next to each other in the same bowl. Lunches served with fresh sourdough bread and an herbed oil dipping sauce. My son & I tried their House BBQ Chicken Pizza with Gouda, red onions & cilantro.   also had 4 infusions to try. Happy Hour Mon-Fri from 3-6 PM. Sometimes pizza designed in CA and now served in Florida is a fresh and delicious way to go. PS, our server Hanna rocks! She was attentive, friendly and helpful all lunch and def seemed like a Cali girl. Only drawback was it is a bit pricey. A 6 oz house Cab was almost $9, was fair. A 10"" pizza will run you over $16",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sarasota-2
Frank R.,"Sarasota, FL",7,94,276,4.0,1/27/2017,"I will say the place is nice , menu has  some nice items what we had was very good , place very busy but service was good . Food tasted good and we were pleased the only reason they did nt get 5 stars  is we were disappointed to learn their happy hour will be Mon Tru Thur only . Just about  everyplace in Sarasota has a 5 or 7 day happy hour with a big appetizer choice , not 5 items like their happy hour menu has n not even pizza is offered. They r in the mist of many fine restaurants and. bars I am sure they ll learn soon enough that competition is knocking at their door and that season ends here at Easter time ,then they have to cater to the locals because the city drops 50% and they can't count on limited offerings to the locals",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sarasota-2
Deb E.,"Sarasota, FL",15,7,1,4.0,3/4/2017,"I have been a regular customer of CPK when I lived in Northern California. Since moving to Florida 2 years ago, I did miss CPK. You can imagine how happy I was when they opened up a restaurant in Sarasota!  I went there for dinner tonight with my spouse, and was happy we were seated right away. The waitress , Kelsie, was excellent. She was very attentive and friendly. We ordered our usual California Club Pizza, which was just as tasty as I remembered in California! Our drinks, Blue Moon beer and a margarita came quickly after ordering.  We were in and out in less than an hour on a Saturday night( 6 pm) which we we very happy about, as we had later plans.

Jule H.,"Wilton, CT",0,43,2,4.0,2/23/2017,"BROUGHT BACK MEMORIES OF THE ORIGINAL CPK I USED TO FREQUENT IN CALI I lived in Los Angeles from 1997-2008 and had a CPK in my neighborhood that we used to frequent. When I moved to CT, there weren't any near me, so when I moved to Lakewood Ranch last week and noticed that a CPK had opened near by I was thrilled! When I arrived, the hostess was great and brought me to a table where I met my server, Bree who was terrific! She was friendly, bubbly and enthusiastic and made the entire experience fun. I knew exactly what I missed from the LA location (there were many, many items that I missed) and knew what I wanted to start with...the Tostada Pizza with Lime Chicken...and they did not disappoint. It came out quickly and hot and tasted just as I had remembered...DELISH! The decor was definitely updated from what I recall and the restaurant has lots of windows as well as an outdoor patio. It's light and airy and you can see the kitchen from your table. I cannot wait to bring my husband back when he comes down to join me next month. I'm thinkin'...chopped salad & two soups in a bowl (smashed pea and sedona tortilla).  YAY Sarasota CPK!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sarasota-2
Megan B.,"Bradenton, FL",0,11,4,3.0,2/24/2017,The gluten free pizza is the best I've had. Amazing! It's pricey but worth it.

David S.,"Chicago, IL",86,12,2,2.0,2/3/2017,"It's a normal CPK. The food is what you would expect, however, the service was a disaster. They texted us to tell us our table was ready only to inform us upon arriving at the counter that they only texted us to ""see if we were still in the area"". We then had to wait about another 20 minutes before our table was actually ready. After we were seated the kitchen and bar were very slow and the computer system went down causing our order to be delayed further. Most members of the staff were extremely kind and worked very hard.

Siri G.,"Orlando, FL",0,99,3,2.0,2/28/2017,"Not horrible...but too expensive imo for a chain restaurant. Maybe I am behind me the times but $15 for a salad or sandwich and $8 for a bowl of soup just seems too high for casual dining. Unless you really like the pizza I wouldn't recommend it.

John B.,"Bradenton, FL",0,88,,2.0,4/7/2017,"I had the turkey with brie cheese sandwich. It was nothing special from a taste standpoint. The worst part was when I bite into the sandwich the crust broke into several pieces and I ate the balance of the sandwich with my fingers and no bread. The 1/2 sandwich, small side salad and ice tea was $13.85 before tip. A little expensive for lunch. There were several people in our group and no one was impressed with their meal.

JM T.,"Bradenton, FL",1,12,,5.0,1/26/2017,"We have been CPK fans since the '80s and have been waiting for more than 10 years for a store in Sarasota. We are SO happy! Although the store has only been open for four days, there were no hiccups in service. The staff was upbeat and friendly and very interested in providing good service. Mission accomplished. It goes without saying that CPK has some of the tastiest, most interesting dishes you'll find at any chain restaurant, but I was pleasantly surprised that the food was on point in this brand new store. For those new to CPK, tonight we had the Farmers Market Soup (so rich and creamy), the Moroccan-Spiced Chicken Salad (squash, beets & figs!!!) and the signature BBQ Chicken Pizza (still as good as it was the first time I had it). Fruit flavored iced tea and a nice glass of wine... ahhh!
