Britt C.,"Glendale Heights, IL",312,352,131,3.0,4/5/2015,"Our meal was good - quite pleased with it, however I am still not in a rush to get back or anything.  We just had the small guacamole appetizer, which was good - very small, but to be fair it was very inexpensive.  We then decided when in Rome - and ordered a pizza. Went with the wild mushroom (no truffle oil topping) and I was pretty happy with it. I liked that the crust was light and that they didn't skimp on the mushroom toppings.  We decided that splitting these two items between the two of us was pretty perfect. I'm always looking for that balance of eating enough, but not going over board and feeling too full to do anything the rest of the day.  The service was decent, it was pretty quiet at this location. They kept coming around to check if we had the bill ready when we were sitting chatting (even after we had been told by two separate associates there was no rush mind you!)  which was a little annoying, especially since it wasn't as though there weren't a ton of table open for other customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-schaumburg?start=20
Amanda O.,"Elgin, IL",43,85,210,4.0,3/8/2015,"While my daughter was at the mall shopping with a friend, I decided to get some work done on my laptop. I saw on Yelp that California Pizza Kitchen had free WiFi, so I decided to have dinner there too. I told the hostess that I would be on my laptop and she, thankfully, put me at the last table in the back. I didn't like that it was right next to the kitchen, but I did like that I was away from other people eating. I can't remember my server's name, but she was super friendly and helpful. I had a couple of questions about things on the menu and she was able to answer them all. I usually order the white pizza, but she recommended the wild mushroom pizza. I still like the white pizza more (with bacon), but the mushroom pizza with truffle oil was good too. It never fails, though, that every time I know I'm going to want dessert at a restaurant, my server fails to ask me if I want to order some. She brought my check before asking if I wanted dessert and had to take it away because I ended up ordering the Butter Cake which was amazing.  It was like a cross between a pound cake and a cookie and I loved it with ice cream on top.

Phil P.,"Schaumburg, IL",52,170,,5.0,5/14/2015,"So, after visiting the AT&T store nearby, the wife and I suddenly found ourselves having to kill 2 hours for her phone data transfer to complete.  After a brief visit to Trader Joe's, we decided to settle for dinner at CPK... best decision of the day!  Upon entering, we noticed the renovations in process.  But it was still fairly busy for a Thursday night, which is always a good sign.  We got seated immediately and were greeted by John, or server for the evening.  Great guy, a ball of positive energy!  We ordered the tostada pizza and my favorite, the tequila lime chicken fettuccine with extra sauce.  We also ordered some of their habanero salsa on the side.  When the pizza arrived, the wife noticed the crust was different than in the past.  John told us that they changed the crust on the tostada pizza, but he gladly offered to make a new pizza on the crust we favored... awesome!   Once the revised pizza arrived, we met the manager, who ensured we were happy with our meal.  This location, despite being a chain, personified exemplary customer service.  What makes it even better, is their food is deeelish!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-schaumburg?start=20

Amber S.,"Lincoln Park, Chicago, IL",17,11,1,1.0,9/4/2015,"Worst service ever by the ""greeter.""  Just came back an hour ago. We came as a party of 11 to celebrate my brother's birthday. As we walked in this short haired blonde woman who was supposed to be the greeter completely ignored us. We approached her to tell her we were here as a party of 11 and she was overall indifferent and seemed to have some complexities and a power struggle because she wanted to seat us at separate tables and refused to push them in together. She didn't e plain why they couldn't be pushed together and claimed that a larger area would be an hour late---keep in mind we were the only ones waiting and this was at 8:30 and the restaurant was not ridiculously busy at all for a Friday night. She then didn't even escort us to the table...she basically just pointed the table out to us. Completely rude and unacceptable. Our server was very kind and another server or manager saw what was going on and he offered to push the two tables together. The food was just fine and very standard for what cpk is. The manager was making rounds to ask everyone how they were enjoying the food and how everything was going. He seemed to completely ignore our table---the huge table of 11. Don't know how he can miss us but he somehow totally did... We tipped very generously as our server was kind. Overall though---I was disgusted by the rude demeanor of the manager and the ""greeter.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-schaumburg?start=20

Bob R.,"Palatine, IL",223,623,715,3.0,7/21/2013,"Since for medical reasons I eact have anything with milk products, this was a strange choice for lunch. My daughter just finished her first 1/2 marathon and this is where she wanted to go, so we went. Going to any pizza place and ordering a pizza without cheese is always a fun experience. You sort of feel like everyone in the restaurant turns and looks at you when you order. But, none the less, I ordered their ""Works"" pizza with no cheese. The service was very slow. We were the first to arrive at the restaurant at 11AM on a Sunday, and five tables received their meals before we did. The server was pleasant enough, but I have no idea why it took so long. Fortunately, their beverage service is free flowing. Right now they serve Pepsi products but the server made a strong point that they were changing to Coke products in two weeks. So, the food experience was not great, but the overall experience was good as we thrilled in our daughter's 1/2 marathon success.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-schaumburg?start=20

Zeshan S.,"Schaumburg, IL",29,3,,1.0,8/14/2016,"I would give this place 0 stars if Yelp let me. I have never had a worst experience in life!  My wife and I happened to be in Schaumburg with our newborn for a day of shopping and decided to grab a quick bite. Well that didn't happen... We were greeted and seated promptly by the host but that was the end of the polite service.  We sat for 15 minutes and figured out what we wanted to eat. In that entire time. Not a single person ever made their way to our table. Not to be greeted, not to be asked for drinks, not to be asked to place starters..... Nothing.  Mind you, it was not busy at all and there were plenty of staff on hand. I don't think a single member of their staff even made eye contact with us. I kept looking around and trying to draw someone's attention but it never happened.  A waitress finally approached us or so we thought, NOPE, she went past us and to the table on our side to see what her tip was. she then walked away. Shortly after she approached us again but yet again she walked passed us to the same table and started to clean up. It was clear she had no intention of acknowledging us.  When I finally decided to get up and leave, my wife decided to tell the waitress why we were leaving. The waitress just looked at us with disgust and went about her way. Never even uttering a word, let alone an apology but Wait it gets better.  The hostess that had sat us and was eating her meal not even 5 feet away.... Told us to have a great day on the way out. She didn't even recall that we were the only people she had greeted in the last 15 minutes. On my drive out of the place I decided to call the manager to let him know how horrible we felt and how neglected we were. He apologized and then said he can offer me coupons if wanted to try again. I said no thank you and he said sorry and hang up. It's no wonder the service here is so bad. This guy could care less that we called and had no regard for our time or feelings. Thanks Brian!!!  I don't ever Yelp and I made an account just to write a review... Food for thought....but never again CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-schaumburg?start=20
Azhar S.,"Bartlett, IL",30,90,85,2.0,7/27/2015,"Been here twice and haven't been a huge fan of this place.  In my opinion, it's over priced and the quality lacks.  They have a decent selection.   I ordered a chicken pizza and the pizza crust was so thin and small I felt like I barely ate anything when I left and the bill was pretty hefty for very little food.  Surprisingly, the place is packed but I'm just not a fan.

Nikki S.,"Chicago, IL",31,208,48,2.0,8/6/2013,"I had planned a small baby shower for a friend of mine and had called over to CPK on a Tuesday for a Saturday reservation. The gentleman that answered the phone informed me they only do same day reservations. I asked if they would be able to accommodate a group of 7 for a small baby shower and that is when the gentleman told me of their party room. He told me he would be putting me down for the party room for that Saturday. I was grateful and happy - until I arrived at the restaurant that Saturday. I walked in the restaurant early to start my small decorating process for their party room. I told the hostess who I was and reservation info. She gave me the ""oh crap"" face and got the manager. The ""manager"" first said he didn't have staff for their party room?!?! and then told me he had no information on my event?!? I explained as calmly as I could holding a 20 pound box of baby decorations what the gentleman told me on the phone. The manager then led me back to their ""room"" and said this isn't how they normally do things yada yada. All of the sudden Mr. Manager comes back with a waiter - so he lied about the no staff. I am giving them 2 stars because the food was excellent, our waiter was fantastic, and the mom-to-be had a great time.

Melissa H.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",151,65,119,3.0,12/20/2014,"We met up with some friends here last night for dinner. Our server named Justin was great. He was patient in waiting for us to order and catching up with our friends. He was also very entertaining and provided great customer service  I'm not completely sure of what our friends ordered but for appetizers we split fried mac and cheese and the avocado egg rolls. Both were brought to us warm, fresh, and crispy. My husband ordered their Wild mushroom pizza and added bacon. I ordered their quinoa arugula salad and added chicken. I am obsessed with this salad at CPK and it's the only thing I order from there. To be honest, we were disappointed in our entrees. We frequently go to the CPK closer to our home at Deer Park. The pizza my husband said wasn't nearly as good as Deer Park's CPK and the salad portion seemed smaller then the Deer Park location. Overall we had great customer service and a hilarious waiter that we would come back for as well as the appetizers/drinks, but if we want to have their main entrees we're probably going to stick to their Deer Park location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-schaumburg?start=20
Jen J.,"Chicago, IL",1154,398,1729,2.0,3/12/2013,"I've eaten here before several times back when I was in high school. The items that I remember trying are the fettucini, mac & cheese, garlic chicken pizza, thai pizza, thai salad, bbq pizza. I remember that they were good, but not great. That was years ago though. Today, we had their chicken & shrimp lettuce wraps ($12.75) and works thin crust pizza ($15.25).  Lettuce wraps - 2.5 stars. Good, but not worth $13 Works pizza - 1 star at that price. The crust was crisp on the edges (good), floppy elsewhere. It reminded me of a non-toasted tortilla, in a bad way. Cheese and sauce were a huge letdown. Flavorless cheese and not enough sauce! I only ate a few bites of my slice. The max I would pay is $10, but even then, it'd rate lower than Home Run Inn's frozen pizza that I'd get for $6. Easily can make a better pizza. Can probably buy a better frozen pizza too, which shouldn't be the case for a restaurant that has the word 'pizza' in its name lol.

Nicholas S.,"Elk Grove Village, IL",35,18,1,5.0,11/12/2013,"I'm very grateful for this place. I came for a quick lunch bite on Veteran's day. I did eight years in the Navy, and after showing my ID they said go ahead and pick anything you want on the left side of the menu - PIZZA DISHES! It's not like they had a special limited menu to pick four items from. NO. They happily repeated, ""Any meal you want, left side, go ahead, its all free."" I was so impressed!  Now the drink I had to cover. No problem. As I waited for the pizza to finish and reminisce with another veteran I happen to serve with in '06, they refilled my drink with ease until I took off with my pizza, they made sure my drink was full. They thanked me and gave me a generous meal. Would have paid $15.  Never had I been taken care of so well for Veteran's day. Of all the different chain restaurant/places I've been to in the past few years, this place is the best!

In any case, they don't make the amazing Tostada pizza anymore.  Super bummer. The fried macaroni and cheese was great, the bang bang shrimp was just OK (Bonefish grill is a million times better!) and our pizzas were good.  You know, once they were corrected.  I got the pizza with about a million different meats on it, and it was awesome, and my friend got the Hawaiian chicken pizza which was delicious as well.   We didn't save enough room for dessert, but they did look awesome.  So if I ever go back, I shall order that first!! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-schaumburg?start=60

Fred E.,"Winter Garden, FL",18,186,126,4.0,8/20/2014,"Years ago when I discovered CPK, they had a Peking Duck pizza which I fell in love with. I think it was especially because of the tang of the hoisin sauce. I tried the Thai chicken pizza and it didn't quite have the same kick. The bean sprouts and carrots were excellent - clean and crunchy. I would have liked the thin crust to have been a bit crisper. The strawberry and watermelon fields salad was great - the dressing blending in with the fruit instead of overwhelming it. I would have liked to have seen the waiter a bit more - I didn't get a refill of water until I was almost done with my meal although he was pleasant when he did come by. An extra napkin or two when the meal was served would have been nice since pizza is a finger food. Great atmosphere and enjoyed the background music too. The hostess was very gracious in assisting me with seating. For a ""pizza"" place, a little on the pricey side but I guess the uniqueness and quality comes with a bit of a premium - the salad (half portion) and pizza (I did order whole grain and thin crust which was extra) and no drinks came up to $32 with tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-schaumburg?start=60

We haven't been to CPK in a while and it seemed like it would be a nice change of pace from the typical places we go. Gotta say, they've upped their game since the last time I was there. We split a nice white corn guacamole appetizer and a really tasty roasted artichoke and spinach pizza.   Some interesting and unique food, done well.

Carrie C.,"Draper, UT",8,205,3,2.0,1/6/2010,"I left California Pizza Kitchen thinking...I'll just stick with the frozen CPK pizzas.  The server kept trying to talk us into multiple appetizers and said the pizzas were too much for one person.  Not sure if they were just telling servers to push apps or what.   There were only two of us, so we had no need for multiple appetizers.  In addition to the one app,  we shared a goat cheese/pepper pizza which ended up being really good and the perfect portion size for two people.  It wasn't very warm though... We also got the dumplings which weren't cooked all the way and tasted really bland til you dipped them in the sauce that comes with it.  The glasses and plates all seemed a bit greasy like they weren't washed very well....this alone grosses me out.  We sat down about 15 minutes before the two tables next to us and they were finishing their pizzas by the time we got ours.  And both of those tables had apps too...but a different server.   So...""meh, I've experienced better"" is what I'm sticking to.  I have no interest in going back and will just wait for the next time I'm in CA to have these types of pizzas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-schaumburg?start=60

While this is clearly not a good thing, the worst thing about this, is that I alerted the corporate office, and NOTHING was done by the company.  I felt this was important for the company to know, for everyone's sake (Safety).  Corporate did take my call, and supposedly alerted the store in Schaumburg.  I was told by the corporate office that I would hear back ""shortly"" from the store itself.   I have not heard back from the Schaumburg store, and it's been nearly a month.  I wrote back to corporate, just to let them know that Schaumburg never bothered to deal with this matter, and I haven't even heard back from them.   While I will miss eating at CPK, since the company does not handle matters properly, we will no longer eat at any CPK.  We just have too many options.  Lettuce Entertain You restaurants would have never handled (or not at all!) a situation like this.  We are willing to pay the money to eat at quality, better-run restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-schaumburg?start=60

You can always tell when corporate has started dictating service standards because they all sound the same and you really don't get personalities anymore. I can't imagine they have the kind of fun working here now as when they first opened stores almost 30 years ago. The food here is always good even though they tend to add/remove dishes alot. They've lost some good dishes - Cajun Pizza, Black Bean Angel Hair. My biggest problem with CPK now is I no longer can afford to eat here as often as I'd like. I used to go once a week but now I just go every few months. Their prices are crazy - $10 for a half salad?? Pasta dishes for $13+. Every thing has gone through the roof. Those tiny little flatbread things are like $5 or $6. Every time owner ship changes the prices go up to feed a new crop of overpaid execs I guess. Started with the founders Rick and Larry and it was a little high, but I didn't see a price hike for years. And then Pepsico got involved, then sold it back to Rick and Larry, and now its been sold a time or two to some restaurant corps.

Usually at EVERY cpk you get the sourdough bread with some packets for solid cement frozen butter packets.. This place actually had room temp packets.

My boyfriend lived in Santa Cruz, CA for many years. He knows California cuisine. We also dine out a lot (not always worthy of a yelp mention) so we know the value of a meal. You don't tell the guy the chicken is not a full breast but merely chicken strips in a sandwich! Then add insult to injury by not offering a complimentary side dish when he decides to order the Chicken Piccata. I'm not saying he was expecting compensation. Most places you order an entree, it includes a side dish.  Here, you get a soup or salad included with a sandwich but you get nothing for ordering an entree like the Chicken Piccata that is comparable in price.

Weird? Everybody must have thought the same thing because they were all wearing their coats while eating.  That's a big No No in any establishment, being cold while eating food. I even had hot tea to keep warm.  Food: The white bean minestrone soup was pretty good, nice flavor and a hint of tanginess. I also got the white pizza and the garlic chicken pizza. Initially, we have high hopes for this place. Rejoicing in the memory of how good the pizza tasted a couple of years ago.  For $12 a pizza, it must taste good right? Wrong!!!  The pizza came out unordinary, in a regular dish and it looked unappealing altogether. Like someone else said in their review, seems like reheated frozen pizza.  In terms of taste, it was bland and uneatable. After 2 slices I felt rather nauseous and I had to force myself to eat some of it because I'm going to pay for it. Man, it was horrible. I usually don't give bad reviews but this really deserved it.

He was warm and friendly and recommended the spinach dip as a good appetizer for vegetarians (one of us was vegetarian). We were pleased with his service. He gave us lots of bread (the bread is the best part of this place!) when we asked. Chris seemed nice for a Jewish man, which I appreciated. The food was good, and I think I will return. I will ask for Chris. My friend (the vegetarian) complained that there was too much ice in her water and didn't know there was chicken in the barbecue salad but other than that we were pleased with the service and quality of the food.

The on call manager Bruce Marvin needs to be re-educated in customer service. We have been going to this location for over 5 years, & almost every time my wife orders the fish tacos with a simple substitution of their salsa & chips for a side Caesar salad at no extra charge. Bruce is under the impression that this dish priced $10.75 should have a $2 up charge for the salad, when other sandwich dishes offer the salad as a side item already. He stated bluntly & rudely that the up charge had something to do with their price point cost difference. I know from my experience that the salad's ingredients are cheaper than the salsa and chips, when purchased in bulk from the supplier.  I have ample experience as a restaurant manager from my days at Denny's, obviously ""the customer is always right,"" does not apply for this restaurant. I refuse to pay their stupid up charge. We simply got up and left. I hope you get retrained or let go Bruce. I put in a call to your corporate office, and will continue to call until something is done to fix this situation.

Fish tacos - i am a fish taco feen and unfortunately both my favorite locations to get fish tacos are no longer serving it. This was the worst of the items we ordered.

And there wasn't enough sauce. I am not sure if I will come back to this place since I live so far.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-schaumburg?start=100
The C.,"Chicago, IL",3,26,,4.0,4/11/2010,"My sister was in town, so we decided to go out for my parent's 34th anniversary. Sister doesn't have a CPK in her nearby area in Nebraska, so she was dying to have the BLT Pizza. We started with a round of drinks; sister went with a diet coke, but my dad and I both had a pina colada--dad got the original, I got a strawberry colada. Overall, the strawberry colada was a bit unusual--I thought it would completely be strawberry, but instead it had remnants of strawberry pieces and flavoring. Not too sure what to think. Overall, it was a good drink, but the price was a bit steep too.  In addition to the BLT pizza my sister ordered, I tried their pesto chicken and onion pizza, my mom had the tostada pizza, and my dad had the japanese eggplant pizza.  My pizza was a new addition to their menu, and although I enjoyed it in the beginning, there was way too much pesto in it!!!! I only finished half of the pizza. I also had a couple of slices of the tostada pizza, and it was AMAZING. Really enjoyed it as did my mom. I didn't touch the Japanese Egglplant pizza because I am not really a fan of the broccoli on the pizza. My sister is flying back to Omaha tomorrow, and I am probably going to have her leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  Oh, I forgot about the appetizer that we had!!! It took a while to bring out, because they had to make it from scratch. It was a small platter of guacomele with chips--the guacomele had black beans, corn, and something I've never had before but was barely tasteable--jicama!  The service was pretty good, so I left a generous tip. Overall, we'll definitely be back; we are frequent visitors of CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-schaumburg?start=100
Victoria B.,"Des Plaines, IL",23,109,51,4.0,8/11/2008,"I never thought of eating at California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) but I was talked into it by the sister-in-law (Stacy).  I figured if she likes it, it couldn't be bad since she's the finicky eater. I ordered the Goat Cheese with Roasted Peppers.  It's made with a mild goat cheese, roasted red & yellow peppers, grilled Japanese eggplant, Mozzarella cheese, carmelized onions, Italian parsley and tomato sauce.  The crust was very thin but very crispy and tasty.  Stacy had the Original Barbecue Chicken Pizza made with barbecue sauce, smoked Gouda and Mozzarella cheeses, BBQ Chicken, sliced red onions and cilantro.  Who would have thought that a pizza made with BBQ sauce would have tasted so good, I was truly impressed.  I was a bit stuffed from my meal or else I would have ordered dessert.  The Chocolate Soufflé Cake was looking good but I had to say no.  Until next time my love. CPK also has other items on the menu like pastas, salads, soups, and sandwiches but I couldn't bring myself to order anything but pizza on my first visit.  I figured I could get something else next time like the Kung Pao Spaghetti or the BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad.  I also noticed that they had a kids menu for those under 10.  It had five different varieties of pizza, four pasta dishes, mac n' cheese, a chicken dish and a salad topped with with Cheddar Goldfish.  I was actually very pleased with my experience at CPK.  I was even more thrilled that they carried Pepsi products with complimentary refills.  It's the little things in life that make me the happiest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-schaumburg?start=100
Tracy K.,"Chicago, IL",115,487,51,3.0,4/21/2008,"I think CPK is kind of overrated and overpriced, but because they offer items I can't get anywhere else, I do find myself coming here from time to time to bring lunch back to the office.   Each time I have been in, it has been uncomfortably hot, and as a person who likes it warm, that's saying something.   They do get bonus points for understanding a substitution (keep your chicken, gimme avocado instead.. WITHOUT charging me extra for it, kthx).  Good for lunch when you need a break from everything else around here, but not something I hit up every week.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-schaumburg?start=100
