J S.,"Garden Grove, CA",1,65,13,5.0,12/25/2017,"Had the best server on our trip here. I believe his name was Ben. He was So welcoming, and hospitable. Had pizza and salad. The original chicken bbq and asada pizza. Both good, the asada was actually really good, my first time trying it. We also tried the assorted spring rolls. Very good. Tried the spinach dip, i wasn't a,fan. Tasted frozen kind u heat up.  Though full from dinner, At suggestion of server we tried the warm butter cake! Oh yes plz, was delicious! It's not the lighter texture of ur standard yellow cake, it's more dense, buttery, crunchy cane sugar ( lightly), and topped w vanilla ice cream, running down the sides of the,warm cake. We ordered 1 cake and 3 spoons. It was enough to leave our palettes wanting another bite, without going, oh why did I eat all that. I say next time, ill be back for cake n glass of wine, skip right past dinner! Lol, Yum.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seal-beach
Mike S.,"Seal Beach, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/23/2017,"This location's catering business is unethical, dishonest and low class. We ordered several items for Thanksgiving, 2 weeks in advance, prepaid with a credit card. 30 minutes before pick up they called and said ""sorry"" we sold your food to someone else. We had to scramble to Ralph's to get what we needed. This location is run by incompetent people.

Mitchell Q.,"Anaheim, CA",0,10,3,4.0,1/13/2018,"Greetings! Me, my brothers, and my girlfriend were served by Tara at first then Eric. Eric is a phenomenal server, he is the guy who is down to Earth, friendly, energetic, and offers great service. I wasn't too hungry so I just ordered a small dish of Mac and Cheese and a brownie, with my girlfriend ordering a pie, and my brothers ordering their respective pizzas. The reason for four stars is although our server was great (you just don't see guys like this anymore we have to almost beg servers to come back) our food was at best OK, although he had the Mac and cheese remade I still felt a little bit better quality food could have been offered for my girl friend's pie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seal-beach
Aarti K.,"Denver, CO",219,49,148,4.0,8/11/2017,"For the most part, the food is what you would expect - flavorful, but not necessarily extraordinary. Having said that, I would recommend the Spicy Buffalo Cauliflower, which had the perfect amount of heat. I also enjoyed the Chicken Milanese - the panko-crusted chicken was crispy, the diced tomatoes and arugula added some freshness, and the cheese gave the dish a good flavor. I'm not a big fan of their (non-alcoholic) drinks, which were overly sweet. I got the strawberry mango cooler, which was just sugary strawberry soda - I couldn't taste the mango, ginger, or guava that was mentioned in the description. The main reason I liked this CPK location was the service. We went for dinner at a busy time, and were seated within 10 minutes. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly.

This was before we had been introduced to a waiter or waitress. A very polite man came and assisted us in selecting any location. We were abruptly stopped by Kelsey, Cali Pizza's official guard dog. She stated verbatim, ""NO, NO, NO, these tables are RESERVED!!"" We responded, ""Ok we can choose another- Kelsey: And it looks like there aren't any clean tables, so...(while shrugging shoulders) After we were seated we were not greeted by anybody for 5 minutes.

Correen B.,"Garden Grove, CA",388,534,305,2.0,5/1/2017,"More like 2.5 stars.  We had avocado egg rolls, Italian chopped salad, and the chicken club pizza.  The egg rolls are definitely mushy.  Just not a fan.  The salad was the high point of the meal for sure.  We took CPK's advice from the menu and went with the whole wheat crust.  We found it to be very chewy and not in a good way.  The ticket time was way too long, and the server was inattentive.  Here is a great example of this:  I ordered their ""ultimate"" Bloody Mary. It was truly the worst drink that I've ever had. Bland, watery, and not a trace of Vodka at all.  No olives or celery, but garnished with two pieces of rock hard dried out cheese and a pepperoni slice.  It went virtually untouched.  The server never even questioned this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seal-beach
Sandra L.,"Lakewood, CA",875,112,1061,2.0,9/10/2016,"What can I say? I was expecting a little more, not anything gourmet or fancy, but a little more...  Unfortunately, CPK did not meet my expectations. We ordered the Mac n Cheese fried bites which is on the small plates portion of the menu. Basically, they take the kid's Mac n Cheese noodles, flavorless, ball it up, dip it in batter, and fry it. It was sad, flavorless (not even a pinch of salt), and super dry. I almost feel like I am being unfair since I have had the Cheesecake Factory fried Mac n Cheese bites and it is no where near comparable (you gotta go try them, if you haven't...).  Then we had the Spicy Southwest Chicken Pizza. It was just ok. It definitely had all the flavors of a spicy chicken burrito, except it was on a pizza. Again, it wasn't bad, but just ok.  Our server, Sasha, was friendly and attended to our needs. Sorry my fellow yelpers, I won't be rushing back to CPK anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seal-beach
Joyce A.,"Cerritos, CA",360,683,420,3.0,3/1/2017,"This place is my friend's frequent go-to, so she brought me here for lunch . Except, no lunch specials because it was a Saturday. We were seated quite quickly, and opted for a booth. I have to say, although I am petite , that booth was waaaaay lower than I expected, my chin was practically on level with the table.  Not sure if it's the upholstery flattened out over time or actually built this way. I know it says pizza in the name, but of course there is more on the menu. I got the split pea barley soup (full serving), and that was quite good. I know it was probably over the top with sodium because my feet swelled up soon after. (haha)   We also got the Thai Crunch Salad (half-sized) to share. My friend forgot to ask no peanuts though. (no worries, she is NOT allergic, just doesn't like them). (Chopped romaine, crunchy fried rice stick noodles, grilled chicken and a midly spicy sweet-tangy dressing) That was tasty but oddly not satisfying.  Service was okay but I balked at leaving a 20% tip (my friend was more generous). We needed to flag down our server a few times for drink refills and more bread.

Pear gorgonzola pizza, Thai chicken spring rolls with peanut sauce, and a sausage pepperoni & mushroom mini pizza with Mediterranean salad were our orders. Wow. Every meal was reasonably priced, delicious, and we got free bread with olive oil and herbs to munch on while we waited. Our server was really nice but drink refills would have been appreciated. All in all, CPK has come back to what made us come back again and again. Good food at a good price. Noise level is high. Service could be better.

Nor were we asked if we would like a kids menu. The table had spilled water on it left from the previous guest, and two sets of silverware. We had to ask for more. I guess our server expected us to share forks. The crawfish in my wife's jambalaya was tough. My daughters potato soup was bland and I can't put my finger on it but my Sicilian pizza was just off.

Susan L.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,31,,2.0,2/4/2017,"I'm not crazy about CPK, but my son wanted a non-Pizza Hut pizza (who can blame him?) and my hubby likes CPK's chicken piccata, so I called in to use their curbside service. Handy!  The girl who took my order was efficient and polite, and told me the order'd be ready in 30 minutes.  Son and I arrived about 10 minutes early, but, per instruction, I gave them a call anyway to let them know I was there.  About 30 seconds later, Noah came out to get my payment [just for the record: damn, it was pricey: the bill was more than $50 for two orders of chicken piccata and a one-person-pizza], and, in another 30 seconds, he reappeared with my food and my charge-slip to sign. There it was: that TIP line.  Now, I'm a generous tipper (usually 20% in restaurants; even the pizza delivery guy gets $5 above the additional ""service fee"" from me), but I rarely--if ever--tip on takeout.   But, I rationalized, the guy brought it to my car; that's ""service"", I guess...but what was it worth?  Stupid Me decided to ask.  ""So, how much do people usually tip for curbside service?"" There was a pause, and I could see the wheels turning in Noah's head.  You could tell he was a nice kid, but I'd left that door wide open, and he's apparently easily tempted. He went for it. ""Oh, 20%, that's too much,"" he said with a laugh, buying more time.  ""Usually, more, um, like, um, (pause)...$5...or $7 (pause)...or $10...something like that.""  He blinked at me expectantly, innocently, waiting to see if I'd fallen for it.   I didn't.  ""Yeah, nice try,"" I said. ""How about $3.00?""  I filled out the slip, signed it, and handed it back.   On the drive home, my kid and I laughed about Noah's ham-fisted attempt at robbing me blind.  My kid said that he wouldn't have given him anything, on principle; I argued that the food was walked out to the car.  ""Wow,"" my son said, ""He walked a whole 30 feet.  You tip at drive-throughs, too?""  (He knows I don't.) By the time we got home, we decided that, though you can't really blame a guy for trying, you CAN write a nasty YELP review and tell everyone about it.   BTW: the food was adequate (if expensive) as CPK's food generally is.  We'll probably go back, but the curbside kid gets a buck next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seal-beach

The food is good and the selection is great - there's always something of interest.  I miss their Bang Bang Shrimp form a few years ago!  Their seasonal strawberry shortcake is very good.   CPK has recently upgraded their menu - I love their Halibut.

Lily is the STAR of California Pizza Kitchen - statewide (I've been to enough to make that decision. LOL). I ordered the Pesto Cream Penne with a strawberry/raspberry lemonade (no ice, of course). It was DELICIOUS. The perfect amount of sauce and the drinks were good too. This also contributed to the 5 stars rating. I also had a couple of expired coupons (which the manager HONORED for us). So nice and another reason why I give 5 stars. Between two adults and a toddler the bill, minus the honored coupons, was $26.46.

There were also inexplicably no poblano peppers on the pizza.  BLT pizza: it came with a side of mayonnaise instead of ranch dressing. Who spreads mayo ON A PIZZA?

Jennifer D.,"Los Alamitos, CA",2,9,9,1.0,5/20/2017,"Tonight's visit to California Pizza Kitchen was extremely disappointing. We walked into the restaurant and asked to sit on the Patio. The restaurant was not busy and we sat down right away. On the patio the tables were messy and looked like the tables had not been wiped down. 2 tables were full of dishes that had not been bussed yet. Our waitress seemed distracted. I watched other patrons at the tables go and get water for themselves because our waitress would forget to take care of their request. Each time the server brought out food to the surrounding tables she was apologizing for something. Our food was decent. I had the Italian chopped salad half size, my mom had the zucchini, fettuccine shrimp dish, one daughter had the kids macaroni cheese and my other daughter had the Bahn mi bowl which is new on the menu. Not once were we asked if the food was okay or would like a drink refill. We had to ask for place settings as well. I would understand if this restaurant was slammed but they were not busy. During the middle of our meal I finally saw one guy bus a table. Another party of 7 came to sit on the patio and this party individuals were the ones that set up the table. The host that brought them out did not assist. It was time for our bill and my mom picked up the tab. She gave our waitress her credit card. We sat for 10 minutes waiting for her to run the card. She came outside to service her other tables and we asked her about the card and she realized she never ran the card. We waited some more. At this point I went inside to speak with the manager on duty. I told him everything that was going on and all he said was I'm sorry. He didn't offer to compensate anything off the bill. He just simply said thanks for letting me know. I stated to the manager that I frequent their downtown Long Beach location near my office and have had much better service and at that location the manager takes complaints seriously. I hope this location improves on its customer service since I live in the area and do enjoy the brand restaurant. Good customer service starts with good management and came been seen on the floor with staff.

You can't get great service everywhere nowadays so it was definitely nice to have a nice dinner with friendly service. We were seated in less than ten minutes during dinner time so we were happy about that. I tried the appleberry sangria and it was SO good!! Not just a girly drink because my male friend tried it too and he loved it lol. The apples and berries inside the drink tasted fresh so that was a big plus. Their baked potato soup and tortilla soup were both really good I highly recommend. Our server came around with refills every time we were low on water and got our order out pretty fast.

Chani B.,"Long Beach, CA",4,4,10,2.0,8/1/2014,"Updated review (8/29/2014):   It took three weeks for me to hear anything back from CPK management in regards to this ""incident"". Thanks to the response from April (RM I presume) and the clear up of facts, the man who claimed to be the GM Darren, in fact was NOT the GM Darren, but another manager named Tony. Darren, I apologize. You're off the hook, but you should remove worthless managers from your staff. Leadership comes from the top and if not removed will cause the staff to act outside of company protocol. They will cause your business to lose money and that's what matters. The bottom line. I still will probably not ever visit this CPK again. I haven't actually gone to a CPK since the ""incident"" and it will be a long while until I step foot into another CPK establishment. But thank you April and Darren for setting the facts straight.  Prior review (8/1/2014): **DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AT THIS PLACE!! LAKEWOOD CPK IS EXCELLENT. TINA IS THE BEST GM ANYWHERE! I go to CPK a lot.. and when I say a lot, I mean like every week at least twice. This is the 2nd time this specific CPK has not only fucked up my order, the asshole old man of a GM Darren, had the audacity to act as if I fucked up my order. No, YOUR COOKS fucked up my order. How hard is it to swap out to thin spaghetti and cook a crust thoroughly, especially when it was told to be well done. I will not come back to this place EVER. 40$ for 2 dishes, no drinks, and bullshit customer service is not worth it.     Their server (can't remember her name) was awesome.

Chris D.,"Garden Grove, CA",509,896,5326,3.0,12/12/2010,"I like California Pizza Kitchen. It's not the best tasting pizza around but it certainly isn't the worst. I like the many unique combination of flavors they have for their pizzas such as buffalo chicken, carne asada, Thai, Jamaican Jerk, and many others. I don't eat here very often but a $25 gift card brought me in today.  Normally I get the Sicilian pizza which is my favorite one but decided to be different. I ordered the ""Four Seasons"" pizza which is ""imported Italian"" tomatoes, oven-roasted artichoke hearts, salami, mushrooms, onions, and big blobs of fresh mozzarella. All of this was sprinkled with fresh herbs, parmesan cheese, and I added chili flakes. It was a very nice pizza. I didn't realize there wasn't any pizza sauce on it which was a bit disappointed but I think this was done so you can taste all the different ingredients. It was simple yet tasty. I'm not sure what it has to do with the seasons but it made for a good lunch on this 88 degree December day!  Donna had the White Pizza which is mozzarella, fontina, riccota, pecorino romano cheeses with fresh spinach, garlic, and apple wood smoked bacon for $1.50 more. If you're going to charge for bacon then at least add more than a few sprinkles. Donna liked it but I would of been pissed by the scarce amount. We swapped a slice to taste each others pizza. To me this white pizza tasted like shit. It has the texture of mashed potatoes and with all these different cheeses you'd think I'd taste some flavor. Barf inducing snooze fest. For some reason my wife enjoyed it.... glad I didn't order it.  Three stars is a good rating for this place since it's hit or miss. The Sicilian pizza for example kicks ass yet the white pizza tastes like ass.... so it's a Russian Roulette type of menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seal-beach?start=60

For a chain, CPK has always exceeded my expectations of freshness & food preparation. Always super clean, well-managed, and delicious. Today the boyfriend and I ordered the avocado club egg rolls & a BBQ chicken pizza to share. Normally we would make it to a Butter Cake but we were stuffed. That butter cake is like cuh-raaaack on a plate (not that I've ever tried crack before.) Our server Martin was great.. Prompt, extremely friendly, great recommendations without being pushy or a stereotypical ""up seller"" type server. Never had to ask for a refill-- he anticipated every need.

Adam N.,"Seal Beach, CA",332,202,94,2.0,3/10/2015,"Just a big ol' ""meh"". Pizza was over cooked and under sauced. The iced tea was so warm, it sat watered down in my glass almost instantly. That, or there wasn't enough ice... The only thing worth talking about was the pear salad, which was nice, but it was so drowned in dressing there were few other flavors to even experience. Why these places are so popular is beyond me. I guess there is a need for mediocre food at an unreasonable price. Though the company was fantastic, it could barely mask the atrocity that was this meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seal-beach?start=80
Stacy E.,"Buena Park, CA",101,25,4,1.0,12/31/2014,"Well this is my first one star review on Yelp for anything and I'm not sure if it's a great idea to write a review as soon as I walk through my door as I'm very upset at how we were treated at this CPK.  I consider myself a regular to all CPKs and usually receive top notch service.  It's New Year's Eve and my kids and I were driving around looking for a place to eat and saw CPK was open.  When we walked in the hostess greeted us, but didn't mention the restaurant was closing soon.  Let me say if I had any indication the restaurant would be closing I would have turned around and gone somewhere else with no complaints.  We've all had jobs in our past where we want to do the eyeroll when a customer comes in before closing.  I get that, but don't punish a customer for just showing up without any warning.   Jose our waiter shows up...asks for our drink order (not too friendly) and brings our drinks.  I ask for bread which never showed up.  He comes back and advises the kitchen closes in 10 minutes so we quickly place our order.  I had explained we were waiting for my boyfriend to join us but ordered for the whole party right away. Still no bread.  Get up and walk to Jose and ask for bread.  No apology...brings it.  Food arrives we start eating and the manager walks over.  I'm thinking he's going to say how is the food and the typical greeting, but no.  He says we've locked the doors and your friend will need to show ID for safety purposes.  I stated I can clearly see the door (glass panels) and I'll see when he arrives.  It was very obvious the manager wanted us to leave as soon as possible.  I get it!  I tell my kids I'll just ask for the check and get to-go boxes and tell my boyfriend not to come.  I can't make eye contact with the manager or waiter who is totally MIA doing sidework or something.  People, I just want to leave and get out as I know we are not wanted!  crickets! crickets!  finally a random waitress walks by and I ask for the check and boxes.  She was a delight with a bright smile and geniune kind attitude.  Why couldn't she be our waittress? Here's the funny part.  Jose comes over hands us the check and has the nerve to say,"" here you go, please take your time.""  I literally laughed and said really, take your time, that's funny.   I don't think I've ever felt that unwelcome.  All they had to say was we are closing soon and none of this would have happened.  Instead I'm at home eating my cold pizza after spending 63 bucks for us to be treated like crap.  Not cool!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seal-beach?start=80

About over 1 year ago my son was eating his favorite Penne Cream Pasta and there was a piece of a metal brillow pad in his food, this is what they scub the pans with.  Yes they comped his plate and brought out a new dish, and said sorry, but that was all. Last night some how he cut the top of his tongue.  My son said that he bit his tongue and I looked and didn't see anything, but later that night he was bleeding profusely and it took a while to stop.  Though the cut was on top of the tongue and that made it difficult to imagine that my 10 year old could bite it there.  So I am thinking that something in the food cut him somehow.  Thank god that what ever it was didn't cut his throat when he swallowed it.   So go at your own risk.  I think a little quality control will go a long way at this location.  We hope to see a change here soon or else we will not go again.   I really hope that the management reads these reviews.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seal-beach?start=80

We sat outside rather than inside even though it was a bit of a chilly night because since the kitchen is ""outside"" the restaurant was really loud and busy but it was a lot more calm outside. Not only that, but they had heaters outside for us.  The customer service was very nice. I couldn't decide on a drink and he let me get both and let me decide which I liked better. The food was okay. It wasn't much special, just pizza and pasta. The main dish that I was impressed with was their special Salad. The CPK salad. It is now a must for me to get it. My boyfriend loves pineapple on his pizza so that was what he got, the pineapple pizza and even he liked my salad better than the pizza. It was really surprising.  All in all, I wouldn't go there too often. It's a nice place to go once in awhile but it's not one I would occupy often because like I had mentioned, I like their salad better than their actual food and I would like to go somewhere where their pasta was really good.

M J.,"Los Alamitos, CA",0,6,5,1.0,10/25/2014,"CPK Seal Beach is a ZERO star in customer service. BEYOND DISAPPOINTED with the customer service experience we had, especially on my son's birthday!  Tony, the manager, is a joke! The hostess (not even interested in knowing her name, she's wearing a pink shirt, blond, heavy set) was extremely rude and arrogant! At around 6:30pm on October 24th,  I was told by the rude hostess that it will take 30 minutes to prepare our table for our party of 18. She also showed me where they're going to seat us. 40 minutes later, another party walked-in (most of them are wearing USC Trojan jerseys), and the rude hostess gave one of the ladies a hug as they approached the reception desk and discreetly said ""I'm giving you this table but keep it down, they were before you on the list-- pointing at us."" The rude hostess saw me looking at her after saying it and knew that I heard what she just said. I was in the reception area standing behind another person. She's not even bright enough to not even realize that several others and I in our party are right there listening to their conversation!  When I saw the party being seated, I went to the reception desk and asked the rude hostess why our table was given away. She arrogantly gave me the excuse that they cannot accommodate our party on that table. But prior to that, no one cared to ask if it's alright to seat our party somewhere else. This is already more than 30 minutes of waiting.  My husband addressed the matter to Tony, the manager. That was a waste of time! He didn't care what my husband has to say. Tony said ""What do you want me to do about it?""Neither Tony nor the rude and arrogant hostess seems to care about it, even after they were told that this is a birthday dinner. A simple ""I'm sorry"" could have fixed the issue. We left CPK after this nightmare experience and went to Pei Wei. What a difference! Without even telling the Pei Wei staff what we just went through, because it's a big group, he assumed that we are celebrating something. Pei Wei gave us a 5-star dining experience. My family is beyond disappointed with CPK having employees like Tony and the rude hostess. They are of disservice to other employees who are working in the kitchen preparing delicious meals. These 2 individuals are tarnishing CPKs reputation for great food!  Since we are local in Rossmoor, my family either dines or order out food through pick up or curbside service 2-3 times a week from CPK. We bring friends, business partners and associates, and birthday celebrations to this CPK location throughout the year. Our previous experiences vary, but the not so great ones prior to this most recent experience is tolerable and not worth  spending my time writing a review. This atrocious experience however, is worth spending every second of my time writing this long review!  Not surprisingly, after reading the other reviews, I think this is what customer service meant to Tony, the manager-- ""Pure disrespect and disregard of customers!""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seal-beach?start=80

Once seated, we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and service. Nathan our waiter was great. The food, ranging from the crispy warm bread served with a seasoned olive oil dip, tangy chicken Piccata, scampi zucchini, meaty Bolognese spaghetti, fresh veggie pizza with chicken, to the Belgian chocolate dessert were all well prepared, served warm and delicious.

I can't stand drive thrus or fast food, I feel like I am punishing my family because I didn't have enough time to work in making dinner in my day. That's where CPK comes in. I can order on my phone through an app and pick it up in 10-20 minutes. They will even bring it to me in my car if I have sleeping kids (which is often). When I have encountered staff they have always been helpful and sweet. I have never been provided slow service or a poor attitude. I appreciate the kids meals being $5.00. I'm pretty sure that is only 5 cents more than a Happy Meal. I love the selection of salads and pizzas that don't leave grease puddles in the box.

Just OK service.  We had to ask for silverware after our waitress brought the food, we had to ask for peppers twice. Not sure if we were supposed to be offered bread, but we never were (maybe it only comes with entrees) $50 lunch for two. Which seems excessive for 2 pizzas, 2 beers and an Ice Tea. We were there for 45 min.  Which seems like a lot of time in a non rush hour time for a single course. For the above I may have given 2 stars, the disgusting part was that while sitting alone on the patio (except for employees)  all the other tables on the patio were festering dirty and un-bussed. The people that were leaving as we got there were talking about the mess on the patio so I'm guessing it was there for awhile.  We said something about the mess to our server, Still nothing done.  2 sets of employees took their break on the patio (not an issue) so they saw the mess.  At the end of the meal we called out a manager who while polite and apologized seemed to be bothered by having to talk to customers and made no attempt to make any type of guest recovery.   CPK is one of those restaurants on my  ""I never need to eat there again"" list.  My last experience at another CPK (GardenWalk) was similar to this one, which makes me think it is a chain wide problem. We  went there as we had a gift card so I thought I would give them another chance.  Chance taken, chance regretted.

Service was great (I would give them 3/4 stars on it), but the quality of the food and the pricing of the items are ridiculous for what they serve. I got a mango iced tea, a spinach dip for an appetizer, and a pizza, which all came up to $30 (not including tip).  First, my mango iced tea refill had a black speck floating around in it. The spinach dip was not great. I had better and worst spinach dips before. The dip tasted like cheese sauce, with some  chopped spinach thrown into it, and microwave together. The chips that came with the dip tasted like tortillas chips from a bag that you can get a grocery store. Lastly, the pizza I got looked like it was just thrown together and was extremely greasy. My pizza barely had any sauce on it, and the toppings were all over the place.  -I wish I would have taken photos for you viewers.

I really don't know) stood around chatting while no one left and no one came. Finally my husband got up and asked if there was a table we could possibly have. They said ""let me go ask""... There was more than half of the restaurant available, and why would the hostess not know if a table was available?. but we waited another 5 minutes.

We have both been going to various CPKs for years, but when this one opened up right down the street from us, our visits became far more frequent. We consider CPK to be one of the restaurants that is perfect for groups of friends, and as a default for when you don't know what you want to eat. You can't go wrong with CPK. There expansive menu is incredible. They have managed to incorporate pizza with many different cuisines with their many different combinations. There salads are always fresh and more delicious than you ever thought salad could be. There pizzas are truly some of the best. And there pastas are filling and comforting. Our favorite thing to do is split a large caesar salad and the Sicilian pizza.

The wait staff does try, but seem to be preoccupied on cleaning, preventative maintenance and initial visuals.  Watching the wait staff wipe out the insides of drawers, and the shelves of cabinets during service seems like a no no. Then watching the manager check the work with a flashlight helped me realize that the stake holders are worried about resale value when this location takes a dive.

My daughter was bummed but also happy that she was going to get the sauce she likes.  All went well until we got the bill.  Okay, brace yourself.  As I write this I feel a bit silly but there was a $1.50 extra charge for my daughters lemon caper sauce.  I asked the waiter why we were charged this and he said that the manager put it on the bill and it was out of his control.   Let me get something straight.  Our waiter was fantastic!  He clearly felt bad.   I know... capers cost more.... But it's a KIDS MEAL!  No meat!  Only pasta and you charge me almost $8.00?  You know.... it's not the amount that bothered me.  It's the principle.  The manager should have come to our table and apologized about the confusion.  He didn't.  I'm thinking he thought we wouldn't even notice it and just pay the bill.  Well... Mr. Manager.   My husband it the Director of Internal Audit (thank god not for CPK!) and we did notice.   I hope your $1.50 was worth is because we spend approximately $100.00 a month at your location and I am going to think twice (no maybe 5 times) before going there again (unless you get transferred.)  There are too many other options in our area that actually want our business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seal-beach?start=140

We had a very inattentive waitress.  She was not concerned with our table at all!!!  We placed the order and received our drinks and appetizers rather quickly, which was fine, but after that the experience was gone!  We received our salads, which were very generous portions, but within 5-7 minutes, not enough time to finish our salads, dinner was on the table.  They did not bring the bread with the salads, but how could she have when food was being thrown on the table!  As plates became empty, they were left to pile on the table!  Natalie passed our table 6 times but did nothing about the plates that were piled in the corner.  She never came by to ask if we would like a refill on our drinks nor did anyone come by to refill the water glasses!  The dessert menu was tossed onto the end of the table with barely a word and an obvious amount of plates piling higher in the corner.  When the time came to pay the bill, she was all over that!   I would also like to mention that the BBQ Chicken Pizza I ordered had approximately 20-25 chunks of chicken on it that did not cover the pizza at all! My hubby and son ordered the Jumbalaya, which has changed so they were a bit disappointed! I always tip 20% to start and if things go awry then I deduct from there! I have NEVER tipped less than 10%...until this night!  I tipped her 5%!   She is not a good representative for any restaurant!  If I am going to spend over $100 on a meal, I expect somewhat decent service!  The restaurant was busy but not overly so!  Our total time at the restuarant was approximately 40 minutes at best due to her desire to turn the table!

Individual fresh made pizzas with, at the time, were truly innovative ingredients. There were many to choose from, among them a very tasty Duck pizza, it was truly an Avant Garde type of place, there was a lot of traffic, the place always crowded, as if people had recognized and embraced the innovative cuisine. Of course, everyone and their cousin in the pizza business started taking notice, and now we have the so called high end pizzeria, which most are a joke served in a fine table and a sure high tab.  We stopped at this CPK (the cool abbreviation they try to promote), 3 of us, and had the following dishes: Fish Tacos 11.79: who would order fish tacos at this kind of place? Apparently one of us did and did not like it, someone else end up eating these two tacos. Panko-crusted Mahi Mahi (barely any), shredded cabbage and house made ranchito sauce. Served with chips, a very so so salsa.2 Stars. Jamaican Jerk Chicken $13.59. This one is described as Spicy sweet Caribbean sauce, authentic Jamaican spices, Nueske's applewood smoked bacon, red onions and bell pepper. Eater finish this creation in two stages. One at the table, the other half at home next day. 3 Stars. The Meat Cravers $14.59. Describe as Macho pizza loaded with Italian Sausage (loaded meaning a total of 4 pieces), pepperoni, applewood smoked ham, spicy Capicola ham and salami. Let me say that there were more open spaces that I though were possible in a pizza, so loaded is baloney, most meat average and extra salty, a sad pizza. 2.5 Stars.

I said no, in a pretty ticked off tone, because she had definitely seen me sitting there not helped for that period of time. I don't know if she didn't know if I was in her section or not? Or if she was just too busy chatting it up with other customers, but by the time she came to take my drink order, I was more than ready to order my food too. She asked if I wanted bread, I said no, and she immediately brought bread anyways.. Food came out pretty fast and everything was fine, but what was done was done and I probably won't return to this location because of it. Absolutely unprofessional and disappointing.

Too much catering to apparent locals/friends and servers being overly involved in conversations with their clique to properly deal with customers.  Been twice now, same experience each time.   With that said, my review for the food is as follows: I love their salads, pizza and pasta...The original chopped salad is amazing and I love the dressing which comes with it - I could eat this salad every day and never grow tired of it.  I always get thin crust pizza's and they are equally tasty (no matter which one I get but my favorite is the pepperoni - I am pretty much a creature of habit but I have tried the bque chicken, the thai chicken and the artichoke/spinach and honestly they are all quite delicious).   Pizza is one of those menu items which is very personal and subjective and imost likely if you come from NY, you just may not find our Cali pizza to be to your quite biased liking (I am from Cali but have eaten plenty of NY pizza, which I love as well) but in no way does it diminish CPK pizza - apples and oranges really.  However, both are equally savory in their own unique ways. Their pasta dishes are delicious and filling.  While admittedly not authentic Italian to some - they are pretty close to the mark and you will not be dissapointed with all the unique, flavorful, pasta delights they offer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seal-beach?start=120

Finally, one day when the food came out way to soon again, we told them to send it back because we were still eating our salads. THEN our waitress (who now has a major attitude, acting as if WE were the problem) comes out with our food, which had been clearly sitting around without being warmed for 15 minutes or so. I got the Chicken Alfredo and my parents got pizza, and they looked and tasted really disgusting and cold. EW! Then, the waitress comes back and asks how are food is, and we tell her its cold, and she has the audacity to tell us that we're wrong! She said that when she sent our food back, they made completely new entrees for us. WRONG. And she never once said something like, ""Oh, I'm really sorry, let me go get the manager for you"" or anything. No apologies at all! Usually, I don't get mad at waiters and waitresses because I understand the stress that comes along with the job, but she LIED! Come ON! Our food was ICE COLD!

I ordered the chicken picatta thinking it might be a healthier entree.  What arrived were dry, tough chicken breasts in a noticeably GREASY sauce.  I was so disgusted with what I ate I went to the gym afterwards to burn off the calories. After asking for the check (who knows what our sophomore waiter was doing) we paid the bill and vowed never to return.  What bugs me more than the crappy food and lackluster service was that the bill for two was over $40 (plus tip).  If I'm paying $20+ per person I expect something better than Carrows/Dennys, etc. With all the chains and restaurants closing and consumers being stingy and selective with their disposable income I wonder how this place will survive.

Jennifer D.,"Los Alamitos, United States",2,9,9,1.0,20/5/2017,"Tonight's visit to California Pizza Kitchen was extremely disappointing. We walked into the restaurant and asked to sit on the Patio. The restaurant was not busy and we sat down right away. On the patio the tables were messy and looked like the tables had not been wiped down. 2 tables were full of dishes that had not been bussed yet. Our waitress seemed distracted. I watched other patrons at the tables go and get water for themselves because our waitress would forget to take care of their request. Each time the server brought out food to the surrounding tables she was apologizing for something. Our food was decent. I had the Italian chopped salad half size, my mom had the zucchini, fettuccine shrimp dish, one daughter had the kids macaroni cheese and my other daughter had the Bahn mi bowl which is new on the menu. Not once were we asked if the food was okay or would like a drink refill. We had to ask for place settings as well. I would understand if this restaurant was slammed but they were not busy. During the middle of our meal I finally saw one guy bus a table. Another party of 7 came to sit on the patio and this party individuals were the ones that set up the table. The host that brought them out did not assist. It was time for our bill and my mom picked up the tab. She gave our waitress her credit card. We sat for 10 minutes waiting for her to run the card. She came outside to service her other tables and we asked her about the card and she realized she never ran the card. We waited some more. At this point I went inside to speak with the manager on duty. I told him everything that was going on and all he said was I'm sorry. He didn't offer to compensate anything off the bill. He just simply said thanks for letting me know. I stated to the manager that I frequent their downtown Long Beach location near my office and have had much better service and at that location the manager takes complaints seriously. I hope this location improves on its customer service since I live in the area and do enjoy the brand restaurant. Good customer service starts with good management and came been seen on the floor with staff.

My friends ordered alcoholic libations while I stuck with the Strawberry Mango Cooler which was really cool (low cal too). Our waiter went in and out from ""I hate my job and would rather be somewhere else"" and being friendly.  It still seems to get busy on a weekend night. It's in a giant shopping center so parking at least seems to be manageable.

I'm not a big fan of their (non-alcoholic) drinks, which were overly sweet. I got the strawberry mango cooler, which was just sugary strawberry soda - I couldn't taste the mango, ginger, or guava that was mentioned in the description.

I know it was probably over the top with sodium because my feet swelled up soon after. (haha)   We also got the Thai Crunch Salad (half-sized) to share. My friend forgot to ask no peanuts though.

(Chopped romaine, crunchy fried rice stick noodles, grilled chicken and a midly spicy sweet-tangy dressing) That was tasty but oddly not satisfying.

Handy!  The girl who took my order was efficient and polite, and told me the order'd be ready in 30 minutes.  Son and I arrived about 10 minutes early, but, per instruction, I gave them a call anyway to let them know I was there.  About 30 seconds later, Noah came out to get my payment [just for the record: damn, it was pricey: the bill was more than $50 for two orders of chicken piccata and a one-person-pizza], and, in another 30 seconds, he reappeared with my food and my charge-slip to sign. There it was: that TIP line.  Now, I'm a generous tipper (usually 20% in restaurants; even the pizza delivery guy gets $5 above the additional ""service fee"" from me), but I rarely--if ever--tip on takeout.   But, I rationalized, the guy brought it to my car; that's ""service"", I guess...but what was it worth?  Stupid Me decided to ask.  ""So, how much do people usually tip for curbside service?"" There was a pause, and I could see the wheels turning in Noah's head.  You could tell he was a nice kid, but I'd left that door wide open, and he's apparently easily tempted. He went for it. ""Oh, 20%, that's too much,"" he said with a laugh, buying more time.  ""Usually, more, um, like, um, (pause)...$5...or $7 (pause)...or $10...something like that.""  He blinked at me expectantly, innocently, waiting to see if I'd fallen for it.   I didn't.  ""Yeah, nice try,"" I said. ""How about $3.00?""  I filled out the slip, signed it, and handed it back.   On the drive home, my kid and I laughed about Noah's ham-fisted attempt at robbing me blind.  My kid said that he wouldn't have given him anything, on principle; I argued that the food was walked out to the car.  ""Wow,"" my son said, ""He walked a whole 30 feet.  You tip at drive-throughs, too?""  (He knows I don't.) By the time we got home, we decided that, though you can't really blame a guy for trying, you CAN write a nasty YELP review and tell everyone about it.   BTW: the food was adequate (if expensive) as CPK's food generally is.  We'll probably go back, but the curbside kid gets a buck next time.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seal-beach

The sanitation is terrible.  I found a piece or green lettuce on the knife that I just unwrapped from its paper napkin (see the uploaded picture).  Problems with the dishwasher again!  How hard is it to clean the dishes? We've been here 4 times and found dirty dishes EVERY time.  Apparently this place just can't get it right. Is the O.C. Health Dept. asleep or just incompetent.

Four of us arrived about 15 minutes prior to the last couple ( grandparents of the two kids ) and we ordered as soon as they had put in their drink order.  Naturally our food came much before theirs, but we were hungry and didn't know it would take that long for the split order to be served.  Our waiter was very quick to bring the bread and oil plus a refueling of that.  Our food orders -- California Club Pizza and Chicken Piccata -- were delicious as usual. The clog in the kitchen could have been due to a bunch of things, so I'm not going to pick that apart.  Why the last couple took so long to get to the restaurant is not the restaurant's fault, after all.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seal-beach?start=60

Once we were seated we had to wait 15 minutes just for a waitress to come to our table and take our drink order.  Our waitress Lily was friendly, however she didn't come by and ask if we wanted more water or tea until we were done with our meal.  The worst part of the experience was having every other waiter pass by our table and not pick up our finished plates or offer to refill our glasses.  Food was good, but probably won't be back to this location.  I'll keep my business with the CPK on PCH, always great customer service there!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seal-beach?start=60
Chani B.,"Long Beach, United States",4,4,10,2.0,1/8/2014,"Updated review (8/29/2014):   It took three weeks for me to hear anything back from CPK management in regards to this ""incident"". Thanks to the response from April (RM I presume) and the clear up of facts, the man who claimed to be the GM Darren, in fact was NOT the GM Darren, but another manager named Tony. Darren, I apologize. You're off the hook, but you should remove worthless managers from your staff. Leadership comes from the top and if not removed will cause the staff to act outside of company protocol. They will cause your business to lose money and that's what matters. The bottom line. I still will probably not ever visit this CPK again. I haven't actually gone to a CPK since the ""incident"" and it will be a long while until I step foot into another CPK establishment. But thank you April and Darren for setting the facts straight.  Prior review (8/1/2014): **DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AT THIS PLACE!! LAKEWOOD CPK IS EXCELLENT. TINA IS THE BEST GM ANYWHERE! I go to CPK a lot.. and when I say a lot, I mean like every week at least twice. This is the 2nd time this specific CPK has not only fucked up my order, the asshole old man of a GM Darren, had the audacity to act as if I fucked up my order. No, YOUR COOKS fucked up my order. How hard is it to swap out to thin spaghetti and cook a crust thoroughly, especially when it was told to be well done. I will not come back to this place EVER. 40$ for 2 dishes, no drinks, and bullshit customer service is not worth it.     Their server (can't remember her name) was awesome.

Chris D.,"Garden Grove, United States",509,896,5326,3.0,12/12/2010,"I like California Pizza Kitchen. It's not the best tasting pizza around but it certainly isn't the worst. I like the many unique combination of flavors they have for their pizzas such as buffalo chicken, carne asada, Thai, Jamaican Jerk, and many others. I don't eat here very often but a $25 gift card brought me in today.  Normally I get the Sicilian pizza which is my favorite one but decided to be different. I ordered the ""Four Seasons"" pizza which is ""imported Italian"" tomatoes, oven-roasted artichoke hearts, salami, mushrooms, onions, and big blobs of fresh mozzarella. All of this was sprinkled with fresh herbs, parmesan cheese, and I added chili flakes. It was a very nice pizza. I didn't realize there wasn't any pizza sauce on it which was a bit disappointed but I think this was done so you can taste all the different ingredients. It was simple yet tasty. I'm not sure what it has to do with the seasons but it made for a good lunch on this 88 degree December day!  Donna had the White Pizza which is mozzarella, fontina, riccota, pecorino romano cheeses with fresh spinach, garlic, and apple wood smoked bacon for $1.50 more. If you're going to charge for bacon then at least add more than a few sprinkles. Donna liked it but I would of been pissed by the scarce amount. We swapped a slice to taste each others pizza. To me this white pizza tasted like shit. It has the texture of mashed potatoes and with all these different cheeses you'd think I'd taste some flavor. Barf inducing snooze fest. For some reason my wife enjoyed it.... glad I didn't order it.  Three stars is a good rating for this place since it's hit or miss. The Sicilian pizza for example kicks ass yet the white pizza tastes like ass.... so it's a Russian Roulette type of menu.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seal-beach?start=60

Still no bread.  Get up and walk to Jose and ask for bread.  No apology...brings it.  Food arrives we start eating and the manager walks over.  I'm thinking he's going to say how is the food and the typical greeting, but no.  He says we've locked the doors and your friend will need to show ID for safety purposes.  I stated I can clearly see the door (glass panels) and I'll see when he arrives.  It was very obvious the manager wanted us to leave as soon as possible.  I get it!  I tell my kids I'll just ask for the check and get to-go boxes and tell my boyfriend not to come.  I can't make eye contact with the manager or waiter who is totally MIA doing sidework or something.  People, I just want to leave and get out as I know we are not wanted!  crickets! crickets!  finally a random waitress walks by and I ask for the check and boxes.  She was a delight with a bright smile and geniune kind attitude.  Why couldn't she be our waittress? Here's the funny part.  Jose comes over hands us the check and has the nerve to say,"" here you go, please take your time.""  I literally laughed and said really, take your time, that's funny.   I don't think I've ever felt that unwelcome.  All they had to say was we are closing soon and none of this would have happened.  Instead I'm at home eating my cold pizza after spending 63 bucks for us to be treated like crap.  Not cool!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seal-beach?start=80

About over 1 year ago my son was eating his favorite Penne Cream Pasta and there was a piece of a metal brillow pad in his food, this is what they scub the pans with.  Yes they comped his plate and brought out a new dish, and said sorry, but that was all. Last night some how he cut the top of his tongue.  My son said that he bit his tongue and I looked and didn't see anything, but later that night he was bleeding profusely and it took a while to stop.  Though the cut was on top of the tongue and that made it difficult to imagine that my 10 year old could bite it there.  So I am thinking that something in the food cut him somehow.  Thank god that what ever it was didn't cut his throat when he swallowed it.   So go at your own risk.  I think a little quality control will go a long way at this location.  We hope to see a change here soon or else we will not go again.   I really hope that the management reads these reviews.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seal-beach?start=80

We sat outside rather than inside even though it was a bit of a chilly night because since the kitchen is ""outside"" the restaurant was really loud and busy but it was a lot more calm outside. Not only that, but they had heaters outside for us.  The customer service was very nice. I couldn't decide on a drink and he let me get both and let me decide which I liked better. The food was okay. It wasn't much special, just pizza and pasta. The main dish that I was impressed with was their special Salad. The CPK salad. It is now a must for me to get it. My boyfriend loves pineapple on his pizza so that was what he got, the pineapple pizza and even he liked my salad better than the pizza. It was really surprising.  All in all, I wouldn't go there too often. It's a nice place to go once in awhile but it's not one I would occupy often because like I had mentioned, I like their salad better than their actual food and I would like to go somewhere where their pasta was really good.

M J.,"Los Alamitos, United States",0,6,5,1.0,25/10/2014,"CPK Seal Beach is a ZERO star in customer service. BEYOND DISAPPOINTED with the customer service experience we had, especially on my son's birthday!  Tony, the manager, is a joke! The hostess (not even interested in knowing her name, she's wearing a pink shirt, blond, heavy set) was extremely rude and arrogant! At around 6:30pm on October 24th,  I was told by the rude hostess that it will take 30 minutes to prepare our table for our party of 18. She also showed me where they're going to seat us. 40 minutes later, another party walked-in (most of them are wearing USC Trojan jerseys), and the rude hostess gave one of the ladies a hug as they approached the reception desk and discreetly said ""I'm giving you this table but keep it down, they were before you on the list-- pointing at us."" The rude hostess saw me looking at her after saying it and knew that I heard what she just said. I was in the reception area standing behind another person. She's not even bright enough to not even realize that several others and I in our party are right there listening to their conversation!  When I saw the party being seated, I went to the reception desk and asked the rude hostess why our table was given away. She arrogantly gave me the excuse that they cannot accommodate our party on that table. But prior to that, no one cared to ask if it's alright to seat our party somewhere else. This is already more than 30 minutes of waiting.  My husband addressed the matter to Tony, the manager. That was a waste of time! He didn't care what my husband has to say. Tony said ""What do you want me to do about it?""Neither Tony nor the rude and arrogant hostess seems to care about it, even after they were told that this is a birthday dinner. A simple ""I'm sorry"" could have fixed the issue. We left CPK after this nightmare experience and went to Pei Wei. What a difference! Without even telling the Pei Wei staff what we just went through, because it's a big group, he assumed that we are celebrating something. Pei Wei gave us a 5-star dining experience. My family is beyond disappointed with CPK having employees like Tony and the rude hostess. They are of disservice to other employees who are working in the kitchen preparing delicious meals. These 2 individuals are tarnishing CPKs reputation for great food!  Since we are local in Rossmoor, my family either dines or order out food through pick up or curbside service 2-3 times a week from CPK. We bring friends, business partners and associates, and birthday celebrations to this CPK location throughout the year. Our previous experiences vary, but the not so great ones prior to this most recent experience is tolerable and not worth  spending my time writing a review. This atrocious experience however, is worth spending every second of my time writing this long review!  Not surprisingly, after reading the other reviews, I think this is what customer service meant to Tony, the manager-- ""Pure disrespect and disregard of customers!""",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seal-beach?start=80

From our previous experiences our expectations were set low. The wait was a bit long because we were a party of 6 and preferred indoor versus patio seating which limited table availability. Once seated, we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and service. Nathan our waiter was great. The food, ranging from the crispy warm bread served with a seasoned olive oil dip, tangy chicken Piccata, scampi zucchini, meaty Bolognese spaghetti, fresh veggie pizza with chicken, to the Belgian chocolate dessert were all well prepared, served warm and delicious. The only disappointment was the warm roasted veggie salad. It just did not taste as good as when we first tried it before.

I can't stand drive thrus or fast food, I feel like I am punishing my family because I didn't have enough time to work in making dinner in my day. That's where CPK comes in. I can order on my phone through an app and pick it up in 10-20 minutes. They will even bring it to me in my car if I have sleeping kids (which is often). When I have encountered staff they have always been helpful and sweet. I have never been provided slow service or a poor attitude. I appreciate the kids meals being $5.00. I'm pretty sure that is only 5 cents more than a Happy Meal. I love the selection of salads and pizzas that don't leave grease puddles in the box.

Bill S.,"Garden Grove, United States",64,44,19,1.0,3/3/2012,"Just OK food Both of our thin crust pizzas were not crispy or hot, they tasted like they had been on a warmer.  Just OK service.  We had to ask for silverware after our waitress brought the food, we had to ask for peppers twice. Not sure if we were supposed to be offered bread, but we never were (maybe it only comes with entrees) $50 lunch for two. Which seems excessive for 2 pizzas, 2 beers and an Ice Tea. We were there for 45 min.  Which seems like a lot of time in a non rush hour time for a single course. For the above I may have given 2 stars, the disgusting part was that while sitting alone on the patio (except for employees)  all the other tables on the patio were festering dirty and un-bussed. The people that were leaving as we got there were talking about the mess on the patio so I'm guessing it was there for awhile.  We said something about the mess to our server, Still nothing done.  2 sets of employees took their break on the patio (not an issue) so they saw the mess.  At the end of the meal we called out a manager who while polite and apologized seemed to be bothered by having to talk to customers and made no attempt to make any type of guest recovery.   CPK is one of those restaurants on my  ""I never need to eat there again"" list.  My last experience at another CPK (GardenWalk) was similar to this one, which makes me think it is a chain wide problem. We  went there as we had a gift card so I thought I would give them another chance.  Chance taken, chance regretted.

Asparagus & Arugula salad: Fresh arugula, asparagus and sun-dried tomatoes with lemon-herb vinaigrette, topped with toasted almonds and shaved Parmesan cheese.  - Really yumm.   Crispy Artichoke hearts : deep fried with Japanese panko bread crumbs, then sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.

Our cocktails: Martini on the rocks and Appleberry Sangria. Service was ok.  A bit slow even though it wasn't even rush dinner hour.  Must be low on staff...

The spinach dip was not great. I had better and worst spinach dips before. The dip tasted like cheese sauce, with some  chopped spinach thrown into it, and microwave together. The chips that came with the dip tasted like tortillas chips from a bag that you can get a grocery store. Lastly, the pizza I got looked like it was just thrown together and was extremely greasy.

We finally just went across the street to to Islands and we were greeted by a happy young lady who went the extra mile to make us feel welcome.

Ok, part of that star can also go to their idea of the Small Cravings Menu.  Finally, something not ""Super Sized"" or ""Go Big""....appetizers the size of, um, appetizers, not giant plates of stuff that get you so full that you can't eat your main course!  HOWEVER, CPK should not be calling the White Corn Guacamole this name, they should be calling it a White Corn Salad with Avocado because guacamole it is not. I couldn't get into my spring rolls.  To me, the cheese in it didn't go well and the peanut sauce was too sugary.   And I guess, I missed the announcement, but I don't like their new Chinese Chicken Salad.  It used to have a vinaigrette dressing and mandarin oranges.  Now it has a sweet and sour dressing that I also found too sugary.  That was the only thing I used to enjoy ordering from CPK way back when.  And my lettuce was all dried out, too.  It made me sad.

Might have been easier to see me if you were behind your desk! Did it stop there? Nope! Sure enough I sit down, and watch a waitress in the area, Carmen, serve ATLEAST 3 other tables in the same section as me, stare me in the eye, but continued about her business and completely ignored me for probably another 10-15 minutes. When she finally came over to me, she asked if anybody had taken my drink order yet. I said no, in a pretty ticked off tone, because she had definitely seen me sitting there not helped for that period of time. I don't know if she didn't know if I was in her section or not? Or if she was just too busy chatting it up with other customers, but by the time she came to take my drink order, I was more than ready to order my food too. She asked if I wanted bread, I said no, and she immediately brought bread anyways..

Marie M.,"Los Alamitos, United States",0,20,,3.0,6/9/2013,"My whole family has been coming to this CPK since they opened.  Additionally I used to come here as often as twice a week to get take-out for lunch.  I was addicted to the miso fresh crab salad and a southwest corn chowder (forgot the exact name) that they don't have anymore.   Their food was so good I overlooked the trips back (about 50% of the time!) when they got my order wrong for take-out.  But since then, the pizzas have been shrinking  while the prices exploded. I haven't been there for about 6 months and had a craving today.  A tiny cheese pizza and iced tea cost me nearly $15!  That's just ridiculous.  Sorry CPK we have to say good bye, the value just isn't there, not even close!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seal-beach?start=140
Colleen W.,"Long Beach, United States",16,292,,3.0,6/6/2013,"I feel like this location is going down hill.  I have been to this and many other CPK's and I was a bit disappointed.    We ordered the Tostada Pizza.  It was dry...the whole Pizza tasted dry.  Very little sour cream, the beans were dry and it was just ehhhhhh.  We also ordered the Artichoke spinach Pizza and the spicy Chipotle chicken pizza.  The artichoke spinach was OK, some of the artichokes were cut in big chunks and hard as rocks.....but it  was overall OK and nothing to rave about.  But the Chipolte Chicken Pizza was very good with just enough spice to be interesting without it being overwhelming.  For dessert the five of us shared a Red Velvet cake.    We found the cake very enjoyable..  The cake was very Moist and the frosting didn't take over the cake.  It was very good.   The service was OK.   I would have to say that past visits were more like a 4 star and this was definitely a 3 star visit.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seal-beach?start=140

She never came back to get us refills or ask how the food was. Also while we were waiting there was some sort of workplace drama going on one of the chefs came out and started complaining about someone and all the waiters and waitresses were huddled talking smack. I was trying to ignore it, but they were literally right there by our booth. I think it's so unprofessional to have these gossip sessions in front of customers.

Catherine R.,"Long Beach, United States",121,28,,1.0,10/7/2013,"This place is HORRIBLE. Granted, the food would be really good if it wasn't cold and actually came out in a timely manner. Unfortunately, me and my family used to come here often, and every single time our dinner came out while we were still eating our salads! Finally, one day when the food came out way to soon again, we told them to send it back because we were still eating our salads. THEN our waitress (who now has a major attitude, acting as if WE were the problem) comes out with our food, which had been clearly sitting around without being warmed for 15 minutes or so. I got the Chicken Alfredo and my parents got pizza, and they looked and tasted really disgusting and cold. EW! Then, the waitress comes back and asks how are food is, and we tell her its cold, and she has the audacity to tell us that we're wrong! She said that when she sent our food back, they made completely new entrees for us. WRONG. And she never once said something like, ""Oh, I'm really sorry, let me go get the manager for you"" or anything. No apologies at all! Usually, I don't get mad at waiters and waitresses because I understand the stress that comes along with the job, but she LIED! Come ON! Our food was ICE COLD! THEN the manager comes over, and he's just as bad as the waitress! He had a clearly annoyed look on his face and acted like we were bothering him. No smiling, very few apologies (if any?); SO rude. Clearly, bad customer service is tolerated here. It's so sad to see a restaurant with so much potential go up in flames like this. If I could give 0 stars, I would.

Devon B.,"Aliso Viejo, United States",120,243,103,3.0,19/6/2008,"So everyone's been to a CPK, and they're all pretty much the same.  This one is nice and new though, so it looks clean and has a fancy bar.  I went last night with my husband's immediate family, which means there were 10 adults and 7 kids.  They handled us very well, and the server was really patient with the small ones who were getting under her feet while she was trying to take our order.  We had a bunch of pizzas and a couple of salads to share.  I had the peach lemonade, which was yummy and also came with free refills.   Chopped Salad and Greek were typical.  The BBQ chicken pizza is always good at CPK (I think they were one of the first to start that trend).  We also had the vegetarian eggplant, pepperoni, pear and gorgonzola, carne asada, and margarita.  My favorite, surprisingly, was the margarita.  Even though it's simple, the tomato sauce tasted really fresh and the crust was nice and thin.  The pear and gorgonzola was tasty too - it had a salad of mixed baby greens on top and I liked that it wasn't as sweet as the one we had at Z Pizza recently.  The carne asada was kind of strange for me, with a chile verde sauce that I felt didn't belong on pizza.  Overall, it was a good meal, but I'm only giving it 3 stars because of it's ""chain-iness"" and because there was nothing really outstanding.  I haven't been there in a while, but it seems like they've raised their prices too.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seal-beach?start=160

John O.,"Newport Beach, United States",33,230,36,1.0,28/9/2009,"After a long day at  work you sometimes just want to relax and have a nice meal.  Such was not the case with CPK at the Shops At Rossmoor.  I am not a huge fan of CPK, but then I haven't had a bad meal with them until now.   My guest and I came into the restaurant only to wait a couple of minutes at the hostess station.  Given that there were as many or more employees than customers you have to wonder why we weren't acknowledged as soon as we walked in.  Once we got seated our 16 year old waiter stopped by and took a drink order.  When he brought the drinks one or both had spilled on his serving tray which he tipped and spilled on the table and my booth seat.  He didn't say a word. I ordered the chicken picatta thinking it might be a healthier entree.  What arrived were dry, tough chicken breasts in a noticeably GREASY sauce.  I was so disgusted with what I ate I went to the gym afterwards to burn off the calories. After asking for the check (who knows what our sophomore waiter was doing) we paid the bill and vowed never to return.  What bugs me more than the crappy food and lackluster service was that the bill for two was over $40 (plus tip).  If I'm paying $20+ per person I expect something better than Carrows/Dennys, etc. With all the chains and restaurants closing and consumers being stingy and selective with their disposable income I wonder how this place will survive.

I was finished with my drink by the time my food came out and had to beg for bread twice, then my waitress brought it out at the same time as the food. after starvig and begging for service, the food was cold. I ordered the chicken Marsala and the chicken was so cold that I couldn't eat it. so then my brother offers me a piece of his BBQ chicken pizza which was also stone cold. it was as if they were trying to heat up left overs in an easy bake oven. finally we called over a manager and explained to him what happened. he told us that he would compensate us for our meal and we would have asked him to remake our food but we were there for an hour and were starving. when he gave us the bill he did not take everything off and we ended up wasting so much time and money.

The kids (literally, that's what they are here) who function as waiters spend every second flirting with each other.
