Joy H.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",21,99,3,5.0,7/1/2009,"I love CPK ASAP. I've always said I wanted sit-down restaurant food in a fast food setting. Why? Because it'd be much cheaper and I can get my own drinks instead of waiting for the waiter to come around to refill my drink, and paying extra for this privilege. An original BBQ chicken pizza is $7.99 at CPK ASAP.  It's $12.99 at the ""real"" CPK. Then the drinks are $1.79 at ASAP and closer to $3 at the CPK. At the real CPK, there's often a wait, you either have terrible parking or you have to pay the valet. When my boyfriend and I go then we spend an additional $6 or $7 on tip. Instead of spending $40+ at CPK, we share a drink at CPK ASAP and spend $18 and we're never waiting around for the waiter to refill our drinks while we're thirsty. It's half price for the same thing (less the waiter, wait, and parking). The only problem I see is that the selection is limited compared to the real CPK. I wish more people would patronize places like this, but I guess everyone else likes paying double the price for ""service"" and ""ambiance.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sherman-oaks
Anthony N.,"Playa del Rey, CA",4974,2742,19397,2.0,2/9/2010,"My first experience at a CPK Asap in Culver City was not that good.  I had a pizza there so I figure I would try the pasta at this location.  I went with the tomato basil spaghetti.  At some CPK restaurants, I felt they used too much garlic in their pasta dishes.  The use of garlic here was fine though. The spaghetti with the tomato sauce was kind of boring and really not good.  Kind of like something you would expect from the freezer.  The food came out quick.  Most of their dishes were priced at or around $10. 1.5 stars.  I rounded up because service was quick and I did not leave hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sherman-oaks
Courtney B.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",53,92,18,4.0,2/16/2010,"This is a good CPK! It's quick, especially when you are in the mall and you need something ASAP.  (Pardon the pun).  Never have I felt rushed to be here and the service is always great.  My friends and I would sometimes come here after class whenever we had something going on for our high school.  Needless to say, the people who were working there never gave us dirty looks because we were ""some high school kids"", and  to me, that's a good thing.  Also, when this first CPK opened, I was working at the Disney Store in order to make sure that the people working at the mall tried the food, they brought some over to us.  Probably so we could recommend it to the people shopping, but heck, that's what got me to come there in the first place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sherman-oaks
