Victor A.,"Jersey City, NJ",118,137,38,4.0,2/11/2013,So its my first time at California Pizza Kitchen.  I've passed by these a million times and never stopped in.  They're actually pretty good.  I had the mushroom pie.  Very good.  Crispy thin crust.  The menu seems to have a lot of fresh options.  For a chain I have to give kudos.  If I had to choose between the chains this would be a top option.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=60
Allen C.,"Parsippany, NJ",0,16,,5.0,7/16/2012,I am a fan of this place. This one is much better then the one in willowbrook mall.  We also order seafood miso salad with a pizza. The food is always good and service is fair.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=60
Pasquale R.,"Madison, NJ",1731,1527,245,1.0,12/6/2010,"By the name alone you can figure out that the pizza will be terrible! I mean who correlates Cali and Pizza??? Wine, yes. Pizza, no. Then why in the world would someone who lives in the NJ/NY area even consider stepping foot in here? We are surrounded by the best pizza outside of Italy. I was literally dragged to this place.  I fooled myself into believing that at least I can kill the taste with a few alcoholic beverages because I already knew the pizza will suck. After we sat down I noticed there wasn't a bar in the place. That's OK, I am sure they still serve alcohol. Scanned the menu, still nothing. The waiter came over. ME: I will have a Yuengling please. WAITER: I am sorry sir, we don't serve alcohol here.   I nearly walked out. My friend said ""don't worry, the pizza is really good here"". Damn it, he already tricked me once so I was skeptical. My pizza came out. I took a bite and visions of me grabbing a fork and jabbing my friend in the eye crossed my mind. I nearly spit it out. The dough taste's like thick cardboard. The sauce was worst than store brand sauce. The cheese tasted like it had been stepped on by the entire staff of the restaurant and then placed on the pizza. I KNEW IT! Tricked again. Even the diet coke was flat....  I took another bite thinking maybe I am overacting. No shot, it was even worse. I was done. I pushed my plate aside and just stared at my friend with anger. Nearly $20 later and not eating anything I punched my friend in the head as we walked out. He was content with his meal...like it makes any difference.  Avoid it and go to your local pizza place...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=60
Lordbarky K.,"Short Hills, NJ",0,30,,4.0,3/26/2015,"Great for lunch,  lettuce wraps very tasty.  Pasta full of flavor.

Kurtis P.,"Matawan, NJ",56,435,2,3.0,3/25/2013,"It's really sad when a place with the name ""Pizza"" in their title falls short on that one main dish. Their menu is packed full of many options and many sound great in theory, but the Pizza itself falls short and is really adequate at best. Luckily, their are other options on their menu and their salads really are the best choices. With many to choose from you can't go wrong there. CPK has that relaxed vibe, both in decor and atmosphere, and along with being BYOB it gives you more of a casual dining experience, especially for a mall. The service is alright and the prices are reasonable, but with many other dining options in the mall, I'd say you should really think twice. Another drawback is the relatively small dining room.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=60
victoria v.,"Staten Island, NY",238,294,15,3.0,6/12/2010,"Do you retain any memories of being 1 year old? Of your first ever sip from a straw? What about when that sip from a straw brings up to your thirsty lips a delicious syrupy mouthful of chocolate milk? If so, this place is a five star joint for my 1 year old twins. They reeeeeeeally loved their mac n cheese and first time having chocolate milk :P I ordered the goat cheese, roasted pepper and eggplant pizza. It was oddly lacking in flavor. I liked the kids creamy mac n cheese better.  I would go back here and put up with meh pizza because this place made my kids so happy.

Neharika M.,"Cranford, NJ",0,5,,1.0,12/28/2014,Horrible experience. Never going back. They refused us seating saying we have a party of 8 adults and 2 little kids.

Holly C.,"New York, NY",405,1256,5,3.0,12/9/2012,"Had salad and pizza while shopping in the mall. Yes, it is not the best pizza, but it's a chain restaurant so I think it's only fair to rate it at the level of Applebee's and Longhorn, etc. With that said.

Scott D.,"Short Hills, NJ",17,67,5,3.0,3/18/2011,"Chain restaurant pizza.  Not the typical east coast fare, as it's a gourmet interpretation of the pizza now done at the chain restaurant level. So you're not going to get the quality of a John's or Lento's or other classic pie sellers.  What you do get are fresh dough, with very creative and thoughtful combos of toppings. But let's be truthful, unless you get to the higher end of a chain restaurant (Ruth's Chris?) you aren't talking stellar food.  Come here because you're in the mood for a salad or pizza and you're in the mall. This particular CPK has spotty service, sometimes it seems like they forget you exist.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=60
Angela L.,"Manhattan, NY",94,21,,3.0,5/15/2011,"I'm not from NJ and having traveled all the way to Short Hills Mall to go shopping, this is one of the few restaurants that is available to the shoppers since the mall doesn't have a food court. (Which I totally understand!) With that said, I'm taking away one star because the line is always horrendous and about 1-1 1/2 hours wait for the lunch crowd. The hostess was as nice as one can be with hoards of hungry shoppers hounding her every second. Ok so onto the food.... Appetizers we got the Korean tacos and white corn guacamole with chips. The tacos were differently NOT korean but they attempted by smothering it with some asian sauce (kinda sweet and salty) but pretty good nonetheless... we were starving after waiting 1 1/2 hours for our table. The white corn guacamole was yummy with sweet corn and huge chunks of avocados. But this is their new ""small snack menu"" so please be aware that portions are SMALL. For entrees my sister always gravitates to the Portabello mushroom ravioli. I had the garlic creamy fettucini with shrimp and my parents shared the pizza with The Works. (I know I know, everyone should get the BBQ chicken...) But our dishes were yummy. My mom was raving about how well cooked the shrimp was in my fettucini which actually surprised me. Pizza was goo but a tad sweet for me, I think it's their sauce. For dessert we shared the new strawberry shortcake and hot fudge sundae with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. Let me tell you, for their small portions, the desserts were MASSIVE! Nothing fancy, but good old haagen daz ice cream with hot fudge and whip cream YUM. My parents and sister devoured the strawberry shortcake but I was pretty much busy working on my sundae :) I don't think the pizza is anything to rave about, but when you're a hungry shopper and finally get a table, this place hits the spot!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=60
George S.,"Short Hills, NJ",1,41,3,3.0,12/17/2012,"BBQ chicken pizza is very good. California club sandwich is really good (the bread is like pizza dough, tasty). Thai crunch salad is good too. Pretty good food, I go here a lot, usually for take out. My main complaint would be orders getting messed up, happens A LOT. At the restaurant or over the phone, have had problems with both. One thing many of you may not know, that I found out the hard way, is that orders over the phone are done through a call center. Sounds ok right? Well it's not ok if the restaurant doesn't receive your order from the call center, which happened once. After talking to the manager, they said it actually happens somewhat regularly which was troubling. You've been warned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=60

Evan G.,"New York, NY",45,332,35,3.0,12/25/2008,"I had never been to a CPK until fairly recently because I have found that I much prefer a local pizza place than a chain.  However I was meeting a friend who loves them and wanted to go, so I went with them. The service was good and the place was clean but I was not impressed at all with the food.  I thought the pizza was just ok.  It definitely was not the worst I have had, but its far from the best.

Dodya R.,"Millburn, NJ",288,52,,3.0,6/6/2012,"I am a huge fan of this restaurant. First off, I want to say that the food there is consistently good. The atmosphere could be improved and they could also improve on making the restaurant less quieter and more adult friendly. The service is always good and when something isn't properly cooked they will take it back and start all over. (Depending in what it was). It was considerably better and of course the cheesecake factory is much better, sometimes. In the end, this is a worthwhile place to dine at and you will definitely enjoy yourself.

Aleksandra K.,"New York, NY",7,55,,4.0,4/13/2008,"Whilst still in high school, California Pizza Kitchen, or CPK as we called it, was one of the prime locations my group of friends and I would choose to have our birthday dinners at. The others were The Cheesecake Factory and occasionally Hooters. So you can see how psyched we were that a CPK opened up at our beloved Short Hills Mall. Even though we all really enjoyed the pizza, the main attraction, though some may deny it, was the spinach and artichoke dip, or as we called it: spindip. This dip alone deserves 5 stars as we would seriously go through about 3 orders in 3 minutes. There was always a mad dash to fish out the bigger tortilla chips for optimum dipping. And if the other side of the table somehow managed to still be eating theirs after we finished ours, there would certainly be cunning plans arranged to somehow plunder the precious bits of spindip left over. Seriously, the stuff was THAT good. As for the pizza, it's your traditional personal pan pizza, and they have great combos of toppings to choose from our you can make your own. I remember our male counterparts would always arrange ordering different pizzas so they could trade. I would recommend one but they were all really good. CPK was a big deal. It still is when we find ourselves all home from college break and our go to spot is always CPK for that reunion dinner. And no one has changed a bit. We still thoroughly guard our table's spindip from the vigil eyes of our neighbors, and the boys always have complex discussions before figuring out the perfect 4 way combo of pizza toppings. Oh the memories. I suppose the only reason I won't give this review 5 stars is because the service can be slow, and I really wish they'd give us more of that delicious dip and less crumbly tortilla chips. Also, it's not exactly cheap, something like $17-20 per person (depending on whether you order a drink). And sometimes it takes a while to get seated, as the place gets pretty crowded. I would definitely recommend CPK on any occasion, and order the spindip!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=60
Samantha S.,"Clark, NJ",501,462,,3.0,9/11/2010,This place is a decent choice when I'm in Short Hills Mall.  I've had the margherita pizza - pretty basic and good.  I also love the Broccoli Sun Dried Tomato Fusilli.  It's a very family oriented place - there's always a lot of screaming kids.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=60
J S.,"East Hanover, NJ",3,52,6,5.0,4/26/2011,"I love the salads they have here, especially the BBQ chicken salad. I have not found one like it in this area, and whenever I go to the Short Hills Mall, this is where I'll go for lunch usually. I also enjoy their appetizers. I've only had their pizza twice, but I don't find it to be as bad as other reviewers on this page. The only downside is it can get MAJORLY crowded during lunch hour with waits of up to an hour or more. I wish they had a freestanding venue rather than a mall location, but other than that, I enjoy eating here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=80

Stefanie M.,"East Hanover, NJ",47,83,,4.0,3/2/2008,"California Pizza Kitchen, or CPK as it is also known, makes THE BEST spinach-artichoke dip I have ever had.  The pizza's not bad either. My friends and I used to go to the CPK in the Willowbrook Mall, but the one they just opened in Short Hills is much closer and just as good.  The pizza dishes are great; they have a variety of toppings and the portions are big enough so that you can share/trade slices with your friends and still have enough to take home.  The salads are great as well and though I have never tried the pasta there, I hear it's good. CPK's mall location makes it great for lunch or when you need a shopping break.  Personally, I usually go for dinner (great for large groups, i.e. birthday parties).  Still, I have yet to be disappointed by the service or food...or the memories I've had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=80

Michelle C.,"Hudson County, NJ",39,172,77,3.0,7/17/2010,"CPK?! WTF is that about? I've never heard anyone call it that, but hey, I guess I'm not hip and in the know. Not the first time I've come to that realization. But I digress. One of these restaurants is also in Garden State Plaza (probably better known to all the hipsters as GSP). I never gave it a second thought. Every time I walked by, I just thought pretentious people eating pretentious pizza. No, thanks. Yesterday, I became one of those people. Let's call it a sacrifice, kids. That's what happens when you date someone who has  to buy a contraption to hold their plastic bags. But I digress, again. As usual, there was a crowd of people waiting to be seated right outside the entrance. ""Mongo for two, please."" That'll be a 30 minute wait. ""Sure."" A short fifteen minutes later, the host seated us at a small corner table by the window. Thanks, garcon. If this place wasn't inside a mall, I might have been very pleased. Mongo knows this chain well, as he raves about their pizza and tiramisu fairly often. With his keen insight and knowledge, we ordered chicken lettuce wraps for an appetizer, The Works and white pizzas, and tiramisu for dessert. Surprisingly, everything came out quickly.  The lettuce wraps were excellent --- 4 perfect, leafy ""cups"" are provided to hold a tangy chicken, potato and crispy noodles mix. Each pie is supposed to feed an average of one person. But, I am not the average person. After two lettuce wraps, I was only able to finish off two small slices of my white pizza. Not that it wasn't good, I was just insanely full. Some white pizza is heavy on the ricotta, but not here. This I liked. I, however, did not like Mongo's ridiculously meaty pizza. Some people may not agree with me, but there's such a thing as too much meat. I took one bite and had to put it down. Obviously, Mongo didn't feel the same way. But, he wasn't able to wipe his pizza tray clean. That's a testament to how much meat there is on this thing. Culinary miracle that he is, he was still able to enjoy the tiramisu, which he swears is made differently and better than most places. Not taking a bite of it, I have to agree just on aesthetics alone. Although the food was better than I thought it would be, I was surprised at how expensive it all was. For that reason and that reason alone, this place gets the 3star nod from me. Oh and when I could hear it, the music was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=80
Jennifer H.,"Hawthorne, NJ",0,11,,2.0,2/24/2010,"Usually when we go to Short Hills Mall, we go to either Paparazzi or Joe's Bar and Grill.  However, this time, we decided to give CPK a try. Much more expensive than it would have been to eat at our usual places.  The kids' menu is not as appealing and as opposed to the other two restaurants, you pay extra for kids drinks ( not included in the price of the kids' meal).  With two children, that adds up!  Service is OK at best.  Not overly accomodating and we did wait quite a bit.  All together, not a horrible experience, but not particularly great, not really worth the wait, and way more $$$ than I had planned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=80

The chips and guac- not a great ratio.. needed more guac and the guac was different- chunks of avo, corn, beans. good though.  My GF pizza- BOMB af. I really loved it. It may have been the best gluten free pizza I've ever had, to be honest. The sauce was on point, the cheese was good quality, and the crust had a good crisp.  My friend liked his Pizza and it came with a really good sauce... a green cilantro sauce, yum!  The prices were a bit outrageous but that's expected of a high end (?) chain.

Upon entrance, we were quickly seated into our table.  However, the moment we asked our server regarding the special offers for the veterans, the attitude of our server changed drastically. When our server brought us the special menu, I felt like he was throwing the menu at us. His attitude made it seemed like we weren't welcomed and made us feel pathetic for asking the offer.. Even after the foods were served, the server didn't check up with us even once..... I wanted to order drink, but I didn't even have a chance to order my coke as no one checked up with us. I got this impression of being mistreated because we asked for a veterans special menu. If it was the case, I think CPK shouldn't offer any deals to veterans period.

Afterwards, it was about 10-15mins and no one checked up on us to see if we wanted some more bread, but other tables were being frequently visited compared to ours. Now I'm not sure if it was our table's location, being at the back corner, we might have been easily forgotten about, but we definitely got checked on way less than other tables around us. Eventually our food came out. We got pizza and salad to share and honestly we loved the food. The food was great, definitely a place for a decent meal that's fairly priced.

I didn't think it was possible to ever get this combination wrong. Run far away and don't ever get this. The memory still sends shivers down my spine. The baked potato soup's the standard. Thank god they got that right. Combo's pricy for what you get.  Service was good and when more bread and olive oil was requested, she happily obliged.

We were given a table in the back that was dirty and the hostess removed the plates. We then waited while standing for 5 minutes for someone to wipe and set our table. This didn't happen until I went and told a passing waiter what we needed. The table was then quickly wiped and we were able to sit down, however with no menus. Our server finally came and gave us menus and our water. We ordered the avocado appetizer which was much smaller than we thought it would be. For main meals we had fish tacos and California club pizza. The fish seemed over cooked or just not fresh as it was chewy. The pizza felt like it just had arugula and some avocado and bacon dropped on it as there wasn't much chicken. We also never received nor were offered bread and oil as seems to be standard for the other tables in the restaurant. Overall disappointed with the cold/indifferent atmosphere, overall poor service, and lackluster food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills

Nutan P.,"NJ, NJ",11,13,5,4.0,3/25/2017,"I went to the CPK in Short Hills a few weeks ago since I heard their cauliflower buffalo wings were great. I went with a date and we got them semi early and were told the wait will be 30 mins long. So we decided to cruise the mall to kill time. We came back 30 mins later and waited another 30 mins because the only 2 seated tables were still being occupied by people. We kept being told the table will be ready in 10 mins, they are just paying their bills but this charade went on for another 20 mins. We finally got to our table and it's in the far corner right near the exit door. I guess that's where they put the 2 guest tables. The waitress was semi attentive. We ordered the Mexican pizza and it was pretty good, I would recommend it. The cauliflower wings were decent but not the best. I would skip those next time. The manager came by our table and realized we had a longer then expected wait and offered us dessert on the house. That was a nice gesture that was greatly appreciated. I'm giving them four stars for that but dinging them a star for the wait. Overall, it was a pleasant first time experience ever at a cpk.

Erica S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",135,6,13,4.0,3/7/2017,"Visited this place around a months ago, the weekend before Valentines Day. It was pretty packed and we waited around 20 minutes for 2 people. **Originally I was going to give them 2 stars because of the lack of tidiness from the busboys but decided to give them 4 stars after seeing how serious they took our comments.**  Starting off with the positive: When seated, our lovely waitress made us feel very welcomed and did a thorough run through of their deals and specials. My boyfriend and I decided to go for the ""Sweet Deal for Two."" For starters, we got the spinach artichoke dip. I would say the dip was a bit on the saltier side for me, but it was very typical for a dip. For entrees, I got the Kung Pao Spaghetti with Chicken while my bf ordered their Original BBQ Chicken Pizza. I was actually quite taken back on how good the kung pao spaghetti was. Growing up with very Chinese parents, I have very high expectations when it comes to anything Chinese. The pizza was delicious and is very sizeable in terms of portion. We topped off the meal with Butter Cake, courtesy of our waitress recommendation. And gotta say, she was so right that the cake was so delicious that when finished, we were both left hanging for more! Some negative feedback:  As we were about to get served with our entrees, the family next to us paid their check and left. While the busboy was cleaning, I noticed the busboy used the exact same plates that were previously brought out with the dessert for the family next to us. To be quite frank, I was disgusted by the reaction since the plates were touched by the previous guests before but just not used. Knowing that sanitary and cleanliness are always a priority for restaurants, I called this out to our waitress who immediately agreed with us and removed the plates. She brought out fresh new ones and notified the restaurant manager asap. The restaurant manager even came to our table and address an apology for the busboy reaction and told us that the busboys were still pretty new and he will give them a talk.  Next, as we were eating dessert, my boyfriend noticed another busboy cleaning the other table that was next to us. To our bewilderment, the busboy didn't really wipe down the table and simply just dusted the crumbs onto the seat. My boyfriend brought this up again to our waitress and she again notified the manager, who took appropriate actions.  Honestly speaking, I do not think these should have happened in the first place, but being a big believer of second chances, I do hope the restaurant took steps to make these changes and address these sanitary issues to the bus boys. Will update when we visit them next again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills

Annika S.,"Short Hills, NJ",0,1,2,2.0,12/26/2016,"So I thought I was going to go for a great meal with my family to cpk. Little did I know that the food would suck. Maybe I should start from the beginning. The wait was about an hour but that was okay because I understand that sometimes it gets a little busy. We sat down and it was a good table and our waiter was accommodating which is why I'm giving it 2 stars. Then we ordered two salads (which were great), something from the kids meal, and a Margherita pizza. We were waiting and waiting and waiting for SO LONG. until......... finally they brought out some bread. Usually you would think that they would bring out the bread earlier, but NOOOOOOOO. We got our food about two seconds after they brought out the bread.  When our waiter brought out the pizza I looked at it and gagged. It was so thin that I think some types of paper are ten times thicker. There was barely any sauce and the amount of oil that was on it made it so soggy and gross that all I could do was fold it 10 times over to eat it. My family had to use napkins to wipe off the excess lake of oil that was on the pizza.  After I ate my salad (btw the half is gigantic) I was just not okay with the pizza at all. I mean after all it is called California PIZZA kitchen. So I called the manager over and he was nice enough to take the pizza off of our check, so I thought that the experience was getting better. Until I decided to order dessert... BIG MISTAKE  For dessert we decided to order a chocolate soufflé while my younger brother got a brownie from the kids menu. When they brought the dessert over I almost laughed so hard because it was so horrendous that it was funny. My younger brother's brownie looked fine while my chocolate soufflé looked like it went through a hot summer day before it came to the table. There was no whipped cream on the brownie like there should've been and the soufflé was melting all over the place.  I usually have a good experience at CPK but this was total crap. I will not be recommending that anyone comes to the California pizza kitchen on a busy day and don't order the thin crust pizza unless you want to eat paper and are into that taste.

The food is always good but I can't have lunch without a glass of water at least.

For the love of God, please don't spread germs or bacteria and all those nasty stuff to the entire restaurants' patron. I wonder how many people will be drinking this woman's bacteria or virus that she might have in her mouth from her glass of water.  I think the bartender name was Alex. I literally stop drinking my soda as soon as I saw that. I was seated at the bar counter with my family and I saw the whole incident.  Also I saw the owner (Not 100% sure) fist bump 2 employees and tapped on an employee shoulder before he went into the open kitchen and start putting topping on the pizza and cutting them. The hygiene is so poor I don't know if I can come back to them again anymore. We are there at least once a month.

Here is my story based what I believe to be factual events.    The Day was May 3, 2014, It was afternoon and my wife and I visited this location for some food.    Wife ordered pizza, which came out as expected.  I ordered pasta with meat sauce,  When it came out to me it looked fine, tasted fine, but as I kept eating, found a nice surprise that looked like spaghetti,  except it wasn't.  It was twine in my food. Yes Twine that appeared like spaghetti.   It was a good 7 inches long.  Think God I did not eat this, who knows what damage this could of caused me.  So I stopped eating and called manager over and showed him before is napped a picture.   First word out of his mouth,  ""Do you want my Job""?    I Don't get this comment one bit and I don't find this funny.   Regardless he apologized and tried to make it right, but I lost my appetite for that and since my wife was finished we just ordered keylime pie.  What I find interesting is you would of think that he would of just offered the meal on the house.  Nope,  He just said i'm going to get you another desert, even though we just had desert and refused his offer.  So he just offered his forced on desert and my meal which was contaminated on the house. I find this insulting and I should of just walked out right then and there, but my wife was 2 weeks from giving birth and didn't want to get her worked up.   I paid the bill in cash including a good tip and left.   It was at this point I felt I needed to go to corporate about this manager and service and hopefully they can make this right.   So I wrote to customer service about my experience.   I waited a week, finally a response guest relations (Leaving the personal information off but lets call her C.M.  She apologized and said they are investigating this matter and to expected a follow-up.  That was from 10/23/2014.   No follow-up, despite multiple responses back to that individual.      So here I am,  Disgusted at Short Hills Location, Disgusted at corporate even more for their lack of response.  Shame on you CPK.  Picture will be uploaded shortly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=20

Christina L.,"West Roxbury, MA",23,24,4,4.0,2/8/2015,"CPK is a great chain. I tried it first in Massachusetts with a lunch soup combo and a salted caramel pudding. So good. I had my first meal in Short hills with a group of ten who originally planned to eat at The Cheesecake Factory one Friday night, but were told it was a two hour wait (I had called ahead and tried to make a reservation for the ten of us. No go). California Pizza Kitchen told us it would be about half an hour. We waited maybe twenty minutes before they buzzed my phone that our table was ready. I had one of the light meals, the Shrimp Scampi Zucchini Fettuchine. Which was awesome. A smaller portion that filled me up, but still left room for some chocolates I got from our yankee swap after dinner. The only downside was they didn't serve any alcoholic beverages, but I was happy with a cranberry spritzer. Today I went back for lunch with my boyfriend and we got a plate of dumplings to share. I forgot how much they just taste like chicken and there is more wrapper than actual dumpling. The excess wrapper is also soft and mushy (in a good, dumpling-y sort of way) but it often felt like I was eating a jellyfish. The taste was good for a chicken dumpling, but there was a lot of sauce. For lunch, he ordered the Kung Pao spaghetti and really enjoyed it. Said it was spicy (but he likes spicy) and he couldn't eat the red chilies because they were hard. I ordered the California Club pizza. Ohhh mama, it was good. And I don't even like avocado all that much. The bacon was crunchy and perfect, the pizza itself was warm and an awesome contrast to the fresh tomato slices, greens and avocado on top. Those flavors were so good, I kind of wished it didn't have chicken on it because it didn't need it! I am so full right now, but I can't wait until later when I have the other half for dinner!

Even though the manager only had on one glove, he did seem to only touch the toppings with the glove. Was not so disgusted at this point! Was happy to see he was working UNTIL this manager and his glove went over to the registers, grabbed the DIRTY menus that the waiters took from the tables and took the menus, sorted/organized them and put them back at the hostess stand, where the hostess gives the menu back to the server to give to us. THEN he stepped outside into the mall and moved a couple baby carriages that were parked outside. On his way back to the kitchen, he pushed in a couple chairs and again fiddled with the register keys and straitened the menus that JUST arrived. He then headed back full circle to the pizza bar to help make pizzas!

I enjoyed this salad - also we tried the BBQ Chicken Pizza... and its extremely generic.... so i dont have much to say about that.  Ill have to try something new next time.. but as long as im seeking simple yet delicious Waldorf salads.....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=40
Chris W.,"Berkeley Heights, NJ",77,136,83,3.0,4/20/2014,"As a father of a 2 year old daughter, CPK is a good dinner option at the mall. You don't have to worry about your kid making a mess because they are used to it. They give kids crayons to keep them busy and the food is good. My fav is the mushroom pizza. My only problem is one time the music was blaring. It was so loud my daughter had her fingers in her ears. I even told the waiter and manager and they didn't turn it down at all. I haven't been back since.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=40
Ranley K.,"Songshan District, Taiwan",98,419,495,4.0,10/18/2011,"Didn't live up to its hype, but I didn't say that was a bad thing. My neighbor and my mother kept hyping this place up and telling me how great it was. Coming from Jersey, I have had all sorts of pizza near home and in the Big Apple. However, I'm never against trying out a chain pizza store because I AM guilty of liking pizza hut. I ordered their ""original"" BBQ chicken pizza and I must say I was very happy with my order. It wasn't to die for, but it didn't make me want to not finish the rest of it. Service was not amazing, but not horrible either. The hostess seated us fairly quickly and our waiter was very attentive. Bottom Line: Worth a try. I hear the salads are pretty good and everyone at the table said that it was very good. Not something you HAVE to try, but if you're in the neighborhood, it won't hurt.  A little pricey, but c'mon, Short Hills Mall...or pardon me ""The Mall at Short Hills""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=40

Ashley B.,"Chatham, NJ",1,11,1,3.0,8/1/2014,"pretty good...was a lot better a few years ago. I often get their Hawaiian pizza, but for some reason, it's not nearly as good as it used to be. I don't know if they changed their recipe...? The only real complaint I have is their take-out service. It seems like no matter how many times I explain my order, it is never correct upon arrival. Regardless, I do recommend to those looking for a bite to eat while doing some leisurely shopping!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=40
Debbie E.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",89,937,16,3.0,9/3/2013,"Typical CPK.   I sat outside by myself and it wasn't a problem.  Good location for business travelers staying across the street at the Hilton.  I had Megan as a server - over-the-top bubbly however it always seemed to be someone else bringing me my food, refilling my tea, etc. Had a half of an Italian Chopped Salad and a 5 cheese pizza.  The iced tea is brewed.  Was approximately $24 before gratuity.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=40
Yizhou E.,"West Orange, NJ",73,75,38,4.0,12/7/2014,"I come here a lot because it's convenient and the food is always consistent.  Atmosphere: If you've been in a CPK, it's the same but busier because of their mall location. Contemporary modern with booths and a few tables in the middle to squeeze extra seating out of their relatively small space. The only issue with this location (as noted in other reviews) is the high number of families with children that come here. During peak times it's almost always loud and noisy with babies screaming.  Service: Depends on the timing because, again it gets pretty crazy. Overall the servers know what they are doing. Ask for bread because they don't give it to you unless you do. It comes with herb olive oil that's pretty good. Food: Like I said, it's consistent. All their thin crust pies are crispy but chewy in texture without being too tough and I always get that crust if I'm getting pizza. That said, their salads are really good too. Sometimes if I want something light, I'll get their chicken or shrimp lettuce wraps for my entire meal and believe me when I say they give you enough to get your fill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=40
Tina Q.,"Bayonne, NJ",0,25,12,1.0,1/17/2016,"A single order-California Club, took me more than 30 minutes! So if you are in a hurry, plz skip this place.

Abi B.,"Chatham Township, NJ",40,42,8,3.0,10/1/2014,"We got takeout last night so I can't say much about the actual dining experience of CPK. We split two appetizers and two pizzas and while we really liked some things, we really didn't like others. The spinach and artichoke was okay, but you could tell it wasn't fresh and was previously frozen just by taste and by the time we got it home after a ten minute car ride, it was completely congealed. We got the guac and it was good! We got the barbeque pizza and we all liked it, however the garlic chicken pizza was rough. The chicken tasted super weird and the pizza was just really dry. We'll probably try to come again and try different things. Not much to say, the whole experience was just so-so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=40
Nicole L.,"Philadelphia, PA",262,493,33,3.0,6/18/2012,"Gotta give it to them for their service.  We were seated in the corner of the restaurant (near the back patio area) and our server was spot on in coming back and checking up on us. We never ran out of water, she gave us a few minutes to try the food and came back to see how we liked it, asked how everything was... awesome service. The manager was funny, friendly, and opened up our winning card promotional thingy (they're running it through July). It gave us 20% off our meal, which we were happy to take. The food itself was only OK... The spinach artichoke dip was not as good as I remembered (maybe I'm just getting old?) The BBQ chicken salad was good, but somehow, felt a little lacking The new habenaro pizza with pork was OK, textually, but not very flavorful (the hot sauce, which we got on the side, was hot, but without depth). Anyway, even though the food was mediocre (at 2 stars), the service warrants bringing this place up to 3.  Maybe it was just me, but I think I might have finally hit my threshold of CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=40
Jackie R.,"HENRYVILLE, PA",23,13,4,2.0,8/28/2014,After shopping all evening there aren't many food options in the mall. We stopped here for a quick bite before driving home. The hostess was super nice but the service was mediocre at best. We ordered the spinach dip which tasted list something frozen and microwaved. It was thick and had a gel like consistency. Definitely wouldn't order again. We each got a full size salad(the Cobb and the peach glaze salad). The lettuce was wilted and the toppings were sparse. For what we paid I would have expected something a bit better but it's a chain...in a mall so I guess maybe we expected too much. Probably wouldn't waste my time or money eating here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=40
Salena M.,"Chatham, NJ",45,385,,4.0,2/24/2013,"This is my 2nd rating and is an update worth noting for since the menu items are becoming more adventurous, better quality and more choices available than the usual pizza, salad and pasta items. Met Anthony, manager of restaurant.  He was informative and friendly to us.  The Short Hills restaurant is flagged for various pilot programs - new menu items and the way they manage staff.   Worth mentioning on new menu items is their white corn guacamole with blue and white corn chips... this was light and exceptional in flavor--the combined ingredients didn't overwhelm each other....Similar to a double shot of espresso,  this dish would be perfect as a double shot.  Tried the spicy stuffed poblano - tasty overall but too rich and a mish-mash of flavors when the pepper is drowning in a pool of sauce. They should lighten up the load of the sauce and lucky me.. my poblano wasn't spicy at all even though it's called spicy. One con I have for this place is if they can offer multi-grain bread (which is healthier!) instead of white.  The spinach artichoke dip is still consistently delicious!  As for kids pizza - order from the ""grown-up"" menu - it's better tasting than off the kids' menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=40

Dana M.,"New York, NY",102,276,96,4.0,2/17/2014,"The pizza here is delicious and very different (if you like to try different types of pizza). They have little appetizers which are so good (the fried mac and cheese is delicious although could definitely make you sick if you eat too much of it). All their locations look exactly the same and serve exactly the same type of food. When you go for sit down food, the service is really good, although often times there is a long wait for a table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=40

I even thought that bring left over home. Such a bad choice to go here. I ordered a thin crust pizza with pear and somehow hazelnut. I couldn't finish a slice since the oil bitter flavor came from the hazelnut. I sent it back. Nobody came here to ask if I want anything else. It seems like nobody cares about your business.
