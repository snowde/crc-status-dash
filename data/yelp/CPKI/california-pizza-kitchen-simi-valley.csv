April M.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,25,59,3.0,11/26/2016,"Wish I would've written a review sooner, as I have had nothing but good things to say on prior visits. But sometimes it's the bad experiences that stand out, which I guess is how we get honest reviews on Yelp.  Normally my husband and I come in 2-3 times a month, we always sit at the bar and have always had great service, great food, and for a corporate family establishment, we were pleased and would give 5 stars. Tonight we noticed that for a while now, the bar staff has been sub par. We always had Summer as our bartender, but we haven't seen her lately. Tonight we had Shauna and she just didn't seem comfortable behind the bar. From my experience, both as a bartender, and as a guest who prefers to sit at the bar, most bartenders command their domain. They move with purpose and are very good at multi tasking, delegating, and consolidating tasks. That was not the case tonight. She was kind, and would probably make a decent server, but don't feel her place is behind the bar. I felt the same way about the bartender on our last visit. It leads me to believe that this location may be having difficulties keeping their bartenders, and it may deter us from coming back and sitting at the bar again. The service is just too slow now, and the bar has lost its personality. It saddens me because this has been a tradition of ours since we moved to Simi 7 years ago.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-simi-valley?start=40
Billy D.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,38,,1.0,11/6/2016,"This place has gone way down hill. Ordered BBQ chicken pizza. Barely any chicken. The pizza surface was about 50% crust. Area for toppings (cheese, onions, chicken, sauce, etc.) was very small. Kids ordered mac n cheese. On kids plate and one adult. Kids plate had more.  For adult portion, they put mac n cheese in this huge dish but the reality is the actual part that holds the mac n cheese is very small. It's an illusion and a very CHEAP trick. Something you won't see at Cheesecake Factory which is the gold standard in chain restaurants.  Not sure if they changed ownership or started franchising, but CPK is nowhere close to what they were years ago. Obviously their motto is to make your servings appear larger than they are by putting them on huge plates or spreading the crust out to cover the whole plate while putting the toppings on a small diameter.  They keep this up they'll be the next big chain to close shop.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-simi-valley?start=40
Laura Marie D.,"Simi Valley, CA",182,17,1,5.0,6/9/2017,"We visited this establishment last night on June 8th 2017. We had a large group of 14 people, it was a graduation party. Everyone ran the waiter ragged and that is putting it lightly. This waiter was so good at his job he had a nice disposition he was very attentive fast and friendly. I was very impressed by his ability to handle a large group without looking stressed at all. I definitely will be back to this establishment and ask for Nick. I want to thank Nick for doing a fabulous job keeping everybody happy. even the older people.! your personality and awesome attitude kept the whole table happy you rock Nick! I love California Pizza Kitchen the food there is amazing I had the roasted veggie chicken salad and I was very satisfied.  The rest of our group were all happy with their meals as well. Thank you for embracing our table  and celebrating with our graduates . you should really keep Nick around he's an awesome waiter!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-simi-valley?start=40
Katrina P.,"Ventura County, CA",174,92,172,4.0,9/22/2016,Nice place to grab a bite to eat. The service was nice and we didn't wait long but I think that was because the was just a few people there for dinner. The food was good and I had no problem with the choices. There is a lot to choose from on their menu. I had the shrimp Alfredo pasta which was delicious. They could have cleaned the seats a little better though...

As we all entered where greeted right away from the Hostess and was seated within about 5 minutes. We wanted to sit outside,but it was a bit nippy.The view of this location is fantastic.With all its lights. I had the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine and my family had several different dishes and we all enjoyed them very well. The servers where very attentive during our complete visit.The store very well maintained,and most of all very clean.Good job.

David R.,"Simi Valley, CA",236,138,57,4.0,4/6/2015,"Meals at California Pizza Kitchen seldom disappoint us.  Most of the time, my wife and I are craving the Waldorf Chicken Salad, but we usually indulge in something else as well such as pasta or a pizza. They seem to be inconsistent lately as far as bringing their fresh bread and olive oil to our table. The last three times we never received it and the time before that we had to ask for it after waiting until after our entrees had already arrived. The food tastes great but sometimes I wonder how they measure their portions.  Between eating in the restaurant and using their take out service, as well as ordering their full salad and their half salad, we are still left wondering what the best bang for the buck is. Overall, we will continue to eat here but possibly not as frequently.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-simi-valley?start=40

Mike T.,"Simi Valley, CA",4728,371,1020,5.0,12/14/2014,Just tried the Jamaican jerk pizza on regular crust for the first time and it was very good. The sauce was sweet and spicy just how it should be and the chicken was also rubbed with the Jamaican jerk seasoning. The pizza also came with yellow and orange bell pepper which also made the pizza sweet and came with Applewood smoked bacon. I highly recommend trying this pizza if you haven't done so already!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-simi-valley?start=40
Cindy H.,"Simi Valley, CA",35,43,88,2.0,2/28/2016,"I met a friend for lunch here... big mistake! We where seated right away then it just took a a nose dive from there. The service was horrible, it took 30 minutes from the time we ordered until we got our food. I got an ice tea and I had to ask for sweetener there was none on the tables,I had to ask for some and that took about 15 min to get. I ordered an original BBQ chopped Chicken salad. No kidding there was about 6 very small pieces on chicken on it and I seem to remember some cheese on it in the past, not now. And a spoon full of corn. It was just very light on the  ingredients.

The second (for my friend) was not good either. We also ordered the Cauliflower appetizer - It was burnt and we couldn't eat it. Most of our dinner ended up it the trash. When I called the manager he said he would make it right by sending me 2 -$15 gift cards. Well, that never happened.

Hanna S.,"Simi Valley, CA",5,55,20,2.0,6/5/2015,"As a pregnant pizza fanatic I was excited to finally give this place a try. At 2 in the afternoon there were maybe a couple open tables which is always a good sign for me. A busy business must be a good business, right? My excitement soon turned to disappointment when our food arrived. My pizza was a flimsy cardboard-like texture that couldn't hold its pathetic amount of cheese and toppings. Taste wise it was alright but definitely not worth $14 for a personal pizza.  Food: 2 stars Service: 3 stars Atmosphere: 3 stars  Overall: 2 stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-simi-valley?start=40

Mike F.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,31,,4.0,5/8/2015,"My wife and I stopped by on the evening of our anniversary for a bite to eat. While I am not too fond of the newer CPK menu, we found something. Our server, Tyler, was courteous, professional and an overall nice guy. :) I ordered fish tacos but when the food was delivered, they were pork tacos. Tyler profusely apologized, verified that he entered the order correctly and promptly worked on getting the corrected meal. About five minutes later, the manager came by and delivered the corrected order as well as state that he will comp the order due to the mishap. Now that is GREAT customer service. So why not five stars? Well, for the service I would give five stars. It was refreshing to see great customer service. While the food was alright, it was the service that was outstanding. Admittedly, I am generally underwhelmed with restaurant food these days but great service is a significant contributor to the overall experience. To that end, Tyler and the store manager (sorry but I did not get a name) did not disappoint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-simi-valley?start=80

Jenny A.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,28,1,3.0,8/12/2015,Food was great as usual.  Service was not bad but not up to the usual service provided when dinning indoors.  It took longer than usual for the server to greet and take the order.  Once the order was taken things went smoothly  but then fell apart again towards the end.  I think the server forgot about our table because it took forever for us to get the bill. I got the sense that the server was new because he lacked confidence and was a bit intimidated every time he approached us.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-simi-valley?start=80
Chris C.,"Moorpark, CA",40,281,38,1.0,1/14/2014,"As a bonafide pizza lover, I've had great pie and some not-so-great pie.  Things that make a great pie are a tasty and moist crust.  The kind that you can fold in half with the ingredients inside.  Sauce made from fresh ingredients, lots and lots of genuine mozzarella cheese and of course so many toppings, that you can't see the cheese  - all served piping hot... What you get at CPK is a very thin, hard, dry cracker-like crust that crumbles in your hand.  The crust is usually over cooked and shows signs of burning on some of the edges.  Then they skimp on the sauce, which may or may not actually have tomatoes in it.  They then apply what they consider to be ""gourmet"" cheese, which is usually everything BUT genuine mozzarella.  Finally instead of classic pizza toppings such as pepperoni, Canadian bacon, Italian sausage, anchovies and black olives, you get a smallish pie with foo-foo light and healthy toppings, which are about as appealing as a plate of alfalfa smothered in light ranch dressing.   It seriously reminds me of a giant overcooked Ritz cracker with some hors devours toppings on it.  And on top of that, it's extremely overpriced. For truly great pizza, go to Toppers, Roundtable or Rock & Roll Pizza instead.  Even Pizza Hut easily outperforms CPK and it's a lot cheaper and more fun...  They may not be as trendy or ""hip"" as California Pizza Kitchen, but your mouth & pocketbook will thank you for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-simi-valley?start=80
David B.,"Simi Valley, CA",4,26,1,5.0,3/18/2015,CPK doesn't serve standard pizza with cheese and sausage. It has a wide variety of toppings that are very tasty and actually the pizzas don't have much cheese. The service at the Simi Valley restaurant always seems to be good even when it's very busy. I'm reluctant to share this but I really like the fact that one can call ahead to put your name on the waiting list if you will show up in a few minutes. We do that every time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-simi-valley?start=80
Ed A.,"Montgomery, AL",2,56,1,1.0,6/17/2015,"Food was okay. Went there around noon. The waitress to customer ratio was appalling. The service was ultra slow. Each time we saw the waitress it took her 10 minutes in some cases to respond to our request. I observed the waitress and she was more than busy. I don't know if this was a one type of incident where they had multiple sick call outs or the manager is not managing this location. Whatever the issue is, it was not handled well. We won't be going there anytime soon. Pretty sorry situation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-simi-valley?start=80
Emily M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",8,22,2,5.0,2/11/2015,"This location is probably the best CPK I've been to! Mostly in part to our server Pedro.

Erin S.,"Washington, DC",84,70,37,2.0,12/25/2013,"Dropped in with hubby, kidlet, and my mom yesterday. Place wasn't too busy but it still took forever for our waiter to come back and take our order after taking the drink options. By this point kidlet was getting anxious and didn't want to sit for long, already bored with the crayons. The appetizer came out mere two minutes before the main dishes. Hubby's pizza was wrong AGAIN (see prior review) and the waiter tells us it is correct but hubby was pretty certain it said no bell pepper,yet there it was. After he's halfway through eating and having picked off the peppers, the manager comes over saying the pizza was indeed incorrect and brought a new one. The waiter tells us the recipe was changed recently to thin crust and a few things were changed with ingredients.  I'm fine with places wanting to go healthy but kidlet was mighty angry that her chicken didn't have fries with it. Can't really placate an already bored, starving toddler with broccoli. I heard several other kids near us complaining of the same thing. Menu was downsized and prices were not decent compared to potion size. Reminds me of a recent visit to Famous Dave's also at the mall, both restaurants seem on the way out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-simi-valley?start=80
Jessica F.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/11/2016,"I usually enjoy coming to cpk. Although this is my second time at this location, I have yet to have decent service. I've sat both at table and bar area. Seems like they only have one person working the bar area who also runs the tables. I waited over 5 min to be greeted, another 5 to get my water and another 5 to just order my appetizer. My waiter was def working hard running around serving other guest as well, yet I never got to place my order for my dinner. Guests who got there after me placed and received their dinner order and I had yet to place mine. At this point I've been waiting for 30 minutes. Only thing I received was my appetizer , water and Coke. I never got a refill when my drinks were empty. At this point I was already upset to continue to dine at this location. Maybe hiring more people would help offer better customer service.

Rodney C.,"Covina, CA",0,13,,1.0,5/14/2016,"I ordered a Chicken plate that was over cooked. It was 20 buck's so I expected something decent. Half the chichen was ok but the other half was dried out because it was over cooked. I let the waiter know and he asked me if I wanted to have it cooked more. I  said no thanks. He said ok and walked away. First time eating there and the last. Still left a decent tip because he did a ok job other than that. And my daughter is a server in a restaurant and I know they make minimum wage. My advice is to have management pay attention to food quality. 5 people over 100 dollars for a couple sandwiches a salad 1 small pizza, plate of crappie spagetti, and a chichen plate. 20 more dollars and we could have went to a nice steakhouse. I eat out a lot and I have to say probably the worst food I have had in many years. Olive Garden is one of my family's favorites.

Jessica E.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,5,,1.0,5/5/2016,"First time here, terrible experience, I felt rushed to order my food and ended up asking for something I was only iffy about as to not hold up my friend's orders. I asked for a small Mac and Cheese and the waiter told me there was only one size on the Mac and Cheese, this confused me because there was a Mac and Cheese listed under the ""small plates"" section of the menu but I said okay and the waiter took off. My friend then told me I should wave him down and clarify I wanted the ""crispy Mac and cheese"" from the small plates menu, so I spent 15 minutes trying to get his attention until he finally came over to adjust it. Once our food arrived, the crispy Mac and cheese was just 4 little balls of Mac and cheese fried and they were not good at all I didn't even end up eating them, extremely overpriced too. Once the waiter brought the checks everything was all mixed up, my friends lemonade was on my boyfriends check as well as my Mac and cheese, and they accidentally still charged me for the regular size. We pointed out all the mistakes and he went off to go fix it. 20 minutes later he comes back saying it's all been fixed and takes our cards. When he arrived with the receipts we noticed he charged my boyfriend's 23$ check on my friends card and my friends 15$ check on my boyfriends card. So they didn't even charge the right cards. By this point we were so disappointed with the service that we just left without adjusting the checks as to avoid waiting another 20 minutes.

Why on earth would I buy from CPK when Simi Valley has so many excellent pizza places? Ughhh. So incredibly disappointing. The worst Hawaain Pizza I have ever had.  The ""Canadian bacon"" was dry and honestly tasted like it was from a package or worse it tasted like turkey or something. There was no cheese to speak of. Just horrible. The sauasge, pepperoni and mushroom pizza was Al mushrooms and again where's the cheese?  So freaking bad.

Josh S.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/22/2016,"Let's start from the beginning here. We attended a fundraiser for our children's school. Made reservations days in advance. Showed up 10 min early and had no seats available as we sat waiting over 25 min we decided to ask to sit outside under a heater. After another 10 min we were seated outside. Our waiter was extremely slow, rude, and non familiar with any of the menu. After receiving our food, both children's dinners were cold, my mothers soup tasted like dirt, and my wife's pasta was not only ice cold but had no meat which we ordered in addition. After finally hunting down the server, we let him know the problems and his response was ""ok so do you want a new one or want us to reheat it for you"". Um, how about being a plate of food that's fresh and cooked. After many failed attempts of getting our food we asked for the manager. Who was very apologetic but didn't do much to fix the situation at hand except give us a gift card to return and give them another chance. Which is what we did. We just went yesterday and ordered take out. When my wife went in, she was greeted with extreme rudeness bc we were paying with a gift card. The manager came to help with the payment and did not acknowledge my wife at all. There was no bread in the bag so they got upset like it was our fault we wanted what comes with the order and said we can either wait or just take the food without it.

I come here for the pizza, the thin crust at that. They have a big brick stone oven that more then half of their dishes are made in.  For me, there's always those two types of pizza I always fall back on, my go to pizzas if you will. The thin crust spinach and artichoke one and the spinach and mushroom flatbread. I have also eaten a variety of other items on the menu, from pasta to salad to dessert. When in season their strawberry fields salad is a must along with their s'mores dessert in a jar !!  One more thing: Make sure to get the pizza dough rewards card, after racking up 100$ you'll get a 5$ certificate. And you don't have to eat just pizza to rack up the points, it's for all their meals.

We gave them the cauliflower back and chose we didn't want it anymore. They said they would adjust our bill and did not. So we paid for an appetizer we didn't even eat. I called after we left not realizing my husband paid for the appetizer and they offered a $15 gift card, but sadly it was my first and last time going to CPK so I refused I just wanted that $8 something back on my card, the funds cleared and they did not reimburse my card. It's only $8 but it's the point that matters, I shouldn't have to pay for something that we didn't consume. Horrible customer service, I couldn't find my waiter majority of the time, couldn't get a refill on drinks or on sauces, I will not be back.

Well this month is pizza month and the shrimp scampi pizza is back so we meet family for dinner and he got caught in traffic and missed dinner BUT I ordered him a scampi pizza to go. When he got home  he opened the box of what he called his shrimp skimpy pizza and he was a bit sad. He put the slices into the oven to warm  and I came along and cut off a strip of the pizza and nuked it just to have a taste. Well, this is not the shrimp scampi pizza I remember, I was horrified to find my mouth on fire! I mean real painful heat from spice, lips burning, tongue burning, throat burning, tears in my eyes heat. I know this cannot be right I thought it was a bad joke the chef or waiter played on us BUT then I went to the internet and it turns out this is a modified shrimp scampi pizza. My husband came to get his warm slices from the oven and I warned him to which he snickered and said yeah right, you are not getting me to hand over my pizza that easily. Well now he is downing his large glass of ice water. We both agree this is not the scampi pizza we remember from the past BUT we might be back one more time before it goes away on Nov 2nd and if we do, we will say no red hot chili flakes.  You all have been warned, if you do not like spicy heat in your food ""just say no to the chili flakes"". Other than that our entrees for dine in were as good as I remember, all enhanced of course with fresh shredded parm.

I didn't want to risk getting sick -- I explained that the pizza was our dinner, and I didn't think I should have to pay for an incomplete meal, where I would now have to go elsewhere and pay for another meal.

I had a concern, I was upset about what I felt to be poor planning on the Restaurants behalf, and the explanation behind it. I sent an email to Corp and posted a YELP review. I was not only called on the phone to dicuss, but received a very nice email recapping our conversation and inviting me back into their Restaurants. Bottom line is, they heard me, reacted and resolved!! That is enough to give it another chance....Thanks CPK for caring!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-simi-valley?start=60

Scott B.,"Canyon Country, CA",538,980,3113,3.0,9/19/2013,"I rushed to the other side of town to meet up with some co-workers for lunch here. I'd read about the place and saw that it was kinda pricey, and pretty wait-ey. Since I only had an hour lunch, and a ten minute drive on top of that, I did my best to mitigate both aspects.  After I read the various yelp comments, I hopped onto the restaurant's website.  I perused the 'online order' section of the menu, so I could figure out what I wanted ahead of time, and see how much it was. I briefly looked at the 'loyalty' club, but it seemed too little reward for filling out a ton of info about myself. They dangled a free small plate in exchange for filling out volumes to sign up for their list. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out what the heck a small plate was. Turns out at California Pizza Kitchen, 'small plate' = 'one size smaller than an appetizer'.       Also turns out the small plates aren't quite as pricy as the rest of the menu.  The small plates range between two and six dollars. The appetizers start around tenish. The meals somewhere around eleven and up.  I knew where my wallet was aimed at.  Since I foresaw a dinner trip to Del Taco for Taco Thursday, I figured I'd get something kinda healthy.  The Petit Wedge seemed like it would accommodate, and it also actually looked pretty good. A chunk of iceberg lettuce, sprinkled with bacon, tomatoes, and finally covered with a blanket of blue cheese dressing.  Just under three hundred calories per the website, and only four dollars and sixty five cents. Cheap, healthy, and tasty. Not quite the cheapest thing on the menu, but it was pretty darn close.      Waiter guy came for our drink orders, and boy were we ready for him. We hit him with our drink orders, AND our meal orders right there. BAM. Before he had even left with our orders, I asked for the check as quickly as possible. BAM number two.  Then we waited. The place was pretty packed. I guess there was a fair or something going on in the parking lot nearby. There were lots and lots of co-workers were in here. I recognized many badges dangling from clips, but I only really knew the small group of people at my table. As I waited for my salad, I nervously looked at the time on my phone, hoping it would make the food come faster.  The check came early as I had requested, and it was handled just about immediately so that I could eat and run back to work. After a bit more waiting, finally, at 12:47, my wedge salad was placed before me. I sighed as I realized I had about three minutes to eat it and get out if I wanted to stay on schedule to get back to my desk on time. I did my best to wolf it down as quickly as possible. Despite the speed-eating, It was really good. It was a good sized slab 'o iceberg lettuce, cold and crisp. The plate it came on was also cold and refrigerated. It was well presented, and I really wished I'd had more time to savor it. I ran out the door, and ran back to my car.     All in all, I was only a minute late. So not too too bad. I hate to have seen how late it if I hadn't been prepared. I felt kinda bad for being a jerk to the waiter. He seemed like a nice guy.  I may or may not be back? The salad was pretty darn tasty. I definitely won't be back on a lunch hour though. They are still kinda pricy, and despite my efforts, definitely still pretty wait-ey.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-simi-valley?start=60

Actually the server earned those because the food was terrible and earned no stars .  Kids pizza was the worst. Overcooked  , super dried out and very little cheese.

We had decided not to spend our money at this location about a year a go when our entire experience was really bad to say the least. However, that is the past and my review today is about the wonderful visit we had recently. The first noticeable change is the attitude of the employees. From the moment we entered the restaurant, the hostess provided a very genuine welcome, took us to our table and handed over the menus. Shortly after, the server, whose name I can't remember, greeted us with a warm smile and helped us with the menu. The food we received was excellent! I ordered the Chicken Picata and my guest ordered their smoky Salmon. Great presentation and flavor. During our dining experience, for the first time ever, a manager touched our table. We were very please to see this because in past visits, the manager is the cook and never comes out of the kitchen. I am not sure of their philosophy but it was a refreshing experience to see such change.

Kassandra B.,"Simi Valley, CA",24,13,1,2.0,11/16/2015,"Last night was my first time going to CPK, and I was very disappointed. My friend and I sat down and waited about 10 minutes for the waitress, when she arrived to our table she was very kind. We asked her what she recommended because it was our first time and she made a few suggestions, we ordered a pizza with cheese and tomato (I don't recall the name of it) and the 5 cheese ravioli. We shared both dishes once they arrived, and the pizza was okay, nothing to rave about. The ravioli was extremely disappointing, the sauce was decent, but the noodle had what tasted like bland ricotta cheese inside. I could have gotten ravioli at the grocery store for cheaper, and better quality ($14 for this dish which had roughly 9 noodles in it). We also got a free quesadilla, on the house for being first timers. It was pretty bland, not much flavor, but it was good for being free. When we got our check, we asked if we could split it and the waitress had a very fake smile when she said she would be right back. I work retail, I know how you sound and look when you're annoyed at a guest, she needs to be trained how to hide it better or something. But anyway, when we got our two checks back we gave her our cards wrapped in the receipts so she could tell which was ours. When we got the receipts back to sign, she had charged me for my friends purchase (which was 17 something as opposed to my 16 something tab) and my friend had only been charged $6.22 for some odd reason. We were so done at that point that we just tipped, signed, and walked out.  Thanks for the terrible service and nice discount!

We usually order CPK traditional dishes like Spinach Dip and Thai Chicken Pizza but at this visit we decided to order the Butter Cake for dessert and OMG this dessert is Super Good.  All I have to say is you have to order this dessert the next time you are at CPK.

If I would have wrote this a few months ago it would have been a 3 or 4 star review.  Last night my girlfriend and I went in for an earlier dinner (5-5:30) and the place was not all that busy. We were promptly seated 1 table in from the door. Our waiter (Matt) came over and immediately asked if we would like to move somewhere more quite and further back. Of course we did. So after he moved us to a much better table he took our drink orders and just as quick as we were seated we now had our drinks. Great and quick.  He then took our order which we wanted to modify some of the items on the menu which he had no problem doing. After taking our order he came back and said he had found a free ""small plate"" card and asked if we would like a free small plate. Who wouldn't want free food. So we tried the fried macaroni balls. They were delicious.  Then he saw we were finished brought us all new silverware and more napkins. Shortly there after he brought us our food which was delicious. I got the cheese ravioli and my girlfriend got some type of chicken pasta (I forgot the name) which I tried and was also very good. We have had the pizza there which everyone knows is very good.  All and all thanks to Matt for the great service and the kitchen staff for getting great food out quickly. This has become a place we are going more and more often!!

Theresa K.,"North Hollywood, CA",0,19,,2.0,9/26/2015,"These two stars are for our waitress and our bartender. The hostess and the manager should consider career changes. When a party of 7 (including a 2 year old) is told 15 mins to be seated and 35 go by and no one has approached them, what is the next natural thing to do? So I asked to speak to the manager. Why? What's wrong? The concerned server inquires. I explain, we were told 15 mins, that was 35 mins ago and there's an empty table of 4 and an empty table for 2 right next to each other and it has been vacant for about 8 mins... 3 mins later we are seated... The manager comes over. Has no idea of what has happened. So I explain. No apology, quite the contrary, he excuses the hostess' mistake, and was almost accusatory toward me that I was trying to make a problem out of a normal restaurant occurrence. It wasn't his 2 year old who was eating his own arm because he was starving... When is it ever in a businesses best interest to argue with an already pissed off customer who has a valid complaint. Guess this guy dropped out of Clown College (sorry to offend and professional clowns) cause it wasn't funny. Then our amazing waitress shows up, asks if we've had a chance to look over the... Oh wait, no one thought to bring menus. Better start studying online before you go to CPK in Simi... Our waitress, embarrassed, rushes to take our drink order and had asked a coworker to get us menus. We are approached and asked how many kids menus.... There were 6 obvious adults and 1, count him, 1 2 year old, eating his arm. 5 mins later still no menus. So my sister goes and gets us menus. Our waitress rushed bread out to us as we have now been waiting for an hour. The food took another 40-50 mins to arrive. I'm just confused about how 2 minimum wage workers know enough to apologize for the inconvenience and do their best to play catch up and the higher paid manager was rude, uniformed and condescending.  Just for the future CPK, an honest apology goes a lot longer then a jerky excuse and throwing $ at the bill. You can only buy so much loyalty.

Unfortunately though, the crispy thin crust pizzas  I believe you cannot buy frozen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-simi-valley?start=100
Reviewer O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,111,24,1.0,2/24/2014,"I wish I could rate this place with zero stars. The service was so poor that I will not only never come to this establishment again but all CPK's. The pizza isnt that great anyway. I along with two friends were excited to go to CPK, its used to be a great place to meet up and enjoy good pizza. However this time the service was so terrible that it was almost amusing. When we walked in, we were ignored for a good 5 minutes, mind you the restaurant was not busy at all and there was no one waiting. Actually the restaurant next door, Red Robin was packed. We should've gone there... anyway, after a couple of minutes Natalie (the host) greeted us, finally!  In the middle of asking us, ""how many people..,"" what I assumed was her co-worker, walks in and Natalie's face lights up and all of a sudden she is happy to be working there. Her co-worker chooses the table and server on the ipad and they walked away, giggling and making lovely conversation. Meanwhile, my friends and I are standing there in shock that we were completely ignored. We decide to stay despite the host's incredibly rude behavior... and boy was that was a mistake!  Our waiter seemed nervous, maybe his first day? We were not sure. Anywho, we placed our orders and the waiter accidentally dropped the plate on the other dishes with food making it splatter on everything including ourselves, oh but that wasn't the best part. When the plate landed on the other food he said, ""just eat it, its still good."" I couldn't help myself and bust out laughing. He thought the food that was half on the table and the other half that was on us was still good. Umm, is that a fetish or something?  I asked him to clear the table and please try again. I nor my friends had any plans to lick the table or eat off each other. I'm honestly still shocked that he would say that.  The second time was the charm and all the food managed to stay on the plate and in our belly's. Sadly, he really didn't check up on us after that; no refills, no ""how is everything?"", no service, or check. I actually went up to the manager to ask for the check.   Thank you waiter and host! You made for slightly amusing conversation and an eventful dinner.  Pros of this location, there is plenty of parking... and its probably because people are choosing other places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-simi-valley?start=100
Wesley E.,"Simi Valley, CA",9,53,2,3.0,4/21/2013,"Came here for lunch with the Mrs on a warm Sunday afternoon. We were seated promptly, the location was not busy, and the climate was refreshing and cool. The first thing I noticed is that since the last time I had been here, things have changed. There was a new app/rewards card deal, the menu had been simplified to one size fits all pizzas, and they have joined the craze of restaurants offering simple, cheap appetizers in the $3-$5 range.  For joining their e-club, you get a free 'Small Plate' which is their mini appetizer, so take advantage of that if you haven't already. The other 'perk' to their club is that if you spend $100, you get a $5 coupon. This is cumulative, and it's better than nothing, but I don't know how many people out there are so crazy about CPK that this deal is that pertinent, especially with the variety of dining in the town center, or pizza choices like Toppers still being around. Regardless of the e-club, the service was fast and friendly. We got our drinks ordered right away, and they never stopped being refilled. Their Arnold Palmer has always been one of my favorites, and on a hot day, it was doubly appreciated. The waitress gave us ample time to figure out our selection, explained the E-club, and explained that pizzas were 'personal' sized, 6 slice pizzas. I think that two people could get by on one pizza, and either a full appetizer, or even one of the 'Small Plate's.  We requested the Spicy Chicken Quesadilla for our Small Plate, and it was good. It came with a self proclaimed ""Ranchito"" sauce that I wasn't so fond of, but the quesadilla itself was good. For our main course we had the Pepperoni Pizza and the Habanero Carnitas pizza. Both pizzas were good, and the Habanero Carnitas pizza has the sensibility to come with the habanero salsa on the side. And do believe the menu when it says that this salsa is hot. I think I might have had a bad experience had it been on the pizza by default, and I love spicy food. The service was great throughout. When our main waitress couldn't get to us, we had two other girls swing by, one to bring out the pizzas fresh, and one to grab our drinks whenever low. Our waitress boxed up our food and made sure we were satisfied before bringing the check. The entire experience was good, not 'oh my god I must eat here often' great, and the food is a little pricey at $12+ a pizza.  CPK is in a weird spot, in that it kind of wants to be fancy, but it serves pizza. This is a problem I have personally with the idea of CPK, as opposed to something specific to this location. I think the CPK ASAP locations had the right idea, but I believe those are gone now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-simi-valley?start=100
Roxanne P.,"Simi Valley, CA",17,10,,4.0,5/13/2013,"Great new menu! I had not been to CPK in awhile. Not that I don't like their food, but just had fallen away from their regular menu. CPK has a few new items that are really worth trying AND are lower in calorie! Chile Relleno -  a new take on the chile relleno. Instead of being battered and deep fried, it's a pasilla chile that is roasted and then stuffed with a chicken cheese vegetable mixture. it's SO good. It's served on a plate with a little bit of their tortilla soup that is sort of like a sauce. The flavors in this dish are excellent!! AND it's about 380 calories. NOT BAD :-) The other dish that I'm a fan of is the Chicken Chimmichurri - grilled chicken with roasted vegetables (such as broccoli, cauliflower, and other hearty greens). The chimmichurri sauce was super. it had heat to it but lots of flavor. I always thought that was a misnomer - hot is hot.. but not with this dish. I highly recommend.  So if you're looking for some variation, try the new menu items!  Buen Provecho!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-simi-valley?start=100

Amy S.,"Simi Valley, CA",254,300,115,2.0,8/22/2010,I just dont get the hype. Im not exactly sure how people can compare this food to real Italian food.

Sunny R.,"Simi Valley, CA",2337,461,379,4.0,9/2/2009,We sat at the bar and ordered beers and a couple of appetizers to share.  Our server was fantastic.  We never lacked for anything during our time there.  He even changed the TV channel for us to watch a preseasn football game. The food was great and plentiful.  The beer was cold but could have been colder.  They only have 4 beers on tap so a larger selection would be a nice treat.   The only downside was the dreaded employee meeting that took place in the middle of our snacks.  It just leaves everyone in the restaurant hanging while the employees are hunched in the corner of the kitchen doing their Cheesecake Factory impression.  Can't those meetings be held before the restaurant opens?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-simi-valley?start=100
Blake B.,"Simi Valley, CA",3,29,,3.0,9/19/2013,"Total Rating: 3.5 out of 5. I can't give half stars, but there it is. I would give 4.5 if the pricing was cheaper, but alas this is for sure a ""spendy"" place for portions you get. I came after volunteering for 5 hours at the Simi Valley Days Fair for Special Children.  This place was PACKED.  I am giving 1 and 1/2 stars for the level of service we got.  I would like to state for good service I usually only give 1.  Service started extremely slow.  They obviously weren't prepared for how many customers were going to be coming in due to the fair, but they accommodated as time progressed.  I'm guessing maybe an extra server showed up or something. My friends ordered wedge salads and the fried macaroni and cheese balls dish.  The fried dish seemed a bit petite for my taste.  Especially considering the price.  For an adult with a small stomach this may be appropriate. This place is literally called California Pizza Kitchen, so I ordered a hand-tossed Pepperoni Pizza!  Let's see how good this pie is.   I would give it the same rating I gave this entire review.  3.5 out of 5.  It is barely anything special, but that by no means doesn't mean it was bad.  Same problem as others, for the price the sizing is a little small. The place looked and felt clean and ""fancy shmancy"" (Fake luxury... But in a good way). CPK: Keep everything about the place the same and either lower your prices or bulk up on the size of your dishes for more 4.5 - 5 stars I would suggest going here again.  I would not suggest this to pizza grease haters.  The pizza was a bit greasy.  I feel really bad for the guy who served us, but he did a fantastic job under the situation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-simi-valley?start=100

Cecilia R.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,102,113,4.0,1/9/2012,"Went here to share a few pizza's with family before going to Reagan Library. We expected to be ""in and out"" quickly and get to the museum in plenty of time. For some reason our food took forever to come. Over 45 mins! We were loosing museum time. We complained to the manager who was professional, corroborated our story as he knew when we were seated and took care of the situation by comping our meal. The food/pizza was excellent and actually the server was very nice the whole time. I don't know if he was overwhelmed by customers in the restaurant as were sitting on the patio (weather was awesome) or maybe he forgot to put in the order (being a waitress long ago I have to admit I had done this once or twice). We did loose time at the Reagan Library and pretty much ran through the exhibit. But luckily we live close by, but not the in-laws (they are from New York). But we left here happy that the manager ""stepped up"" and took care of things.  I hope this restaurant does well. It's new, clean, spacious and it has a nice patio seating area and most importantly.....good food.  We hope to be back and give it a second chance.

We stopped by here when we went to see Santa before christmas. We got the thai chicken pizza and the kids shared a cheese pizza with broccoli on the side. The kids menus were good and they colored to keep busy. While we waited my wife and I switched off going shopping.  Sitting outside was great because we didn't feel guilty when the kids got rambunctious. They have heating lamps outside to keep warm with and a full bar inside if you need to get warm that way.

Arvin S.,"Moorpark, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/21/2014,"I was at CPK at the Simi Valley Town Center yesterday with my mother and brother around 6pm and we were among the only people there. Our waitress was great, but I don't remember her name unfortunately. When we finally left, I accidentally left my Rayban sunglasses on the table and went shopping. About 15 minutes after we left the restaurant, I noticed my glasses were missing. I ran back to the restaurant and was greeted by the Manager, a tall big bald guy. He told me that they hadn't recovered any sunglasses but that if I left my name and number and description he would give me a call if they showed up. I left my info, but figured he was odd because he was keeping my by the door and seemed in a rush to get me out of the restaurant. So I left, and returned a few minutes later with my brother and walked right in to speak to my waitress this time. I asked her if they had seen my glasses and she said they did and that the bus boy turned it in to the manager. At this point I was confused. The manager came back to me and he asked ""can I help you?"". I responded ""I know I was just here but you said you didn't find my glasses but they couldn't have gone anywhere since I just ate here 20 minutes ago and the place is dead. My waitress said you have them."" He looked at her and then went to go get them. When he left, she asked me if he was being helpful. I said he was at first, but now I'm upset. He then returned with a couple pairs of glasses and said ""didn't you say it was black?"". I said ""no I didn't I said brown/tortoise, and I even wrote it down."" At this point it was clear to me that he tried to get me out of there before I could ask anyone else if they had seen my glasses. Such a shame that management would lie to their customers to keep their belongings. I spent over $100 on the glasses and he went through that to lie to me. So I would not recommend this restaurant because the management is very disappointing and shady. But I do thank my waitress very much for helping get them back. As for the big bald manager, I believe he should be fired immediately. Such a shame. Not management material whatsoever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-simi-valley?start=140

Johnny B.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,28,,1.0,1/29/2011,I dont like this place because they overprice everything. I often go to the CPK in Thousand Oaks and I always get the personal Hawaiian pizza. At the Thousand Oaks CPK the personal Hawaiian pizza is always about 8 bucks. I'm on a budget and my limit is not spending more than 10 dollars for lunch. When I went to the CPK in Simi Valley the same personal pizza was about 12 bucks. Why in the world would they decide that at one location the same item is 4 dollars more? This is the problem with the entire Simi Valley Town Center.  Some moron decided that they would make it into a place for high class rich people who can overpay for everything.
