David J.,"Singapore, Singapore",71,77,2,3.0,11/12/2016,"Not what it used to be. Very disappointing to see one of my favorite restaurants for past years go so far down hill. I hadn't eaten at this location for more than a year because of my last experience, but thought I give them another shot. Bad decision.  Last time it was service and food, this time service was okay, but food mediocre at best. Although, the service staff seemed to have a problem with English. That's a shocker in Singapore.  Biggest compliant is they no longer serve bread with meals. Although, the still have a bread plate. I've never seen a soup and pasta restaurant that didn't have bread on the menu. Soup is still good, but the pasta was dry and way too much garlic.  Sorry, CPK, it's Jamie's Kitchen next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-singapore
Luciana Y.,"Singapore, Singapore",73,131,230,3.0,9/24/2016,"It's been over 2 years since I last went to a CPK in the US, so I had the singapore one on my list as a place to satisfy my craving of the old memories.   sadly..as usual...things are never as good as you seem to remember them. I opted for the Milan thin crust pizza. it was just a thin and with that crisp edge that I love. the toppings had a good serving of cheese and sausage, yet somehow I feel like something was missing.  it was kinda bland. not much flavor. maybe the caramelized onions were not mixed in well. not sure...it just wasn't the same. or maybe the US ingredients are just different. either way, the pizza was decent...the drink was great - cold and refreshing..just what a cooler should be. just think it's slightly over priced...8 bucks for that glass..  I wouldn't say I've scratched CPK off my list....its just not gonna be on my top must go to places. it will be a ""if I'm in the area and craving pasta..."" place.  also..did CPK stop giving bread as a starter? or is that just a USA thing?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-singapore
adil h.,"West Newton, MA",0,3,7,5.0,6/28/2015,"There are not as many traditional american fare as one hope in a cosmopolitan city, but cpk comes as good as it come if you like the US menu pallate and portion size. Too bad waiters aren't quite trained and familiar with american condiments i.e., mustard, balsamic vinegar, etc Other than that, good place for those who wants chilis or aplebees alternatives",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-singapore
Sonia T.,Hong Kong,552,943,13,2.0,2/14/2016,"Definitely not like the CPK in the US, that's for sure.  I needed a quick somewhat healthy salad and had an hour to kill on a Saturday between appointments.  I sat at the bar, and ordered my usual, the Thai crunch 1/2 chicken salad.  No.  The salad was old looking, the chicken looked like it was either frozen, or came out of a bag somewhere, and the dressing was clumpy.  It looked like they at least make their pizzas homemade, but definitely stay away from the salads.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-singapore
Sudeep B.,"River Valley, Singapore, Singapore",28,105,186,4.0,2/28/2016,Nice find in Orchard road! Great spring rolls and good pizza plus a good wine selection! Nice cozy place with good service!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-singapore
ゆ,"Singapore, Singapore",0,40,,4.0,11/7/2015,"I love salad, so the volume and variety is salads they have is wonderful.  Pizza is average American Pizza, nice.  Pasta is above average - I think overall quite ok. サラダは日本人にとって嬉しいボリューム、味も悪くないです。ピザはアメリカンピザそのもので、いわゆるシカゴ（PAN）ピザとは違います。パスタも特別すごいという訳ではありませんが、美味しく食べられます。家族にはオススメできます。",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-singapore
Ashish C.,"Singapore, Singapore",0,74,,4.0,8/15/2015,"This is a place that is serving good food minus the pretentions that comes with most of the outlets these days. This is probably the first restaurant that started to serve gourmet pizzas like peking duck, chipotle pizza etc. Nice and if I can say healthier pizzas with lots of fresh vegetables. Servings are good and pricing is as reasonable as they can be. Cheaper than any of the places in any of the quays or dempsey. Will definitely be back and might make this as a regular place for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-singapore
Big R.,"Houston, TX",2,69,2,2.0,3/30/2013,"I ate here with my family again.  The last time we came here I ordered chicken quesadillas.  The so-called ""chicken"" quesadillas barely contained any chicken at all leading me to complain.  They gave me more virtually chicken-less quesadillas and some coupons so I could return and give them another try. That's what we did today.  We gave them another try.  I had chicken quesadillas again and, once again, the ""chicken"" quesadillas were practically chicken-free.   I can only conclude that this is how they serve ""chicken"" quesadillas at California Pizza Kitchen, with almost no chicken in them whatsoever. As God is my witness, I didn't know chickens could get polio.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-singapore
Yiling H.,"Singapore, Singapore",2,180,180,3.0,8/13/2012,"Went to California Pizza Kitchen for my friend's birthday celebration. We heard that they are good at their skinny pizza. Ambience was good, not too noisy, and they have 2 levels, level 1 and basement. We had a table at the basement and arrange a surprise birthday cake to be served to my friend.  We ordered 2 pizza to share with.  I love the unqiue sweet taste of the pizza. Something to do with the pizza dough, which i find it really nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-singapore
Roger W.,"Monterey, CA",0,2,1,1.0,5/8/2016,"Absolutely horrible. Extremely slow and caustic service, so so food, and hugely overpriced. Playing off ""California"" trendy wannabes. Avoid at all costs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-singapore
Joanna Y.,"Singapore, Singapore",20,50,53,4.0,7/17/2012,"To me, pizza is the kind of food that comes to mind when I'm stuck at home feeling hungry and lazy on a rainy Saturday night. This is until I head down to CPK for their popular wood-fired peking duck pizza. If you haven't tried wood-fired pizza before, I assure you this will be one of the best pizzas you've ever tasted.  The crust is slightly thin and crispy and filled with a hint of smoky aroma of the wood-fired oven. Topped with with duck slices, garnishes and crispy crackers, the peking duck pizza is one of the must-try dishes at CPK.  The ambience of the restaurant is pretty modern and cosy at the same time --Probably due to use of amber lighting. The staff's service, especially the branch manager's, is extremely good. The branch manager was very helpful and courteous in acceding to my questions and request for an extra serving of deliciously fresh guacamole dips.  What I have learnt from my visit: You have not tried real pizza if you've not try wood-fired pizza! (holds true at least for the ones at CPK) Must tries: Peking duck pizza, tortilla spring rolls",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-singapore
T P.,Australia,4,34,5,1.0,6/8/2015,"Slowest of the slow service, dry pizza and, somehow, $70 for 2 pizzas and 2 drinks. Added a service chare that wasn't advised on the menu. Avoid!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-singapore
Eric R.,"San Jose, CA",52,16,5,1.0,6/23/2014,"Says they're open till 11:30 but they close their kitchen at 10:30. Found this out the hard way. Suck it CPK. Try fixing your hours. If you close your kitchen at 10:30, then state that online and on the storefront and hostess table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-singapore
Andrew H.,"Lisbon, Portugal",122,576,111,3.0,1/13/2013,I think they took what is already a borderline mediocre chain restaurant in the US and made the portions smaller and the prices higher.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-singapore
Keikaikaoakua P.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,116,200,1.0,11/6/2015,"fair warning- 1 star for food n service. im from the US n do dine at CPKs. if the cpk corp evr found out how poor quality the food n service is at this location they would step in. the table of my left had them redo their steak bc it wasnt cooked well done as asked for. the table on my rt declined their appetizer bc it was burnt. yup, blackened crust. i was meetin a singaporean friend so i chose to meet here. i was embarassed. i was informed the avocado egg rolls werent available after the order was submitted. i was fine with it, but the spinach n artichoke dip was disappointing. the chips were straight out of bag n nt warmed up. at all 3 tables, entrees were served up even though all entrees were nt served to diners at the table. i ordered the roast duck pizza bc i was surprised it was still on the menu. in the US, it was pulled off about 7yrs ago saying the menu was updated to be ever changing with innovation. my pizza should haf bn listed as wonton pizza. this branch has done a dis-service to the cpk name. btw, no bread is served prior to appetizers",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-singapore
Ed P.,"Siglap, Singapore, Singapore",0,8,,3.0,1/14/2014,"An average review for an average tasting pizza. Had the Peking Duck and whilst different, it just wasn't that tasty. Also tried the pepperoni classic thin crust and I believe there wasn't enough meat on it.  Great atmosphere for a large group.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-singapore
Jeremy H.,"Singapore, Singapore",5,90,102,4.0,8/19/2012,"California Pizza Kitchen was a favorite restaurant of mine back when I was studying in the US. It reminds me of eating at Cheesecake Factory, it's a restaurant that you know serves good food. Not only good food, but good old American comfort food. Here in Singapore, California Pizza Kitchen has smaller servings compared to what they serve in America of course but what remains is the great tasting food and service. I've never ordered anything I didn't end up liking, that includes the Wild Mushroom and the Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage but I usually go for the pastas. California Pizza Kitchen is a great choice for group gatherings as the restaurant is spread over two floors and rather spacious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-singapore
