Josef G.,"Stamford, CT",0,40,,1.0,10/12/2014,"CPK embodies Mediocrity.  Seems like a copy of Cheesecake Factory that doesn't quite make it.  Wanting to avoid carbs, we went with salads ... one word: ""disappointing"" ... well maybe another word: ""expensive"", for what we got.  We could see ""Plan B Burgers"" outside the window; wished we ate there instead.  Would not go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stamford?start=40
Catalin B.,"Redwood City, CA",12,110,22,3.0,2/16/2014,"I love CPK in general and this place is no different in terms of taste. Unfortunately, as everyone else mentioned it does seem to be full of loud and messy kids. Perhaps because of this reason this location does not appear to be as clean as I would like it.

Mark P.,"Temecula, CA",17,271,11,2.0,11/18/2010,"The good thing about CPK is that they are consistant.  You have to ask for bread which seems strange when you order soup...but this is true of all locations.  Dining room is nice, clean and bright. The service was TERRIBLE!!  Dining alone is always rough because they place you in the worst tables possible.  My server was rushed and non-interactive.  I judge a restaurant on how often my iced tea goes empty.  Here it was never filled...in fact I wanted a refill and finally walked to the kitchen to ask.  I met the manager on the way to the kitchen and  I just simply asked if I could get a refill.  He said he would send the server out (now think about this for a moment why not just grab a pitcher of tea and fill the glass).  FINALLY the server came back and filled my glass and obviously he was not happy.  The manager avoided my table the rest of the evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stamford?start=40
Anne Marie S.,"Stamford, CT",66,8,4,1.0,3/28/2011,"GFDF (gluten free dairy free) rating - One star I used to love CPK as a family restaurant and would visit around once a month. A recent diagnosis of celiac disease - and associated dairy intolerance - has prompted a gluten free, dairy free diet, so my experience was very different on a recent visit. (We had planned to go to PF Changs, actually, but it was closed that day....) The waitress quickly gave me a gluten free menu and was very polite but kept suggesting pasta (which is generally gluten central, of course). Luckily I had my iPhone and could cross-reference the dairy free items on CPK's allergen chart - see   - because they could not provide me a dairy free menu or list. As I was cross-referencing the items, either I was taking too long to decide my order or maybe the waitress was just being polite, but in any case the manager showed up with a gluten free menu a few minutes later. I said I already had one but also cannot eat dairy. The manager then told me that I would be fine with anything on the menu that didn't list milk or butter. When I mentioned that the candied walnuts were listed on CPK's website as containing dairy (actually they list it as ""milk""), he said, ""oh yeah, they do have butter"" and walked away. This is NOT the level of service I was expecting.  In all, there is no longer much I can eat at this restaurant, and if I actually had a fatal or near fatal allergy (and no iPhone) I would have been in deep trouble given the poor level of training their staff! That said, I ended up having the arugula salad (with no cheese) and guacamole dip with corn chips, and while it was hardly a balanced meal they were both fresh and pretty yummy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stamford?start=40

Jay L.,"Wilton, CT",2,5,,3.0,7/9/2011,"Total times visited: 3 Rating Review Date: Wednesday, July 6th, 5pm Total Number of Guests: 3 Items ordered: Tortilla Spring Rolls (Mediterranean, Thai Chicken), Moroccan Chicken Salad, The Works Pizza Food: Presentation -  Limited use of common garnishes but all the items looked very appetizing!   Ingredients - I can tell that they were very serious about using fresh and selective vegetables.  I was disappointed with the thai peanut sauce and the sundried tomato sauce that came with the appetizer.  The peanut sauce had no resemblance to the actual southeast asian varieties and sundried tomato sauce lacked any aroma of sundried tomatoes.         Preparation - Moderate degree of technical skill is evident... pizza was sloppily put together but delicious regardless.  Surprising, tortilla Spring rolls did not feel greasy at all.  The Morroccan Chicken Salad was loaded with a bunch of dried sweet fruits which felt more like dessert; chicken wasn't memorable at all.   Service: Reservation - none needed for a slow, early Wednesday evening Initial Greeting - prompt and seated at the patio immediately.  My son received a set of crayons and coloring book right away.    Food and Beverage Service - We received limited personal attention at the table.  It took 15 minutes for us to have someone take our drink/me nu order despite low volume.  Had to seek attention for details such as high chair, extra napkins, refilling drinks.     Décor & Ambience: Entrance - Parking wasn't too bad this evening so we opted for the metered mall parking for 50 cents over the $5 for valet parking.  Difficult ramp access for disabled from the parking lot.  Reception stand was adequately staffed.   Waiting Area - One bench.  Design Elements - High level of refinement and sophisticated atmosphere.  I loved their open kitchen and the flow of the restaurant.   Printed Materials - Menus (not to mention tshirts) touting 'new' items was an overkill.  Interestingly, their menu encourages customers to try new flavors stating that they would replace it with something else immediately - very nice touch.  I wish I could have taken advantage of this for the appetizer and the salad but I did not want to interrupt our neighbors.     Chairs/Stools/Benches - We opted for outdoor seating.  The chair was too small for my comfort and I only weigh 180 lbs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stamford?start=40

Beware, there are inevitably kids galore -- is this the official birthday party place for Stamford? The food is good, not great -- triple AAA for consistency. Definitely not the best pizza in town, but not the worst either. If you can handle the kids and smarmy moms -- gulping their fruity drinks -- you will have an enjoyable meal.

Bina P.,"Stamford, CT",4,30,2,2.0,4/24/2014,I have been in this place several times because the pizza is good am not arguing that food is not good here.  I gave this place a 2 star because now the place looks torn up its worst then going to McDonalds they really need renovate the place and make it look like what it was before..  Another reason why I gave it two stars is the server was clueless like he was confused def needed more training especially in the restaurant industry.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stamford?start=40

It was my first time here and being a new stamford resident, i was ready to explore my new neighborhood's various restaurants.. Long story short, the food was pretty good but i'm giving 5 stars for the service we got. It was a busy friday night and they ran out of some ingredient and had us waiting for a lot longer than usual. The long wait was compensated with a pizza and soup and on the house by the kind manager! (Maybe the manager felt sorry for this pregnant woman twiddling her thumbs for the pizza to come out? ) The manager was so sweet & funny. We had a nice chat and a great time!

Patrick M.,"Cos Cob, CT",3,17,,2.0,3/10/2010,"When it comes to the California Pizza Kitchen chain, one thing is for certain, I will always be in love with their Thai Crunch Salad with Grilled Chicken and Avocado.   It was a regular lunch for me when I worked out in the studios of Los Angeles a few years back.  Healthy, fresh and delicious, it's the peanut dressing that makes this salad such a hit.  You need only order a half.  It'll surely be big enough to cure your hunger fit.  Add some of their fluffy white bread and butter on the side and you have a meal. Their pizzas are equally as good, but when it comes to calorie counts, not worth it.  Even though many of their salads including their Thai crunch are also high on the calorie meter, they're virtually carb free (unless you splurge with bread) and'll burn off much faster than that enormous personal sized pizza they serve you.  The southwestern avocado egg roll appetizer is a yummy starter if your appetite demands it and you don't mind the food baby effect afterward. I've been to a few other CPK restaurants throughout the country.  Orlando, New York, Boston, Los Angeles, but this fairly new outpost in Stamford, CT (literally almost a town over from me) was the only one that I felt in need of some serious reviewing.   When I first heard that a CPK was opening right in the Stamford Town Center in Stamford, CT I was more than excited.  I would now be able to order my favorite salad for a quick dinner after work.  The CPK of Stamford started out GREAT.  They had brand new interiors, a friendly new staff and of course...my Thai Crunch Salad.  All was well until recently... When you walk in, everything just smells...well...stale and of cleaning product.  Not something you want to get a whiff of the minute you enter a place where food is going to be served to you.  Moving on. Avocado has always been extra.  I've never agreed with it, but CPK has always charged an additional $2.50 to add Avocado to the Thai Crunch.  Yes.  $2.50.  It used to be that for the $2.50 you would get a generous serving atop the salad and it never bothered me.   On a recent visit, my avocado serving was ridiculously LESS than adequate.  I may have had about 5 small chunks on the whole plate.  So I asked the waitress if she could give me a little more.  At which point she said, ""We can, but we'll have to charge you more for it.  Everything is portioned.""  At which point she then added, ""Tons of people complain.""  Let me just say that I seriously doubt that they are ""portioning"" their Avocado servings.  If they are, it's a new recession special because this certainly didn't used to be the case. One would think that, with a lot of people complaining, they would rectify the problem and not TELL a guest that tons of people complain.  To say that I am disappointed is an understatement.  The Stamford, CT CPK needs to not skimp on the Avocado.  Period.  For $2.50, I expect an avocado tree.  Avocado police.  Get on it. I cannot easily recommend this particular CPK location to anyone.  If you're in a pinch and have a Thai Crunch obsession like I, it's worth it to take a 20 minute drive to the Scarsdale, NY location for better service and a fair amount of the Avocado you deserve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stamford?start=40
Melissa W.,"Stamford, CT",4,7,,4.0,2/27/2013,"I'm absolutely obsessed with their Moroccan Chicken Salad.  The full size is large enough to have dinner for 2 nights - so I usually eat half in the restaurant and bring the other half home.  I've never ordered delivery, but I have ordered pick-up a few times - service was pretty good...only problem is sometimes you have to wait for someone to notice you at the pick-up window (kinda minor).  Eating in the restaurant has been a good experience too...there have been a couple times where noisy kids were sitting nearby, but it is a family restaurant...and it only happened a couple times (again, kinda minor).  Overall, I keep going back for more...so it must be pretty darn good.  I'm not sure about the other items on the menu... :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stamford?start=40
Rachel A.,"Norwalk, CT",1,22,7,5.0,10/1/2013,"This is a review for the new gluten free pizza.  If you are gluten-intolerant in the Fairfield County area and you are missing pizza, and you just aren't in the mood for Fat Cat, THEN GO HERE.  I got their gluten-free BBQ chicken pizza. First of all: it's actually, like, the size of a pizza. I had to take home two slices, and I'm still stuffed hours later. This pizza is on POINT. The crust, which is made in house (it's not that icky Still Riding frozen business!), is thin, crispy (crust was crunchy, if that's not your thing then I'm sorry), chewy and awesome. Let me repeat that: the crust, which is gluten-free, is MADE IN HOUSE. Toppings were great, very flavorful. They have certifications from GIG (Gluten Intolerance Group) for safe, non-cross-contamination kitchen practices, and boy, did it show. Not only did my pizza come with a little plastic flag that said ""gluten free"" on it, but my server actually had to ask me to box up my own slices. Why? Because he may well have handled something glutenous at his other tables and didn't want to risk contaminating mine! Apparently this is company policy, as his manager advised him to do it. Super awesome policy!  The only complaint I've got is that it's pricy at 15.25 a pie, but I could have very easily split one pizza and a small salad with a dining companion, and gotten out with a full meal for two for under 30 bucks. They also have gluten-free stuff on their non-pizza menu (I spotted a caramelized peach salad that was GF and seemed like it would be delicious!). Excited to bring my Celiac'd SO here sometime soon for date night! We'll be back, definitely.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stamford?start=40
Paola C.,"New Fairfield, CT",130,234,19,3.0,12/2/2009,"Like any other CPK this one fits the mold... same interior, asme food, same craziness with kids. Unfortunately I came here on a bad day... after a trial run of the Thanksgiving Day parade in Stamford so of course there was no parking and there were children everywhere!  I had to valet my car (which I don't really enjoy doing) and then wait a while to be seated and for a waiter to come by.  I don't enjoy waiting after I'm seated even tho I do understand a busy restaurant.  As a waitress in the past, I always had time to at least stop by each of my tables to tell them I'd be right back to get them anything they needed.  The same did not go for our waiter, who it took about 20 mins to get waters. We had a quick lunch where I tried a new pizza... one with three types of mushrooms.  The waiter asked if I wanted grilled chicken, I distinctly said NO because I have not been in much of the chicken eating mood... what happened?  I got chicken on my pizza.  Luckily my bf loves chicken so I just picked it off and put it on his pizza.... but still not extra effort I wanted to take here.  After literally an hour or less lunch for 3 ppl we left.  The service and inconvenience of no parking was not worth the meal.  If you awnt CPK, I recommend doing takeout honestly!  Good part - as far as gourmet pizza's go, these are pretty good and they're pretty cheap.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stamford?start=40
Elizabeth P.,"Medford, MA",58,150,,3.0,3/8/2011,"We came here for lunch as a quick break from shopping, and overall the experience was pleasant enough. The food is by no means remarkable, but it's very acceptable. The interior has a generic, nice-enough feel. While I've passed by it when it's been mobbed (particularly on weekends), it was rather quiet today--most of the diners looked like they were either workers on lunch breaks or shoppers seeking to catch a quick bite. Our waitress was very friendly and the service was quite fast.  The menu consists of pizzas, salads, southwestern-inspired dishes, pasta dishes, and sandwiches. We both opted for the sandwiches, and they were very acceptable. I went for the chicken salad on a cheese-garlic focaccia. The inclusion of cranberries and walnuts into the chicken salad was a nice touch; however, I was less of a fan of the shredded iceberg lettuce served on it. It made the sandwich a bit of a mess to eat and didn't add much in terms of taste. The focaccia was tasty; however, the garlic and cheese that topped it was a bit overpowering (I enjoyed the bread, but it got in the way of tasting the chicken salad). My companion ordered a turkey club on the onion-herb focaccia, which seemed less overpowering. She found the sandwich to be tasty enough, but was more impressed with the cup of tortilla soup that she ordered with it (the tortilla pieces are sprinkled on top, so they don't get soggy). Overall, this was an acceptable, and relatively inexpensive, lunch spot. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but it's a good option if you're looking for a quick place to go around the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stamford?start=40

I like the selection of pizzas and the fact that they bring them relatively quickly. However, beware: the place can get pretty loud on weekends, because it is so perfect for the kids, and there are tons of families there. Also, order everything you want right away - after your waiter brings you the food, don't expect to see him or her ever again (or any time soon, at least). In this place, waiters seem to disappear into an abyss and it takes ages for them to check on you again.

Aimee A.,"Los Angeles, CA",182,500,26,4.0,1/17/2008,"I had never eaten in a CPK before. My family loves their frozen pizzas though, so when Stamford got its own California Pizza Kitchen, I was excited to try it out! About a week ago my boyfriend and I went to CPK for dinner. The location is fantastic - it's right in the new section of the Stamford Town Center (the mall). You can only enter from outdoors, and there is a garage right next to it and even valet service! We didn't take advantage of that (we're cheap), but for those who like it, it's nice to have. Other new restaurants here include P.F. Chang's, Kona Grill, Cosi, a fish restaurant (forget the name - sorry), and another soon-to-be-finished restaurant which is supposed to be really good! Anyways, back to CPK. My boyfriend and I got two different pizzas to share. I got the Wild Mushroom, and he got the Five Cheese & Fresh Tomato. We both LOVED the pizzas! They were delicious. We had a bottle of Fiji water with our meal, which was nice. I don't see a lot of restaurants that carry that brand! I got desert to go, because the Red Velvet Cake sounded amazing, and boy was it ever! I haven't had a desert so good in a very long time.

I suspect that people often put in bad reviews when it's a chain restaurant. But if one can put that fact aside for a moment and focus only on the pizza, I think CPK in Stamford offers a good alternative to Colony or Coal House or Outpost when you are in the mood for a slightly different pizza. Bear in mind, I do know how to enjoy good ""standard"" pizza, and there is no comparing CPK to Pepe's in NH, Lombardi's in Soho, Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, Patsy's in midtown, and Jonh's in the West Village. However, CPK definitely offers a different kind of pizza, and the crust is surprisingly chewy and good and the toppings very unique. Our favorite choices are the Greek Salad pizza, and the Carne Asada pizza which they may not have on their menu anymore.

Meenah A.,"Lancaster, CA",0,3,1,1.0,3/25/2017,"Came here on a vacation from California, and I was quick to realize why you should never dine at a CPK outside of California--service was HORRIBLE. My party of 4 arrived at 5:35 and we were seated promptly. Our order was also taken quickly, but that was the extent of our decent experience. 3 lemonades and a water, which took almost 20 minutes to arrive. Got our food at around 6:05, and 3 of us finished our food at 6:15. The waiter finally arrived back to collect our dishes (we hoped that he would refill the water too, but that didn't happen), and he quickly grabbed the 3 empty dishes and STACKED THEM in my 4th friend's plate of food that she was STILL EATING. He did not care to ask if she was finished, he just took our empty dishes and put them in her food, forcing her to be finished too. Rude and unnecessary. We asked for dessert menus (still with empty water cups) and he dropped them on our table without even stopping. He then took almost 15 minutes to come back and take our dessert orders, while we watched him serve other tables and make drinks for other customers who had arrived after us. Our dessert (chocolate cake and ice cream sundaes) were ordered at around 6:30, and did not arrive until nearly 6:50. When they came out, the ice cream was melted and the ""warm chocolate cake"" was cold. We asked for the check and set up our cards at around 6:45, and watched him as he walked around the restaurant with our booklets and cards in his apron until almost 7:00.  Terrible experience.

Asked the waitress for advice on what to order and her suggestions were great we had a pizza with beacon, lettuce, onion, mushrooms and cheese, the Ribeyes was flavorful and delicious, love love the avocado egg roll club and crispy Mac and cheese. It was nice that the General manager came to our table and spoke to us for a bit very nice person and asked if everything was to our pleasing. Yes it was.

Not sure about that one but anyways moving onto the food! When you walk in service is great, everyone is super friendly, ambiance is really inviting. The menu is awesome. They have a ton of options ranging from pizzas, to pastas, even some asian inspired dishes like dumplings. They do serve bread with lunch which i love. Our server Avril was awesome he was running the bar and serving at least five tables. He never missed a step. Prices were pretty decent. We got a pretty large pizza for about 16 bucks. I would definitely recommend the dumpling appetizer. Those dumplings were spicy and delicious! Food came out so fast too! Right when you were done with your water they were right there to give you another one. Bathrooms seemed pretty clean and nice too. The only thing I didnt really like was the blasting music, but other than that it wasnt bad at all!

Adam S.,"Charlotte, NC",15,361,3,3.0,12/20/2015,"I was asked if I enjoyed dinner after we were done (by my aunt, not a restaurant staff member), and I told her it was exactly what I expected. CPK is usually exactly what I expect, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. What I expect is average pizza and half decent service. That's pretty much what we got--the service was actually better than half decent, though. It wasn't too busy on a Sunday night, maybe 1/3 of the restaurant was full. I got a chips and guacamole appetizer and then the Thai Chicken Pizza. The apps took awhile to come out, and it was such an odd guacamole appetizer--there was enough guacamole for one or maybe two people. Usually it's enough for at least everyone in the table to get a bit of. It wasn't bad, it was just very odd. Anyway, to the pizza, which came out cold. It was fine. Peanut sauce was decent, could have used some more, veggies were fine too. I wouldn't get it again just to try something new, but it wasn't a bad choice. Our waiter was a tad slow but otherwise fine.

Came in tonight with my mom for my Birthday and we were sat right in front of their bar so their whole staff saw us sit as they were all hanging out and joking around amongst each other. The manager (im assuming because he was the only one wearing a different button down shirt) walked past us twice and never said a word to us, we never got greeted by anyone but the hostess and we decided to get up and leave after about 6-8  minutes no exaggerations there, and as we were leaving the manager and the whole crew were behind the bar just joking around and didnt say a word to us again maybe asking why we were leaving after being sat. I thought maybe the hostess would be up at the stand so i can communicate my frustration to her but she was not there, sadly I will never be back. All in all the service and condition of the restaurant was inexcusable as it was not busy at all, floor was dirty, tables had to go coffee cups on them throughout their dining room and the bar had scattered menus and more to go coffee cups laying around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stamford
Peggy M.,"Stamford, CT",0,35,3,3.0,6/9/2016,"So I've been at this chain in other cities and always had consistent reliable food. It looks like this chain location has fallen victim to what I call the ""Stamford Effect""- complacent, mediocre service with hum drum food. I came in on a Thursday and sat at the bar. Because I was ignored by the hostess. My favorite beer was not available as the taps were cleaned the night before and the solution was still in the lines so no beer on tap.  Ummmm...say what? That's some bullshit right there. Ok- so ordered one of their signature drinks and it was very good. Except a server was yelling behind my back to tell someone in the kitchen to clean the outside tables. Ugh. Why hasn't this girl been trained not to yell over patron's heads? I then had one if my rave faves at this chain- the California  Cobb salad- delish. Except the bar reeked of garbage- it clearly hadn't been emptied. The bartender told me it's emptied every night. Yup- I'm sure it is. But when I can smell rotting garbage at 2:00 in the afternoon they probably need to empty it more often right? Or scrub the bins. Or something. Because ewwwww... So the bartender is a sweet girl but untrained- I had to pour my own beer into the glass with no napkin or coaster. Just a sorta meh experience with obviously poor management as job duties don't seem to be clearly assigned and more training is needed for all the staff. Maybe they'll pull their shit together but until then? I don't recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stamford

Then we finally got sat down, and took forever for our drinks to come. The manager came by and served our drinks. No bread or plats. Then after we ordered our food we questioned why everyone before and after us were seated. The person gave us such a bad attitude. And 10 minutes later we were told one of our entrees were not available. It was only then the person apologized. Horrible experience and would not return. We were offered a free entree as the result of all the wait. Was almost 90 minutes when we got our drinks from the moment that we arrived.

Every single one of us got very unhappy during the dinner. And we became angrier and angrier because of the waitress and manager's attitude.

Second time: Asked to order an appetizer and substitute the pita bread with flat-bread. (their own website said this is a vegan alternative) The waiter was very confused and could not figure it out. I then asked for a pizza without cheese and was finally told he could get the Artichoke and Spinach pizza. Just as the pizza is coming out, the waiter says there might be cheese in the spinach sauce. I said that I'm allergic to cheese, but he said ""don't worry, there's not much cheese in it."" I was kind of ticked off, but due to time-contraints, I couldn't just go back and wait for another order. The pizza comes and there's clearly a lot of cheese on it. Very displeased with the service, but thankfully I did not get sick from the pizza. All in all, the quality of the food is good, but service can be inconsistent.
