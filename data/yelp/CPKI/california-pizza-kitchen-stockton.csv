ramona v.,"San Francisco, CA",6,18,2,4.0,5/4/2009,"I love this place. when I visit this is usually where I will meet my mom for something to eat. the last time I went there their portions had shrunk, which is unfortunate. same great hummus and salads though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stockton
jamie b.,"San Francisco, CA",24,115,2,4.0,1/17/2009,"California pizza kitchen how i love thee... one margherita pizza please. So my mom and i ventured in here yesterday and we are no stranger to the cpk. our server was excellent, even prior coming over to our table he went over to the windows and adjusted the blinds because the hostess sat us right by the door and there was a ridiculous glare off of the cars in the lot. she and i always split a margherita pizza and then get a half salad. (i think their prices have gone way up because even a half salad is ridiculously over priced. i recommend that they get just a traditional dinner salad on the menu that should be just a a few dollars is paired with a pizza. perhaps i should take it up with corporate) i have one small complaint which is why they did not receive full scoring. it took forever for our salads to come out to the table. i think we sat for a good twenty minutes. once they did arrive, they did not disappoint. but about 2 minutes later our pizza arrived. so instead of having time to enjoy my salad, i stopped to eat the pizza while it was still hot. so they need to work on their timing. will my disappointment prevent me from returning? NEVER... i love that margherita pizza with it's thin crust.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stockton
Joan T.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,146,10,3.0,6/22/2008,"What did I say in my BJ's Brewhouse review?  Oh yea, that not all locations of chain restaurants are created equal.  Hrm, and well, that definitely applies to this CPK.  (That's California Pizza Kitchen for those of you who aren't down with the lingo.)   But CPKs in general are one of my favorite restaurants.  Their menu is pretty extensive and everyone can usually find something that they like.  My favorite salads are the BBQ Chopped and Waldorf Chicken.  If I'm feeling like a pizza, the Pear Gorgonzola and California Club are both good choices.  Opt for the Honey Wheat crust, it's tasty.  And the Hot Fudge Brownie Sundae is absolutely delicious and worth every calorie.   Minus 2 Stars for two reasons.  First, the couple times I've ordered Take-Out late at night, they've run out of bread.  Yea, that was pretty whack.  And at this location, there is a certain waitress who's been there for years who seriously has an attitude problem.  Someone should remind her she's waiting on us here..   Oh and a couple of tips.  If there is a wait, there is open seating at the bar if you don't mind that.  And Pacific Students and Faculty enjoy the ASUOP discount of 20% if you show your ID.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stockton
Sara H.,"San Jose, CA",13,52,12,4.0,1/20/2009,"We went to CPK over the weekend while visiting my dad. We were seated right away even with 2 kids and needing a high chair. We went mid afternoon on a Saturday. It wasn't busy despite being in the mall. Our server was there right away to take drink orders. This isn't your run of the mill pizza parlor. These are designer gourmet pizza's. My favorite is the white sauce with garlic and chicken. As far as I know pizza's only come in 1 size. It's about 6 really decent sized pieces. A guy could probably finish one himself but my fiance and I were sharing one.  They came fairly quickly and were perfectly done. The kids were happy with their pepperoni and coloring books. CPK is great for something different when it comes to pizza. I'm also a fan of their frozen pizza's in the grocery store. I love CPK, I will definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stockton
Sarah K.,"Garden Grove, CA",10,150,,2.0,5/21/2008,Service is sketchy and often disappointing.  Moar water refills.  Moar drink refills.  And less reminding of crap that I asked to get.  I just want consistency... The food varies also.  Sometimes it tastes fresh and others stale.  I really don't know how else to describe it.   And despite all of this I would have given it a higher score except for the fact that the last time I was here somebody took a shit in the hallway to the bathroom...which consequently was right where we were seated.  And they didn't feel like moving us apparently. eh.  I haven't gone back since.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stockton
John S.,"Stockton, CA",0,1,2,5.0,1/11/2010,"My favorite place to have a nice simple dinner. Both the Waldorf Chicken Salad and BBQ Chicken Pizza are my most favorite along with the chicken dumplings appetizer. I was so happy to see one in my home town when I moved back after 12 years in Los Angeles, but I am saddened to hear they are closing this Stockton, CA location in Feb. The nearest one will be 50 miles away after that...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stockton
Wel C.,"San Francisco, CA",16,121,48,4.0,8/17/2006,"I have almost a weekly affair with CPK (as we regulars call it )every Sunday morning. The staff is friendly, the food comes fairly quickly, the portions are great and the aromatic sensation of the food is wonderful.  All these things make it a great place.  Almost unheard of for a chain. Love their gourmet pizza !  So decadent !  You can't go wrong with any of them. I also am addicted to their BBQ Chicken Salad.  If you decide to order a salad, all you need is half unless you're planning on sharing with a friend. Come by Sunday around 11:30AM.  You may see me there enjoying my salad or pizza !  =)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stockton
Lauren S.,"Stockton, CA",497,702,13,4.0,1/30/2009,"Every time I come back home, I have lunch with my grandma here. She just loves the barbeque chicken salad, and she lets me know about  fifty times. I always get the pepperoni supremo. The service is usually pretty good, unless you get a newb who doesn't really know what they're doing and give you terrible service in the process. Also, I got the red velvet cake today since I was feeling particularly fatty today, and it was delicious and was like what sex should be. Smooth,rich, and keeps you coming back for more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stockton
Charlie O.,"Waukon, IA",776,1198,210,4.0,12/22/2008,"Have eaten here a couple of times. The food was always good, hot and tasty. Sometimes the service was slow but then take into consideration that the place was packed. I just don't have much patience. lol. I like just about everything they have on their menu. Will definitely go back when I'm in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stockton
Emily S.,"Stockton, CA",286,904,829,4.0,9/11/2006,"I really enjoy CPK.  This one, in Stockton has a more extensive menu than the one in Pleasanton.  The service is always good.  And the food.... oh the food.... I'm hungry now.  Darnit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stockton
Ed B.,"Stockton, CA",6,37,,4.0,10/27/2009,get the bbq chicken pizza...its the best one. but i think everything has been good from there.the only down side is i need more food. but it is enough for most people.enjoy,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stockton
Chloe S.,"Stockton, CA",0,10,,4.0,7/27/2008,"I love the salads and the pizza! The Tostada pizza is the best! The service is usually fast, they are friendly and it's obvious they focus on cleanliness of the restaurant. I would go there more often but my hasband isn't a huge CPK fan....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stockton
Jay S.,Bay Area,107,247,10,5.0,3/10/2008,I love their garlic chicken pizza! They also have excellent lettuce wraps and the salads are good too. I like the fact that they do curbside to-go orders but they only have two parking spots and the bastards shopping at the mall will usually park there because it's close to the entrance. Just pull in to the alley next door and give them a call...they don't care where you're parked.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stockton
Lisa A.,"Sacramento, CA",16,97,6,4.0,11/28/2009,"went here after a day of thrifting. outstanding service. our server hooked us up with a couple samples of complimentary wine and allowed us to order off the kid's menu. there were four of us at the table and for dessert, we shared a turtle sundae. our server came out to update us after ordering that it was on its way after a fresh batch of whipped cream was done. when it came out, you could tell it was super fresh. and...whoa! it was huge. although only 3 of the 4 of us indulged in the sharing, it still took forever to finish.  clean with a nice atmosphere. only downfall was that it was attached to the mall. seems like most of them are like that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stockton
Chatree T.,"San Francisco, CA",36,198,82,3.0,11/22/2007,"I ate here before and the second time around wasn't as great as the first. This time around they served us old greens for my waldorf salad. The California Club pizza wasn't that good as before. I enjoyed the raspberry mojito and service, so 3-stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stockton
Honey B.,"Oakland, CA",261,240,184,2.0,8/4/2006,well all i can say is i give them an a for creatvity but the food was horrible i mean call me old fashion but i like my pizza with no mayo.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stockton
