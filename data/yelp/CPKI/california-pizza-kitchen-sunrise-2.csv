Marilu F.,"Hialeah, FL",352,510,2129,4.0,10/25/2017,"As a college student, I used to love heading home on weekends and going to California Pizza Kitchen with friends. Now post-college, those days are rare and very much missed. In fact, given all the options now, it is saying something that I even remember this restaurant. More so, more shocking still is that I still love it. I find that to be flabbergasting as the majority of restaurants I loved five or six years ago, I absolutely hate today. That said, we ended up at this location when we went to Sawgrass Mills. The weekend before we had gone to another mall and regretted not going to California Pizza Kitchen, so this was our first stop when shopping. Going to the restaurant reminded me greatly at how wonderful the food tastes. When we entered, my boyfriend and I had no wait whatsoever. As we sat, I admired the airy and open feel of this location. It was my first time there and I must say I may admittedly prefer it to the one I used to frequent down in Coral Gables. At any rate, I am pleased to say that this chain is consistent. Good service, great food, the works, regardless of location. That's a win-win in my book. Ordered water and strawberry lemonade as our drinks. I had the lemonade admittedly and it was a bit sweet but nevertheless refreshing. We munched on freshly made bread and oil, while we waited for our pizzas. Boyfriend ordered a pepperoni one, while I had the signature BBQ chicken pizza. Pizza was personal size, but I found it huge. I took half of it home as leftovers. My boyfriend, in comparison, inhaled all of his. Debated dessert but skipped it. Paid and we were on our merry way. All this was less than $40, which is a great deal. It could've been better though. I had a coupon for being a rewards member and it said $10 off $40, but we just didn't reach it. Oh well; maybe next time, and even if it goes to waste, goodness knows that they send out plenty of rewards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2
Angela M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",169,166,2783,1.0,1/8/2018,"After last Friday's dining experience, I have to update and downgrade my review for CPK. What was once a decent chain, is now YUCK! We came on a recent Friday, were seated right away, and had the worst service.  Once we were finally able to order waters and a round of beers, we waited for our beverages. It was passed 20 minutes and we literally had nothing. We then ordered our food- a petite wedge to start, and a pizza each. We received our salad, but still no beer! Whyyy?  We finished the salad, asked twice more about the beers, and finally received them at the same time as the pizza. Honestly, waiting in excess of 15 minutes is crazy for one round of draft beers for two people. On top of that, the food was not so great. My California Club pizza had over-cooked chicken all over it. We asked for refills on waters, over and over, and finally got one refilled after we received the check.  Never coming back again! So long, CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2
Sam M.,"Boca Raton, FL",480,281,2420,4.0,11/1/2016,As a CPK Preferred customer once in a while you get some good deals in your account. One of the 10 off 40 was siting in my account for almost a month and was about to expire so we took this opportunity to eat some tasty CPK pizzas. Usually I hate to eat at sawgrass as the service is below par but on this trip the weather was amazing and we were able to sit outside and I can say the service was very good. We were sat immediately and got a great outside table. Our server promptly took our order and we were munching within 15 minutes. We ordered the California veggie and a unique tortilla pizza called the tostada.  I also ordered the mango lemonade and if you have read my previous restaurant reviews I usually get a lemonade. Now the lemonade wasn't as good as the ones you find in Budapest but they did ok. The pizzas were yummy and we had left overs which we enjoyed the next day. We also ordered the brownie with ice cream along with great service we finally were able to redeem sawgrass as a place worthy to eat while you are there shopping.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2
Kara M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",272,648,3116,4.0,2/28/2017,"I've been here 3-4 times since moving to FL last summer.   I was a big fan of CPK when I lived in California since it was next to impossible to find good pizza on the west coast.  Also, while in pet friendly CA, we learned that this chain would typically allow pets on the patio and since we were often traveling with our small dogs that worked well for us as a sit down meal option.  I don't believe this location allows pets on the patio, but the one in Boca Raton does.    I now live in South Florida (with other ex-New Yorkers) and I'm fortunate enough to have found some non-chain pizza joints.  I prefer an authentic mom and pop made NY style pie, but CPK is more of a gourmet type of pizza.  If I'm coming here, I love doing so at lunch time (Monday-Friday).  There is a great lunch special and menu, I would say you will get the most bang for your buck that way. I recommend the lunch size pizza with a side salad, it's the perfect portion size.  We stopped in here tonight since we had a gift card left over from Christmas.  We were seated by a friendly woman.  Our waiter quickly appeared, we put in our drink and food order.  We weren't asked if we wanted bread, which is ok since we neither of us was super hungry.  I always wonder how they decide whether to ask you if you want it, but keep this in mind incase you are ravenously hungry. Our food was fresh and tasty.  Took a little while to get refills on our waters, but not the end of the world.  The waiter did ask me for my CPK rewards card info, so I was happy he remembered that.  We didn't order desert tonight, but I recommend the butter cake with a scoop of ice cream.  It's the perfect size to split, it's a good size. Prices have gone up a bit at CPK, so I think that's why the weekday lunch special is the best deal here.  This restaurant offers inside and outside seating.  Nothing beats outside seating on a warm Florida February night!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2
Chelsea S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",107,6,1,1.0,1/6/2018,"Baked Potato Soup & Chicken Club Sandwhich  very nasty , i had to take the sandwhich apart because the bread was very old and hard.

Faith K.,"Plantation, FL",222,131,107,4.0,3/6/2017,"Stopped in on a Saturday night after an early movie.  The place was crowded but we were seated in less than 10 minutes.  I ordered the Thai Chicken salad and my friend ordered the lettuce wraps.  The server soon brought some fresh bread.  After the order was placed and the bread had arrived, I asked our server, Edward, if he would order me a Moscow Mule and he did.  About 5 minutes later, maybe 10-15 since we were seated, our food was delivered and Edward immediately apologized that the food came before my drink.  I told him don't be silly.  The timing was perfectly acceptable.  My salad was very good and my friend said her lettuce wraps were great.  Note to self to try them next time.  My drink was good, but pricey. As much as I detest the Sawgrass Mall, I would certainly return to CPK and ask for Edward.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2

Natalie A.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,5,,3.0,5/19/2017,Reason I gave 3 stars: I noticed a waitress who was handling food without gloves.

Jonathan A.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",277,93,373,5.0,3/20/2016,"I sat at the bar for this visit. The restaurant was clean and airy which I like in a restaurant. The bartender Brett was friendly and attentive to me.  I ordered the Manhattan, which every bartender worth his salt should know, and the Sicilian thin crust pizza. Brett promptly made the drink and it tasted how it should taste.  The pizza came about 15 minutes later which was a little faster than I thought but was nice surprise.  The Sicilian was delightful spicy but not overwhelming.  The crust had good crunch to it and cooked to perfection.  If you come here go to the bar and ask for Brett and he is not there Cindy is great as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2
Lydia K.,"Sunrise, FL",0,50,81,3.0,10/8/2017,"Made another visit and we were given a table and seats that were dirty. We stood and waited while the busboy cleaned the table and wiped down the seats. Mind you, they already placed the new silverware down before we got the table. So either someone isn't doing their job or their not being very stringent with their cleanliness protocols. Ewwww! We were sat near the kitchen, so things were kind of loud. Our waiter was just okay. Timing wasn't his forte. The food was okay. My son had the Margherita Pizza and I had the chicken dumplings and the chicken lettuce wraps. They were fine. Overall, the visit was not up to par from the beginning. The hostesses should always check the tables to make sure everything is fine before seating anyone. So, that set the mood for a not so wonderful meal. The floors throughout the restaurant had straw papers and stuff strewn about. Will leave my rating to three stars because I know this place can do better than this. Come on guys!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2

Jordanna E.,"Plantation, FL",406,321,1853,3.0,12/21/2015,"I went recently and must say I was impressed. I went because it was a fundraiser for my school. I hate pizza!  My kids had the BBQ chicken pizza and it was great. My husband had a personal pizza and it was great but a bit pricy for the size of it.  I had the chicken piccata, which was recommended by the server. It was a flavorful dish and I would get it again. Kids had sundaes that were only .99!  Service was great. Restaurant was clean and beautiful but no ambiance. It was also very slow all night.  I'd go there again for sure, but with all the choices near this location I'm not racing there tomorrow.

Keyla A.,"Miami, FL",25,72,73,1.0,8/24/2017,"We ordered three dishes, pizza and two pastas. Nothing good the food, and to top it off, we spent the scare of our life. We ordered the pasta dish similar to the Thau and placed a few small red chili peppers that we thought were dried tomatoes , I bit the tip of one of the chiles and I was dying , I got the tension, I started to Shake and my tongue felt like i was swelling, I thought I was going to die. The manager of the restaurant brought me milk. I almost die in that Restaurant. Never go to this place, even if you leave Sawgrass Mills Mall starving. Of course!

Sharai R.,"Miami, FL",288,122,510,5.0,10/18/2015,"TIP: join the rewards programs...good perks! You get a free small plate when you sign up but also in the month of October, they are offering $10 off of $40 spent. PRO-ample amount of seating, friendly staff, good menu We've visited twice in the past two weeks and both times left us wanting more. This particular CPK has a nice ambiance and a great staff. All the staff are welcoming, warm, friendly, and are very familiar with the menu. Both times we visited our waiter was fantastic. The first time we sat inside and the second time we sat outside on 10/17/15 around 5pm. When we sat outside, it was brought to our attention there was only one waitress for all the tables but it was not noticeable. She was on top of all the tables and serving all of them with a smile and excitement. We ordered the spinach mushroom flatbread for the 2nd time because we loved it so much the first time. We also ordered the shrimp scampi pizza after our waitress mentioned that it is her favorite pizza. Both pizzas once again did not disappoint. My favorite part is when they grate fresh parmesan on your pizzas. YUM! We also ordered Funky Buddha Floridian beer, Abita Purple Haze, and the Agave margarita. They have an extensive drink menu with many craft beer offerings. The agave margarita was limey and strong. I was pleasantly surprised. For dessert, we ordered the Salted Caramel Pudding and the red velvet cake. The red velvet cake was mediocre but the ice cream served with it was perfect. More importantly, the Salted Caramel Pudding was SOMETHING ELSE! The pudding came in a mason jar. The bottom layer contained chocolate cookie-like crumbles. The second layer was the pudding then came a mound of whipped cream drizzled with caramel. I put my spoon in the jar and immediately soared to dessert heaven!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2
Toomie M.,"Miami, FL",18,148,90,1.0,7/10/2017,"I have never been more disappointed in an experience like I was today. It was more like how fast can you order everything you will need your entire sitting with your server because she isn't going to ever come back. Other than the fact she is going to only ask if you want the bill next time you see her. I wanted more drinks since they were empty the entire time. I wanted to order more food never had a chance to, overall terrible lunch!! Then when I told her I wanted to order a bunch of more food and drinks she just says I was at the party on the other side??

Between the 4 of us we ordered 2 cappuccinos, a butter cake and a strawberry shortcake. The cappuccino were excellent. The butter cake was SUPER RICH, way too rich for my taste but others in my group seemed to love it. The strawberry shortcake was by far my favorite.

Carlos B.,"Plantation, FL",224,116,857,4.0,12/1/2014,"I woke up tired the day after Black Friday knowing all I wanted to do was sleep in, stay home and have a lazy day. But that turned into my girlfriend convincing me to go shopping. I knew at that point the crowds were going to be everywhere and I decided that I would need good pizza to kick off the day. Since we were headed to Sawgrass Mills Mall, I decided to skip on all the other pizza places we have in the area and go for California Pizza Kitchen. I have not been to a CPK in probably five years so I was excited to finally go there. I guess I never realized that they also had a full service bar. Their cocktail menu looked pretty appetizing and I had a hard time choosing what I wanted. I decided to go with the Citrus Adobo Margarita. Being a Margarita lover, this was definitely a Hit and I would go back to CPK just for that drink alone. It was sweet and tart, spicey and sour on the finish. The Pizza menu looked good. Some of the classics were still around like the Original BBQ Chicken Pizza and Thai Chicken Pizza. For some reason, I was craving their BLT pizza but was sad to see it was not on the menu any more. I should of asked but did not get a chance to, I got distracted reading other things on the Menu. I settled for the California Club which sounded like a ramped up version of the BLT with chicken on it. It featured Nueske's applewood smoked bacon, roasted chicken, mozzarella, arugula, basil and avocado. This is a new establishment in the Sawgrass Mills Mall Oasis strip so the place was clean and nicely decorated. They had plenty of seating available at 1PM on Saturday but seamed like they had enough space for the busy hours. They offer Patio seating, curbside pickup and online ordering. I will be for sure coming back in the near future and trying different pizzas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2?start=40
Tatyana R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",7,24,32,5.0,5/23/2015,"This place is great! Friendly, fast and attentive service, great food, drinks and desert. Management is always around, checking on your level of satisfaction and quick to fix any issues that may come up. And for what you get, prices are very reasonable. In my opinion, out of all CPKs around, this is the best location. It's fairly new, just a few years old so design is modern and Cali casual, very comfortable and relaxing. It has both indoor and outdoor seating that can accomodate small or large parties.

But the quality and freshness I've come to expect were completely absent. I had the corn guacamole and the fish tacos. This is not the usual guacamole, which was fine, but it barely had any taste, the little bit of avocado in it was in little chunks, and had that off green color that says it wasn't even close to fresh. It also had none of the flavors of guacamole--no onions and no lime flavor. The fish in the fish taco although fried, was flavorless, dry, and that off color that says not fresh fish!  If this was the first CPK I visited I would never go back.  I saw the place was a bit empty, but I tried it because of my past experiences!

It's a chain operation but the food doesn't have that chain blandness.   Let me say again the service was fast and polite.  My friend had the espresso and said it was very good.  I'll take his word because he's a coffee lover.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2?start=40
Christie J.,"Oakwood, FL",197,27,26,4.0,1/25/2015,"I've heard about California Pizza Kitchens foreverrrr and honestly expected them to be comparable to fancy Pizza Huts so I never gave them a try... I found out last night that I was wrong.  I'm not going to say that they are better than mom & pop's pizza parlors, but I did enjoy my food.  Ordered the Caribbean sunset sangria in a carafe, which was absolutely delicious. Our glasses came filled with fresh mango, blueberries, and apples, which were nice to eat as a sort of dessert after the meal.  As for the pizzas, we ordered The Works on flatbread and the original White Pizza. The toppings portion of the white pizza was pretty good, the crust was phenomenal! Wow! The works was soooo yummy, they used good quality pepperoni and sausages which made all the difference. It was delicious on the flat bread, but next time I'd like to try it on the original bread.  The service at this location was great. They accidentally brought us a mushroom pizza instead of the white pizza and when I sent it back, the deliverer not only apologized but he sent the manager over to do so as well. Great customer service. And Mel, our waitress, was very sweet.  ONLY DOWNSIDE: In my honest opinion, everything was a bit overpriced.

Brenda D.,"Mississauga, Canada",35,67,114,4.0,12/5/2014,"The Good: - we walked up to the host and asked to see the menu. He was very friendly and explained some of the options. His personality was one of the reasons we decided this restaurant vs the conveyor belt sushi inside the mall - the same positive host allowed us to pick our spot in the restaurant so we chose one near the windows - the menu had a lot of variety and some items I had never seen including Kung pao spaghetti and Korean BBQ pizza where every dollar of the sale goes to charity  - our server, Nikki, was also really friendly and awesome. She definitely helped with the 4 star rating. She refilled our drinks (mango lemonade and peach iced tea - both delicious!!) without us saying anything. That's a mark of great service.  - the food came in a timely manner and before the food there was bread with an olive oil dip - we ordered the butter cake for dessert and toon it back to the hotel with us. Sooo yummy! It's worth trying it out with the whipped cream which Nikki out in a little container for us so that it wouldn't melt from the heat of the cake. The cake is slightly sweet but not overwhelming.  - there is no charge to make the crust whole wheat - there is no additional charge to have two different halves on the pizzas - the pricing is pretty reasonable. $40 for two drinks, a shared 6 slice pizza and a cake with ice cream The Not So Good: - The pizza was just ok. We had half spicy chicken chipotle and half sausage/pepperoni with whole wheat crust. There wasn't too much chicken and it was buried in the corn and pepper topping. The pizza came with a cilantro crema which was fantastic. The sausage/meatball half really lacked sausage. On one of the three slices there was only one measly meatball which was unfortunate because the toppings were very good. The crust was slightly burnt as well.  - On the menu there is an additional $2ish extra charge for ice cream. Nikki did not inquire as to whether we wanted it or not so we were a little surprised when we received the bill and it was there but since she was so nice we decided to just go with it.  - When we got back to the hotel with the dessert we noticed that they didn't provide us with spoons to eat it with which was surprising because Nikki knew we were staying in a hotel. Thankfully we had a package of plastic spoons from before so we were able to eat the butter cake.  Summary: We will definitely go back to the restaurant because of the uniqueness of the menu and our overall experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2?start=60

After waiting 15 min for his meal we enjoyed our salad and pizza which cost us 50 bucks. We would never make the decision to come back. We are just going to have the same meal with better quality somewhere else. And also for a more meaningful price.

This was the first and probably last time I'll ever come to this particular CPK. My boyfriend and I walked in on a Thursday night around 6:30 or 7pm. There was no hostess/host at the stand. After a little bit of time, the bartender (I think) came by to seat us. There was no apology for our wait and barely any greeting. We were seated and began to look at the menu. Our waitress took a long time to swing by to say hello or get our drinks. We were ready to order once she finally came by to get our drinks, but weren't even given the opportunity. Once again, no apology on our long wait to be acknowledged. She took our drink orders and basically ran off to fetch them instead of see if we had any questions on the menu or if we were ready to order. We ordered when she came back and the food was mediocre. We had very little sauce on our pizzas (a barbecue chicken pizza and Thai chicken pizza) and were told that we can't get extra sauce after the pizza has been made. The icing on the cake was when we were done with our meal, we wanted dessert. The waitress came back to ask if we wanted any dessert and when we said yes, I thought she went to get a menu for us but instead we were presented with a check. NO THANKS. I have never experienced such terrible service from a well-known restaurant, and bad food to top it off. I'm not sure if service is always that bad, or if it was just a classic case of ""they look like a super young couple and they won't tip well anyway so I'll barely take care of them"".

The managers are nice and care about their customers. The servers are efficient and professional.  The pizza is yummy and not very oily.  My favorite is the pear and Gorgonzola one.  It's very unique and the taste blends very nicely.  Sam loves their California Veggie.  I like the fact they have some healthy choices even though it's a chain restaurant.   Their chocolate soufflé, tiramisu, and butter cake are great choices for your sweet tooth cravings.   Go check this location out, it's good!

Dessert was wonderfull  If you are vegetarian or want to try something new you just try the buffalo cauliflower and the Mediterranean spring roll and you must must just try the pesto pasta.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2?start=20
Amy Jo A.,"Davie, FL",15,699,678,4.0,4/9/2015,"would love to rate five stars and would if it wasn't in this mall.  malls and I are just not feeling connected lately.  I think im not alone.  in any case, this is the closest location to me.  ordered takeout.  Hawaiian pizza and two thai chicken crunch salads.  guy at front gave us bread and pesto dipping sauce too.  everything really good. just pricey for takeout in my mind. décor clean and modern as this location is fairly new.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2?start=20
Jorge A.,"Hollywood, FL",2,22,11,5.0,5/28/2016,Great atmosphere and fast service. The pizza came out so amazing! I love the jamaican jerk pizza! Its so good! I cant wait to go back and try a new pizza again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2?start=20
Marita S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,11,,5.0,6/15/2017,"I got a catering order for 20 people today and it was great. The order was on time, well packed, and the portions were generous. Everything we needed was included. I would recommend using CPK if you need a delicious catered lunch. The staff was on point in getting every thing together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2?start=20
Veronica R.,"Hialeah, FL",4,9,12,5.0,11/18/2016,"This location was great. My husband and I stopped here for lunch after some shopping and we were attended to right away. The service was great I believe our servers name is Cindy. She gave us suggestions on what to eat and she made sure our cups were full. The food was great! I had the lunch special which was a soup and half sandwich, it was the perfect amount of food. Everything was great I recommend this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2?start=20
Mell R.,"Sunrise, FL",2,28,132,5.0,1/6/2013,"New to the Sawgrass Mills mall. California Pizza Kitchen is a great addition to the facility. Everyone loves pizza! The menu includes other items that I have not tried. The tiramisu is excellent. I have 2 kids and their kids menu is extremely affordable. Lots of choices. Free refills on all kids drinks, including chocolate milk and apple juice. The kids desserts are $1 and include a choice of a brownie or Sundae. Good service. Great food. Check them out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2?start=80
Lynette P.,"North Lauderdale, FL",11,12,13,4.0,1/22/2014,"I love the wild mushroom pizza, the pear something-something and redvelvet for dessert. If you like starters, the white corn guacamole is awesome. The mac and cheese we didnt like. If you like to keep on the healthy side, the whole wheat dough i great, and ask for pizzas that have many leafy greens on top.. All awesome!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2?start=80
Meli G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,5,1,5.0,2/28/2015,"The food is great! Their salmon was absolutely amazing it had a great taste and texture.

Big D.,"Coral Gables, FL",3,11,9,1.0,8/8/2014,"i was here last saturday august 2. place was pretty packed (tax free weekend) food is very good! service was excellent!  however, the hostess ignored me and my little kid and decided to entertain a party of 4 that got there after me. i was literally standing in front of the hostess stand outside waiting to be acknowledged but when the party of 4 got there i was skipped and the hostess decided to talk to them first. thankfully the party behind me had the courtesy to tell the hostess that i was there first. i understand if there were no tables ready for 2 guests but atleast acknowledge your guest as a courtesy and do not ignore them. i did not ask for the hostess name but she was a dark skinned lady with curly hair.  i am a regular at the coral gables location and they get extremely busy.  i feel that the hosting staff at that location has a more welcoming vibe.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2?start=80
Ruth M.,"Thornhill, Canada",14,15,101,4.0,12/30/2014,Service was a little slow but the restaurant was very busy. The thin crust pizzas were very good as were salads.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2?start=80
Luisa C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",828,237,467,2.0,3/26/2013,"Wow - this pizza was not good. Let me first talk about the positive things: - they do offer whole wheat/grain crust, which is a big plus; - they do have healthy menu options like split pea and quinoa on their menu; - their customer service was great, maybe even excessively nice; - their salted caramel pudding was good, but not the greatest. Negative:  - pizza toppings either too little or too much, with too many sauces - pizza just did not taste good. My fiance could not not finish his pizza and did not even want to box it. They provided us with free dessert, which was nice on their part.  We will not be coming back .  We were really hoping for a good pizza joint but I guess California Pizza Kitchen is not the one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2?start=80
Paul D.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,10,,1.0,7/20/2015,"Worst pizza I have ever been served.  A ""white"" pizza with so little cheese on it that most of it was just like a large, dry, crisp cracker.  I should have sent it back, but I was with coworkers, so I did not want to make a scene.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2?start=80
Mari S.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",10,73,170,4.0,7/13/2013,"Service is a little slow but if you love fresh, fire oven baked style pizza (with out the burned crust) then you will love the pizza here. Love their drinks (frozen mango lemonade and sangria), atmosphere and over all the food is good. I always skip the dessert here and that is why I rated it 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2?start=80
Liliana Z.,"Miami, FL",45,80,67,4.0,8/10/2014,"Friendly service and although is a chain, the food remains loyal to its roots from California where I used to eat at quite often while living there in the 90's. The chicken tequila fettucini remains as my all time favorite along with their legendary BBQ chicken pizza. The strawberry lime margarita (shaken) is amazing!!! I am not sure if they make it with fresh strawberries but it sure doesn't taste like syrup. Love CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2?start=80
Pammi K.,"Ashburn, VA",1,10,,4.0,7/19/2013,"I know, its a chain but we really enjoyed a wonderful lunch while visiting the area. First the bad ...  The service was rather slow.  We waited almost 25 mins for our food after we ordered. The server was new and she overcharged us and it took 3 tries to have the check corrected! Other than that there were no issues so moving on to the good part...  The kids picked pizza and pasta from kids menu which was standard but they liked it. We ordered the guacamole and chips as a starter and it was fresh and flavorful.  For our main entrees we got the roasted veggie salad and the roasted veggie pizza on whole grain crust.  Hubby and I shared the two items and they were both tasty.  I love it when restaurants don't skimp over ingredients in a salad.  You know, some places its 70% lettuce and only 30% main components. This one didn't, there was a good quantity of roasted veggies and avocado on the salad along with the lettuce.  It was tossed well in the dressing.  Just perfect.   The pizza was excellent and the best part is my kids asked to try a slice because it looked so appetizing.  And then they asked for seconds!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2?start=80
Salvatore D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",66,76,123,3.0,5/19/2014,"Not bad at all. I met up here with a couple of friends and their adorable baby yesterday. Although it was lunch time on a Sunday there was no wait (although it was pretty busy by the time we left).  The server was friendly and attentive, and made sure the kiddo had her food quickly (good call, server lady!) My buddy and I shared the Wild Mushroom Pizza with Truffle Oil and Chicken Club Sandwich. The pizza was really good and had a good ratio of cheese and toppings. The only thing that was odd was the fact they serve the truffle oil on the side... in a little dish. This made it a little awkward when trying to pour the oil evenly on the pizza, but I guess we were able to handle this daunting task :) Only gripe: I prefer my pizza to be crispy... the dough/pizza was cooked thoroughly, but a little more crispy would have been nice.  The club sandwich was tasty as well, but big chunks of lettuce made it a little messy (the lettuce kept falling out with every bite). Again, we managed. Overall... great service and tasty food. Would I go back? Probably not my first choice, but I wouldn't object :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2?start=80
A A.,"Raleigh, NC",1,70,33,2.0,7/8/2015,"We would've had a good time if they hadn't messed up twice. The server was great but the kitchen messed up our pizza and put BACON in it which is a serious problem because we don't eat pork for religious reasons. Once we told them, they took it back and the manager offered dessert but we were done. The other pizza we got was good (can't remember which one). They also made our virgin pina colada wayyyyy too sweet. It was like pure pineapple juice. Had to send that back too. Womp womp womp.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2?start=80
Jessica C.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",1,14,2,5.0,7/11/2013,I was really surprised and impressed! I had never eaten here before but I'm glad my friend insisted because it was great!

Carol S.,"Pompano Beach, FL",16,3,,2.0,8/13/2013,"Pizza was only Ok this time. But what I came here to 'complain' mainly was POOR service and hygiene! Went for late lunch on a monday, so was empty. Server was very slow. Didn't bring water refills and didn't come back to check on us, or to give the check. He was too busy talking to his co-workers. Servers look very inexperienced or lazy (?), bringing your HOT pizza without a glove, rubbing against his shirt... the other guy picking his nose... servers checking a girl out when she walks in because she has almost no clothes on... lol Maybe, only maybe I'll be back. I've had much better experiences at other locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2?start=80
