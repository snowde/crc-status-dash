Anj N.,"Tampa, FL",229,114,1095,4.0,1/3/2018,"Eating here was a last minute decision and we are glad we did. I haven't eaten at a CPK since college and funny enough I was worried that it wouldn't be as good as I remembered. I am glad that my memory was correct. We came a few days after Christmas and we were quickly seated. Our waiter, Conor was great! Very friendly and got our water and free bread quickly to us. We decided to get the buffalo cauliflower as our starter and we were very boring choice with our pizza and got the pepperoni, sausage and mushroom.  The buffalo cauliflower was great! We both enjoyed it and was glad we decided to get it.  The pizza was great! I wish we were adventurous with our pizza decision but we both are kinda picky eaters and instead of arguing, we went with the easiest pick.  I am excited to come back and a different pizza!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tampa
Christina G.,"Tampa, FL",1336,992,1507,4.0,11/27/2017,"Solid, unassuming food that appeals to almost everyone. (Review of lunch) There is definitely a cult following for CPK. My friend arranged a lunch with three of her other friends, who I had never met before, and their children (at our table of four adults we had two toddlers, a five-year-old, and a ten-year-old.) Upon sitting everyone whipped out their phones to open their CPK app. There's a rewards program. One of them explained to me that if you don't eat here that often you really don't need the app, but they eat there almost every week.  I've gleaned a couple reasons why people love CPK so much. 1. It has mid range pricing. You can spend $10 on lunch or upwards of $20 depending on what you order.  2. The food appeals to almost everyone. Since I'm eating healthy there were tons of salad options for me. The kids were able to grab pizza, pasta, and chicken nuggets. Another friend opted for a pizza and another went with salmon. Literally something for almost everyone.  3. It's clean, open, and inviting. The space is one giant dining room and the clientele are mostly moms with their kids or people looking like they are going to a fitness studio (a class above your standard gym). If CPK was a student at your high school, it would be the squeaky clean popular kid that doesn't offend anyone.  I got the California Field Salad, which I think is seasonal. It comes with strawberries, pistachios, and watermelon. The half size is more than enough. It was a solid salad (I mean, I'm at CPK, just from the description above would you expect anything else?) I think CPK knows its target audience well and caters to them. I like eating here and I would definitely do so in the future, especially if I'm with a big group or a picky eater.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tampa

The food is all great, I've never tried something here which  I disliked. Their cauliflower buffalo appetizer is my absolute favorite. I can eat it anytime!

Kristi S.,"Tampa, FL",52,139,1182,3.0,6/17/2017,"CPK is a chain, so I don't find it necessary to ever try it if you haven't. Their salads are pretty good (and huge). Their pizza is nothing to write home about either, especially not compared to a plethora of independent, local pizza restaurants you could support instead. I've been to this location a couple times, and service is a little slow, mostly the kitchen. My waiters have never been rude. Quite the opposite. But, to be fair to all restaurants, I judge them by how often my water glass is empty. And it's empty a lot here. That being said, I sat at the bar last time and enjoyed my experience. The bartender was friendly and didn't judge me when I told her I was just there to drink. I ordered the sangria flight, and it was decent. I wouldn't go back specifically for it, but it was a nice way to relax while I was waiting for a friend. Overall, I'd say you can skip experiencing CPK altogether, but this location is not terrible if you do decide to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tampa
Art C.,"Sarasota, FL",7,522,523,4.0,6/23/2017,"Pretty good pizza Of all the restaurants at the International Plaza, CPK is the one we tend to visit the most.  That isn't often, we seldom make it up this way, but we did again last night.  It was busy but there was no wait, and our service was spot on the entire visit.  I like the restaurant, I think they did a nice job for a place that is much narrower than square. For my dinner I had their Mushroom, Pepperoni and Sausage pizza, my wife a Bahn Mi Bowl.  We shared.  Her bowl was pretty cool, with the ingredients cut with a spiralizer into long sometimes very long pieces like spaghetti.  For my the pizza we asked for all the sausage on one side in case you noticed an imbalance in the photo.  Their pizza was flavorful.  I have had larger pizzas and/or a thicker amount of cheese and toppings for the price but for this visit, it was pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tampa

If you don't like spice, it wouldn't be the choice for you but I LOVE spice.  I gave them a 5 because of customer service. We had our 1 year old with us and they had no complaints about bring her a fresh avocado. They even cut it up and she thoroughly enjoyed it.  Along with our pizza we had spinach dip and drinks.

Ameesh P.,"Tampa, FL",295,594,270,4.0,4/17/2017,"I've always been a fan of CPK, but it always slips my mind when at the International Mall due to its out of the way location away from the rest of the restaurants at Bay Street.  I used to frequent CPK a lot more when I worked in the Westshore area so it was a nice reunion of sorts when I decided to dine here for dinner recently.  Our server was very attentive and offered great drink and pizza suggestions.   I ended up getting the Tostada pizza, which came on a thin crust and was topped with black beans, lettuce, tortilla strips and was served with a side of salsa.  I had chicken added to mine as well.  The pizza/portion was massive and easily lasted me 2 additional meals after what I ate in the restaurant that night.  A pretty good staple when you're looking for some sort of pizza in a sit down setting.  They also have other entrée options, but my go to here is always pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tampa

Nick C.,"Tampa, FL",10,124,50,5.0,7/27/2017,"One of the best places in the Tampa Bay Area to get perfectly inauthentic pizza, that is not trying to be authentic, hence the name California Pizza Kitchen. I started off with the white bean and corn guacamole and chips which was perfectly chunky and had an amazing variety of different flavor profiles. I then ordered the mushroom pizza with the white truffle oil and it was amazingly delicious. The mushroom pizza had the perfect amount of cheese on it, the perfect amount and variety of mushrooms on it, and the crust was seductively crispy. The white truffle oil tied the pizza together and brought out the flavors of the pizza. The service was great and relatively quick. Overall, the second best pizza in the Tampa Bay Area and the best pizza in Tampa's Westshore district.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tampa
Temenah C.,"Anaheim, CA",393,1040,3,5.0,12/28/2016,"Some people might think I'm crazy for giving CPK 5 stars, but, I mean, it's a known entity and it never disappoints. When I ate here I realized how long it's been since I've eaten at a CPK. I used to absolutely love it! First of all, I sat at the bar on a Thursday evening and it was pretty empty. The bartender was attentive and very helpful. She was also very friendly. I wish I knew her name so I could shout her out, but I'm terrible with names. I ordered a Bianco Flatbread and I loved it. Mainly because you can't go wrong with truffles on anything ever. Also, it was a legit flatbread in that it was crisp without tasting like a cracker. I also ordered the Caesar Salad with grilled chicken. It was good, but I wish I asked them to put the dressing on the side as there was a lot on it. Normally that's a good thing but I was trying to keep things tight and didn't want to derail off creamy salad dressing.  Now that I rekindled my love affair with CPK I'll definitely be at the ones near my house.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tampa
Mary J.,"Tampa, FL",223,347,720,4.0,12/4/2016,"Going anywhere near a shopping mall in December to dine on a Saturday night was not my first choice. But my dining companion is a fan of this place and I was ready to give it a try.  Fortunately heading there around 7 p.m. was a breeze with little in the way of traffic. Parking in the lot closest to this restaurant was plentiful so I was thinking, so far, so good. Then I saw the wait list. Now this is a fairly spacious restaurant and the turnover rate seemed to be moving folks in and out at a good clip. But seeing the names already listed gave me pause.  I added my name for what was estimated to be about a 10-minute wait and hoped for the best. By the time the second member of my part of two arrived, I was already seated. Off to a promising start. It was not long before a server swooped by and took drink orders. And almost as quickly he was back, first with bread and olive oil for dipping and then the drinks.  Our table for two was comfortably located alongside another dining duo on one side and a family of four on the other. But the sound level was pleasantly low enough to easily allow for conversation even though the place was packed. When the food arrived in a very timely manner (the kitchen is quick even when it is swamped), drinks were re-addressed by the server and the eating enjoyment began.  I had checked out the menu online before arriving and was impressed with the variety of dishes offered here. There are certainly pizzas but so much more and everything sounded appealing. Oddly there were no prices posted on the online menu or the menu on display at the entrance to the restaurant but, fortunately, food here is reasonably priced. There seemed to be a point person circulating the floor throughout the evening monitoring and checking in with guests. Probably a big part of the reason things seemed to move so smoothly. I had to pass on dessert even though my friend, who knows firsthand, really recommended the Butter Cake. Fortunately this seems to be the sort of in-demand restaurant that will remain here for a while. And that means more opportunities to go back and enjoy its quality service, tasty food and tempting Butter Cake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tampa

Diana A.,"Tampa, FL",319,175,112,5.0,1/9/2017,Displease has always been one of my favorites. The service has never failed me let alone their pizza. The best part of this place has to be the pizza obviously. They have many choices for the pizza. My favorite choice is to do half-and-half that way you can try little bit of everything. The barbecue has to be the most delicious pizza I have ever had. The only thing that would make this place even better is if they had calzones.

Bridgette S.,"Tampa, FL",390,95,105,3.0,7/28/2016,"A quick evening catch up with a friend of mine after a long and busy day.  This location is conveniently located in the International Plaza Mall just outside of Nordstom.  I was seated quickly and then my server completely ignored me for about 10 minutes. I needed to order a drink and was slightly annoyed that I had to flag her down. Once I did so, she was sweet as pie. And then once I got my drink, I was fine :-)  My friend and I split the guac appetizer which was small, but mighty and so tasty! The avocado was so fresh and came in huge chunks mixed with corn and other yummy goodness served with tortilla chips.  Next came the quinoa and arugula salad which had tons of my favorite sun-dried tomatoes in it tossed in a champagne vinaigrette with cheese and onions. It was SO good!! We did get pizza (duh! Who goes to the pizza kitchen and leaves without a slice - or 3?!) We got the 3 cheese and tomato and added pepperoni. It was SO delicious!!! Fresh outta the oven and just tasty! We were stuffed and satisfied by the time we left.  If the service was just a little more on point and I was acknowledged when seated, I would have given it 4 or mor stars.

Yanna S.,"Norwalk, CT",132,49,39,3.0,3/19/2016,It's a pretty cool restaurant located in the mall. Fairly large with plenty of seating so you don't feel crammed in.  The waitress we had was friendly  and very accommodating- the food was pretty good too- the most memorable thing I had was the pea/ barley soup.  Now as far as drinks go it went downhill from there. I ordered a margarita which was served in a Tiny glass (probably meant for water) and it was ALL ice! 2 sips and it was gone- brought it to the waitresses attention so I ordered another one and asked to go light on the ice! It was still served in the same tiny glass. But at least I got the first drink taken off the bill. For 8$ you at least expect to get more then 4oz of mostly ice!!  If you're going to go just stick to food - don't go for drinks - complete rip off - they need to get appropriate size drinking glasses- especially for the amount their charging!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tampa?start=40

There was a wait for a table so we decided to sit at the bar and just walked right in! We are happy we did. It was great watching the kitchen. They made our pizzas right in front of us.  I just had pepperoni because I was skeptical. Like I said I hadn't been to a CPK in years because my last experience wasn't a good one. (maybe that's because it was at LAX) but it was enough for me not to go back for 10+ years.  My boyfriend got the BBQ pizza.

Philly R.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,13,11,2.0,1/22/2016,"International Plaza was quite packed for a Friday pm. It seemed most people were dining across the mall at the other end but I was looking for something a little low key. Ventured the other way and found California Pizza Kitchen and the bar was wide open.  The minute I sat down the bartender cleaned around my area, but not my area so I had to ask him to clean the area I sat in. Then I asked if he had recommendation for a local beer, but he didn't. I ended up ordering a brew I had never tried. I could feel my experience already starting to go downhill. Next it was time to place my order. I decided on a wedge salad and Bianco flatbread suggested by bartender. Definitely recommend the flatbread. It was thin crust with just the right amount of cheese, sage and truffle. I also ordered a wedge salad, it was TERRIBLE! Drenched in blue cheese dressing and had no flavor. Disappointed that my salad and flatbread came out at the same time. I would have preferred to try to enjoy my over dresses salad first and then try to eat my flatbread.  CPK is a chain and I have had good experiences at many of them. You look for consistency in chain restaurants. Tonight was mediocre. They haven't lost my business but this location doesn't have the attention to detail that is expected when you go out on a Friday night for dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tampa?start=40

Steve E.,"Tampa, FL",201,1582,5020,4.0,10/9/2013,"California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) was founded in Beverly Hills, CA in the mid 1980's to provide a casual-dining restaurant with a healthy California twist on hearth-baked pizzas, salads, pastas, entrees, soups, and salads. This CPK can be found inside International Plaza on the lower level near Nordstrom, just at the bottom of the escalators to the second floor, and it's the perfect place to stop if you're looking for a quick meal while still enjoying the air conditioning in the mall. We stopped in for dinner after a productive day of shopping, and started by sharing one of their new shaved mushroom and spinach flatbreads which was shavings of Cremini mushrooms, chopped sautéed spinach, and California olive oil sprinkled with Romano and Parmesan cheeses and served on toasted flatbread. With that I ordered a cup of the Sedona Tortilla soup which was vine-ripened tomatoes, tomatillos and corn with mild green chilies and Southwestern spices. Garnished with tortilla strips. Nice, and plenty spicy! I also had the Thai Crunch salad which had crisp veggies and cilantro with grilled and cubed chicken, avocado, and the crunch of peanuts, wontons and rice sticks. That was served with their Thai peanut dressing. I've had several of their different pizzas, pastas and sandwiches over the years, but seem to be drawn to the unique flavors of their many different dinner-sized salads. Many are geared for vegetarians, but you can add chicken, shrimp or salmon to your liking.

We ordered the veggie spring rolls as an appetizer which was in lieu of the buffalo cauliflower as it wasn't available initially. Would recommend these. We then shared a mushroom pizza. The pizzas are a good size for 2 people to share as long as you're not overly hungry. Server then later told us that buffalo cauliflower was now available. Since my boyfriend and I are vegetarians and have loved buffalo cauliflower at other places, we were excited to try theirs which is made with a sriracha sauce.

Travis H.,"Sarasota, FL",50,114,355,4.0,2/14/2016,"Having lived in Hawaii for 7 years or so, I ate at the 3 different CPK's on Oahu more times than I care to admit. My wife and I were ecstatic to find one here, and immediately decided on celebrating Valentine's Day here.  We lucked into a Valentine's special which was 2 for $32. We got an appetizer (spinach artichoke dip), two pizzas which I snapped pictures of (halfway through eating them, sorry), and a dessert of our choice. We chose the butter cake which was fantastic. The food was as good as I could've asked it to be. CPK at its best. Our waiter Michael was awesome! Cheery, attentive, and understanding.  The only reason I can't give this a 5 star review is due to the hostess. She asked us if we wanted a table or a booth, and added that the booth was in the back. We didn't oppose and chose the booth. What she failed to mention was that the booth was literally right next to the bathroom door. It smelled terrible as people opened and closed the bathroom doors repeatedly so we asked to move to an outside table. Once we sat down outside I quickly began to smell trash. Low and behold, the outside seating is relatively close to the dumpster. We just accepted it at that point and enjoyed our time.  I know there isn't much they can do about the seating arrangement, but this was a bit ridiculous to seat customers in front of the bathroom and then by a dumpster (with a small white wall roughly 5ft high being the only thing between the table and trash).  Great food paired with great service from Michael means we will certainly be back. We'll just make sure to sit in the front of the restaurant next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tampa?start=20
Sieraaj A.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",17,35,190,3.0,9/8/2016,"(17 Jul 2016) We went to CPK for a late lunch, it wasn't spectacular but it wasn't bad, just above mediocre I'd say.  We ordered the mac and cheese, surprisingly to us it came in balls, I've never seen this before however, it tasted like 'yes, more please!'. We also got the california pizza, I have to be honest, I stopped reading the description after 'bacon', that's all I wanted. They additional toppings were chicken, arugula, fresh tomato, avo and lettuce. I could've done without the lettuce, it's a weird ingredient to have on a pizza and made it feel quite heavy. I do understand that they were going for a salad/pizza vibe but it just didn't cut it for me. The pizzas were also quite small compared to other pizza restaurants vs price. They offer a whole grain base option and thin crust pizza's which I've noticed is very rare in the US.  The restaurant was busy and the service was great! I would like to go again to try out a few other pizzas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tampa?start=20

Pranam P.,"Tampa, FL",239,106,74,4.0,5/9/2015,"Oh CPK, you never cease to make me and my tummy happy (we are two different people).  I have personally been to this location a couple times and have pretty much found out what is pretty good, and also what's not so hot. If you are worried about how busy it is, it's in a very busy mall with some hungry people...so expect to wait a little bit. They have a bar now, so that should keep you company until you get a seat! When you get your table, to start off you would probably want to order pizza since it is California PIZZA kitchen, I mean no spoilers here. They have options for EVERYONE (food allergies, veggie heads, carnivores, etc)! I have personally tried 4 of the original hand-tossed pizzas which include the five cheese + fresh tomato, mushroom pepperoni sausage, the original bbq chicken, and the works. They are fantastic! The only thing I would complain about are the prices for the portion size, but you really are just paying for the taste. Each of these pies has a unique seasoning blend that encompasses the sauce, crust, and ingredients, so you really do get immersed in the pizza. I take my pizza very seriously. After you get pizza, you should try the chicken tequila fettuccine! ITS THE BEST PASTA DISH I'VE EVER HAD! I swear by the pasta gods, that this is incredible. You get a big portion size, so you will be happy now, going home, and when you get home because you will be snacking all night long.  So I've named all of the good things, let's start with the not so good things. Didn't really enjoy the spicy chicken tinga quesadilla, they were tasty, but very dry so you had to drown it in the ranchito sauce... however, the ranchito sauce was a bit rancido tasting if you catch my drift. I have also tried 2 of the crispy thin crust options which were tasty on the top, but was pretty much burnt all the way through and was rock hard. I would say give it a go because I had both of them on the same day. Also some of the staff members are not very nice. One of the waiters's names is Marec? Marek? I am not sure how to spell it, but he is wonderful, so I would suggest asking if he is there! Overall, lots to try!

The menu now includes halibut. Don't expect a sophisticated and perfectly-executed dish like the cedar plank salmon. The halibut sits on a bed of farro soaked in salty, fatty goo. It's a large portion of unremarkable food that gets less appetizing the more you slog through it.

Paul V.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",11,33,,3.0,8/17/2013,"California Pizza Kitchen is one of those restaurants that I don't really eat at unless there's some sort of work lunch going on there. In this case, it was a co-worker's birthday. We visited on a Friday afternoon, and the place was packed. As a result our server was on the brusque side: he had a tendency to kind of plop multiple orders on the table and let us figure out where they went. He did get us in and out of the restaurant on time, though. I ordered their ""classic"" garlic chicken pizza, which is apparently a signature item of theirs. The crust was nice, but a little underdone, topped with cheese, grilled chicken, grated scallions, and a generous amount of roasted garlic. No sauce, which struck me as a little strange, but I enjoyed it anyway. My server suggested that the pizza was intended for one person, but I don't recommend eating an entire one by yourself. Split it if possible. My co-workers ordered various salads, and everybody seemed pretty happy with what they got. They've got one of the fancy Coca-Cola machines with all of the various syrups and flavorings, which is nice if you're like me and you miss Coke with Lime. Somebody else compared California Pizza Kitchen to the Cheesecake Factory, and I think that's an apt comparison.

In that time, I've tried almost every pizza they have and most of their pastas...and there all really good. My two favorite items are their white pizza and their macaroni and cheese. While CPK might not be a place that is super adventurous, what they do they do well and their pizzas are unique and delicious. The service is what took them from three to four stars. I can't speak for any location other than this one at International Plaza, but they are all GREAT! They get to know you, joke with you, and are super friendly. Within the last couple of months they started their small plate items...YUM! Crispy Mac-n-Cheese and the focaccia sticks are heaven.

Coty S.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",1903,1448,3684,2.0,9/2/2009,"I came to this location not expecting much.  Everything is overpriced except the pizza and the pasta.  The wait staff here is very honest, and will tell you straight up if they think that they are not going to like an item or to recommend entrees to you based on your tastes.  Our waitress also stressed the point that if you do not like something that they will bring you another entrée with no questions asked and with no hesitation.  And, we did not even provoke such a statement, but it is nice to know. The Cherry Limeade ($2.99, no refill) is badass!  The best I have ever had.  I attempted to avoid all of the cheese covered items, so I ordered the Lettuce Wraps (about $10.00) which were surprisingly good.  It would have been better with a better lettuce, instead of cheap snappy iceberg, and if it was $4.00 cheaper.  But, live and learn.  I also ordered a half salad of the Miso Salad ($11.49 half), which is a glorified coleslaw with 3 diced shrimp and some crab meat on top.  The dressing was even sweet like cole slaw and I did not taste any miso at all.  I would have been so pissed if this was the only thing that I ordered and actually ordered a full size for $15.00.  What a rip-off.  My check for just me was $28.00 w/ tip.  This experience is very much like eating at Cheesecake Factory, same prices and quality but without the four hour wait. My co-workers ordered a White Pizza and a Mushroom Pizza.  Both were exceptional and around $12.00 for a 10 inch.  I don't think that I will ever be coming back here, because I do not drive all the way to Tampa to eat pizza.  If you do happen to eat here,  just order the damn pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tampa?start=80

Despite this, the tacos are actually pretty good, and the salsa is a little spicy. What can I say, it's hard to be really tough on a decent chain restaurant which provides standardized food nationwide. The strong point here is the wait staff.

However, this might be attributed to the fact that I was sharing with my son so we were only limited to the pepperoni and cheese pizza. Probably the only difference between this pizza and those I've had in the past was that CPK's pizza had a slightly sweeter pizza sauce. For appetizer, however, I ordered Avocado Club Egg Rolls. The ingredients blended well, but it had a lot of grease dripping off of it. Not very healthy for self-proclaimed ""Californian food.""

Mimi B.,"Reston, VA",0,38,,2.0,1/27/2016,"I ordered the 1/2 grilled veggie ciabatta and salad combo for lunch for a total $9.95 plus tax. I ordered the sesame ciabatta instead of the parmesan bread.  The sandwich included a huge piece of white bread in the form of a crusty dinner roll, not so much the traditional ciabatta. Inside was a sliver of grilled green pepper and mushrooms, but mainly lettuce with a tiny slice of tomato and a piece of sun-dried tomato. Comparing it to other grilled veggie sandwiches which I've ordered at other restaurants, it was skimpy and more like a salad sandwich than grilled veggies, but mainly white bread. If you like to eat a lot of starch and simple carbohydrate for lunch, then it would be great pick.  I ordered the companion Mediterranean salad without the feta cheese. For the price of the lunch, although the salad was fresh and delicious, it was very small, and in my opinion the meal was not worth the price. My lunch guests were of the same opinion that the meal was skimpy and left one wanting more. They both ordered the soup and salad combo. The soups were delicious, but the salad was tiny. We all went away feeling like we needed something more substantial for lunch. Had we filled up on the refined,white (Italian) bread full of carbohydrates that was served before our meal, then we would have gone away full and fatter. Also if you are looking for food that is dairy free, egg free, meat-poultry-fish free, you won't find it on their menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tampa?start=80
Jim B.,"Tampa, FL",59,599,138,3.0,6/4/2011,"So... been quite a while since I did CPK. Not much has changed, except the pricing, which has increased. I'd probably eat here more often, but, yeah... you can easily pop 20 bucks a person here for lunch. They have 3 pizzas I love: Thai Chicken (which is now easy to get in a lot of places), their BLT (which is a sublime textural mix of hot and cold) and the Pear Gorgonzola - which is simply sinful and divine. They also have this 'try something new' dealio to encourage you to break out and taste other menu items, and will replace the meal if for any reason you are not happy with what you order.  Good promotion I think - although I doubt many people take them up on it. Our waiter was personable, if not all that bright (according to my dining companion, he was dim but pretty - heh). He was generally efficient and generally our meal was fine. I gotta say though, the joint is overtly noisy, the wait times are offputting, and the prices have gotten to a point that I'm less of a fan than I used to be. I will come back, because the pear gorgonzola and BLT are unique to this venue, but my overall enthusiasm has cooled from where it was in the past.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tampa?start=80

Tonight, my wife had the lettuce wraps and they were great. The shrimp had a teriyaki flavoring, but matched with the lettuce, it was something great and out of the ordinary. I had a Mushroom, Pepperoni,and Italian Sausage Pizza and that was good. What makes CPK stand out is their dough. It has a hint of sweetness that goes just right with the flavors. I recommend the Mushroom, Pepperoni, Sausage Pizza and also the Wild Mushroom. Both are great.

We sat in a booth near the back and it wasn't that loud, it was just coming from large parties. It was cool walking past the front where you can see the chefs working on the pizzas and the have a glimpse at the brick ovens.  The menu looked extensive and there was so many pizzas to choose from and the pictures make them look so good! I usually go for anything spicy so I ordered the Buffalo Chicken pizza (also had corn, black beans, green wasabi, red chili, and onions) and my friend ordered the Barbeque Chicken pizza. Because the individual pizzas seemed pretty big for us, we decided to combine it half and half. The server was kind enough to mention that they charge extra ($2) for that, but I was really hungry and weighed the options and quickly said sure. I figured I'd rather pay $13 for this pie than $24 for 2 separate ones if we were going to try it anyway. I have to say when it arrived it looked really delicious and colorful. I loved my savory Buffalo Chicken pizza because it had the perfect amount of kick to it. The BBQ Chicken was sweet and pretty good too. Overall, I really liked this place.

I prefer my thin crust pizza to be more on the crispy side; this one was more soggy/chewy, what I normally associate with anything but thin crust. The sauce was fairly bland and could have used more (nay, some? any?) garlic. Even the basil had a weak flavor to it. Was it so bad that I'll never go back? No. I'll probably give them another go on the suspicion that I just caught them on a bad day. Granted, it was lunchtime, but calling it a lunch ""rush"" when I was there would be generous.

Personal preference, I suppose; other than that it was creamy deliciousness with just the right balance of sun-dried tomatoes. My coworker had the Hawaiian pizza. He liked it; I really kind of hate pineapple on pizza, so I picked it off & enjoyed what I did eat.
