Christine A.,"Beaumont, CA",25,32,,2.0,8/4/2017,So disappointed! The California Salad was terrible... Not fresh as advertised. The strawberries were mushy and sour. The watermelon was tasteless. The seasonings they use overwhelmed the dressing .. Ugh!!!! The pepperoni and cheese pizza tasted like s frozen pizza.  The server and manager were great but the food has gone downhill at CPK,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-temecula
Matthew S.,"Temecula, CA",0,50,1,5.0,12/27/2017,"I like their spin on pizza. The sauce isn't bland, tastes fresh, and the crust is nicely cooked. I recommend the carne asada pizza, one of my favorites.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-temecula
Mrs C.,"Murrieta, CA",0,153,28,4.0,1/4/2018,"Although I have been coming to CPK for close to 20 years, I have only been to the Temecula location a handful of times, and it had been nearly 5 years since my last visit. I was sadly disappointed to learn that they had done away with the Chinese Chicken Salad, since this was one of my favorite items on the menu! Boo! Anyway, ordered the Chicken Tequila Lime Fettucine...it was very good. Everyone else in my party had different pizzas and they were all satisfied with their meal. We also ordered dessert, butter cake, delicious, but very sweet, and the chocolate soufflé, just delicious. All in all, our meal was very good. Our server, Natalia, was excellent...friendly, helpful, attentive, and efficient. Great job! We'll be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-temecula

Joy K.,"Temecula, CA",222,180,2112,4.0,7/8/2016,"We were hungry and wanted a quick bite to eat before our movie. California Pizza Kitchen is conveniently located across from Regal Edwards Theaters in the Promenade Mall. We were seated immediately and  approached by our server, Danielle. We promptly received our drinks, crusty bread and seasoned olive oil for dipping. Within minutes (8 minutes is what is promised) we received our margherita pizza. I was very happy with the food and service.  We were finished eating and ready to go to our show within 30 minutes in plenty of time to make our movie!!! I have found the food and service from California Pizza Kitchens to be consistently good. This location is especially nice.   This is a chain restaurant and so there is no comparison to be made with our local speciality restaurants like Goat and Vine (G&V pizzas are out of this world delicious).  Bottom line for this review: convenient for a quick bite before a movie, good service, I recommend it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-temecula
Josh D.,"San Bernardino, CA",96,130,231,2.0,7/11/2016,Eh.  Haven't been to one of these in forever. Walking the Temecula promenade and wifey wanted to stop in here.  Staff was friendly. Server was a bit off.  Ordered 3 pizzas and some pasta.  Nothing special. Honestly you can find these pizzas in the frozen section at your local market for half the price and flavor almost the same lol.  Refills were slow.  $60 bill was too expensive for this type of food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-temecula
O.R. K.,"Fallbrook, CA",1,59,173,3.0,2/5/2017,"Dinner yesterday. Great Mojitos.  Regular and mango. My wife enjoyed both. Too sweet for me. Chicken Milanese was crispy/moist and the flavor is outstanding. Arugala salad was the perfect match for the panko crusted chicken. Very much recommended. I had the Halibut last time which I raved about. Chose Salmon roasted on a plank. I really was looking fwd to this dish. Salmon was not dry at all. It was roasted to my liking. No flavor, no buttery richness.  Hmmm, perhaps farm raised??? I poured the herb infused olive oil from our bread to add something to this dish. My recommendation would be to order the Halibut. Also, if you like red velvet cake, order it with vanilla ice cream. Definitely one of my favorite chain restaurants. Also, don't forget to show your club card to receive pts.

Marisa H.,"Murrieta, CA",19,152,27,3.0,9/10/2017,"Pizza has become literally cracker thin, it's really disappointing. I understand this helps them make more money but we really wish they wouldn't get so cheap. The salads are still good. I think maybe they should have crust choices for people who prefer a more normal crust. Everyone's pizzas we saw all looked ridiculously thin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-temecula
Harry J.,"San Jacinto, CA",8,3,,3.0,6/20/2017,"We stoped by CPK last night at nine P.M, after being seated our server stoped by and asked if we would like to order any drinks?  So we asked for 2 cups of coffee, she left and came back shortly and informed us that she can only  offer us one cup. I asked why and her reply was that there is only one cup left, now I am thinking that one cup must be very old. I asked her how long before brewing a new pot? She answered that she was not going to make another pot because the coffee was going to be wasted, If a package of coffee cost $1.80 and CPK would charging $6.00 for 2 cups of coffee they would make a buck or two on that , I know pricing since I am in the food business, we did not order anything to drink only ordered one pizza and left CPK for good.

Mark D.,"Temecula, CA",764,456,2350,5.0,7/8/2016,"California Pizza Kitchen  is a chain and you can find them in or near most malls. They are always clean and well lighted. We were going to a movie and we were forty-five minutes early. So we thought quick food? CPK was right across the street. The restaurant was doing a very robust business at 1.20 pm in the afternoon. There were but two or three booths that weren't being used. We got seated quickly and the waitress was there just as fast...great so far. Asked if they had any pizza slices already made, she says oh no we make each one fresh. Ok how long will it take.. 8 minutes. Sounds perfect. So we ordered a thin crust Margherita. While we waited we were treated to hot bread and seasoned olive oil. The pizza came in under 8 minutes and was quite delicious.  The waitress was good enough to have our ticket ready so we could settle up quickly. Great experience and certainly met my expectations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-temecula
Matt V.,"Temecula, CA",21,503,32,5.0,8/1/2016,"My wife is nuts for the Thai Spring Rolls with the peanut dipping sauce. Last weekend she ordered them and I had the full size Calif. Cobb salad. Scrumptious! Lots of chicken, lettuce, ranch dressing and a nice compliment of diced tomatoes, chopped boiled egg, bleu cheese and the best part, applewood bacon!! I also had a cup of the baked potato soup and it was good, you could taste the cheese and it was garnished nice with some sliced scallion and crumbled bacon. My salad was so big I had to take some home. My only complaint was there were some bratty kid next to us and the parents did nothing to stop him from annoying people at several tables, but the food and service were real good. Plus, I always like it when a restaurant manager is working the dining room, checking on your meal, taking care of the check, etc. The place was busy, yet everything seemed to run smoothly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-temecula
Leah S.,"Temecula, CA",4,51,5,5.0,6/30/2017,"Came in for dinner the other night and we sat down while my husband was buying movie tickets. Our waitress, Brooke, was fantastic. Got us drinks and him water, and when he came back she was right there to get him what he wanted to drink. She also mentioned that she knew we were trying to catch a movie so she would do her best to be prompt and she certainly was! Her recommendation of the cauliflower dish was excellent and she was attentive but not overly so..its not often that I leave so impressed with service but we both mentioned the excellent service Brooke provided so I felt compelled to pass it on. Our drinks were filled, she brought my daughter extra napkins and really is someone who is great at what she does. Thanks for the wonderful dinner Brooke!

Morgan G.,"Winchester, CA",27,175,23,4.0,12/20/2016,"CPK has recently become a staple for my wife and one of her girlfriends after then weekly stroll through the Promenade. Last week I was invited to tag along to run the errands, and as a result found myself at CPK for a quick lunch. After a morning of running errands and shopping at the mall, we had TONS of stuff in tow and required a larger booth to accommodate all of our belongings. The hostess didn't have any problem at all seating us in a booth twice the necessary size for the amount of people we had, and we were approaching the lunch rush. Our order was taken quickly, and the food came out even faster.  I had the Sam Adams winter lager with the chipotle chicken pizza, while my wife and her friend both enjoyed the soup/sandwich option. We were in and out quickly, and all very pleased with the service.

I had a salad, huge and filling, far from healthy, but the best thing we ordered that night. The pizza was pretty small and pricey, no great flavors going on, very lackluster, you can get better for much cheaper pretty much anywhere else. The noodle dishes even less inspiring, overcooked, lukewarm and the sauce watery, not worth the money. Clean location and the food came out quickly, just did not love the quality, it all seemed very generic.

The salad looked and tasted like it was made yesterday, The pizza looked dull and like it had been sitting out for awhile and didn't even taste good. It was barely warm when we got it. The pizzas you buy frozen taste better! The portions have gotten smaller over the years too, and the prices have gone up. Way too expensive for what you get. It's not even good anymore. They've really gone down hill. We won't be eating here again. Too many other good places with better food and less expensive. Update: we were both sick all night with stomach aches and other intestinal issues. Today, still feeling stomach aches. I will be attempting to contact CPK headquarters to report this.

Studlee L.,"Honolulu, HI",28,34,61,1.0,5/7/2017,Haven't been to California Pizza Kitchen in a while.  I ordered a pepperoni and sausage pizza.  The pizza came out after a long wait.  The food was luke warm and the pizza tasted marginal at best.  The service was slow and what really surprised me was when the pizza was put on our table the server did not offer us freshly grated parmesan cheese.  The service was slow and overall I would not go back to this place again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-temecula
Jasmine C.,"Menifee, CA",312,52,99,2.0,1/21/2016,"This review is only based on the Shrimp Scampi.  I first expected the portion to be a reasonable size for something that was worth about $15. But when I was served, it's was extremely small and disappointing. Not only was the portion very little, the taste was not even great AT ALL. No flavors whatsoever. I just kept eating the bread to trick myself into thinking I got full from it.  I kept thinking how sad that I wasted $15 on a tasteless meal. But besides the Shrimp Scampi, staff was excellent and served us on time. I had no problem with waiting and they were always nice to bring us bread. Despite my poor choice on the menu, I tipped generously because I was served nicely.  Before I return to this place, I'll make sure to check back on Yelp and see what looks appetizing first.

Erin E.,"Murrieta, CA",0,19,2,3.0,4/9/2017,"We went for a treat as we had $75 in gift cards. Thinking it would be sufficient for our family of 5, we enjoyed an evening out. First off, service was fantastic. The manager greeted us as it was our first visit and brought us an appetizer of roasted peppers to try. My hubby was the only one who likes peppers but he enjoyed them. Our server was very attentive and kept our drinks full and made sure we had everything we needed.  The disappointment came with our food. Bland bland bland. Pepperoni pizza was oddly sweet, my garlic chicken had little flavor, and the expensive carne asada with avocado had no flavor or balance at all. We sprinkled salt in everything and still it just felt like there was something missing from everything. The only thing we enjoyed was the avocado egg rolls. A disappointing meal, totaled $102! 4 personal pizzas, 1 appetizer, 1 cup of soup and 5 soft drinks. Wow. Service was the only thing that gave our visit as many stars or it would've been 2 based on food alone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-temecula?start=20

Once we finally ordered we had to wait forever about another 50 mins to get our food, and people who were seated 20 mins after us were getting there food way before us.  Also the quality in food and drink has gone down and the price up over the years. Our food sucked!! My sisters got a pepperoni pizza and it was cold and hard like it had been cooked a while ago and had just been left sitting there.  While the rest of us who got BBQ chicken pizza (their specialty) ate the most bland pizza of our lives.

Kristine T.,"Temecula, CA",37,5,,1.0,1/5/2017,"Okay...I consider myself pretty much an expert when it comes to good pizza considering I come from the Pizza Capitol of the world NJ/NY area...I have seen 4 and five star reviews and wonder if ANY of these people even KNOW what a good pizza is. I ordered this via food delivery and granted, I will admit that I didn't expect my pizza to be piping hot...but, not even WARM?!?!? It was COLD. Just plain COLD. Pizza crust, especially super thin pizza crust is good when it has a cracker crunch. This was so chewy, my jaw hurts from trying to chew it. I swear both pizzas looked as though they were cooked, refrigerated and then cooked again.  I got the ""wild"" mushroom (false advertising much?) and there was NOTHING wild about the mushrooms on this pizza. When I think of wild mushrooms I think of boletes, Chanterelles, or matsutaki. I admit that I knew what kind of mushrooms they were before I ordered but you cannot call it a ""wild"" mushroom pizza when the mushrooms come from the nearest grocery store. But I love mushrooms so I gave the name 'wild"" a free pass.  I bought a pepperoni pizza, the mushroom and a sandwich for my daughter and the bill came to 65.00!!!!!!!!!!! For flavor, I had to add some poi ploy chili sauce and cilantro to my ""wild"" mushroom pizza. The pepperoni pizza was pitiful as well. Just plain pitiful. I don't think there was even 13.00 worth of anything having to do with this pizza. I am rarely if ever displeased with the quality of a meal at any restaurant, but these pizzas were so below par I am shocked that ANYONE would give this chain 2 stars...much less a 4 or 5 star. I have been wanting to try this place for three years now and I couldn't be more disappointed. I am thoroughly disgusted at the 65.00 I paid for the convenience of delivery. NEVER AGAIN.

They packed all the utensils for serving and eating, and were super generous with the sauces.  Cons:  -$2 for a canned soda? I'm calling BS -They took forever to pack up my food.

Now, while Mychal was a good server, SOMETHING has changed, various employees, playing on the floor, using their cell phones, texting, I assume, yawning and basically not paying attention to the high standards of CPK or at least the way it use to be. In addition, my wife Chicken  Tequilla Fettuccine at a whopping $14.99 to have it served MINUS the chicken. Huh? How can that be? Wonder if  she hadn't noticed? Why didn't the chef pay attention as well as the server? Will we return? Not likely. BTW, the restaurant was dusty on the large window sills as well as the windows dirty. Don't get me wrong, Mychal was a good server, just stretched THIN between to many tables to pay attention to all of his customer.

And they serve bread with Olive oil too which is always a plus for me. Our server was friendly and prompt with drinks and our food. This restaurant is in a great location right across from the movie theater and the outdoor mall part. I don't come here very often because it is a little pricey but the food is always tasty.

When the food came out he places the food in front of me and says o yea they couldn't do the substitution. Ok. It took him an additional 10-15 minute to bring out additional sauce. Still no bread. Had to ask for refills. When it came to finalizing the bill, instead of splitting the bill since there were three of us, it came as one large bill. We go often and usually they offer to go drinks boxes etc. nothing. So we had to ask for boxes. Just all together a disappointing experience. He def seemed like he hated his job or maybe just us.

The hostess said of course we could sit outside, but we needed to wait until they could find a waitress to take us, since there wasn't a waitress out on the patio for service. We were then seated and nicely greeted by our server. Order taken/ food brought out and eaten. Then as we were eating we ordered items Togo. As it got really chilly out, as we waited!! We asked for the outside heaters to be turned on, after 15 mins! I went in to look for the manager to see where the problem was with that being made possible, I then was told to someone is on their way to fix it. As gracious as the busser was, after trying 4 heating lamps he said sorry,  I'm not able to light it.

I am not so sure its worth the $1.50, it wasn't very good in my opinion. For drinks we had the sangria and the long island iced tea.

The server waited upon another table that  was seated after myself, my drink was never refilled, I did not get my bread until I asked, and that was after trying to get my servers or anybody's else attention.  Remember, it was  NOT busy.  Any customer or staff that looked around the room would clearly see that I was trying to get the attention of a staff member, any staff member, the busboy would due! I felt invisible, unimportant as a customer, and I would have walked out if it were not for the fact that I was hungry  and the food is so good.

Nadia Fern C.,"Dallas, TX",2365,268,130,4.0,1/23/2009,"So yesterday I had ish to do in Temecula and figured I would try to swindle the bfs brother into a lunch date. Success. We met at CPK at ten after eleven. As I am sipping my water and he is enjoying his mango tea, we decided on half a chicken caesar for me and half a plain caesar for him. Around twenty minutes later our lovely waitress comes by to inform us our salads would be out in a few as my chicken was not quite done. Being quite the 'cooker' I am aware that breasts of chicken do not take anywhere near twentyfive minutes to cook so I audibly wonder why the eff it takes so long for chicken here. At any rate, our salads come out shortly and we dive in. We finish our lunch and the waitress clears the table and asks if we would like more drinks, yes please. We end up sitting here through the end of her shift, and through the end of someone elses. A random woman walked by once and asked to get us something which we happily obliged to. At one point following this, we were being completely ignored and I had to gently flag someone to bring us more beverages. Apparently we were the thirstiest people in the world! Five and a half hours, five bathroom trips, six waters for me and ten teas for the brothers bf LATER...we finally leave. Wow...I believe we set a world record. Thanks CPK Temecula for being so patient...despite the fact your restaurant was mostly empty majority of the time we were there, I appreciate you not heckling our gossip session.

For dinner, I ate half a field green salad with gorgonzola cheese. I'm a creature of habit, and this is my usual at CPK. I always order the half a salad, because the normal portion is huge, what  you would feed a family of four at home! While enjoying my meal, watching the hustle and bustle of the restaurant, this couple sat down next to me and ordered a slice of red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting. Apparently this stuff is amazing!  Other favorites at CPK are the BBQ pizza and the five cheese & tomato pizza both on the honey wheat crust. Yum!

The best part of the night was the kids fruit cups which consisted of cut up grapes and pineapple. Love the customer service here!

Baltazar P.,"Oceanside, CA",0,7,2,5.0,9/2/2015,Take my daughters to eat at CPK at least once a month.  The food is always delicious and comes out in a reasonable amount of time.  They offer a military discount there so be sure to ask because they don't advertise it.  I wouldn't have known except one nice waitress noticed my tattoo and told me about it.   A great place for lunch with friends and family.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-temecula?start=100

Alex C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,43,11,5.0,5/19/2017,"I went to CPK yesterday and as I was eating I thought to myself, I go here almost monthly and I've never had a bad experience ever. It's reasonably priced, the staff are friendly and the food has always been good. So I sat down to write a positive review. There isn't much more I can say, it's a great place to eat. I usually get the Sicilian pizza with thin crust, the chips and artichoke dip a sprite or root beer and the Carmel cup thing for dessert, it doesn't get any better than that! If you are looking for some good not greasy pizza with some flavor in a sit down environment, this is a good place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-temecula?start=40
Holly F.,"Temecula, CA",0,9,3,1.0,2/13/2016,"I went to this place on a Friday night, not too busy surprisingly. So went got a table outside because it was a nice night. We did that $32 for two deal they had going on which gives you an appetizer, two entrees and a dessert. Sounded decent. My girlfriend and I ordered that and our friend just got an order if their crispy mac and cheese.  We got the spinach artichoke dip, my gf got their bbq chicken pizza, i got a hawaiian pizza and we ordered the key line pie for dessert. The appetizer came out and it was sadly the best part of our meal. The chips were good the dip was good so we had high hopes. Her pizza was alright, but my hawaiian pizza was just nasty. Hardly any sauce and the sauce that was on it has such a flavor that I ended up spitting it out. I ate a few pieces of the ham off the top and just decided to fill up on the dip.  Our friend who got the mac and cheese was deceived by their very poorly written menu. It described the crispy mac and cheese to have panko on top and it worded it in such a way that you would think it would just be a small thing of mac and cheese with panko on top. Nope, they tiny DENSE fried balls of mac and cheese, 4 of them on a plate with the tiniest bit of what I can only explain as cheese whiz drizzled onto the bottom of the plate. They were so small and they had so much breading that they were hard, dense and barely even had any mac and cheese in them at all. She couldn't even eat them.  Our waiter, Andrew, really needs to learn some customer service skills. He came around way too often, didn't ask us if he could take some of our empty dirty plates and he just kept asking us how everything tasted and didn't pick up on our very unenthusiastic tones as we said basically the food was meh. He hovered and just made our already disappointing dinner, awkward. We finally told him the mac and cheese things were gross after my friend asked him for the menu one more time because she wanted to read again the description of the mac and cheese she ordered. She told him that it made it sound different that what she got and that they were really gross. All he said was ""Oh... I'm sorry..."" And then hovered around for a moment before finally walking off... Like uhhhh are you going to offer us anything different or offer to take it off the menu? Nope you just walk off. But he did end up taking it off the check for us which was nice, he just kinda did it so that was nice. I dunno the quality of the food was just completely not worth the price, we got the key lime pie to go and it wasn't even good it tasted store bought. Ughh and they charge 2.99 for soda.... Just not worth the prices at all I will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-temecula?start=40

Nina C.,"Menifee, CA",0,6,,4.0,10/24/2016,Very clean place. Servers were very polite and knowledgeable of menu. Ordered the carne asada pizza and it was delicious! I disagree with one person who gave a review who said you could find this kind of pizza in a frozen food isle at a grocery store. The dough and the crust were light and the pizza had such great flavor. Pricing is okay. Service is good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-temecula?start=40
HW Y.,"San Diego, CA",265,70,95,5.0,11/14/2015,"I don't go to CPK often, but this particular one was above my expectations. I stopped by with my girlfriend because she was craving pasta and had not expected much. But her garlic cream fettuccine was really good. Despite how busy the place was, the pasta came out quick and perfectly done.  Our server/bartender was also very friendly and fast.  Price was decent, $15 for pasta with shrimps. Only one downside was the bread served before her entrée, which felt poorly baked (dry on the outside and slightly doughy flavor inside. The olive dip with herbs was good, though. But I still give them 5 stars for prompt service and food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-temecula?start=40

Carletta S.,"Anza, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/8/2016,"I wanted to take my husband to CPK since he had never been. When we arrived less than half the tables were occupied about 4 in the afternoon.. We were told there would be a 10-15 min wait. We decided to wait. We saw what we thought were 1 or 2 servers, 1 person cleaning and setting up tables a couple of other people walking back and forth to the hostess station. There was someone from management doing an interview with a young lady at a side table. This was all fine but it was hard to understand why we had to wait to be seated. If there were short handed, at least seat us at a table and let us know you are short staffed. after about 10 min sitting in a half empty restaurant, we opted for PF Changs down the walkway.  +",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-temecula?start=40

The California Club pizza with bacon and huge slices of avocado is ALWAYS good... a little pricey for the size, but the quality makes up for it.  The downs? Service is sometimes hit and miss and they don't carry the channel for Laker games!  Place is obviously pretty convenient given that its right in front of the mall.

Chris B.,"Fallbrook, CA",7,16,1,1.0,7/24/2016,"Don't know what's happened to this place! First of all, I wanted cilantro taken off my salad. The server said it was impossible, as it's ""in the salad mix"". Then my daughter's $27.99 ribeye came completely un-cutable. And if needed tons of trimming, since it was 15% fat and gristle. So I took the dull knife to the manager Jim and his answer was ""well it comes that way, trimmed and we can't touch it.""  What?? Attitude was disappointingly apathetic. I guess this is truly fast food, like getting a ribeye at McDonalds. Needless to say we won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-temecula?start=40

Food Is My Love Language H.,"Murrieta, CA",97,54,82,2.0,1/10/2017,"Went to CPK on Saturday night.

She goes, ""Well, we close in 15 minutes."" I assured her we would be ""quick"". *Eyeroll. Our server came over like 60 seconds later and said, ""The hostess said you're ready to order."" There were still like 5 parties in the restaurant and like 10 billion servers. Ok..I'm exaggerating but you'd think in that time my daughter wouldn't have had to ask for a drink refill twice and we wouldn't have had to hunt down staff to get some napkins. My pizza literally came out burnt where I couldn't eat like an eighth of it. So sad when you're sitting there with empty drinks and greasy hands and blondie the hostess can't pipe down about her boyfriend long enough to give her server some help. Cooks off work sat with hoodies on, feet on the walls on their phone by the kitchen and servers sat at the bar while the rest of the patrons, arms flailing around, tried to get service.

This happened on 2/4 occasions :)  +1: availability, I'm happy that cpk is available in most shopping centers and I can always rely on them for a good salad -1: their pizza, when I first started eating at cpk, I was amazed at their creativity but with new places like pieology and other custom pizza, this place is lacking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-temecula?start=40

I've always enjoyed their salads but I have also tried a few of their pizzas, all were delicious which has lead to my return. I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a table.

Jeanine B.,"Canyon Lake, CA",11,32,4,1.0,7/12/2016,"The one star goes to the good service. But we got what looked like a ""bugger"" in the pasta. I did touch it and I will have to say nothing has that kind of consistency but a bugger.   The person who I was with and I both came to the conclusion it could be nothing else. So we communicated it to management and they were great about it and said they would write up a report and give us the credit in it. Also, we ordered the balsamic salad and it was not appealing looking at all, sorry to say. I am the least picky person re: food but I literally could not find the salad appealing enough to stomach it, so I sent it back but didn't ask for a refund.  My daughter got a strawberry shortcake and the strawberries were mushy and grey looking.
