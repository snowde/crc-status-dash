Lillian F.,"Phoenix, AZ",376,72,77,4.0,12/23/2017,"I've been to this location once before and I remember having a pretty good time with friends, and being delightfully surprised at how good the food was. This time, s/o and I decided to get takeout. The online ordering system wasn't working (and wasn't telling us why it wasn't working), so we called in the order. We got a call 7 minutes later (which we missed, unfortunately until 20 minutes later) saying that they didn't have any of s/o's dish, so he had to switch. We get to the location 15 minutes later (as told to), and went to the takeout window, where we stood around for another 15 minutes before someone in the kitchen spotted us and got a server to talk to us. While we waited, I noticed that my pasta was just sitting out on the counter. I'm not positive they have a hot holding space, but I'm assuming they do, and I was a little disappointed my food wasn't  kept hot. S/o and I ended up getting the same thing (Kung Pao-his with spaghetti, mine with fettucine) and although mine was still good, it wasn't as good as his  the Cobb salad was bombbbb though (and I loved the beets!) I did love the little touch of having the seasoned oil in a to go container to go with the bread though :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tempe
Jasmine C.,"Phoenix, AZ",175,853,,4.0,12/3/2017,water was terrible - tasted like it had bleach in it. bread was really good and was brought butter instead of oil when asked. the salad with roasted vegetables was amazingly good. pizza was pretty good and added extra toppings for no added cost. very friendly staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tempe
Manuth P.,"Tempe, AZ",0,8,1,5.0,10/17/2017,"Yelp Review California Pizza Kitchen 2000 E Rio Salado Pakwy Tempe, Arizona 85281 California Pizza Kitchen deserves solid 5 stars. The service I received was amazing for my Friday night with my friends. The Chicken fettucini was amazingly paired up with the amazing Raspberry Lemonade  We arrived around 6:30 pm and the restaurant was relatively packed from a Friday night. We were seated immediately. The server was really polite and very interactive with the menu. I got a Chicken Fettucini with a Raspberry lemonade for my drink. The fettucini was amazing. It was really creamy, cheesy and full of flavor. The chicken breast was perfectly cooked and full of juice. The meat was tender and full of flavor. The quality was top notched and I was not regretting getting the Chicken Fettucini. I ended my night with a Belgian Chocolate Souffle cake and let me tell you that beat all the desert I had had in my life. It was a warm chocolate cake served with Hagen Das vanilla ice cream on top, with the side of sweet whipped cream. The cake was amazing. I split it in half and there came the deliciously melted chocolate lava dripping out and it was delicious. The service was really great. Our drinks were filled up by the time we almost finished them. The server always stopped by to see if we needed anything or how good the food was. The restaurant atmosphere was amazing because the lights were dimly lit, thus giving a very relaxing atmosphere in a very crowded restaurant. The food took almost 15 mintues to get ready which is pretty reasonable for four complex dishes. They also gave us French bread served free-of-charge. The price was absolutely fair for the quality of the amazing food. My total cost was about 25 dollars, tips not included. The Chicken Fettucini cost about 13 dollars.  Overall, I was very happy with my experience with California Pizza Kitchen. The food, service, and the atmosphere were amazing and I will definitely return again.

Aurora O.,"Longmont, CO",72,70,162,5.0,8/23/2017,First time here and it won't be the last!! The service was great! Our waitress Tova was very helpful and welcoming :)  The side salad is so big and yummy! They have many dressing to choose from. Tova gave us great recommendations. The Champagne vinaigrette and cilantro peanut are delicious!  The thin crust spinach and artichoke pizza is a must! The portions were just right and I didn't leave with a gut bomb!!

Karen B.,"Mesa, AZ",2,70,114,5.0,10/2/2017,I came with my 7 year old God-daughter on Saturday about 2pm.  The restaurant was slammed but they found a nice spot for us.  I really appreciated the free wi-fi so that she could play around when she got bored.  I had the GF crust with the Sicilian toppings.  The waitress was super knowledgeable about what is certified and what isn't.  Very accommodating and ensured I really understood what I ordered (Celiac wise).  The manager was very friendly when he came to check.  The Gluten Free crust was some of the best in town.  It actually had a nice crisp on it!!  My God-daughter ate the entire kids pizza!  She loved it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tempe

Michael F.,"Prescott, AZ",67,156,48,4.0,12/18/2017,"After an evening playing games at Dave and Buster's, we were hungry. This was the closest place around. We were promptly seated and we ordered our drinks and meals. I ordered their ribeye steak which was topped with a delicious herb butter. It was slightly under medium rare, but I didn't mind. It was excellent as well as the herbed potatoes that accompanied it. My wife ordered a salad that was great, and the kids finished off a Hawaiian pizza. Everyone was very satisfied. The service was excellent. We will return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tempe
Mary T.,"Glendale, AZ",50,201,303,1.0,7/21/2017,"Came here for my best friends birthday lunch. There was a total of 7 of us.  Our service was HORRIBLE!!!!  Everyone of us but one ordered pizza! (1 large pizza, 2 kids pizzas, and two lunch size pizzas) How long does it take to make pizza???  Before that; we were given drinks (water, lemonade, tea) it took 40 mins before someone came by and asked how we were doing. No water refills, no sugar for the tea was offered so my best friends sister had to wait that long just to enjoy her beverage!  Andrew was our server. He never came by to check on us. The kids ran out of soda, we needed water refills that took a long time to come. When the food was ordered he rushed me. He never updated us on  how long our food would be after we've been waiting for 30+ mins. After we received our food, it took even longer for him to come check on us. Water refills again, our table didn't have silverware or plates or napkins. I wanted some pepper flakes for my pizza etc.  The pizza was good. I had that with the tortilla soup for the lunch combo. The soup was undesired after first try. I didn't even touch it.  The worst part about this visit was that we even told our server it was for a birthday. After they took all of our plates we were left there aimlessly waiting for at-least another 20-30 mins. The kids were getting impatient. By the time everyone started to get up to go ask for the check, Andrew came with ice cream. Set it on the table and honestly that's what we had to wait for? This place has the worst customer service and worst birthday experience anyone could ever imagine. Never again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tempe

Charmayne C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",17,43,41,5.0,2/26/2017,"1st time coming here, family brought me here. I've been skeptical of this place, therefore never trying it.  Well I was wrong,  this place is nice & clean, service was on it's game; our waiter was super patient & sweet & wait time was a bit long I don't mind waiting for my food but some may not have the patience. Nonetheless food was amazing!  I ordered the garlic cream fettuccine $12.99 With shrimp +$5 it was delicious, the plate portion was enough not to big not to small. All in all I had a wonderful experience, definitely be  recommending this joint to everyone & will definitely be coming back!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tempe
Cyn V.,"Scottsdale, AZ",302,260,7,4.0,11/10/2016,Not bad for a pizza chain! We actually order take out from this location and I have yet to come in and eat inside.  We love their Jamaican Jerk Chicken Pizza. The flavors are sweet yet spicy with plenty of flavor. My hubby loves the thin crust. This time we also ordered the Mac-n-Cheese bites as an appetizer and enjoyed the yummy gooey cheesy flavor. This place has definitely made our roster as our take out place. Thank you CPK!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tempe
Faith M.,"Tempe, AZ",12,63,15,1.0,6/25/2017,"I order from them sometimes through doordash, and the order is wrong every single time. CPK blames doordash, and doordash blames CPK. Personally, I believe the restaurant should make sure to give the full and complete order to the carrier. If that's done, then it's pretty difficult for the carrier to mess it up.  After this happened a few times, I spoke with the manager, Jennifer. She said she''d send me a coupon to use for my next meal. She never sent it. You can tell this business doesn't care because they don't reply to any reviews.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tempe

Lloyd B.,"Chandler, AZ",48,226,1,2.0,8/7/2017,"Went on a Sunday evening about 7:30 with my son for a little dinner.  The restaurant was relatively quiet (customers, not noise level!)  Very noisy considering the sparse number of diners.  A five minute wait got us a table and a nice young server who was pleasant and initially attentive.  Our drinks came quickly.  We ordered an appetizer (Szechwan Chicken Dumplings) and their Sicilian regular crust Pizza.  Our server asked if we wanted our appetizer before he served the pizza and we said we did and thanked him for his suggestion.  About 15 minutes later a young lady brings our pizza and places it on the table.  When I told her we were expecting an appetizer, she offered to take the pizza back.  We were hungry and didn't care for the possibility of reheated pizza so we told her we would just keep it.  About 5 minutes later our second server returned with our appetizer which we discovered to just be tepid, probably sitting under the heat lamp for awhile.  Six small dumplings with little flavor to them.  The pizza was a bit dry, could have used more sauce and more cheese despite a fair amount of freshly grated parmesan cheese she grated directly on our pizza.  I would give it a 2.5 and the dumplings a 2 at best.  Our original server returned with our bill, my water was never refilled.  I doubt I will ever try them again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tempe

L.b. S.,"Tempe, AZ",20,2,1,3.0,5/16/2017,"Well, the visit didn't start out well, but It turned around. My mom and I came at lunch because of the gluten free pizza. They have a lunch duo combo with your choice of 7in pizza and a soup or salad. Of course they only have one size of gluten free pizza, 10 inch, and refused to let my mom have the lunch duo.  Also, the water had something floating in it and the appetizer plates were dirty. My mom liked the way that the waiter handled the dirty plate situation. Good point: the seasonal Sam Adams CPK has on draft right now is very tasty. Light on the palate and great for any meal. Throughout the rest of the meal went well, the pizzas were perfectly cooked, and the service was nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tempe

Why do restaurants always want to put us at table near the bathrooms or kitchen??  We ordered their Wild Mushroom pizza and Fish Tacos. The pizza was filled with mushrooms, just the way I like it, but one problem...it was COLD. On the other hand, the Fish Tacos were delicious.

Second of all, we walked in 15 minutes prior to close, thought they closed 30 minutes later than they did. The host went to seat us and we sat down at our table and the waitress came over and told us to leave and that it was too close to closing time and then yelled at the host in front of us and then made a different server serve us.

My brother ordered the fish tacos.  This sadly was nothing to write home about either.

I went in not expecting much to be honest judging from the bland decor and the fact it was very busy. It seemed like just a chain with no MAGIC. Somewhere I would fill my face with carbs and move on to the gig. There was a 40 minute wait so I opted to be served at the bar straight away. From here on my expectations were exceeded as we had extremely fast and polite service even with the restaurant being as busy as a blue arse fly. I got the thin, crispy crust pear and blue cheese pizza which made me giggle with absolute delight as though fairies entered the restaurant and sprinkled the inside of my mouth with delicious magic dust... magic dust which actually just tasted of good pizza. The crust was very well done and made a pleasent change from the carb heavy American deep pan. Then it happened... the Quesadilla starter came out with a sauce that anyone who likes sriracha NEEDS to try. It's ranch... with... wait for it.... SRIRACHA! A mystical Asian/American spell was cast on my taste buds and I promise I will forever cast sriracha on to my ranch for the time I remain a wizard.

My dining companion got the Chicken Tequila Fettucini.  I tried a bite and it was decent, though I didn't taste tequila - just lemon.  Plus the entrée wasn't enough food for him and he was still hungry afterwards.  For $14 you'd think they'd give you a bit more food.... especially since this isn't super high quality food...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tempe?start=60

Matthew D.,"Tempe, AZ",900,664,399,4.0,10/3/2013,"Four things to know about California Pizza Kitchen: 1.  The food is delicious.  I used to call this place ""California Pizza Sh*ttin"" around the year 1999 when I tried the food back then.  I didn't like the taste 14 years ago, but I think their grub is pretty awesome now.  Tasty margherita pizza.  My wife, who had never been to a CPK before, was also very impressed not only with her pizza but also her salad.  My daughter really enjoyed her pasta. 2.  The service is fantastic.  Our waitress was very friendly, helpful, and present--and that's exactly what we needed along with great food at the end of a stressful day. 3.  It ain't cheap.  You don't go here for a bargain.  It won't break your bank, but this is upscale pizza, and a deluxe meal for your family of three could approach $70. 4.  It's LOUD.  Between the music, and people shouting to be heard over the music, this place is updecible and well as upscale.  It's like a warzone soundwise.  Be warned. Great dinner.  The coupon and gift card we had helped a lot with the bill.  Yes, definitely recommended.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tempe?start=60

ImaYelper Y.,"San Diego, CA",55,228,107,3.0,7/18/2013,I was checking in here and noticed the low rating they seemed to be getting and said to my husband 3 stars are they joking?  Have they tasted this food?  They cant be serious I mean have you had the BBQ chicken salad?  Have you tried the habenero pizza?   Those two items just keep us coming back but heres where things start to change and stars start to disappear.  Since Summer hit we can no longer sit outside and enjoy the patio its just too hot so we are forced inside.  The music is so incredibly loud and not just on one visit but the last 5 or 6 visits for that awesome salad we almost wanted to shoot ourselves in the head.   You couldnt have a decent conversation.  We couldnt hear each other.  We asked them to turn it down they did slightly then asked if it was ok and I said honestly no its still not ok its horrible.  They didnt turn it down any more like they should of but thankfully another song came on that wasnt as blaring.  Next few visits we noticed the music is off the charts insanely loud but we didnt want to draw more attention to ourselves we figured lets just get our salad and get the heck outta here.   The next thing that really starts to bother me is their cumbersome approach to a frequent diners card.  You sign up for the pizza dough ap and then they are supposed to load your points sometimes they load them and other times you dont get that lucky.  You have to be a pain in the butt asking about your points if they got it right etc. just not fun and tends to be embarrassing.   They have a new promo get double points til end of July or something but we never get double so they go ask management and management pushes it off on call corporate there is a number on front of pizza dough but there is only a number for them and when you call they blow you off again.   They probably would have retained that 4 star rating I initially gave if they only turn down the music and train all their employees on how pizza dough works oh and the curbside service sucks too wow do they not do a very good job of communicating.  Last two calls went horribly wrong I felt like I was on Candid Camera and these people needed me to help them do their job it was like an Abbot and Costello movie.   I call and say oh I didnt know you delivered it curbside the response is oh yes we do so I check to see if my salad is ready and she says when you pick it up and I say didnt you say you had curbside?  She says oh you want curbside?  (Its 120 degrees outside)  Yes I would like curbside.  She seemed flustered (had her on speaker) husband says screw this I will go in and pick it up.  I have called in orders twice and the communication was so bad both times we HAD to go in and pick it up rather than have them make good on their curbside service.  I guess that was maybe a very interesting way that they have come up with to get out of the 120 degree weather.  It worked!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tempe?start=60

The Thai peanut dressing is fantastic.  Avocado was accidentally put in it (which they offer with an up charge).  It didn't cost us anything since it was a mistake, but I wouldn't recommend paying for it.  Not too much is thrown in, and it tastes out of place in an asian salad.

Once again yelp came to the rescue. After reading many reviews about this place I was very hesitant to dine here. Seeing that we were already at the location and didn't feel like going anywhere else, we decided to get our food fix here. (Boy did I pay for that decision!). The restaurant itself is awesome, had the right lighting, the background music was loud enough to hear but low enough to hear each other talk, and it's an open bar.  After being seated, we were greeted by a very rude waitress (Britni) who took our drink order. Five or so minutes later she came back with our waters and took our order. We ordered the California club pizza and also a peach tea. Fifteen minutes rolls by and no sign of our waitress, our glasses of water were empty, haven't got the peach tea yet (starting to get annoyed). The food runner brought out our ""eye candy"" pizza, Man - O - Man it looked delicious. Keep in mind we still haven't got the peach tea yet, with our waitress nowhere to be found I waved down another waitress, who kindly stopped and asked if we needed anything.  Ask her if she could get us a side of ranch and our peach tea we ordered 20 or so minutes ago. She apologized and said she'll be right out with it. Soon after she had left ""OUR"" waitress (Britni) shows up and ask if we needed anything. In my mind I was thinking (OMG are you for reals! Where the hell have you been!). Asked her about our peach tea and asked her for a refill on my water.  She reply's back ""Oh, I totally forgot about the peach tea"".  No apology what so ever. The peach tea FINALLY came out after we were done with our pizza.To top it off she charged us for the troubled peach tea. Aside from the horrible waitress the pizza was awesome and full of flavor.

The place looked the same, had more or less the same menu, and thought it would be business as usual.  We started off with some of their ""small cravings"" ... a little menu showcasing new smaller sides to share or enjoy before a meal. The Korean Beef Tacos looked interesting so we gave them a shot. Lets just say the only thing we were craving was our four dollars back after ordering them. Sure, cover anything in enough sauce it will taste okay. However, after eating a lot of tacos the past two weeks (been on the road traveling through CA), my money would have been better spent at Filli-anything or even Del Taco.  The main course was average, but it felt very commercially produced. No real flavor or excitement, just food.

It has been a few months since I last enjoyed a meal at the ol' CPK.  This is easily my favorite pizza joint in the valley.  They have a wide selection of pizzas to fit every palate.  If you're not in the mood for pizza, don't fret!  They have plenty of Pastas, Salads, Sandwiches, and more to make everybody happy. Another real treat for me is their cocktail menu.  They serve some very fresh drinks that are a step above the norm.  Last night, I had their Plum Martini, which was delicious.  I could not even taste the alcohol... It literally tasted like I was drinking directly from a plum.  Delicious! My meal of choice is their Barbecue Chicken Pizza.  It used to be just another pizza on the menu, but right now, they seem to really be focusing on that one, so it does not feel as special.  If you are looking at their menu, they Bold it, highlight it in red, add a remark about it being ""Their Classic Pizza"", and so on and so forth... Let's not go over the top, guys.  It's a great pizza, but give the right amount of credit, and don't blow it out of proportion. The desserts here are also fantastic.  Yesterday, I sampled their Strawberry Shortcake, which is a plate of fresh strawberries, whipped cream, and a piping hot biscuit served on a cool plate.  Exquisite. After reading all this, you may be asking yourself:  Why is the rating only Three Stars?  Here's why. This place is expensive.  All of their food items are marked up at least 25% higher than what it should be.  The Barbecue Chicken Pizza would be great if it were, say, $10.  Here, it's $13.  The Plum Martini?  $8.50.  The Strawberry Shortcake?  $7.00.  This meal ran me $30, and that's without the tip.  I do not agree that the prices should be so high.   The food?  Fantastic.  The price?  It's way too high.  Overall Score?  3 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tempe?start=120

I am a fan of a few of their salads because I am trying to be a bit healthier but after reviewing the nutritional information of most of their salads I realize I am doing more harm than good.  Last night I had the CPK Cobb and it was just ok.  Another salad I enjoy is the BBQ chicken one.

Christoph S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",96,6,2,3.0,6/1/2008,"Originally the plan was to have dinner at Maria Maria with the family. The wait for a table on a Saturday evening was too long, besides my three year old was starving and demanded mac & cheese, so we decided to move on.  Strolling through Tempe Marketplace we found ourselves in front of California Pizza Kitchen, looking through the glass of the door we could see that there was no wait, and that is exactly what we needed. Walking in the door we promptly got greeted by a very friendly hostess and we got seated immediately  with  crayons ready for my little one. Here is what we ordered: Thai Crunch Salad, Carne Asada Pizza and Curly Mac n' Cheese.  Generally I am not a fan of big franchise concepts but I have to say that the quality of the food was excellent considering it comes out of  a ""system kitchen"".  At first I was not so sure about Carne Asada on a Pizza but it was surprisingly good. National favorites of two soccer-crazy countries, that had to go together. The Thai Crunch Salad was quite good as well and probably for the first time I noticed that all the ingredients mentioned on a menu item were actually in the dish. But perhaps that is just the way CPK designs an writes their menu. My little boy also approved the mac and cheese. On a side note we ordered one Maragrita (Cuervo gold tequila, not blended) and it was done well, but then how hard is it to screw up a Margarita? Over all we were very satisfied with our dinner at CKP, we got to sit down on a Saturday evening without waiting, the food came out quickly and the young waiter was very friendly.  If I could rate this California Pizza Kitchen with 3.5 stars then I really would. The only thing I was not so fond of is that the check arrived at the table too quickly.

Stephanie S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",77,239,6,3.0,1/19/2008,"Another chain restaurant opens its doors among a sea of unoriginal yet conveniently located establishments comprising ""The District"" at the Tempe Marketplace.  Like many other all-ages locales, this place was frequented by many high school-aged kids on a recent Friday night.  As I approached the restaurant I noticed couples and groups sitting outside on a dark and unheated patio.  I then went inside and joined more people waiting in a drafty and seemingly unheated entranceway.  After waiting about 30 minutes - which seemed to correspond with the time I was quoted - my friend and I were seated at a blustery table near the door.  Brr - my light jacket was no match for the draft, so we asked the first person who approached the table whether we could possibly move somewhere further from the door.  In spite of several visible open tables, she made a face and said those tables were going to be taken by larger parties, and we would have to check with the hostess.  The hostess pleasantly moved us to a table much further from the doorway but somehow the draft still wafted over there even though this table was close to the open kitchen (weird).  Still, it was definitely an improvement, and this time I kept my mouth shut.   The waiter approached the table quickly enough and took our drink orders (water for me and lemonade for my friend).  He swiftly brought the drinks and the bread (which not especially fresh, warm, or flavorful, but who really needs bread as a prequel to pizza anyway?).  After sipping our drinks and helping ourselves to a slice of the aforementioned bread simply because it was there, my companion and I sat and talked and waited about 20 minutes for the pizza and salad to arrive (in CPK's defense, my friend was the one who not so brilliantly suggested bringing the two items at the same time, as opposed to having the salad first).  The waiter remarked, ""Finally, right?"" while delivering the food, and when we responded ""Yeah..."" he replied, ""Hey, it's not my fault!""  If even the waiter is commenting on how long it took, shouldn't there be some offer of a free dessert, or at least an explanation of what the hell was going on back there?  But we didn't dwell on that -- we were too busy shoveling Chinese Chicken Salad and the trademark Barbeque Chicken Pizza - with honey wheat dough, of course - onto our plates.  The food was good - consistent with other CPK experiences, which after all is the goal when visiting a tried and true chain restaurant.  The waiter presented the bill while asking if we wanted dessert as an afterthought.  To his credit, he remembered to get our salad dressing on the side, refilled our drinks before they were totally empty, and timed my friend's to go order of mac n' cheese just right.   The draftiness, the bad table assignment, and the rather long wait time for the food probably would not make this a very smooth choice for a date, in my opinion, but it did the job for me and an old friend enjoying a rare low-key evening.  All in all, this was about what I had expected and would consider going back the next time I'm at Tempe Marketplace for a movie with a friend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tempe?start=140

Andrea C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",3,25,5,1.0,8/17/2013,"Very slow service on a Saturday afternoon with only 1/2 the restaurant full. Two of us ordered our pizzas before another friend came. The third person came at least 15min after we ordered and had to wait for our waiter to put his order in.  After about 30min from our initial order, the manager came over and said our order was ""getting sorted out""--which was the first we'd heard of an issue. Our pizzas finally all came out together, still with no apology or even acknowledgement from our waiter that there had been some kind of issue. We left Tempe Marketplace after finishing and while at another store, I realized that I didn't have my Visa from CPK. I realized that the waiter never gave it back. So I had to take our entire party back to Tempe Marketplace, park, and walk back on a 110 degree day.  When I got there, I told the woman at the front desk that the waiter hadn't returned my card. She told me to get out my ID and someone would be with me. Then she turned and did a walk through the restaurant, filling water, collecting plates, etc without telling anyone that we were waiting. Eventually, the manager came out and just handed back my card, with no apology for the waiter keeping the card to begin with.  I should have known better than to go to a chain restaurant and I have been reminded again why I don't.

Cris L.,"Glendale, AZ",101,13,1,4.0,8/25/2017,"So we had an interesting experience. It went from average to bad to good to average. Really up and down. I think we might've had a new server. There were 3 of us and they gave us one drink menu so we were sharing it. We placed it on the center of the table and While we were looking at it, the server just came and dropped a plate of bread right in the middle of the table on the menu we were looking at. Just drops it and walks a way. We all looked up at each other. While we were waiting for our drinks (a long time) a manager brought us an appetizer welcoming us as first timers. Still waiting for drinks. Then our food came, still waiting for drinks. Finally our drinks came, then another manager came by and offered to discount our food, we were thankful. One of the drinks was an odd one, the CPK signature drink so my friend sent it back. And ordered wine instead. Our server never came back around to ask us for more drinks or how was everything. Management did. However we managed to get another round of drinks in when he came over to leave the check which he had to reprint because he never came back to see if we wanted another round. Lol. So this is why I think the server was new. Good job to management for the follow-up and TIP: your server needs to be more aware of what's going on at each table. And pay attention to the order, example: server didn't remember who ordered what drink, drops the appetizers directly in front of each one of us without notice or excusing his reach. WE had to start moving plates around pushing water glasses to the side to make room in the middle for pizza and appetizers instead of dropping them under our noses. He was very detached. But I will say management was very attentive, apologetic and turned it around to make it a positive experience.

The flatbread was probably our favorite. The salad had so much potential but you can tell the strawberries had been sitting around in liquid for awhile. They were pale and mushy. Mmmmm....and for just over $10 it was a total waste of $. We picked off the strawberries and ate a $10 romaine & feta salad with 4 balls of watermelon on it. The BBQ pizza was perfectly OK - I liked the abundance of cilantro, hubby wished it had more zip from BBQ sauce. The flatbread was killer. Crisp, chewy, savory. Oh - normally I order a club soda and receive it at no charge (it is literally just carbonated water...) but here I was charge $2+.

We arrived and were seated pretty fast, it was around 12:30ish on a Saturday afternoon. Our server was Faith, and she was good at making sure our table was taken care of! Now about 8 years ago I found my favorite pizza, the BBQ Chicken Pizza, it changed the way I thought of pizza, no longer did I think that pizza had to have a tomato base sauce, and to this day, I still love my bbq chicken pizza to be bbq sauce, cheese, chicken, red onions & cilantro, but I noticed on the menu right under the original bbq chicken, they had an Hawaiian BBQ Chicken it's just like the original, but with fresh pineapples added to it. OMG I love the combo of chicken and pineapples, so that's what I ordered, and let me tell you, it was perfectly delicious!   I also saw they had a small dish that was White Corn Guacamole, that had sweet white corn, diced avocado, black beans, jicama, bell peppers, cilantro & serrano peppers with white & blue corn tortilla chips.

Lauren F.,"Tempe, AZ",564,279,610,2.0,8/30/2014,"For Christmas, my boyfriend and I received movie tickets and a gift card to CPK for a fun movie date night. We decided to make the plan happen one night and were excited to get out, as we hadn't been to the movies in a long time.  We decided to sit at the bar at CPK because we were watching the World Cup. The bar area is probably not the most popular spot in the whole restaurant, because it only sits like 10 patrons, but we took a chance. Our bartender was a little strange. He mentioned that he doesn't drink repeatedly and it made ordering drinks a little awkward. At one point, we ordered a lemon drop shot and we asked if he could make them. He said they had a martini and he could just pour it into two glasses. Sure. Ok. Fine. I guess that works. It turns out he made each one of us a martini in a rocks glass and charged us for two martinis. This is not what we asked for. And next time, we'll just ask for a table so the bartender who doesn't drink won't make us feel weird about ordering drinks. I believe our meal was good, I just can't get over the lemon drop shot/martini confusion. I don't mind if someone who works as a bartender doesn't drink, but they should know how to make drinks, which is their job. Part of what you're paying for when you go out is the experience and it kind of ruins it when the situation gets weird.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tempe?start=40

While the place is usually packed and wait time on a Saturday night varies between 30-45mins, service is usually decent and the tables and utensils are always clean.  A short wait isn't so bad in the company of great friends.  Food is pretty standard affair.  In the end, you're really just paying for the name and a standard pizza with fresh ingredients.  My usual go-to's are the Thai Chicken hand tossed, Tostada thin crust, and the Garlic cream Fettuccine.  Yum.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tempe?start=40
