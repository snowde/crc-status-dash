Alison Y.,"Spring, TX",204,169,683,4.0,12/26/2017,"Typically, I am not a chain kinda gal, ya know? I hold fast to that, every time someone suggest California Pizza kitchen, I am reluctant to go. Every time! And every time I am proven wrong and pleasantly surprised by the spot.   The menu is great! They truly have something for everyone! I love the numerous sections for healthy eaters or vegetarians.    What I love about this spot is obviously, the menu and here are a few other things.. they have a valet right out front. They have tons of seating so you will never wait for a table. Service is always great. They have outdoor seating for nice days. They also have a little outdoor area if your kiddos need to walk a bit.    What I don't love is the cocktails, they are always so sweet. I also do not love the size of the pizzas, a large is quite small. Other than that, this is a great family spot.    We homeschool, I always have my kiddos with me. When out running errands I know this will be a convenient crowd pleasing spot, even if I am reluctant to drop my no chains attitude. When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie... enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-the-woodlands

Hope they spend more time training their staff... Probably will not be back to this location ---great opportunity to try other eateries on this strip.

Rachel L.,"Spring, TX",18,173,,3.0,11/29/2017,"Good restaurant, good food, good service. The only thing that keeps this review from four stars is that I think it's a little pricey for what you get. We always get the bbq chicken pizza which is really good and if you've never had it, you need to get it. Chicken, red onions, bbq sauce and mozzarella cheese. We also get the chicken Milanese which is breaded and pan fried chicken topped with arugula, diced tomatoes, Parmesan cheese and they give you a lemon wrapped in cheesecloth to squeeze over the top. I think they give complementary bread to the tables, but we weren't offered any. And we probably didn't need any with all the pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-the-woodlands
Barbara P.,"The Woodlands, TX",79,104,214,4.0,1/21/2017,"I love California pizza kitchen, being someone who hates gooey cheesy pizza ( I know! Shoot me now) it's hard for me to find a place that caters to my love of crust and toppings but also recognizes my disdain for melted cheese. I ordered the California club pizza which comes with arugula, bacon, chicken, avocado, romaine lettuce and a cilantro cream sauce for the topping. This pizza was perfect! Crisp crust, juicy chicken, not too much cheese but the perfect combination of spice and cool flavors. My girlfriend ordered the pepperoni and sausage pizza which comes with handmade spicy sausage. The flavors of that meat made me think of Sicily. Our server was awesome. She took time to suggest drinks we should try, and just had a great demeanor our entire visit. This place is in a great location ok ""Restaurant Row"" in Hughes Landing.  Tip: after you leave, head to your right and pick up some macaroons for dessert from Macaroons by Patisse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-the-woodlands
Aisha F.,"Houston, TX",0,19,4,5.0,10/18/2017,"California pizza kitchen is by far the best restaurant that I have probably been to that actually genuinely takes care of their customers. There were a couple of huge parties at their restaurants and we had to wait for about two hours for our food and the owner was extremely friendly and kind and she apologized and paid for our food. I have never had this experience before and I can positively say that the waiting was a bit annoying but they were extremely accommodating.  As for the food, it was awesome. I have never had pizza like this ever. It was fresh and start out of the oven. They have a great variety of dishes on their menu and it comes in reasonably priced large portions. Great for brunch or dinner with kids.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-the-woodlands
B A.,"The Woodlands, TX",5,36,14,1.0,9/16/2017,Man they must be killing it. I stopped by at 10:30 to order a few pizzas and a group of workers were sitting at a table as I walked in. I said are you opened. They all looked at each other and said no we aren't. To say the very least I will not be back.

Alison L.,"Houston, TX",113,159,49,4.0,6/9/2017,"I feel guilty liking a chain. The lunch deals are great though and you can get in and out quicker than other spots in the area.  The lunch menu can get pretty caloric as a ""lunch pizza"" alone is 600+ calories without the side salad or sandwich. I recently discovered the ""half salad"" option from the regular menu which also serves as a nice lunch option- solid portion less than 12 dollars.   There's a nice patio out back overlooking Hughes waterway and on a nice day it's perfect for a drink or outdoor lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-the-woodlands
Bunny G.,"The Woodlands, TX",840,1160,3986,4.0,6/25/2016,CPK was our go-to back home so when they finally opened a restaurant in Hughes Landing we were excited to go and eat our favorite dishes. The Thai pizza is hands down a unique blend of flavors. Its so delicious and I hope they never take this off the menu.  Our pepperoni pizza was burnt so the chef was kind enough to come out and apologize and fix us a new one for free!   Service was friendly and food was yummy.

Wait staff were super efficient, they even did separate checks for us all!! It was my first visit here and was impressed by menu, expected just pizza maybe a few other items. WRONG, menu is quite varied. I had the buffalo cauliflower, my new fave food, just need the recipe (hint, hint!) it was so good!

Henry P.,"Stamford, CT",2,51,,3.0,9/10/2017,"This would be a five star review except for one thing.  The size of the pizza is ridiculously small.  I thought everything was bigger in Texas!!  It is basically a personal size pizza so if you are used to ordering for a family just double what you would normally get and you will be fine....and broke. We ordered a half size grilled vegetable salad and a mushroom pizza and it was $30.00.   As I said, if I doubled the order it would have been the right amount of food.  As for the actual food - pretty good.  Crust was crispy on outside and chewy on the inside ( which is the way it's supposed to be Texas!!) and the mushrooms were good and tasteful Even though the food is good I don't think I will be going back as I don't like to have to go out to eat after I go out to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-the-woodlands

Cam T.,"Houston, TX",1,2,,5.0,5/13/2017,Im going to start this review off with saying the food on 5/11/17  was 2 star Quality but the service displayed by our server Dre made up for it. From the time we sat down to the time we left he had us laughing. Dre is a very funny young man and even when we complained about our food being burnt he apologized and cracked a joke about how it was his fault because he was too hot.

Eli B.,"Houston, TX",5,14,13,3.0,8/19/2017,"When we first got there a very unfriedly, long faced hostess told us it would take 15 mins to be sitted. After the 15 mins she called us for a table in a very rude way, almost mad, to the point I wanted to ask if she was ok. We got to our table and had a really nice young lady as our server.  Our dinner was ok. We have visited other locations and had some of the same items. We were informed that pizza was gonna take a little longer than usual, I was ok with that and the server made sure we had bread and drinks. Also the other items my family ordered were already there at our table. Eventually my pizza came, but to my dissapoitment it was cold, so I didn't enjoyed it much. Server offered to warm it up  when I mentioned to her, but it was kinda late and I didn't wanna wait when my family had alread finished eating. I also ordered a grilled vegetables salad that I didn't enjoy much either as it had a lot of dressing. I shared with my husband and he thought the same. The dressing didn't allow us to enjoy the salad. It had too much dressing, it was overwhelming. Over all the visit was ok. Three things to sum it all up: 1.Terrible hostess, no smile, just plain annoyed face and rude.  2.Great server 3.meh food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-the-woodlands

There seasonal menu consists of everything but pizza and I was ok with that.  The California Fields Salad, Fire-grilled Ribeye, Hearth Roasted Halibut and the Chicken Picatta were all delicious, but the best part was their new cocktail program. The new cocktails: Executive Decision, California Roots and the Blueberry Ginger Smash are all worth a try.

Huawei C.,"Houston, TX",35,5,,3.0,10/17/2015,"We liked CPK when we were in California, and the one in Galleria area was good too. So I can't wait to try this new CPK in the woodlands area.  The restaurant is right at the bank of Lake Woodlands, and the lake view is nice. However the food was kind of disappointing. I ordered the original BBQ pizza, with pineapple. The taste was OK, but the pizza was burnt (the back of the pizza was almost all black). The pineapple was cut in pretty big size, which was a little weird to me.

Our waiter was great, but he was triple sat, which meant no drinks, napkins, etc the entire visit.  The BBQ CHOP salad was good as expected.  The pizza was a bust.

Franklin C.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,3/3/2017,"We went here for diner and I was craving some pizza. They told us it was a 20 min wait which was okay since it was Friday. 30 minutes later we ask how much longer and they say it's almost ready. It took 45 minutes to get a table and we ended up getting seated at a table that was open since the time we got there (I could see plenty of tables open from the moment we walked in). While we were waiting, it seemed that everyone coming in after was getting seated before us. There reasoning was they called ahead. I believe some people did but it seemed like it was highly unlikely everyone did call ahead. The food was okay but my mojito was really good.

Traci F.,"Spring, TX",0,3,,1.0,2/3/2017,"I am writing this review from a restaurant next door to California Pizza Kitchen. We came to the restaurant as a family of 5 and were treated so rudely by the ""hostesses"", before we were even seated, that we left. It is expensive to take a big family out to eat, so being treated with disrespect is not acceptable. The restaurant was practically empty, there were at least 4 tables to accommodate us, and the hostesses would not seat us, instead saying it would be a 10 minute wait. When I asked why, when there were available tables right in front of us that would be fine, I was given a blank stare and just repeatedly told that it would be 10 minutes. When we decided to leave, the ""hostesses"" mocked us as we left. I highly recommend Escalantes, who seated us immediately despite being twice as crowded as CPK, were very friendly, and the food was great. There are too many restaurants in The Woodlands to choose from to be treated poorly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-the-woodlands?start=40

So paid cash then checked balance and it was deducted.  The manager did fix this but the 15% ""bonus"" is only good for January/February not much good for me as I'll be out of town.   My fault for not asking to see the details first Would not give a recommendation for lunch here until they settle things down there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-the-woodlands?start=40

We tried a combination of appetizers that were just ok, avocado egg rolls, lettuce wraps, spinach dip. The mahi tacos, could be much better, they had very hard pieces of fried breading, and didn't like the flour tortilla for it. Kids had pastas, they were very simple and not worth the value, plus they did not include the drinks. Service was slow, our waitress tried her best, but the kitchen was really slow.

Luckily the food backs the service up enough for people to return. We were brought our meals with no plates, and had to ask two different servers for them along with refills. I have been a bartender for a long time, and in order for you to make money you have to at least take decent care of guests. A true lack of customer service and a welcoming attitude.

I end up cancelling our pizza since I have noticed its about closing time and a lot of customers are also complaining . I guess that will be the last time we will be going to CPK and i will tell my friends and family how bad CPK is.

WRONG, menu is quite varied. I had the buffalo cauliflower, my new fave food, just need the recipe (hint, hint!) it was so good! Everyone seemed to enjoy their dish and looking around the tables was impressed by diversity, all looking great!

Henry P.,"Stamford, United States",2,51,,3.0,10/9/2017,"This would be a five star review except for one thing.  The size of the pizza is ridiculously small.  I thought everything was bigger in Texas!!  It is basically a personal size pizza so if you are used to ordering for a family just double what you would normally get and you will be fine....and broke. We ordered a half size grilled vegetable salad and a mushroom pizza and it was $30.00.   As I said, if I doubled the order it would have been the right amount of food.  As for the actual food - pretty good.  Crust was crispy on outside and chewy on the inside ( which is the way it's supposed to be Texas!!) and the mushrooms were good and tasteful Even though the food is good I don't think I will be going back as I don't like to have to go out to eat after I go out to eat.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-the-woodlands

Our dinner was ok. We have visited other locations and had some of the same items. We were informed that pizza was gonna take a little longer than usual, I was ok with that and the server made sure we had bread and drinks. Also the other items my family ordered were already there at our table. Eventually my pizza came, but to my dissapoitment it was cold, so I didn't enjoyed it much. Server offered to warm it up  when I mentioned to her, but it was kinda late and I didn't wanna wait when my family had alread finished eating. I also ordered a grilled vegetables salad that I didn't enjoy much either as it had a lot of dressing. I shared with my husband and he thought the same. The dressing didn't allow us to enjoy the salad. It had too much dressing, it was overwhelming. Over all the visit was ok.

Lindsay S.,"Division No. 15, Canada",1,11,,2.0,21/12/2015,"Very disappointing. I came here with my mother to get take out gluten free pizza, as we both have celiac issues. The service was very good, but once we arrived home and opened the boxes we discovered that both gluten free pizzas were horribly burnt, black around the edges and very dry. We had also picked up a regular pizza for my father, his was perfect and he said it tasted great.  I'll give them two stars for the service and the pizza that was enjoyed, but the gluten free pizzas were very disappointing. I do not expect a gluten free pizza to be identical in taste and texture to a regular pizza, but I do expect it to be edible, not burnt and not dried out.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-the-woodlands?start=60

Sadly, it was not the same. Missing were the large shaved pieces of fresh Parmesan and the anchovy. Even the romaine tasted a bit bitter. Very disappointed.

Kat N.,"Spring, United States",6,13,1,5.0,8/9/2015,"Let me just begun by saying how beautiful this location is...I was so excited for a CPK to be in the Woodlands, for I frequently would visit the location in River Oaks, but the Woodlands location blows the former out of the water! Absolutely beautiful restaurant. I love the colors, wood paneling, every little detail. I especially love the photographs highlighting a bit of Texas AND California. The wait staff was highly attentive and asked if this was my first time dining at CPK. I explained I had been to the RO location many times. The GM (I believe) came out later with a comp'd appetizer welcoming my party to this location and to the dining experience at the Woodlands CPK. My service was great, my pasta was fantastic, the store was packed but my service was fast and friendly. I have gone back one time since this occurrence and I once again received excellent service. This is a restaurant I will happily dine at time and time again!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-the-woodlands?start=60
Janice M.,"Humble, United States",0,2,,1.0,9/2/2016,"I went to this location on January 22nd and ordered a chinese chicken salad to go. The cost was about $15. I was stunned with what I received. Basically, a bowl of bagged lettuce with a few thinly sliced pieces of chicken. I truly could have bought this at grocery store for less than $3. I was furious so I sent a complaint on the California Pizza Kitchen's corporate website. Never heard back from them. What a joke.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-the-woodlands?start=60

Our food came out in an appropriate time. It was delicious!  I had the shrimp scampi zucchini. Fresh vegetables, perfectly cooked pasta. The most pleasurable meal I've had out in a long time!

So I can't wait to try this new CPK in the woodlands area.  The restaurant is right at the bank of Lake Woodlands, and the lake view is nice. However the food was kind of disappointing. I ordered the original BBQ pizza, with pineapple. The taste was OK, but the pizza was burnt (the back of the pizza was almost all black). The pineapple was cut in pretty big size, which was a little weird to me.  So 2 stars for the food, and 1 star for the lake view.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-the-woodlands?start=40

Our waiter was great, but he was triple sat, which meant no drinks, napkins, etc the entire visit.  The BBQ CHOP salad was good as expected.  The pizza was a bust. We got a thin crust pizza that was chewy... Have had better pizza out of the freezer... Manager walked around restaurant aimlessly, never once checked on our table.

Franklin C.,"Houston, United States",0,2,,1.0,3/3/2017,"We went here for diner and I was craving some pizza. They told us it was a 20 min wait which was okay since it was Friday. 30 minutes later we ask how much longer and they say it's almost ready. It took 45 minutes to get a table and we ended up getting seated at a table that was open since the time we got there (I could see plenty of tables open from the moment we walked in). While we were waiting, it seemed that everyone coming in after was getting seated before us. There reasoning was they called ahead. I believe some people did but it seemed like it was highly unlikely everyone did call ahead. The food was okay but my mojito was really good.

Traci F.,"Spring, United States",0,3,,1.0,3/2/2017,"I am writing this review from a restaurant next door to California Pizza Kitchen. We came to the restaurant as a family of 5 and were treated so rudely by the ""hostesses"", before we were even seated, that we left. It is expensive to take a big family out to eat, so being treated with disrespect is not acceptable. The restaurant was practically empty, there were at least 4 tables to accommodate us, and the hostesses would not seat us, instead saying it would be a 10 minute wait. When I asked why, when there were available tables right in front of us that would be fine, I was given a blank stare and just repeatedly told that it would be 10 minutes. When we decided to leave, the ""hostesses"" mocked us as we left. I highly recommend Escalantes, who seated us immediately despite being twice as crowded as CPK, were very friendly, and the food was great. There are too many restaurants in The Woodlands to choose from to be treated poorly.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-the-woodlands?start=40

So paid cash then checked balance and it was deducted.  The manager did fix this but the 15% ""bonus"" is only good for January/February not much good for me as I'll be out of town.   My fault for not asking to see the details first Would not give a recommendation for lunch here until they settle things down there!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-the-woodlands?start=40

The california club pizza its very good, its a salad on top of a pizza with a very nice crust bread. We tried a combination of appetizers that were just ok, avocado egg rolls, lettuce wraps, spinach dip. The mahi tacos, could be much better, they had very hard pieces of fried breading, and didn't like the flour tortilla for it. Kids had pastas, they were very simple and not worth the value, plus they did not include the drinks. Service was slow, our waitress tried her best, but the kitchen was really slow.

Bethany W.,"Spring, United States",0,2,,1.0,30/12/2015,"I had read a lot of negative reviews on here, but decided to try it out regardless. Had a party of 16, it took 30 minutes for us to be seated (even though we had called ahead and reserved a table) and when finally seated we had to sit at 4 different tables as they couldn't put the tables together according to the manager. The food took about an hour for it to come out, extremely slow service for drinks, bread etc. The food was average, but EXTREMELY over priced for what we received. The worst part about this place is the manager. Extremely rude. He threatened to fine our party $500 as someone had pulled up a chair to the table (so more people could sit together). When one party member received the wrong food, our waitress said ""do not talk to the manager, he won't help you. Just don't order it next time"" Evidently, he spoke to the manager who was a male.. Not sure his name. He was EXTREMELY rude and said the same thing. NEVER COME TO THIS PLACE! Seriously not worth it!!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-the-woodlands?start=80
