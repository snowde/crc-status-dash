Shannon W.,"Beaverton, OR",37,6,,4.0,11/28/2017,"This is a great option in Bridgeport for lunch. The lunch menu has many options for people with many different tastes. Their soups usually includes a vegetarian option. The veggie sandwich is a yummy option as well. The prices are fairly reasonable, and the service is terrific.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard
Amelia E.,"Beaverton, OR",25,9,,1.0,7/30/2017,"I work at the mall so I placed my order online so when my husband met me for lunch the food would already be done. When I asked if we could just pay and sit down the man checking me out became incredibly rude and told me ""we frown upon that"" I think he was joking.. and then he was like .. ""no really you take up serving space""  Please note this place is extremely overpriced for what you get and I was still paying.. so I don't understand why we couldn't sit, especially when the inside was almost dead.  I forgot to add a soda and he acted like it was the end of the freakin world.  Get your shit together bro.  Worst service ever. There are so many better places to eat. Walk over to pastini's don't waste your time on these assholes",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard
Derek I.,"Portland, OR",183,352,75,2.0,7/13/2017,"Uninspired and poorly executed. Come here if you want mediocre food. One of the new pastas was a strazapeti with wild mushrooms. If you really want to make it better, add shrimp. Heck, add new noodles, new sauce and all new ingredients. Throw out the original and boom - something edible.  My wife's Cajun jambalaya was mediocre and the ""sauce"" tasted like burned/charred spices. It's not worth coming here. Go to any one of the other restaurants in this mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard
J. D.,"Happy Valley, OR",18,25,32,4.0,11/18/2017,"Pizza options on toppings is a great selection! The crust is not thick nor too thin, so, you're not filling up on the crust but the ingredients. The manager stopped by to greet us after our meal (always shows professionalism and care when they do this).

Mikhail H.,"Beaverton, OR",1528,1085,1765,3.0,6/22/2017,"There are two things which you should know about this place: 1.) Their food is actually damn good. I have tried many things from pizza, salads, appetizers and entrees...I have a favorite sandwich/salad combo. 2.) They have some of the world's worst service. Take out is not a bad option - just double check your order. We went here for a dinner before going to a movie. Thank God we had over two hours to kill since that was how long our food took....no exaggeration. Everything was very good. We started with a magarita pizza in lieu of an appetizer - just tell them to do that if you cannot find something awesome. I still want to try their amazing looking guac but my husband unfortunately hates guac so please give that one a go on my behalf! The pizza was grand though and they really do have a perfectly paper thin crust piled high with cheese. Next up were our entrees which took nearly an hour to get which was just crazy. Getting my correct drink took an insane amount of time - apparently I was thwarted by diet Coke! I had the halibut which was quite good. My husband did a soup and salad which he loved. I do like the amount of diversity in their menu - also that you can order based on how much food you do or don't want. We were trying to kill a lot of time before seeing a movie. Next up was strawberry shortcake ala mode...OMG, it was amazing!! Their shortcakes are skillfully made - perfectly flaky with such a great flavor!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard
Sam K.,"Tualatin, OR",0,3,,5.0,10/12/2017,"My first time visiting was a fantastic experience! Diane (I believe that was our servers name) was so nice. I asked her if there was a lunch special and told her it was my first visit. Well, she not only explained the menu, but told the head chef whom personally came out and introduced himself and gave me a free appetizer! Great service, food was great and they kept topping my coffee!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard
Theresa C.,"Portland, OR",133,55,445,3.0,1/16/2017,"First of all service was great. Ordered CPK bbq pizza, and chicken lettuce wraps. The bbq pizza was good. The chicken lettuce wrap portion shrunk quite a bit from previous visits, awful. The lettuce used to be served looking just like half a head of lettuce. This time around it came neatly cut into the size of 4 wonton wrappers. Which makes a bigger mess when you top it off with chicken, and try to eat it. Please go back to your old ways, and don't mess with the lettuce. It was perfect the way it was before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard
Martin F.,"Oregon City, OR",170,497,178,4.0,1/1/2017,"We went to a place called a Pizza Kitchen and had a great meal without ordering a single pizza! The description of the Sesame Chicken Dumplings drew me in: ""Chinese dumplings topped with sesame seeds and scallions. Served with our soy-ginger chili sauce."" I was a bit disappointed that they were steamed not fried (I found the dough a bit ""doughy"" / undercooked), and the soy-ginger chili sauce was very tasty but as it was not served on the side / rather drizzled over the dumplings I found myself mopping up the platter with one of the dumplings to get enough. I had a peach tea to go with the meal, it was fresh tea and enough peach to notice but not so heavy as to over power.  The wife had a berry sangria and we both agreed it was very, very tasty. We split a large Thai Crunch salad, with the quac on the (wife's) side.  I enjoyed the combination of elements, next time I'll ask for more won ton strips.   We also split a large potato and bacon soup - very tasty. The service was very good and we were brought some terrific crusty bread, oil and vinegar to go with the soup and salad, a really perfect pairing.  The place is really comfortable, I like the decor and felt very welcomed there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard
Marcus G.,"Portland, OR",0,26,13,3.0,1/7/2017,"I am a return customer for CPK. My go to is the BBQ chicken chop salad. The salad is great but the advertising/marketing is misleading. I was asked if I wanted a ""lunch menu"" and agreed come to find out the lunch specials are only during the week. So would you just hand me a food menu instead of leading me to believe I was eligible for a lunch special?  Also, I am not sure if there is a high demand for avacados and low supply but I was surprised to pay $3.00 for a quarter of an avocado.  All in all decent food, not the best customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard

Alex K.,"Portland, OR",7,25,2,5.0,10/15/2017,"I went here for Saturday night dinner with my wife and three kids. Service was prompt and extremely friendly. They had a nice selection of beers and even apple cider. I got the Carne Asada pizza and my wife got the Caesar salad. The kids got pizza, grilled chicken and mac & cheese.  Sometimes chain restaurants are dull, uninspired, not clean and with mediocre service.

Ariel A.,"Denver, CO",49,3,1,1.0,7/15/2017,"This is the first cpk I have been to since moving to Oregon & it was terrible! Got my usual petite wedge with avocado instead of bacon for lunch & was shocked when it came out to be $10, double what I'm used to. Turns out they charged me $3 for avocado without telling me. Also, didn't look up my rewards card or anything. Just handed me the bill & walked off. When I got my salad, I've never felt like I wasted my money more; especially seeing what my $3 avocado got me.

Sepe D.,"Beaverton, OR",9,72,5,3.0,12/21/2016,"Came in for my aunts bday dinner last night ... There was 6 of us and we were told wait time would be 20-25 minutes and we were seated within 15 which was very nice. The server came out immediately took our drink orders and then food orders and our delicious food was brought out very quickly. . . Which would all usually call for a 5 star review!... BUT our server seemed to be in a rush. Not one person was asked if they wanted a refill. Two of us were drinking wine, one a sprite and other coffee, one beer and another Arnold palmer. I was a bit shocked none of us were asked if we wanted another drink? . . . But that wasn't too bad the rude part  was that the bill was brought out while we were STILL eating and we weren't even asked if we wanted dessert?.... which we ordered 2 of the butter cakes with ice cream and again was brought another bill STILL not being asked if anyone wanted another drink?.... she even took the signed check before clearing the table off the numerous empty dishes scattered all over the table. We even stacked them for her as a hint that they needed to be cleared. Other than the server clearly wanting to get out of there the food was great and the dessert spectacular. Next time hopefully we won't feel so rushed and not wanted in your establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard

I am so ashamed of coming here that I will never come back...please save your money and don't eat here you'll be better off at Olive Garden for some pasta and for pizza go to Bellagios.

Bradford D.,"Portland, OR",255,373,172,2.0,9/26/2016,"Interesting visit to CPK this weekend.  It's not my typical pizza joint, and in all honesty, the pizza is good (not fabulous, just good).  I don't eat at chains because you can't have consistency across 100 locations when they each make ""fresh"" food.   Skipping to the interesting part, they do try to offer some local beers at this location.  The menu listed a Commons Brewery beer called Fleur de Ferme.  Hadn't had it before so I ordered it.  Waiter came back, popped the bottle, poured it (poorly at that).  Then I go to do my usual Untappd check in and I'm looking at the bottle and it's the wrong beer.  It's Commons Brewery Urban Farmhouse.  So I told the waiter, he asked the bartender, and the answer I got was they were out of the Fleur de Ferme and the Urban Farmhouse replaced it.  Well WTF.  So if I order a BBQ Chicken pizza and you're out BBQ sauce, are you going to give me a taco pizza?  I was flabergasted.  1) Either the bartender didn't know the menus weren't changed and thought I ordered the Farmhouse, 2) The waiter didn't give a flying F and brought whatever Commons beer the bartender gave him or 3) The bartender didn't care which Commons beer I was given.   Not sure which is worse of the 3.  The waiter asked if the beer was still ok and I said yes, it's a good beer still and I'm not one to let good beer go to waste.  I didn't appreciate that it was still on the bill and I paid $10.50 for a beer I didn't order.  Bad form CPK, bad form.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard
Joan F.,"Portland, OR",118,357,776,3.0,3/6/2015,"Sometimes the family just doesn't share my longing for adventures in food, and I find myself at a restaurant like California Pizza Kitchen.  It's well done meh.  Tonight I tried the fish tacos--grilled not panko-ed.  I liked the cabbage; I like the mahi mahi.  The proportions were off--too much cabbage, which overwhelmed the fish.  There was a spicy 1000 island dressing involved, too, but not in a good way.  The tortillas were chilled, which may have saved prep time, but cold tortillas didn't enhance the meh mahi mahi. The Thai Crunch salad is improved with warmed grilled chicken instead of the chilled chunked chicken (say that fast three times).  No complaints here--their salads are solid.  Add a star if you stick with the salads. The pepperoni pizza is also in their wheel house--my son devoured it after his 2 hour lacrosse practice (go, Aardvarks!).  The three tortilla spring rolls order was a case of poor judgment and more meh.  My husband didn't finish it, but our lacrosse player earned a few assists. The service was fine; the restaurant was busy.  I just don't like it.  Pity we were here, especially when Yelp pointed me to more interesting fare within 10 minutes of CPK.  $80 for four is a lot to pay for mediocre food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard
Katie R.,"Atlanta, GA",44,33,54,4.0,6/19/2014,"It's been years since I have been here, so apparently they have updated the menu and it looks amazing. Ingridients seem to be more fresh, and the service at this particular location was top notch.  I especially loved the large variety of salads and other light choices. Usually a restaurant will have their salad section and I can pick maybe one I actually want. Here? Ummm all of them. In my mouth. Now.  That's even before we get into the pizza options. My friend got the meat lovers and the California Pizza Kitchen version has to be the most legit topping portion sizing I have ever seen for this typical style. Actual long and thin slices of ham that are delicately layered between the pepporni and sausage. Is it possible for a pizza to look pretty? Because, seriously.  It has the Cheesecake Factory effect: A little bit of everything. So it's hard to make a choice, but it's hard to lose.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard?start=40

Great Caesar salad and amazing thin crust Artichoke and Spinach pizza with added chicken. Don't forget to get the Salted Caramel Pudding for dessert.

Parker W.,"Portland, OR",0,15,1,5.0,1/24/2016,"Comparable quality food to schmizza or pizzacato, but California Style, and with a different variety of pizza than your standard American style pizza; more like pizzacato in that respect. Gotta say, I'm not usually this pleased with chain restaurants. I'm a sucker for their margherita pizza, its a steal at $14 and is one seriously good pizza. I'm usually a meat combo type guy, but I crave this pizza, the way the fresh tomatoes and fresh mozzarella come together is just perfect. Had a laugh at the few negative reviews this place has, they're all about the salad?! Lol. What's the matter with people these days? They go to a *Pizza Kitchen* of all places, order a *salad*, then complain when its bland/boring... How special are you really expecting that salad to be?! That's like going to a BBQ joint or a burger place and complaining that the salad is average. Maybe get what the restaurants claim to fame is? SMH.

My partner had their tiramisu, our companions had their butter cake and red velvet cake.  Being able to nibble on each of theirs, I couldn't decide which was better.  All three were decadent, delicious, and delectable!  You can't go wrong with any of them.

CPK is no different than the rest. its a bit of a hard pill to swallow knowing that i can come here and pay $13 for a medium sized pizza - yet the frozen ones at the grocery store goes on sale for 2 for $10. or i can hit nightlife in nearly any major city and get a slice of pizza the size of a small baby for $3. or even go the pizza chain route and get any size any topping for just $10! i suppose - what it all comes down to is whatever tickles your pickle or floats your boat. i'd come here on a few occassions here and there to have something different to keep the taste buds happy but it wouldn't be an every week dining experience for me.  i will however say that the red velvet cake w/ vanilla ice cream is one killer dessert. just not enough to say i'm a fan.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard?start=80

Joseph H.,"Portland, OR",41,186,32,2.0,12/30/2010,"Okay, I'm sorry, but seriously, we need to knock these 5 star reviews down a peg.  First off, the fried spring rolls were better than any of the pizza we ate. The pizza, which as I guessed is NO BETTER than the FROZEN california pizza found in the grocers section. Beware the suburbanite review!  Comments to look for:  ""It's soo clean...""  ""the food is consistent""  ""the service was incredible!""  Let me translate for the uninitiated. When someone mentions clean what they mean is that they only like to eat at franchise establishments that use  the manufacturing process to run their eatery. Think of McDonald's, Olive Garden, Noah's Bagels. All of these are really clean places, but they hurt your soul with the food they serve.  Consistency, see above paragraph. Just because burger king gets your whopper exactly right every time doesn't make it good.  Service. Oh god. The clincher, many suburbanite mammals love it when they get their soda refilled before the glass is empty. They like being bothered during their meal like asking how the food is before you've had the first bite. Then the waiter comes by the table every five minutes to annoy you. Stepford wives are naturally insecure and they are drawn to this type of attention getting, besides it distracts from the meal.  Bland. Boring. Frozen pizza. Get it while it's hot!

It's not like the entire restaurant is full of them, there's a fair amount of weary middle aged shoppers, young families, and annoyed city dwellers filling the tables as well.  But as I found myself here for lunch during an afternoon of shopping at Bridgeport Village I had a hard time fathoming the idea that California Pizza Kitchen is as sacred to young females as the empty purses that they insist on swinging around (and darn near hitting the poor service staff with repeatedly).  But you've got to hand it to CPK, their bright dining room, open kitchen, and extensive menu makes it's fair game for everyone.  With a full page of pizza options flanked by salads, sandwiches, and pasta options it's not difficult to find at least one thing that might take your fancy for lunch or dinner.  The White Pizza, one of the vegetarian options on the menu, was a nice blend of spinach, garlic, and cheeses on a thin crust.  The blend of Mozzarella, Fontina, Ricotta, Parmesan and Pecorino Romano resulted in a slightly sweet flavor that paired well with the veggies, and unlike other pizzas out there, wasn't greasy in the least.   Service is slow, but polite... almost to excess.   I appreciate not having to wait long to get a table or a bit of honesty when things are backed up in the kitchen, but don't really need constant apologies to account for it...  maybe that's just a character flaw on my part.   Still, it's a super friendly atmosphere, and a great place to take break for a bit if you're in the area.  If you consider splitting one of the new small plates and a nice pizza with a friend, you've got yourself a pretty delightful lunch without a major strain on your wallet.  If I find myself out for another random day of shopping I'll definitely be back, because as it stacks up, this is one of the better spots in the Village to grab a meal...

I appreciate the extremely helpful callbacks I received from the staff to confirm my order and make sure we were taken care of.  We may not have been their biggest or best catering order of the season, but they made us feel like it.  It's people like them that make my job fun - we can actually enjoy the party!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard?start=80

I also like that they have a decent wine selection, and that you can get a 3 oz. or 6 oz. glass depending on how you're feeling (at most restaurants your only option is a 5 oz. glass).  Their service is spot-on, attentive but not annoying. So why only three stars?  The main reason would be the price.  Yes, the food is good but there are so many good options in this town that are so much cheaper.  It also tends to be very bright and noisy in the dining room, and I'm not a big fan of either one.  And here's the grumpy old man in me coming out, but does everyone with kids have to take them to the most expensive pizza in town?  The place was crawling with them, and I understand they have a right to be there but I would've expected fewer kids at CPK than, say, Abby's or Chuck E.

Off we shuffled through the snow in shoes not suited to conditions, clothing not suited to conditions and pretty much a surly attitude all the way around at our predicament.  I was thinking that the poor server was going to be eaten alive.  We filed into the revolving door to be met by a welcoming smile of a hostess who seated us immediately in a large both, in the back, near the bathrooms.  Usually a bad sign and one that guarantees your server will overlook you. I was surprised by the menu, it had far more options that just pizza on it, and while it all looked a bit tempting these people are known for pizza and I was determined not to be distracted by that.  I decided on the All White Pizza with many cheeses including fontina and ricotta, garlic and spinach.  The server asked if I wanted crumbled applewood smoked bacon on it.  I responded, ""Then it wouldn't be a white pizza now would it?"" But come on, who can say no to bacon unless you are a devoted vegetarian or 9th level vegan who refuses to eat anything that ever cast a shadow.  So I went with the bacon. Our server was great, he was quick on the refills, never forgot about us and served the pizzas very quickly.  It was impressive to watch him scurry about the place like a squirrel on speed. The pizza was, and I cannot believe I am saying this, really quite good.  The crust was average, I would say if they were to work on the crust it could be amazing, but they don't, so it isn't.  The ricotta makes the pizza along with the garlic.  Bacon was a nice addition, but really unneeded.  So I was surprised by the quality of the toppings. Downside was the price was a little out there for my tastes.  If I could I would give 3.5 stars, and usually I don't like people splitting hairs with half stars but in this case I was really torn on three or four stars.  All in all I had to go down just for the price.

Kellene C.,"Portland, OR",0,9,2,1.0,7/9/2014,"Our recent visit to CPK at Bridgeport was one of my worst dining experiences ever.  For starters when we arrived we were seated in a booth next to a family with a screaming baby when there were many other tables available throughout the restaurant.  We asked to be seated outside instead and were taken to the patio dining area.  we were told the only seating available outside was the couch to which we said fine.  So once we were seated at the couch table the table was still dirty with several kernels of corn and grease smears on the table.  I asked that someone clean the table pointing out the corn.  The rude hostess said ""oh is that all"", we should have just left.  We placed our drink orders, 3 iced tea with lemon.  The tea arrived with 1 or 2 cubes of ice and no sweetener.  When asked to bring sweetener we were told it would be a few minutes???? really???  We placed our order for 3 salads and a pizza.  Food took about 30 minutes which was fine but when it came we had no silverware and again had to ask for it, waited another 10 minutes for that to come, no refills offered on tea so we asked for refills and an extra glass of ice.  Refills and ice were never delivered.  we ate our food and asked for the check.  We will never go back and will not recommend this restaurant.  Terrible service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard?start=100

Michelle H.,"Portland, OR",59,153,,3.0,6/21/2009,"Back when I lived in Hawaii, I used to go here for the pizza because their pizza selection at the time was even more unique than it is now, and it might have been a regional thing, but they had a really wierd-sounding , but good, duck pizza. Now the pizzas served here sound so typical, boooooooring, and definitely not worth the the price.  The salads, however are quite unique and good.  I used to order their good old chopped salad regularly when I lived in Hawaii, and also waaaaaaayyy back when they had a location in NW Portland. This was years ago, but they did have a restaurant in the Nob Hill area for a period of time. .  Since then, I have been turned on to CPK's wonderful Cobb salad (with the optional beets, and sometimes the BBQ version), and it has become my new favorite. The Thai Crunch salad is my husband's favorite, but we also love the Chinese Chicken Salad and Miso Seafood salad. All of the salads we have tried are just bursting with flavor, crunchy toppings, and super fresh ingredients.  An added perk is that you can order on line and have your order ready at a specific time for pickup. Being that I work in the area, I find this service to be really convenient, and I have even used it to pick up dinner to take home.  Hubby and I do not like eating inside the restaurant very much. The hostesses are kind of snobbish and the service is decent, but seemingly pretentious, as is the clientele.  Also, being that we live in NE Portland, it's not like we want to purposely drive all the way back down to Bridgeport Village on the weekend to dine out. We'd rather stay in the Portland area on the weekend.  So...it makes more sense that I use CPK's convenient on line service to pick up a weekday lunch to take back to my office, or take home after work.  I would give CPK four stars for the quality and taste of the food and the on line ordering perk, but due to the somewhat snobbish service and uppity clientele, I think it deserves three stars.  The guys and ladies at the to-go window are quite friendly, however.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard?start=100
Rebecca W.,"San Diego, CA",20,249,42,3.0,4/3/2011,"It was about 10 years since the last time I ate at the California Pizza Kitchen. I just remember loving the pizza I had ordered all those years ago and had been meaning to return for some time. The atmosphere was very casual inside. The noise level was not too bad. The menu was large and had lots to choose from. My husband cracked me up when he suggested we share a pizza. I guess he figured a $12.00 pizza would be big enough for two. I would normally agree, but knew from my last visit that each pizza was a personal size pizza....for one. Yes, $12.00 for a small pizza barely enough to fill the belly of a hungry adult. Yikes! This got me thinking. Why is it that we always get suckered into eating at this places where they charge outrageous prices for food we know we could get elsewhere much cheaper...or better yet, make ourselves. But, we go anyway, and pay nearly $60.00 for enough pizza and non-alcoholic drinks to feed two adults and 2 children. I think we get caught up in the moment. It seems like the perfect way to fill in our day, being waited on, chatting with friends and family, not having to clean up afterwards...then the bill comes and you wonder ""Was it really worth it?"" Well, the answer to that question usually directly relates to how much money I have in the bank account. Alas, the experience was great. We had to kindest waitress take our orders. She was thorough, attentive, and patient.  When my pizza came out I saw there were onions on it, which I hate. I muttered a sigh of disappointment and scolded myself for not having read the menu better. The waitress heard my disappointment and insisted on having a new pizza cooked up for me. I refused at first, feeling quite bad, knowing it was my own fault. But she wasn't willing to give in that easily. She insisted on bringing me a pizza that was to my liking and told me she'd have it out in about 6 minutes. True to her word, she returned about 6 minutes later with a brand new pizza just the way I wanted it. She did this all with a smile and positive attitude. So maybe we were getting our money's worth...maybe.  The pizza was good, but if I am going to spend this much on pizza I would much rather go to Hot Lips Pizza in downtown Portland. I really can't seem to justify the cost for the product; I mean, it's PIZZA; dough, cheese, a few toppings...really nothing expensive. So why are we paying so much for it? It seems a bit crazy.  Certainly couldn't complain about anything other than the price. Great staff, great food, and a comfy atmosphere. I think we'll go back....but next time we are ordering just water for drinks. Got to cut back on that bill!! I give this place 5 stars for their staff, 4 for their food, and 1 for their prices....I think I'll round that out to an overall average of 3stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard?start=100

John I.,"Manassas, VA",6,36,,2.0,7/3/2008,"I'm giving this place 2 stars in order to be objective.  CPK has been around a long time, and having eaten there in L.A. in the good old days I can't say they've gotten better. Sadly the food got worse, and more expensive.   It's a trendy concept place like a Planet Hollywood, and as for pizza we have much better choices here in Portland. If you want a fun and upscale place, you can go to the Cheesecake Factory in Beaverton to get Thai Chicken Pasta and a fruity drink if that's your taste that day. I ate at this CPK three times in the last year, and each time it failed to bring the goods.  I think that's why there is only one is the whole state, because it's just not that good like in the early 90's.

I don't know where I left my appetite, but I didn't have a big one.  I nearly opted to just get a bowl of soup, but since it's been AGES since I had my Tostada Pizza, I just had to order it...right? If you don't know what a Tostada Pizza is, let me fill you in.  It's pizza dough (thus being a pizza!) with refried beans, cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, some green bits (cilantro?), tortilla strips, and a garlic-ranch type of sauce on top.  It's warm on the bottom and cold on top.  You definitely start to eat your slice with a fork and then usually end up eating the crust with your hands.   The restaurant is located on the far end of BridgePort village (near Macaroni Grill and McCormick & Schmick's) where parking can be difficult.  I hate the revolving door, but that's another story.  The restaurant is spacious and each server's tag indicates their name and the state where they're from.  Today, we had David from New Jersey.  He forgot the bread and butter before our pizzas, but he made sure we always had something to drink.  Oh well.   Are there other pizza joints with better pizza?  Yeh....but do they have a Tostada Pizza??  NO.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard?start=100

This pizza was also pretty small for two people and I had to make a salad to go with it once I got it home. They do have an almost overwhelming variety of pizza to choose from I just don't think I made the optimal choice.

The resturant is clean and attractive, and our waiter was nice, though not particularly attentive-he seemed distracted most of the time.  Always ready to try new things, we ordered the Sesame Chicken Ginger Dumplings as our appetizer. Big Mistake. We were expecting something along the lines of the fabulous crab and shrimp wontons found at McGrath's or PF Changs, but no such luck. These are more like potstickers, and since they weren't especially hot, the texture was like eating room temp raw fish, thus inspiring a gag reflex. My husband almost lost it at the table. Maybe some people like this kind of thing, so good for them-but we'll definitely stick with something sure-fire like hummus next time. The bread that came with the meal was just ho-hum not-very-fresh sourdough-the real touch of Italy...er, California I guess.    We ordered the Goat Cheese with Roasted Pepper Pizza with smoked applewood bacon as our entree.

The food is good, even very good in some cases.  Service is good and fairly fast. Usually by cute people in their twenties or so.  The food is  of course centered on pizza.  Made on a tasty bready thin Pizza which is quite tasty and always cooked perfect for me. Also on the menu are soup, salads, entrees, my parents love the cedar plank salmon.   They also have deserts some are seasonal like the strawberry shortcake. Prices are OK and the decor is bright and modern.  In nice weather you can sit outside, they even have those directional heaters out there.  The place feels like it should be a four star.  I think the real reason I give it three instead is that it feels institutional,  while they smile and say the right things, the servers seem in a hurry.  I don't think this is the servers fault as it has been the same since they opened and at other branches I have been to,  I think it is that servers have to big an area to serve.  I have also noticed servers don't seem to last long,  I am here every couple of months and the staff always seems new.  Also everything is just so like you could be anywhere,  no real personality to the restaurant.  In all I think at the prices they charge they should be doing better at these things.  Don't get me wrong I really like the BBQ chicken pizza and I will be back but  the place is at the bottom end of my list of favorites. .

Alyssa S.,"Portland, OR",2,3,,5.0,1/28/2017,"Courtney was our server for lunch, and she gave us the best service ever! She checked on us frequently and gave us wonderful recommendations! I will definitely come back here. The carne Asada pizza was perfect for two people and we ate the wraps as our appetizer! Delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard?start=20
Kristine Y.,"Salem, OR",45,194,142,4.0,9/2/2014,"Came in for lunch today.  Very bright and lively interior, liked the pizza oven with the yellow tiles.  We shared a pizza, 1/2 white pizza with bacon added and 1/2 California whatever-its-called.   He was fond of the white pizza with the ricotta cheese and simplicity of ingredients.  I enjoyed the Cali blend pizza with the salad ""on top"" and avocado slices.  It was a bit of different take on pizza - but the crust was pretty good, the chicken pieces were nice white meat and seasoned well.   Overall, good dining experience.  It was nice to have been offered bread and olive oil prior to our pizza.  Attentive server who brought things right out.  He didn't like the complimentary bread - to hard and crunchy/chewy.  I found it ok. A fairly quick lunch with many options.  I wouldn't order those pizza options again - but good for a one timer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard?start=20
Jeanette B.,"Cottage Grove, OR",11,22,1,5.0,7/13/2016,"What an. Awesome lunch today. We had never been to this restaurant or the chain before so mentioned that to our waitperson when asking a few questions before ordering. We ended up with a Thai chicken salad, an asparagus arugula salad and a flatbread. It was delicious. Imagine our surprise when we were finished and the chef came out with a salted caramel pudding for us, on the house, as a great for our first visit. The waitperson had conveyed the information and we were so surprised. There went the diet! We will definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard?start=20

Carl P.,"Chico, CA",1,7,,5.0,1/15/2017,Great food and great pours when ordering wine and mixed drinks. Sean at the bar makes you feel welcome and important. So ask for him! Truth is they are all really nice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard?start=20
Anthony M.,"West Linn, OR",0,6,3,3.0,12/12/2015,"I tend to always write longer reivews, so in short, I will be leaving a quick paragraph for anyone looking to eat here. The bulk of my reviews are to help the managment team see their flaws and progress towards a better experience for us guests. The food was pretty good. We ordered the Spicy Chipotle pizza on thin crust, a few of the small dishes and the BBQ chicken salad for our entrées. We got the Tiramisu for dessert. I didn't enjoy the small dishes but my girlfriend and her aunt found them to be OK. The pizza we ordered was nice and I would get it again. The dessert was not that great because of the overpowering cream they lathered ontop. The waitress, who never introduced herself to my girlfriend and me, was not very inviting and didnt make the experience as great as it could've been. I will come back for pizza, but I am disappointed in the way the my waitress addressed us today.  Continuing into my longer reivew, my girlfriend and I came here to meet up with her aunt for a quick lunch date. We showed up after her aunt had already gotten seats, so we promptly walked over to where she was sitting after not being welcomed at the door. We sat down and already had waters, menus, etc. The waitress who came up to us didn't bother to learn our names or even tell us hers. She asked us if we wanted any other drinks and walked off.  When we were ready to order, the waitresses was timely on checking up on us. We got our orders in, and she left. After that, she tended to not check up on us as often as before. I actually ran out of water without recieving a fill up even after dessert came.  The food came in pretty quick, and I enjoyed the pizza. The small dishes had a lack of flavor, and I personally was expecting more. The salad was of good quality, and my girlfriend enjoyed it. Overall, we had pretty good food with a few accepting. Also, the plating was nice and clean.  My biggest concern was the customer service. Our waitress did not sell me on the experience at this California Pizza Kitchen. If I want, I can order my food to go and eat in the comfort of my own home, but going out to resturants is about the experience that you gain while eating. The food is only a small fraction of that experience. If I do not feel welcome, how can I thoroughly enjoy my food? As I stated before, the point of eating out is the customer experience, and I had a very unwelcoming and bland experience. If the team leader reads these reviews, I ask that you help your team with expanding the conversation and maybe learning the names of your guests. The key is to make us feel welcome and sell the experience along with the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard?start=20
Steele C.,"Portland, OR",0,29,7,4.0,5/30/2015,"I always enjoy CPK.  I like the fact you can pick up food to go easily or eat in the restaurant with out waiting too long.  The mix of food is good.  Some of the type of dishes they have come in many forms.  They make take the Thai flavor for example and put it pasta, pizza, and salad forms.  I do enjoy the food. Another thing about this place...I am lactose intolerant but the fact that they do not over cheese their pizzas really allows me to enjoy the food without being sick later...Thank you CPK. This last time I was there the server with the name Kyle was awesome.  He was very genuine, kind and friendly.  Something you really do not see that often.  Next time I will ask to be in his section. I would go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard?start=20
Janet P.,"West Linn, OR",0,7,,2.0,12/4/2016,"What a disappointment. Our food was meh, but the service was so bad, it didn't matter how the food tasted. Our server was awkward, dismissive, and downright rude. There were a number of managers wandering about. The one time I wish they had asked how things were, they didn't! We were looking forward to sharing the pumpkin cheesecake and definitely would have ordered a second round of drinks. Our server never bothered to ask...just dropped the check and ignored us. There are lots of choices at Bridgeport, so it will be awhile before we visit CPK again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard?start=20
