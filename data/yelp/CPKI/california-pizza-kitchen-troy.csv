Jennifer G.,"Birmingham, MI",35,49,9,4.0,12/7/2017,"I have never had a bad meal here. The drinks are good, the desserts are amazing, and the food is reliably flavorful.  The service is decent--sometimes you have a very attentive server and sometimes you wait a long time for things, but they seem to have improved over the last few times we've gone.  The only downside is that there is a 30+ minute wait if you arrive after 6 p.m. on a weekend.  And it's inside a mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy
Jay R.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",13,202,271,1.0,12/15/2017,"Dirty table, dirty silverware, orders came out wrong or burnt. The manager who was dressed like a coach of a peewee hockey team was a total fool. Our server was rude and disrespectful. We left our food mid meal and walked out, promising never to return.  One thing I can understand is it's the holiday time, they are located in the mall, every employee looks like they wanna have a nervous breakdown, but that attitude quickly trickles down to the customer which in return makes the customer wanna have a nervous breakdown. Get your act together. That's all I can say.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy
Elina D.,"Walled Lake, MI",39,182,379,1.0,12/11/2017,"CPK has gone down hill, especially this location! We were seated at a table that wasn't cleaned off. So we sat at the booth waiting for it to be cleaned. The waitress came to greet us and we asked if the table could be wiped off, she quickly apologized. While waiting for our table to get cleaned, we opened up our napkin rolls and every piece of silverware was dirty. We asked for new sets, and she said really, let me look at these. She literally started inspecting the silverware, and didn't take our word for it. What's the point of arguing?  The waitress came back (five minutes later) and said ok here you go. In the meantime, our table was not wiped off, which she quickly did after we reminded her. The manager stopped by our table and apologized for the way things started off. He offered us a complimentary app, which was a very nice gesture. He said for us to check back in with him after our meal, to make sure everything else turned out well.  We ordered the complimentary trio appetizer of spring rolls, and a few of the rolls were burned (see photo). We didn't bother complaining and just dealt with it.  We ordered the Thai crunch salad and the Jamaican jerk pizza. The salad was swimming in dressing and pizza didn't come out as requested.  We ordered the bacon very well done, and the majority of the bacon on the pizza was very undercooked.  We asked for a manager and shared our complaints with him. He apologized, but he was pretty dismissive and ran off quickly. I understand, it's the holidays and the mall is busy, but at least act like you give a damn. I was just surprised that a manager would be wearing a football jersey and a baseball hat during hours of business. Safe to say, this place isn't used to be like it was back in the day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy
David M.,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",140,542,3079,4.0,11/11/2017,"We came here on Veterans Day for their Veterans Specials for dinner with friends; two of us are Veterans so we were ready to choose selections from their Specials Menu.  Because it is located within Somerset Mall the parking was particularly challenging; we had to circle three floors several times before we found someone leaving. Our friends were already there and had just gotten a table so we walked in and just joined them.  After we ordered drinks (Diet Coke with Lemon for me and my wife wanted to try Cucumber Revival) we studied the menus and I chose a Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage Pizza from the Veterans Day Menu and my wife picked a Half Order Roasted Vegetables Salad. Is was quite busy because it was Saturday night as well as Veterans Day but service was quick and and our orders came out very promptly.  Drinks were kept full although we did have to ask for refills a couple times.  The Pizza was very good and the crust had good chew as well as decent crunch and I knew I had made a good choice.  My wife's Grilled Vegetable Salad was grilled and then chilled vegetables served on top of chopped lettuce and my wife loved it! Of course we had no room left for dessert so, maybe next time.  For our first time eating at any CPK, we we enjoyed the dishes and would definitely come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy
Billy L.,"Romeo, MI",20,217,533,4.0,12/8/2017,I always have a great experience at the California pizza kitchen and this was no different. It was during a Christmas shopping trip and this is located at the Somerset Mall on the Macy's side of the street which is the north side of the street. I got the roasted veggie salad (just the half) and my friend got the barbecue chicken pizza duo with the Caesar salad. We both enjoyed our food and I will definitely make sure I go back again. It was very crowded so service was just so so but I understand the waitress was doing the best she could,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy
Lindsey P.,"Rochester Hills, MI",185,74,100,5.0,9/10/2017,"I've never had a bad time at this place. They have amazing mojitos in many flavors. My friend got a Jamaican jerk pizza it was really good, seasoning was perfect! I ordered the Asian salad, it had a lot of dressing and I could have gone without the rice noodles but it was a very good salad for the most part, if you're at the mall or in the area check out this place for a pizza, cocktails or a nice lunch combo with would, salad or sandwhich!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy
Ryan M.,"Troy, MI",0,8,1,3.0,1/5/2018,"This is probably my favorite restaurant in town. If you're going to splurge, this is the place to do it. The service is prompt but gruff, though I'd argue that's part of the rustic pizza house feel. Or waiter, Tom, was helpful for pairing beers with pizza. Everything you've heard is 100% true and then some! Obviously the steak is the main event, and every time I go it's top notch-- juice and perfectly cooked. Don't skip dessert! The house made cheescake is out-of-this-world good, so save room on your main course. If you've read this far that means you didn't realize that I typed Yelp's example review while I waited for my dinner to arrive. What I'm really upset about is that I could have done if during the 40 minute wait time. Although I haven't had the food at this location yet, I have been to this restaurant and the food is quite yummy. As the name suggests, try the pizza. Dessert is good. They do take reservations so if they're being nice that day, call ahead and put your name on the list.  Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy
Nicole W.,"Troy, MI",37,120,442,1.0,12/30/2016,We sat at the bar because it was packed and a 20+ minute wait. Everything was good until a manager went to places glasses on the counter and her arm pit touched my drink and straw while she was reaching to move glasses forward... WTF gross!! The best was she never apologized she walked away. Food was fast and delicious and the bartender was pleasant. I can't give more than 1 star bc of the Manager's arm pit!!! Disappointing and disgusting I'm tempted to call the Health Department now after watching the pizza guy touch toppings without gloves and toss back onto the pizza,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy
Madelyne W.,"Auburn Hills, MI",72,64,32,3.0,11/25/2016,"I went here on Black Friday and it's in Somerset so I definitely kept that in mind while writing this review. The wait was long but we expected that. I really like that they don't give you a buzzer, they just text you when your table is ready so you don't have to walk around the mall to kill the time with a buzzer. I've been here a couple times and my favorite thing to get is the California Club pizza with goat cheese and whole grain crust. If I ever decide to venture out of that favorite, the menu has ample options (not just pizza) and a lot of health conscious substitutions easily available, which I really appreciate. The restaurant was decently clean and I think it has a good ambiance. The only things I don't like is that people walking by will literally stare you down if you're eating next to the window but I mean the restaurant is in a mall so what are you gonna do. The second is that all the times I've been here the bathroom doors are literally revolting. They're a misted glass and every time all you can see is tons and tons of greasy handprints.  Our waiter took awhile to greet us and he never gave us the free bread we're supposed to get or the lemons we asked for our waters. However we did have modifications on our dishes and everything came out like we asked. Like I said, it was Black Friday. I'm sure he was doing the best he could. All in all I like this place and it's a go to when I'm at Somerset because it's not ridiculously expensive like every other place there. I'd give it four stars except my boyfriend's gotten food poisoning from there twice. I have not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy
Gwendolyn M.,"Knoxville, TN",111,138,237,5.0,8/17/2016,CPK is so much more than pizza. They have a nice menu with a wide assortment of food including fresh specialty salads. It had been a while since I visited but I was not disappointed when I last visited.The service was great and even though it was lunchtime I did not have to look around for my server. The food was fresh and full of flavor. It is a little pricey if you only look at the cost but it is very reasonable when you look at the quality of food that you receive. It is located away from the food court in Somerset Mall so you can enjoy a relaxing dining atmosphere. At peak times there can be a wait as they are a very popular place.  I will be back to visit again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy
Lindsay M.,"Detroit, MI",14,37,1489,4.0,7/16/2017,I haven't been to CPK in years. My sister and I tried it for lunch. At first glance of the menu I thought the prices were expensive. I missed the lunch specials on the back of the menu where the prices were a little more reasonable. I ordered the pizza and salad combo and it was about $11- excellent! My sister ordered the spinach dip appetizer which was tasty. I love that they give you bread too. I'll be back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy
Adrian D.,"Rochester, MI",21,97,144,4.0,6/27/2017,"The wait wasn't long for a Saturday night. But the check in process was awkward. The hostess didn't have a microphone, they weren't giving out beepers and this caused a lot of confusion since you could barely hear the hostesses voice over the loud mall noise.  It was definitely worth the confusion as everything we order was delicious.  One thing I enjoy about CPK is that they are consistent. The BBQ chicken pizza is my favorite. You also can't go wrong with their salads.  Make sure to save room for dessert since they always have a great selection.  If you don't mind sitting at the bar it's a good way to sit down without the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy

The place was packed because it was lunch time but we still managed to get great service. I ordered soup and salad (I was on a diet, LOL) and my friends ordered their pies. Everything was delicious.  My only downside was the portion sizes. My plate was as wide as a sun hat but had a weird concave bowl part for soup in the middle. *insert confused girl meme here*.

Aaron M.,"Troy, MI",5,4,,1.0,2/4/2017,Very disappointing SMALL PORTIONS server here .  I left this Resturant so hungry after I already ate my meal most places I'm always bring some of my meal to take home not here though.  I could have eaten 2 or 3 times what I was served here. I ordered cedar plank salmon the asparagus was cold and most of all the PORTIONS  ARE SMALL best to come here if you want to blow $50.00 on you and a date for a snack sized dinner meal they should Advertise that their menu is a kiddie menu because that's what you get an appetizer sized meal. Next time I'll go to Pieology  and be Full for under $9.00  I should have spend $50.00 on Pieology then I would have went home with 1 pizza in my belly 1 Pizza for my date and 6 Pizzas to take home with us!

Stephen M.,"Grosse Pointe, MI",0,4,,1.0,1/3/2017,"I hate when people only provide a review on Yelp when things are bad, so let me say this:  I ate at this same CPK in August and we had a fantastic meal.  Great service, excellent food, and a great atmosphere.  My daughter loved it so much that she was anxious to come back, and we relented even though we really didn't want CPK today.   Unfortunately, she wasn't given the opportunity to eat there today because the service was so bad.  After waiting nearly 10 minutes to be seated (even though we were the second group in line and there were many empty tables), we waited at our table for almost 20 minutes.  No one came by.  No one asked about drinks.  And there didn't even appear to be much activity near us in terms of wait staff.  The employees we did see (most of them anyway) weren't hustling, and it was obvious that no one cared about the customer experience today.  We were hesitant to sit after the entry wait, concerned that it would be the same level of service once we sat down. Unfortunately, we were right.  With no one even meandering through our section, we finally gave up and decided to leave rather than start the dining experience nearly 30 minutes after entering the restaurant. There were a number of empty tables.  It wasn't a slow day, to be sure, but it wasn't a mall Saturday, either.  I suspect they just didn't have the staffing to handle the tables, but the answer to that is not to sit people and let them know up front where things stand. Just abysmal service.  My daughter was so sad because she loves the place.  Fortunately, we were able to find a nearby establishment interested in our business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy

Stephanie T.,"Richmond, Canada",85,152,2794,4.0,5/10/2014,"This was my first visit to California Pizza Kitchen and I had an okay time. At 2pm, we thought we would be able to get a table quickly. This was not the case. Oh well, we waited about 15 min which allowed us time to install the CPK app for a free ""small plate"". I felt like the service was a little slow here. Our waiter, Travis, was very friendly and patient. After we ordered, we expected to get the complimentary bread soon after. I was starving so I really wanted to eat something quick. However, after waiting for about 15 min, we decided to ask for it. After we did, it came shortly. For our free small plate, we got a shaved mushroom and spinach flatbread. This was the perfect size - four pieces for the four of us. It was quite tasty as well and super cute! We ordered the California club pizza, which is first baked with bacon, chicken, and cheese, and then topped with a salad, basil, and avocado. I found that the basil was too much as they were literally placed almost whole on top. I like basil, though, so it was ok for me, but I can imagine others not feeling the same. I really liked this pizza! We also got a White pizza and added bacon for $1.59. This was also quite good, very cheesy. I found that these pizza crusts got chewy and hard and difficult to eat after it got cold. We also got the fish taco. It only came with 2 tacos, some salsa, and chips. The fish was mahi-mahi and was quite good, obviously good quality fish. The portion was quite small for the price. I love coleslaw though, so this was pretty good for us to share. Overall, food was good and service was good. For a chain restaurant, I would say it met my expectations. I would definitely go again when I'm in the states and they had it somewhere nearby! Cheesecake Factory would be my choice before this place, though. Yay!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy?start=20

Harris N.,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",4,156,61,3.0,3/3/2014,"It's a very busy CPK. There's a long 20-25 min wait that you have to put your name in for. It's like that most weekends.  The good thing is that it's in a mall and you can occupy yourself with other things. They started a new system that texts and calls you when the table is ready so it makes it much nicer. It's an updated store since it's a pilot location. For food I normally get the jambalaya or the Kung pao spaghetti. Both are good not great. A bit too much overpowering flavor on both. The pizzas are good but I do t find them filling enough for me. Prices feel a bit high for the value you get, but maybe they are going for a more upscale price point. My major annoyance with CPK is the bread. First you have to ask to get it served. Then they give about one slice of a baguette per person. I want bread, not bread crumbs! Aside from that though, the restaurant is always busy for good reason.

Melissa B.,"Wake Forest, NC",92,131,206,3.0,5/20/2014,"Not the best visit we've ever had. I have been to this location many any times. Usually the service is great. Our servers in the past have been quite attentive, checks in to see if we need anything during the meal, after the meal. Grabs dishes that have piled up. Refills on drinks.  You know the drill. On Sunday we had Mary. Now while she was friendly and helpful in taking our orders there seemed to be a lacking component of follow up. The kids meals came first. My mom ordered a salad and I had soup. It took a full 20+ minutes before our items came to the table. By then the kids were done eating their pasta. She noticed their drinks were empty at that point but made no special trip in between to see if we needed anything or to even let us know about the delay in our meals. Once we were done we sat there. We watched people come and go. We watched people being served. But Mary was everywhere else. Anywhere else. We finally had to flag her down to order dessert and get our check. I still had to ask her to remove some of the excess plates on the table. This is not typical by any means. We have eaten here many many times as I've said before and never experienced slow service or a server who has forgotten us. Yes we've been here during madhouse busy hours as well as low peak hours.

Ramya R.,"Rochester, MI",0,1,,1.0,5/7/2017,"So I have waited for two weeks to write this review to give them a fair chance. I had ordered a takeout where I specifically told them (multiple times) to leave the chicken out when making the salad (which btw costs 15 bucks for god knows what). Looks like the chef forgot and put it in anyway and at the last moment removed it. When I opened it, there were little pieces of chicken in it. This has happened to me in other places and I understand that not many people ask to leave the meat out. When I called the manager, he refused to cancel the order (the other places have offered to do that) and would only allow me to pick up another one. On top of that he definitely was talking down to me like I was lying or something. I did not have the time to go back and he said he will drop in a gift card instead and took down my address. Two weeks later, I am still waiting for my gift card and paid $15 for food I could not eat.

While the interior is certainly much nicer, gone are the ugly 80's lemon yellow paint and in is the new sleek rustic wood nightclub look.   However the pizza is garbage. I will preface it by saying after a trip to naples a couple years ago my pizza palette was refined. There are two categories; good and basically frozen s$@!.

Anthony D.,"Royal Oak, MI",118,73,4,2.0,12/6/2012,"I only went here to take advantage of an American Express cash back offer.  I think it was something like spend $25 and get $10 back.  I wasn't too impressed overall and I don't think I would be back unless someone else was paying for it. The food itself is very mediocre.  I know I shouldn't expect much from a national chain like this, but I still ended up being disappointed.  The pizzas are small and expensive.  It was average at best.   The service was slow and crappy, and I really don't feel it was our server's fault.  It is clear to me that CPK values table turnover above anything else.  The moment any party would get up to leave, the bussers would swarm the table like locusts and get it prepared for the next group who was seated immediately.  This process seriously took less than 30 seconds.  This would be all fine and dandy if the servers and floor manager actually paid attention to the people who were already seated.  Unfortunately once you're seated, they no longer care. It took a while to get greeted by our server due to his section being hopelessly over-sat.  He didn't have time to wipe his ass, let alone pay enough attention to us. My girlfriend ordered a wine sampler, and the wine glasses were dirty.  One of them had a big gross lipstick print on the rim.  It didn't even look like the glass was washed. When we unrolled our silverware it looked pretty rough too.  We tried to flag down our server, but he was visibly overwhelmed and speedwalking from table to table.  We saw a manager talking to a group of bussers, presumably cracking the whip to increase table turnover.  When she walked by our table, we tried to flag her down as well.  She just kept walking and we never saw her again.  Eventually our server came back to check on us, and we informed him of our filthy glassware/silverware.  He apologized and quickly replaced it for us. In the end the server was able to get a manager to remove one of our appetizers from our total.  While that is a nice gesture, it's not enough to convince me to come back.  It's obvious to me where CPK's priorities lie, and it's not on customer service or food quality.

CPK as a chain is not bad and I'd give them 4 stars.  The portions are very small but they offer interesting toppings on the pizzas particularly (such as pear or artichoke).  Plus I love how I recently noticed on the menu that they have posted detailed information for vegetarians and vegans ( ), allergen information ( ), gluten free options ( ), and nutritional information ( ).   This is EXCELLENT and SO HELPFUL.  I think more restaurants should do this. It does state that there may be some variance between locations so I always still ask.  At this location, the waitress seemed to have no clue about what could be vegetarian.  Honestly, she seemed uninterested in helping.  I stuck to a salad which was sad.  I don't know if the information on the website was available then but I could have used it.  She should definitely have known more.  For comparison purposes at the Farmington Hills location at least they tried to help.  Not only should she have known more, her service was so slow.  She only checked for refills of water once and asked how our food was once.  We were there for one-and-a-half hours most of which was waiting! I know this location is busy but service was slow at the other location mentioned too (Farmington Hills).  I really hope that improves.  Still, I'm very happy that this is one chain that has gone out of its way to work with vegans and vegetarians.  Hopefully the cheeses listed are free of rennet and hopefully a vegan cheese option makes its way onto the menu too.  Thank you (as a chain) for at least for providing such detailed information.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy?start=40
Emma S.,"Oakland charter Township, MI",0,18,4,1.0,8/7/2015,"I have been to this particular restaurant dozens of times. I would've given my service a 3 or 4 star rating, but today when I visited I felt almost annoyed about my experience. My mother and I walked in and was able to pick our spots by the bar. The second we sat our purses on the counter and was barely on our seats, the waiter asked what drinks we wanted. He quickly grabbed the drinks and about 1 minute into our visit he asked us what we would like. I politely asked for more time to look through the menu. Mind you, the restaurant wasn't particularly busy yet this bartender/waiter was being a bit pushy. After ordering, as my mom and I were sitting there enjoying each other's company, I hear our waiter obnoxiously holler to a cook that I had a nut allergy, which I had told him when I ordered my food. I am almost sure that everyone in the restaurant heard him. He apologized but I was still a bit ticked. Time passed, and our waiter and a few of his coworkers were joking about how another coworker has the tendency to never pay for his food. They started harassing that employee in a funny matter. I thought it was funny at first but the employees got so loud it was very distracting! Almost immature. Eventually the food came out, and as my mom was in the bathroom when her plate arrived, the waiter asked me to press my finger on the pizza she ordered to make sure it wasn't cold. Like, wtf? California Pizza Kitchen more like Pizza probably shipped from California  and put into a freezer for months. Now that really irritated me, but as a frequent customer I was even more appalled when the waiter came out with a cup of my tortilla soup, which is usually boiling hot and filled to the rim. This time, I was given a Lukewarm 1/4 filled cup of soup, took me about 30 seconds to eat.

Esther G.,"Brooklyn, NY",135,383,29,2.0,1/23/2013,"I would never come here unless I was already at Somerset and even then, it's for the convenience factor of not having to trek to the South end.  Getting seated immediately happens almost never. The wait is always 15 minutes for more. You would think by now they'd figure out a buzzer system so people can pop in to nearby shops, but nope. Your entire party must be there when your name is called, which is hard enough to hear anyway if you're waiting because it's so loud. As for the food, it always sounds better than it actually is. I've had other pizzas before but I can't recall what. Our meat cravers is a crispy thin crust. Good luck eating a slice without having all the ingredients fall because the crust isn't thick enough to hold the Italian sausage, bacon (both very skimy), pepperoni, ham and salami. The ingredients were small bits of meat, but the sausage was not. Seriously, they all kept rolling off! It also could use a more sauce. The field greens salad in a dijon balsamic vinaigrette was the best part. An abundance of fresh greens, with pears and walnuts that provided a balance of savory, sweet and juicy.

Turd F.,"Center Line, MI",59,73,,2.0,7/9/2012,Ho hum are the two words to describe this restaurant and their food. I ordered the Korean BBQ taco appetizer and it was terrible. The tiny pieces of steak were tougher than shoe leather (as was the flour tortilla they served it in.) The sauce had some heat to it which was nice but the flavor was so overwhelmingly soy sauce that it just tasted bitter. My husband liked the lettuce wrap appetizer he ordered. He was kind of irked that it came unassembled.  I ordered the Tostada pizza with lime chicken per Yelpers recommendation. The crust was more like a fried chalupa rather than pizza crust and I didn't like it. The chicken was so puny that I dug through the mess on top just to make sure it was in there. The toppings were okay but again I wish it had pizza crust.  My husband had the pear gorgonzola thin crust pizza and said it was just okay. He said the pesto chicken pizza is much better. We ate here on a Saturday night around 8 pm and the place was packed. We were told the wait was 20-25 minutes but actually waited 40 minutes.

Elina D.,"Walled Lake, United States",39,182,379,1.0,11/12/2017,"CPK has gone down hill, especially this location! We were seated at a table that wasn't cleaned off. So we sat at the booth waiting for it to be cleaned. The waitress came to greet us and we asked if the table could be wiped off, she quickly apologized. While waiting for our table to get cleaned, we opened up our napkin rolls and every piece of silverware was dirty. We asked for new sets, and she said really, let me look at these. She literally started inspecting the silverware, and didn't take our word for it. What's the point of arguing?  The waitress came back (five minutes later) and said ok here you go. In the meantime, our table was not wiped off, which she quickly did after we reminded her. The manager stopped by our table and apologized for the way things started off. He offered us a complimentary app, which was a very nice gesture. He said for us to check back in with him after our meal, to make sure everything else turned out well.  We ordered the complimentary trio appetizer of spring rolls, and a few of the rolls were burned (see photo). We didn't bother complaining and just dealt with it.  We ordered the Thai crunch salad and the Jamaican jerk pizza. The salad was swimming in dressing and pizza didn't come out as requested.  We ordered the bacon very well done, and the majority of the bacon on the pizza was very undercooked.  We asked for a manager and shared our complaints with him. He apologized, but he was pretty dismissive and ran off quickly. I understand, it's the holidays and the mall is busy, but at least act like you give a damn. I was just surprised that a manager would be wearing a football jersey and a baseball hat during hours of business.

Our friends were already there and had just gotten a table so we walked in and just joined them.  After we ordered drinks (Diet Coke with Lemon for me and my wife wanted to try Cucumber Revival) we studied the menus and I chose a Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage Pizza from the Veterans Day Menu and my wife picked a Half Order Roasted Vegetables Salad. Is was quite busy because it was Saturday night as well as Veterans Day but service was quick and and our orders came out very promptly.  Drinks were kept full although we did have to ask for refills a couple times.  The Pizza was very good and the crust had good chew as well as decent crunch and I knew I had made a good choice.  My wife's Grilled Vegetable Salad was grilled and then chilled vegetables served on top of chopped lettuce and my wife loved it!

The service is prompt but gruff, though I'd argue that's part of the rustic pizza house feel. Or waiter, Tom, was helpful for pairing beers with pizza. Everything you've heard is 100% true and then some! Obviously the steak is the main event, and every time I go it's top notch-- juice and perfectly cooked. Don't skip dessert! The house made cheescake is out-of-this-world good, so save room on your main course. If you've read this far that means you didn't realize that I typed Yelp's example review while I waited for my dinner to arrive. What I'm really upset about is that I could have done if during the 40 minute wait time. Although I haven't had the food at this location yet, I have been to this restaurant and the food is quite yummy. As the name suggests, try the pizza. Dessert is good.

Madelyne W.,"Auburn Hills, United States",72,64,32,3.0,25/11/2016,"I went here on Black Friday and it's in Somerset so I definitely kept that in mind while writing this review. The wait was long but we expected that. I really like that they don't give you a buzzer, they just text you when your table is ready so you don't have to walk around the mall to kill the time with a buzzer. I've been here a couple times and my favorite thing to get is the California Club pizza with goat cheese and whole grain crust. If I ever decide to venture out of that favorite, the menu has ample options (not just pizza) and a lot of health conscious substitutions easily available, which I really appreciate. The restaurant was decently clean and I think it has a good ambiance. The only things I don't like is that people walking by will literally stare you down if you're eating next to the window but I mean the restaurant is in a mall so what are you gonna do. The second is that all the times I've been here the bathroom doors are literally revolting. They're a misted glass and every time all you can see is tons and tons of greasy handprints.  Our waiter took awhile to greet us and he never gave us the free bread we're supposed to get or the lemons we asked for our waters. However we did have modifications on our dishes and everything came out like we asked. Like I said, it was Black Friday. I'm sure he was doing the best he could. All in all I like this place and it's a go to when I'm at Somerset because it's not ridiculously expensive like every other place there.

The food was fresh and full of flavor. It is a little pricey if you only look at the cost but it is very reasonable when you look at the quality of food that you receive. It is located away from the food court in Somerset Mall so you can enjoy a relaxing dining atmosphere. At peak times there can be a wait as they are a very popular place.

Stephen M.,"Grosse Pointe, United States",0,4,,1.0,3/1/2017,"I hate when people only provide a review on Yelp when things are bad, so let me say this:  I ate at this same CPK in August and we had a fantastic meal.  Great service, excellent food, and a great atmosphere.  My daughter loved it so much that she was anxious to come back, and we relented even though we really didn't want CPK today.   Unfortunately, she wasn't given the opportunity to eat there today because the service was so bad.  After waiting nearly 10 minutes to be seated (even though we were the second group in line and there were many empty tables), we waited at our table for almost 20 minutes.  No one came by.  No one asked about drinks.  And there didn't even appear to be much activity near us in terms of wait staff.  The employees we did see (most of them anyway) weren't hustling, and it was obvious that no one cared about the customer experience today.  We were hesitant to sit after the entry wait, concerned that it would be the same level of service once we sat down. Unfortunately, we were right.  With no one even meandering through our section, we finally gave up and decided to leave rather than start the dining experience nearly 30 minutes after entering the restaurant. There were a number of empty tables.  It wasn't a slow day, to be sure, but it wasn't a mall Saturday, either.  I suspect they just didn't have the staffing to handle the tables, but the answer to that is not to sit people and let them know up front where things stand.

Stephanie T.,"Richmond, Canada",85,152,2794,4.0,10/5/2014,"This was my first visit to California Pizza Kitchen and I had an okay time. At 2pm, we thought we would be able to get a table quickly. This was not the case. Oh well, we waited about 15 min which allowed us time to install the CPK app for a free ""small plate"". I felt like the service was a little slow here. Our waiter, Travis, was very friendly and patient. After we ordered, we expected to get the complimentary bread soon after. I was starving so I really wanted to eat something quick. However, after waiting for about 15 min, we decided to ask for it. After we did, it came shortly. For our free small plate, we got a shaved mushroom and spinach flatbread. This was the perfect size - four pieces for the four of us. It was quite tasty as well and super cute! We ordered the California club pizza, which is first baked with bacon, chicken, and cheese, and then topped with a salad, basil, and avocado. I found that the basil was too much as they were literally placed almost whole on top. I like basil, though, so it was ok for me, but I can imagine others not feeling the same. I really liked this pizza! We also got a White pizza and added bacon for $1.59. This was also quite good, very cheesy. I found that these pizza crusts got chewy and hard and difficult to eat after it got cold. We also got the fish taco. It only came with 2 tacos, some salsa, and chips. The fish was mahi-mahi and was quite good, obviously good quality fish. The portion was quite small for the price. I love coleslaw though, so this was pretty good for us to share. Overall, food was good and service was good. For a chain restaurant, I would say it met my expectations. I would definitely go again when I'm in the states and they had it somewhere nearby!

It's like that most weekends.  The good thing is that it's in a mall and you can occupy yourself with other things. They started a new system that texts and calls you when the table is ready so it makes it much nicer. It's an updated store since it's a pilot location. For food I normally get the jambalaya or the Kung pao spaghetti. Both are good not great. A bit too much overpowering flavor on both. The pizzas are good but I do t find them filling enough for me. Prices feel a bit high for the value you get, but maybe they are going for a more upscale price point. My major annoyance with CPK is the bread. First you have to ask to get it served. Then they give about one slice of a baguette per person. I want bread, not bread crumbs! Aside from that though, the restaurant is always busy for good reason.

Our servers in the past have been quite attentive, checks in to see if we need anything during the meal, after the meal. Grabs dishes that have piled up. Refills on drinks.  You know the drill. On Sunday we had Mary. Now while she was friendly and helpful in taking our orders there seemed to be a lacking component of follow up. The kids meals came first. My mom ordered a salad and I had soup. It took a full 20+ minutes before our items came to the table. By then the kids were done eating their pasta. She noticed their drinks were empty at that point but made no special trip in between to see if we needed anything or to even let us know about the delay in our meals. Once we were done we sat there. We watched people come and go. We watched people being served. But Mary was everywhere else. Anywhere else. We finally had to flag her down to order dessert and get our check. I still had to ask her to remove some of the excess plates on the table. This is not typical by any means.

Ramya R.,"Rochester, United States",0,1,,1.0,7/5/2017,"So I have waited for two weeks to write this review to give them a fair chance. I had ordered a takeout where I specifically told them (multiple times) to leave the chicken out when making the salad (which btw costs 15 bucks for god knows what). Looks like the chef forgot and put it in anyway and at the last moment removed it. When I opened it, there were little pieces of chicken in it. This has happened to me in other places and I understand that not many people ask to leave the meat out. When I called the manager, he refused to cancel the order (the other places have offered to do that) and would only allow me to pick up another one. On top of that he definitely was talking down to me like I was lying or something. I did not have the time to go back and he said he will drop in a gift card instead and took down my address. Two weeks later, I am still waiting for my gift card and paid $15 for food I could not eat.

I did try the Carnitas tacos once and they were dry and unsatisfying..  I do believe this was a rare occasion but wouldn't order them again. I feel the menu is also a little overpriced.  Overall..

I was never a big fan but I once had a gf who was really into the tostada pizza so we would eat it from time to time. While the interior is certainly much nicer, gone are the ugly 80's lemon yellow paint and in is the new sleek rustic wood nightclub look.   However the pizza is garbage. I will preface it by saying after a trip to naples a couple years ago my pizza palette was refined. There are two categories; good and basically frozen s$@!. CPK falls into the later, the tostada tasted like taco bell leftovers thrown on a slice of bread. Basically vomit in my mouth.

Anthony D.,"Royal Oak, United States",118,73,4,2.0,6/12/2012,"I only went here to take advantage of an American Express cash back offer.  I think it was something like spend $25 and get $10 back.  I wasn't too impressed overall and I don't think I would be back unless someone else was paying for it. The food itself is very mediocre.  I know I shouldn't expect much from a national chain like this, but I still ended up being disappointed.  The pizzas are small and expensive.  It was average at best.   The service was slow and crappy, and I really don't feel it was our server's fault.  It is clear to me that CPK values table turnover above anything else.  The moment any party would get up to leave, the bussers would swarm the table like locusts and get it prepared for the next group who was seated immediately.  This process seriously took less than 30 seconds.  This would be all fine and dandy if the servers and floor manager actually paid attention to the people who were already seated.  Unfortunately once you're seated, they no longer care. It took a while to get greeted by our server due to his section being hopelessly over-sat.  He didn't have time to wipe his ass, let alone pay enough attention to us. My girlfriend ordered a wine sampler, and the wine glasses were dirty.  One of them had a big gross lipstick print on the rim.  It didn't even look like the glass was washed. When we unrolled our silverware it looked pretty rough too.  We tried to flag down our server, but he was visibly overwhelmed and speedwalking from table to table.  We saw a manager talking to a group of bussers, presumably cracking the whip to increase table turnover.  When she walked by our table, we tried to flag her down as well.  She just kept walking and we never saw her again.  Eventually our server came back to check on us, and we informed him of our filthy glassware/silverware.  He apologized and quickly replaced it for us. In the end the server was able to get a manager to remove one of our appetizers from our total.  While that is a nice gesture, it's not enough to convince me to come back.  It's obvious to me where CPK's priorities lie, and it's not on customer service or food quality.

CPK as a chain is not bad and I'd give them 4 stars.  The portions are very small but they offer interesting toppings on the pizzas particularly (such as pear or artichoke).  Plus I love how I recently noticed on the menu that they have posted detailed information for vegetarians and vegans ( ), allergen information ( ), gluten free options ( ), and nutritional information ( ).   This is EXCELLENT and SO HELPFUL.  I think more restaurants should do this. It does state that there may be some variance between locations so I always still ask.  At this location, the waitress seemed to have no clue about what could be vegetarian.  Honestly, she seemed uninterested in helping.  I stuck to a salad which was sad.  I don't know if the information on the website was available then but I could have used it.  She should definitely have known more.  For comparison purposes at the Farmington Hills location at least they tried to help.  Not only should she have known more, her service was so slow.  She only checked for refills of water once and asked how our food was once.  We were there for one-and-a-half hours most of which was waiting! I know this location is busy but service was slow at the other location mentioned too (Farmington Hills).  I really hope that improves.  Still, I'm very happy that this is one chain that has gone out of its way to work with vegans and vegetarians.  Hopefully the cheeses listed are free of rennet and hopefully a vegan cheese option makes its way onto the menu too.  Thank you (as a chain) for at least for providing such detailed information.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy?start=40
Emma S.,"Oakland charter Township, United States",0,18,4,1.0,7/8/2015,"I have been to this particular restaurant dozens of times. I would've given my service a 3 or 4 star rating, but today when I visited I felt almost annoyed about my experience. My mother and I walked in and was able to pick our spots by the bar. The second we sat our purses on the counter and was barely on our seats, the waiter asked what drinks we wanted. He quickly grabbed the drinks and about 1 minute into our visit he asked us what we would like. I politely asked for more time to look through the menu. Mind you, the restaurant wasn't particularly busy yet this bartender/waiter was being a bit pushy. After ordering, as my mom and I were sitting there enjoying each other's company, I hear our waiter obnoxiously holler to a cook that I had a nut allergy, which I had told him when I ordered my food. I am almost sure that everyone in the restaurant heard him. He apologized but I was still a bit ticked. Time passed, and our waiter and a few of his coworkers were joking about how another coworker has the tendency to never pay for his food. They started harassing that employee in a funny matter. I thought it was funny at first but the employees got so loud it was very distracting! Almost immature. Eventually the food came out, and as my mom was in the bathroom when her plate arrived, the waiter asked me to press my finger on the pizza she ordered to make sure it wasn't cold. Like, wtf? California Pizza Kitchen more like Pizza probably shipped from California  and put into a freezer for months. Now that really irritated me, but as a frequent customer I was even more appalled when the waiter came out with a cup of my tortilla soup, which is usually boiling hot and filled to the rim. This time, I was given a Lukewarm 1/4 filled cup of soup, took me about 30 seconds to eat.

Esther G.,"Brooklyn, United States",135,383,29,2.0,23/1/2013,"I would never come here unless I was already at Somerset and even then, it's for the convenience factor of not having to trek to the South end.  Getting seated immediately happens almost never. The wait is always 15 minutes for more. You would think by now they'd figure out a buzzer system so people can pop in to nearby shops, but nope. Your entire party must be there when your name is called, which is hard enough to hear anyway if you're waiting because it's so loud. As for the food, it always sounds better than it actually is. I've had other pizzas before but I can't recall what. Our meat cravers is a crispy thin crust. Good luck eating a slice without having all the ingredients fall because the crust isn't thick enough to hold the Italian sausage, bacon (both very skimy), pepperoni, ham and salami. The ingredients were small bits of meat, but the sausage was not. Seriously, they all kept rolling off! It also could use a more sauce. The field greens salad in a dijon balsamic vinaigrette was the best part. An abundance of fresh greens, with pears and walnuts that provided a balance of savory, sweet and juicy.

Not that the food is bad here, it just is never as good as you think it should be (something that I find to hold true for most chain restaurants--even more expensive ones).  I had that new Habenaro Pulled Pork pizza, which, I gotta admit, was quite good, although not as good as the menu made it seem (maybe they just hire brilliant menu writers at these places??).   Also, I wish they would give an option for smaller, lunch portions.  My girlfriend and I came here for lunch, but I'm pretty sure we ordered off the same menu that is used for dinner.  Both of us were stuffed after eating not even half of our pizza, and, although it made for pretty decent leftovers, I would have preferred to pay maybe $3-4 less for smaller portion.  Maybe even more of a ""personal"" pizza and small salad combo or something.  While I'm not going to hate on CPK, just be prepared to spend about $15-20 per person on food that will almost assuredly not blow you away.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy?start=40

The tiny pieces of steak were tougher than shoe leather (as was the flour tortilla they served it in.) The sauce had some heat to it which was nice but the flavor was so overwhelmingly soy sauce that it just tasted bitter. My husband liked the lettuce wrap appetizer he ordered. He was kind of irked that it came unassembled.  I ordered the Tostada pizza with lime chicken per Yelpers recommendation. The crust was more like a fried chalupa rather than pizza crust and I didn't like it. The chicken was so puny that I dug through the mess on top just to make sure it was in there. The toppings were okay but again I wish it had pizza crust.  My husband had the pear gorgonzola thin crust pizza and said it was just okay. He said the pesto chicken pizza is much better. We ate here on a Saturday night around 8 pm and the place was packed. We were told the wait was 20-25 minutes but actually waited 40 minutes.

I mean I am a normal weight 20 something girl and I eat 4 slices most days.  Their brownie dessert is SO yummy, I recommend it. Also the mac n' cheese is really good and they've made an adult sized bowl of it when I've asked which is really nice of them.

After about another 10 minutes we received our sodas.  When she tried explaining there specials to us, she was pretty much whispering and looking at the ceiling and everywhere around her.  when we finally got our food, Rachel's Cesar salad was actually warm, and the cheese on my ravioli was starting to harden.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy?start=60
D M.,"Dallas, United States",13,126,,4.0,8/7/2011,"A pleasant surprise. I usually avoid the chain restaurants, but we were at Somerset and hungry so we decided to give it a go. The server was awesome, but all the kids (Sunday afternoon) and their inept helicopter parents were obnoxious.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy?start=60
Jim S.,"West Bloomfield Township, United States",0,35,7,4.0,1/8/2012,"My 13yr old son and I stopped here for dinner tonight while at the Somerset Collection.  I've been here numerous times, and have generally had good meals here.  But this time CPK really impressed me.  We ordered the Dynamite Shrimp for an app., which both of us enjoyed.  Not particularly spicy, but tasty.  I had the new-ish Habenaro Carnita pizza (pulled pork, red onions, cheese, cilantro over pesto spread w/ spicy sauce on the side) and he had BBQ Chicken Hawaiian pizza.  After finishing our starter, we sat talking for maybe 10 minutes until my son commented the pizza was taking a bit longer than usual.  Not absurdly long mind you, but slightly longer than expected.  Just then, our waiter Jeffery came by and apologized for the wait, mentioning that our pizza had burned, and they were making new ones.  Within minutes a woman I presume was the manager brought our pies, and apologized for the wait.  She then told us both pizzas were on the house!  I can't recall the last time a restaurant pulled 1 main course off my bill after a (slight) wait, let alone 2.  A comped dessert yes, but this is the type of customer service I thought was long gone.  Kudos to CPK for going the extra mile!  By the way, we both thoroughly enjoyed our pizzas, and still would've even if I'd paid full price for them.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy?start=60
P K.,"Troy, United States",117,27,4,5.0,25/4/2011,"So far so good. I've tried numerous things like chipotle chicken, vegetarian pizza, and etc. The vegetarian pizza is probably the best vegetarian dish I've ever had. The service is good and the food comes out pretty fast. The only thing I recommend is to make a reservation, because it's usually packed with people!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy?start=60
Jimmy A.,"Franklin, United States",0,1,,5.0,19/5/2013,I really love there pizza and there service is the best I would go 100 times more.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy?start=60
Brian L.,"Oakland County, United States",0,6,,5.0,28/3/2011,"Best pizza I've had in my life, Meat Craver's was great every time. My only quarrel is with their selections, as their wine is lacking and they have only exotic appetizers. Still great.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy?start=60
Jim M.,"Clarkston, United States",0,1,,4.0,22/1/2013,"I have been here many times in the past, the last time about a year and a half ago.  Since my last visit they changed the recipe for the Thai Chicken Pizza.  I will just say the new pizza is not nearly as good as the old one.  Overall the restaurant was very good, I just did not care for the new recipe.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy?start=60
Jessica Y.,"Chicago, United States",31,254,24,5.0,12/4/2008,"Another one of my absolute favorite chain restaurants, and this just happens to be the location I've eaten at a lot.  The service here is great and I recommend sitting at the bar when you're in a hurry over lunch break.  You can order off the regular menu here and the bar tender/server is right at hand.  I recommend the BBQ chicken chopped salad and the santa fe pizza.  The tortilla soup is a good starter.  The thai chicken or margharita pizzas are also delicious as well as the Waldorf chicken salad.  The few items I want to try are the goat cheese pizza and the tricolore salad pizza.  I'll keep you posted on the verdict.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy?start=60
