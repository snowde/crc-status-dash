Christina C.,"Tucson, AZ",27,123,38,4.0,8/4/2014,"My experience at this location has always been great. We had such a great experience at the bar one time. I believe his name was Jose, my apologies if I am wrong. He was very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu. I decided to eat here on my birthday and we had another server who was great and made great recommendations. Although this is a chain pizza place and can be a little pricy, I really enjoy the atmosphere and staff.  I used to really enjoy the BLT Pizza which is no longer on the menu, but if you ask nicely they can make it for you. :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson
Shijie F.,"Sunnyvale, CA",220,256,334,5.0,2/9/2014,"You can get really cheap pizza or really expensive pizza almost anywhere. But one true tried, tested, and trusted pizzeria is California Pizza Kitchen. I've never had a slice of pizza that I won't eat or I don't like there.  After a slew of disappointing dining experiences elsewhere, I brought my Chinese parents to this place and they LOVED it. It literally met every criterion for a Chinese diner: reasonable price, check; good portion, check; tastiness, check. PLUS, we appreciate the fact that this is pizza as good as it can get, without bogging us down with an appalling amount of grease and cheese.  Sure, it is a chain and maybe lacks a bit individuality or ""gourmet-ness,"" whatever you may call it. But in terms of pure enjoyment of food, I like it much more than most places that sell cheap pizzas or really expensive pizzas. Because it has amazing consistency.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson
Kathy N.,"Tucson, AZ",235,375,644,4.0,7/16/2012,"Arrived on Saturday at the Tucson Mall starving and since Choice Greens (formally Chopped) is no longer a lunch option at the mall, we decided to hit California Pizza Kitchen. Such a nice little oasis in the sea of crappy mall food! Located just outside the mall over by H&M it's far enough removed that it's almost like you're not at the mall at all. It was really packed when we arrived and had to wait in the small waiting area with a number of others, two being mothers/grandmothers with ginormous strollers that blocked the door and bench seating. Rude. We opted to eat outside and were seated within 7 or 8 minutes. The skies were all dark and gray and it was a steamy day as a monsoon was soon approaching but with the outdoor misters, the environment was cool and pleasant. Didn't wait long at all for a waitress and we decided to try out the sangrias. One red and one white: White Caribbean Sunset Sangria which is a blend of mango, apple, pinot grigio, passion fruit rum and peach schnapps and comes decorated with pineapple fronds(?), pineapple and a maraschino cherry. The Red Appleberry Sangria was raspberry, orange, lime and cranberry, merlot, Tuaca & sour apple pucker and came garnished with thin slices of green apple and limes. Both were good but the white was much more refreshing. Went with salads for lunch, just half portions which were more than enough for a lunchtime meal. In fact, there is no way we could have finished full salads. I had the Cobb with bleu cheese (added beets to the salad) and it was tasty. My dining companion had the Waldorf with the Dijon balsamic vinaigrette. Both salads were fresh and delicious but nothing to write about (ha! Punny....since I'm writing about them!). Next time I'll try one of the more interesting selections. All in all, a nice dining experience. Service was attentive without being obnoxious and the outdoor patio dining was a welcome retreat from the hustle and bustle both inside the restaurant as well as inside the mall. Next time (yes, I'd go back) I think I might have to try the cranberry walnut chicken salad sandwich and a refreshing Paloma!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson

Summer R.,"Tucson, AZ",81,146,15,2.0,6/24/2014,This place was packed the night we decided to go eat. We wanted to go to another restaurant but it was too packed is there was a game on.  It took us about a half an hour to finally be seated and the server came over about five minutes later. He promptly took our drinks and took about another 5 minutes just for him to come back. I asked him for some sugar for my tea. he went and grabbed the sugar gave it to me and then disappeared for another 10 minutes.  I finally got frustrated as both of our children were very hungry and we'd already been there almost an hour. I grabbed one of the food runners to get our server she ran back never to be seen again.  I found a server and told her we needed to order food. Finally the manager came out as we had been there about 20 minutes sitting alone not to mention already being there just waiting for a table.  She apologized profusely and offered up an appetizer. we accepted. She came back with fish crackers for the children and advised that it was not good that we were there for 20 minutes and had not even been able to order. After that it was quick and the food was good but we can't make children wait that long.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson

I used to love and and now it is just pretty pricey for the quality of pizza. I got the white pizza with the smoked applewood bacon and it was probably the worst white pizza that I have ever had. Their bread from their mini menu was good. They did a fair job on refilling my water but other then that, not even their service was exceptional.  I say skip. There is better pizza here in Tucson.

Our server was extremely rude by calling everyone on the table ladies, when my boyfriend has already pointed out that he is not a lady and ask not to do that again.  We ordered pepperoni pizza and it was already cold when it got to the table. When we asked for the bill, he brought it and took so long to pick up the bill because he was in the kitchen talking with other servers who are not doing anything. 20 minutes later, I became weary and would really like to leave. I asked the host for a manager and explained the situation. The manager came over but he didn't really do anything to fix the situation.

Rachel D.,"Elgin, IL",10,108,29,5.0,2/16/2014,"I used to eat at CPK,, but then I stopped for 10 years when I was eating Gluten Free because they did offer a Gluten or Allergy Free menu. I was back on Gluten for 2 or 3 years but then stomach was sick all the time so I went back off Gluten again.  Love the Allergy & Gluten Free Menu, I ordered the Original BBQ Chicken Piazza which comes with BBQ Sauce, Grilled Chicken, Cilantro,  Red Onion and Smoked Gouda Cheese on a Gluten Free Crust without the Smoked Gouda Cheese. The Gluten Free Crust was just like a thin crust or a flat bread piazza, the crust was great, it is quite rare to get a good Gluten Free Piazza Crust.

Lauren K.,"Tucson, AZ",81,338,81,3.0,10/15/2011,"CPK is a place we like to go to two or three times a year.  It is decent, but better when it's been a while in between. We tried the new fried mac n cheese bites for our appetizer.  They were priced right, and a good enough portion to split with two or three people.  The taste was just ok, nothing special.  The layer of panko was a little bit too thick, making them slightly dry.  I would eat them again if someone ordered them, but I don't think I'd order them for myself. The pizza we usually choose is the Chipotle Chicken pizza.  It has a nice amount of spicy elements, the chicken is seasoned fine, and the chipotle sauce they put on it is tasty.  The best part is they have a slightly sweet dough, which is especially good on this pizza to balance the spicy elements. I also enjoy their Four Cheese Ravioli.  They're cheesy, but not overwhelmingly so.  The sauce is creamy and has lots of what looked like fresh basil. The service can be better sometimes, but on this visit, our waitress was very good.  She always had our drinks refilled, and she was very friendly.  The restaurant has nice decor and was clean.  Overall, a good experience for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson

Ashley J.,"Tucson, AZ",67,310,214,3.0,4/29/2013,"I love the CPK pizzas, and I've dined-in at different locations, but yesterday was my first time to try this location, here in Tucson. And??? Not impressed. They had a big sign out front boasting ""We're more than just pizza!"" so I thought - why not? Lets try something else (my usual is a salad & pizza that I split with the hubbs). We started with the ""avocado"" egg rolls. I say it in quotations because it should have been called ""chicken"" egg rolls. Seriously. there was a teeny, tiny sliver of avocado that you couldn't even taste because it was overpowered by the chicken. Tasted okay (I'd give it a B+ grade), but nothing spectacular and certainly not what I was expecting since I thought it would be predominantly avocado (silly me!) For my entree I asked the waitress for her recommendation. I wanted tacos but there were a couple different types and I was torn between fish tacos (mahi mahi) and carnitas tacos. She said to go with the carnitas, for sure. The conviction made me think they must be stellar. Unfortunately when they came out....not so much. Honestly, the meat tasted like it'd been cooked 3 days prior and had just been sitting there in the back. Not fresh or juicy like carnitas are supposed to be. Really, it tasted like more chicken that had been cooked in some sort of flavoring packet (carnitas is supposed to be pork!) It was very disappointing. I'd give it a C- grade. Finally, the beverages.... I was excited because their menu boasted ""fresh squeezed lemonade"" with various flavors. I LOVE fresh lemonade so I was all over it! Well, if by ""fresh"" they mean ""fresh from Minute Maid"" then maybe I'd agree. Definitely did NOT taste fresh at all (no lemon pulp or anything that would hint that it was truly freshly squeezed). Additionally, all the flavors were nothing but syrup - no real fruit at all. I tried a strawberry lemonade then switched to raspberry lemonade for my refill and both just tasted like straight sugar-syrup. Very disappointing (a grade of C or C+ at best). Overall I'd say - stick to the pizza. That's what they know how to do and thats what they do best. Although I also have to say that when I've visited other locations I've had a very different experience so maybe these problems are exclusive to JUST this location. Either way - if you're trying something other than pizza, order at your own risk!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson

Saba B.,"Tucson, AZ",371,431,81,3.0,1/14/2013,"I enter mall mega-chains with extreme trepidation, and I can safely say that CPK isn't as bad as some of the other mallstrosities, although watching  teen shoppers traipse in and out of H & M is an ambience killer. My partner had a gift card though, so we had nothing to lose. His chicken piccatta was actually tender, moist, and lemony with spaghettini on the side rich with capers and lightly oiled. My roasted veggie salad was huge even though I ordered a half, and whoever manned the grill left them just crisp enough to add pop. The service is sharp, although they must be trained to turn over tables at a blinding rate because we must have been asked if we were ready to order five or six times when we hadn't even glanced at the menu.

Steve K.,"Tucson, AZ",58,26,5,4.0,4/19/2012,"I was really surprised to see the run of poor reviews of this CPK at the Tucson Mall because we have had overall excellent experiences there, so I am adding my honest opinion here because I would hate to see a good place like this disappear. This review is based on our numerous experiences here over the past year and half since it opened in Tucson.  We are a family of four which includes a 3 year old and 7 year old, and on average we eat here about once or twice a month.   THE FOOD.  We try to eat as HEALTHY as possible, and when we go out, we attempt to do the same knowing that it isn't always going to happen.  In that regard, we find that CPK is a nice compromise with pretty healthy fare which also tastes fresh and clean.  For appetizers/soups, we can recommend the Lettuce Wraps, Tortilla Spring Rolls, and Artichoke and Broccoli Soup for the freshness, tastiness (without tasting overly salty or fatty), and presentation.  We also like the Korean BBQ Steak tacos.  For  those of you familiar with Korean BBQ, the steak in this dish does NOT taste like Korean BBQ.  When they first introduced this item, it tasted just like Korean BBQ, but they changed the sauce so it taste less burnt and a little more sweet and spicy.  I am Korean and I prefer the original, but this new sauce is acceptable especially when you are living in Tucson.  We do not recommend the Spinach/Artichoke Dip because it gets cold very quickly and seems to have more of a heavy buttery taste to it.  The chips were fine. For entrees, we like several of the salads including the BBQ Chicken Chopped and the Caramelized Peach.  On the BBQ Chopped, I ask for them to use about half to three-quarters of the dressing they normally would, and it suits me just fine.  Of all the pizzas, we like the Greek with Avocados sub'd in.  Their other pizzas are good too, but we like this the most because we think the fresh vegetables and make it less heavy yet very tasty.  Of their pasta/specialties dishes, we enjoy their Kung Pao Spaghetti, Asparagus & SPinach Spaghettini, and Norwegian Salmon.  The portions are not crazy big yet filling, and the flavors suit us by being good but not salty or oily.   The Kids Meals are reasonably sized and enjoyed by our children.  They come with an entree and drink.  Our 7 year old always gets the buttered noodles and shares with the 3 year old.  For the three year old, we order the artichoke and broccoli soup.  The servers count the soup as her entree and give her a free drink as well.   We haven't tried the desserts and cannot speak to that.   THE SERVICE.  I've noticed many people have complained about how poor the service is, and we have not had that experience overall.  Now, on one occasion, I had the waitress accidentally spill cold water on my right leg.  However, I did not get angry because I could tell she was flustered by how busy she was, and I could also see she was really sorry.  I think good service equates to attentiveness, and I have found that most of the servers are just that.  On our drinks,  they routinely bring out fresh refills for us and exchange our glasses before we get to the bottom.  They return to our table often enough that we do not feel like we have to wave someone down.  Lastly, when we are getting ready to leave, they offer us to-go cups with fresh refills.   Overall, we have enjoyed our experiences at CPK.    One other thing I might mention is that we have done take-out a few times, but it just doesn't feel the same.  I would recommend dining in over pick-up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson
Brittany S.,"Tucson, AZ",74,68,54,3.0,3/4/2014,Havent eaten here in years and won't go back. We ordered the white bean hummus which was tasty but at almost 900 calories I can't afford to eat it. They pour oil on top which I know a lot of places do but it didn't need that. I love the mushroom pizza but also incredibly high in calories. The waitress also gave us free dessert for my pizza crust being burnt but actually it wasn't burned at all. literally not a black spec on it. The dough was perfectly crispy but moist.

Anna D.,"Tucson, AZ",17,27,19,1.0,1/22/2011,"My first visit to a California Pizza Kitchen, but definitely my last.  The only variety of flavor with their food: bland, sweet, or peppery.  I'd say the service was good, but in reality, the service started going downhill as soon as my guest and I started voicing our disappointment in the food. The open kitchen keeps things noisy (to cover up kitchen sounds), and there seems to be too much wait staff for the size of the establishment (there were always a rotating gaggle of servers standing off to the kitchen socializing with each other) and the front is too small to accommodate people waiting for to-go, people waiting to get seats and the 2-3 hostesses gathered around the podium.  That being said, the plushy booths are comfortable and the framed vegetable art on pizza boxes is unique to their restaurant concept.  Our server was prompt and polite when she first came over, and seemed excited about the restaurant offerings, which we thought a good sign. Unfortunately, the food. I ordered the Jambalaya and my guest ordered the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine. The Jambalaya was flavored primarily with pepper (maybe to hide the otherwise bland taste), the chicken was overcooked, and the sauce (which absolutely does not work with linguini...although I can't think of anything it would work with) was greasy and any other spices used were overwhelmed with pepper taste. On a positive note, the shrimp was not overcooked, but the pepper sauce made it unbearable to eat.  My guest's dish was bland (the only taste of lime was the lime squeezed on it, and even then was no more than the thought of a hint of lime flavor), the chicken was again overcooked, and the sauce had a slow building sweet flavor without any trace of supposedly spicy jalapeño. My guest was extremely hungry and willing to eat his bland pasta (especially compared to the disaster that was my plate), but I couldn't continue.  When I told our server about how the food wasn't what we had expected, she said she'd get me something else. Figuring that my mistake was in not ordering a pizza (it is, after all, California PIZZA Kitchen), I ordered the BBQ Chicken with Applewood Smoked Bacon Pizza. They're a pizza place, so going with a pizza (with bacon on it no less) is a sure thing, right? Wrong. The pizza was drenched in bbq sauce, making it overly sweet, and the bacon tasted like sugared chunks (I never thought I'd say this, but the bacon actually made the pizza worse!) instead of being salty, which might have cut the overwhelmingly sweet taste of bbq sauce. I will say that the chicken, this time, was NOT overcooked and the pizza was fresh out of the oven. At this point, our server had become visibly annoyed with us for not liking ""her"" restaurant's food.  My guest and I (both still hungry) and now irritated, decided to cut our losses and leave.  The manager came over and tried to rectify the situation with coupons, which was a nice gesture, if I was ever going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson?start=20

Joshua B.,"San Francisco, CA",82,223,491,1.0,12/27/2010,"California Pizza Kitchen is a unique place, in that they print on their menus the fact that you don't have to pay for something if you don't like it. The idea seems simple enough. I thought putting that on their menus was more of a gesture than anything else.  Seems like printing something like that stand show a certain level of confidence in the food; however, it turns out they have to print that on their menus. Because their food is terrible! I've been here twice now.  My first experience had terrible food and good service.  My second experience had terrible food and even worse service.  This is not a combination I ever want to try again.   When the service was good, our server was always efficient, prompt, and polite.  The server tried to make maintain a rapport with the guests.  My guest and I never had to wait on refills.  Our server went out of the way to make sure we understood the food replacement guarantee (I was impressed by that) and tried to get us something we wanted.  Ultimately the food drove my guest and me away. I decided to give CPK another try and went back with a different guest last week.  Our server was rude, impatient, and went out of the way to try and embarrass us for not liking the food.  We didn't get refills in a timely manner, and trust me when I say you'll want a lot of refills when trying to eat the food here.  When we asked for the check, our server got the manager instead.  (My guest and I were hungry, and trying to leave to go get food we would actually eat.  We didn't want the manager, we just wanted to leave.)  I'm not sure why, but the manager offered my guest and me free food on our next visit, but I assure you I'll never be going back to there.  This time it was both the food and the service which drove us from the restaurant.   The atmosphere is hip and modern.  The open kitchen design creates makes things quite noisy though.  Strangely, the service staff seems to have nothing to do as many times on both visits they would be gathered in large groups, standing around and chatting.  (Which made things a little uncomfortable for my guest and me, because the staff was always gathered near out booth.) Now for the food... I ordered the Wild Caught Mahi Mahi and my guest ordered the Chicken Marsala. Neither of these dishes was what we expected from the menu.  My Mahi Mahi was bland, beside the faint taste of lemon (which I had squeezed on it).  My guest's chicken was served as a pasta and was completely tasteless. (Funnily enough I took the chicken home to my dog and she wouldn't even eat it!)  Our replacement dishes on this visit were the Greek Pizza and the Jerk Chicken Pizza. Our new dishes were the exact opposite of our first dishes.   The Greek Pizza was not what I anticipated from previous experiences at other restaurants. It wasn't bad, but it was not anything unique or amazing. It was basically a Greek style salad on pizza crust. It tasted okay, but was very disappointing from a restaurant that supposedly specializes in pizza. The Jerk Chicken Pizza was utterly disgusting! While the Chicken Marsala had no flavor, the Jerk Chicken Pizza had far too much. The chicken has a jerk flavor in the background; however, it is drowned out by an overly sweet sauce, too much cinnamon, and a strangely sweet crust. The Jerk Chicken Pizza tasted like a cinnamon roll, with extra sugar, too much cinnamon, sweet bacon, a little chicken, and sweet peppers sprinkled on top. Both pizzas were served luke warm (but in record time). On the second trip I ordered the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine and my guest ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  My Chicken Tequila Fettuccine had a very sweet taste.  Even after squeezing additional lime on the pasta, the only flavor it had was an overwhelming sweetness.  My guest's BBQ Chicken Pizza drenched in sweet BBQ sauce!  Both the chicken and the bacon had the same sweet flavor (which overpowered both the chicken and bacon flavors).  I really have to wonder if the ""chefs"" there can make anything that has a flavor other than excessively sweet. I tried to eat here twice, but I can guarantee I will not be going back here.  This place is more of a terrible experimental dessert shop than a restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson?start=20

The Split Pea Barley soup has always been one of my favorites...sooo good. And if you come here you've got to try a Pizza. It was my Dad's first time at CPK so I stuck with an oldy but a goodey the Garlic Chicken Pizza. Sweet roasted Garlic make this an awesome pizza and the dough they use is amazing (make sure to request Honey Wheat dough if you're interested). We tried the Grilled Vegetable Salad (whole size, not half) and it was HUGE with grilled mushrooms, asparagus, corn, tomatoes, zucchini,  green onions...etc, all tossed in an awesome champagne vinagrette.   The total for the two of us (although we did go all-out)? In the realm of $60 ($72 including tip) for artichoke appetizer, Grilled Veggie Salad with Chicken, Garlic Chicken Pizza, a Mai Tai and a Mango Mojito.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson?start=20
Annette S.,"Tucson, AZ",2,18,,4.0,3/16/2014,"The pizza was good, the service was above-average.  Beverage choices were good, comfortable outdoor seating overlooking a fountain.  Cool when it may be hot outside.  The only disappointing feature was there was no cornmeal crust available, but other than that, it has a lot of positives.  If cornmeal crust is important to you, then don't eat here, but if you can handle deep dish or original pizza crust, then you can get by with this.  Other pizza restaurants tried may have the thin crust or cornmeal, but the pizza is put together like a McDonalds style which defeats the quality.  If you want to catch up on the latest sports news, you'll be able to do that here because they have wide screen televisions (36 or 48 inch screens).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson?start=20
Steven G.,"Tucson, AZ",40,93,7,3.0,7/31/2011,"Happy Birthday to my friend Amanda Y! She had a large group here for her birthday dinner and to start off they were very accommodating to our group size. It was about 20 people. Furthermore, their service was great along with the overall cleanliness and decor of the restaurant.   Unfortunately, that is where the praise stops. My group ordered a bit of everything from appetizers, pastas, and the pizza. For the most part everything had great presentation but when it came to taste it was mediocre for the most part. The taste just didn't justify the high prices. There is definitely a better substitute for everything at CPK nearby and if I ever wanted to get good gourmet pizza I would go to Zachary's Pizza on 6th Street. However, if you need a large group and want a place that serves a little of everything the CPK would be a good option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson?start=20
Lisannette R.,"Tucson, AZ",122,64,10,3.0,6/5/2011,"Round Two: I think I like the appetizers better than the pizza.  We ordered the Tortilla Spring rolls (Thai and Baja Chicken) and boy-o-boy, DELISH.  We also ordered the BLT pizza and the Five Cheese pizza.  What originally reeled us in was the description of the BLT:  ""Loaded with bacon.""  It was anything but loaded with bacon; two or three tiny pieces here or there.  The Five Cheese was better, but needed a little encouragement with some parm and chili flakes. My partner and I have decided that we'd rather go to Brooklyn or AZ Pizza Company if we have a hankering for some Gooood pizza.  If we're looking for a restaurant experience with decent pizza we'll THINK about CPK, and maybe go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson?start=20
Brenner T.,"Tucson, AZ",121,96,30,4.0,6/2/2012,"For a chain restaurant, I had a superb experience here. As Steve K. mentioned, I'm very surprised by the amount of unhappiness expressed by other Yelpers, but I guess I should add my two cents!  Came here on a Wednesday night around 7:00 and it was maybe half full, but outside patio seating seemed busier. I sat at the bar to watch the Heat vs. Celtics game (go Celtics!) and I was helped within 30 seconds of sitting down by hands down one of the friendliest bartenders I've encountered. Yes, people in this industry do need to be upbeat and positive towards customers, but I felt that she was just genuinely friendly to both myself and the other patrons. Caitlyn may have been her name, but I'm not sure..I'll edit that later if I remember. My water glass was never empty and she wasn't pushy about ordering cocktails.  I started with a Caesar and it came out promptly. Good execution, but still a basic Caesar salad. Unfortunately, I was only halfway done with my salad when the Hawaiian Barbecue Pizza I ordered came to the bar...and just sat there while I finished up my salad. Call it picky, that's fine, but I prefer spacing between courses like that.  Nevertheless, I started on the pizza and was content with my choice. Semi-crunchy thin crust and fresh toppings were abundant on the pizza and I had plenty to take home for lunch the next day. The aforementioned bartender noticed throughout my meal that I was downing water like there was no tomorrow and brought me a to go cup filled with more water. Now, that's what I call service. I left her a plentiful tip and went on my way. Maybe try the bar if you're looking for efficient service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson?start=20

Kate L.,"Tucson, AZ",83,146,46,3.0,4/26/2011,"Meh.  That pretty much describes it, for me, unfortunately. I've heard about CPK for years and years, and was thrilled when we finally got one in Tucson. The restaurant was lovely, the outdoor patio nice, and the service was good.  But what you are there for is first and foremost the food, correct?  That was the ""meh"" factor I'm talking about.   We started with an appetizer of spinach and artichoke dip.  Meh.  I didn't think it tasted that great, but my husband didn't mind it and finished it off for us.   We got the Roasted Chicken Pizza to split between us.  For the $13 price tag, we asked the waitress if it was big enough to share and she replied that it was.  The pizza came back smaller than the size of a large dinner plate... Slightly two small except for folks with the smallest of appetites to share.  I think it would have been more appropriately priced at about $10.  There was no option to get a larger pizza either, which I found to be odd.   We walked away somewhat unsatisfied... as I said, everything but the food was just fine, but what really counted was simply ""ok"".  I think in the future we'll stick with one of the many other dining options in the area, including my favorite, Cheesecake Factory (but I'm itching to try out that BBQ place too!).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson?start=20
Alicia L.,"Tucson, AZ",31,15,,2.0,7/15/2011,"After a recent outing to REI, my 5-year-old and I decided to hit CPK for lunch. I'll preface this review with the disclosure that I follow a gluten-free diet for strict health reasons; that being said, I planned to eat salad at CPK. Imagine my delight when I saw on their menu that gluten-free pizza crust was available for almost all their signature pizzas. I make GF pizza at home, but haven't eaten GF pizza at a restaurant in years. My kiddo ordered her cheese pizza, I ordered the garlic chicken. I think I was somewhere around the second piece of my pizza when I realized I was eating what had been, until twenty minutes earlier, a frozen pizza.  I realize that CPK is a chain restaurant, and it's not likely that many of their customers order gluten-free crust for their pizza, but ... the entire pizza had been frozen! The onions were anemic and the whole thing tasted of cardboard and freezer. It was so, so disappointing. I will never order another one of their (TWELVE DOLLAR) gluten-free pizzas again - IF we ever eat there again. My daughter enjoyed her cheese pizza, from the kid's menu, which in contrast to mine was definitely made-to-order. Our server was attentive and kind. We dined on the patio, which was mist-cooled and comfortable. The manager spoke to us after our meal. But I can't muster more than two stars because of the awful disappointment of a frozen twelve dollar pizza... I just can't.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson?start=20
Roger T.,"Tucson, AZ",407,250,614,5.0,3/13/2013,"This place is delicious! My friend brought me here as a late birthday present lunch and I had a great great time.The server was friendly and answered any question I had about the menu and she was quite humorous as well. I started off with an appetizer of chicken lettuce wraps and that was mighty tasty! It had a great dipping sauce that went along with it which was nice creamy and sweat but not too sweat. The chicken was cooked right and didn't have too much of an overpowering taste of the water chestnuts. As my main entree I ordered a Shrimp Zucchini, Fettuccine pasta! Try saying that 5 times fast! That was also delicious! The shrimp wasn't over cooked and still had it's flavored the the Zucchini was thinly sliced into the pasta so it was like you were eating the pasta with zucchini noodles. Which tasted great and was cooked pretty well to taste. As my beverage I enjoyed a full body 8oz of red wine of Melbot which went perfectly with my dish, Next time I want to the their own red wine that they brew which a story lies behind it about a surgeon who created that wine. So hopefully my next visit I will be able to try that wine and actually hit a pizza dish since it is called a pizza kitchen!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson?start=20

Sarah S.,"Tucson, AZ",200,133,4,2.0,5/25/2012,"Not the worst meal I have ever had, but far from what I expected. My mom had eaten at the CPK in Michigan, and had been raving about their food for months. So when she moved out here, I figured I would treat her to something I knew she liked. Bad plan. Apparently the food is different from location to location, and my mom hated it here. I had never had CPK, but this location makes me never want it again. The service was slow, and my $6 wedge salad was a tiny joke, a small wedge, tomatoes, and egg.... that was it for $6. I mean I understand the idea, but I thought I would get cucumber, croutons, maybe shredded carrot... something more for the price.  But I pushed on mostly because we had already ordered our entrees. I got a spaghetti dish with chicken, and a fancy name. All it was, is noodles, bland sauce, and a small amount of chicken on top. Boring. Really I could have gotten better at Olive Garden (which is where we should have gone).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson?start=40

I still have memories of one pasta dish I  had way back when and I have duplicated it over time. So, everything (except the sound level) was commendable. The service-Jacinta was great. My dinner partner and I  shared a field salad made with sliced pears, fabulous greens, and candied walnuts and a thin-crust Margherita pizza. The salad was so wonderful, perfect amount of balsamic dressing, greens were crisp and the pear slices and walnuts added both texture and sweetness, a perfect balance. The portion was startling-we were hungry and packed it in but there was really enough for 4 people on that platter. The pizza was delicious, great tasting tomatoes, just enough mozzarella cheese and basil, nothing dominated.  Crust was, as advertised ""thin"", a little charred, and just slightly crunchy. Left one of the 6 slices. Perfect  combination of salad and pizza. The bill with two non-alcoholic beverages was about $32 for 2. The menu is more than ample and very interesting. Small plates, appetizers, pizza, pasta, foccacia, sandwiches, soups, salads, and more and yet not so overwhelming as their competitor's next door.
