Gavin N.,"Bellevue, WA",460,642,382,4.0,1/24/2010,"California Pizza Kitchen has had kind of a weird history on Guam. It opened originally like 5-6 years ago and was pretty busy when Holiday Resort was originally Holiday Inn.  Then for some reason it closed down for about 2-3 years, and then suddenly reopened a year or two ago? The rumor is that the original CPK that opened was actually an illegal copycat but now it's legit (considering it's actually listed on CPK's website).   Anyway the pizza and food have been always of good quality and pricing. And the same quality you'd expect to get stateside. Believe it or not some chains do not translate well in Guam. I.E. Pizza Hut pizza in Guam is not the same as Pizza Hut pizza in the states (it's worse), but for some reason KFC in Guam is 10x better than KFC in the states.     The 3-4 times I've been to this CPK location (2 times since it re-opened) service has always been fast and friendly. What also is pretty cool about this CPK is unlike the CPKs in the states they have coupons every now and then which make eating out at a place like this very reasonable. IE. $20 for 2 pizzas (that normally cost $12-15/each) that easily feeds 2-3 people.     If you've never been to a CPK I highly recommend the sausage pizza and the California club.  The lettuce wraps are a great appetizer as well.  I also heard great things about their mushroom pizza which I will try next time I'm there. ~G",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tumon?start=40
Nyles C.,"Dededo, Guam",0,6,,4.0,8/22/2015,The wait was long but i really loved their Kung Pao spaghetti. I just hope the  next time i come here our server 'll be more attentive in refilling our drinks!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tumon?start=40
Emy P.,"Tamuning, Guam",1,17,,4.0,10/7/2014,"One of my favorite restaurants! For an appetizer, the dynamite shrimp is amazing! I think all their pizzas tastes great, but my favorite being the BBQ chicken pizza with applewood smoked bacon. It has such a unique taste to it and I've never tasted pizza like that before. Also a huge fan of their Alfredo pasta with chicken, shrimp, or both. I pretty much order the same thing every time and it always turns out yummy!  On busy days, which is most days, it is challenging to find parking. It gets so hectic with the restaurant and hotel guests.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tumon?start=40
Neil J.,"Burbank, CA",0,6,12,3.0,5/25/2015,"They are very busy around 6 in the evening so get there early.  The bar has only one TV.  They charge a 10% gratuity which is common in Guam. The prices are reasonable.  The fact they charge a $1 carry out fee while no other CPK does, keeps this place from getting a better review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tumon?start=40
Soy Sugar Y.,"Roseville, CA",5,17,,1.0,1/3/2016,"Worst service ever. Imagine getting there and being quoted 20-25 minute wait time. You keep seeing all these empty tables and they keep growing as time passes by. Why? Because they keep reserving each table that frees up for some reservation they wouldn't allow you to book when you called. So when about half the restaurant has empty seats, they finally seat you. But wait they're not done making you wait. 10 more minutes until a waiter shows up. And then it's so loud, he puts two salads on your order instead of one, gives you food without utensils or napkins or enough plates. Oh and the plates that was sitting there before? I wouldn't use them. They were dirty with food. And if that was bad enough, they run your card twice. Once at the front and once at the back, fibbing about something because they can't put together a coherent sentence why they're doing it. So now you have to check your credit card statement. And the sweet deal is that you are locked to paying 10 percent tip despite bad service from beginning to end. Pretty sure that's illegal if it was challenged in court. overall, a nightmare experience. I won't go back here again. Horrible service and oh, horrible food too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tumon?start=40
Derek K.,"Bakersfield, CA",28,6,,4.0,11/14/2013,"I've been to a CPK in California. This one costs a little more (Typical of Guam) and has a little less options for pizza. However, the food and service were good. The cooking time seemed a little long, but I was in a larger group and we weren't in a hurry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tumon?start=40
Shelby S.,"Inarajan, Guam",3,31,56,3.0,7/18/2012,"The only reason I give it a three is because I would hate for tourists to come to Guam for a short time and spend one of their meals here; I would hate for a visitor to come to Guam and visit the chains. We have great local food, but as far as chains go CPK so far is doing it right! REVIEW: The first thing that I would have to say about CPK is that if I walked into their restaurant and the only thing they had on their menu was their Thai Crunch Salad I would stay! Hands down one of my favorite salads and probably the best salad on their menu.  You cannot go wrong with any of their pizzas. I'd suggest the Wild Mushroom or Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage. I get either one depending on who I'm eating with, my vegan friend or my meat-loving mom. That's another great thing about CPK, they have something that caters to any diet. I've had their pastas before. They're delicious, but expensive...anyway CPK is not the place I come to when they crave pasta. Every time I come here the service is quick and friendly and most importantly the restaurant is clean!!! Considering the amount of people and noise CPK is actually pretty comfortable.  The first negative would have to be the parking. The parking is absolutely ridiculous. Whoever chose their location should have taken parking into consideration. The only parking available is shared by a public beach (about 10 stalls are always flooded) and although there is parking that is shared by the hotel I believe there is only ONE level of underground parking. Because parking is so bad I would have to say they're lucky they're located in a hotel in Tumon (this isn't a nod to the person who chose the location I believe they could have found somewhere in Tumon with better parking) where they can get a lot of foot traffic. However in my opinion, if you want to stay open you need to cater to your local clientele and I believe better parking would be a huge step in that direction. Another negative would be that they're always crowded. If you're not a fan of crowds or would like a more intimate setting avoid CPK. However if you have a large and loud group of people and could care less about noise well then CPK is a-okay for you! Overall, the good food, even though it is a chain, brings people back for more!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tumon?start=40
Maricris K.,"Norfolk, VA",0,160,,1.0,11/6/2012,go to hawaii or the mainland to experience this restaurant. the service was AWEFUL and the menu is WAY OVERPRICED!! $50 for 2 people (pizza and appetizer) !! what the heck! unbelievable...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tumon?start=40
Mimi F.,"Dublin, CA",26,28,14,4.0,2/2/2010,"most the staff at the back of the house has been there since the opening and this helps on the quality assurance front! love this place because it tastes just like its supposed to taste (like how I have it when I'm in California!)  Guam, however, has a limited menu and I am still waiting for the day they will add the pear-gorgonzola pizza for service!...I'm assuming pears and gorgonzola are just too pricey in this neck of the woods.  Parking is not the most convenient because the hotel's garage is a maze and sometimes you might have to park across the street or at the adjacent Matapang beach. Very reliable and because I was part of the design team that built this place, I have to love it for the ambience, lighting, and design :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tumon?start=40

Alex H.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,2.0,2/7/2016,"2nd time here and it's the slowest most mediocre restaurant around. I've ordered to-go, showed up later than the quoted time and still waited for 25 minutes to get my food. They weren't even very crowded and staff was definitely lacking in curtesy. There are a couple of similarly mediocre pizza places near by where people are much nicer so I'd totally recommend going there instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tumon?start=20
Kara J.,"Grafton, WI",38,9,1,5.0,4/15/2016,"The food was good as expected but what I was super impressed with was the service and teamwork shown by the employees!

Service was wonderful.  We were greeted and seated as soon as we came in.  Our waitress was friendly and patient with us while we were trying to decide what to order.  After our orders arrived, she stopped by a couple of times to check on us and our waters, which is a big plus for me.  Also, our food came in a timely manner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tumon?start=20

Shannen W.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",36,29,55,4.0,7/25/2014,"All I have to say is AVOCADO EGG ROLLS!! They are so delish. It is usually one of the primary things I order here. It is an appetizer that comes with two types of sauces for options in flavor. Aside from that, everything I have tried on the menu thus far is really good. My favorite pizza would be the original bbq chicken pizza and as for pasta I would go with the garlic cream fettuccine. It is a bit pricy considering how little their portion sizings are, but the food is good.  The interior gives off a warm feeling since it is a bit dim, but it is also very clean and inviting. The servers are also really nice. I would definitely recommend this place to those who want a variety in pizza and pastas. And if you are not in the mood for that they have tacos and sandwiches.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tumon?start=20

Everyone ordered the appetizers and beer, which took awhile to come out. The egg rolls were really good, I highly suggest them. After we order our main dish and it arrived, we were told that they were out of ingredients. We asked was this know before we ordered, and of course it was, the pizza was way over cooked but had a good taste. I would recommend this place for a small party but would advise to go somewhere with a large one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tumon?start=20

They need to work on the right mix, but overall very good.  - wifi; I'm a stickler for this, esp. on a business trip, and the offer it.  - excellent manager. I find a manager who actually works the floor visits tables in high regard I can see this restaurant hah taken a few hits in the past. The manager I met with, Debbie Eding took no effort to hide her knowledge of it. She welcomed reviews based on your visit today.

Elle L.,"Riverside, CA",0,6,14,4.0,9/9/2017,"We tried some new items - Chorizo Fundido Dip and California Club Pizza. We would not recommend them. The dip was okay. The cheese was kind of watery. Not a lot of chips were provided to finish the dip. I had to ask for more chips and was charged $2. This is the only restaurant that I've been to that charges for refills for chips. The pizza looked like they just poured sliced avocado and lettuce. It was not as good as their other pizzas.  The spicy seafood pasta was really good though. Not overwhelmingly spicy but with a little kick. I was disappointed that they removed the portobello mushroom ravioli from the menu. Hope they bring it back.

We came here 2 days in a row to have some thin crust pizza and salads. The Thai salad is really good but the avocado was very bruised the second time. I like the thin crust with artichoke but the one with sausage and some sweet sauce was terrible. For some reason the artichoke pizza tasted different the second time.

I had to ask for a bag just to load the salad inside. I also had to ask got forks and stuff at which they rolled their eyes like I'm nothing. I don't think you will be getting anymore orders from me.

It's not the same flavors or menu from the CPK in the mainland and the flavor profile is definitely different and lacking.

John C.,"Borrego Springs, CA",1,9,2,2.0,3/9/2016,"The food is great, if you get it.  The problem is your chances of getting your food are really really bad. I'm 3 for 3 not getting my food... at least not in a timely manner. FIRST TIME: I ordered a pizza and my girlfriend got a salad. The salad came out 20min after the pizza.  I can only assume they were waiting on the lettuce to ripen.   By then we had both ate the pizza together, so the salad was completely unnecessary, and a horrible leftover meal. SECOND TIME: It had been a month before we tried again.  On the first trip we got the dynamite shrimp appetizer and was dynamite, I loved it. So I figured what the hell I would go in for a drink and an app. It took over an hour to get our app after ordering. I can only speculate that they we're trying to get me to order more of they're over priced drinks.  THIRD TIME: It had been a few months since the last ordeal and I had a gift certificate, so let's try one more time! I figured I would go in at the end of lunch time when they were slower than dinner time, what the heck...it could not happen three times and that shrimp is really good! I was wrong! I started with the shrimp, it came out quickly and it was great. Finished it and after my 3rd iced tea (30-40min after ordering) I'm just thinking ""This can't really be happening again!!"" I ask the waiter if there is something wrong. He explained that the other server had given my pizza to the wrong table. I look over to see them eating my pizza as well as receiving their pizza order.

Elle L.,"Riverside, United States",0,6,14,4.0,9/9/2017,"We tried some new items - Chorizo Fundido Dip and California Club Pizza. We would not recommend them. The dip was okay. The cheese was kind of watery. Not a lot of chips were provided to finish the dip. I had to ask for more chips and was charged $2. This is the only restaurant that I've been to that charges for refills for chips. The pizza looked like they just poured sliced avocado and lettuce. It was not as good as their other pizzas.  The spicy seafood pasta was really good though. Not overwhelmingly spicy but with a little kick. I was disappointed that they removed the portobello mushroom ravioli from the menu. Hope they bring it back. Next time, I'll stick to ordering their older items. Their service varies from good to exceptional.

We came here 2 days in a row to have some thin crust pizza and salads. The Thai salad is really good but the avocado was very bruised the second time. I like the thin crust with artichoke but the one with sausage and some sweet sauce was terrible. For some reason the artichoke pizza tasted different the second time.

Gavin N.,"Bellevue, United States",460,642,382,4.0,24/1/2010,"California Pizza Kitchen has had kind of a weird history on Guam. It opened originally like 5-6 years ago and was pretty busy when Holiday Resort was originally Holiday Inn.  Then for some reason it closed down for about 2-3 years, and then suddenly reopened a year or two ago? The rumor is that the original CPK that opened was actually an illegal copycat but now it's legit (considering it's actually listed on CPK's website).   Anyway the pizza and food have been always of good quality and pricing. And the same quality you'd expect to get stateside. Believe it or not some chains do not translate well in Guam. I.E. Pizza Hut pizza in Guam is not the same as Pizza Hut pizza in the states (it's worse), but for some reason KFC in Guam is 10x better than KFC in the states.     The 3-4 times I've been to this CPK location (2 times since it re-opened) service has always been fast and friendly. What also is pretty cool about this CPK is unlike the CPKs in the states they have coupons every now and then which make eating out at a place like this very reasonable. IE. $20 for 2 pizzas (that normally cost $12-15/each) that easily feeds 2-3 people.     If you've never been to a CPK I highly recommend the sausage pizza and the California club.  The lettuce wraps are a great appetizer as well.  I also heard great things about their mushroom pizza which I will try next time I'm there. ~G",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tumon?start=40

You keep seeing all these empty tables and they keep growing as time passes by. Why? Because they keep reserving each table that frees up for some reservation they wouldn't allow you to book when you called. So when about half the restaurant has empty seats, they finally seat you. But wait they're not done making you wait. 10 more minutes until a waiter shows up. And then it's so loud, he puts two salads on your order instead of one, gives you food without utensils or napkins or enough plates. Oh and the plates that was sitting there before? I wouldn't use them. They were dirty with food. And if that was bad enough, they run your card twice. Once at the front and once at the back, fibbing about something because they can't put together a coherent sentence why they're doing it. So now you have to check your credit card statement. And the sweet deal is that you are locked to paying 10 percent tip despite bad service from beginning to end. Pretty sure that's illegal if it was challenged in court. overall, a nightmare experience. I won't go back here again.

Shelby S.,"Inarajan, Guam",3,31,56,3.0,18/7/2012,"The only reason I give it a three is because I would hate for tourists to come to Guam for a short time and spend one of their meals here; I would hate for a visitor to come to Guam and visit the chains. We have great local food, but as far as chains go CPK so far is doing it right! REVIEW: The first thing that I would have to say about CPK is that if I walked into their restaurant and the only thing they had on their menu was their Thai Crunch Salad I would stay! Hands down one of my favorite salads and probably the best salad on their menu.  You cannot go wrong with any of their pizzas. I'd suggest the Wild Mushroom or Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage. I get either one depending on who I'm eating with, my vegan friend or my meat-loving mom. That's another great thing about CPK, they have something that caters to any diet. I've had their pastas before. They're delicious, but expensive...anyway CPK is not the place I come to when they crave pasta. Every time I come here the service is quick and friendly and most importantly the restaurant is clean!!! Considering the amount of people and noise CPK is actually pretty comfortable.  The first negative would have to be the parking. The parking is absolutely ridiculous. Whoever chose their location should have taken parking into consideration. The only parking available is shared by a public beach (about 10 stalls are always flooded) and although there is parking that is shared by the hotel I believe there is only ONE level of underground parking. Because parking is so bad I would have to say they're lucky they're located in a hotel in Tumon (this isn't a nod to the person who chose the location I believe they could have found somewhere in Tumon with better parking) where they can get a lot of foot traffic. However in my opinion, if you want to stay open you need to cater to your local clientele and I believe better parking would be a huge step in that direction. Another negative would be that they're always crowded. If you're not a fan of crowds or would like a more intimate setting avoid CPK. However if you have a large and loud group of people and could care less about noise well then CPK is a-okay for you! Overall, the good food, even though it is a chain, brings people back for more!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tumon?start=40

Mimi F.,"Dublin, United States",26,28,14,4.0,2/2/2010,"most the staff at the back of the house has been there since the opening and this helps on the quality assurance front! love this place because it tastes just like its supposed to taste (like how I have it when I'm in California!)  Guam, however, has a limited menu and I am still waiting for the day they will add the pear-gorgonzola pizza for service!...I'm assuming pears and gorgonzola are just too pricey in this neck of the woods.  Parking is not the most convenient because the hotel's garage is a maze and sometimes you might have to park across the street or at the adjacent Matapang beach. Very reliable and because I was part of the design team that built this place, I have to love it for the ambience, lighting, and design :)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tumon?start=40
A K.,"Casper, United States",21,34,,4.0,26/2/2011,"A four star review on a chain restaurant? Seriously? Yes. CPK on Guam is great! Great wait staff, great management, clean, organized, and overall a nice place to eat. Why the four stars? Their localized foods on the menu! The Chamorro Pizza was AWESOME and I told the manager that it should be on the international menu.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tumon?start=40
