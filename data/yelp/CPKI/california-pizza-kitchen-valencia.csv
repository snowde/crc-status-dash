Suzy L.,"Elk Grove, CA",19,81,8,5.0,1/11/2018,I love this place.  I probably could eat here every day.  We find them all over this state and know we can always rely on delicious fresh made food! Must try the carne asada pizza.  Omg! Thai pizza delicious.  Red Velvet cake is the best I've ever had.   The BBQ chopped chicken salad is perfect. Thee eggrolls are yummy.   See I told you I love this place!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia
Tee S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,70,40,5.0,12/13/2017,"We went here in the early afternoon and it was not busy at all. The customer service was perfect, everyone was super nice and our food was delivered quickly.  I highly recommend trying the butter cake with ice cream! It looked plain but what surprisingly good. I'd best describe it as a sugar-cookie cake, and I'm not even a huge fan of sugar cookies.  I will definitely be back in here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia
Gwen M.,"Valencia, CA",105,220,127,4.0,11/16/2017,"I visited today with a friend for lunch - it was my first  time at  the Valencia location.  We arrived at about 11:30am and the place was mostly empty and the music was far too LOUD. I was also underwhelmed with the architecture; the CPK in Burbank is far more charming. The space here in Valencia felt like a big rectangular box. I ordered split pea soup (our server volunteered that this  only vegan option for soup, not that I cared because I'm not vegan - but it was very good and included barley and carrots in the recipe) and the spinach salad that included apples, pecans, and quinoa. Both were exceptionally good, as was the passion fruit mango iced tea. Honestly though, $3.29 for iced tea? That's a bit outrageous.  The service was very good and the staff was attentive without being annoying. I like that, so I'll go back, but I'll just have water.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia
Angela P.,"Austin, TX",1747,153,428,3.0,12/10/2017,"I used to frequent this location quite a bit when I worked in the area. It's a great place to meet friends for lunch and relax. I ordered a salad with an individual pizza loaded with veggies. The veggies were fresh as well as the other ingredients. However, there wasn't enough cheese or sauce on the pizza. It was like eating veggies on pizza crust.  The side salad was okay. I can't remember the exact name of the salad but it's a common salad served at many restaurants. The service was good. There's nothing overly spectacular about California Pizza Kitchen. It's a nice place to meet friends and eat food that's just okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia
Danilo A.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2,174,578,4.0,11/11/2017,"As we walked up one of the hosts opened the door for us. That was very pleasant gesture. We were sat immediately and offered drinks. Our server Sara brought us bread took our order and within minutes we were eating. The BBQ Chicken salad was delicious, next time BBQ sauce on the side. The carne asada Pizza never disappoints my better half it tasted great! The chicken pasta for me, not so much. Sara was very attentive and checked on us constantly. We will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia
Shawna R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",77,227,435,4.0,6/7/2017,"I've been coming here since it opened. My service has always been great and I've never had any issues with the food.  Last night came in with the bf for dinner. Our server Aaron was awesome, great customer service and checked up on us a bunch. Our food was really good, they did accommodate  our request. I asked if they served sides separate, they do not.. however the bf did ask for extra potatoes and they were able to make that happen. We also ordered some dessert. The buttercream cake is a bit on the sweet side, but was still good and very filling.  Overall everything was great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia
Greg B.,"San Diego, CA",74,298,200,3.0,6/21/2017,"Here's the thing: I just gave a CPK in San Diego a 4/5. I of course take into consideration the experience and service in addition to the food. The reason for the 3/5 for this particular location is that the pepperoni pizza, which is really a flagship of the chain, just honestly wasn't that good.  The experience was a perfect 5/5. The service, again, 5/5. Our server was awesome. Unfortunately I forget his name as it was a few weeks ago. Aaron? Chase? David? I think it was 1-2 syllables. Sorry, I'm a jerk.  Anyway, I think CPK does a bang-up job of hiring and training because it's always an enjoyable social experience. I actually had a CPK gift card that I've been carrying around in my wallet for a number of years and conveniently had an opportunity to use it, so we went a little crazy and ordered some appetizers of pita and hummus and chicken dumplings. The dumplings were great. Probably the best part of the meal, which was a problem because the pizza should have been the showcase here.  It just felt like the thing could have used an extra minute or two of cooking time to solidify all the cheese in the center of the pie. Unfortunately, that is kind of a personal pet peeve of mine when pizzas are runny in the center. I know the restaurant is busy on a Saturday night but this is THE Pizza Kitchen, man! You run the kitchen, it doesn't run you. Anyway, it was a good meal and I had a fun time. I would come back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia
Jay D.,"Valencia, CA",93,39,114,5.0,7/16/2017,"I'm stuffed as I write this review. Came in for lunch. Completely forgot their specials are Monday through Friday (I came in on a Sunday). No big deal, just means I'm getting a full sandwich instead of a half sandwich. I ended up boxing one-half and taking it to-go. It comes with soup as well, and their soup is great. I've tried most of them and I've never been disappointed.  My table also started off with the avocado rolls appetizer. These rolls are thicc and come with ranch and... Thousand island (I think??). Super good apps.  They also offer iced tea and lemonade in baits flavors. I always get the strawberry lemonade. Yum.  Servers are very active, opening the door for you on your way out/in, seating you in a timely manner, and taking orders. They do so accurately and with a smile :). It's all around a pleasant experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia

Brigid B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,8,2,1.0,12/30/2017,Gave this place another try. This time take out. Take out portions are smaller.

Nancy B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,4,4,1.0,9/27/2017,"Struck out twice at this location. Came in on a Sunday. They had a 15 minute wait. We (party 5) waited 45 minutes. The reason for the long wait according to the hostess they didn't have a table available to place a high chair. We noticed several tables were open. We left the location and decided to eat else where.  Came in on Wednesday. The wait was 15 minutes again. Several tables open, however the waiting area was packed. The front counter person said all servers were busy and they could not seat anyone else at the time.

Steve B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",6,105,3,2.0,8/30/2017,"I went here for lunch on 6/15/15. The place is very clean and modern looking, but other than that I wasn't impressed.  When I entered the place I was greeted with a curt ""How Many?!"" instead of a ""Welcome to CPK"", ""Hello"",""Good Afternoon"" or even a smile.   The staff are much more interested in talking with each other than paying attention to the customers.  Plus, when my pizza came it was supposed to be a sausage, pepperoni & mushroom.  It had lots of mushrooms, but 3 pepperonis and 2 (yes 2) pieces of sausage.    I've been here three separate times and was treated with the same disdain each time.  Time to go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia
Alexia M.,"Valencia, CA",38,23,2,1.0,8/26/2017,"Worst service ever! Called in an order and they said it would be ready by 9:20, got to curbside at 9:20 called them as instructed to let them know I was there. They said they would be right out as it was ready.  Waited 25 minutes and called them again. They said it was ready it would be right out. Waited 5 more minutes before someone came out, not caring that I had sat there for 30 minutes and was concerned about the freshness and it being cold. He said it had been under warmers for the past 30 minutes! OMFG! So by the time I had got home the cheese was re-coagulated and stiff!  Called 8/26 to speak to a manager about the $35 charge on my credit card for two cheese pizzas and they transferred me to a hostes! Not a flipping manager!  I am so done with this restaurant! The pizza from there tastes just like the crap you get from the freezer aisle of the grocery store!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia
Marie H.,"Los Angeles, CA",212,13,,2.0,9/1/2017,"I placed in an order for delivery to our office today, and was hoping to have a nice Friday catered meal for the team. When we first started the order online, it prompted us with about 19 minutes of a wait time - no big deal. But as people started entering their orders, the time time increased all the way up to a 70 minute wait time - so we hurried up and placed the order!  So, the time for our food delivery comes, and passes, but no food. One of the employees called me and apologizes, saying somehow our order (which we paid extra for delivery) was entered into the system as pick up, and it's been sitting out, waiting for pick up for *over an hour*. She said she's going to remake the food for us and have it delivered, but we'll be waiting even longer now. Why wouldn't they have called us earlier if the food was sitting out for over an hour without a pick up? I get errors happen, but, we're hangry. And now you get this hangry review. I left 2 stars because at least I like the food but this is a little ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia

Miss T.,"Glendale, CA",1,169,289,1.0,7/30/2017,"Terrible terrible terrible management- I called three times to make sure I had a reservation and make sure the table was ready for when I arrived for my sisters surprise 30th birthday dinner. Guess what I arrived 5 min late table was not ready, staff was messing around instead of opening the door for me (other Cpk's do this on a regular basis)when I was carrying balloons and a cake. When I asked is the table ready they said no we are wiping it down. What was the point of calling three times if nothing was done- to top it off the restaurant was not even busy. Let's move on to when I start setting items on the table and the hostess Jillian  was placing the forks on the table and said ""what's the problem! The tables ready?""  If your still setting the table up, the floor is filthy and the bench was filthy and your giving me an attitude and the restaurant is not busy- I wonder what the management is like and what type of establishment they are running. I promptly asked for the manager and he greeted me I told him my concern of the the table not being setup and how ride the hostess was- he said ok. 5 minutes passed and he didn't go speak with her or even acknowledge that he was sorry. Long story short we left- not going to support a business that has poor management and rude staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia
Eileen D.,"Los Angeles, CA",210,253,764,3.0,1/3/2017,"It's more of 3.5 than a 3 but the wait time was just too long for almost everything so I leaned towards the 3 than a 4. So, yea what everyone is saying about the wait time is here is sadly true. We go seated right away. We're told our server will be right with us and when she passed by our table she acknowledged us and did say she'll be with us in a few. It prob took more than 5 minutes for our poor waitress to get to our table. I would say the resto was more than 1/2 full but it seems that they're short staff. I took advantage of my free small plate rewards and got a corn guac with chips, it was pretty good. Our main dishes took really long, like more than 15 minutes long. The hub truly enjoyed his chipotle pizza, i had some and it was not bad, it's not your typically greasy pizza so, yea that was good. I got the zucchini shrimp pasta and it wasn't that bad, it could be improved but I guess it's like asking for more calories :) We ordered a citrus cooler with strawberries and it was refreshingly good, I'd order that again.  The waiting game continued again with the check and they forgot to remove our chips and guac but the waitress took care of it after apologizing. Overall, the staff is great, they're just overwhelmed.  We've been to this location a few times the past 2 years so I won't say I wouldn't care for CPK, but I just wish they can improve on this waiting game. It really breaks the dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia
Thai G.,"SYLMAR, CA",23,15,1,1.0,10/7/2017,"Love cpk. Have been to several all over The Valley and LA but this once has terrible service. Our server never offered refills for our drinks, nor asked if we wanted anything else and instead just brought the check when he assumed we were done with our meal. I don't know but waiters should have personality and be more mindful of the dining experience they are creating. Because even if the food is great; if the service isn't then that ruins your meal. It did for me on this day, came to celebrate a birthday and instead of being offered dessert, I was given the check before I was even done with my food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia

Aileen K.,"Los Angeles, CA",2084,665,924,4.0,5/16/2016,"Love, love, love coming here for family gatherings because family style ordering is so easy and cheaper here. I usually leave not LOVING the food, because it's A-ok. Sometimes the portions are too small to make it worth the price, or sometimes they completely miss on the pizza flavors. However, I must admit the most recent time I came on Mother's day, the food tasted exceptionally wonderful. They either stepped up their game...or maybe we are simply learning how to order better dishes. We always start off with the yummy cocktails and avocado egg roll appetizers. The egg rolls are a hit with any age group and although sometimes they overfry it and make it too greasy, it's still almost always really tasty. I mean, avocado and bacon with chicken...what's not to love? We then ordered the sicilian pizza, veggie pizza, garlic cream fettucine, and the pesto creme penne pasta. I didn't try the veggie pizza because I need my meat but everything was so delicious, and the pesto creme penne became my new favorite. We ordered it with shrimp and the shrimp pieces were generous and the pasta was bursting with flavor.  We also got the halibut and although we didn't expect much from a pizza restaurant, it was surprisingly good. However, they could have cooked it a little less to keep it tender. Lucas was a great and attentive server. And thanks to Ruby for being so friendly on the phone!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia?start=20

Shimon B.,"West Hills, CA",10,44,18,1.0,5/28/2017,My kids and I stopped by the restraint after my sons first hockey game in Valencia for lunch. You would think it would be easy and quick. Unfortunately communication was a major issue for the server we had.  I ordered something very simple and easy. Of course the lack of caring for what I wanted came into play.  The order came out wrong and I sat there for 10 minutes while my kids enjoyed their lunches. I asked for sugar at the beginning of the meal which 30 minutes in still have not gotten.  Apparently the server didn't give a crap Since he came to the table a few times and didn't have the courtesy to apologize.  The manager thanked me for my feedback which upset me more since I was so upset that I sent the food back.  These bog corporate restaurants/machines don't stain their employees to actually care about getting things right.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia?start=20
James E.,"Chula Vista, CA",36,174,367,2.0,5/6/2016,"Service was kind, but very slow. Had to keep looking for the waiter to get water, or utensils. The food, is overpriced, and for what you get, not worth it. Our bill ended up being $179. I don't know why people keep coming here. My sister ordered a fettuccine Alfredo pasta, and there was barely any sauce on it. It just looks like they dumped noodles on a plate and served that. ""There's the pasta, where's the Alfredo?"" I had to track the waiter down and ask for some extra sauce. My baby cousin wanted a pizza. The kids pizza is mostly bread. 4 slices of something that looks like you could get in a box at the grocery store for 4 bucks. Yet it, along with the pasta was about $15. We ordered noodles and salads, but it's all just so overpriced and bland, not worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia?start=20

David S.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",5,20,4,2.0,9/9/2017,"I have no problem with the place or the food.  My issue is with the one particular bartender who I've watched furiously scratch his beard, run his hands through his hair, and scratch his nose -- and then make a drink or plate food. This happens every time we see him there.  We've complained to the manager and general manager (she stood next to him once while he scratched for like 30 seconds). Don't know if they've talked to him, but he's still there scratch and rubbing before he makes your drink or plates your food. Bon Appétit! Update: CPK corporate reached out and asked me to submit a ticket via their support site. I did and the store general manager called me directly.  She explained that the employee had been retrained and asked to resign a hygiene policy.  Very responsive company, which is great.  My concern is that the manager told me she couldn't do much more, as she hasn't seen the employee violate the policy.  I understand this, but per my above comments, I watched him scratch for 30 seconds while she stood right next to him. In the end, the response is a bit of a ""we've done what we can, sorry"", so I'll just choose not to eat at this location anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia?start=20

Brooklyn C.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",5,10,6,1.0,11/24/2017,"How many ounces of chicken would you think comes on a $15 BBQ chopped chicken salad? After picking food up to go and driving home, we were appalled to find  chicken scraps on the salad...after digging through the pieces of lettuce thinking the chicken could be hidden, we found nothing! So, bringing out my trusted food scale, we gathered the few pieces to find that we were given a whopping 1.8 ounces of BBQ chicken on our $15 salad. Not to mention the avocado we added was less than a quarter of California's glorious creamy avocado. Calling the assistant gm at first was not wanting to refund the card saying we had to go in to refund it. He eventually said he would cancel and refund the whole meal, since we had two orders of pot stickers on there. I get you guys are corporate and have ounces to save.

The steak which I specifically put medium rare was WAY over cooked, very disappointed especially since I paid $30 for this tasteless over cooked piece of meat...The pasta was better but that's not saying much because it was lacking salt.

Everything. As a previous restaurant manager, CPK NEEDS to replace the restaurant manager at this location. He's rude, fails to see the problems in the restaurant, blames the customer and overall just doesn't have good restaurant manager implementation skills or attitude. Today, my BBQ chicken salad actually had avocado on it (which is a miracle in and of itself as they usually always forget it) but the salad tastes of one thing and one thing only, a chlorine chemical type taste. It's inedible. A $52 meal for two salads, and a kid Mac and cheese with fruit and both salads are inedible. Absolutely no excuse for this.

Eve B.,"Newhall, CA",1208,136,16,4.0,6/6/2015,"California Pizza Kitchen - Reboot! Kind of excited...the restaurant I grew up with, California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) has had a remodel...well...not exactly just a remodel. Met by Susan Halstead, the General Manager of our local Valencia CPK, the first thing she told me was that people that now walk in the door don't recognize that they're in a CPK if they haven't been to the Valencia location in the last two months. Susan turned me over to Cole Brocato, bartender and trainer, who has been here at our local CPK for 9 years. Cole said that they were focusing more on California inspired fare and less on pizza alone. Fresh ingredients, like California fruits and vegetables, are now more emphasized. Full Cocktail Program In providing ""unique spirited cocktails"" we had to try the Blueberry Ginger Smash - refreshing, tangy, reminded me of a whiskey Buck plus fruit - and the California Roots  avocado colors the drink, while mint and agave sour takes center stage in this unique cocktail.  The California Crush reminded Cole of traditional Valencia flavors, and we enjoyed the citrus and mint flavors that made me think of a white wine Sangria - only better. Our teen had the Fresh Strawberry Mango Cooler - a nice virgin drink that was both sweet and light. These cocktails are new at CPK Valencia and are only available in the remodeled stores. Cole said that eventually all of the restaurants will be re-done. And you can get all the classic cocktails, just like the BBQ chicken pizza, too. The cocktail recipes, Cole said, are unique to CPK. Yes, they can make a Lemon Drop but they can also make a cocktail with Domaine de Canton Ginger liqueur or St. Germain Elderflower. Cole said, ""Local citrus in cocktails, California wines; we make it fresh, trendy, and organic when we can."" Taste the Unique With the new rollout, and as they have locations all over U.S., they ""want visitors to be wowed on what California Pizza Kitchen is about."" Don't be concerned that the pizzas are now listed on a long ""side bar"" of the menu, your favorites, like BBQ Chicken, Thai Chicken, Hawaiian, etc., are still there. But you will also find, under ""seasonally inspired"" menu items, a Maine Lobster Flatbread (cool lobster, loved the dill, great with the California Roots cocktail) Roasted Garlic Chicken (super mist and flavorful) with Seasonal Vegetables, Ribeye (Another moist and ""never frozen"" with great marbling to give great flavor, liked the peppery spice and butter topped on this one, and Pinot Noir salt), California Fields Salad and Tricolore Salad Pizza. Under ""main plates"" - this is the ""middle section and where it's really at"" Cole said - the ""Halibut is never farmed, always line caught, cooked on a cedar plank and that keeps it moist."" And it WAS! Delicious, great medley of spices, definitely would order again. And though we were stuffed, Ed couldn't resist having one more bite before we wrapped up our leftovers. Lunch Duos on the menu are geared to foodies that want quality and watch how much they are eating. Small Cravers fit that bill too, and have more a gastro pub like items. All the cheese, goat and cow, is pasteurized, Cole added. Originally guests had several menus, now it's all in one plus a beverage menu, which is more standard. ""You're a pizza place, why do you have this steak on the menu?"" Cole says people sometimes ask and he tells them to go ahead, ""have the steak"", and then they get it. Final Touches We sampled the seasonal-only-always-sells-out Strawberry Shortcake made with sweet biscuit, with a surprise touch of candied lemon zest glaze sprinkled over homemade whipped cream. The decadently rich Butter Cake is made with a sliver of cheesecake, warm and covered in ice cream and whipped cream; something Cole says people skip appetizers to save room for. The S'mores dessert is served with a jumbo graham, dark chocolate chunks, milk chocolate pudding and torched marshmallows - a sticky gooey all-consuming delightful mess. Some of the restaurants build the bar around the kitchen as a showcase. We did enjoy sitting at the bar, it was definitely the center of the action. All menus have different pizzas pictured on the cover, and according to Cole, the servers try to hand guests at the same table different ones - nice touch! Cole added that they hire their staff based on them being the right person and not on having to have the two years of service experience. Our teen thought that was great. Finally, when we glanced around the room completely sated and packed up leftovers we noticed both managers serving guests, people looking happy, and maybe some room for more.

My wife had the Chicken Milanese.  She felt the chicken wasn't that great and was a bit greasy.  I tried it.  I felt that while it was a tad greasy and could have used some crunch, it was good and the sauce on top (tomatoes etc.) was VERY good. I had the mushroom pizza.  Both my wife and I agreed that it was actually one of the better tasting pizza's we had ever had. We had the butter cake.  While my wife and I have a ""favorite"" in California, this one was actually very good and worth coming there to get it alone.  Order it with ice cream.

Rick R.,"Los Angeles, CA",438,231,219,3.0,9/9/2014,"Of the 5 or 6 times I have been to this location, my experiences have ranged from below average to outstanding.  This last time in particular (Sunday, 09/07/14) was exceptional.  We had a large party of 14, and were seated promptly.  They were able to accommodate us on short notice and did not do the whole ""wait until your entire party arrives to seat you"" thing that some restaurants do.   Our server, Kristin, was outstanding at her job.  She was friendly, professional, and extremely patient with our entire party.  I can't imagine dealing with a large party (especially one with kids) is easy, but she certainly made it seem that way.  She was smiling every time we saw her, and she did not get a single thing wrong with our order.  She also kept the refills flowing without us having to flag her down...  She honestly did a better job solo, than other restaurants have done with multiple servers.  Excellent hire CPK. As for the food, I am not the biggest fan of their pizza, but it does the trick.  I tried out their crispy thin crust option for the first time, and was glad I did.  I found it to be much better than their regular styled pizzas, and will likely repeat the order the next time I come in.  Someone in our party brought an outside cake for everyone to share, so I was not able to confirm that their red velvet cake is still heavenly.  Assuming it is still the same brand/recipe as years past, then trust me when I tell you it is a must try.  Best red velvet cake I have tried on the west coast. Overall, while Kristin and their red velvet cake are 5 stars, the pizza is just not good enough for me to crave.  Given a choice, there are more than a few other local spots I would prefer for pizza.  Their pizza is not bad, but it isn't the best out there.  This is more due to personal taste as opposed to anything they are doing wrong, so I would still recommend you give them a shot if you haven't already.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia?start=60

After the manager left it just slowed to a halt.  The new manager works really hard don't get me wrong but he doesn't work smart. He's all over the place doing everybody's jobs but the problem is he should show them how to do it. The staff that was on point has all been replaced with lazy inept people who just figure that they will get the tip anyway. Our last ten visits have left us more and more disappointed. It's sad when you see a place like this decline so strongly. We used to come every week religiously and now it's maybe every other. They are extremely inconsistent. Sometimes if I order a full salad I get a half. They tell me it's a full but seriously we come all the time. It's annoying when you know you're being cheated. I enjoy their food and if I order a pizza it's usually dead on. Unfortunately I also like their salads.  The bread thing mentioned by others is accurate. We now usually get the bread around the end of the meal because apparently they have to wait for the yeast to rise. It's always ""in the oven and will be right out""    Seriously it's bread. They need to train the staff because they just stand around in the kitchen or at the empty bread section. God forbid you want a refill. And even when you mention it they just have the oh well attitude. I've been eating at Cpk in general for over a decade and it's hard to stay loyal here. I may just move to wolf creek where the manager moved to because he was awesome and so was the service under his watch.  This manager is too nice he would rather do the work of twenty instead of delegating it to the staff. The staff is changing too frequently so they don't seem to get the hang of it and god is it SLOW!!!

Promised my nieces and nephews that we'd go to Islands for dinner.  I was flying solo and chasing after these kids was like herding cats.  My nephew is 4 so he peed himself and we had to make a detour from Islands and head home so his mom can clean up the mess cause I don't roll like that.  So the girls made the kids eat at home and that blew my plans and made the kids cry.  Me, being their favorite uncle, promised that we'd at least go out for dessert so we came to CPK.   Here's where I'm going with this: I was tired and I knew that I'd pay at least $40 for ice cream so now I'm under duress with these kids.  I made the order and my server saved my ass.  She came back to the table with a kids menu that had the same exact thing they wanted for $2!  We changed the order, my tab was $9 and I tipped her $10 for being a super cool server.

It has everything I love in it, from FRESH avocado, sun dried tomatoes, pine nuts and red onion. Pre-tossed with a tasty vinaigrette dressing. Every bite has some of everything and I get sad when I see it's almost finished. I could easily order a 2nd, because I never want it to end, but I know I'd be full once it arrived. CON #1 at this particular CPK, seems to be filled with a LOT of young children, with parents who neglect to notice when their high pitched screams, running around, kicking the booth seats, jumping etc. We have had to ask to relocate to a less rambunctious area of the restaurant. And now when we arrive, the 1st thing we say after how many in our party is...""PLEASE seat us where there are no screaming children"", then we pray the next hostess does not seat that same issue in our area. CON #2 is the price of their wine. We really enjoy our wine, but we've come to realize drinking water is our better option at CPK. The price for a decent size glass of wine is upwards of $14+. We can go to Salt Creek and get an entire bottle of higher end wine on Monday night for $20, and on Wednesdays, 1/2 off per glass of wine...without all the rug rats screaming in the room. My suggestion, is since this CPK seems to cater to deaf parents who have no respect with rambunctious children, that you have an area designated for these families.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia?start=120

Jeff B.,"Los Angeles, CA",617,801,7330,2.0,6/2/2013,"(Dined 05/29/13 W @ 1:00pm): Pizza should be considered its own food group! The month of May's installment of ""Brand Specialists flee the coop for lunch get away"" found us at the California Pizza Kitchen located in the Bridgeport Marketplace. This location was far enough from our work campus so we didn't have to worry about running into other colleagues. After all, this was our time to get caught up with each other, aired any grievances about work, and generally sat back and let loose in the comfort and solace amongst ourselves. As you know, I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants for various reasons, but that's about all you'd find in ""Awesometown"". Our party of seven requested to sit in the outdoor patio and took advantage of the nice warm and breezy weather. Once we arranged a couple tables and settled in with menus in-hand, this was how the lunch break broke out...for me, anyway:   Caribbean Sunset Sangria ($8.00) - The mango puree caught my attention (as would anything with this fruit from the Gods) and I loved my frou-frou drinks. The drink arrived in a glorious vibrant orange color with blueberries and various wedges of fruit throughout, white wine, and apple juice that filled-out the goblet this was served in. As tasty as it was, it was short on the wine and alcohol as good sangria should leave one with a sugary fuzzy buzz, which this sadly didn't.      Habanero Carnitas Original Crust Pizza ($13.00) - To this day I've yet ordered any entrée other than pizza (heck, it's in it's name!; I've boycotted the beef dishes at El Pollo Loco on principle alone!). This small-sized pie consisted of slow-roasted pulled pork and housemade cilantro pesto with a side of ""seriously spicy habanero salsa"". I enjoyed everything about the pizza except the fact that the habanero was served on the side. I truly expected it to be marinated with the pork and not as an afterthought or condiment. Again, if it's in the name I expected it cooked with it. I wouldn't expect a separate dish of orange sauce at a Chinese restaurant if I ordered orange chicken! And the ""seriously spicy..."" was a complete exaggeration of the habanero sauce as it was more like a purring kitten...very tame.  Bread with Olive Oil Dipping Sauce (complimentary) - What can be said other than it's free, you could ask for more if you wanted, and I simply loved bread. That's it! Service - Overall, I was disappointed with the service, and I hoped they just happened to be short-staffed. Half of our party arrived and we requested to be seated out on the patio. I noticed only a table of two was being used yet we still had to wait, even after our entire party arrived. Then, granted we weren't immediately ready to place our respective orders and needed more time, our waitress took 15 minutes (yes, I timed it because I used to work in the service sector) which was unacceptable. We got our drink and food orders relatively quick, as well as the check once we were done, but they were slow on filling our water glasses and refillable drinks during our meal. Parking - This was a breeze since they shared an open lot that had a ton of spaces with other businesses in this marketplace.  Overall, California Pizza Kitchen was generic and very formulaic. With so many better gourmet pizza options out there these days, I felt CPK's been left in the dust. They did own this niche back in the 90's but didn't seemed to evolve. I found minimal value based on the prices, service, and experience noted above (my total bill was around $21.00 before tip), but when the few positives was the complimentary bread, that's a major issue. The atmosphere, décor, and ambience was modern inside with many booths and tables/chairs that filled the dining area. There was also a eating bar area that looked into the kitchen and pizza ovens. The outside patio was like someone's backyard with uncomfortable chairs and heating lamps for those cooler days or evenings. Since it was right at the corner of a busy intersection, the car traffic noise at times made it difficult to converse, but the sun and breeze felt nice. And, there were several TVs both indoor and outdoor, great for big sporting events. The attire was totally casual so normally I'd be in a t-shirt, boardshorts, and flip-flops. And they accepted my credit card of choice...AMEX!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia?start=100

Ailyne H.,"Valencia, CA",665,447,2370,3.0,8/12/2012,"Every now and then I find myself coming back to CPK time and again. They are obviously doing something right and upon my last visit they really 'wowed"" me. My sister, my nephew and I got got seated in their outside patio. Good choice as my nephew can't sit still for too long. My sis and I were able to take turns walking out the little side gate and take him to the man-made pond to feed all the ducks. I'm pretty sure this particular CPK has a lot of overhead with the complimentary bread they serve. Anyway, we only waited about five minutes (maybe less) before the manager came rushing out and apologized for the wait. I think since a nearby table had already complained they had been sitting out there for 10 mins and no one came by, the manager already assumed us to be in the same boat. I didn't mind. So, we got around to ordering: Chicken tequila fettuccine: God, I just love this dish. The richness and the lime, oooh-weee, it's carb-a-licious heaven! Sis got the chicken lettuce wraps... always a good, light and refreshing choice. I half-guiltily enjoyed my pasta and discarded any regrets of remorse because it was so damn good! We also each had a drink before our meal, I went with red wine and she got the strawberry basil mojito? Maybe I'm getting the name wrong, but she liked it. It was refreshing for a hot day and it had a nice kick to it! As were finishing up our meal, the manager comes back out (she'd already checked back on us a few times) to ask if we need any boxes, hands me a dessert menu and says ""Pick out a dessert, it's on us as we are sorry to have kept you waiting"".  WOW!!! Talk about AWESOME customer service!! I was floored. We weren't trying to get a freebie, but by chance, it fell into our laps!! WHY?? Because...because my friends, that's how you take care of your patrons... by making up for something they felt they were lacking WITHOUT you the patron having to ask for it! AMAZING. Well, thank you kind lady manager. I took note of your hospitality and will definitely talk you up to my friends and fellow Yelpers.

If I wasn't so hungry I would have sent it back. I picked at dish which was cold by the time it got to our table. Probably because the meat had been sitting all day. Plus my dish probably sat while the pizzas came out of the oven.  Point of this review is that you should just order pizza here. They look great. The rest of the food isn't even worth the price. And to add my tacos come at a pretty steep price at over 11.00 plus for just 2 cold tacos. I don't think I will return, I will go elsewhere. That's the nice thing about living here.

Sliced nicely in 6 pieces, two pieces each and maybe a bowl of salad with the appetizers, there is no room for dessert, but they do have a Belgium chocolate souffle with ice cream thing that is too die for, I just didn't order it, and can't really remember how much it cost. $41.15 for a nice quiet lunch not bad at all.

Not once, not twice, but on too many ocassions. This used to be our go-to place since it is very convenient when you have 2 tired and hungry kids who just want to get home and eat their food after an exhausting day.  I've also spoken to the manager a couple of times because it is just unacceptable when your staff can not fulfill a request (i.e., extra cheese on the side because your kids do  ot like their mac n cheese dry!) and you are paying the same amount of money as you would've elsewhere with better food.  So this past Valentines Day, my kids requested CPK and as much as I was hesitant to give in, I decided to give them another try since it is LOVE day and I'm sure they would do everything to make their customers happy that day. Hmmm...let's just say...I was wrong, unfortunately. Their pastas (I ordered 2 kinds) were VERY DRY and they did not even put sauce on it, but instead put it on the side! I asked for EXTRA sauce on the side for a reason! I didnt get ANY bread nor utensils (I did ask for them during the phone order). My kids didnt even enjoy their mac n cheese that even the leftovers were neglected and thrown away the next day! What a waste of my money! I realize I could've made another call to the manager, but I think that a phone call or two to let them know that there's room for improvement should've already sufficed. I'm just not one who would call to complain, esp when I'm ordering takeout so I can spend more quality time with my family and less in the kitchen! Needless to say, we will not be ordering from this place for years to come...unless ALL restaurants here in SCV are closed and they are the only ones open.  It's too bad this location can't get their stuff right. We love CPK! Just not THIS location.

First time, my elderly mother in law accidentally spilled her specialty drink, and they said they would have to charge her for a new one. She was nearly in tears from embarrassment! Second time was a work lunch with a large group and everyone's plates came out at different times. One person had to take her stuff to go because we ran out of time. Last and final time, came on a Saturday afternoon, and the restaurant was empty. Took at least fifteen minutes to get seated, then once seated, we were neglected by our waitress, and end up leaving because our kids got restless after being there an hour and still not having all our food. Manager did apologize and comped our two items we did eat, which was nice. But a little too late for me.

Me and my bf came here for the first time, it was busier than we thought it would be, forgetting that it was a Friday night. I was impressed right when we walked in... there was an employee standing at the door opening and closing the doors for the people coming and going, smiling/greeting/saying goodbye, I thought that was cool. At the hostess stand we were told it would be about a 5 to 10 min wait. It took pretty much exactly 5 min and we were seated. Then our server janelle came by, and she was amazing! She was super bubbly, helpful, and attentive. Stopping by our table often, suggesting dishes and drinks, and when we told her it was our fist time here she even came back and surprised us with a complimentary appetizer! One that we wanted to try but didn't end up ordering so we got to try it anyway! She also told us about a free loyalty program they have and seeing as how great the experience was I figured we would def be coming back, so I downloaded the app at the table. When you check in at the location, the app gives you a code to redeem to your server, so you can keep track of your spending, for every $100 spent, they give you a $5 credit back, also, first time users get a free appetizer, when I showed her the code she applied it and the free appetizer as well, so we got both our appetizers for free! We even ended up ordering dessert [the salted caramel pudding, yum] and while we were finishing up dessert, the manager, who's name was jake, came by to welcome us, and ask us how our first time was. Needless to say, we left with [overly] full stomachs, smiles on our faces, not that big of a dent in the wallet at all [especially after all the awesome freebies!] And we will def be coming back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia?start=180
Liz W.,"Santa Clarita, CA",24,76,30,4.0,6/11/2012,"Every time we eat here, I get the Miso Shrimp Salad. It's so good! It's light and healthy tasting, but so tasty with the avocado all mixed in. The portions are on the small side. The quality of the food is yummy- for example their spaghetti bolognese is quite good even though you'd think their specialty would be pizza, and that a place like Olive Garden should serve better tasting pasta than CPK but no it's totally the other way around.  The prices are on the high side for the amount of food. We're usually not totally satiated unless we're eating here not all that hungry in the first place. And then our bill is quite on the higher side of what we like to spend on a typical night out. So this tends to be a problem, and why we don't visit very frequently. We get the meal gift cards at a discount at Costco. That helps. If you go when it's really nice out, then either before or after your meal you can walk around and look at the ducks or sit on one of their benches and enjoy the weather or take a stroll over the little bridge and peer into the man-made lake.

The pizza was burned on the bottom, and the salad contained 8-10 micro cubes of chicken with wilted lettuce , and five micro shreds of salami, $14.00 for that ? Really ? My point is that this would have never been presented inside the restaurant like this. Best bet is to go inside and pick up your food, so you can confirm the condition ,and quality of your order.

The most innovative pizza I had ever tried.  I was so pleased to find a place that made little kid pizzas with whole wheat crust - so when I was in Santa Clarita I stopped by this location of the franchise and it was so like Denny's I couldn't believe it. It was noisy.  Service was so-so.  The menu had changed, there was no Thai style pizza, unless that had only been a Hawai'i thing. I guess any restaurant, even a place at the mall in Hawai'i is going to look prettier than a place on the mainland - but still - I was disappointed with the very plain decor, the cheap looking lighting fixtures.  For what you get the pizza seems overpriced.

Take-out orders are always wrong or poorly prepared with overcooked children's meals, wrong pizza toppings, wrong salad toppings, not enough dressings, wrong drinks, etc.. While dining in the service is extremely in-efficent with incompetent servers disappearing for more than 10 minutes at a time after promising to be right back with drink re-fills or additional requested meal items.  I would never step foot in here except that my wife and daughter are CPK fans. This location though is quickly curing them of this ailment. The only reason I'm not not giving one star is that atleast this CPK staff delivers terrible service with a smile. Kindness counts for something. If your looking for a better family option with consistently better food, service, and value then I highly recommend Stonefire Grill on Cinema Drive or Corner Bakery on the corner of Valencia & McBean Pkwy.

She shared the new menu options, new drink options, and other highlights. She suggested the Valentines Sweet Deal for 2.

The food arrived as the right time, each time, at the right temp, taste, and portion. We asked for containers throughout the meal for the leftovers and she was quick to take the large plates off and return with our food boxed up. Overall her service was great.

It's hard to pick a favorite, but if I had to, I'd go with the Pear & Gorgonzola, which came with a tasty garden salad on top (never seen that before). Additionally, the toasted macadamias were a nice touch. I've always been a huge fan of the avocado rolls at BJ's, but the ones here are even better! So good. The mango mojito is also a new favorite.

C. C.,"Santa Clarita, CA",9,154,13,5.0,8/19/2015,"This review is for the catering take-out order I placed for today 8/19/2015. Not only was I impressed with the food presentation, sandwiches, salads and dessert, but I really want to focus on the customer service I received by this gem in the community Sean. Sean works the take-out counter (I think) and worked with me from beginning to end. He took my call yesterday and was professional and patient as I expressed my concern based on past experiences with other restaurants in the community. I bring lunch in for my executives often (at least twice a week) and feeding them is part of my job that I take personally. If the food or order is wrong, then it looks bad on me. Over and over again, I can not tell you how many times either something is missing (see my other reviews) or something is wrong. Not in this case... Sean walked me through the order and PERSONALLY guaranteed the order would be correct and incredible. It was. When I arrived, Sean greeted me at the door and put his hand out to shake my hand. For a 22 year old, this is IMPRESSIVE. He walked me to the take out counter and began to show me the food... some of it he noted that he prepared himself. He carefully bagged my items, making sure that I was clear on everything he labeled, and everything he promised... all along with the biggest smile on his face.  I drove away literally feeling like I had just experienced something special. What a joy I had in my heart (drama I know but I'm serious) I had knowing that SOMEWHERE, the idea of excellent service still exists, even in the mind of a millennial... no offence. But THAT'S rare! I have already reached out to the corporation via their ""contact us"" option on the website to let them know that THIS KID DESERVES A PROMOTION! Whatever he is going to do in life, he is going to be great at it. He's just one of those kids.  I will go back, again and again, as long as I keep getting this kind of service with this kind of food. Oh, and if you are thinking about using them for corporate catering... get the large sandwich combo with the two salads and the dessert platter. It's amazing and totally worth the low price!

I've passed by many times but have never stopped by. I'm glad I did. There's a lot to do in this shopping center and the location is majestic and has great views. When I stopped in with a friend, the restaurant wasn't too busy. We were greeted instantly and the hostess was very friendly. The restaurant itself was decorated in typical CPK fashion, but this location was far more beautiful inside (and outside) than the others I have visited. Our server, Jared, was great. We weren't at the table two minutes before he took our drink orders. Around five minutes later he took our food order after bringing our drinks. He was friendly as well. When I go to CPK, I like to try whatever new pizzas are on the menu. My staples (that you can never go wrong with) are the Jamaican Jerk Chicken pizza, Cheeseburger pizza, Chipotle Chicken pizza, California Club pizza, and the Thai pizza. This time, I tried the Habanero Carnitas pizza on honey wheat crust. This one was good, I'd give it a B+/A-. The pizza came out perfectly cooked and the toppings were evenly spread. The habanero salse came on the side, which hit me as weird at first but made complete sense. Unfortunately, that's where the pizza lost some points. The salsa was bland and definitely not spicy, which was disappointing. I'm a sucker for spice so luckily, my old girlfriend Cholula, came to the rescue. The carnitas were great on top, the cheese and sauce were perfect and the crust was a delicious, slightly sweet addition to the whole thing. I'm pretty satisfied.

Erik L.,"Santa Clarita, CA",101,281,421,3.0,5/4/2010,"The CPK in the Bridgeport Marketplace is gorgeous, with a killer view of the ""fake-lake"", with its ducks, wooden bridge, and metal statues of sailboats and seagulls.  The Good - The Caesar salad was very good. Tasty dressing, crunchy garlicky croutons, and huge shaved slices of Parmesan cheese. The Chicken Tequila Fettuccine pasta was also excellent. And different. I don't think I've ever seen it anywhere else. Spinach fettuccine with peppers and tequila-lime/jalapeño cream sauce. Probably the best thing on the menu. The Bad - The hostess was a joyless, indifferent 20-something that obviously understood the importance of making a good first impression. Not! And what they call bread was (as usual) cold, hard, tasteless slices of day-old cardboard with virtually non-spreadable rock hard frozen butter.  The Ugly - The ""P"" in CPK stands for Pizza, so we ordered what the waitress said was a pretty popular pizza - Thai Chicken Pizza. Unfortunately, the pizza was pretty nasty.

The food quality is typical of a chain restaurant, lots of variety, hefty servings, tons of calories, etc. I'm glad they added the small bites menu. I'll usually get a wedge salad and explore the menu and split an entree with my honey. I like my pizza a bit crispier but the thin crust feels like I'm eating a cracker and the regular pizza tastes a bit dough-ee at times. We usually opt for the pasta selections, bolognese is our favorite. Lately it seems like everyone else does too.  My biggest DISAPPOINTMENT is that they played with the menu and took off the Banana chocolate cake/torte dessert.  Another side note...I was introduced to this DELICOUS dessert when I came in for a half salad and I must have had this unsatisfied look on my face. When they put the calorie counts on the menu they couldn't put in the usual amount of salad dressing cuz of the calorie counts. And the once shrimp and crab miso salad was now just a shrimp salad for the same price...so they threw in a dessert for free.

The wait to be seated was 45 minutes to an hour, but we were lucky enough to spot two seats at the bar and snagged them right away. They have tons of employees, and for the customer load, they need it. It still took 45 minutes to get our food, but that was because the kitchen was so backed up.  Why am i giving them 5 stars, you ask? Simply because they have potential. I did not expect to get seated right away, nor did I expect to eat within the first 20 minutes of being there. This is a new chain restaurant in Santa Clarita, and patience is a virtue.  Dinner was excellent, and our server, Scott, was very nice. I had the Moroccan Chicken Salad. It was amazing. Thinly sliced Moroccan-spiced chicken breast, dates, butternut squash, beets, avocados, almonds, romaine lettuce and cranberries tossed in a champagne vinaigrette. The salad was a complex mix of flavors that really worked well together. Tami got the Goat Cheese and Roasted Pepper Pizza. I didn't try it, but it looked really good.

The asparagus & spinach spaghetti was nice and fresh. The key lime pie was a perfect ending. Heather, our server was great, she had a great personality and very welcoming.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia?start=240
Nick E.,"Valencia, CA",0,10,,1.0,1/22/2011,The price they charge for the quality & quantity of food you get is both insulting & offensive.  I'm amazed this place has been around this long.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia?start=240
Kimberly W.,"Newhall, CA",23,18,,2.0,9/6/2011,I want to start by saying my review as a 2 star is not for the quality of their food. Our food was actually very good. The 2 star is for the quality of the service. We got there on 9/5/11 at about 2pm. We asked to be seated outside. We were their for a little while when our Waiter Melvin took our order. He was pleasant however he did not come back out to fill our drinks and they turned off the misters so it got very hot outside. We ultimately went back inside and they forgot us there. Finally the chef came out with our food and they brought our salads at the exact same time as the main course. The salads should always come first. Then our Waiter finally came back and we said we have no drinks. He asked why we did not bring them in with us. My husband said because they were empty. He asked us what we were drinking and brought them out but NEVER came back to refill them. Over all the experience was poor do to the lack of service. We got out of there at 3:20...1 hour and 20 minutes after we arrived. Very hard with kids including a one year only.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia?start=240
Doug K.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,28,,4.0,8/18/2009,"Second time at this location.  The first time took about 2.5 hours since they had only been open a few days...the service was horrible and the food was cold and came out a plate at a time. The second time was up to snuff.  We went for an early dinner and completely missed the crowds.  Service was excellent and the Greek Pizza was very good (although the server should not call it ""Greece Pizza"" when delivering your food...that would be a whole other thing. I will definitely go to this location more often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia?start=240
Jay S.,"North Hollywood, CA",0,6,,1.0,4/10/2010,I have eaten at several CPK and never thought much good or bad about the food.  I ate pizza hut a few days before this/visit and I can honestly say there was little difference. The  CPK pizza I had tasted was bland and very similar to many of the $5 pizzas I have had in the past.  Chi Chis is a far better choice if you crave a good pizza.  CPK's pizza tasted like it was from the freezer section at vons.  The pizza was thouroughly dissapointing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia?start=240
Sheri F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,,5.0,5/19/2012,The food and service is always absolutely awesome tasting!  My favorites are the Spaghetti Bolognese and the Waldorf Chicken Salad!  Quality food that always taste frech!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia?start=240
Rachel S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,4,,3.0,2/25/2012,"In the beginning of my visits, the service and food was great! But the last time I went, all the kung pao spaghetti we ordered was cold and undercooked. When we called the manager over to our table, the manager came and talked to us about the spaghetti. We told him it was undercooked and cold and he asked us if we wanted another order. What kind of question is that? Obviously if something is not met to one's need, it's your job to offer a replacement. You can't ask such a question to a customer. Honestly, that one time ruined my visits and I haven't been there since, but all the other positive times make up for this one time. So, I'll go back once in a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia?start=240
Phyllis C.,"Canyon Country, CA",3,17,2,1.0,9/10/2010,"I came here with the hubby for lunch at around noon on a Sunday.  The place wasn't that crowded.  But I knew we were in trouble as soon as we walked inside.  There was no hostess at the hostess stand, and we were standing around there for a good 5 minutes before somebody approached us.  And there were servers milling around us.  Just no acknowledgement of our presence.  After we were seated, it was another 10 minutes before our server showed up to greet us.  She was friendly, alright, but the poor girl seemed very overwhelmed and overworked.  After all, we noticed that she was serving too many tables.  Clearly, this place was understaffed, and their manager was doing nothing to help out.  All he was doing was scratching off those coupon cards for other customers.  Anyway, we didn't even get our complimentary bread, and our pizzas took another 25 minutes to show up, and they were cold too.  Never been to a place with such horrible service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia?start=240
Iz B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,18,,4.0,2/16/2011,"I love the food here, but the prices are a little hard for us. You can get $50 gift cards from   for $40 which helps a little.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia?start=240
S J.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/31/2009,"We COULD NOT BELIEVE how HORRIBLE THE SERVICE WAS. We stopped for dinner, requested 3 adults and 2 high chairs. We were told it would be a 20 minute wait. 30 minutes later, we were told it would be 10 minutes more. After another 20 minutes, we were told they were wiping down the table, yet 5 minutes later, we were told that they didn't have high chairs available.  We asked to speak with the manager, Jason S. who was SO RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL and actually suggested that we sit and have our meal with our babies on our laps....Needless to say, we went elsewhere to eat, and despite it being a busy Friday evening OTHER RESTAURANTS were able to seat us right away, high chairs and all. Not sure if we will ban all CPK's but should have taken advice of others and not bothered with the one in Valencia",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia?start=240
Antoinette G.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/24/2010,"Unfortunately after much anticipation of the opening of CPK in Santa Clarita, I was very disappointed.  We stopped for lunch on a Monday afternoon (around 3:00) thinking that we would be able to enjoy a nice lunch being it was a weekday and after lunch rush and before dinner rush, WRONG!!!  First off it took some time for the hostess to actually seat us and we did we waited even longer to get any service!!!  Not even a quick I'll be with you in a minute or water to the table.  I had to ask a waitress who was attending to our table.  She told me she would get someone to help us.  Well guess what?  She was our waitress and she was doing absolutely nothing as we sat waiting for someone to attend to us.  I will never return to this establishment.  I would rather fight the crowds and parking in Burbank any time then return here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia?start=240
