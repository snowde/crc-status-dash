Aprille S.,"Raleigh, NC",129,101,76,4.0,1/1/2018,"Classic CPK, good pizza with decent service.  It's a tradition for my high school friends and I to get dinner here when we're all in town. So we all ordered drinks which were brought out promptly. I ordered their orchard sangria which was large and very sweet.  For pizza, I ordered their caramelized onion and chicken pizza which was pretty good. I'm not a crust person, but I did eat all the crust this time. Our service was decent until our waitress brought us our checks without prompting. She didn't even ask if we wanted dessert - which I did.  But i'll be back for tradition sake and good pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-virginia-beach
Jenny B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",21,93,17,3.0,9/16/2017,"Been to this CPK many times. Went for the first time in a while for lunch. Wasn't given a drink menu, my mushroom pizza (i think it's new?) didn't appear to have the extra cheese i ordered and the truffle oil you can request for it was l like 2 whole drops. And why was the waitress too lazy to walk over to our table and give us our meals instead of just placing them on the table over the partition of the booth? C'mon now! But, the buffalo cauliflower appetizer was really impressive. Vegan buffalo wings??",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-virginia-beach
Tsugumi S.,"Virginia Beach, VA",6,70,85,4.0,10/28/2017,The food was good. Our server looked like she was tired and didn't want to serve anymore so I understood why we didn't get the best service.

Lennore R.,"Virginia Beach, VA",73,179,38,3.0,3/13/2017,"I came here strictly on a dessert craving because I love the butter cake with ice cream- which is honestly enough to feed 4 if you guys are all full off of dinner & just want a few bites of something sweet. It's a bit on the pricey side, but it has always come out warm with the scoop of ice cream still holding its shape.  It took a while to place my simple order after we were seated... no hi, hello, anything really. That's what knocked it down a star because it wasn't slammed. A quick, ""I'll be right with you,"" would have sufficed.  Other than the odd wait time on a fairly chill Friday night, the server was friendly and checked in on our dessert after we received it. A+ because she turned in my card when my stupid self left it behind, lol. (I'm on this weird spree of just leaving my cards everywhere after I pay.)  Their pizzas are solid, and their drinks are delicious. I'll be back because it's the closest CPK location, and the butter cake has me hooked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-virginia-beach

Christina C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",209,215,88,3.0,5/22/2017,"i used to come here quite a bit with my coworkers to order a quick bite to eat, but lately it just isn't the same. we normally get a mushroom pizza and a thai crunch salad and they are normally super good, but lately it's been a little funny... our thai crunch salad barely had any lettuce and we paid extra for avocado and there weren't that many on there. the chicken tasted horrible -- as if it wasn't cooked all the way -- had too much of a ""bite"" and that just ruined the meal for me. the pizza however was super good! we sat by the bar for faster service and the service was fast indeed. we also got the butter cake which is a MUST get with icecream if you're there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-virginia-beach
Janice T.,"Virginia Beach, VA",70,153,2811,4.0,3/31/2017,"Honestly I haven't ate here since they were the first place to open in Town center because I was underwhelmed. Well, this was my niece's choice and I did a quick look over of gluten free options and they have quite a few. I was impressed they have gluten free certified pizzas but you have to inform them. They have a small gluten free pizza list. You can get pizzas with gluten free crust but if it's not on the gluten free pizza list there is no guarantee that the ingredients on top of the pizza are gluten free. So if you are celiac stick to the certified gluten free menu. Those items are cooked by themselves.  But overall I was impressed with how far this chain has come. Not my favorite place to eat and I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants but I wouldn't mind coming back. A gentleman came out with my pizza with the ""gluten free"" pick in the pizza assuring me it was Cooked on its own. I have a gluten sensitivity and am non celiac. But if you are celiac and highly gluten free sensitive please consult with the restaurant first to take extra measures!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-virginia-beach
Krisha B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",66,97,203,4.0,1/31/2016,"This is located right across the fountain at Town Center. You can park at the lot, or in the Armanda Hoffler garage. Both are a minute walk away.  Upon entering, there is a small host station, which no one ever seems to be at.  Great place to get thin crust pizzas. I usually come here with the boo and share a pizza and some appetizers! It's overpriced for pizza, but I'm obsessed with the Spicy Chipotle Chicken, it tastes like getting a burrito from Chipotle in pizza form! The Crispy Mac & Cheese is great too! Imagine mac and cheese with a crunchy breading on the outside. YUM! It's a bit overpriced for some pizza, if you want big portions with fluffy crust and filling toppings, go else wear. But if you're looking for a casual lunch, this is a great place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-virginia-beach
Marcus G.,"Virginia Beach, VA",337,303,417,4.0,7/28/2016,"Believe it or not this place also has salads... My coworker and I tend to frequent this place when we need some good salads instead of the usual burger and fries we go for. If you are on your lunch break, I recommend going to the bar to get things a little faster. I always go for the Chinese Chicken Salad, my friend gets the Thai Crunch. However, the last visit, I decided to switch things up, so I got a Turkey Cobb salad, which was just ok, nothing spectacular, and nothing too boring. I recommended the Thai Crunch to another co-worker of mine and she LOVED it. (It also seems like she got a good amount as compared to my plate, but that could be because the Thai Crunch has more ingredients in it).  Of course, this place has Pizza, all i can recommend is the Pear Gorgonzola if you're trying to get something different, you basic pepperoni lovers :) DON'T let your life go by without trying to butter cake, you'll thank me later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-virginia-beach

Darius M.,"Suffolk, VA",180,164,425,4.0,2/27/2017,Well this wasn't my first time attending this particular location I will say that they are very consistent in what they do... the pizza had was outstanding in addition to excellent service that I received. Yes its a chain restaurant but they do a great job and have a great selection of food. One thing that I'd also like to point out is that they do a dine to donate. A charitable organization can go to them and get 20% of the meals that are sold donated to their organization based off of the business they bring in to raise money.

Kristine D.,"Virginia Beach, VA",859,429,3842,4.0,10/26/2015,"Man! I seriously hadn't been to CPK in years!!! Over five, I'm sure! What brought me here again? The recent FILFEST event at Town Center. With the lines being ridiculously long for all the food trucks, and other restaurants being packed & such long wait times, we decided to dine here! Customer service was awesome, greeted and seated immediately. Our waitress was friendly, checked up on us regularly, and just did an awesome job altogether, no complaints here! The place - I'm sure it's your standard CPK set - up... I've only been to the one at Macarthur Mall & this location. I love how their kitchen is ""open"" and you can see everything going on back there, (the pizza tossing, baking, etc)  from where you're sitting. Very cool. The food was great too! I especially loved the Chicken Picatta that I ordered (thin chicken breast, pan fried, and served with spagettini with a lemon-butter sauce & capers. Deelish!)  My parents also had pasta dishes; I kind of wish one of them ordered pizza! Anyway, the only complaint here, which I've noticed from the other reviews as well, was their pricing. It's pretty much $15-17 a pasta dish, which is a lot, in my opinion, especially for a chain.  It tasted good though, but I just know I could get more bang for my buck elsewhere. Good chain restaurant, good chain! Good experience here! I give this place 3.75 stars! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-virginia-beach
Clarice C.,"Norfolk, VA",87,9,2,5.0,4/5/2017,"Came here one night during restaurant week. We've been wanting to try CPK for a while and you can't beat the $20 dinner deal for restaurant week. We had a great server named Jessica who was so funny. It was her first day there and you couldn't tell. She was so personable, which made for a great experience. I had the hummus appetizer - so good! The pizza is not half bad for thin crust. I don't think I would go out of my way for it especially since the bottom of the crust tasted burnt at times, but the toppings were good. Now the dessert - OMG. That's the reason why I'm giving them 5 stars. You need to get their dessert. I got the red velvet cake and it is easily one of the best red velvet cakes I've had in my life. The slice was huge!! Add some vanilla ice cream to it and you have some of the best cake I've had in my life.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-virginia-beach

It's usually clean and bright inside, has a large dining room and I like that you can watch them prepare your food from the bar or of u sit near it. Servers are quite helpful and efficient.

On Monday, I had the mac and cheese bites and garlic foccacia bread.  The mac and cheese bites were good and would do it again.  The bread was also good. For dinner I had the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pizza with avocado.  It was really good and spicier than when I've had it in the past.  I always save half so I can have the rest another day.  The pizza is just as good cold the next day.

Heidi S.,"Chesapeake, VA",177,181,129,2.0,7/1/2015,"I was really disappointed with my visit yesterday evening. This would have been a 5-star visit if the service was on point, but our server dropped the ball so many times. We were sat immediately as the restaurant was maybe 20% full. This is definitely not the place for a cozy dinner. The walls between tables are low and it hinders privacy. We sat for nearly 10 minutes before our server (admittedly new) took our drink orders. I asked what local drafts were on tap and he didn't know.. ""because he's new."" Write that crap down! Then he sort of looked at me as if I shouldn't expect an answer or for him to find out. When I didn't end up ordering from the local list, he responded with ""you made me do all that work and you aren't even ordering one?!"" I'm sorry, but that's not funny, funny guy. I ordered a WELL vodka and soda. This bit me in the ass later. Apparently their well vodka is Absolut. Who puts Absolut in the well?! My well drink cost $9. Ridiculous. His up-sell attempts started from the get go. Buy alcohol, buy top shelf, add truffle oil, you know you want that strawberry shortcake. Your tip isn't getting bigger with this tactic. It's just pissing me off. Please just give me what I ask for! The food was good - Sicilian pizza, Pepperoni pizza, Thai crunch and Chinese chicken salads were enjoyable. We also ordered the white corn guacamole, but it looked nothing like the photo. It was good, but not great. I liked the food, but I really, really disliked the service. I'm not sure I'd return without a request from friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-virginia-beach?start=40
Olivia L.,"Norfolk, VA",0,7,1,2.0,3/5/2017,"2 stars because of the service. My husband and I ate here this weekend, because we really wanted a flatbread. Right off the bat, we ordered a flatbread. The waitress then took our drink orders a few minutes later. Several minutes after that she came to say they were out of flatbreads. I expressed my disappointment because I really came just for that, but we went ahead and substituted with the avocado rolls. Shortly after that, she took our order and I ordered a pizza. Several minutes later she came back to say they were out of that too. I had to get the menu back and figure out, again, what I wanted, which delayed my husbands food from coming out on time. I understand restaurants run out of things, but their staff should be informed. After all of this I expected for the app to be taken off the bill or the manager to come by, but nothing.

Mia L.,"Norfolk, VA",0,21,,3.0,8/12/2016,The area is really nice. We were seated outside so the view was perfect. The service was average. Don't expect a warm welcome or service. The hostess and the servers are not very inviting. I know tip is big part of how waitresses generate money; however costumer is not obligated to give either. When you tip you don't get thank you or just a crack of smile. The girl looked at me like yea you better tip kind of look. I didn't mind the slow service since it was a beautiful day but I'm sure if someone is in a hurry CPK won't be their top choice. I ordered California club without bacon and the highlight of the night was that. The pizza was delicious. The cheese pizza kind of reminded me of Italy ; it's not identical but it is something close.

Shari G.,"Norfolk, VA",98,19,3,3.0,6/23/2015,"I'm vegan and was a little unsure about going in for lunch because I wasn't sure what they'd have for me to eat, but was pleasantly surprised. All the salads and most (if not all) pastas and pizzas can be easily modified to accommodate a vegan diet. (Vegetarians, y'all don't have anything to worry about!) I was really lucky though because we had an awesome waitress (Shout out to Cyndy! You rocked!) who was very knowledgeable and took all the stress out of ordering. I ended up having the quinoa and arugula salad (without feta) and enjoyed it, but it could have been a little more flavorful. My dining companions had the California veggie pizza, the California Fields Salad, and fettuccine alfredo and had good things to say about all of them. (Being vegan, I couldn't eat them myself but they looked lovely and the pizza smelled delicious!) As for the rest of the experience: we were seated right away, the staff were all very friendly, the restaurant was clean, and the food came out promptly and with no issues.

I hadn't eaten at CPK in about 4 or 5 years, so I was glad to see my favorite dish was still on the menu- the chicken tequila fettuccine. I stopped in around 6:15 pm on a Tuesday evening and sat at the bar- the first thing I noticed was that quite a few servers were flitting about the kitchen area and did not have their hair up and had long swinging ponytails. I find that to be unsanitary personally. I overheard the bartender telling her regulars that she was quitting in a few days so I think she just didn't have her heart in the service anymore. She was nice but was not detail oriented. I ordered a salad with no tomatoes and it came with tomatoes and it had to be remade which caused it to come out right before I got my entree. Also when I got the salad she did not give me any silverware and also did not offer me any bread. I had a Moscow mule and it was made with Agave sour mix instead of lime Juice which made it sweeter then I cared for. The fettuccine was still good.

Ordering online was easy until 30 minutes later we got a call saying that our order was canceled with no given reason.

Just some statements about how hard it was to cook. Yea it is really hard when your cooks don't pay attention. Also noticed not clean under the bar chairs crumbs and the door on the men's room all scratched up, just poor maintenance.

Called and they marked me down for a pickup even though I spoke to two different people before my order was taken and I told them all it was for delivery.

The server placed our drink orders  and everyone placed their food orders also.  The personal size pizza pies everyone ordered looked and smelled delicious.  I watched as the cooks were making them and put the pizza in the old school oven where I can actually look inside.  I thought that was pretty neat.

I ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza and they had it out in like 15 minutes. It was delicious and filling and after two slices I asked for a box and boogied out of there.  No complaints-serve was good and food is as you would expect from a chain restaurant. No super ""wow"" or creativity of local joints-just a good pizza.

I got the Alfredo and my husband got the California Club pizza. Really I was surprised at how well they did the Alfredo, because as simple as it is, I know very few places that master it. My husband's pizza was more like a salad, but that was awesome... He really loved the combinations, even though he said he felt like a rabbit eating that whole thing.  We also got the free small plate of biano bread, which really was great as well. I'm a big fan of combined cheeses, and the depth of flavor on this small thing was amazing.  Really though, the prices are what got me! I just didn't expect it to be such an expensive meal, especially coming from a chain with personal sized pizzas.

Ronnita W.,"Miami, FL",72,70,128,3.0,9/18/2016,"First time here yesterday while visiting Norfolk. The service after being seated was very slow to start. When we asked for service we were told ""let me see who has your table"". When the server (Jasmine) came and asked how we were doing I replied with a chuckle ""ummmm hungry"". The server asked (like she was the one waiting 20 minutes to order) ""is there a problem"". I replied ""we have been waiting for someone to take our order for a while"". As per our server no one told her they sat someone in her section...and she had to nerve to have a little bite of attitude while explaining that to us, ""well when people sit people in your section without telling you this happens"". I finally broke from tending to my children and made silent eye contact with her...she then stated ""hopefully I can, I will make the rest of your time here to your enjoyment"". She took our orders & was helpful. She then apologized for the wait and said she would go talk to them inside about the delay also. She was very attentive throughout the service. The food was ok. The Margherita pizza was good I've had better. The 5 cheese pizza was not my cup of tea but my 3 yr old son loved it and ate 3 slices. Slices, as our server warned us, were small (average). The oil for the ore meal bread has a slight kick (I believe from red peppers) but it was good. The drinks (Moscow mule & margarita) were really good the first round, the second round they were lighter and lacked the kick/ bite of the first two.

Our 5 year old ordered the cheese pizza off of the kids menu and declared it the best pizza ever.  Our 2 year old got the mac and cheese with edamame.  It was a huge serving and absolutely delicious.  Our service was good, too.  The only issue was had was that she asked if my husband wanted a refill towards the end of our meal and then never brought one. I do agree with Steven that it would be nice if they offered smaller pizzas for lunch.  It would also be nice if they offered smaller pizzas just for the sake of variety at the table.

We went for the ""splitting"" option because we were just having lunch and did not want to stuff ourselves.  But to our dismay this place does not have a dedicated lunch menu.  They do have soups, salads and sandwiches but I don't think it is out of bounds to come to a pizza restaurant and expect smaller size pizzas to be available for the lunch crowd.  Who wants to pay $11-$14 per pizza for lunch?  That is reasonable for dinner but do you really want to pay over $30 for a two person lunch?  I guess that explains why the place was practically empty.

Well, first off, usually, I'm not a chain restaurant fan, but since moving out here, it seems that is the choice. Anyways, there has been a CPK in every city we have lived in, but never tried one and after being quoted an hour and twenty minutes for the two of us at the Chinese place around the corner, we popped in here and got seats at  the bar right away. Renee looked after us and the service was stellar. Actually, all the staff were super friendly...no obviously disgruntled employees, and in an open kitchen, you usually spot at least one ;) Anyways, we were both impressed with the menu selection. There were enough light, fresh selections for me, and hearty, cheesy, meaty selections for the man. The arugula and asparagus salad I had as a starter was perfect, and he polished off his jerk chicken pizza...no box needed there. I saw a few of the ""non-pizza"" dishes go out, and the chile relleno looked amazing, plus they got us to sign up for some loyalty club so we get a couple of $5 off coupons for next time. Anyways, for a chain, a damn good one. Seriously quality ingredients seemed to be used...goat cheese, shaved parmasean...which on a mass scale is usually rare...think about Chili's...ick. I suppose the chain does help the prices on the product though, since it was very reasonable. My salad was around $5, and the pizzas were around $12, which you could probably share if you weren't married to a Marine (meaning we got two). AND, genuinely nice people at the bar too.

Shiela E.,"Virginia Beach, VA",286,108,75,3.0,12/11/2013,"As far as food go, I feel like California Pizza Kitchen is mediocre. I only come here if we get a gift card! I do feel like there are plenty of places in the area that offer better tasting pizza, but I've also had worse. The only appetizer I've tried are the lettuce wraps, which I thought were decent. My family also ordered the avocado club egg rolls. I wasn't able to try it since I'm allergic to avocado, but they said it was pretty good. My favorite pizza at CPK is the Sicilian pizza! It has a kick, but I'm able to handle it (not too fond of spicy food).  It consists of Spicy marinara, Italian sausage, spicy Capicola ham, salami, Mozzarella, shaved Parmesan, basil and oregano. If you're looking for a non-traditional pizza, I would suggest the Thai chicken pizza. My boyfriend ordered it one time, and he liked it!  I've also had a couple of their pastas, which I actually enjoyed. I ordered the asparagus + spinach spaghettini and the spaghetti bolognese. Unless I'm craving pizza, I think I'm going to stick with the pastas from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-virginia-beach?start=60

I got the white pizza, which is usually a favorite of mine but this one at CPK, as the cool kids are calling it, was average at best. The crust was bland, the sauce thin and wimpy & the cheese wasn't proportioned right. Also, the size of the pizza was very small.(its def. a one person pizza)  I've had better much better white pizza at Y-Not pizza or heck, Dominos.   The others in our group ordered non-pizza meals and those looked good, probably a better choice for me next time.

Among  our group of four we had a 'Jamaican Jerk Chicken' and 'The Works' ordered by the two Veterans, an Italian Deli sandwich ordered by a friend and I ordered the 'Spicy Chipotle Chicken' pizza with an extra side of the fresh Lime Crema. The Spicy Chipotle Chicken was by far the table favorite, it came with an amazing roasted corn salsa on top & the lime crema was fantastic.  The Works pizza was what I imagine a Meat-atarian would order, just covered in animals & smelled of heart burn, but I'm sure it was delicious.  The Jamaican Jerk Chicken was interesting, but I still preferred the Spicy Chipotle.  Our drinks were always being filled & it was truly enjoyable. I was very impressed that nothing went wrong considering that two of the four people being served did so for free.

Dan W.,"Astoria, NY",12,200,207,4.0,9/6/2010,"California Pizza Kitchen is a chain pizza place that attempts to deliver the West Coast pizza experience all across the country. Perhaps this is executed correctly, but the menu extends well beyond this scope to provide fairly decent dining. The pizzas are somewhat unique in that they extend well beyond traditional Italian pizza fare. For instance, some of the pizzas include: Cheeseburger Pizza (done well, actually), BBQ Chicken, Pear & Gorgonzola (not a fan--don't fruit the pizza, please!), Carne Asada (good), Jamaican Jerk Chicken (okay), Thai Chicken (gross), and an awesome White Pizza with applewood smoked bacon (definitely worth checking out). There are other interesting items on the menu as well such as Korean BBQ tacos and Spicy Chicken Tinga Quesadillas. This definitely adds to your options, but Pizza is certainly King here.  The staff is very knowledgeable about the menu, which is very helpful in figuring out what to order; the menu can be a bit overwhelming. Also, you can choose to sit inside, but there is a great patio section outside the restaurant that has a great view of the town center fountain. On cooler days, this is a great place to sit with a friend, order a pizza, and have a few beers. The price point is decent, but the great service and the interesting and unusual food make this place--despite being a chain--worth going to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-virginia-beach?start=60

We also got the free small plate of biano bread, which really was great as well. I'm a big fan of combined cheeses, and the depth of flavor on this small thing was amazing.

The server asked (like she was the one waiting 20 minutes to order) ""is there a problem"". I replied ""we have been waiting for someone to take our order for a while"". As per our server no one told her they sat someone in her section...and she had to nerve to have a little bite of attitude while explaining that to us, ""well when people sit people in your section without telling you this happens"".

The Margherita pizza was good I've had better. The 5 cheese pizza was not my cup of tea but my 3 yr old son loved it and ate 3 slices. Slices, as our server warned us, were small (average).

Janice T.,"Virginia Beach, United States",70,153,2811,4.0,31/3/2017,"Honestly I haven't ate here since they were the first place to open in Town center because I was underwhelmed. Well, this was my niece's choice and I did a quick look over of gluten free options and they have quite a few. I was impressed they have gluten free certified pizzas but you have to inform them. They have a small gluten free pizza list. You can get pizzas with gluten free crust but if it's not on the gluten free pizza list there is no guarantee that the ingredients on top of the pizza are gluten free. So if you are celiac stick to the certified gluten free menu. Those items are cooked by themselves.  But overall I was impressed with how far this chain has come. Not my favorite place to eat and I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants but I wouldn't mind coming back. A gentleman came out with my pizza with the ""gluten free"" pick in the pizza assuring me it was Cooked on its own. I have a gluten sensitivity and am non celiac. But if you are celiac and highly gluten free sensitive please consult with the restaurant first to take extra measures!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-virginia-beach

Both are a minute walk away.  Upon entering, there is a small host station, which no one ever seems to be at.  Great place to get thin crust pizzas. I usually come here with the boo and share a pizza and some appetizers! It's overpriced for pizza, but I'm obsessed with the Spicy Chipotle Chicken, it tastes like getting a burrito from Chipotle in pizza form! The Crispy Mac & Cheese is great too! Imagine mac and cheese with a crunchy breading on the outside. YUM! It's a bit overpriced for some pizza, if you want big portions with fluffy crust and filling toppings, go else wear.

If you are on your lunch break, I recommend going to the bar to get things a little faster. I always go for the Chinese Chicken Salad, my friend gets the Thai Crunch. However, the last visit, I decided to switch things up, so I got a Turkey Cobb salad, which was just ok, nothing spectacular, and nothing too boring. I recommended the Thai Crunch to another co-worker of mine and she LOVED it. (It also seems like she got a good amount as compared to my plate, but that could be because the Thai Crunch has more ingredients in it).

Yes its a chain restaurant but they do a great job and have a great selection of food. One thing that I'd also like to point out is that they do a dine to donate.

The recent FILFEST event at Town Center. With the lines being ridiculously long for all the food trucks, and other restaurants being packed & such long wait times, we decided to dine here! Customer service was awesome, greeted and seated immediately. Our waitress was friendly, checked up on us regularly, and just did an awesome job altogether, no complaints here! The place - I'm sure it's your standard CPK set - up... I've only been to the one at Macarthur Mall & this location. I love how their kitchen is ""open"" and you can see everything going on back there, (the pizza tossing, baking, etc)  from where you're sitting. Very cool. The food was great too! I especially loved the Chicken Picatta that I ordered (thin chicken breast, pan fried, and served with spagettini with a lemon-butter sauce & capers. Deelish!)  My parents also had pasta dishes; I kind of wish one of them ordered pizza! Anyway, the only complaint here, which I've noticed from the other reviews as well, was their pricing. It's pretty much $15-17 a pasta dish, which is a lot, in my opinion, especially for a chain.  It tasted good though, but I just know I could get more bang for my buck elsewhere.

It was her first day there and you couldn't tell. She was so personable, which made for a great experience. I had the hummus appetizer - so good! The pizza is not half bad for thin crust. I don't think I would go out of my way for it especially since the bottom of the crust tasted burnt at times, but the toppings were good. Now the dessert - OMG. That's the reason why I'm giving them 5 stars. You need to get their dessert. I got the red velvet cake and it is easily one of the best red velvet cakes I've had in my life. The slice was huge!!

This would have been a 5-star visit if the service was on point, but our server dropped the ball so many times. We were sat immediately as the restaurant was maybe 20% full. This is definitely not the place for a cozy dinner. The walls between tables are low and it hinders privacy. We sat for nearly 10 minutes before our server (admittedly new) took our drink orders. I asked what local drafts were on tap and he didn't know.. ""because he's new."" Write that crap down! Then he sort of looked at me as if I shouldn't expect an answer or for him to find out. When I didn't end up ordering from the local list, he responded with ""you made me do all that work and you aren't even ordering one?!"" I'm sorry, but that's not funny, funny guy. I ordered a WELL vodka and soda. This bit me in the ass later. Apparently their well vodka is Absolut. Who puts Absolut in the well?! My well drink cost $9. Ridiculous. His up-sell attempts started from the get go. Buy alcohol, buy top shelf, add truffle oil, you know you want that strawberry shortcake. Your tip isn't getting bigger with this tactic. It's just pissing me off. Please just give me what I ask for! The food was good - Sicilian pizza, Pepperoni pizza, Thai crunch and Chinese chicken salads were enjoyable.

I expressed my disappointment because I really came just for that, but we went ahead and substituted with the avocado rolls. Shortly after that, she took our order and I ordered a pizza. Several minutes later she came back to say they were out of that too. I had to get the menu back and figure out, again, what I wanted, which delayed my husbands food from coming out on time.

I was really lucky though because we had an awesome waitress (Shout out to Cyndy! You rocked!) who was very knowledgeable and took all the stress out of ordering.

I stopped in around 6:15 pm on a Tuesday evening and sat at the bar- the first thing I noticed was that quite a few servers were flitting about the kitchen area and did not have their hair up and had long swinging ponytails. I find that to be unsanitary personally. I overheard the bartender telling her regulars that she was quitting in a few days so I think she just didn't have her heart in the service anymore. She was nice but was not detail oriented. I ordered a salad with no tomatoes and it came with tomatoes and it had to be remade which caused it to come out right before I got my entree. Also when I got the salad she did not give me any silverware and also did not offer me any bread.

Only stipulation is they don't let you create your own pizza without running up a bill of 25 dollars for a 9inch pizza.

Lauren N.,"Virginia Beach, United States",34,114,2,3.0,17/2/2013,"Went here recently & I enjoyed the atmosphere & service ,but the pizza I had was sub-par.  I got the white pizza, which is usually a favorite of mine but this one at CPK, as the cool kids are calling it, was average at best. The crust was bland, the sauce thin and wimpy & the cheese wasn't proportioned right. Also, the size of the pizza was very small.(its def. a one person pizza)  I've had better much better white pizza at Y-Not pizza or heck, Dominos.   The others in our group ordered non-pizza meals and those looked good, probably a better choice for me next time. So, for this experience I give CPK 3 stars...perhaps itll change next visit.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-virginia-beach?start=60
Jacqui R.,"Norfolk, United States",68,446,477,4.0,18/7/2010,"I actually like the atmosphere of this California Pizza Kitchen more than the one that is in MacArthur Mall. For this reason this one just seems a bit more cozy to me and I really like the set up. It is so incredibly clean inside for one thing, and the servers are very attentive. The hostess was also very kind the last time I was in and even allowed us to change seating to the outside patio after we had already sat down inside.  This location is right in the center of the Virginia Beach Town Center, so if you can grab a seat outside it is a great place to relax, have a drink and watch the street traffic. I love anywhere that I can sit and people-watch. The food is good, has the same options as the location in Norfolk, and is decently priced for what you get.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-virginia-beach?start=60
Tiffany S.,"Bowie, United States",124,235,218,5.0,25/11/2012,"We actually came here for Veteran's Day, so my husband and best friend both received free pizzas & CPK was extremely busy. It was, however, extremely delicious all around and our service was great.  Among  our group of four we had a 'Jamaican Jerk Chicken' and 'The Works' ordered by the two Veterans, an Italian Deli sandwich ordered by a friend and I ordered the 'Spicy Chipotle Chicken' pizza with an extra side of the fresh Lime Crema. The Spicy Chipotle Chicken was by far the table favorite, it came with an amazing roasted corn salsa on top & the lime crema was fantastic.  The Works pizza was what I imagine a Meat-atarian would order, just covered in animals & smelled of heart burn, but I'm sure it was delicious.  The Jamaican Jerk Chicken was interesting, but I still preferred the Spicy Chipotle.  Our drinks were always being filled & it was truly enjoyable. I was very impressed that nothing went wrong considering that two of the four people being served did so for free. It was very kind of CPK to provide free meals to Veterans & Active Duty.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-virginia-beach?start=60
Dan W.,"Astoria, United States",12,200,207,4.0,6/9/2010,"California Pizza Kitchen is a chain pizza place that attempts to deliver the West Coast pizza experience all across the country. Perhaps this is executed correctly, but the menu extends well beyond this scope to provide fairly decent dining. The pizzas are somewhat unique in that they extend well beyond traditional Italian pizza fare. For instance, some of the pizzas include: Cheeseburger Pizza (done well, actually), BBQ Chicken, Pear & Gorgonzola (not a fan--don't fruit the pizza, please!), Carne Asada (good), Jamaican Jerk Chicken (okay), Thai Chicken (gross), and an awesome White Pizza with applewood smoked bacon (definitely worth checking out). There are other interesting items on the menu as well such as Korean BBQ tacos and Spicy Chicken Tinga Quesadillas. This definitely adds to your options, but Pizza is certainly King here.  The staff is very knowledgeable about the menu, which is very helpful in figuring out what to order; the menu can be a bit overwhelming. Also, you can choose to sit inside, but there is a great patio section outside the restaurant that has a great view of the town center fountain. On cooler days, this is a great place to sit with a friend, order a pizza, and have a few beers. The price point is decent, but the great service and the interesting and unusual food make this place--despite being a chain--worth going to.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-virginia-beach?start=60
Page W.,"Virginia Beach, United States",0,3,1,2.0,19/5/2016,"Our experience was sub standard. It was not crowded for 7pm dinner. We had a scatter brained waitress who kept spilling the drinks all over table , that is when she remembered to deliver them. No offer to clean up her own mess. Another runner brought drink to table did same thing. Everyone had a smile on face but a bizarre experience. Meanwhile another employee was breaking glass behind bar area. I always get the Thai chicken pizza- it was dry very little sauce and barely 3 small bites of chicken on entire pizza. My husband got the Sicilian pizza- just ok.. I took 3/4 pizza home because it just wasn't good and asked for extra sauce. She brought condiment cup that had 1/4 cup full- really??  I don't blame her for bad food but when I told her it was too dry and asked for sauce you would think I would get a condiment cup full!

Allison L.,"Virginia Beach, United States",52,140,108,4.0,10/5/2012,"We really like CPK.  We've been to this location a few times, the latest being today for lunch.  Today was a good experience.  We almost always get the Jamaican Jerk Chicken pizza, and today we also tried the Meat Cravers pizza.  The Jamaican Jerk was great, as usual, and the Meat Cravers was good, too.  It wasn't as exciting as some of the other offerings on the menu.  I wish we had gotten the Greek instead. Our 5 year old ordered the cheese pizza off of the kids menu and declared it the best pizza ever.  Our 2 year old got the mac and cheese with edamame.  It was a huge serving and absolutely delicious.  Our service was good, too.  The only issue was had was that she asked if my husband wanted a refill towards the end of our meal and then never brought one. I do agree with Steven that it would be nice if they offered smaller pizzas for lunch.  It would also be nice if they offered smaller pizzas just for the sake of variety at the table. Overall, CPK has a lot to offer on their menu, not just pizza.  We always opt for pizza, however, and enjoy the unique options they offer.  I know we'll be back.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-virginia-beach?start=80

Overall  I do like the service but the last time I was their the waitress and the host/greeter person were very rude. The host/greeter person did not even look at us when we(my sister and I) came in and asked if we wanted a table for three(?!?). The waitress at one point came to refill my water and spilled a lot of water over the table then walked off to another table to take their order. We had a coupon from online from their site for signing up for their emails and my sisters coupon they gave her for a free meal from Veteran's Day(since she is military). We explained very clearly to our waitress how to divide the check and she came and went back to us three times before getting it right( and even said that she had to talk the to the manager....) It was a very frustrating experience.

Erin T.,"Stuttgart, Germany",6,120,1,3.0,1/10/2013,"Not near as good as the one in Norfolk at MacArthur.  Our biggest problem was the ambiance itself- way too bright, felt like a pancake house, etc.  Service was slow, but our waiter was at least friendly.  Food was decent- one pizza's crust was burnt to the point it couldn't be eaten.  Also, one person in our party has a severe peanut allergy and ended up with a mild reaction after eating her salad that was NOT supposed to have peanuts.  Obviously, there's some cross-contamination happening in the kitchen.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-virginia-beach?start=80

Steven A.,"Virginia Beach, United States",180,417,47,3.0,15/8/2010,"We tried this place for lunch yesterday.  The Korean BBQ tacos were quite good and were just enough for two people to split as a starter.  We then split the Chipotle Chicken pizza.  It was also quite good.  I really liked the fresh black bean salsa that came on top of the pizza.  No complaints in the food quality department. We went for the ""splitting"" option because we were just having lunch and did not want to stuff ourselves.  But to our dismay this place does not have a dedicated lunch menu.  They do have soups, salads and sandwiches but I don't think it is out of bounds to come to a pizza restaurant and expect smaller size pizzas to be available for the lunch crowd.  Who wants to pay $11-$14 per pizza for lunch?  That is reasonable for dinner but do you really want to pay over $30 for a two person lunch?  I guess that explains why the place was practically empty. If you don't want to do lunch then don't open for lunch.  This ain't rocket science, folks.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-virginia-beach?start=80

Given that I'm not very daring when it comes to trying new dishes, I must applaud California Pizza Kitchen for making barbeque chicken pizza smell so damn good that I just had to have a slice.  And the verdict?  Pretty damn good!  I'm working up the nerve to try a pineapple and bacon pizza next.  I know, I know.  Baby steps.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-virginia-beach?start=80

Julie G.,"Oceanside, United States",16,46,,5.0,16/12/2012,"I can't believe I am giving some chain pizza place 5 stars, but here it goes... Well, first off, usually, I'm not a chain restaurant fan, but since moving out here, it seems that is the choice. Anyways, there has been a CPK in every city we have lived in, but never tried one and after being quoted an hour and twenty minutes for the two of us at the Chinese place around the corner, we popped in here and got seats at  the bar right away. Renee looked after us and the service was stellar. Actually, all the staff were super friendly...no obviously disgruntled employees, and in an open kitchen, you usually spot at least one ;) Anyways, we were both impressed with the menu selection. There were enough light, fresh selections for me, and hearty, cheesy, meaty selections for the man. The arugula and asparagus salad I had as a starter was perfect, and he polished off his jerk chicken pizza...no box needed there. I saw a few of the ""non-pizza"" dishes go out, and the chile relleno looked amazing, plus they got us to sign up for some loyalty club so we get a couple of $5 off coupons for next time. Anyways, for a chain, a damn good one. Seriously quality ingredients seemed to be used...goat cheese, shaved parmasean...which on a mass scale is usually rare...think about Chili's...ick. I suppose the chain does help the prices on the product though, since it was very reasonable. My salad was around $5, and the pizzas were around $12, which you could probably share if you weren't married to a Marine (meaning we got two). AND, genuinely nice people at the bar too. Okay, that is not about the restaurant itself, but it is about the experience, so why not include it?
