Parinita B.,"Warrenville, IL",4,19,,5.0,11/12/2017,Had a great dinner here. We're vegetarian and loved that we had so many options. The waitress was very helpful and suggested a Mexican pizza (forgot name) replacing the chicken with avocado and it was surprisingly very flavourful! Also shared a garlic Alfred fettuccine and Buffalo cauliflower. Both were delicious. The cauliflower was nice and spicy. Tasted a bit like  cauliflower Manchurian (Indo Chinese dish). Overall great experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-warrenville
D K.,"Woodridge, IL",0,25,,1.0,11/11/2017,"Deserved zero stars.  Went on Veterans Day (bad decision, when the food is free you get what you pay for) at 9:15, 45 min before closing.  We were seated right away. However, we were seated next to a pile of dirty dishes which sat until the food came.  All the staff was busy cleaning up elsewhere so we waited almost 10min for someone to take our order.  We ordered as soon as she came - two pizzas and 2 waters. After another 10 minutes I went to the bar to get the water since they were all busy cleaning.  One of the kitchen staff had to get the bartender's attention since he was busy cleaning the bar (it's about 9:35 at this point, 25 min before closing) The pizzas come about 5 min later.  The wife's looks good, nicely browned, bubbled crust.  Mine was shoved in the oven and not touched: one side brown with a burn bubble and the other flat and raw looking: think ""freezer pizza"" Of course she goes back to cleaning because, why waste time with customers, especially since they aren't paying?  I took a couple of bites of one piece and left the rest.  When she came back she offered to make another one - I had been there over half an hour at that point and it was within 15 minutes of closing so I declined. I go to the one at Oakbrook Mall and it's usually good.  I would never set foot in this CPK again.  If they are going to offer Veterans Day specials they should at least treat the customers with the minimum respect they would give anyone else, otherwise don't offer them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-warrenville
Karen W.,"St. Charles, IL",9,12,,2.0,11/30/2017,"I have been going toCalifornia Pizza Kitchens for a long time.  I went to lunch with my daughter and a friend of ours.  We were very disappointed with the food as it has gone downhill in taste and quality.  But we were SHOCKED at how expensive the food has become.  I had a full Cobb salad and my daughter had the BLT pizza. It was dry and boring.  My salad was just shy of $16.00 and her pizza around $15.00!  We both also had ice tea.  The bill came to $40.00 with tax and with tip close to $50.00!!! . Holy cow.  $50.00 for two ice teas, pizza and a salad.  They must not be doing well to charge that much for mediocre food ;(.   I also must give credit to a really nice and efficient waitress that made dining there a semi pleasant experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-warrenville
Rupa N.,"Chicago, IL",4,31,5,1.0,1/22/2017,"This used to be a great place to have a casual meal.  For year's we've always shared the original bbq chicken chopped salad and then had a specialty pizza The ambiance is still good as is service.  The food quality however has severely deteriorated and prices have risen The chicken chopped salad was mostly a pile of lettuce with minimal dressing and we paid near $20 for this.  I had to ask someone to bring us a cup of dressing so the ""lettuce"" could be edible We shared the Hawaiian pizza which had was lacking in cheese and any flavor whatsoever Certainly a shame because this restaurant used to be so much better.  Raising prices and worsening the food quality certainly seems like the wrong direction for CPK",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-warrenville
Alex W.,"Wheaton, IL",11,61,5,1.0,8/4/2017,"This place is a joke.  1. They are way overpriced for what you get 2. Their food is laughable at best.  3. They can't get large orders right. TAKE NOTE CPK: If I'm to pay $15 for a Wild Mushroom pizza, INCLUDE A LOT OF MUSHROOMS!! Don't give me this paper thin pizza with a quarter cup of cheese and an 1/8 cup of mushrooms. Pathetic and shame on you!! I gave you another chance and the second time I tried a grilled veggie sandwich.  TAKE NOTE CPK: If I'm to pay $15 for a grilled veggie sandwich and mediterranean sandwich, INCLUDE A LOT OF GRILLED VEGGIES!! Don't take two slivers of NOT GRILLED yellow pepper and a half of a NOT GRILLED mushroom and top it with a half pound of lettuce.   Wow CPK, can you chince your customers anymore? Do you need donations to help sustain your business?How about if I give you $20 for a grilled sandwich? Think maybe you guys could give me at least a half of a yellow bell pepper and a full mushroom and actually grill them this time?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-warrenville
Graham S.,"Joliet, IL",90,42,,1.0,11/10/2016,There is one good server here Eddie is great I wish he could be my server every time I come here.

Beth R.,"Naperville, IL",0,11,3,1.0,11/8/2016,"I placed an order online for two pizzas and chose to pick them up with the ""curbside"" option. The order went through and I got an email a few seconds later confirming my order and saying the pizzas would be ready in 20 minutes. I live about 15-20 minutes away from this location, so I got in the car and drove over to make sure I showed up in time. Upon arrival, I called into the restaurant as I was instructed to do from my confirmation email. I told the employee who answered the phone that I was waiting in one of the Curbside Pick-Up parking spots outside. She said someone would be out promptly. Twenty minutes later, no food, so I call back in and the same employee answered the phone and said someone ""would be out promptly."" Another employee came out a few seconds later and confirmed my order. I asked her what took so long and she said the employee who answered the phone ""got busy and forgot."" Nice excuse. Pretty sure I can't use that at my job. She went to get the pizzas, came back out to my car and her exact words were,""Well......that doesn't look like how they USUALLY make it!"" and this was in reference to the spicy chipotle chicken pizza I had ordered. At this point, I'm annoyed that I've waited 20 minutes, and one of my pizzas isn't ""how they usually make it."" So, I asked the employee if I can just have my money back. She avoided the question and said she was going to run inside and get the sauce for my pizza. Umm..excuse me? The pizza doesn't even have the right SAUCE on it? Okay...  She comes back out with the sauce and I go home. With the chicken pizza, I specifically ordered it to come without poblano peppers. With the first bite, I noticed they were on there.... For $30+ for two pizzas, I could have definitely had a better meal somewhere else with far better service and less hassle. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-warrenville
Kelley P.,"Romeoville, IL",2,2,,2.0,5/28/2017,"Food was fine but the server spilled three full drinks all over two of our dining party and although he apologized, management did not come over to see how we were. When a manager did come over, it was so long into the meal that their clothing was almost dry (they don't have hand dryers in the bathroom so they had to air dry in the restaurant) and he didn't mention the incident or apologize at all just the normal how are you drive by.

Mistakes were made with our order, and, worst of all, the pizzas were cold! The restaurant was not busy, but our waitress was nowhere to be seen.

Amy R.,"Naperville, IL",203,402,312,2.0,12/16/2015,"So I had a really horrible experience here last night but I've had perfectly fine experiences in the past, but never exceptional experiences, so I think two stars is where CPK lands in my book. My husband I were starving and he felt like CPK, a place I would frequent in junior high when cruising Oakbrook mall with my besties. The one out here on Diehl is well positioned across the street from the world's BEST Target, and in front of an enormous movie theater. The interior is bright and nice and the service is fine, but last night, we wanted takeout. CPK has online ordering (YES!) and curbside pickup (HELL YES!) and we scanned the menu with glee to pick out our choices. I noticed that a LOT of the menu items had truffle oil on them(I'm severely allergic to truffles), but the pizza we chose did not, so I didn't think twice about it and moved on.  We picked up our food and a delightful young lady brought it out to us promptly. Upon arriving home, we saw we were missing our appetizer. Annoying, but they credited our bill and still let my husband go pick it up, so forgivable. I had a slice of pizza and it was delicious. Then I went for a second slice and smelled... Truffle oil. Oh god, I thought. Is it on every slice? It's not supposed to be on this pizza at all! I put the slice back down and waited. Terrified. An hour later, fears confirmed: I was sicker than sick. I'm fine now, but yikes. Don't sneak weird ingredients that can make people barf on to pizza, please. In conclusion, I won't be going back to CPK, but you probably should. Unless you're allergic to items that shouldn't be on the pizza. Ugh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-warrenville

The other night they were late in getting my food ready (15 minutes past the expected ready time). The staff was very apologetic as they were clearly slammed and had mistakenly given an aggressive ready time. I was only 5 minutes into driving home after getting the food when I received a call from the staff informing me they had comped my meal because we waited so long.

Frank L.,"Chicago, IL",58,117,5,3.0,10/5/2009,"Why am I writing a review for CPK? Just so you have an idea next time you check out the California Pizza Kitchen: We started our meal with the LETTUCE WRAPS - what a great little appetizer. Four lettuce leaf/shell's, and a diced chicken filling.Perfect for the four person party we were dining with. I always get pizza. BBQ chicken never fails. A great tasting non-traditional pizza. The crust and dough is really soft, which goes well with non-traditional pizza flavor. My girlfriend got the Broccoli Rabe, Sun-dried Tomato fusilli. She loves this dish for the simplicity and taste. Our friends go Jambalaya (blackened shrimp and grilled chicken tossed with noodles!), and the Thai Crunch Salad (it looks so tasty with all of the crispy wonton strips). We didn't get dessert this time - but last time we got a slice of the Red-Velvet cake and it was really fabulous. Sounds crazy, that CPK would have such good red-velvet cake, but it was perfect. The one drawback about this trip was the number of children eating at 9pm on a Saturday night. This speaks more about the clientele than the restaurant, but just to let yo know who you could be eating with. Who goes to CPK? Folks looking for a solid meal. There is almost something for everyone (the only things missing are like steaks and chops). Prices are reasonable and the waits usually aren't that bad. Who doesn't go to CPK? People who want a more intimate dining experience (i.e. no kids shouting at 9pm) People who want high-class dining. CPK is fancy pizza, not fancy food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-warrenville?start=60

We ate the pizza here and of course it was good.  I did NOT like the appetizer prices.  $9 for spinach artichoke dip!  It was not a hearty portion. Our server was nice, but was kind of rushing us.  We couldn't figure out why, there wasn't a wait or anything.  He kept trying to take my dishes and I had to keep telling him I was still eating.

Max C.,"Naperville, IL",4,94,6,3.0,4/7/2012,"I really only come here because it's tough to find a pizza place that serves pizza individually.  The pizza is OK, it's almost unremarkable to forgettable.  But if i'm craving pizza for lunch, I have to get my fix.  The service is always good, and the managers have no problem refilling drinks themselves in case the staff is busy at the time.  The service pushes this from a 2 star to a 3 star review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-warrenville?start=60

We both ordered pasta dishes. My husband had the garlic cream fettucine with shrimp and chicken and I ordered the kung pao spaghetti with shrimp. Both of us were very pleased with our choices. The pasta was cooked al dente as it should be and the sauces were flavorful. I asked for mine extra spicy and was given a dish of hot sauce to spice it up to the level I like.

For what it is, a chain restaurant you can find just about anywhere, it's decent.  Tonight I had the penna with sausage, peppers and marinara sauce and I have to say the spices were pretty well done.  What I really enjoy about it is the kid-friendly atmosphere that includes better-prepared kid meals.  They do not have ketchup bottles on the table (or in the kitchen).  The chicken is grilled, not of the chicken finger variety.  I might get the kid's mac & cheese for myself next time.  Oh, and childrens' meals come with broccoli or grapes - well done Mr. Pizza Kitchen!

Recommendations -  * Avocado Club Egg Rolls - appetizer schmapetizer, make this your lunch! * for dinner try the Chicken Piccata, Portabello Mushroom Ravioli, or a signature pizza, such as, BBQ Chicken, Milan, or Cajun.

Jessica D.,"Arlington Heights, IL",161,817,56,4.0,7/14/2007,"This is one of the more beautifully appointed locations for CPK that I've been to. The decor is a lovely upgraded 60's lounge with warm and earth tones that totally hit me as an awesome date location. The food is always ok to good at CPK, so no big surprises need be expected. Servers seem automated androids sometimes, but that's just ranked up to job satisfaction and not your fault. CPK recently added a couple of new items such as a mediterranean salad with hummus  and feta (protein) and a lovely variety of greens, served with a side of pita -- reminiscent of their cannellini hummus appetizer but in a salad form. The wild mushroom pizza has a lovely garlic and wild mushroom taste that's hard to find elsewhere. One very good point going for CPK is that they price their drinks on the drink/appetizer menu.

Ellie M.,"Chicago, IL",13,21,18,3.0,4/14/2012,"I love their salads, which is funny because I'm a total carb-a-holic and it's crazy that I don't order pizza here. It's just that so rarely I find a good salad, made with fresh greens, veggies & cheeses, chopped and tossed the right way. CPK does this right, and for that, I am willing to pay $10-13 for a good salad. They have so many varieties. I love their Waldorf, Thai crunch, BBQ chopped & regular chopped salads. They offer them in 1/2 or full portions, and the 1/2 is perfect as a regular meal or to split with a couple friends before your meal.  Their pizza is also good, but I'm a Chicago deep-dish or authentic Italian pizza fan, so I rarely get pizza here. Some of my friends and I have been coming here since high school, and they always get the same pizzas. There is a BLT pizza!  One thing I must say, though, is that sometimes the service is a little cray cray. This one time, my girlfriend and I had this obnoxious waiter that made us very uncomfortable. He stayed too long, awkwardly chatting it up, rarely leaving us time to chat with one another. Then when we needed to pay our bill and get our food wrapped, he was nowhere to be found. The next time I visited CPK, I had a darling waitress who was delightful and very professional. I think it's just hit or miss!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-warrenville?start=40
Rebecca C.,"Chicago, IL",233,592,72,4.0,8/27/2014,"Hadn't been to a CPK in at least 12 years. Didn't miss them and never turned back. After today, though, I'm happy to have tried them again. There were 5 of us, and we were splitting a whole slew of things. The dumpling appetizers were good, as were the egg rolls with lots of avocado and bacon, which were even better. The harvest salad was surprisingly ultra fresh and delish, with lots of candied pecans, fruit, field greens, cranberries gorgonzola cheese. The best pizza and the one I would order again is the extra thin artichoke, spinach and chicken pizza. With a generous helping of these 3 ingredients and both mozzarella cheese and parmesan cheese, that was an awesome pizza. While a pasta dish was good and the meat-lovers pizza was hearty and tasty, this was the best entrée/pizza. Service was fantastic, our waiter kept up with all the drink and water refills as much as the alcoholic drinks. Couldn't really ask for more!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-warrenville?start=40
Joy S.,"Naperville, IL",576,377,136,3.0,11/14/2011,"The service is better than the food. Understanding that California does not have good pizza, CPK has better pizza than what you'd get in the actual state. But they could still use more sauce. A lot more sauce. If you're eating BBQ Chicken Pizza, you should be able to at least taste the BBQ sauce. All pizzas are 6-slice 10"" thick crust. You can have thin crust for an extra $1.50, which makes no sense that you pay more for less dough. The low price appetizers do kinda make up for the ridiculous price increase for thin crust pizza. Got 4 fried mac and cheese bites for $3.75. They were overcooked, but I like that. Would just be better with a tastier cheese, but for $3.75, can't really complain. Better cheese would probably increase the price. The location is gorgeous. I like that there's a regular door for handicapped patrons instead of the revolving door (would be too dangerous to use a revolving door whether on crutches or in a wheelchair). But the seperate door is very heavy. It would be great if they had buttons for automatic opening so a handicapped customer wouldn't have to depend on an able-bodied person to open the door for them. If I liked the food better, I'd use their Take Out frequently.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-warrenville?start=40

The waiter creeped me out and wasn't very friendly. Their appetizer menu is very small and they hardly have anything that's Italian, seriously it's a pizza place have something that's italian. I had the white pizza which was good but my boyfriend got the gluten free pizza which he thought tasted terrible.

The bread slices have shrunk, they don't bring out any Parmesan cheese or butter to go with anymore (just a dish of olive oil), and the BBQ chicken salad appeared to be completely lacking any jicama. We tried the lettuce wraps but they weren't nearly as good as the ones at Pei Wei. Oh, and when two people are dining would it have killed them to provide four pieces of lettuce instead of only three? Overpriced and underwhelming is my new view of this restaurant. I do rather like the atmosphere of this location but that's not enough to make me want to come back. I will say the hostess was absolutely wonderful and friendly.

Joanne C.,"Chicago, IL",30,81,8,4.0,11/19/2011,"This is one chain restaurant that I really like. I've been eating at CPK since it first opened at Oakbrook. Back then they still had roasted garlic shrimp pizza, which to my little kid taste buds was the best thing ever.  Fast forward to my adult years and I still come here for the pizza but I also like their appetizers, salads and entrees.  I always have to have the spinach artichoke dip. It's cheesy, creamy and savory. Probably frozen, heated up and chock full of bad things but you only live once, right? I also tried the fried mac and cheese bites. Pretty good. Can you tell I really like cheese? =) If I'm in a salad mood, I like to order the Waldorf salad with chicken or the Cobb. I love the abundance of ingredients in each salad and the option of ordering either a full or half. For pizzas, I like to order the roasted garlic chicken, wild mushroom or bbq chicken. Yum. When I want to carbo load, I'll order spaghetti bolognese, chicken piccata, or broccoli and sun-dried tomato fusilli.

We enjoyed the fresh avocado, corn and bean salsa appetizer... yet when we asked for a few more tortilla chips to finish up the dip, they charged us more. It would have been nice to have more description on the menu for the salad I ordered (BBQ chicken)... the menu just stated BBQ sauce, ranch and cilantro... there were several other things on the actual salad, including cheese, and tortilla strips, both of which I would have eliminated when ordering, to keep it healthier.

The restaurant is pretty cool and they offer curbside service if you want to order take out.  We didn't have any appetizers or desserts, so the pizza was all I had.  I'd probably come back here again, since it's close to the office.  Although I've never met a pizza I don't like, the nice thing is that they have so many different kinds of them.

The beverage: I tried something new to drink: mango iced tea. They take normal ice tea and add in sweetened flavored syrups.  They had several varieties (peach, raspberry, and another one too), but I am so happy I tried the mango.   ** Sidenote: It tastes a lot like CBTL's Mucho Mango (my favorite beverage on the planet), so you can imagine how happy I was since I normally have to travel 2,000 miles to get one of those. ** The service: Bonnie was wonderful - very helpful in making our pizza selection and attentive throughout the entire meal.  Perfect in every way!

My cheese pizza was a bit too greasy for my tastes, even after dabbing it with a napkin, but the crust had a savory hint of butter and the flavors were balanced delicately. A thin-crust pizza has to work damn hard to earn a recommendation from a die-hard deep dish fan like me, but it won me over in the end. One bit of advice? Don't you dare walk out that door without dessert. The super-sized portions are worth every penny (and calorie). I had my first taste of cheesecake ever, which tasted like it was made with real pumpkin, and my friend scooped up every last morsel of the red velvet cake. He said it was the best he'd ever had. My envious eyes (and stomach) are eagerly waiting their turn on another trip. Also of note: this is the perfect place to bring folks with food allergies. The menu notes gluten-free options, and the online menu is super helpful for vegetarians. I've never before seen a restaurant specify by lacto-ovo, vegan, and every permutation in between!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-warrenville?start=20
Kevin S.,"Winfield, IL",44,178,127,1.0,2/14/2015,"This place is terrible, starting with the wait time to the time bill came. My girlfriend and I came here one Saturday night which was our first mistake, the place was packed with long wait times. Once we were seated our waiter arrived, and he reminded me of Pauly D from the jersey shore, very fake and and annoying. The prices here are outrageous, especially for mediocre pizza. I got the gluten free pizza and it tasted like cardboard, avid what it worse was the price 16 bucks for a small personal pizza!! The girlfriend got Martini and it was almost the price of her pizza, now I'm not a cheapskate by any means, but if your going to charge an arm and a leg for your service I better leave happy and satisfied which i did not. I'll be contacting CPK to complain as well. Will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-warrenville?start=20
Ericka A.,"Chicagoland, IL",1239,1525,2754,3.0,1/8/2011,"I've decided that the food is OK. I've been more impressed at other CPKs, but this one isn't horrible. I think the service is better than the pizza. The few times I've been to this location the hostesses are friendly and efficient, the servers are fun and have never messed up an order. Only real complaint is that refills often take longer than one would like. I understand when they are busy. I don't always want a refill right away and will turn it down, but it doesn't hurt to ask again later if we've been sitting a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-warrenville?start=20
