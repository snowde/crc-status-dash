Joe S.,"Wellesley, MA",0,60,2,1.0,1/5/2015,I am constantly unimpressed with CpK. I have been here multiple times and it always disappoints. $13 for a cheese pizza that is so small. Not a good value. Spaghetti Bolognese was rated a B-/C+ from someone at our table. The service was fine but I've been here when the service is terrible. There are much better options in town.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellesley?start=20
Ran D.,"Worcester, MA",74,229,76,2.0,8/5/2011,"This place really comes through for me when I'm in a airport and California Pizza Kitchen or the chili's to go. You know you want some wine before the flight, and it's not a option for you to sit in the food court because you will get your full of crying rug rats on your flight. Then Yes!  But when our in a car and have free will at your disposal then nooooo.  If your looking for the benefits of a chain restaurant, then by all means pull up your Yelp App and find a Bertucci's.

I had been here a year back  and I can certainly say that this place has changed for the better.  The asparagus and arugula salad was impressive and the deserts were to die for.. Good job with the improvements made over the last few months! Keep it up! We are watching, CPK.

Service was shockingly slow given the server:customer ratio.  My lunch hour is from 12-1. I arrived at 12:10.  The food arrived at 12:52, at which point I asked for it to be boxed up so I could get back to work and the server asked if I'd like some coffee first.  Um, no thanks, in my job, I actually have to pay attention to the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellesley?start=20

Maureen P.,"Wellesley, MA",0,14,2,1.0,1/29/2009,Don't even bother going!! The food here is terrible...even my husband who can't tell the difference between butter and margarine thought the food was very poor quality! I had Tortilla Soup which tasted like it had corn syrup in it and Chicken pizza which had tiny pieces of chicken which you could count on one hand. Our kids had pizza's that looked like they made them ...very tiny. The ice tea drinks are $2.95 and are horrid. The service was very slow and it was *not *a busy night. The outside walk was like a skating rink and dangerous even though there were twenty two employees there(my husband counted). Go elsewhere!!!

Christopher C.,"Houston, TX",105,117,3,3.0,5/23/2009,"Okay service, okay food quality, okay prices. I am from California. I am a huge fan of CPK (and Pepsi for that matter). When traveling, if there is a CPK in the area, you will most likely find me there come dinnertime.  While this CPK is much better than the nearby Bertucci's, the service is lackluster and the quality of the food is kinda...cold. However, it depends on who is serving you. But, for the most part, it seems as if the waiters here take their sweet time moving our meals from the kitchen to the table. Recently, we (my family and I) have requested a specific waitress (whose name escapes my mind). She makes a it a priority to get our order down right and quick. Before, the other waiters have missed large portions of our order or gave us something we didn't even request. On the taste side, I have ordered the same 4 meals at about 10 CPK locations nationwide. In total, I tasted the worst version of each meal at this location. Therefore, when I visit, I tend to just order Pepperoni Pizza, which still manages to be cold when it arrives at my table (except for when this specific hostess waits on us).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellesley?start=20

Alicia D.,"Salem, MA",149,192,65,1.0,5/4/2012,"""No Soup for You"" was the motto on my first and only foray to this place.  I participated in a fundraiser at work, there was a large order from my group, and my soup was missing.  In addition to the non existent soup, I ordered the Mediterranean Hummus ""plate"", which was more like a Mediterranean Hummus ""saucer"" or ""cat dish"" for its size. This made the loss of the soup all that more tragic, as I was hungry and looking forward to my lunch.  (stomach rumbling in remembrance) So....naturally I called to ask what could be done, and I was told by the manager who came to the phone after a long wait, ""I packed the order myself and did not leave anything out.""  Well.  OK.  But.  I still don't have any soup.  The person coordinating on my end told me it was one short.  So, what's a girl to do?  The manager reluctantly agreed to process a refund, but gosh I would have LOVED if someone had brought over my soup.  I was stuck with the very tiny cat sized ""plate"" of (I admit) rather delicious hummus, a chopped mix of cucumber, onions and olives, a tablespoon of dressing, and a ""shot glass"" of feta cheese.  So, the one star is for good hummus.  But there was a crazy small amount of it.  One does not want a refund at lunchtime when they're hungry--please bring over the soup that was ordered, and DON'T try to blame it on me.  Ugh, never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellesley?start=20

Even when busy, attentive servers and managers on the ball are there to rectify those issues that inevitably come up. Best example was tonight's experience with late food that the manager and server quickly explained what went wrong and rushed the order to catch up.

colleen c.,"Brighton, MA",69,2,,2.0,12/3/2017,"I've been into CPK many times with my daughter after one of her classes or if my husband is working late. From the perimeter, it seems like a good place- kid friendly, good food selection, & even decent wine for adults. The thing is the servers seem very mad every time I go there. Like they really don't want to serve you, your bothering them, and sometimes even rude. I get that Wellesley is a Well to do town and it may feel a little like that to the service people. But here's the deal- I personally do not come from that background growing up, and I was a waitress through college. I was good to my customers - I served well. I do not feel the need to tip 20% to a waitress who seems bothered by me or who rudely drops my bill at the table without saying thank you. The food and beverage bill add up. And the quality and s just average if that. Unfortunately, we won't be returning to CPK. I'd rather spend 10-15.00 more at Alta Strada or the cottage and get better service & higher quality food.

I ordered multiple pizzas over the phone, on the  way to Wellesley to an event as well as some errands.  First impression of this place: the woman on the phone... she was so professional, it sounded like I was going to The Capital Grille. The ""Did you want Curbside?"" part, at the end was stunning... They have that? Wow.  Anyway, I didn't get curbside, because I wanted to see what the restaurant looked like, so I know what I'll be looking to come back to. The atmosphere is amazing. Lots of booths, tables, and everyone inside (employees and customers) seemed to all be having a great time. The take out counter is very small and compact, yet the guy who was there was very friendly, happy, and informative about a great rewards program they have.  Once home, the pizza was still hot (and I went somewhere after and then home another 20 minutes away in Westwood!), and was delicious. I think I like thicker pizza better, but this thin crust pizza was super delicious and tasteful. The bread was also good, yet tiny.  Overall, I would definitely return here, and will dine-in soon, as it looked like a great place to go for dinner or lunch. I wonder how the mall locations (like Natick) compare.....

Granted for that price I would not expect the best however, the Caesar was made with  veryso so bottled dressing,  shaved cheese and many mediocre croutons it had about one ounce or less of cut up salmon dispersed throughout the salad. Strange presentation. Could not easily tell what was a crouton and what was salmon.  The cubes of salmon were of approximately the same size as the plain croutons.  Ate the salad, told them to forget bringing me more salmon as I realized it was not as fresh as it should be.  The  manager comped the dinner but really-- who needs this hassle.  I cannot remember having such a poor meal.

I had the Spicy Korean BBQ Pork Pizza, which was delicious, and priced only at $12, it was a pretty good deal.  The Sobe-fruit juice drink was also good, though priced at $3, it's on the high side (even with free refills).
