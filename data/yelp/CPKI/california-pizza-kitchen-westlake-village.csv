H F.,"Woodland Hills, CA",3,93,13,4.0,7/10/2011,"I love CPK - and going to CPK ASAP is almost as good as going to the actual restaurant.  Nothing wrong with CPK ASAP other than their menu is smaller because of the establishment.  ASAP is meant as a ""quick fix"" of CPK without having to dine in if you don't want to. The food is still great.  The service is still good.  And the red velvet cake is really super good - moist and oh so yummy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westlake-village
Sunil R.,"San Francisco, CA",708,2323,12,3.0,7/4/2011,CPK is a decent option. Nothing out of the ordinary and dependable. This one is a CPK ASAP meaning there is no table service and you need to place the order yourself which is not too bad. I got the bbq chicken which is my usual.  Dessert options are strictly average. The red velvet cake and brownies are OK if you are really craving sugar.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westlake-village
Rachel P.,"Renton, WA",91,730,18,3.0,10/5/2008,We went for lunch one day.  The service was pretty good. Food good and quick.  Not much else a person can ask for. A bit spendy but - everything in stupid california is expensive. I still prefer the frozen CFK thin crust from my grocer's freezer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westlake-village
Staci F.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",35,141,,3.0,10/25/2012,"This place is always a hit or miss for me. A miss because i am not usually a fan or corporate food chains. But i can't seem to steer away from the cobb salad they have. Its amazing!! I love how they offer a full or half size. The half size is a perfect portions. It comes with Beets too!! my fave!! anyways. I only go here for my salad. Otherwise, there food is your usual food chain food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westlake-village
David O.,"Walnut Creek, CA",127,1284,937,4.0,1/11/2007,"I just got back from CPK where I lunched with some coworkers.   I know this'll probably blow your mind, but this was the first time I've eaten at CPK.   Not just this particular location, but *any* location.  Until about an hour ago, I was a California Pizza Kitchen n00b. So what do I think?  The quality of the pizza is 3 stars.  It ain't bad, but it ain't really that good either.   The decor, at least as far as this location goes, also 3 stars.  The seats aren't particularly comfortable though they're kind enough to have heat lamps outside.  Still, it's pretty f***ing cold at this time of year, so if you're gonna sit out, wear a jacket or a sweater. They get 4 stars primarily because there aren't that many places in this area (Westlake Village/Agoura Hills) where you can get a personal size pizza.   If you want pizza for lunch, you ain't gonna love it here, but at least you'll have the ability to eat it.  That, or you gonna have to fight it out with your coworkers to determine what toppings to get, and you know how ugly those fights get.  And besides, even if you win, you better hope you didn't piss off your supervisor, or he'll shaft your sorry ass come bonus time.   No... clearly CPK personal pizza is a safer way to go...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westlake-village
Max F.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,25,,4.0,1/13/2010,"Food is okay, but the staff and the MILF customers that go to that place are HOT!! My friends and I go there just to drool over the hotties.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westlake-village
Nicholas C.,"Oceanside, CA",57,456,121,3.0,4/12/2012,"The girls in here seem cute and energetic when they work. I like that, makes me feel like my food is getting prepared to the best of its abilities. Over all decent pizza and good artichoke dip. They could get little more variety with the beverages though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westlake-village
K D.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,26,,1.0,4/6/2012,"Food is significantly worse then the real cpk. Will never eat here again. Avoid at all costs. The actual place has a better menu option. This is a sad attempt at a resturant. ASAP or not, I'd rather eat better food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westlake-village
Maggie M.,"Las Vegas, NV",168,246,277,4.0,11/21/2011,"There are some good things and bad things about CPK ASAP.  I love the speed as to how they help you and the fact that you can have a delicious lunch and be able to go back to work in time.  There of course aren't as many options as a regular CPK but you can't ask for everything in a place that's in the middle of businesses.  I have fallen in love with salads and I had their Chinese Chicken and since I'm staying on the lighter side of my meals I order the dressing on the side and it's so delicious.  The chicken is nice and moist and tender, not something you'd expect at a ""fast food"" place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westlake-village
Josh A.,"Minneapolis, MN",270,232,72,4.0,2/11/2009,"Great foood. Great servers. Great managers. Great location. Food is REALLY bad for you though.  Watch your pockets and waistlines.  In fact, they can't even provide a nutional guide.  But, did you know their most popular item, has about 700 calories and 101 grams of carbs?  Yowza!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westlake-village
Lilani E.,"Seattle, WA",753,657,78,4.0,2/12/2007,This is actually a CPK ASAP.  It's my first time trying it but already it is a huge convenience!   You can call in after work (like myself) and give them your credit card info and simply drive up and they will run it out to you.  Such a perk!   The menu is not as extensive as a regular sized CPK BUT it does have the classics.   Very good for the Corporate America community of WLV.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westlake-village
David C.,"Lake Forest, CA",138,57,33,4.0,12/27/2009,I visit this CPK ASAP often and they have one of my favorite sandwiches (the turkey club sandwich)!  Their curb side assistance is very good and their service is extremely friendly!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westlake-village
Pamela X.,"Agoura Hills, CA",7,29,,4.0,3/8/2009,"I love this CPK ASAP.  They have everything I like on the menu. My favorite is the half Waldorf Chicken Salad.  I also like the Sedona Tortilla Soup, Italian Tomato & Basil Pizza and BBQ Chicken Salad.   When eating with friends, I like the Thousand Oaks CPK restaurant at the Lakes.  The area is beautiful and you can walk around the pond after dinner.  In the winter they have an ice skating rink and I like the Coffee Bean next door for an after dinner tea. Next time I want to try some of the other salads and  pizzas to see if I have a new favorite. I've also been to the Simi Valley CPK at the Town Center Mall and it is great too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westlake-village
Stefanie N.,"Simi Valley, CA",3,26,10,4.0,2/19/2009,"I wasn't sure what CPK ""ASAP"" implied, what the difference would be. so i went online to the CPK ASAP website and it told me nothing. well finally i tried it. You stand in line, order at the register, pay and receive a table number then find a seat. The soda machine is out for you to help yourself and the waiters bring you your food, never to return. That was all fine, but for their prices, i would rather have gone to a regular restaurant style CPK.  The food tasted just as good. What annoyed me was the menu i saw online, located on their CPK ASAP website. It shows all the regular food that CPK serves, so i was excited to get salmon or perhaps pasta. Nope, only a small selection of pizzas, sandwiches and salads. most salads and sandwiches being pre-made and in a fridge next to the register.  They get 4 stars because it was ""ASAP"" like the name says, the service was friendly, and the food was good. I ordered ""The Works"" pizza, very tasty, lots of toppings. My dad ordered the chicken and bacon panini. It looked sooo good, that's what i want to get when i go to a NORMAL CPK next. They lack that 5th star because the prices are much too high for the type of ""restaurant"" they are. And their indoor seating is way too limited, especially during lunch time. Although they do have a lot of outside seating, but with the wind blowing at what felt like 80 mph i wasn't too pleased to be sitting outside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westlake-village
Anthony H.,"Tarzana, CA",53,284,594,3.0,10/25/2007,"The new Works pizza at CPK!!!....................huh? They never had a normal pizza?  This pizza was so disappointing.  It almost tasted as if i was eating a pizza from Domino's during my high school years.  I'm not fond of bready pizza dough.  CPK is somewhat known for their light but bready pizzas. But this CPK ASAP dough was like soft bread.  The pizza itself wasn't interesting at all. In fact, although it had pepperoni, sausage, onion, bell pepper, and some other minor ingredients, it was some what bland.  I also ordered the waldorf salad.  Like usual, it wasn't bad but the candied walnuts were a little stale tasting.  The balsamic dressing, was the best thing about it. Over all it wasn't bad. On the average side. Not a place I would go out of my way for.  But if you like Waldorf salads, try the Orchard salad from Coral Tree.  Although I think the dressing is a tad too tart, it's an awesome salad.  The place is CPK ASAP, so it's small but it has some out door seating and the plaza also has a Bristol Farms, Fedrick's stores, B & N, Sur La Table, and an assortment of other stores similar to The Commons in Calabasas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westlake-village
lynn s.,"Irvine, CA",0,15,,5.0,11/22/2010,"This location has really good quality food compared to some other CPK.  The food is always fresh and the salad dressing is perfect.  The staff are also very friendly.  When I crave CPK, I go to this location. My mom is a very picky eater and she is very happy with the food here.  I love the Hawaiian pizza and the sandwich salad combo.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westlake-village
Jennifer D.,"Oak Park, CA",6,337,,3.0,5/1/2008,It's a typical CPK.  I dig the pizzas and I really like their salads.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westlake-village
