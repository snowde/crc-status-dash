Jt S.,"Chicago, IL",0,12,,5.0,9/23/2017,My partner and I came here for lunch when we were visiting Guadalajara for a 10k run. We came in and received the best service I've had in quite some time from Aidee. Her hospitality and personality were AMAZING and she made our dining experience perfect. The food and drinks were excellent but she was our favorite part. Thanks for the great experience here in Guadalajara.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-zapopan
