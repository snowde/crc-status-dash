Howie K.,"Albuquerque, NM",3293,1194,3463,3.0,11/7/2017,"You bet I have an appetite for this stuff. Whatever you think of me, please don't assign adjectives like Discerning, Sophisticated or Tasteful to my tastebuds. Last night I opened a Red Robin menu for the first time in my life and found myself fantasizing about sodium and cheese and chicken wangs and bacon and fried things and I seriously couldn't make up my mind for about 20 minutes, it was a toss-up between about six burgers, four appetizers and, well, basically various salts. I noted that all the tables had canisters of Red Robin seasoning, a quarter teaspoon provides 13 percent of your Daily Value of sodium. Salt is cheap, plentiful, and our synapses go apesh#t for the goods. Paired with an ice cold IPA (guys, you need more local beers, please) and a football game, it's a recipe for an all-American good time.  Overall, that's what we had, a good time, and they were terrific hosts. We were celebrating the birthday of a nine year-old, and our server -- wanna say his name was Aubrey -- was completely on top of his game, he worked really hard, and put up with some kids overdosing on salt and sugar, in style. Everything I ate, including some bites of neighboring plates, tasted exactly as I anticipated.  I do need to close on this minor shrewd note. Red Robin is one of many national chains that provides, at little extra cost, video games on tabletop tablets. I'm assuming they're assuming parents like me will appreciate this. I don't, in fact, this minor provision really gets under my skin. First, for the love of food, for the love of that age-old tradition of dining together, and connecting, and getting away from our stupid electronic gadgets, please, get rid of the tablets. And for parents like us, who avidly deny our kids these devices -- especially during dinner -- man, you're making it hard for us to have conversations with our kids, because they're envious of the kids that get to zone out until the food arrives. It's just bad all around. Just, really. You lost our business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque-4

Jean C.,"Albuquerque, NM",11,85,427,3.0,11/22/2017,This was not a great visit at all. Normally I don't have any issues with service or food but this time everything was off. Our waiter didn't listen intently. It wasn't busy but our food took awhile to come our. My friend asked for no tomato on her burger and they put one on. Our waiter didn't refill my fries.

Don S.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,23,12,1.0,1/7/2018,"Went this store and was kinda surprised by not only the crumbs and mess on every inch of the floor to ultra lack of consistency in the food ordered a special menu burger and have to say for 13 bucks it was a huge disappointment. And in some way the bottomless frys were not at all bottomless as the plate was served with 8 frys and when I asked for more it took 15 minutes to get 10 more on a dirty plate no less Mic D""S is a better choice at least they are consistent and clean",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque-4

Doing a search listed Red Robin as dog friendly and although they were closed for the winter upon our arrival, Chathan the host was nice enough and accommodating and opened the area and let us sit for lunch.

J.M. C.,"Albuquerque, NM",12,36,44,5.0,7/15/2017,"Giving 5-stars for the service. Alex was on her game made it real enjoyable. Never had an empty beverage, she was very knowledgeable answered all our questions  knew her menu. Fresh sweet tea. Enjoyed the Tavern Double delicious flamebroiled taste to the burger. A decent size double cheeseburger with Tavern Sauce, similar to Mac sauce. Bottomless salad always a good thing with house made ranch. Our grandma got a huge order of fish and chips, plenty to take home. The atmpsphere is a little lacking compared to the Westside location by Cottonwood but anyhow Alex made it a 5star meal with her service and convincing us to sign up for the rewards. We will come back to this location just to dine with her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque-4

After our first bite we both did the ""yummmm"" thing.  Lots of parking and we sat down right away! We took advantage of the bottomless fries and the waiter kept asking if we wanted more. Shout out to Jose! The waiter made this experience 5 star for sure. The food was yummm but he was the ketchup on the burger!

Krista C.,"Rio Rancho, NM",4,4,,1.0,11/11/2017,"My husband ordered a burger with no cheese or mayo, it had both on it. I ordered a whiskey river bbq wrap, there was an orange slice in it.

Tania S.,"Albuquerque, NM",219,624,1495,3.0,3/23/2017,"Somewhere in the middle is Red Robin, which screams ""BURGER CHAIN"" but tones the flavor the most down. This brand new location is sure to get the office crowd in, but I don't know that I'd return on my own merit. For as much updating Red Robin has done lately, this Red Robin is just like all the others. During lunch, sure, you'll get service at the bar. Portions have scaled down for onion rings. The taste and menu haven't changed much either. There's nothing new about Red Robin, just the decor. Their automated kiosks made the experience just that much more impersonal. It's new, but not really.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque-4
Tracy W.,"Albuquerque, NM",73,265,281,3.0,4/28/2017,"It's a Red Robin! It's a convenient location, in front of Dillard's in the Winrock area. The service has been hit or miss; my most recent visit being more of a miss (I was sitting alone and was ignored for quite a while before I finally managed to flag someone down.)  The food quality has been pretty good here, maybe better than the other locations. However, I'd give the service prize to the I-25/Jefferson location.  Pro tip: If you eat at Red Robin regularly, join their rewards thing. I often get $4 off my order, free items, and sometimes free burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque-4
Sammie L.,"Albuquerque, NM",5,95,2,3.0,4/23/2017,"Meh. I didn't really like the layout of this new location. I was not a fan of the U-shaped bar. I also was disappointed in our bartender. The titos and soda water he made was weak, and he didn't go out of his way to serve us or give us great service like we are used to at the Office location.  We will drive further next time just to have our favorite bartender, Zach, wait on us at the Office location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque-4
Keri R.,"Stockbridge, GA",10,26,8,2.0,5/20/2017,"This is a fun family restaurant with a widely varied menu for anybody in the family. The burgers are delicious, the fries are endless and the drinks are delicious. The service was very good, I was seated quickly in the bar area and the staff was very attentive.  The noise level can get high because this is a family friendly restaurant but not on this visit.  Unfortunately the food tonight was not up to the quality I've come to expect. The French dip sandwich was soggy before I was able to dip it in the au jus. The cheese bread of the sandwich just couldn't hold up to this sandwich and subsequently I had a roast beef blob. I'm sure this was an anomaly but it certainly influenced my rating for this visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque-4
Veronica B.,"Albuquerque, NM",81,139,566,3.0,8/20/2017,"Red Robin is one of those restaurants that you completely forget about nut when you drive by one all you can think is mmmm...endless fries! The one of the newer Red Robin at Winrock is decent. We went with the kids and it was pretty crowded and got seated fairly quickly. The manager was very nice, courteous and attentive. Our waiter just seemed like he was in such a rush that he didn't really listen but after asking for a second or third time for something he was apologetic and respectful. We had the endless fries, which used to be a large portion of fries and you'd maybe fill up twice, now they put like 10 fries in the basket and the kids munch them up, so it's like you are asking and the waiter is going back and forth with fries. Maybe ask if you want a large portion or small portion to fit your needs (i.e. two ppl vs co-workers or a family of four). We had the guacamole, salsa and chips. The guacamole was very good. The kids had the chicken tenders and pizza and fries. I had the cheese burger with green chile on the side. He had the black bacon cheeseburger. There is a tablet for the kids to play but please know you'll be charged a $1.99 fee that you don't find out about until you get the check, a little frustrating they don't tell you before hand. If you want a nice family dinner out go to Red Robin but go for the food and don't expect too much from the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque-4

Ashley S.,"Albuquerque, NM",44,21,12,2.0,8/17/2017,"MEH. So the burgers here are glammed up not super special. The decor is actually nice, my biggest problem was the service we went there around mid day, not much business which we like. The waitress started out decent but service quickly deteriorated. She was literally vaccuming and cleaning while ignoring us. We had to ask for refils on our drinks and I'm sure our order had been sitting in the back ready because when it came to us it was room temp. For these reasons, I'm afraid we cant recommend",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque-4

An outdoor patio would've been awesome as well. The service was excellent we were served immediately, but the burgers were kinda dry and the fries were over done.

Monica N.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,5,,2.0,12/1/2017,"This Red Robin has the worst service of all the others in ABQ. We have given them multiple tries and each time, huge disappointment. A couple of of times, we've been the ""community table"" as in we didn't have one server we just had multiple servers coming and helping us. The last visit we had was the last straw for my boyfriend, after not having anyone help us for about 10 minutes then becoming the community table, getting our food late and then finally having a charge added to our bill that wasn't ours. The unfortunate thing is now my boyfriend won't go with me over there anymore. Yes the service leaves much to be desired but I do really enjoy the food when it does come out right. We will not dine in to this restaurant again unless we do to-go orders. For some reason I've never had a problem with the to go orders so whoever is doing that, is doing an awesome job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque-4?start=20

Stephen G.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,103,36,2.0,7/11/2017,"Sometimes, I'm totally in the mood for Red Robin... because French fries are even better when they are endless in my book. I recently tried their vegan burger at the I25 location and really liked it so we tried the version closer to our house tonight. It is new and we figured that would mean a great experience. However, things were off to a bad start as soon as we arrived. Parking is pretty annoying - there are only about 5 spots near the building and everything else is mall parking so it feels weird. Inside, the restaurant only had a few tables seated but there was no one at the host stand. We stood around a while until the manager eventually came by and seated us. At a dirty booth, as it turned out. No big, we thought. We are pretty easygoing - just the seats were dirty and the table appeared clean. Our server was friendly. However, my menu had a big glop of mayo on two of the inside pages and as I looked around the restaurant it reminded me of a dirty diner or something and not a newer restaurant. The carpet was dirty and lots of debris and food was littered about, many tables were haphazardly left half uncleaned, and the people who were seated all seemed to be flagging down waitstaff... not good signs. Our food came out quickly and the order was correct, but I noticed a hair on my tomato pretty much immediately. I set that aside and dove in to th burger only to find another hair cooked into my sautéed mushrooms. I decided I should let the manager know, but he never came by. Finally told the server and made it clear I didn't want a replacement or discount or anything, just wanted them to know about the problem since two hairs had made it into one burger which seemed to me to be indicative of a problem in the kitchen. I had eaten a lot of my burger by the time I found the second hair and certainly didn't want a free meal or a replacement meal. However, the waitress came back and said the manager was glad we said something and insisted to take the hairy burger off the check. The manager also came over to apologize before we left. I felt like that was very kind and appropriate and I appreciated the way it was handled. If the only problem had been a hairy burger, I wouldn't have even mentioned it, as problems happen sometimes even when everyone is trying their best.  So, why two stars? Honestly, I don't think I have ever been to a Red Robin that deserved five stars - it always feels like a chain trying to be cool with flair galore. I think the food, atmosphere, etc. at Red Robin is usually a three or four star experience at best. The fact pretty much every part of our dining experience had some sort of issue makes me very weary to give this location another try. The combo of no host to greet us, an unclean overall feeling in the restaurant, and hairy food isn't really something I will want again ... even if the service and handling of a problem was nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque-4?start=20
Daniel C.,"Albuquerque, NM",51,11,1,1.0,6/27/2017,"Third time trying Red Robin and it will finally be the last. When a customer asks for no tomatoes it means NO TOMATOES! Cottonwood, 25 way, and winrock center have all failed in this department. After this time I was done! No I don't want it fixed no I don't want something else what I want is to never give Red Robin my money ever again. Also we had one app a shake and one burger... $30!!!!!!! I buy burgers from another competitor and pay half that and feed us both. Gourmet is in the name only to make you feel better about paying $15 bucks for a bleu cheese burger.

The waiter was very curt and unhelpful. Fries were mushy and the burger I ordered (garden) was pretty tasteless. The entire time this weird repetitive music was blasting driving my entire table crazy. To top it off was the little kiosk thing on the table. I've seen them before but never to this level. It cut out almost all need for actual human interaction and was very irritating. No real bill was given, you had to pay on the kiosk which had many steps and was very confusing.

We entered the restaurant and had plenty of time to glance around the place, about five minutes, while the party in front of us tried to communicate the number of people in her party to the hostess. We saw plenty of empty tables and booths. We saw plenty of trash on the floor. Like, they should vacuum every once in a while. Many children, and an ungodly ambient noise level. TVs on sports channels. Like, why not variety and have a business or news channel in one section? Who cares about lame midday Friday sports? Finally our turn to be seated after hearing the prior party be told their table would be ready in about twenty minutes. The two of us were then told there would be a fifteen minute wait amidst all the empty seats. I glanced again at the dirty floor, the kids all over, listened to the noise and wife said: not worth it.
