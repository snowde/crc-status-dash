Vaughn F.,"Albuquerque, NM",20,250,244,5.0,7/17/2017,"My visit to Red Robin yesterday, after taking in a matinee at the Cinemark 24 theater, was as good as I could have hoped for. It had been a couple years since I'd been a patron at this franchise of burger-themed restaurants, and it was my first time at the Albuquerque location since childhood. With age, I've come to appreciate the efforts that Red Robin makes to accommodate families, couples, drinkers, and the young. There seems to be something for everyone here. I ordered a bottle of Miller Lite ($3.50) and, guided by my heart, opted for the A1 Peppercorn Burger (as lampooned in season 15 of South Park). The food arrived quickly, but after a few bites, it was clear that the meat wasn't medium-rare, but rather, well done. Weighing my options, I decided to seek satisfaction and notified my waitress that the burger wasn't prepared how I'd ordered it. She sent it back to the kitchen, and a replacement was brought out swiftly. The second time was the charm. Reasonably pink inside, I accepted this sandwich and savored every bite. My waitress was quick to keep the steak fries coming, and I certainly ate my fill. At some point, it's necessary to cut the cord before too much gluttony transpires. Overall, I was satisfied by the food, and I appreciated the kitchen staff's willingness to remake my hamburger. Though the addition of tablets to every booth and table brings Red Robin in line with Applebee's and Chili's for chilling post-millennial digital invasiveness, I understand how these devices can generate revenue and simplify certain ordering practices. At the end of the day, I still prefer old-fashioned human interaction, and this I received in abundance from the waitress. Perhaps on another special occasion I'll venture back to this eatery; meanwhile, I have happy memories to tide me over.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque
Jeremiah B.,"Los Lunas, NM",2,10,2,1.0,1/3/2018,"Firstly, the one star review had nothing to do with the server, Eric, because he was awesome. Sadly, a server can only do so much and all they do is place the order and deliver it anyway. My order was a ghost pepper burger but received a reg burger with BBQ sauce and jalapeño slices but no ghost pepper sauce and no jalapeño coins (fried and breaded). The cook argued with the waiter that it wasn't bbq sauce but there is a huge difference and this wasn't my first ghost pepper burger... this is the same burger I get every time I go to any Red Robin... and this was not it. When the waiter returned, I noticed all the cook did was shove 6 small jalapeño coins under the bun, crinkling the bun and not making the burger any better and the cook didn't add the ghost pepper sauce either.  I wasn't going to send it back again because I didn't want to eat spit or something else... I simply did without a burger because this one was horrible. Second thing that didn't help was the fact that we ordered Garlic Parmesan fries and they sent sweet potatoe fries instead... when the waiter brought my replacement fries... they were plain... not garlic Parmesan.   The waiter offered to take the burger off my bill but didn't see that taken off. We were running late so I just paid and decided to leave this review instead. By far the worst experience I've ever had at a Red Robin (And I've been to Red Robin's across the country. I'll never return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque
L R.,"Albuquerque, NM",101,26,40,4.0,12/9/2017,I really like the option of curbside to go I used it for the first time today and it was very easy and quick. I was a little disappointed that I bought the Avo-Cabo salad and it's a much smaller portion then it used to be. Also there were only three little slices of avocado in the salad. Considering the price is $10.99 and the name suggest there's gonna be a lot of avocado I was a bit disappointed. Otherwise the salad & the tea tasted good so that's a plus. Come on Red Robin don't be so cheap with the avocado next time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque

Dee S.,"Albuquerque, NM",49,26,29,4.0,9/6/2017,"Red Robin's! Yummmmmm... You can always count on Red Robin Gourmet Burger to satisfy that huge hunger feeling. I ordered the Advo-Cobb Salad which was extremely fresh, delicious and HUGE and my partner ordered the fish and chips which is my 2nd favorite item on the menu. Neither one of us finished our dinner, which meant we had left-overs for lunch the next day. We also had the Pickle Nickles for an appetiizer and the Pickle Nickle sauce is the bomb! Our server Ashley was perfect, checking in on us constantly, but not too frequently, to make sure we were well taken care of. Red Robin's is a fun place to take the family with large and small appetites, and everybody leaves happy and satisfied! We had had a very busy day and needed a good filling meal.

Jeanie M.,"Albuquerque, NM",227,519,803,4.0,1/4/2017,"I've enjoyed burgers here before, but am super psyched about the patty in a lettuce wrap option. I tried the Whiskey River BBQ Burger with lettuce to replace a bun. Yum. The burger was served hot and the produce was fresh.  It was great. My hubby had a mushroom and Swiss burger...he said it was very good.  Service was great. Drinks were refilled quickly. In fact, each table had a call button for guests wishing to call the server over.

Dave O.,"Albuquerque, NM",110,234,213,3.0,1/31/2017,"Let me preface with, if given the chance, I'll always go to an independently, locally owned Mom & Pop joint before I'll go to a large chain restaurant like this one. However, every now and again you find yourself in one out of necessity or geography. We were actually headed out on a Friday night to a different restaurant, however, things happened.   So, Friday night, it's just Red Robin, what gives? What on Earth is going on? Is there a convention in town or something? My goodness, 30 minutes later and we finally get seated. Our waitress, though, very efficient! Nice, well knowledgeable about their menu and Johnny (or Jenny) on the spot with service!  The food? Reliable! That is the upside, in my opinion, of a chain restaurant like this, or Applebee's, or go on down the list, they're generally consistent, which is a good thing. The pretzel bites? Amazing!!!! The burgers? Once again, very reliable! We were all pretty satisfied with our meal, and guess what... they have beer milkshakes! I know, right? How crazy is that? Actual milkshakes with beer as a main ingredient. I doubt you'll get looped on them, after all, you'd probably suffer from brain freeze prior to getting looped, but pretty cool anyway. Like most of you, we'll return from time to time, how can you go wrong?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque
Cass V.,"Albuquerque, NM",104,97,81,3.0,11/4/2016,Would have been 5 stars if the waitress Jolene didn't argue with my mother and I about where we could sit in the bar. We asked the bartender and 3 hostesses if it was okay to sit in a booth and she would NOT let us. Luckily we got a table where we didn't receive her terrible service. We got burgers and beers and it was still worth it. I just wish we know why this waitress was being so uptight about where we could sit... I guess she wanted us to sit in the back of the... restaurant. I recommend just sitting in the normal restaurant. Avoid the waitresses who are rude at the begin and enjoy the beers :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque
Eric And Jennifer R.,"Austin, TX",16,618,38,2.0,6/3/2017,I'm being generous with two stars.  They had the Stanley cup game on.  The servers and kitchen had issues today.  I didn't get the drinks I ordered.  We ordered chips and salsa.  We got about 10 oily strips of chips and one ounce of half frozen salsa.  We waited 30 minutes for the food to come out.  My salmon tasted like cardboard; about 15 minutes over cooked. My fish arrived with just the dry salmon.  No broccoli or coleslaw.  Our server then gave another patron a shower with a cup of water.  The couple next to us complained about their food too.  The manager didn't do anything to minimize the horrible experience.  I would go back to Red Robin but not this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque
Arianna M.,"San Rafael, NM",0,28,,2.0,3/10/2017,"Servers are great, I would give them five stars if I could. They were busy as all get out , so i don't blame them for the slow check. There were two of them running an area meant for 4 servers, maybe 5. Someone had called in sick, one guy showed up and was angry because he was immediately being given two tables with larger parties. The two servers there hadn't made it to take their orders yet.. The manager need to hire more or manage time better. Maybe help out when it's busy as it was.  I could have left, if the manager/supervisors would keep their ziosks in working order.

Angela G.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,15,3,3.0,3/12/2017,"This place has had its shares of ups and downs mostly due to the frequent management changes. But the corporate decisions certainly do not help trying to cut corners wherever and however they can, always at the customers' expense. Their ""cups"" of soup now at the same price of $3.99 are served in a dish so small its the equivalent of an olive dish. Their side salads at $4.99 are now served in a small bread dish. Ridiculous!

David C.,"Peoria, AZ",37,226,337,1.0,10/14/2016,"This is from an experience about two weeks. I think it needs to be posted. I had the macaroni plate, new item I suppose. It was good until I noticed it was cold in the middle and not all of the cheese was melted. The top part was crunchy, and I liked that, but it was probably from a heat lamp that didn't get it up to temp. Needless to say, I was popping rolaids and seltzer water with sprite like there was no tomorrow the following week after. It's crucial to make sure food is up to the correct temperature. If you allow the heat lamp to do YOUR WORK, you could get someone sick, and I did. Dairy products have to be up to the correct temperature.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque
Nani S.,"Albuquerque, NM",6,6,,1.0,10/17/2016,"Every time, we come here, they screw up our order 75% of the time. They screw up with my husband's burger, so when they came with the new one. They charged us for both. The manager took off the one off our bill. On the milkshakes, the classic, is way less then an average one.. Stop being unfair with the amount & give out more for $4.95. What's with the hospitality?! The server was nice until, I ask for a medium free style burger to add  Blue Cheese & grilled onions on it. She corrected me on the menu. But after ordering, she was nice again.. Absurd. I am tired of the bad attitude/ tough of people. No need. What we have to go by the menu, if not I'm messing up your work.really ?!  They need to be a waitress & be nice & have patiences. We as Customers gives you business & trips. So think twice about having an attitude. No return to this location.  I was a hostess, waitress & Bartender. I had Customers substitute a lot of things.  It's your part to write down,what the Customers want before the kitchen. So the kitchen can make what we want.

Denise M.,"Oswego, IL",41,51,52,3.0,4/8/2016,"For a chain burger joint it is fine, but I have to say, if you could manage to serve my husband a warm meal, we would probably still frequent as often as we used to.  My daughter loved your kids spaghetti meal and the fact it was all she could eat. I have always gotten the bacon guacamole burger and enjoy it. The tower of onion rings were always a hit, but no matter what my husband ordered, he was always disappointed in a luke-warm meal.

Dave D.,"Albuquerque, NM",87,350,215,4.0,11/29/2015,"Wow! Nicely done! Now that Red Robin has added ""and Brews"" to it's name, they have also upgraded the décor of the restaurant. It is now very well appointed (for a Red Robin) and more adult. They've also added on table electronic ordering where you can order everything from your first beer to desert without having to ""wait"" on the waiter. You can also pay your bill through this handy little gadget as well as play games (for a couple of extra bucks). The burgers and fries were good, as always, no surprise there.

I got the teriyaki chicken sandwich, one friend got a cheeseburger, and the other got a salad with chopped chicken. Salad Friend's salad was swimming in dressing, too much dressing. Cheeseburger friend and I enjoyed our sandwiches. Even after our sandwiches and bottomless fries and broccoli, we still had enough room for dessert and split the chocolate fruffles (chocolate sticks with berry sauce on the side). The service was super-slow, so slow that Salad Friend wanted to talk to a manager.

Tracy W.,"Albuquerque, NM",73,265,281,4.0,10/15/2015,"As a gluten-free diner, I am mildly obsessed with the lettuce-wrapped burgers at Red Robin.  I usually opt for the Tavern Double with added pickles and a side of campfire sauce for my fries.  The guacamole bacon burger is another good option.  Service has been hit or miss, and it's typically better in the restaurant than in the bar area.  My favorite server left Albuquerque around the same time I did, and I missed him on my most recent visit.

Valerie M.,"Albuquerque, NM",23,82,86,2.0,3/11/2015,"We come here every so often and usually enjoy it, today was not one of those times, so unfortunately 2 stars today. Chips, salsa and guacamole were just ok, I wouldn't order them again, but was hungry so we ate them. Shared twonthings, one of them being The fiery ghost tavern burger, on the menu says ""this combo of ghost pepper sauce, pepper jack cheese and fried and fresh jalapeños will have you seeing double."" The server told us the pic was deceiving.  That it is actually two kid patties, not two regular patties, we were fine with that and thankful she told us.  When we ordered it at a medium cook, she said we couldn't,  because they were small they had to come medium well...no bueno. However for just $2 more we could get a single large pattie and get it cooked to our liking. That resulted in about a 6 Oz pattie cooked well, awesome. There were only two fried jalapeños in the whole burger, but we're soggy from some sort of sauce slathered on both the top and bottom bun, I didn't wanna know what it was.  I would never order that burger again, and the size of the pattie was in no way worth the regular price of the burger, much less the $2 up charge.  We got a prime rib dip was was pretty good.  I understand that sourdough bread can get hard, but half of it was unedible.  I just had dental work done, no way was I gonna even attempt to chew that thing, but we ate most of the meat. K got mac n cheese, kraft if always reliable. The fries, well, we're HORRIBLE! And I remember really liking them. So I ordered a fresh side of fries which was brought to us still hot.  And those were delicious...for about 2 minutes.  They then we're hard and cold.   The 2 stars come from the expo window. ..and our burger and fries.  The expo window can be seen from most of the restaurant.  The kitchen was throwing out plates of food and they pretty much just sat in the window for minutes on end. I counted 11 minutes on a group of burgers cuz we had nothing else to do but wait for our server.

I don't recommend ordering mixed drinks though. I ordered the Spiked Sweet Tea. It was bitter & not even made correctly. It was supposed to be tea flavored Vodka & lemonade but it didn't have any lemonade in it. I sent it back to be remade. It came back looking & tasting more like it should but it still doesn't come even remotely close to the delicious spiked sweet tea at Cheddar's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque?start=40

My daughter is getting a headache and needs to eat soon so I jump out of the car while my wife is parking to save time. The hostess checks us in a gives a 25 minute wait. That seems reasonable. We wait inside for the 25 minutes as multiple tables are called.  I go up to the hostess and ask her how much longer the wait might be. Her answer: ""Oh about another 20 - 25 minutes."" I explain to her that we have already been waiting that long and her response is to just look at me blankly. Meanwhile my daughter's headache is well on its way.

But I love their ranch sprinkled with a little of their bottled red robin seasoning. As if I need to add any more salt right?  The shakes are usually good, except for the salted caramel...too much salt in that one.

Molly S.,"Albuquerque, NM",75,5,1,1.0,3/26/2016,"I wish I didn't have to even give a star. We went in with a larger group (9 + a high chair) on a Saturday night. When we arrived there was only one group of 4 in front of us. We were told it would be a 30 minute wait. After about 40 minutes and seeing people getting sat in front of us, including tables of 6. We approached the hostess stand where we were simply told ""I'm not sure how much longer."" 55 minutes goes by and we see 3 groups that came in after us leave before we even got sat! We again approached the hostess stand after an hour, double the time we were told to wait, and let them know we have seen multiple tables that arrived after us leave and we haven't been sat! Their response, ""yea I know"" at this point we were livid! We called another restaurant to see what their wait was while we went to speak to a manager. The manager was just as useless as the hostess staff.  He had no empathy towards our situation. We decided we were leaving and at that point he was trying to get us to stay. The manager we dealt with was Joe and he was not an individual that I would make a manager. I have been in customer service all my life and I am a manager for a hotel in the area. I know and understand how to empathize and apologize to a guest when they are upset. Joe did neither of those. I will not recommend this location to any of the guests that stay at my hotel and hope that this post does some good and gets the staff retrained so they know how to work with their guests.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque?start=40

Went there for my moms birthday sat on the patio and first problem that came up was the ground was full of a broken ketchup bottle all over had to hardly set my feet down to not get them nasty and dirty. When they brought us appetizer plates, my moms was not clean. It was quite dirty. My mom told him this plate isn't clean bring me a new one. So he argued that it was and then walked into the building (still in sight of us) and whipped it off with his shirt. Came out and tried to give it to her my mom called him out on it and said we watched you this isn't clean this is still dirty. Finally he brought  us a clean dish. It was a horrible experience.

Jenn G.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,29,1,2.0,12/28/2015,"Red Robin recently refurbished this location and the changes are much more than cosmetic. They are obviously going for a more upscale look and it looked great but the service, which was once excellent was very bad. We saw our server maybe twice. It took him 20 minutes to get us our drinks (water!) I looked over and saw him take them off another empty table that he had placed them on to go get another customer the sugar packet bowl and must have forgotten! Also a dirty table next to us sat empty and un-bussed for almost the entire time we were there. There were a lot of people, but certainly wouldn't call the place crowded. The food was of the same quality but when the service is so poor, the desire to spend your money there is low.

Rudy H.,"Albuquerque, NM",98,53,110,1.0,6/6/2014,"Well, I really don't like to give bad reviews but here goes. It started out well enough but I knew something was wrong when the waiter had 4 tables and he was having issues keeping track of his area. Granted I've never been a waiter and I'm not judging him but I saw other waiters that seem to have more tables and they seemed to tend to customers effortlessly. So I chalked it up to he must have been new. He meant well but I could easily tell he was overwhelmed. I ordered their new Colossus Burger and I didn't include the picture but instead I included a picture of the ""picture"" because once I got it, it looked nothing like the picture which made me kind of upset. I think if you advertise something it should look like the picture. Instead I got the lazy mans version which was pretty frustrating. There was suppose to be ""brisket"" on the burger but it was nowhere in sight and if it was, it was buried under the mounds of onions. I'm not a big fan of onions so I took it off looking for the brisket and I found maybe one or two small pieces. The burger it self was just ok, I could have done better at home honestly. Get a charcoal grill, fresh patties and BAM, a better burger then I ate. As the waiter was running from table to table, refilling drinks, he spilled a lemonade all over my brother in law. All in all not a great experience.

He just said sometimes we get bad bread. We did not even finish the burgers because there was no bun left, it all fell off while eating. The manger said we can cook you another one and I did not want to wait it was busy and it would probably be the same. The manager seemed like he was really new and had no experience.

The really sad truth right now is that even though Red Robin is known for their burgers, you can now get a much, much better burger (that's also cheaper) at Denny's! Don't get me wrong, when you get a decent server, the bottomless stake fries and bottomless root beer floats are cool, but the burgers are just plain pathetic.

Today my waitress kept forgetting what we ordered, poured water into our sprite, when we asked for more fries she said ""oh you're good?"" then walked off, she was out of it. Onto the positive stuff!

Natalie O.,"Albuquerque, NM",362,48,,4.0,12/1/2010,"I love Red Robin. Loved it in Orange County and loved it in Las Vegas. When I moved to ABQ, I was happy to see that Red Robin was here as well - although there are only two locations and both are a distance from my house. At any rate, I had a craving so we trekked to this location.  Ah, the oh so wonderful BBQ Chicken Wrap, without the BBQ sauce (go figure) and the bottomless fries with ranch dressing. It was yummy and just what I wanted. Oh, did I mention the Diet Cherry Coke? It felt like home and reminded me of all the great times with great friends at the various Red Robins in CA.  I almost forgot to mention the cupcakes. Chocolate, vanilla and strawberry lemonade. I took home one of each so I could write a comprehensive review. The frosting on all three was creamy with the right amount of sweetness. The chocolate cake was a bit dry but there was chocolate in the middle. The vanilla cake was moist and also had cream in the middle. The strawberry lemonade - my favorite - was fantastic. Moist with strawberry cream in the middle and a great flavor. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately for my weight and wallet) we will not be visiting Red Robin often. It is simply too far from Downtown and there are too many other restaurants to visit.

Migsy O.,"Albuquerque, NM",10,70,,4.0,2/1/2012,"This is a great place to come with kids, especially on Wednesdays, when they have free face painting, a balloon man who cruises the tables with his uncanny ability to make whatever object you desire out of balloons, and the big red bird himself.  When my siblings come to visit with my nieces and nephews, there is no easier and friendlier place to take the brood.  Here they can yell and whine, get out of their chairs to wander the restaurant, and exhibit all other manner of inappropriate public behavior, and no one is disturbed! Everyone else is occupied with their own unruly crew, and the noise level is such that it would take a lot to pierce the din. Ahhh, Red Robin.  Normally I eschew corporate dining establishments.  In most chain restaurants, the food is shipped in frozen and premade, the environment is too brightly lit and artificial, and the service tends to be canned and delivered by generally indifferent teenagers. Red Robin certainly does not wander off this beaten path.  But what about that tower of golden onion rings, deep-fried to perfection, served with an ungodly good  barbeque-mayo concoction? That bottomless basket of steak fries? And the burgers? In full disclosure, I am a vegetarian.  And let me tell you, Red Robin serves a profoundly gratifying veggie burger.  I try to eat primarily healthy, whole foods, I really do.  But sometimes a person just wants a veggie patty smothered with onion straws, sautéed mushrooms and blue cheese.  Served on a soft, white bun with a side of fried stuff.  It's bad for you and delicious, and I've learned to stave off the self-loathing with gentle reminders that there are more important things in the world to worry about than the size of my ass. I give Red Robin 4 stars while judging it against its competitors, which in my mind are other chain restaurants and burger joints.  The kids are fed and entertained, which allows the fully grown among us time to relax and enjoy our under-poured, over-priced, artificially-colored cocktails while talking shit and reaching for (this time I mean it) that last fry.  God damn, it's good to be an American!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque?start=60
