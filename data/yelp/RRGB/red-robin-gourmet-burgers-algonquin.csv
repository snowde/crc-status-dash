Michelle T.,"Melrose Park, IL",28,2,1,5.0,12/21/2015,My friend and I came out for lunch. Our server Jay  was new. I think he said it was his second. Very friendly and welcoming. We wanted to share our burgers so he so kindly got out burgers cut in half so we could share. We ordered the whiskey bbq burger and a bacon cheeseburger. We asked for it to be a little pink but we ended up getting well done. Not a big deal because it was delicious regardless. We asked for a box and he got me a side of fries to go. Next time I'm in the area we will be back. Great experience. Great good!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin?start=20

J D.,"Woodstock, IL",7,93,8,3.0,6/13/2014,"Burgers really are great; Big, tasty, cooked right, lots of choices (too many if you have difficulty making up your mind). Many chicken breast sandwich choices too, along with some regular sandwiches and wraps. Lots of appetizer and side choices (including the almost irresistible onion ring ""tower""). A few soups. More choices on the kid's menu than most places. ... and some interesting beverage choices, such as ""adult"" shakes. Yum! Prices ... umm ... You do see the ""Gourmet"" in ""Red Robin Gourmet Burgers,"" right? Not shocking, but it's not cheap eats. The decor is ... bar, plus a section over there for tables. Nothing special, unless you like dining at places that emphasize the bar (not really an issue but ... just sayin'). Service has always been great, quick, friendly and efficient. If you want a heckuva burger, sandwich, or wrap (and you're not on a tight budget), definitely recommended.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin?start=20

Alyssa K.,"Lindenhurst, IL",84,294,67,4.0,11/4/2013,"My boyfriend and I visited here for a late lunch on a Sunday.  We had just finished a bike ride in the cold and we needed some coffee to warm up.  The server brewed us a nice fresh pot which was appreciated.  Since it was a football Sunday, the servers were all wearing football jersey's from their favorite teams, which I thought was a neat idea.  I haven't been to Red Robin for at least a year, but I forgot how expansive the menu is.  Yes, they are a burger place, but there are so many other options.  We ended up going with the Philly Cheesesteak and the prime rib sandwich.  The food was delicious and of course the bottomless fries are always a perk. Our server was great and the food service was fast.  I think Red Robin is a great place for a casual meal with good food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin?start=20
Mike C.,"Algonquin, IL",0,15,,2.0,4/3/2015,"Well my first visit after the remodel.   They concentrated on image over substance.   The place looks great, the staff is nice.  But the food indefinably took a turn for the worse. I ordered the ""Bacon Guacamole"" burger, regular fries and a side of coleslaw.   Lets start with the good.  The coleslaw was quite good.  Fresh, not drowned in mayo, it had a good balance of components, was light and enjoyable.   The fries too were good, not the best I ever had, but pretty tasty. Now the bad.   The burger.  Come on... this is a ""Gourmet Burger"" place,  what I received would not pass for a Wendy's $4 burger.  Oddly dry, not overcooked, just dry.   I opened the bun to have a look and the patty looked like it came from frozen.   Pre-processed, formed, pressed and oddly grey in color.   I had one paper thin, sad looking slice of tomato,  a transparent glaze of what was supposed to be cheese, one slice of bacon (the tastiest part of the sandwich) and nothing else.    But wait... where is my guacamole??   Well closer inspection (much closer) showed a green tint to the upper bun.   REALLY!  Just a smear of green color that imparted no flavor at all.    Color me  gravely disappointed.  $15 for this meal was not worth it.  Gourmet it is not. Next time I'll spend half that amount and get a better burger next door at Wendy's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin?start=20
Michael H.,"Woodstock, IL",33,67,,5.0,1/17/2015,"What can I say about this amazing burger joint? I love the burgers. I never heard of Red Robin until I tried it out for the first time after moving in the area in 2007. This location was the first of many times is eat here. Definitely a good place to hang with friends while enjoying their amazing food. I should mention how they offer bottomless fries, or unlimited (sounds better). I can't get enough of the fries. The fact that they have plenty of burger options makes it seem a little difficult to order. But it's not that bad. The staff are friendly. It's a good place to bring the kids or hang as a group. I just passed by this location recently and noticed from the outside that there was some renovation done. I'd like to see what's new inside. It's been a while since I've had a Red Robin burger, but I'll be back soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin?start=20
Kurtis A.,"Clarksville, TN",4,10,4,4.0,1/15/2016,"My party of 10 had a fairly long wait to get seated. After a large party left on this Friday night feast, my large party took there table. The table was clean and we were quickly served. We all ordered chicken or burgers. The burgers that were cooked ""no pink"" were very dry, which was disappointing for those who ordered ""no pink"". I personally thought that my ""some pink"" burger was cooked to perfection. The biggest complaint we had as a party is the lack of personal service. The machines placed on each table are capable can take orders, bring your receipt, and give you the ability to contact your waitress to demand a refill. Although the technology is incredible, it takes away the satisfaction of being served. I hate to say it, but I almost feel that the ""average tip of 15%"" is not needed when the machine does all the work. The only job the waitress does is bring you drinks, otherwise the men who work in the kitchen bring you your food. It's just very strange to me. More customer service would have made this review a 5 Star, until that happens this Red Robin will be a 4 Star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin?start=20

Donna H.,"Crystal Lake, IL",0,9,,2.0,9/13/2015,"I usually only post good reviews, but I am tired of getting cold fries from a place that prides itself on bottomless fries.  Quick making them so far ahead of people ordering them that when they are served they are cold, limp and not as tasty as they are when freshly made.  You do a disservice to your customers wanting to return.  Today I ordered them as carryout because I have found in the past that is one way I can pretty much guarantee them being made fresh - well not true today they were a bitter disappointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin?start=20
Amber F.,"McHenry, IL",30,42,,2.0,5/11/2014,"Visited yesterday late afternoon for dinner with a couple friends.  We walked in and were seating right away. To the table right next to the hostess stand that we waited for the bus boy to wipe down the table and seats.  I don't know why the hostess took us to a table that had JUST been cleared off when I saw plenty of empty booths and tables throughout the restaurant but she did.  So we sat down to WET SEATS and a WET TABLE.  I wanted to order a drink but they did not have the drink menu like they did at the other tables (the one that stays at the table) so I asked for one.  When I received a drink menu the pages STUCK TOGETHER WITH STICKINESS.  I don't know why the hostess not the waitress didn't notice this as the front and back were also sticky but they didn't.  It was disgusting.  When the waitress noticed this, after I made a comment to my friend to just turn the pages by the edges (to avoid as much stickiness as possible), she quickly apologized and took to back to the hostesses (who were gathered chit-chatting to each other) and brought us back one that looks rarely opened.  She apologized again and said that it was unacceptable. The food was fine for what I knew it would be.  Nothing that I didn't expect already and no complaints on that front.  I just really couldn't get past the seating they gave us and the sticky menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin?start=20

The kids love it because they always get a balloon, and the mac and cheese is bottomless.  I like it because the food is always good. The burgers are cooked and seasoned right, and consistent. The fries are bottomless and the seasoning at the table.. good stuff on the fries. I always order tarter sauce to go with my fries. The tarter sauce is a dill sauce and is awesome!

Brian F.,"Lake in the Hills, IL",337,183,285,4.0,1/28/2017,"Our family comes here a few times a year. If you're a member of the free rewards program, you get a free burger on your birthday. On this occasion, we came because we were in the mood for the Cobb salad, dubbed here as the Avo-Cobb-O. The portion is large, and at over $10, it had better be! The fresh avocado with the bacon and bleu cheese is a killer combo. What really stood out is that when we let the server know that we were splitting the salad, they actually prepared two separate plates for us! If you've split a salad before, you know that it can get messy and hard to make sure the ratios are even. Yes, salad OCD, I know. My father thinks the burgers are overpriced, but I think it comes with the portion size and the unique combinations. My favorites have been the Royal, and the Chili Chili, though I have had almost every single one. I don't recommend any soups, but I do recommend one of the amped up sauces for your fries. I like the garlic aioli.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin

Robyn W.,"Waukegan, IL",74,14,1,1.0,3/10/2017,WORST RED ROBIN I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!!!! you'd have a better lunch starving than eating here!  1st we went on a Saturday afternoon so we expected it to be busy. We sat at the bar no biggie. The first thing I notice is the glasses they are serving us out of we're dirty and have terrible water spots all over and this wasn't just us it was every glass the bartender used.  We order the food was alright definitely nothing to write home about but I also got the most basic thing a wedge salad and my friend got some burger with an egg on it. But what I couldn't help but notice while sitting at the bar is how dirty this place is. And not to mention I didn't have silverware for 10mins after getting my meal.

Kayla R.,"Crystal Lake, IL",4,83,,3.0,10/3/2016,"I come to Red Robin maybe once every 2 or 3 years and it's honestly not that impressive. I'm a simple eater, so I ordered the original cheeseburger. It was cooked beautifully but that pickle relish RUINED the whole thing for me. Doesn't look or taste like pickles at all, and very overpowering. The fries are amazing and definitely worth getting seconds or thirds, but next time I come here, I'm going to ask for no pickle relish. I think the burger would've been a high B, low A without it. Also, on the day that I went, all of the kegs were broken so no draft beer was served. Additionally, the bill for two people was just over $30 without tip-- two burgers, two Cokes, and one Corona. Overall, decent burger place. Expensive by my standards, but seems like a cool date night place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin
Great Reviewer C.,"Wheaton, IL",4,17,3,1.0,5/20/2017,"If there was a zero this is what I would give this place. We ordered food and it was totally wrong when delivered. The next table had the same issue.  Then, after waiting over 30 min, we get the check, they overcharged us for the incorrect meals. They already ran our card, so insisted on giving us a gift card to cover the difference. Why can't they just refund our money.  So, we go back to use the GC, and decide to sit at the bar since it was busy. Guess what? The food was incorrect, again! It's not rocket science to order a burger. What a joke, and what a mistake. No refills were offered on food, fries or drinks and we had to wait 17 min just for the bartender to run the check. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin

Despite being on the kids' menu, it was extremely small and over half my plate was French fries -- which I wouldn't have minded if we had not already been served bottomless French fries as an appetizer. Freckled lemonade was decent. They have a can of their signature seasoning at each table and I definitely recommend adding it to French fries for an additional kick of flavor.

Michael W.,"Lake in the Hills, IL",89,260,51,2.0,11/12/2015,"What do I say, this place is very family friendly and I do like their burgers. The menu has changed since they went to a RR Corporate Restaurant but the service has really gone downhill. The last time we were there they had this new table device called Robin; at first I thought it was going to be great but after 5-10 minutes I felt it was just another way to be ignored.  My wife ordered sweet potato fries and she received a small order with her meal but she was told she could request more; it was not until we were done with the meal that the second batch came. I have been coming here for around 10 years; if you asked me today if the food and service are better then when I first came I would say definitely not. This appears to be another instance of a chain that builds up a loyal following by great service and food and then tries to milk it by poorer service and poorer quality food; they will go the way of others and eventually stop existing. The menu has become much more expensive in the past few years and it is no longer an option when you want an inexpensive family meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin

Or at least I thought I didn't. I tasted them and they neither tasted nor smelled like garlic, so I asked for a redo. I got what would pass for garlic fries, but was in reality just garlic salt a sprinkle of parmesan (for looks?) and their regular seasoning. Not worth the up charge.

Tim N.,"Lake in the Hills, IL",0,67,1,2.0,5/6/2016,Received a RR gift card recently. Which is why we returned. I had a grilled chicken sandwich. The chicken that supplied the meat must have been from a chicken concentration camp. Small and paper thin. One unfresh slice of tomato the size of a silver dollar. One wilted piece of lettuce. The bun was normal size though. So that was going good for me. When asked how my meal was I responded. The manager was soon at our table following up. He discounted our meal or something. Which was nice. If we went back I'm certain nothing will have changed. Hard to believe this place went from being so good to so bad. I found out this particular RR went from being privately owned to corporate owned and everything made sense. I think the former manager (who led this RR like Patton led the 3rd Army) is now managing BWW across the parking lot.   Guess which place moved up the list when RR moved down?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin

nicole h.,"Cary, IL",37,247,,4.0,8/9/2010,"My husband and I sing the song to each other and we just start salivating--he goes, ""Reeeeed Robin!""  To which I reply, ""Yuuuum!""  You've seen the commercials. I know, I know.  It's a chain.  But MAN do I love me some Red Robin.  And this location in particular is my favorite.  I swear all the people who work here are on Prozac. Their positivity is contagious.  My husband eats all the beefy burgers and, for me, their Gardenburger is one the best I've ever had.  Their onion ring stack is delightful.  But we never even get the onion rings because if you order the burgers with the bottomless fries they toss you a basket of steak fries to munch on while you're waiting.  Who wouldn't love that?! Get on their email list and they'll send you a free burger for your birthday.  We allllways go for our birthdays :)  ""Yuuum!""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin?start=40

M L.,"Huntley, IL",0,33,,2.0,5/1/2014,"Ordered a whiskey river salad and it came WITHOUT the BBQ sauce and WITH a small piece of clear plastic in it.  Then the fries arrived cold.  I didn't complain to the server but he was nice.  We were there about 6 years ago and had a ""meh"" experience then as well.  Probably not a place we'd visit again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin?start=40
Laura B.,"Chicago, IL",37,43,2,3.0,1/18/2009,"The food is decent and reasonably priced. The servers are friendly and quick. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE UNLESS YOU WANT TO HAVE 5,000 SCREAMING CHILDREN RUINING YOUR DINNER. If you're ok with noise, non-stop screaming, yelling and kids running amok without any parental supervision, then you won't mind Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin?start=40
Kathie C.,"Woodstock, IL",8,61,2,4.0,4/14/2011,A favorite for the whole family.  Good variety from artery clogging to veggie burgers to salads.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin?start=40
Tracy K.,"Chicago, IL",115,487,51,4.0,12/25/2006,"I'm not a big burger person.. but I love the burgers here, the veggie versions, anyway.   The amount of options they offer is staggering, and every one that I have tried was awesome.  My favorite is the Bonzai Burger.. mmm.. pineapple & teriyaki sauce plus the usual fixings piled so high that I have to strategize a way to fit it in my mouth.  Their stackable onion rings are tasty, and the presentation is kinda fun.   And like Joe said, the fries are bottomless, so there is no way you're going home hungry from here.     The service is usually pretty quick here, and they're relatively friendly.  Plus, they serve alcohol.. making this a great place to meet up for a burger and a beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin?start=40

Joe Z.,"Algonquin, IL",23,194,62,5.0,2/6/2006,"I never thought burgers could taste so good.  I think I've tried almost every single one on the menu, though it's hard to stray from the burgers to try their chicken and other menu items.  fries are bottomless, so you'll never go home hungry.  prices are very reasonable too ($7-$9), and the strawberry lemonade is so dam good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin?start=40
Franklin D.,"Indianapolis, IN",360,781,166,3.0,4/20/2007,"Love it, even though it's a ""chain"" restaurant.  This place gets very crowded around the peak meal times to the point where you have to park next door in the Aldi's lot.  My favorite is the bleu cheese burger (forget the proper name) and the bottomless fries rule even though I can't finish more than seconds. The kids absolutely love the place. Always free baloons, small section with arcade games, and a full bar ""just in case"". It's not uncommon for there to be several kids having a birthday meal in there on any given evening. You can usually slide out of there for about $10-$15 a person, including dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin?start=40
TJ P.,"Chicago, IL",1,7,,4.0,6/20/2012,Great food here. The waiter/waitress makes at least 1 mistake EVERY time we come here. But it does not take much away from the meal. Good location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin?start=40
Liz B.,"Lake in the Hills, IL",68,172,20,4.0,2/15/2010,"My son and I had our date here yesterday. The whole atmosphere is very kid friendly; arcade games, balloons, activity books, etc.. Our waitress was very nice and did a great job. Sad to say, I didn't get a burger. I know, I know, but I just wasn't in the mood. Instead, I got the fish tacos. They were pretty tasty and very filling. Each of the three tacos contained two pieces of fried cod, slaw, salsa, and tartar sauce. My son got the kids cheeseburger and fries. My kid is known as a very slow eater, but he wasn't there! He ate everything in his meal. I was very impressed, and he said it was delicious. My date and I left with full bellies, two balloons, and a couple smiles. We've added a new place to our date repertoire.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin?start=40
Mike T.,"Streamwood, IL",6,58,14,4.0,2/22/2010,"We have only been to Red Robin a few times and never to this one before. We went on a late Saturday afternoon for an early dinner and it was great. The customer service at this place needs to be commended. Not once were our drinks empty. There was always someone coming by to check up on us, whether it be our server or a manger. It was great. The food is good, it took a little while to get the food though. Our server apologized for the delay and brought us out fries before our dinner came. Overall, the burgers here are very good and filling and most important..the customer service is fantastic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin?start=40
Brandon J.,"Crystal Lake, IL",0,9,,5.0,5/17/2008,"Love the ""innovative"" burgers on the menu.  THe burger with egg and bacon is fire!  Far from your traditional ""Chicago Burger"" but great nonetheless.

K S.,"Cary, IL",1,40,11,5.0,8/19/2008,"I always get the Whiskey River BBQ burger because I can't tear myself away from it. My friends all told me to get the Bleu Cheese burger. One night I was particularly hungry so I ordered both. The Bleu Cheese burger was extremely good, but I was glad I got both burgers, because the BBQ Burger is just unreal. Best chain burger in this area. The only other burgers that I like better are at the Tracks in Cary, Duke's in Crystal Lake, DC Cobbs in Woodstock and the Cottage in Crystal Lake. Red Robin is better with kids in tow than the pub/grill type places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin?start=60
