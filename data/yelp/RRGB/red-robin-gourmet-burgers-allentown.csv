Sherry M.,"Emmaus, PA",75,15,9,1.0,8/5/2017,Worst service ever! Only five seated at the bar and he couldn't check on us. Fries were under cooked burgers over cooked. Didn't get a check back until we were completely done. I guess tge two minute two bite rule doesn't apply at RR?! Ordered sauce on side sauce was on the burger. Needed dipping sauce for the onion straws. NOPE! NEVER EVER again will I spend my money there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown
Kelsey M.,"Emmaus, PA",68,86,93,2.0,6/19/2016,"tl;dr: food was eh/alright; service was just *so* slow Normally, I'm a fan of the chain. There's one in my hometown that's amazing and certainly a solid 4 stars because of the service and quality of food.  This Red Robin, not so much. The food was alright. I ordered the bruschetta chicken sandwich, a dish that I've had elsewhere at other Red Robins. It alright but not as much flavor as it normally has and a little saltier than normal. The fries had kind of an off taste to them from what I am used to. The ice tea I ordered was a little watery. Overall, it wasn't terrible but not great either. But the food isn't what's killing the review (it's actually what kept it from a 1-star-review). The service was definitely sub-par. The hostess was nice and we were seated at our table quickly, but things went downhill once our waiter came to the table. The service by the waiter was just so slow and I don't get why because it wasn't packed and with the amount of people on shift, the place hardly looked short-staffed.  Now you might think I am exaggerating how slow he was (time can move slowly when you're waiting) but I had the Cavalier/Warriors playoffs game blaring at me from three different a TVs in the background serving as my meter of time (and this game just really stuck with me). It went something like: 7:55ish (before the game is on ESPN): seated at table, waiter takes drink orders. 8:15ish (tip-off already happened; game underway): waiter comes back with the ice tea and water we ordered (20 minutes for that?); takes food order.  8:20ish (warriors just came back from a timeout to score a 3): appetizer comes. The food actually comes out pretty quick.  8:26ish (warriors and Cavs tied): food comes out. Again, food came quickly.  8:27ish (taken maybe two or three bites of food): server checks in to see if the food is good.  And here's where the waiter basically forgets about us.  8:40ish (first quarter has ended): I'd been hoping to get a refill for about 5 minutes. Don't see waiter anywhere.  8:46ish (warriors score a bunch in a row because the table next to us is happy): give up on getting a refill because I'm done with my food but hoping to get a box.  8:55ish (warriors were behind and just got back in the lead): waiting for the check and just want a box. My friend and I remember we can pay on the computers on the tables but doesn't solve box dilemma. Still no waiter (or really any waiter who's attention we can call.)  8:56ish: notice ""call server"" button on computer. Press. 9:05ish (Cavs are starting to close the gap on the warriors lead): I was just about ready to get up and rifle through the waiters' supply stand when the waiter comes back. He apologized half-heartedly for not checking back sooner because he was making drinks.  Perhaps he was having a bad day? I don't know. Service jobs are hard and often thankless jobs, but tonight was not his night for service. Nearly 40 minutes between check-ins is just way too long.  I'm so bummed to give Red Robin a bad review because I really do like the chain. But this location just wasn't good.  Maybe 2 stars is too generous?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown
Donita C.,"Northampton, PA",115,79,16,3.0,12/12/2016,"Went on a Sunday night around 7pm, not very busy, so I was seated and attended to immediately. Started with a bowl of New England chowder and ordered a plain cheeseburger, prepared medium a.k.a. With some pink according to their menu, with bottomless steak fries. The soup was meh, very liquidy and the potatoes were just shy of being tender. Like it wasn't stirred from the bottom before serving.  I did use some of the cracked pepper from the grinder on the table, that grinder is amazing! Nicely coarse black pepper!  That was the highlight of that soup. It was served with two slices of crusty bread that I think we're supposed to be garlic toast. Two bites of that was enough for me. The burger came before I had finished my soup (I really hate that).  I tasted a fry immediately before they got cold. It was hot, yes. Finished soup, started in on the burger.  It had no pink, but it was not dry at least. Server did offer to have it remade but I just wanted to eat.  (Applebees does this all the time too, no pink when you ask.) The burger was average, nothing to rave about. I liked they were generous with the cheese and it was seasoned properly. Pretty large patty, I only ate a little more than half of it. The fries tasted better with the seasoning they have on the table, but even though the fries were not burned and had crunch, they were very dry on inside. I suspect they were sitting under a heat lamp. I think I ate only 8 of them and when I was asked if I needed more, I declined.  Their fries have potential to be kick butt if their fresh, I bet, especially with that seasoning (they also have salt grinder on the table). All in all, typical chain food, always meets my average expectations.  My bill was about $24 with tip. Dang. Won't get a burger there anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown
Amy C.,"Whitehall, PA",1,23,8,1.0,12/27/2016,"Awful. First time going there, will never go back. Ordered medium rare burger, waitress said ok. Food comes out, it's way over done. She doesn't come back for 20 minutes, and I tell her it's over cooked. She just says they don't do medium rare there, only ""some pink"" ...Why would you not tell me that when I ordered it? I wouldn't have gotten a burger then. No apology, no fixing it. Fries were cold, too. So it was basically like throwing $30 away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown
Zachary P.,"Bethlehem, PA",6,15,1,5.0,6/15/2017,"Me and my family went to this Red Robin yesterday and had a great experience! Our food was out in a reasonable amount of time and everything we ordered was great! I got a Bacon Cheeseburger, which I would highly recommend to anybody. We visited while the restaurant was being remodeled, but that did not affect our experience in any way. I was a bit disappointed however to find out that the TVs that used to be built into the floor for customers to watch while waiting to be seated, had been taken out, but that's alright since we came for food and not TVs! Parking is great, so there is no need to worry about that! Signs will direct you to exit and enter the property using Airport Road since Airport Road can be a bit difficult to get across in certain areas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown
Dee L.,"Lehigh Valley, PA",1,30,,1.0,5/7/2017,"This restaurant has steadily been going downhill over the past six months and after today's visit,  we are through after being customers for more than 5 years. The restaurant is simply too cheap to hire the help it needs to respond to customers and one bartender today had to cover more than half a dozen tables. We were served warm ""iced"" tea because Red Robin obviously couldn't have any kitchen staff come in 30 minutes prior to opening to ensure the iced tea was ready to serve. We waited 15 minutes for the check and spent almost 80 minutes for a lunch in which only entrees were ordered. The fried clams were overcooked and inedible and our order was missing the promised cole slaw which we had to ask for. The restaurant has been ""redecorating"" for over a month and it looks like crap. Spend your money elsewhere!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown

Christopher C.,"Conshohocken, PA",168,1318,6419,3.0,8/3/2013,"We got here mid-afternoon and were seated right away as things were fairly quiet. Made the mistake of starting with the pretzel bites.  Five dollars for a microscopic cup of dipping cheese along I think ten very ""bite sized"" pretzels.  It's no wonder on the promo material they choose to not show the price.  If they did who would order it? We did a burger and some sort of chicken parm-type pasta dish. The burger was the limited time Berzerker that they're pushing and our server did a horrible job explaining that this thing packs some pretty serious heat.  Just saying ""it's a little hot"" does not begin to describe the spicy aioli on this thing. The pasta dish was alright although the outer coating on the chicken was fried really, really hard.   The service was alright.  We never waited too long for drink refills although our server couldn't be bothered to remove any dirty dishes and things piled up at the end to the point of having no space on the table. They sort of try to push the little console on the table to order apps, drinks, desserts from along with paying to play games, music, apps and who knows what else but we didn't bother with it because in all honesty the tables are too small and it mostly was in the way the entire time so we didn't use it out of spite. I see after fifteen reviews this place is sporting three stars.   All things considered, that's about spot on. If you look in the dictionary under the word average, I'm pretty sure that places like Red Robin, Crapplebees, Ruby Tuesday and their offshoots all make an appearance. What this place boils down to is average service with average decor along with average food.  If you want your palette challenged or intrigued this is not where you want to come.  If you want something that's quasi-quick, mindless and easy then this is for you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown?start=20

I ordered a burning love with the chipotle sauce IN the burger, but vince manages to fuck it up as well. Just when I thought he couldn't fuck anything else, he mixed up everyone's order. He gave my Burger to someone else and someone else's Burger to me. I had to wait forever for Vince to bring my refill of coke float. Then I spoke with the manager.

Captain B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",6,119,2,1.0,5/30/2016,"I'm giving this place 1 star because the bartender was a nice guy. It was right next to the hotel so it was convenient. I have never been to a Red Robin before so I thought I would give it a go. Sure it's a ""gourmet"" burger place, but we don't have enough of these around these days (sarcasm). Anyway I orderered the prime chop, sounds fancy, and I ordered it medium rare. It came out medium well. So I figured I would just wait till the bartender stopped by and asked how my burger was. He never asked, as a matter of fact after I received my food he never asked me anything, refilled my water or even tried to sell me anything. So no point in complaining. I just ate the overcooked burger and paid my bill (which I had to ask for) and left. To the bartenders credit it was a busy holiday (har har) with two other patrons at the bar. My main question to restauranteurs is: how is there no check and balance when one person puts in medium rare and the ""gourmet burger chef"" cooks it medium well? I recall the movie ""Waiting"" when the lady says ""how hard is your job, how intelligent do you have to be to take a food order?"".

I am absolutely obsessed with the whiskey river bbq chicken sandwich, and that's all I ever get. I try to break away and try other things, but in the end that sandwich always seems to win out. friend got a milkshake, and we ordered an appetizer of zucchini sticks and jalapeno coins. they were great, though I was paying for those coins the next day lol. anyway, entrees came out, his burger was great. my sandwich.. im not sure what happened. I picked it up and a river of grease came out of it. I don't mean a few drops, I mean a river that filled my plate. since its a chicken sandwich im not really sure where it came from.. my only guess could be the fried onion straws they put on it. I was able to eat almost half of it before it completely disintegrated and I couldn't stomach it. in all the years and all the red robins, including this one, never had that happen before. so why the 5 stars? well our very friendly waitress came to check on us just as I was trying to clean my hands off and I mentioned and pointed out the grease. she was extremely apologetic and was offering me a new sandwich, or something else off the menu to make up for it. I politely declined, as I had indeed eaten half of this one, not a few bites.. and I wouldn't have been able to eat a sandwich and a half. she really tried to right it but I didn't think it was a huge deal. a few minutes later the manager came over and asked about it and again offered me another sandwich, or even one to take home. I politely declined again, and instead opted to just get a little dessert. he then took that sandwich off our bill! they didn't have to do that, and I really think it shows the good service they have. ill still go back for my whiskey river bbq sandwich, and awesome fries, i think this was just a weird fluke of a bad sandwich.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown?start=20

My girlfriend and I wanted somewhere that had a decent hamburger, and since these are considered ""gourmet"" I thought we could check it out. We were ushered in by a pair of teenagers to a small table that felt like it was crammed right into the middle of a walkway. The table was small for 2 people; even smaller thanks to the flair. The drinks menu, Red Robin seasoning and ketchup were all covered in a non-descript stickiness, as if they had been on the table for a while and never cleaned. Waitstaff was attentive but there seemed to be too many of them just milling around.  Atmosphere was loud and it was hard to have a conversation, but easy to hear everyone else as they talked over the din. Beer list is so-so, has the familiar mass produced staples but nothing special.  Appetizer onion rings were indeed fantastic, about the best part of our experience. My girlfriend ordered her burger without the bun, thinking that would not be taken literally and they would wrap it in lettuce. Instead, she got a do-it-yourself hamburger kit, bun not included, complete with shredded lettuce. My burger came as I ordered it, but aside from the jalapenos, it felt rather uninspired. Also, for a ""gourmet"" burger the quality of beef seemed to come up short. For a quick family meal in a chain place that serves middle-of-the-road American food, they do an okay job.

Stephanie K.,"Slatington, PA",18,71,39,4.0,1/26/2015,"This was my first time back at this location in years. We were seated promptly in the bar area (booth) and noticed that the restaurant wasn't that busy. Though the bartender was swamped. After about 5 minutes of us sitting there she came out for our drink order and disappeared. The manager walked by our table numerous times (I think his name was Tony) and kept looking at our blank empty table. Well 15 minutes later our drinks came out, Mai Tai, 2 berry moscato's (I think) and I had the freckled lemonade  - I was the DD. The alcoholic beverages came out first and mine didn't come out for another 5 minutes! So we are now 30 minutes in and getting our drinks, as soon as she put our drinks down we ordered our food. The food came out at a pretty quick speed, the presentation of the bruchetta burger I ordered was very gross and it didn't look appetizing. But I've eaten it before, so I know that it taste fantastic. We ordered bottomless fries right away, those came out about 6 minutes later, fresh from the fryer. We all loved our food (hence the 4 stars), but the Mai Tai was too strong, which we told the bartender and she took it off our bill. All in all this was one of the better experiences I have had, but the timing was so off. People at the bar got drinks way before we ever did and we were there longer.

The hostess was actually trying to negotiate with me, she asked if a table section in those long rows where like 20 people can sit next to each other would be ok. I said I'd just prefer a larger booth. She said ok and took me to one of those table sections anyway. I should have just walked out then. I sat down anyway. It was not overly busy and there were four booths in my line of sight that I would have preferred to sit. Those booths were empty the whole time I was there. Please tell me Red Robin what is the deal with your seating procedures. It may not matter to some people but it does me. I am done pleading, begging and negotiating to get the table I want.   If you can't tell, this is not the 1st time this has happened at RR.  It's one of many, but today was my breaking point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown?start=20
M G.,"Bethlehem, PA",0,16,,2.0,3/14/2015,They are known for their fries and the fries were undercooked and mushy.  I have also noticed an overall lack of the quality of the good.  Used to be one of our favorite chains however we will be looking elsewhere.  Good quality has decreased and fresh healthy options are limited.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown?start=20
Kamil P.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,,3.0,1/25/2015,Weird experience. Server was great. Thats the only plus. We had a smoke & pepper burgers. The meat tasted like turkey or something. The beacon was flavorless. And the price tag of $13+. Joke! Not comming back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown?start=20

Lauri Y.,"Charlotte, NC",10,9,,1.0,12/5/2012,Decided to go and grab a burger.  We were immediately seated.  We waited 10 mins before we were approached by ANYONE!  Our presence wasn't acknowledged one time.   Customers should always be greeted by waitress/waiter quickly after they're seated!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown?start=40
Kyle S.,"Bethlehem, PA",12,76,5,3.0,2/28/2010,"For a decent ""specialty"" burger, Red Robin is pretty good.  They've got 20-30 different types of burgers, with various different toppings, and several chicken sandwich options as well.  Every sandwich comes with unlimited fries, which is pretty nice. Burgers aren't the best I've had, but they're decent.  I ordered a BBQ burger last time I was here and asked for it medium, but when it came out it was well done, which was disappointing.  There wasn't really enough barbecue sauce either. That being said, if you're in the mood for an above average burger with some interesting toppings, check out Red Robin.  If you just want your standard greasy burger, Five Guys (which is right nearby) is better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown?start=40
Diesel H.,"Milford, NJ",57,472,197,4.0,9/4/2012,"first red robin experience ever. it was pretty good - its a chain resturant so same menu as applebees, ruby tuesday ect.  It was yummy.

Kris G.,"Allentown, PA",35,134,65,3.0,10/21/2011,"I usually visit the other loation in the valley but my BFF and I were running an errand up there and she had a birthday coupon for a free burger.  I haven't been here when it is busy but I like that they have a minutes to wait counter hanging in the window.  Our service was good, the burger was good.  I still think the food at the Tilghman Street one is better.  The outdoor space at this location is awful.  It is right up against airport road, yuck.  I wish they would have just made the restaurant bigger.  Also I feel like the booths are smaller, I felt cramped sitting there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown?start=40
Scott H.,"Bethlehem, PA",13,26,,1.0,12/18/2009,"Although I love Red Robin in general, the one on Airport Rd. has been a horrible experience on several different occasions that we have tried it.  We now generally drive out to Nazareth when we want to go to RR. The atmosphere at this particular location is just not as comfortable as either the one in Allentown or Nazareth.  It seems more cramped and uncomfortable. It also always seems to be very loud.   However, the largest problem is the extremely slow service - if you happen to get it at all.   On our last visit, we were seated immediately but finally got up and left after no waiter or waitress ever showed up to give us service.  We simply walked out.   When we were exiting they thanked us for visiting and we told them we were just leaving because we were never served.  The manager was there and heard us, so he offered to give us dinner on them, but we just left as it was just another bad experience at that particular location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown?start=40

Brian L.,"Philadelphia, PA",94,356,295,4.0,7/19/2009,"There's a soft spot in my heart for this place.  Throughout the years at LU a couple friends and I would occasionally come out for a gathering here and have dinner.  The prices aren't too bad and the service has been pretty good.  I never had any bad experiences here.  Even though it's a chain, I find their burgers to be pretty good.  They're ridiculously messy and overloaded...but they always manage to fill me up and satisfy me...though at the end, I always felt overly full after a meal here, especially with their french fries and seasoning.  If I have to choose go-to place for chain burgers, this is it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown?start=40
Edward B.,"Philadelphia, PA",117,13,,3.0,4/26/2010,"As this a chain, i think it is better to rate this place based on my time of Being there.   Here is the play by play for this particular RR: Instantly seated though there was time on the wait time.  Waitress seemed to busy to provide undivided attention.  Got my watered down milkshake. Food gets here and it is great. I got the bleu ribbon burger.  I asked for extra fries and they get to me after i finished my Burger. Same waitress takes no time To get us the check though.  Take what you want from this review but the rating says it all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown?start=40
Ben C.,"South San Francisco, CA",38,98,11,4.0,8/14/2009,"I personally rate each RR seperate in my book as they each have a unique atmosphere.  This is my favorite location, open bright an airy.  The wait sign is a very nice. Food is consistant in all locations, however this location also asks if you want to snack on some fries while you wait for your burgers.  Basically a free appitizer ;-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown?start=40
jace c.,"Coplay, PA",1,29,12,5.0,11/11/2010,"it was a surprise to me to discover a few years ago that Red Robin's has the option to eat vegetarian versions of their burgers. this is great & something they ought to advertise (vegan boca patty or garden burger). when my friends & I get growlingly hungry & need to be filled-up with satisfying comfort food (craving big fat burgers), we head to RR's and fill-up on the typically fresh hot fries (!!) & excellent gormet burgers. if you order a burger with a boca patty, you may wish to request it be ""well done"" but I've never had a problem enjoying it either way (plus, your food will be out faster if you're eating vegetarian instead of meat as it takes less time to cook). Red Robin's was a place I enjoyed before becoming vegetarian & I'm so glad that they are clever enough to cater to vegetarians (I still love burgers!). that's my prime reason for reviewing this place because it seems almost no one is aware that RR is still an option for vegetarian/vegan yummy munching! this particular location has never been a problem for me. the staff are friendly & competent, the restrooms seem clean enough, the music is 80s era so I can escape ""contemporary""  pop radio there... no complaints. the only thing I wish they had was fake bacon! I've considered bringing my own!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown?start=40
Michelle S.,"Holmdel, NJ",0,30,,4.0,12/9/2012,"I've been to this red robin quite a few times. It's gotten better over the past few visits. It seems quieter than it used to be, although that may be due to me going at different times. The food is decent. Your typical burger fare with a few specialty toppings. What brings it up to 4 stars for me is the presence of a gluten free menu the last time I was there. GF is hard to come by in the valley and its a bummer for celiacs who can't just break their diet for a single meal. Their burger bun was really pretty good for gluten free and the selection of allergy sensitive  food options in general made me feel like they are really trying to appeal to anyone who walks through the door. The waiter was very nice and really bent over backwards to make sure the GF thing was done right. It looked like he might have been a manager. In general, the waitstaff is young and you may be left waiting longer than a usual burger joint. But enjoy the atmosphere. There is a lot to look at, and if you aren't insistent on being a typical American (fast foodie), you might actually enjoy a longer meal. If you're in a super rush to eat, you're in the wrong place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown?start=40
