Nancy F.,"Cumberland, MD",0,3,2,5.0,11/17/2017,Love Red Robin! Got the chili chili cheeseburger. ..yum! Red Robin never disappoints.  Love the rewards program!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-altoona
Sarah M.,"Tyrone, PA",0,1,,1.0,1/8/2018,"Absolutely disgusting. The establishment was so dirty that it was unrealistic- table tops greasy, glasses filthy, booths covered in crumbs, etc.. My mother and I came in on a Monday night when there was hardly any customers. And yet, the place was dirty. Makes it seem as if the workers never clean at all. I watched the waitress clean down the table next to us with a dry rag. She brushed all of the piece of food onto the carpeted floor. It's as if they do not even have sanitizer to wipe down the table tops with. When the food came out, the plates were greasy and dirty. I had dried on food stuck to mine. It was as if they hadn't even been washed. To make matters worse, I found a hair sticking out of my burger. Health code violations anyone!?!?!?! Honestly I don't even know how this restaurant is still open. It doesn't even deserve one star. Beware, NASTY!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-altoona
Rick B.,"Altoona, PA",0,28,1,1.0,12/25/2017,This location is a fine example of the wasted youth in the area. Or even the millenials. The food is great and the quality is in the brand. Its the service that lacks severely. These kids have all the sense of entitlement and not one ounce of pride. Go to greensburg if you want a better experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-altoona
Madeline Rose O.,"Kitzmiller, MD",11,1,,1.0,1/6/2018,My fries were cold and the waitress was rude. Didn't say you're welcome and she dropped my box on the table on my food and walked away but I get the struggle so I gave her a 10$ tip and she said thaankss in a sarcastic tone. And she went to another waitress and was clearly talking about us. I didn't say anything about my fries and we were extremely nice,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-altoona
Stephanie L.,"Gallitzin, PA",3,43,14,2.0,6/6/2017,"Gather around children and listen to a tale. We'd heard rumors about the Red Robin in Altoona and decided to investigate. Since they opened a while back and earlier customers found their credit cards with mysterious charges after visiting (that was resolved), we had heard that the only thing more disappointing than the food was the service. The building is easy to find, a little spot with a small footprint and lots of parking, and there were a surprising number of other intrepid explorers on a Saturday afternoon. We were seated quickly by a friendly hostess and then began to watch out for that most elusive of creatures: The Server. After perusing sticky menus, which the chain needs to revamp anyway, there it was! The creature we'd so long waited for! We put in drink orders and took the chance of not ordering alcoholic beverages. We knew that doing so would likely limit another appearance of The Server. Drinks arrived in two trips but we did indeed interact again with The Server and placed a food order.  Food was long in arriving, especially for such simple fare. We persisted, hopeful that The Server would return, to see what we had consumed or to remove the spent plates. Alas after delivering the meals, like the mighty Sasquatch or Yeti, we never laid eyes again upon The Server. We paid via Ziosk in the ensuing silence, weaving between tables across floors even stickier than the menus had been, and left, dodging the longing stares of other hungry patrons still awaiting their food or perhaps to place an order of their own. Alas, with one or maybe two exceptions, The Server(s) were all but extinct. If you have a lot of free time and don't much care about the quality of what you get, I highly recommend The Altoona Red Robin as a place to go Server Spotting. I don't recommend it for the food or service. Pros: Plenty of parking; close to other restaurants when you get fed up and leave. Cons: Service, food, cleanliness. Yikes. BTW: We've been to other Red Robins, which are always fun with good service and tasty food. This isn't a chain issue. It's a unique to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-altoona
Frank F.,"Altoona, PA",0,16,4,4.0,9/11/2017,"Been here many times. The burgers are great. I have had at least a dozen different ones and every one was good. The bottomless fries good whether they are regular or sweet potato and they keep coming as long as you can eat them. This is also one of the few places that will give you a medium rare burger as opposed to well done over cooked.  Substitutions dont seem to be a problem. If you want Swiss cheese on a burger that usually comes with American, just ask. They have always been accommodating.  Oh, don't forget to try the Tower of onion rings. Great appetizer. Yes prices are a little steep for burgers but when you consider what fast food is charging now a days and what you are getting here, it seems worth the difference.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-altoona
Heather H.,"State College, PA",0,2,,1.0,10/13/2017,"I've never actually taken the time to write a review, but thought it necessary to spare others from this restaurant. I only gave it one star because I had to give it something. Terrible service, and the food was even worse. It was the equivalent of a really poor school lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-altoona
Jason S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2,10,2,1.0,9/30/2016,"Sat for 30 min no waitress ever helped, asked multiple, still no help, finally just got up and left. No drinks or anything. Multiple other tables around us were in states of confusion as well. Terrible service, won't be back till they get the service straightened out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-altoona
Jason B.,"State College, PA",0,2,,5.0,12/9/2016,"This is THE place to go to for burgers in central  PA. Veronica, was extremely helpful, accommodating, and delightful. She helped choose the best burgers my friends and I have had in recent history. I normally don't write reviews but I was simply blown away. The wonderful atmosphere just added to the experience. My stomach and I left with a smile, and that's all you can ask for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-altoona
Joseph K.,"Boulder, CO",76,32,,3.0,7/11/2016,"Years ago I came here and I was wowed by the quality of the burgers.  Fast forward to this year and it seems like everyone offers a quality hamburger sandwich.  And I think Red Robin doesn't really hold up. At this particular location we had friendly service, and my dining companions liked their meals, but I wasn't impressed.  Although I got the so-called Prime Chophouse burger that boasted ""horseradish-sauteed"" mushrooms, there wasn't a lot of flavor.  Another issue is the high price of drinks: some 4 dollars for a soft drink! I do like that you can substitute your ""bottomless"" fries for bottomless broccoli or cole slaw.  And one of my companions did like the crab cake burger.  But you might have better options for your burger fix, and at a lower price to boot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-altoona
Judith W.,"Duncansville, PA",0,3,,5.0,12/20/2016,The Best Cheeseburger Ever!! I went for My 12/18 Birthday & plan to go back ASAP!!!!  Love the sweet potato fries too. Very sweet waitress.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-altoona
Emily T.,"Morgantown, WV",74,6,,3.0,12/18/2016,"This Red Robin is very nicely decorated and our waitress was very accommodating, but the fries we ordered ahead were served with our food and the guacamole on my Guacamole Bacon Burger was pretty much nonexistent. I was very disappointed with that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-altoona
Michelle D.,"Allegany, NY",145,8,,2.0,11/5/2016,"Food is fine. Red Robin is always a decent meal, especially with kids. The service at this location, however, is insanely slow. It took forever to get our drinks, food and refills. We ordered dessert for my daughter's birthday and ended up taking it to go. Hire additional staff to keep things moving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-altoona
Kalyn B.,"Rossiter, PA",134,137,63,4.0,2/18/2016,"I love hitting up this Red Robin, and it was way beyond time that Altoona got a Red Robin!  I've visited this place twice so far since it's been open. Both times I've been there, I've been promptly seated. Let me offer some delicious advice: If you go to Red Robin get a burger! You won't regret it, I promise! If Red Robin does one thing extremely well, it's burgers. I'm a huge fan of the Royal Red Robin... A juicy burger with an egg perfectly cooked, right on top. It's delicious. I've also ordered the Pig Out Style Tavern Double burger. It's every bacon lovers dream. Basically, it's a bacon cheeseburger with a bacon aioli... and it is delicious. The best part of it all? Endless fries! Who doesn't love endless fries?! During my second visit, my group and I also ordered the Towering-Dohs! (That's really what they are called!) The Towering-Dohs are a really tasty cross between a doughnut and croissant, coated in sugar, and it comes with chocolate dipping sauce and a raspberry dipping sauce. They are absolutely delicious. The waitstaff has always been friendly...Sometimes a little overly friendly. During my last visit the waitress I had was very nice, maybe a little too friendly. A few times during our visit, she plopped herself into the booth beside me. It was really no big deal. I found it a little humorous, but it was quite unusual.  If you go during the lunch or dinner rush, be prepared for the possibility of having to wait a couple minutes for a table. Also, the noise level may be a bit high during the peak hours. Other than that, it's a wonderful and delicious dining experience for the entire family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-altoona
Randy B.,"Altoona, PA",2,6,,4.0,5/22/2016,"I had a meal there before they officially opened so I'm hoping that it gets better with time, but a place that's supposed too be known for its great burgers...should have great burgers!? The Mac and cheese was also really dry and not creamy at all. Salted caramel milkshake was good though. Getting much better now, this is becoming one of my favorite places to eat at.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-altoona
Alex S.,"Altoona, PA",40,268,69,4.0,2/8/2016,"This is my second time going to Red Robin, first for this location. The hostess seemed a little ditzy, as she forgot our server's name and didn't know what tables were open. Anyway, we've been wanting to try this place again, but waited until now so the cooks and staff could get the kinks worked out. We ordered the pretzel bites with beer cheese dip to start with and they were awesome. My only complaint is that the pretzels had too much salt, but that happens almost any time you get soft pretzels anymore. For my main course, I got the whiskey river barbecue chicken sandwich. There was a little bit too much bread-to-chicken ratio, but again, happens a lot due to varying sizes and shapes of chicken. However, the sauce was good and the bread was nice and buttery. Our waitress wasn't the most personable, but she made sure we had drinks and offered refills on our fries. One of these days I'll have to go back and try one of their milkshakes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-altoona
Shelly S.,"Altoona, PA",48,77,7,3.0,8/1/2016,"This place is hit and miss. The food is good, but I've had better burgers at other places. I like the pretzel appetizer. The service is ok. Honestly, one night we sat for 15 minutes and a server still didn't come over, so we got up and left. The hostess asked us if everything was ok and we said no server came to us. She just said, ""oh"" nothing else as we walked out the door? Then we've had servers who are good and some who were ok. Like I said hit or miss.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-altoona
Jen M.,"Philipsburg, PA",0,22,7,2.0,11/20/2016,"The food itself here is pretty good but the service was horrible.  The server who waited on us couldn't act any less short, rude and uninterested in working there.  I always cut some slack to anyone in this profession because I've been a waitress before and know how difficult it can be at times to please everyone but she was downright nasty to us!  If I go back, I'm going to make sure that we don't get her again and request someone else.  She got our orders wrong, was not apologetic about it, not accommodating what so ever and acted as if we were bothering her just to get a side of ranch!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-altoona
Keith A.,"Spring, TX",0,22,1,1.0,5/4/2016,Walked in and ordered to go for only myself. One freakin person and they weren't slammed busy. 33 minutes later my food comes out. No silverware. No ketchup. No napkins. Manager apologized but gave no reason. My wrap was drowning in bbq sauce and ranch. So much for healthy eating. Fruit cup was small and drowning in syrup. All together gross.

Renee S.,"Ebensburg, PA",3,3,,1.0,11/28/2015,"The place is not that bad .. But the wait sucked ! I gave my # so I could get a text when our table would be ready .. They said a half hour wait ..

Gave our order with in two mins ., and didn't get our food till 6:50 .. We ordered before two other couples they got their food before we did .. And it wasn't bad ..

NIkki S.,"Johnstown, PA",0,25,23,3.0,1/4/2016,"They were busy, we were told approximately 15 minute wait but we're seated in 10.  We were lead to a booth, I slid in, and back out quickly, as my pants got soaked because they had just wipe the bench off.   By the time the waitress noticed is still standing there my husband had dried it with his sweatshirt.  Started out with spinach artichoke dip. While it was good, we found a hair in it so naturally we did not eat anymore and alerted our waitress. The manager came over and asked if we would like a new one we declined, so he removed it from our bill.   The height of the tables seem to be too high it was sort of awkward eating. 3 Office ordered hamburgers two wear to be very well done. Needless to say they were still pink. Halfway through the macaroni and cheese another hair was found, we were all discouraged at this point, simply paid our bill ($62, for burgers, fries, mac n cheese n iced teas) and left.    Will stick to five guys.

Ralf S.,"State College, PA",98,43,7,5.0,1/30/2016,"My wife and I decided to get the two double tavern burgers deal with endless fries. We both chose the Pig Out Bacon burgers. One bite into these juicy dreams and we had to sing it... YUMM!  Our server, Alison, was swift, courteous and friendly and when she brought out the burgers, she reminded us to let her know when we'd like more fries.  Unlike another scalding reviewer, we found no hairs in anything. The burgers were perfect without making any special request. I mean, who wants it cooked to beyond recognition anyway? I like my burger juicy and tasty, not bland and dull as shoe leather. I'm sure we'll stop in again real soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-altoona?start=20
Dan T.,"Altoona, PA",0,6,,2.0,3/22/2016,All of you have to remember that this is Altoona pa and service and food taste is mostly poor wherever you go. Hit a bigger city and you can see and taste the difference.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-altoona?start=20
Miranda R.,"Cresson, PA",40,10,2,3.0,2/23/2016,"Just went here for the first time this past weekend and I have to say that I really enjoyed their burgers and was not disappointed with the food by any means. We were seated at the bar and the bartender was friendly, but I'm not sure that I like how these touch devices are taking over for waiters/waitresses, makes everything feel less atmospheric and I don't know how to tip when I ordered everything on the pad and had to request drink refills, desserts, and paid the check with no interaction. Price was a bit high and I'm not sure that I'd say the burger and fries were better (nor worse) than Five Guys.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-altoona?start=20
Antoinette M.,"Hollidaysburg, PA",0,1,,1.0,5/28/2016,I must say I gave this place a 2nd chance and if I could give no stars I would. Was told I could sit in the bar area with my daughter while I wait on to go food. Well then was told no so my daughter had to go sit outside. The real kicker was when they said we can seat you in the restaurant area. I said OK until I saw a very tiny table with 2 chairs that appeared to be folding chairs right in the center of an already crowded area. I politely said no thanks and even one of the staff said they totally agreed and would have never sat there. Also once again the appetizer was forgotten.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-altoona?start=20
Kelsey L.,"Newry, PA",30,1,,3.0,5/17/2016,"Let me start by saying I've been to other Red Robin locations and I've had fine experiences. This one, however, was not that great. My boyfriend heard terrible things about this location, but I managed to convince him to try it since I had pleasant experiences at other locations. He was sort of right. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the food! He liked his burger that he got and I just went with the crispy chicken sandwich which was okay, nothing special. The bad part was the service! We are both servers ourselves and we can relate and understand a lack of great service if the waitress is busy or something, but she wasn't. We walked in at around 6 on a Monday. After a few minutes of waiting with no one at the front desk, someone finally appeared and sat us at a booth. The booths are really squishy and the table is pretty high. It was really awkward and kind of uncomfortable. Then after a couple minutes, our server finally appeared and gave a very unenthusiastic intro. She asked if we had ever been here before and my boyfriend said no because he hadn't been, and she said ""oh you haven't? Uh, I'll be right back."" She then proceeded to the table behind us because they had just gotten their food, and started talking to them and got them refills. Finally, she came back and gave her little speech about the touch screen. She brought us our drinks and again, we waiting quite some time while she talked to other tables before she finally came back to us to see if we wanted to order. At most, this girl had three or four tables, including us. It wasn't busy at all. After that, things were okay. She checked on us periodically then we paid on the screen and left. Not terrible, but also not the best when it comes to service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-altoona?start=20
Amanda K.,"Altoona, PA",5,9,9,4.0,1/2/2016,"My husband and I went before the official opening. Our food was hot and timely, considering the large amount of people there.
