If you let your kids play on that device on the table you will be charged an 'entertainment fee'. 2.

Buck E.,"Cary, NC",0,8,,1.0,8/5/2017,"Coming back to this location was a horrible mistake. Got our order wrong twice and when the manager came the second time, we told him it was still wrong and he says ""sorry"" and walks away. They took it off the bill (which they should have) but still were extremely rude and not at all accommodating. Our server did not come back ONCE even though neither of us got drink refills. Oh actually, at the end he came to bring the check and blames his lack of attention or service on the fact that he just got a 32 person table. Completely understandable..... except for the fact that the table had 17 people at it and was already being taken care of by 2 different servers..... it was a little busy in there but not really. I understand a couple of mistakes here and there, but this place is horrible. Going to continue to steer people away from this restaurant! One of the worst places in apex please don't go here unless you are looking to spend an unnecessarily long time, receive awful service, or the wrong order. Wasn't expecting anything different from this location but definitely never making the mistake of coming here again! Very bad!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-apex?start=20
David H.,"Patterson, CA",34,12,1,2.0,1/30/2016,"The only reason I am giving them 2 stars is because the food is good.  The service here absolutely sucked! They brought out one burger that was wrong. Another one that was raw. It took over twenty minutes to bring out another properly cooked burger. Also asked for crispy fries at the start. The only Timmons I received them was five minutes after the last burger arrived, and well after all of the food on the table was eaten. I heard ""I'm sorry"" about a dozen times. When the manager showed up and I told her that my order was wrong, she responded with a sarcastic answer. By the way her name is Kristen, as she repeatedly told me every time she came out to give us the heating progress of the raw burger. When I called her out on the sarcasm, our dinner was free. Don't waste your money here, spend five bucks more a person and go to Longhorn Steakhouse next door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-apex?start=20

Jon Z.,"Fuquay-Varina, NC",13,100,69,3.0,10/3/2015,"Usual service good but not great. Everyone seems a little overwhelmed on the floor.  Burger was okay, not as juicy as I like, but than its hard to get a juicy well done burger. I will not order a medium well burger at a chain store, that doesn't use daily fresh ground beef.

Chris D.,"Apex, NC",40,22,1,1.0,3/2/2015,"It was really my fault. I knew I was at Red Robin- where even their ""signature burgers"" aren't good. Honestly, if you're not even good at making what you're known for, what are we even doing? But acquiescing to the wishes of the rest of my extended family, I found myself at Red Robin on a Sunday night. This was only the first of many poor decisions.  The second was ordering an appetizer. This actually only proved to be disastrous because our waitress forgot to ever put the order in. Explaining to hungry kids that the food they were expecting is no longer coming is a less than thrilling adventure. The waitress was apologetic, but otherwise the action was forgotten. We were admittedly a large table, but we were also one of only 4 tables seated in the entire restaurant. The manager clearly believed (incorrectly) that our lone server could handle it by herself. This might have something to do with the entire staff of the restaurant being under 25 years of age and seemingly (erroneously) believing that they were living out the plot of the movie ""Waiting"". I get it. Service industry jobs are hard and you've got to break up the monotony somehow, but keep the games and flirting in the back- at least while I'm still waiting on my (bad) food.  Our food arrived. Well- most of it. It took an extra 10min to get my 9-year-old his grilled cheese and fries. Clearly that's a complicated order. My crab cake ""burger"" was heinously bad. The ciabatta roll was dry. The arugula was wilted. The ""garlic aioli"" was thin mayonnaise with no detectable garlic or acidity. The crab cake itself was a frozen, straight-from-the-bag holocaust of mushy ""crab"" and bell peppers that tasted like Frisky cat food. My cousin's cheeseburger arrived with an extra hair as a garnish.  Again- this was my mistake. All of this could've been avoided had I merely insisted that my family avoid a chain restaurant that I knew to be particularly bad even among chain restaurants and walk across the parking lot to Tyler's where the food is fresh and no more expensive. Unfortunately I played the peacemaker and ultimately paid the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-apex?start=20
William D.,"Cary, NC",1,5,,2.0,9/18/2016,"How far the great Red Robin has fallen - perhaps it's all the high-end burger competition now but this chain has done everything to cut costs to the bone and as usual, we are now seeing pretty consistent drops in quality and service. Kiosks on the table to increase efficiency and reduce wait staff now gives license for wait staff to ignore you. Remember those bottomless steak fry baskets? Not anymore - sure, the menu says bottomless but they start you with a little metal sleeve of fries now and then drag out bringing you any refills until you just want to go back in the kitchen and make them yourself. The burgers are still pretty good but the prices just keep climbing. The whole experience has declined from the decor and cleanliness to the up-selling of apps, drinks and desserts to the downscaling of the food and service. Goodbye Red Robin - we're off to 5 Guys or BurgerFi - at least there we know exactly what we are getting and it is consistent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-apex?start=20
David B.,"Cary, NC",0,20,1,2.0,2/18/2015,"I have to say recent reviews are fairly accurate.  Service is pretty bad.  Every step of the meal moves at a glacial rate.  The waitress was often not around for extended periods.  I had to flag her down once across the room by waving my white napkin.   An ice tea refill took a very long time even after she had noted mine was empty and asked if I needed refill.  She did not take old glass when she brought a new one.  The new glass had a giant chip on the bottom corner - should have been thrown away.  There was clutter all over the table.  They leave various menus on the table hoping you'll order more drinks or dessert.  Main courses took a long time to arrive - hamburgers! She kind of jammed the check on us while we were still eating but then took forever to pick it up and a long time to return.  The whole meal went like that.   I can say in her favor she was decently friendly but no idea how to do a good job as a waitress.   Multiple tables around us were not cleaned off long after the patrons had left.  There were a lot of empty tables too so it wasn't an over-crowded time.   Here's the topper - when we left there was at least 5 or 6 groups of people waiting for tables.   The food was okay.  The burger was good, the sweet tea was good. Fries were bitter (old oil), daughter's milk shake was not bad, nothing out of the ordinary.  My wife said the Alaskan Crabcake sandwich (close to $15 IIRC) was terrible.  Nothing special here, Five Guys burgers are slightly better and less expensive.   Overall surprising how bad the service is.  There's all these reviews that say that but no improvement.  Guess they don't read Yelp.  One glitch is okay but here it was one thing after another.  I eat at the one in Charlotte occasionally and it has none of these problems.  We won't return to this establishment, that's pretty clear.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-apex?start=20
David S.,"Holly Springs, NC",7,69,39,3.0,12/28/2014,"The burgers were above average, but not as good as other places we have been to this year. The wait to get in was about 20 minutes on a Friday night. While we were waiting my wife had a large blue moon which is about $7. We paid the extra $0.99 per entree to get the special garlic herb crusted fries with the shaved parmesan cheese... But they never arrived . So we asked for seconds on the bottomless fries but they didn't come until after we paid the bill because it took so long they forgot about them. To our server's credit she boxed them up for us, but the magic eludes them  on the warm up at home. I will say this, I am a heavy Diet Coke drinker and I was never without.

Catherine S.,"Apex, NC",47,62,21,3.0,5/29/2015,"Let's start with the sanitation grade...90. Not impressive, hence the 3 stars. But, there was no wait so we were seated immediately. The waitress was kind and pretty responsive on bringing drink refills, etc.  I probably wouldn't go back but their Fiesta Chicken Salad was soooo yummy as usual.

Terry H.,"Euless, TX",43,437,221,3.0,3/15/2015,"11am Sunday morning. Service was ok. Only 2-3 other tables and the server was friendly but not real attentive. It does seem they are way under staffed or they just don't care. Not sure which.  I had the BBQ chicken salad. It was very good. Lettuce was fresh, chicken was hot.  Wife had the soup and salad. The tortilla soup was fabulous.  We have been here many times but not recently, and I think they need an attitude adjustment back to customer Service.

Vin D.,"Cary, NC",2,22,2,2.0,4/16/2015,"We've eaten here four or five times over the past year, mainly because our seven-year-old likes Red Robin for the games in the lobby and grilled cheese sandwiches on the menu. He'd probably give the place five stars when they throw in a milkshake. I was on the fence between two and three stars (probably overthinking here) because although the service is always slower than it ought to be, the staff generally seem like decent people who individually are not out to ruin anyone's night. I'm going with two stars after tonight's visit because of the sticky tabletop and greasy silverware--thankfully I ordered a burger and didn't actually need to touch the greasy fork, but it still gave me the creeps sitting there next to my plate. Speaking of food, it's not that great once you're out of your grilled cheese sandwich phase. The burgers are giant, and a bit expensive in my opinion for assembly line chow, though they do come with every topping known to man. My fries were soggy tonight--think drive-through vintage ten miles down the road. There are better burgers within driving distance--Five Guys comes to mind (I'm sure there are others, but we're still learning the area). My other problem is the service is painfully slow and sporadic. If they're busy, expect to spend close to an hour waiting for your food to arrive. Even when they aren't busy, food takes 20 minutes to reach your table. Maybe that's why they have all those knickknacks on the walls so you have something to look at while you wait. And wait. The biggest disappointment to me is Red Robin doesn't have to be terrible. We used to frequent one in another city that was blazing fast and served hot, crisp fries every time. I wish that one was closer. But then I would probably eat Red Robin too often, and that wouldn't be good, either. Sigh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-apex?start=20
Brad C.,"Apex, NC",24,60,2,3.0,3/28/2015,"Burgers and other food were very good. The condiments and promos at the table were disgusting -- obviously not cleaned in a long time, if ever. The beer list provided was four months old, much of it no longer available. Server wasn't on top of things, but did make things right throughout the visit. I'd prefer to not have to ask for silverware after our food has arrived. She was very friendly.

Amy W.,"Apex, NC",9,19,3,5.0,9/9/2015,"Some of these negative reviews patrons left for Red Robin are ""for the birds""! Okay, Red Robin isn't some hoity-toity, fine dining restaurant, and shouldn't be compared to or reviewed as such. Red Robin is the go-to restaurant for families with children. They have TV's, arcade games, balloons, crayons and activity placemats, they sing loudly to customers with birthdays, they serve milkshakes, burgers and ""bottomless"" fries, etc. This all isn't for the snooty, formal-dining adult, it's to keep young diners entertained throughout the meal. Red Robin is known for their good food, large portions and fair prices, and this is what we always receive here. The restaurant is always clean, the service is always prompt, and the food is always served hot.

Stephanie H.,"Fuquay Varina, NC",60,272,322,1.0,3/31/2014,"I'd give this a zero star rating if I could.  Our server, Matt was ""flustered"" as the manager put it. I should've known walking in when the host seated us and ran that this meal would be problematic. Apparently walking customers to a table, dropping the menus and joining the Happy Birthday sing-a-long is more important than making guests feel welcome.  Our server, Matt took our orders down and a few minutes later brought said orders to the table. We noticed a side of broccoli was missing and we asked for ranch. He never brought those items. We had to wait until the manager strolled around to get our missing items. Matt did stop by to drop our check halfway through our meal ""for our convenience"".....our? We told him we needed it split and I also had to ask for a refill of water at that point. He brought the water but never returned with the checks. Finally, after sitting there for what seemed like an eternity, manager walks past again. We told him we needed the checks and he apologized and said Matt the waiter was flustered, which I don't buy because we saw him standing around chatting quite a bit. Not to mention the place was almost dead - 4 maybe 5 tables of 2-4 people and plenty of servers. We saw at least one other table doing the neck strain/attempt to make eye contact look that was all too familiar from our experience.  We never saw good old Matt other than to take our orders and bring us our check way too early. For the first time in forever, I didn't tip -that's right.  If I could've left without paying a dime for that crap experience, I would've.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-apex?start=20

Samantha P.,"Holly Springs, NC",10,59,12,4.0,4/1/2015,"Out running errands and we had our puppy with us; we came here since they have outdoor seating. It was strange because no one acknowledged the dog, but they gave us some weird looks. Maybe they don't actually allow dogs, but there was no one else outside so they left it alone...? Not sure, it definitely felt strange.  It was a chilly day but there was some sun that helped warm us up. I imagine on a really hot day there would be too sun for it to be pleasant outside.  Menu was re-done from the last time we went (about year+) so a little overwhelming. Anyway food was fine, got a burger and a crispy chicken sandwich with fries. Asked for hot sauce with the chicken sandwich and they remembered it so we did not have to ask twice, which is a plus service-wise!  Got the fruffles for dessert which were pretty good! The picture shows sauce and whipped cream for dipping and they put the whipped cream on plate more for decoration than dipping. They are very rich so took them to go. I noticed after keeping them in the fridge that they were much softer than at the restaurant - my guess is they keep them frozen - they get much better once they have some time to thaw out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-apex?start=20

I like the burger selections and I like the bottomless fries. I have never had much problems with the staff. They were always very friendly. Now to the not so good. After ordering it took a really long time to get the food. It was around 20 minutes? This was for one double burger and one specialty burger. Speaking for the double burger, the meat was dry when eating. Nice glove it's though. The bun started getting soggy fast. I probably took about 3-4 minutes eating it before the sogginess.

My mom had the veggie burger and loved it. My dad had fish and chips and said it was too salty to eat. I had a regular cheeseburger. It was ok, we make better burgers at home. My biggest complaint about Red Robin is the service. It's slow always even when there are few people in the restaurant. I don't understand. They advertise bottomless fries and it's nearly impossible to get them. I guess that's the point! They also advertise bottomless side salad which is also difficult to get.

Ranging from 10-13$ for a burger, albeit generally a large portion size but still very pricey. They do have smaller, less expensive options.  The one star rating is due primarily to their lack of delivering to their tag line. When you say that you have bottomless fries, it tends to make you believe that you will receive, well, bottomless fries (within reason of course).  After requesting ONE additional refill on the fries, it was never delivered. Asked the staff there twice and the extra order never arrived.  Waited at least 15-20 minutes and the order never arrived.

Steve P.,"Bowie, MD",42,2,,1.0,7/16/2017,"Came in for lunch with my family on Saturday 7/15. Waited at the front door area way too long for someone to walk up and decide to seat us. It was not at all busy and there is no reason for that at all! First negative review was that when you walk in, they advertise a deal for buying a $25 gift card with a free movie ticket. We start by asking our server if we can buy the gift card and then use it during our lunch. Apparently Red Robin will not allow this because you can only use a gift card 6 hours after purchase which is absolutely ridiculous. They would still be getting our money so why deny this? Well, I will tell you why...its so they can get more money out of you. The server should have sent his manager over to speak with us but he did not. We probably would have bought the gift card either way but you had no sales tactic or motivation to work with your customer so we will spend that money elsewhere. We will learn later in our visit why and what type of server he is which is lazy and not motivated for sales whatsoever.  Second and most important part of this review...our server. He starts our visit by telling us it has been a slow day so far. Keep in mind it is just lunch time so to say you are having a slow day is a bit concerning because it is ONLY lunch time!!! He then tells us that he will be going home early based on this. This should have been a red flag for us because once somebody decides to tell you their life story and their issues, it generally means that it will not be a good visit but we went with it because we thought that since he had a slow day, he would be at the top of his game for serving us. WRONG!  Regardless of how slow it was, this lazy fool was not focussed on taking care of us or the interests of Red Robin. He was focussed on going home and we were standing in his way.  We had to ask for refills, he didnt even bring us our food...someone else did, he screwed up our endless fries order and most importantly he kept trying to rush us out the door by coming by and asking if we knew how to use the payment tablet on the table and clearing our table and standing over us while we were trying to finish our meals and have lunch conversation as a family. Listen buddy, I know you are trying to leave but we dont need you standing over us and rushing us out because all you are doing is screwing yourself and your potential tip. If you want to leave so bad, just come by once and tell us you are transferring our tab to a more capable server that will actually be there and is not being sent home. Your schedule has NOTHING to do with me and my family and the money we are spending at Red Robin!!!!

Again...this is lunch time!!!! And we are your last table!?!?! Clearly there is a reason you are being sent home.

Sue C.,"Apex, NC",0,10,3,2.0,10/24/2017,Service is incredibly slow on an un-busy night. Can't tell if the problem was the server or kitchen or both. Food was served luke warm rather than hot.

F S.,"Cary, NC",0,4,,4.0,3/12/2017,"I've always through Red Robin to be closer to the 'mediocre' side of the scale but the last exerpience was very refreshing.  Went with four friends to lunch.  We're seated/served promptly and cheerfully and the food was above expectations.  Waiter was prompt and diligent returning with drinks/sauces and of course the bottomless fries.  He had a family emergency to attend to, so we were notified and had another server immediately with us.  Even at the end splitting the bill four equal ways was no issue and the waitress aided us jovially.  All in all great way to start an afternoon and surprisingly good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-apex
Robert L.,"Cary, NC",0,9,,2.0,10/17/2017,"The food and service are fine, but we had an issue with the tablets at the table that really marred our experience.  First we noticed a $1.99 entertainment fee.  Apparently this fee is charged if children play the tablet.  There is no requirement for adult consent.  Either the games should be free or they should require a credit card to play the games.  The manager removed the fee, but it took time and we had to ask.  It comes off as a very underhanded business tactic.  Then we tried to pay, we used a rewards card for a free birthday. Originally it took off the hamburger, then we added a tip.  When we swiped the card it asked us to add the tip again and added back the previously free hamburger.  We removed the hamburger and added the tip and swiped the card, then selected to option for the tablet to print a receipt which it did not do. We went to the bar and requested a receipt and the hamburger was added back and the tip was gone.  We eventually go it straightened out, but not without significant difficulty.  No one is going to Red Robin because they have the best food.  People are going for an easy, pleasant experience.  The tablet poses significant issues that significantly detract from the experience.  There are many other casual dining restaurants to choose from without experiencing that difficulty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-apex

Erin B.,"Cary, NC",1,70,5,2.0,6/6/2015,"We decided on Red Robin because there wasn't a wait on a Friday.  After we were seated it was clear why. The 90 sanitation rating was concerning too. The waitress came right away but afterward was extremely slow. We literally had to wave her down for straws, drink refills, and to get the bill. We've eaten at multiple Red Robin restaurants over the years but the quality continues to diminish. Plus the ""endless fries"" are a joke. They give you a few to start then take so long to bring more that you're ready to leave by the time thy come out. We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-apex?start=40

One of our children's orders was wrong and after asking. For the cheese to go on the cheeseburger, she walked by 4 times before I finally asked again and then 3 min later we finally got it. She then made herself so scare that we never had a chance to get a refill on fries for the burger being shared between 2 adults.

Chris D.,"Apex, NC",16,39,16,3.0,3/20/2014,"I went here with my Burger group back in November 2012.  I took a poll of the group and based on very subjective criteria I scored them in several different categories on a scale of 1 to 10.

Only if you ask for more.  Good luck finding your waitress.  -Received my check WHILE waiting on second helping of fries.  Wasn't asked if we needed anything, more drink, dessert, to-go box, etc.  -It took WAY too long to get that second helping of fries. The bad part? They brought out a measly 6 fries on a plate.  The worst part?  I was asked if I wanted them to go when they finally arrived!  Only second time eating at a Red Robin.

Tisha R.,"Severn, MD",0,7,3,2.0,1/25/2016,"I have been to a few Red Robin's and I've never expired what I did at this particular one....I went to the Apex location for the 1st & probably last time. The night I went it was practically empty but service was still on the slow side. I ordered a cup of ""french onion""...it looked weird when I  received it....really gooey on top....I then realized why...there was no ""crouton/bread"" in the top of the soup as how normal ""french onion"" soup is made....no biggie just an oversight...I brought it to the attention of my waitress...""we'll fix it"" she said....now she leaves for a long period of time and returns with 2 pieces of bread with yellow cheese on top & a cup of ""beer cheese""....needless to say I was confused....the beer cheese confused me because although I did ask for a side of cheese sauce for my fries with my burger I did not expect it to come out without my meal therefore sitting at the table getting cold (really didn't matter it was gross anyways)....but the 2 pieces of bread with cheese on top were definitely a mystery. Come to find out this was the bread I was to add to my now cold soup! I'm sorry but any establishment I have ever been to would make a whole new soup....this isn't a build you own soup restaurant....the cheese wasn't even the same as the kind that comes on the soup! I must say I was definitely turned off by this. Next came the burger....now I tried to be different and order the ""lettuce bun""....of course I thought the ""bun"" was a big  piece or pieces of romaine lettuce as pictured....nope I received 1/2 of a head of iceberg lettuce literally cut in half with my burger contents in between....my burger was completely unmanageable & unedible. I literally had to dissect it....take out all the hard unedible pieces and try to assemble my own wrap. I was definitely not a happy birthday girl as this is why I was out that night. I'm not sure how long this particular Red Robin has been in this location but I am not a fan, which really sucks because I just moved to the area and I truly do love Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-apex?start=40
Sue P.,"Miami, FL",106,117,122,3.0,5/31/2010,"If you have kids this place will provide many distractions for them. Enough to give you a couple of moments to breathe without feeling like you're neglecting them.  My 7 month old  was mesmerized by the vibrant colors used in the interior and the cartoons playing on the tv's. They recently added a Mac and Cheese dinner and it's probably the best I've ever had.   It's loaded 4 cheeses and nice and crunchy on top.     The food they serve here are mostly burgers/wraps.  I'm not a burger/sandwich person.  Red Robin is not my first choice when it comes to dining.  However, I understand why it's popular.  It's a national chain and caters to families.  Those who don't have kids may find them extremely annoying in restaurant settings (heck, so do I but then again I don't have a toddler yet).    So if you don't like the sound of children screaming during dinner, avoid Red Robin at all costs.   I will also have to make a note that they do have adult friendly drinks available and they are strong!   So maybe if you pound a couple of these back - the screaming children will seem less annoying?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-apex?start=40

Melissa B.,"Cameron, NC",14,11,,4.0,8/13/2008,"Red Robin is definitely a restaurant that caters to families with children--you're greeted by a television in the floor tuned to the Cartoon Network for goodness sakes. If you aren't a parent, or if you are a parent out on a rare night without the kids, you'll probably enjoy the atmosphere somewhere else much better. However, if you have kids in tow, this is the place for you. The kids' menu is varied, and they offer healthy side dish options such as cantaloupe and carrot sticks. The waitstaff and management seem to know that families with kids are their bread and butter, and they are gracious and attentive. During a recent visit, the manager stopped by our table and chatted with our 6-year-old son who had the macaroni. She told him that if he finished that dish he should have them bring him more. Well, when he asked for more he got it; initially the waitress charged us for the replenishment as a second order. However, when we told her what the manager had said to our son, she never questioned us and she immediately removed the charge from our bill. They also offer bottomless steak fries--a dangerous proposition indeed. We have them brought out as an appetizer and enjoy them with the meal as well. The Crispy Chicken Burger is exceptional, and my husband especially enjoys the A1 Peppercorn Burger. If you are watching your waistline, try the Ensenada Chicken Platter with the dressing on the side--it's a dieting mom's dream.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-apex?start=60
