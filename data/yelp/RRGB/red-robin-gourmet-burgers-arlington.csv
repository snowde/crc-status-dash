Darrell S.,"Arlington, TX",0,35,18,4.0,9/23/2017,"This place is on my families normal rotation for lunch / dinner because it's conveniently located and generally has something that will appeal to all members of the family and with 2 little ones that's not the case with everywhere.  It's also handy to bribe your kids into acting appropriately in order to get a free balloon before we leave.  I know you're jealous that I can still bribe my kids with a balloon.  This age will soon pass so I'm enjoying every second of it. It was hot Saturday so the requirements for lunch with the grandparents was that the place have cold drinks and an AC.  Red Robin fit the bill.  I got the turkey burger, the wife got the Royal Red Robin which has an egg and is one of our favorites and Nana got the ""Wedgie"" which has no bun and Papa got the veggie burger so we covered almost all the things they have burger wise.  Everyone was very satisfied and due to unlimited fries, VERY full.  Our server while being pretty busy was on point and even found the time to interact and have a playful joking manner, she was great. This place also has some pretty good desserts so if you have the will power to turn down the 3rd (or 4th) basket of fries keep that in mind ( I wasn't able to this time).  Overall a very filling experience with good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington
Loose S.,"Arlington, TX",86,2,,1.0,12/29/2017,"Just tried to place a to-go order at 9:16 PM on Friday night at this establishment and was promptly told by the person on the phone that they do not take to go orders an hour before close. The person in the background was audibly huffing and puffing, saying to someone else ""are you kidding me?"". Would they prefer I come sit in some poor servers section until after close? I am in the industry and if someone told that to a guest in my building they would need to find a new job. We're simply trying to be polite by making our order take out. Instead we will take our business to one of the other dozen restaurants right next door. We ""are not kidding you"" when we say we will never try to order from your restaurant again. PS both of your neon signs are going out. Maybe if y'all sold some food you could fix it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington
Beverly C.,"Arlington, TX",14,72,91,4.0,5/29/2017,"Took my mom here for a burger after a morning of shopping, and boy, was she happy!  She ordered a Burnin' Love, and I got the Whiskey River BBQ. Both of the burgers were delicious, and so big that we could only eat half of our burgers. The fries were delicious as always, and we love that we can order more fries! Red Robin, that is an AWESOME practice! We treated ourselves this time with our drink of choice. Deciding to put calorie counting to the side for the lunch, we both ordered cream sodas! She raspberry and me orange. How delicious! We even got seconds on these. Heaven has to have cream sodas! :) We will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington
Trang L.,"Grand Prairie, TX",0,9,3,1.0,1/1/2018,"So my brother is in town and he wanted a  good burger so we all decided to go to Red Robin. This was an awful service experience. I am in the industry and I understand being busy and getting in the weeds but the way our waitress left our table is unacceptable. The picture I attached is what the table looked like when she dropped our desserts. We had no where to move to eat. It was all building up since appetizers. We accidentally spilled a drink on the table trying to rearrange stuff so we could have room the have dessert.  We moved plates to the side so she could reach to clear it for us but each time she came to check on us she dropped something off but didn't take anything with her. The result was a disaster of a table, with no room for dessert. Side note, I cleaned up the spill myself and asked for a new set of silver be for a fellow server and he rolled his eyes at me and said it's not his table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington

Chuck M.,"Fort Worth, TX",1282,673,344,3.0,5/27/2017,"Red Robin is our ""go to"" burger place. My wife and I frequent several different locations and have had good experiences at all of them with the food and the service. We love their fried zucchini, fried cheese and jalapeno coins. Many times when I'm in the mood for a burger, my wife will get one of her favorite appetizers. During a recent visit that was the case. I wanted a burger and she wanted fried cheese and jalapeno coins (fried jalapeno slices). Since I've had problems finishing their 1/2 pound burgers in the past I decided to try one of their Taven Doubles. They're a double patty burger and a bit cheaper than their signature burgers. I decided on the ""Smokey Jack Taven Double."" It sounded delicious and just what the doctor ordered. Our server was very efficient in getting our drinks to us and taking our order. When I ordered the ""Smokey Jack"" he even remarked that he had tasted it and it was yummy! I couldn't wait. Instead of their famous steak fries, I opted for the sweet potato fries with the spicy ketchup. YUMMY. I'm a ""seasoned"" restaurant manager. Even though I haven't been in the business for close to 20 years I look at my dining experience from a totally different viewpoint, through the eyes of a manager. Fairly quickly our order was delivered. My wife's appetizer was perfect and my Tavern Burger was just the right size. It was manageable and I wouldn't feel stuffed after eating it. My burger was hot, juicy and delicious. Halfway through the burger, I discovered it wasn't a ""Smokey Jack"", but just the regular Red Robin Tavern burger. I should have noticed it on the first bite but it just didn't dawn on me. Halfway through eating a burger, I wasn't about to complain and get another burger prepared. Yes, I should have brought it up to the manager in charge, but we were short on time and due at an appointment. I also wasn't out for a free meal. I am sure that there was just a mixup in the kitchen. There was one other strange thing that happened, the menu price stated $6.99 for the Tavern Burgers, but I believe on our ticket my burger was priced out at $7.99. And yes on the ticket, it stated ""Smokey Jack."" It wasn't that big a deal and I didn't realize the error until I got home and looked at an online menu. I didn't customize my burger at all with any additions so it should have been $6.99. This experience will not deter us from visiting our favorite burger places, Reb Robin. We will be back again soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington
Jesse S.,"Grand Prairie, TX",15,89,25,1.0,9/17/2017,So came to this dispicable place after a very long hiatus.  It was so long I had forgotten why I stopped coming.  In my mind I loved the fries but the burger was a complete fail. See attached picture. In fact I think it was worse than before the reason I stopped going.  I had to come home and put condiments on my very dry lifeless burger.  The fries were still good and they give you plenty even to go. The restaurant had just opened and I ordered in the bar. It was obviously not clean due to the smell and the flies everywhere.  This was the reason I opted for Togo rather than eating there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington

Brad D.,"Waxahachie, TX",58,47,2,5.0,9/7/2017,"Really got to give this place some serious kudos! Was there last week and accidentally ordered a burger that came with mushrooms. Didn't even realize it until they brought it out, but I am very allergic, so I asked if they could remake. Totally my fault for not paying attention to what I was ordering, but the waitress was so apologetic and took it back right away. The manager even came over to apologize (even though I told him it was my fault completely) and brought some fries for me to eat while he remade my burger. Great customer service is always expected by consumers but not recognized nearly enough!

James P.,"Arlington, TX",260,190,130,1.0,4/12/2016,"My friend says that he really loves the burgers here, and that's fine. Maybe I should give it a second shot and order a specialty burger in the interest of fairness; however, that chance will be hard to come by after everything I ordered came out mediocre to put it nicely. I ordered the onion rings, a normal burger and this sesame chicken looking appetizer.  The standard that Red Robin has to beat in my head is something like Chili's or Five Guys and that did not happen. They're all priced similarly depending how you order and after that it's just simple economics. For the same price, can a similar or better experience be had? And the answer is no.  But the server was super nice. Unfortunately, super niceness cannot trump disappointing, unfulfilling food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington

However, the last couple of times we have been there, the service has been lacking. We waited forever to get drink refills. When we asked for the check, the waitress told us she'd be right back. But about 10 min later we see her standing at the hostess booth chatting. We had to go up there ask her for it again.

Wendy C.,"Arlington, TX",36,15,20,3.0,10/20/2016,"Had dinner here tonight with my best friend. We were seated right away and our server was prompt with taking our order. My friend got the fried pickles for an appetizer, I forget what they call them in the menu. She said they were good. I got a cheeseburger and she got the Chili cheeseburger. They were bought cooked well and were good. Nothing amazing but a good burger. They both came with bottomless steak fries. (I don't know anyone except for my 12 year old that would really take advantage of bottomless fries.) They were ok, but mine were kinda dry and I don't think they had any salt or seasoning on them whatsoever. Our server cleared out plates as soon as the last bites were taken, and I decided I wanted desert. Only problem with that was he disappeared. Seemed to me like he had tables on both sides of the restaurant....I finally flagged him down and ordered the Mile High Mud Pie. They aren't kidding by calling it that! (See pic). As a ""junk "" food lover I can tell you it was great!  Also, the restaurant has an ""open"" kitchen so all the servers tend to hang out where the food comes out for the orders, and it's right in the middle of the place. Which is cool, but I got tired of listening to them joke around (loudly) and sometimes discuss stuff that may not have been appropriate for some of their clientele (not me....but I know how folks are these day). Just something they should keep in mind. Overall, the food and the service were alright.

Edited: 12/13/15 - so my husband and I returned today to redeem our 2 free burgers/entrees card. I decided to not order a burger. I got the ragin Cajun chicken sandwich. It was really good.

My issue here was that our service was terrible. We came for a late lunch/early dinner around 3:30 - we ordered shortly afterward but did not get our meal until 4:25! We ordered our beers at 3:55 and did not get them until 4:15!! They were not even busy, there was one or two other tables in our section total.

We all ordered something different, and everyone seemed to really like what they chose. I got the Hickory BBQ Burger I think it was called. It was delicious, only thing I would've changed was added a little more BBQ it was kind of thin and you couldn't taste it too much. And bottomless fries, yep we all took advantage of more fries, and with their seasoning, yep, yep.  Only deal with here is the burgers are really pricy, I mean $10 for a burger, it's a little much.

And the milkshakes? To die for. This is a pregnant woman (me)'s dream come true. Burgers are typically priced around the $10 range (more if you add more, obviously) and are pretty big. I end up cutting mine in half and saving the rest for another meal, lol. The milkshakes are huge too; try the chocolate-banana, mmmmmmm. The only thing I'd improve at this location would be service. Visited with a friend on a weekday lunch here and the place really wasn't buzzing with business. There were more empty tables than filled and yet it took quite some time just to get us sat down.

My MIL opted for the Souper Sandwich combo, with a cup of French onion soup and a Caesar chicken wrap.  The soup had barely any broth and was chock full of onions and cheese.  Ok, but not great.  The Caesar chicken wrap was huge....seemed to have perfect flavor and she ate it all!

Shauna T.,"Arlington, TX",257,267,289,4.0,9/8/2014,"How have I not written a review for Red Robin... I should be ashamed of myself. The burgers here are excellent and I love how the fries just keep coming. I really like how casual this place is. If you're looking for a nice place to get your hands dirty while eating a satisfying burger, you have found it. Red Robin has a burger for everyone and every burger comes with endless steak fries.  Burgers: My go to burger is the California Chicken because I love avocado and bacon on anything. However, the last time I visited, I had the Royal Red Robin. I always thought the California Chicken was the way to go for so many years, but I've actually been depriving myself of an awesome burger that just blew me away. I see why the Royal Red Robin is a signature burger because it literally has everything in it, and it's topped with an over easy egg. Yum.  Fries: To accompany a good burger, Red Robin gives an endless amount of steak fries. Perfect consistency to accompany the several different sauces that are available. My personal favorite is the signature Campfire sauce, which tastes like a mild version of Chick Fil A sauce. There's almost (if not already) 10 different sauces to choose from. I also get a kick out of the bacon sauce because bacon on anything just makes it so much better. Bacon in my burger, bacon flavored sauce for my fries.. Can't get enough. Drinks: They have your beers and margaritas, but I have to emphasize the milkshakes here. They are awesome! I had the mint brownie milkshake last time and I loved the chunks of fudgey brownie in an ice cold, creamy mix.  Impossible to leave hungry here. Huge selection of burgers, but if you don't like any of them, there's an option to build your own. Consistent staff and food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington?start=20
Ashley W.,"Fort Wainwright, AK",0,4,5,1.0,2/16/2016,"TERRIBLE service during the day.  Sat in the bar and the server took about 5 minutes to get to us (no big, but should have been a sign) took our drink orders, slammed our drinks down and disappeared for another 10-15 minutes. Had to ask the hostess to send her back because we were ready to order and were on our lunch break of one hour only. She came back irritated, took our order with sass, and left again.(other guests had to go to the bar to order their food from her or ask on the status of their meals also)  After another 10 minutes of no food we asked about it and she said ""it's coming. I'll send a manager"". Well Jared came over and told us ""it's on it's way we have been in the back working on a huge to go order and that's why we have been taking so long"" being irritated we dared to ask where our food was after sitting in the restaurant for 35 minutes at this point. We told him it would have been better to have told us that service would have taken longer today because of the large order and let us decide what we wanted to do. He said ""well we have a big order what do you expect me to do"" and started getting loud with us. I told him I've worked in food service before and you manage all parts of your restaurant and if you need help or can't do that then get another manager. He started yelling at us and we told him he was being unprofessional and he said we insulted him by saying he needed another manager. We told him he was insulting us and that you don't treat customers that way. I asked for the corporate number and he said ""IM the general manager"" and I said yes but I want corporate and he said ""it's at the hostess stand"" we told him we no longer wanted our food and we would be leaving, as they had wasted our whole lunch hour ad we had to go.  He decided to make a scene yelling across the bar saying ""oh no don't you worry it's on me and I'll box it up for you"" as we were walking away.  We stopped at the hostess stand to get the card and they were out and had to go get more. Jud came up and was trying to do damage control because Jared was OUT OF CONTROL at this point. I've never seen someone who is supposed to manage a store act that way because he got offended he can't handle two things at once. Jared proceeded to walk up in between us talking with Jud, who asked what happened and was trying to fix it, and Jared tried to put the to go bags ON US and make us take it, and finally set them on some menus between us and Jud. Jud had to turn to Jared and tell him to walk away. WHO ACTS LIKE THAT? What kind of ""manager"" acts like that????  The proprietor needs to SERIOUSLY reconsider Jared's role at this restaurant and either do some elaborate retraining with him or just let him go. As far as I'm concerned, this restaurant will fail with Jared because he's too concerned about his ego rather than being in the customer service industry.  ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE.   And after alllllll of that we still have not heard from the manager or person in charge of that restaurant.  Wow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington?start=20
Victoria T.,"Arlington, TX",270,53,46,4.0,6/12/2014,"Known for their burgers, I wasn't disappointed in mine at all. I ordered the Smoked and Pepper, I think it was called. It was a ciabatta bun with bacon and a delicious BBQ sauce. I split it with my cousin because I'm notorious for never finishing a whole burger. I substituted the regular fries for sweet potato fries and they were fantastic! I am a sucker for sweet potato fries! Thin and crispy, just the way I like them. We also had a small side of Mac and cheese and it was ok. It was American cheese and it just tasted and looked like something from a box to be honest. For appetizers, we ordered the onion ring tower and fried zucchini. Both were delicious. But c'mon - anything deep fried is delicious! I like how they both come with sauces and they're always willing to bring you extra.  For drinks, I ordered the Cookie Dream milkshake and also mooched off of my cousin's mint brownie shake as well.

Charles H.,"Dallas, TX",295,35,6,4.0,10/1/2014,"This review is not so much about Red Robin.  The stars are for the service.  If it were for the food, it would be 2.5 or 3, which I don't consider bad for a chain and hence, the 4 stars.  I asked for my burger to be cooked medium and it came out not that way, but still good.  I didn't want to be ""that"" person on ""that"" night because it really made no difference in my experience. These stars are for Sam.  Sam is the bartender who took very good care of me when I went to use my birthday coupon.  Normally, servers and bartenders have a justifiable disdain for the freebie guest.  Especially, the freebie guest sitting at the bar not drinking anything but cranberry juice and club soda. The freebie guest usually never tips on what the bill would have been, if at all.  She did not ignore me or treat me like she expected me not to take care of her. Sam was friendly, attentive even to the point of suggesting for and making me a dipping sauce that she personally likes.  The conversation was light, not too much or too little.  This is not any earth shattering review, but in these concepts you never know what you will get in terms of service.  It was just refreshing to get good service.   Go see Sam.  She will take good care of you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington?start=20

My personal favorite is always with onion straws and BBQ sauce and whatever else catches my eye, but there are so many combos it can be hard to pick.

They hardly ever mess up an order (I come here a lot), but the one or two times they have, they are always very gracious about correcting it. Another point I would like to make about Red Robin in general is, if you or someone you know is a vegetarian, this place is the bomb. You can order any burger however you like it, and they will switch out the burger patty for a Gardenburger or a Vegan Boca Burger. What?!?! That's so exciting! No more awful, bland veggie burgers. My favorite burger is the Whiskey River, but I'm a huge fan of the Burnin' Love and the Blue Ribbon (minus the weird tangy sauce; I think it clashes with the blue cheese). Now, if you are a strict vegetarian or vegan, I'm not exactly sure about their cooking methods, but if you are just a pretty basic ""no meat and/or no cheese"" kinda person, you will have a blast trying all their burgers.

Solomon W.,"Austin, TX",516,2583,7,3.0,7/19/2012,"I'm gonna make an exception here: constructing a review of a chain outpost. This specific burger-based corporation has a few things going for it: it centralizes around artisan burgers, the fries keep on coming along until you are ready to puke out mashed potatoes, and quality service is really emphasized across the board. I just really wanted to get in for their ""summer special"", and this was actually my first time at Red Robin--Yummmm. Yeah, that's another fine aspect at this fine institution: a good jingle that pretty much everyone knows. That surely must be why they were winning some rowdy rewards for the ""Best Chains in America"" last year. A good win always makes for a winning experience. The Fiery Ghost burger boasted ghost ketchup, which was cloyingly sweet and possessed almost no sweetness at all. Let's break down the other components: fried jalapeno buttons and actual jalapenos. I don't know where The Crimson Bird gets these spicy green guys, but they were not spicy in the least. A disappointing burger. One complaint that many people voice here is the actual size o' the burger. Apparently it is on the fringe of being under 4 ounces. I cannot believe they are serving these small puppies at a full-service joint. Moving onto the ""full-size."" A little better, certainly more pricey--but at least you can customize the ""how do you want it."" No more than medium... please. But be wary of raw. At national burger eateries, they definitely utilize industrialized meat. OK, the true winner: unlimited fries. These suckers are for sure frozen and fried from the ice box, but whatever. All you can eat. And you get a bottle of Red Robin Sauce. I actually very much enjoy the Tavern Sauce--though it is pretty much like Thousand Island, it does give a nice tangy sweetness to your salt oil-cooked largely sliced tubers.

It's the only thing I  have ever ordered because for me, it's perfection. It's got crunch. It's got all the flavors I could ever hope for in a burger! Just thinking about it makes me want to run out and go get another one today! I just might have to pursue this plan further if my mouth continues to water. Pavlov's syndrome? Anyway, as you can tell by every other review... the fries are bottomless. I did notice that they serve less fries to start with which I LOVE. I used to feel like they gave too many fries at the start for them being bottomless.

I don't think my glass empty the entire time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington?start=60

Jamie H.,"Aberdeen, MD",144,467,169,4.0,5/24/2009,"Omg! I am very shocked no one has yet to review the new Red Robin in the Arlington Highlands. Well then, I was very amazed upon walking in to find service quite prompt. The last time I have been to a Red Robin was in high school and then, the service was eh. Not only were we seated right away, but our waitress was there with in a minute. She was very friendly and found out ""YES"" they do have clam strips.  So my hubster ordered a mushroom burger and I of course ordered the oh so coveted clam strips.  He thoroughly enjoyed his burger and most of my clam strips, even the manager stopped by (3 x's ) I hope it wasn't because I was wearing my Yelp Elite sweatshirt.  I will be back for more clam strips!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington?start=60
Bianca G.,"El Paso, TX",0,39,,4.0,11/18/2013,"There aren't any of this chain back home so the boyfriend convinced me to stop by. We went in late on a Friday, almost eleven at night. You could tell part of the restaurant was closed, but I requested a booth since we had my son and he was already asleep. They were very nice and accommodating. The food was great. The cheesecake was pretty good too. A good experience all around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington?start=80
David R.,"Hot Springs, AR",28,511,195,3.0,10/3/2011,Food is alright.  I had some sort of Chicken Sandwich with BBQ sauce on it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington?start=80
Katy B.,"Arlington, TX",0,20,3,5.0,10/9/2013,"I love this Red Robin!!!! Of course, Red Robin isn't the best food I have ever had, but that is not the point of going here. If I want a burger, or chicken sandwich at night, but don't want fast food, here is a good place to go to curb the craving. The people here were extremely nice, we came in 30 minutes til closing and left 30 minutes after closing, but we never felt rushed. Our waitress, Brittany, was extremely sweet and talked to us for a long while even though the restaurant was closed. I enjoyed the fries BECAUSE it didn't have seasoning on it. I eat a low salt diet, or try very hard to, and at other competitors places I have to wipe or shake all the salt off and it still tastes like a salt lick. Although other people might like that, I don't. With the seasonings on the side, you can control how much you want. That is a much smarter idea. Also, when it came to asking for gluten free buns, I did not know that they also fry their fries in a different fryer if you are gluten free. Not sure if that makes a difference but it is just a nice gesture. I got their pumpkin spice shake, and expected it to be extraordinarily sweet, but when I received it, it was as if it hadn't been sweetened at all. But, that was nothing to complain about for me because I loved it that way, it was a nice change. All in all this was a great experience, much better than that other restaurant where there is enough salt to preserve you for god knows how many years. Will definitely come back! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington?start=80
Hugh H.,"Fort Worth, TX",5,49,22,3.0,3/18/2011,"I had a combo turkey wrap with a side of tortilla soup.  It cost about $10.00.  My friends got burgers and fries and left nothing.  I left the dollop of sour cream which was on top of my soup, a little to much for me.  All-in-all it was fine and I would go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington?start=80
CJ H.,"Tarrant, TX",4,97,,4.0,10/6/2011,"Yuuuummmmm!  Royal burger, endless fries, freckled lemonade and fried zukes.  All I need to make a total glutton of myself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington?start=80
Amanda B.,"Balch Springs, TX",6,10,,5.0,6/11/2009,"This is a great ""burger joint""! Although I am not sure that what they serve could fall in the same class as most burger places. The burgers are great and a good size not too big. The fried zucchini was wonderful! I was a little shocked to find out the fries where all-you-can-eat, as one serving was plenty. Would definatly recommend using their special salt mix on the fries. Also, I was with a large party with lots of kids and the service was wonderful!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arlington?start=80
