Karen C.,"Hiram, GA",4,3,,2.0,12/17/2017,"Past TWO times I have been to this restaurant, the floors and bathrooms are so filthy- it make you regret you ate there. Never any toilet paper for the bathroom stalls ! I waited around for at least 10 minutes to get someone's attention in the middle of the aisle of the restaurant with a look of disgust and bewilderment.. still, no one was interested in asking me if they could help. One hostess looked me in the eye and then avoided me like the plague because she could tell I wanted something!  I understand everyone has a job and is busy... however the management should make their rounds to ensure the facilities are acceptable at the very least! As a side note, there was a huge chunk of ice on the floor- that someone ( waitress or waiter) had dropped. I almost slipped and fell on it- how does one NOT know that they dropped a hunk of ice approximately 5-6"" in diameter??",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn
Brittany M.,"Kent, WA",2,30,13,3.0,1/8/2018,Our server was fantastic & food was great! Front of the house rubbed me all the wrong way. They are completely unorganized... may have had a power struggle between the woman manager & her staff that was annoying to watch. My kids were getting stir crazy waiting 20 minutes when they ran out of chalk and balloons. They were very unfriendly and when they called our name the lady only gave us about 30 seconds to get over to her before she was ready to give our seats away. In my experience she should have got her butt out there and looked for us as we were in the corner and maybe even offered to lend a hand with 3 kids and a infant. Good thing our server was able to turn our experience around.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn

Amber B.,"Federal Way, WA",91,141,19,2.0,4/5/2017,"We came here for dinner on a Wednesday around 6:45 and it was quick to get in and get our drinks and orders in but that is when the waiting started... We waited a hugely long time for food. I asked for a refill on my drink (after it sat empty several times when the server came over) and the guy who asked if I need a refill (not our server) and was never to be seen again. After another longer wait, my server got it for me. Server asked us if we wanted more fries right after our food was delivered. We never got them. Actually she mentioned them several times and ""would be right back with them"" and 20+ minutes after her 3rd time of doing that (which we never saw her in that 20 minutes), she brought them to us as we were walking out. I should have taken the basket to my car and snacked on them on the way home.  Not impressed. She was friendly but the whole restaurant seemed off its game.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn
Robin W.,"Auburn, WA",20,50,33,1.0,4/4/2017,Went here for lunch on a Monday afternoon so it was not busy at all.  I was really wanting a burger and it was a toss up between five guys and here...should of went with five guys. Was seated by the hostess and waited about 15 minutes before our waitress came she took our drink order and returned about 10 minutes later.  We placed our meal order being very simple 2 burgers I opted for the mac n cheese burger and guest got a smokehouse burger.  We waited another 30 minutes for our food to come out and had to flag down waitress to refill water n beverages. Finally our food....we recieved cold fries which I had to send back and ask for fresh ones and burgers were dry n lack any flavour I choose not to send my burger back due to the time ive already spent in this establishment for the crap they put on the table at this point I was just trying to leave. This by far the worst red robins ive been to..the people who work here need to be retrained.  When we were exiting our table we had another server come introduce herself like we had jus sat down and she was ready to take our order keep in mind the table was full of dirty dishes etc as we were done eating. You would think that on a slow monday a establishment known for burgers could of at least produced good burger and some hot fries...really not asking for alot.

Charles M.,"Renton, WA",0,70,162,1.0,2/26/2017,"Came in to take advantage of my ""birthday burger"" as part of the Red Robin Royalty club.   I ordered Royal Burger w/ egg over easy and my wife the California chicken w/ 2 sides of Chipolte sauce but we started with wedge salad for appetizer.  Bryan was our waiter, but needs some training. He brought my coffee, but no spoon to stir creamer/sugar. I used my fork, but had asked for spoon........nothing. It was taking some time (20 mins) to get our salads but finally arrived. 30 seconds later our entrees showed up by another server.  I asked that they be taken back and kept warm as we just got our appetizer salads.  He took it back to kitchen area. 2 minutes later, the manager brings entrees back out.  I asked if he was the manager, he said yes. I asked why he was bringing out our entrees a 2nd time when we had just got our salads and asked to have them taken back to keep warm. FYI RED ROBIN STAFF  appetizer defn: a small dish of food served BEFORE the main part of a meal.  In most restaurants salads are served first and after finished, the entree is brought out but not here.  Manager apologized and said he would have new orders made up. I asked for a spoon for my coffee which Bryan still had not brought. He said he'd get it. Nothing came.  Our entrees were brought out. The bun was off to the side so I started to align and realized that the egg white on top was uncooked and raw.  WTF?  FYI RED ROBIN STAFF Over easy definition, (of fried eggs) turned over when nearly done and fried briefly on the reverse side so that the yolk remains somewhat liquid but with a thin firm layer on top (NOT RUNNY WHITE SLIME RUNNING DOWN THE BURGER!!!) Manager came back over and asked if everything was ok, I said no, the egg white slime is running all over and it certainly wasn't cooked over easy, it was sunny side up.  I like a soft yolk, not a 1/2 raw egg.  I also pointed out that I was still waiting on the spoon for my coffee (now cold). He asked, ""Didn't he bring it out?"" If he had.....I wouldn't be asking for one.   He said he'd get one, 2nd time and he'd take care of the egg.   So I got to watch my wife eat her California chicken while I had to wait again for my entree.  I'm not sure they remade the burger but only recooked the egg as the burger was cold when I got it but at least the egg white wasn't running all over. I was so hungry at that point, I didn't care.  Bryan finally brought spoon and I pointed out that 1 of Chipolte sauce didn't taste spicy. It was visibly different than the spicy one, maybe it was 1000 island dressing.  He said he'd go switch it out.  It was taking quite some time & I thought maybe they had to make a new batch? My coffee ran dry and although Bryan walked by a couple of times and I put cup to edge of table, he didn't offer to refill. I had to walk back to kitchen to ask where I found him just chatting with other waiters.  He brought back coffee and I inquired about the Chipolte.  He said, he thought I'd just wanted it sent back. He said he'd bring it out, I said don't bother as we were done.  Nice timing though.  Manager took 20% off the bill, for my trouble, but won't be back here again. My wife said she even told the Bryan it was my birthday so they'd bring out desert and sing Happy Birthday. That didn't happen either.  Red Robin use to be a nice place to go for a good burger with fairly decent service but not anymore especially this one.  The waiter obviously needed more training, but manager really wasn't any better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn
Brett W.,"Bonney Lake, WA",1,58,19,1.0,6/22/2017,"This review is a combination of the last three times we've been here.  We should have seen the writing on the wall when the Red Robin HQ decided to ""re-brand"". That was really the beginning of the downfall. RR used to be built on great customer service. You knew the wait staff would bust their ass to give you a great eating experience. Not any more. A ten minute wait is common now after you are seated to hear from your server. Refills rarely happen. It seems like every person on the staff just started and they aren't sure how to do their job.  I really wish my kids didn't like the mac and cheese so much so I didn't have to come here any more. It has become a tradition that we go to RR for their birthday, but the staff last night didn't seem to really care about the Happy Birthday song, which is lame. RR used to be about service and great food. Now even the food has fallen off a bit. Going to avoid this place as much as possible. What was a really unique, kid-friendly, great restaurant has become just another place to get okay food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn

First we were told the wait would be about 25mins...ok no big deal. Nope an hour....we get a seat....another hour in and we still don't have our food. The manger( Iam guessing) who mind you lacked no skill in customer service what so ever. Came to ""check on"" us. She did nothing. While she is talking to us someone Slams my drink down on the table(that goes all over) and walks away. Ok by this point everyone is done. We got so fed up we got up paid for our drinks and left. This makes me sad  I was out for my friends birthday. Pretty sure thats not how they wanted to spend it. I've never had a bad time at a red robin till tonight.

Cesar R.,"Pacific, WA",0,6,4,1.0,3/23/2017,"I wouldn't have expected Red Robin to go from such a past preserving restaurant to the modern day chain burger joint. Their food quality has diminished to that of Jack in the Box. I used to love their bottomless fries as a little kid! They would be fresh and burn your tastebuds as you ate them. Nowadays, their fries are microwaved it seems. Soggy and dull, like the frozen ones you eat from Wal-Mart when you're stoned. Not to mention my burger was unsatisfactory. The meat lacked flavor and my condiments were lacking freshness. Seemed like someone just threw lettuce on my plate as well. I probably won't be coming back again. Ever. Too pricey for lame burgers. I'll just get high and get some Wendy's next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn
Andrew F.,"Surrey, Canada",80,105,24,2.0,9/19/2016,"Good franchise, bad execution.  BBQ sauce wings were decent. My draft beer was also ok, but seems a bit watered down or the taps just need a little cleaning. My southern charm burger had amazing flavours. Bacon was sweet, and the onion topping was flavourful. The burger itself, kind dry. Overall, burger was OK. The dry meet kinda threw me off. Fries were OK.  -mild ranting and thoughts- Servers were very apologetic and tried their best to address some issues we had (late food, late drinks, etc). These things happen, so I'm pretty good about that, especially when it's a full house. So that's good. However, it was not busy, so why are you putting your servers in this position to begin with? There was a problem with communication between patron and staff. Please look into this.  Please remove the one centre table that is closest to the kitchen. It creates a narrow high traffic laneway for your server and guests to walk through. When your servers need to float drinks and food over the guests' head to get to the other side of the room, that's a problem. Your restaurant is not at capacity, consider using your space effectively.  $2 entertainment fee for the tablet/menu/game? Tablet sitting on the table, not being used by anyone. Your innovation should be used elsewhere. Don't find new reasons to charge your patrons. Period.  As noted by other reviewers, clean the tables in a timely manner. Doesn't have to be immediately, but...maybe within 30mins. Consider hiring a busser.  -rant over- Red Robbin is usually a pretty consistent and well run company. However, Auburn location, step your game up and fix these issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn
Matt S.,"Beaverton, OR",122,3,,1.0,10/3/2017,"We went to this Red Robin for my daughters birthday dinner. We waited for 20 min to be seated (which was no problem) and sat down. We then sat for 55 minutes with not ONE person coming over to take drink orders or food orders. We asked 3 different people for help and all we got back was ""sorry we are short staffed today."" When we got up to leave I went to the floor manager who was hard at work on her IPad and let her know we were never served in 55 minutes and we were leaving.

Rob H.,"Federal Way, WA",30,15,,1.0,11/25/2017,"We eat at Federal Way Red Robins on a regular basis and its always a great experience. Auburn however, was the worst I've ever experienced at a Red Robin. While the restaurant was fairly busy with Christmas shopping, we only had to wait for 15 minutes to get a table, but then sat for over an hour waiting for our meal. We would have been more understanding, but the food was warm/cold by the time it got to us. Anything we asked for took forever to happen or never did happen at all. The table next to us came in a good 45 minutes after us and had their appetizers within minutes and their meals shortly after. Fortunately for them, they had a different server. We finally got tired of waiting and asked another waitress to help with a couple things and she was right on it. She apologized for our waiter as he was new and had to deal with 8 tables. While I understand he might have been overwhelmed, he spent most of his time in the food service area, not out on the floor taking care of customers like the rest of the help. At one point, after receiving cold food after waiting an hour, I went to complain to another staff member. All I could find that wasn't another wait staff was the hostess. I told her about our issues, and she told me she she wasn't the manager and couldn't do anything about it. She said she could get a manager, but after her initial response, I was totally disgusted and told her to never mind. To finally top it off, we used the EMV to pay and sure enough, there was no receipt paper. Figures. Now coming to yelp, I see that Yelp reviewers have given this an average of 2.5 stars. I wonder why its so high.  O_o",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn?start=20

Tonight a blonde female server forgot the lime for my corona, then went on to do a bunch of other stuff while I sat in front of a beer that I couldn't drink. She handed off our table to a guy named Will. Super nice guy, but he forgot the silverware, then went on to do other stuff while I sat in front of food I couldn't eat. When the silverware came, it was dirty.  When I dug into the macaroni, it had no sauce on it. It was just noodles and cheese, they had forgotten the sauce. That's two servers and the kitchen who all dropped the ball.  He brought a replacement, but it had sauce and not the delicious burnt crispy cheese that was the only good part of the sauce free version. The salad was clearly out of a bag, which is common in a chain, but the lettuce had been frozen and was brownish and a little slimy.

NR W.,"Seattle, WA",0,6,,2.0,8/7/2017,"Been to the new remodled Red Robin several times at different locations. The Avocobbo salad has changed for the worse, smaller and not as as beautifully laid out as before. Added different lettuce greens that are like chewy weeds. The ceramic square ""bowls"" they use for soup are too shallow to keep soup hot and three times I've gotten lukewarm clam chowder. This last time it must have sat for awhile because there was a filmy coating across the top where the soup had dried out. Yuck. What's up with the BLTA? Croissant is old or subpar, very dry and uncroissant-like. This is at different locations so its not the same cook every time.

We didn't know how to sign in with our rewards number since we have an account without a card. We also didn't know that you get charged $1.99 for using the tablet on the table. They call it an entertainment fee which is ridiculous in my opinion. Anything to make a dollar I guess. Our food was very good, but our service could have been better.  We ordered side salads that came at the same time as our meal. So our fries were cold by the time we were done with our salads. I also didn't get my dipping sauce.  The waiter, I didn't catch his name, was very soft spoken and you could barely hear him over the loud restaurant noise. He asked how we wanted our burgers cooked and I said I wanted mine with pink and my husband wanted no pink.

Brie W.,"Renton, WA",184,132,3,2.0,7/7/2016,"Went here with my son before he had his 18m appointment at the doctor. We were all excited to have fries and chicken.  We walked into the restaurant and two women were scrubbing the sign in board on the podium because someone wrote on it with a silver metallic marker...yes, I heard all of this because no one realized I was there nor dos they care after they looked up to see me holding my small child. Sad.   We were taken back to a platform table in the back of the restaurant where I needed a high chair. Little do they understand, is that when the high chair is placed at the table, it's about 6-8inches away and my child won't be able to reach the table. When I asked for a 'regular height' table, I was given the death glare and the hostess walked away. Granted, she looked like someone off the street. No uniform, and clearly no manners.  I ordered a bbq chicken wrap with no cheese, and fries. My son ordered the chicken stickens with mandarin oranges. When the food arrived after 25 minutes (my son was not happy by then), I noticed that my wrap tasted funny. I knew what was missing, the ranch/sour cream they put in the wrap. She almost acted like she knew it was missing, went over and got a dish of ranch and said sorry. Uhh...this was made wrong. If I wasn't short on time, being we had to be somewhere and small children only last for so long in a restaurant, I would have spoken up.

She asked me if I want a birthday sundae to go- lol.  Everyone else around us with different waitresses literally came after us, got their food after us, and paid and left before us. And they had bigger parties. I'm so disappointed, I usually like to come here for lunch or to watch the game, I will literally never be back. The most horrible service by Caitlin.

The food here has always been sub-par to me. I'm not a huge hamburger fan so I never order burgers. Usually I get clucks & fries - which isn't any different than any other chicken strips. Their fries are pretty good & dipped in ranch...yum.  Tonight I got their soup & salad, the chowder wasn't anything spectacular. I can get the same stuff in a can at the grocery store. The salad was gross, I hardly ate any of it.  I don't mind eating here, this location has always been great service. & I know the clucks & fries are an okay go-to when someone suggests this restaurant.

What could've been a easy hour dinner ends up being 2 hours long.  Our change took forever.  But it seems that managers are too busy talking to their hostesses, rather than just going & changing TVs when a patron asks their server 3Xs first & can't get the manager to change it.  I finally walked over & asked the manager.  He still took another 6 min. to change the TV.   Portions on these specialty sandwiches, needs rethinking.  What happened to the cute silver fries cup holder ???  Big Disappoint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn?start=20

I love that when you bit into the onion ring the onion does not fall apart. :) I had order one of the new burger and I must say it was ono.. Lots of flavor, but it is a bit messy.

Bruce F.,"Milton, WA",69,632,210,3.0,12/4/2014,Of the two local Red Robin's - this is our preference (gave the other one 2 stars).    We have been coming to Red Robin for over 40 years and have watched them slowly go downhill. The burgers are OK - not as thick as I recall and although you can still get them pink inside - they are not always juicy.   I called ahead to let them know that 9 of us were coming so they could consider getting tables together but they said  - not something they do.   NOTE - I was not expecting a reservation but when they are seating for the next 10 minutes they could keep the large group in mind and start planning.   Service is marginal half of the time but if you call for a manager - they will usually try to make it right.    The ambiance is fun and the kids do love it.   (come on a night when the Red Robin visits)    I might be comparing this to upper end chains and I need to reduce my expectations down to the lower ends - slightly above fast food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn?start=60

There are all kinds of burgers, salads, alcoholic beverages, and desserts.  We got excellent and timely service, just not very accurate service. We got our food pretty quickly, but it wasn't correct. The staff kept bringing us wrong food. One of my dining partners requested a lettuce-wrapped burger, but it came out with a bun. He also received regular fries instead of sweet potato fries. Another dining partner got dressing on the salad when it was asked for on the side. Then, there was the wrong sauce brought to the table several times. I guess they were just having an off day.

I figured my family had been seated so I'd go find them. Turns out they were in the bathroom. We went back out front to find they'd skipped over us as we weren't In the lobby. I told the staff they were oblivious when I walked in and they said we thought you were going to the bar. Really?! I said how would I go to the bar with a toddler to which their response was we can't see kids over the podium.

There was a large birthday party going on and this seemed to be the main cause of her stress. She approached our table, (we had been sitting down for about 3 minutes), and told us that we needed to hurry up and order our food because of the birthday party going on...and that she'd take care of the drinks later. She even said....""hurry, hurry, hurry"". I was a little shocked, but most of us knew what we wanted so we tried to accommodate. One of the kids in our group had a hard time deciding, so she approached him and talked him into getting the chicken strips. She had the same urgency when she got our drink order. We got our food. The food was really good. That is the positive I am taking from this dining experience.Then she came over and proceeded  to tell us that the large birthday party table didn't have their food yet and it was a good thing that we ordered in a hurry. (I actually think that she thought she was practicing good customer service, which is shocking to be honest. )When we got our check, I asked her if I could just use the kiosk and she proceeded to show me how to use it, (completing the survey for me, btw), even though I told her three times that I already knew how to use it.

There isn't a lot of onions and chunks of veggies in there veg patties. She also got the garlic Parmesan fries but she said they were bland and didn't have much seasoning on them. We got the chili cheese fries for an appetizer and they were ok. The cheese and chili wasn't mixed with the fries, everything was on top so as you got down more into the dish they were plain fries. As for myself I got a chicken Cesar salad. It was pretty bland with the dressing as it tasted watery. The chicken was actually really good, soft juicy and a nice size portion. I also got a cup of tortilla soup which tasted watery as well. Ther service wasn't good as our waitress seemed overwhelmed with customers.

Which wasn't too bad considering the number of people waiting. While in the lobby we witnessed the two hostesses bickering, eye rolling and trash talking about each other to co workers. After about 30 minutes of waiting, a seat opened up in the bar so we seated ourselves. Our waitress was rude from the start. We were a complete bother to her. We all ordered pub burgers and one of my friends ordered a salad. The salad was slid across the table by our waitress without a word, as she went by. It was impossible for my friend to eat her salad because we had no silverware at our table. Our waitress had seemingly disappeared. We flagged down another waitress for silverware. Which was brought by our waitress, who had  reappeared, and delivered with an eye roll. Only for us to look and find that we has been brought dirty silverware. Literally looked like it had been cleared off a table and brought to us. We flagged her down, yet again, asking for clean silverware. Other eye roll. Five minutes later, we were brought what seemed to be the same silverware, plus the fingerprints where someone had tried to rub off the food.  Now comes our burgers, flung onto the table. Mind you, my friend is now eating her salad with her fingers. We have been in the restaurant over an hour by this point. The burgers looked like someone had put them together by throwing food onto the bun, sloppy! I took 3 bites of mine before biting into grizzle.

Steph R.,"San Clemente, CA",1,21,2,2.0,11/12/2016,"Overall, the restaurant was clean, the food was as expected, and the server was nice and attentive. However, the 2 stars is because of a mess-up at the host stand- that apparently no one thought to apologize for.  We showed up with 4 adults, a hungry 5 yr old, and a hungry 1 yr old. We put our name in- and watched them type in our name and indicate +1 high chair. They said 25-30 mins, so we took a seat right up front by the host stand.  Around 35 mins goes by, and I have to take the hungry/grumpy kids outside because they're so restless. The rest of our group stays inside, right in front of the host stand. The hosts never thought to ask why we were standing there, or for how long.  Finally, after almost an hour, someone from my group asks them why they keep seating groups who got there way after us-- they try to tell us that we weren't on the list...Too bad 3 of us saw her type our name in. When they finally realized their error, They didn't seem too bothered by it, and sat us soon after.

My salad had barely any lettuce and more condiments than anything else and bottomless fries were not bottomless as we waited 20+ minutes for more.

The bill came $79, and my husband gave the waitress his credit card. We didn't realize that they charged us for the burger they had to remake (they charged us for the burger they threw away). After we pointed out the discrepancy the waitress said they ""comped"" the burger... which was funny to me because nothing was comped we paid for everything we ordered and they charged us for an extra meal. Long story short this wasn't a very good experience, but we had our kids with us so I made the choice to NOT make a scene.

Nam N.,"Renton, WA",677,804,135,2.0,1/11/2014,"i'm deducting a star for Red Robin in general - They used to be a fan place to grab a burger, bottomless fries, and kind of care free fun.  In the recent months of my coming back, I've noticed numerous changes.  The menu is becoming more ""fancy"" as it's a booklet style similar to Cheesecake Factory.  The bottomless basket of fries is now a metal cylinder with no bottom that typically holds about 10 fries at best.  The (my personal former favorite) Royal Red Robin Burger is now served as an ""open face burger"" and the egg is cooked over easy contrary to the original over hard.  Red Robin no longer carries Tabasco but as switched over to Cholula.  The overall quality of the burger and fries seemed to have gone down a touch while prices have jumped about 50 cents. Call me old school and a bit nostalgic for things of the past but I enjoyed getting my burger and fries in a basket.  It's more comfortable and fun.  I don't care to pay a little more to make things look fancy on a plate.  Red Robin prior to changes had some of the best steak fries around!  Now in my last two visits, they've been a little soggy and just small end pieces that are either soggy or over cooked.   Burgers have different breads that I wasn't aware of.  And why can't my egg still be cooked over hard?  Over easy is the only option you have, I personally don't like yoke dripping off my burger when I eat, you don't taste the egg anymore. Freckled lemonades used to be full of strawberries now you're lucky to get more than a few chunks and it seems more watered down as well. Cholula is NOT hot sauce.  It's tangy.  I know it's a matter of personal preference but I miss the hot heat spice of Tabasco.  Why not have a choice?  Why make it one or the other?? I could only guess this is corporate's way of cutting costs by switching to a different brand of hot sauce, lessening the amount of fries in front of people so non-burger orders cannot share bottomless fries by limiting how many is served at a time and to slow down people literally eating all the fries they can.  Also raising the prices by a small margin of 50 cents won't deter a consumer from eating but definitely pays for the revamp of the new menus and the plates the food comes on as well as boosts profit margins. /rant.

Sometimes I think my expectations are perhaps a little high for what this chain restaurant is capable. The bad first- The service is always hit or miss. Sometimes you get an energetic and engaging server on a slow night and everything goes smoothly. Sometimes you get a burnt out server at the end of a double shift with a full section.  Now, the good- The food is consistently decent. The ""gourmet"" in their name might be misleading. Yes, they have bot traditional and funky burger creations with interesting flavors, but don't expect Iberico ham or duck eggs. The ambience is good for kids. My little one can stare for hours at the nostalgia on the walls and even when it's busy I never feel like it's terribly loud. Oh yeah- Bottomless fries.

Amanda S.,"Cheney, WA",2,12,6,2.0,4/17/2016,"My boyfriend and I have gone to this location of red robin a few times, and have had only one friendly waiter (Thaddeus.) We came here for dinner once on a Friday night around 7, so it was super busy. I got my refills on my lemonade without having to ask, and our food was out within 30 min. This is when Thaddeus served us. The next time we went (today,) was a Sunday night and there were only a few tables filled with about 6 waiters on duty (more than one waiter per table.) At first, our waitress was friendly and brought our drinks right away. After we ordered is when the service went to shit. We waited over an HOUR for our food on a slow Sunday night when they were overstaffed and when it finally came to us, it wasn't even fresh. My burger was luke warm, the fries were burnt and old, and my boyfriends bun was hard. I ate about half of my burger (I usually eat all of it, but I was hungry so I ate some) and my boyfriend had like one bite of his. We didn't even have napkins and silverware brought to us until I had to ask the waitress for them after we got our food, ate some of it, and made a mess. We also had to ask twice for buzzard sauce, and the waitress never once apologized for the food taking so long (even though it's not her fault.) On top of all of this, after I asked for the buzzard sauce for the second time, the waitress dropped a menu and (jokingly) blamed it on me. I realize she was trying to be funny, but I definitely don't think it's appropriate to joke like that when you know the customers are already upset and have been waiting for their food for an hour.

The larger fries were soggy, and the broken pieces were rock hard.   The restaurant itself was loud and crowded, overflowing with staff running about but not seeming to be doing much to help with the masses waiting to eat.  If the restaurant's goal was to create a crazy atmosphere, they succeeded.  My fellow diners and I were seated at a tiny booth next to the kitchen.  Not only was there a large open space looking into the kitchen about head height next to me, during the entire meal we could not hear ourselves speak due to the loud sounds and voices coming from the kitchen.  When I curiously peeked in, it was cluttered- stacks of bowls and plates of salad covered the counters.   Several minutes after being seated, our waitress brought the three of us two forks and one knife.  It took a long while for our food to come, and once we were served, our waitress only stopped by once to check up on us and, although our drinks were low, did not refill them until we were leaving.  When she brought us our bill, we were ready to pay almost instantly, but couldn't find the waitress anywhere.  After about ten more minutes, we managed to pay and leave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn?start=80

Finally she turns around, and without a single apology, she asks with an attitude, ""what do you want to drink?"".... The guy next to me orders a beer, and looks over at me and says ""I didn't realize I was such an inconvenience around here"". That sucks. So finally my to-go order is ready, (25 minutes late)... I get home, and it's the wrong order. The receipt even says guac burger... And I have a turkey burger. Again, I call the manager to let them know what bad service is being provided at their restaurant... And I talk with Alex again. And again, Alex could care less. The reason I'm giving two stars is because their food is so good. The cooks do a good job in the kitchen. Good burgers and fries... just crappy service, and a manager who should care a little more. I don't know when I will be back. Maybe when they get some new employees, and a new manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn?start=80
Susan W.,"WA, WA",125,621,1485,3.0,6/14/2011,"So after going to the Southcenter location to score the $6.99 5 Alarm Chicken Burger & enjoying it, I talked my friend Amy into going there for lunch last week.  I was treating her because it was her birthday.  We got there at approximately 12:45pm and they were super busy!  Recession???  Not here.  Got squeezed into an awkward table in the middle of the restaurant.  It was VERY LOUD!!  Much louder than any other RR I have ever been in.  Not sure why.  Acoustics or noisy people down in Auburn. Anyway....   My 5 Alarm Chicken served ""protein style"" (wrapped in lettuce leaves instead of a bun) was yummolicious!  I think If they put guacamole on it I would order it for the rest of my life!  Because I skipped the calories of the bun I went for the fries.  ;)  I rate all fries against RR fries.  They are my fave!  You have to get ranch dressing to dip them in.  :)  I was not happy that my sandwich was served in the plastic basket with waxed paper lining.  If you get the ""protein style"" burger make sure they serve it to you on a plate.  Eventually you will have to give up on eating it with you hands & use a fork and knife.  When you eat it in the basket you might eat waxed paper.  Yuck!   My friend had the turkey avocado croissant sandwich with side salad.  Looked fantastic!  She got the new pesto ranch dressing for her salad & it was tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn?start=80

Not only did they not bring out the kids food first, they brought the drinks but not the milks. So table with starving kids, and everyone else has drinks but them. Took 2 hours from the time we walked in the door until the time we got our food. Unbelievable. I don't know why we have to tip, everything is done through the screens at the table and the runners bring out the food. Miserable experience.

Kelly L.,"Bonney Lake, WA",0,1,,1.0,2/28/2016,"This is a difficult review to write because I have always enjoyed Red Robin in the past.  But our last visit earlier this week was very disappointing.  We were seated quickly in the newly refurbished dinning room which I thought was a big improvement from the busy Americana theme. The feel of the new dining room is really the only reason why I gave them two stars. It ends there. I'm going to begin my rant by saying I can't stand the video monitors at every table. Is this really necessary? Most of us spend way too much time in front of our smart phones, iPads, video games and televisions.  Of course, my children were drawn to the video monitors immediately. I put the stupid thing on one of our empty chairs. My next gripe was the ridiculous bells and buzzers going off in the kitchen constantly.  And the buzzer didn't ring for 5 - 10 seconds. No, the darn things kept going all night for 30 seconds at a time, not to mention they were very loud. No reason to have the alarms going off like that continuely, no matter how many french fries they're frying.  Then there was the manager standing directly behind me going over the nights staffing level and floor seating grid. I turned around because I was in shock they were talking so loud, so close.  The manager saw me turn around and look at them, "" Oh, sorry folks"" and continued on with their discussion. The serve reached across myself and my daughter to serve the two other meals. Really? Take two steps around the person and place the plates directly in front of each person. Terribly rude to reach in front of people. Had to ask for refills on ice tea, drinks more fries. I was beside myself by the time I walked out of the restaurant.

It isn't too expensive, you get a good burger and their drinks are delicious (non alcoholic and alcoholic). Tonight when we arrived there was a big sign on the door that their liquor license has been suspended for 5 days due to sale of alcohol to a minor and they won't be serving alcohol again until the 26th. Luckily, I'm pregnant and wasn't there for a drink, just a bacon cheeseburger.  The host asked if we were over 21, we said yes and she sat us in the bar. Even though there's no alcohol I thought it was a little funny that she just asked if we were over 21 and didn't check ID, while their liquor license is suspended. We were helped quickly, they brought drink refills without being asked and brought fry refills without being asked. My husband got the wing appetizer and loved it. I got a lettuce wrapped bacon cheeseburger and the burger was done perfectly, the bacon was a little limp and sad but for $31 including my husbands shake, it cured the bacon cheeseburger craving.

So as a group of 4 we ordered more..  again supposed to be bottomless... well we got no drink refills and again after waiting another 20+ minutes we got 2 baskets with 5 fries in each.  Seriously???  Not so bottomless on the fries...  The restaurant was packed and busy so there was junk all over the floor, screaming kids and it was loud from too many people talking at once.

Amberly P.,"Salem, OR",101,97,37,3.0,4/14/2015,"Stopped in for my boyfriends birthday on Sunday and was a little irritated because pretty much nothing went right. We ordered our food and I ordered a side of buzz sauce and parmesan cheese. I didn't receive the parmesan cheese so I waited until our server came by to ask but she didn't drop our food off so she was nowhere to be found. About ten minutes went by and she finally came to check on us. I reminded her about my side that was forgotten and she disappeared for about 15 more minutes. Finally returned with two half full sides of it. By then my drink was empty. She ran off before I could ask for a refill. Finally when she came back, we asked for refills and then she brought me two diet cokes in a row, when I ordered regular coke. I was trying to be polite and courteous, because it seemed to me that she was new. For that reason, I won't say her name. But I think better training needs to happen or something.. Or don't leave new employees to themselves until they're comfortable. Anyways, when I told her that my second coke was in fact diet, she argued with me and said it was not diet. Mmmkay. So since it was my boyfriends birthday, she said he'd get a birthday sundae which he also never got. We ordered the dessert and asked to have it as soon as it was ready, but we had to ask for it three times after we were long finished with our food.

We were in the bar area and it seemed a little chilly.  I wore my jacket through the meal and looking around, I saw other people wearing theirs.  Restaurants should be cozy and comfortable.  They had this computer on the table and we were encouraged to play games (for a fee), order and pay on the thing.  One way to cut staff and generate some money.  Also, I was sitting on a high bench against the wall, which kept wiggling around and I was afraid it was going to dump me.  The noise level was OK, however, and we did not have to scream at each other over sports or music.  For two and a half beers, a french dip and a salad, plan to spend about $55.  For a $55 meal, we left with more complaints and disappointment than compliments..  We will not be coming back here.  There are better places in Auburn.  I don't know if all the Red Robins are this way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn?start=140

We decided to sit in the bar to see if there were any Happy Hour specials.  My boyfriend ended up with a bottle of Heinekken and I went for the Absolutely Absolut Freckled Lemonade (basically their Freckled Lemonade spiked with some Absolut Vodka).  As for our entrees, I decided to be good and have the Crispy Chicken Tender Salad and my boyfriend was feeling meaty and went for the Riblets and Clucks combo.  Our waitress was very sweet and checked up on us frequently as she was also our bartender.   When our entrees came out, I was very pleased with my salad especially with having the poppyseed honey mustard dressing on the side.  And we were surprised by my boyfriend's combo being so small for almost $14.  I was content with my salad.  As for my boyfriend, he was somewhat disappointed by the portion of his meal.  The riblets were a little on the dry side, but I have to admit... I'd prefer these over Applebee's riblets.  And the clucks were just as usual.

The people were friendly, wait staff was decent, had to ask for refills a couple times but it happens. Be ware, this place gets pretty busy on the evenings...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn?start=140
collin h.,"King, WA",14,15,,5.0,3/30/2010,"WOW! At this place they have a guy dressed up in a Red Robin Costume and he hands out balloons to the kids. Now this may sound creepy to some, but where I come from, it's just good clean all-American fun. High 'n' tight. I LOVE the decore. motocrycle,s , billboard, Bikini Babes, Novelty License Plates, and I always eat the Shrimp'n'Cod duo. 2 pieces of gently battered fresh-from-the-sea Cod, coupled with a flavorful cornocopia of Shrimp, all on a sumptuous bed of golden brown, greasy, all-American rootin' tootin' hold-the-cloeslow Frech Fries, marinana on the side, YES Please! 'Cuz I like it that way! In the immortal words of the Backstreet Boys, yes, ""I want it THAT way!"" Also on the menu, they have the Tower of Onions, Onion Rings, that's a meal fit for a King, it's a tower with fat Onion Rings at the bottom a nd they get smaller up at the top, like a big cone, like a spear of onion rings. This Baby is SHARP and ready for action. Grumble grumble, that;s my belly LOL Even sharper still are my incisors that I use to TEAR into these Juicy, Grade-A, Marbled all-American Grain-Fed Shade-Grown Pasterurized 3/4lb processed medium rare Hamburger Pattys. yes, Sir, these boys are made for eatin'. RIP into that char-grilled down-home flavor. I like em without pickles. Service is here usually pimple-faced High School kids, they all sing Happy birthday to you, they do colorful fun and games with the kids, they wear headsets, and some of them have made off-color jokes to my grandmother (NOT COOL, she's 85, dude).  I don't like the colore Red, I don't really like Robins, but let's face it, this place has neither one, they oughta call it Hella Good Burgerz'n' Babes, don't ya think!?!?!?!? Can I get a WHAT-WHAT!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn?start=140

Katrina C.,"Tacoma, WA",0,4,,1.0,2/16/2014,"Food was terrible. Between 4 orders, three were messed up.  Worse yet, a chicken burger was partially raw.

Bettina B.,"Auburn, WA",11,178,2,3.0,8/13/2012,"Once you've been to one Red Robin you've been to them all. The burgers are ok, I like the buffalo style chicken strips and fries....or clucks and fries I guess is what they are called. The service is usually pretty good. On a different note I got an electric watermelon here and it was the best one I've ever had!! Happy Hour before a movie was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn?start=140
Brian D.,"Federal Way, WA",8,21,4,5.0,10/5/2012,"I was very amazed by the level of service I received from my waiter Lukas, I eat out almost every day and here at Red Robin I received some of the best service ever, drink refilled before it was empty, very on top of the bottomless fries and seemed to be genuinely concerned that I was enjoying my food and enjoying myself, very awesome five stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn?start=140
John M.,"Bonney Lake, WA",0,5,,2.0,8/4/2013,"Haven't been to red robin in a while and I was surprised at how it has changed for the worse. Three of us had the signature red robin cheeseburger. They used to wrap them in a napkin. They don't anymore. They used to add a crisp piece of lettuce, an onion with some bite, and a slice or two of fresh tomato. They don't anymore. Now it is shredded lettuce, pieces of tomato and onion in name only. The burger itself used to be a juicy piece of meat. Now the patty is big enough but comes with the life cooked out of it. The fries used to be big steak fries but now they are just shards of steak fries but you can still have as many as you want. On leaving the waitress asked if I had had enough. I had to say yes. Enough for a lifetime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn?start=160
Michael G.,"Redmond, WA",8,5,,2.0,6/17/2014,40 minutes to get a seat. Appetizers took forever. This place always seems busy.

Sophia C.,"Kent, WA",30,18,16,5.0,9/16/2011,"This place gets 5 stars not because of the food because it's always just a place to go when you can't think of somewhere else but because of our server Kelsey. She was VERY attentive to us and the bar area was packed. The food might take a while to get to you but this time our service made up for it, again I must say that our server was amazing she even let me sample their new wine before trying it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn?start=160
Sylvia M.,"Auburn, WA",58,120,,4.0,3/21/2014,"Yesterday my family decided to give Red Robin one more shot.  We had never gone there during the week before, and we thought that might mean less of a wait.  Sure enough, no wait.  In fact, unlike previous times, we had an EXCELLENT super attentive server named Peirry.  She waited on us right away, she even recommended this new sauce they have, she brought it to go with our fries but did not charge us for it.  Our appetizer of cheesesticks and fried zuchinni was excellent.  Peirry kept our water glasses full, our burgers and fries were also cooked to perfection.  She brought us more fries than we could eat, which is a good thing as before we have had to flag down the server to get more fries and it would take forever.  The service was so fantastic I can't say enough good things about it!   If management is reading this, you need to give Peirry a raise.  She is the best server we have ever had and she was also making jokes!  So friendly, a great sense of humor and she knows her job!  We'd definitely go back on a weekday! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn?start=160

Me H.,"Seattle, WA",140,928,1020,3.0,4/2/2007,"Not one of the best Red Robin's around.  I ordered my usual, Whiskey River BBQ Chicken burger, fries EXTRA crispy with a side of ranch.  My basket arrives I have 4.5 fries, no ranch and one Whiskey River BBQ Chicken burger.  Fries were soggy and uncrisp plus I had less than five fries.  I quickly ask for my ranch along with a basket of extra crispy fries.  My chicken burger taste just like every other Whiskey River BBQ Chicken burger and I'm satisfied with that, Red Robin always seems to get their burgers right which is a good thing.  My extra fries arrive, they are smoking hot and crispier than my original but not extra crispy, I deal and eat a few.  Service was friendly the boys at the table seemed to enjoy checking out the servers butts which made for an interesting dining experience.  If you like soggy fries and girlie butts hit this Red Robin up, otherwise I say pass it up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn?start=160
