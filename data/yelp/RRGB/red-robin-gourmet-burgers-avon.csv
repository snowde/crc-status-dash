Jason J.,"Erie, PA",0,13,4,3.0,10/16/2015,"Food was decent. Service was fine. My big problem was there was 3 tables that had food on them with no customers when we got there. By the time we ate and left, those 3 same tables were still not cleaned off. This was at 2-3 on a Friday afternoon. Not that busy at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon?start=20
Paul N.,"Avon Lake, OH",0,91,8,4.0,5/6/2014,"My favorite burger chain. Had their teriyaki burger this time. Tasty flavor combo with the pineapple slice and teriyaki sauce. Wish they had a better craft beer selection (some RR's do). Many have the pay-at-the-table wireless devise (sorry, not this RR!). Who cares ... they have great burgers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon?start=20
Tim T.,"Avon Lake, OH",0,1,,5.0,3/30/2014,Always great service. Great food. It's a chain but they do it right. You will not be disappointed. If you are it's your fault.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon?start=20
Kylie H.,"Avon Lake, OH",0,12,4,5.0,6/21/2014,"I just had the BBQ chicken wrap. It was delicious! My mother got the BLT with French onion soup, but the French onion soup was so hard to eat, since it was in such a side bowl. I recommend getting it in a full size. Or not getting it as a side. The freckled lemonade is really good, but really expensive. Over all it was a great experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon?start=20
Brian H.,"Avon, OH",11,3,,5.0,11/1/2014,"I went to Red Robin the other night to get my free birthday burger. I got the Bleu Ribbon Burger, which was the best Bleu Ribbon Burger I ever got here. I ordered it medium and got it perfectly cooked, which usually gets over cooked at many restaurants. The fries were super fresh and was extremely impressed and even called the store after I got home to compliment the cook (Justin).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon?start=20
Elisabeth W.,"Franklin, TN",2,29,,3.0,7/10/2013,"We were in town visiting family and decided to grab a few burgers. We were seated quickly, but sat for a good 15 minutes before someone came to get our drink orders. She did apologize and the restaurant wasn't that busy to excuse the lateness of coming to our table. She asked if we'd been helped and I looked down at our empty table and politely said no.  Most often we get amazing service and the waitress was very nice that night so I can let what happened when we sat down slide.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon?start=20
Cynthia M. M.,"Amherst, OH",10,25,72,5.0,1/14/2011,Great service!  Best turkey burger I've had in a long time!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon?start=20
Mark G.,"Roanoke, TX",35,456,2,5.0,8/21/2008,An awesome burger chain originally from the great Northwest that keeps popping up everywhere.  I used to go to this place a lot back in the 80's when I was a kid.   The place always had the coolest arcade games back in the day.  Mountain High Mudd Pie has to be seen (and eaten) to believe.  To say the thing is big is an understatement.  Absolut Lemonade is a pretty good drink.    Fries and most non-alcoholic drinks are bottomless.  Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Burger is an epic win.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon?start=20
Rosa K.,"Westlake, OH",41,195,,5.0,7/14/2010,"Love the menu, they give you a huge amount on your plate. and the inside is very inviting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon?start=20
Wm M.,"North Olmsted, OH",0,38,,5.0,2/6/2012,"Service was very good, Food is good to. We like to eat here always try something new. We didn't have burgers this evening. I did miss the fries.  Had a wrap and a salad was filling.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon?start=20
M S.,"Lorain, OH",0,28,4,5.0,8/22/2017,YUMMM yyyyy!!!! My family and I have been to Red Robin quite a few times but today they out did themselves!!!! Burgers and fries were excellent. Our waitress was awesome. Thank you Nikki.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon
Andy R.,"Lafayette, IN",13,138,234,3.0,12/16/2016,"Tony was a great server, four stars for that fella. Thanks man, you've got some game in an otherwise boring establishment.  I think the best way to stomach Red Robin is in the bar section. Otherwise, you're subjected to happy birthday songs to the teeming hordes of white america, punctuated with screaming kids in claustrophobic seating conditions, all whilst bookended by brightly colored accent walls and randomly angled television screens. If Chuck E Cheese decided to open a burger joint, I can imagine this was one of that crazy rat's visions.  The food is OK, reminds me if Ruby Tuesday got frisky with a Friday's, but the love child product is a half-step below both parents. They have a lot of specialty burgers. I think the traditional sesame seed buns are mealy and lacking stability. A substandard platform for otherwise decent beef and chicken and toppings. Papa got the chicken and waffles sandwich, a nice offering but he said the sauce was too hot. Grandma got a grilled chicken breast with fancy sauce and a nice looking salad, which looked uptown compared to my cheeseburger and cold fries.  So the server was good, and the bar was well stocked with liquor and craft beers. The food was decent, largish menu so you can find something for anyone. Several gluten-free options present, and Tony was well-informed on food allergy issues. The seating area was too crowded and loud. The host staff was helpful. Overall a solid three stars, an as-advertised burger joint with laminated menus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon
Ashley M.,"Cleveland, OH",236,349,782,3.0,3/11/2017,"After spending hours in Costco. I just wanted some meat, so I stopped in with my sister and 5 year old niece. The staff was super friendly and the service was quick.  However, I wasn't thrilled with my chicken sandwich. The bin was soggy and it was lacking something. The fries were tasty and the lemonade was decent. Super bummed about the sandwich though. I didn't finish it and left hungry.  Will I be back? Probably, it's in a wicked convenient location. But, I wasn't happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon
Tony L.,"Elyria, OH",0,5,,4.0,5/22/2017,"The food is always fantastic. Our ""some pink"" burgers were fairly pinkless, which is the only thing keeping me from giving them the 5th star. Everything was awesome otherwise!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon
Alysha S.,"Nags Head, NC",8,7,3,4.0,4/5/2017,"Took the whole family here for dinner. My mushroom burger was delicious, the bottom bun was a bit soggy.

Libby S.,"Chantilly, VA",64,131,213,5.0,4/29/2017,"Came here with hubs while shopping,  the pretzel bites are nice and soft but the cheese dip is not so yummy... The chili is amazing and has enough kick to the tongue but doesn't roundhouse your face. I had the Mac and cheese which was really good, hubs had a burger which was great but he wished that our waitress asked how he wanted it, came out fine just the same. And the milkshakes are amazing! Get the monster size (fills your glass twice, massive portion)! Thanks again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon
Reel S.,"Westlake, OH",3,146,75,3.0,8/22/2016,This was a revisit used to come to Red Robin long ago until their burgers became overpriced overcooked. This trip I brought my two children we had a burger wings and chicken fingers explicitly ordered Wings to be crispy the waitress said no problem she must have left the food under the heat lamp when we got our food none of it was hot the wings were far from Krispy her smile was non-existent her attitude was poor the manager did take the Wings off the bill and remade them still never crispy food is still mediocre and overpriced the room was so loud you could not even hear yourself think from all the kids and families that they jammed in one back room would never come back this chain is overpriced and overdone,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon
Charity H.,"Sheffield Lake, OH",137,21,605,5.0,12/14/2015,"I'm not normally a chain-restaurant person, I'm a sucker for a good turkey burger and Red Robin has it down to a science. It's juicy and has that perfect grilled taste and I can get it on any burger topping combo they offer.  The service at this Red Robin is always great - the staff is always friendly, and several know us by name and our order even though we only come in about once or twice a month. Have a picky eater in your party? Don't hesitate to ask for things the way you want them - don't like pickles? Want your fries extra well done? Need some dipping sauce? No problem!  We've never gotten grief for asking and things have always come out correct. Perfect when taking the nephews out for a treat. Bonus for kids and kid-at-heart adults - with the redesign they did this fall, there're new decor to look at (I personally love the Pac Man inspired stuff and the pirate pose chart), little table top ordering machines that double as game consoles for a fee and there are portable chalk boards for game playing. And kids can get crayons and coloring sheets as well as a free balloon. I admit, when I first saw the little table top machines, I thought it would take away the personal touch with the server, but you are not required to use them and when you do it's not as odd/awkward as I thought it'd be. You can let them know you need drink refills (saving server a trip to table to ask) and pay for your check/see your bill at any time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon
Lynn F.,"Lakewood, OH",1,52,,3.0,2/4/2017,"Really disappointed in my last trip here. Previous visits have always been great, but this time was so bad that I don't think we'll go back.  Menu changed and they took off my favorite burger. No problem, I can just try something else. The burger wasn't bad but here's my issue...  We ordered a couple of their 'happy hour' drinks. Online they were listed at $3, our waitress told us they were actually $4.50 (which we were ok with), but when the check came they were $5.50. When we inquired with the waitress, she said, 'they must have raised the happy hour prices without telling us.' Honestly, you can't do that to customers. You need to honor the original price you tell them. This felt like a bait-and-switch. Service was SO SLOW. It took for-ev-er to get the check and then get my credit card back. Also, I know they're bottomless fries, but they give you a tiny amount to start, and if you ask for more it's at least a 10 minute wait.  For two average burgers and two drinks, after tip it was $45. That's way too high for a chain. If you're going to charge $14.50 for a burger, it needs to have more than 6 fries on the side and a patty a little larger than the palm of my hand.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon
Dale C.,"Avon, OH",3,3,,2.0,11/6/2016,On a Sunday. Stopped at the Red Robin in Avon. The food was great but the service had a hitch in its giddy up. Our server never came back to ask if we wanted a refill of fries until we were done with our burgers. My wife never received a refill on her lemonade. Very poor service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon
tom s.,"Brunswick, OH",0,75,10,3.0,10/29/2015,"For a restaurant that specializes in hamburgers I expected there burgers to be better than other places.  I had the Royal Red Robin and fries.  The burger was just average (not bad), and the fries came in a bottomless metal cup that looked pathetic.  There's more fries in a small order at McDonalds then what was in this cup.  Even though you do get an endless amount of fries, they can bring more than 8 stubby ones that didn't even reach the top of the cup.  The service and atmosphere was good, but I probably won't go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon
J. H.,"Avon, OH",23,207,16,4.0,2/2/2015,"Ate lunch here on a snowy Monday.  Not very busy, but that was not surprising considering the conditions outside.  We were promptly seated, and our waitress was at our table quickly. Food - you go to a Red Robin because the food is pretty consistent.  Decent burgers and great fries & onion rings.  This meal didn't disappoint. The X-factor with chain restaurants is the service.  I've had some poor experiences because of this, but our service here was excellent.  Food came out quickly to our table, refills were provided without asking, and the check came before I had to ask. Comparatively,  Red Robin isn't a 4-star restaurant, but for delivering on my expectations, they've earned it on this visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon
matt f.,"North Ridgeville, OH",0,5,,5.0,9/24/2016,I had the Whiskey River Grilled Chicken sandwich with the fruit salad as a side.  The chicken sandwich was excellent and probably my favorite thus far.  Can't wait to have it again.  Perfect combo of ingredients.  Also tried the Guiness Beer Shake and that was incredible as well!  Probably wouldn't get the fruit salad again as a side but wanted something a little healthier than fries even though I love steak fries so hard to resist.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon
William H.,"Fishers, IN",0,33,,1.0,6/18/2016,"Overpriced, small restaurant, uncomfortable metal chairs. Friendly but slow service. Busy shopping center - a lot of traffic, ok if you can make a right in and out - that's why I stopped.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon
Ian S.,"Amherst, OH",0,15,1,4.0,3/5/2015,"Unlimited fries, need I say more? Well.......ok. The food is pretty good for a burger joint. The only downside, if I had to say, would be some of the wait staff. I always love the food but sometimes waiting for my server to give us a refill or even the bill can be taxing. Especially during the time where we had to wait almost an hour for our bill, even though we were one of 3 couples in the restaurant at the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon
David C.,"Rocky River, OH",0,5,2,2.0,12/22/2015,"The food was decent except for my wife's soup which was cold.  She wanted wanted some hot soup on a cool December evening, and it arrived at room temperature.  Everyone else was done eating by the time she got a warm bowl of soup. But my real problem were these Ziosk terminals at each table.  I have never experienced anything like this at a restaurant before.  As soon as we sat down I grabbed it from my 3yr old and put it at the end of the table facing away from us up against a box of poinsettias.  At no time did we use the Ziosk terminal, but somehow moving it resulted in a $2 ""entertainment fee"".  The staff were quick to remove it from the bill, but it took a while for them to arrive at the table after paging them via the Ziosk.  This practice seems sketchy to me as I can see some people not reading the bill carefully.  Then I was forced to interact with the terminal to pay my bill via credit card.  I was surprised that it defaulted to a 20% tip which was kind of presumptuous, versus letting you specify the tip.  I always just do 20% of the food/beverage total and round up to the nearest whole dollar.   Additionally, the suggested tip was on the post-tax amount versus the food/beverage total.  Why would I tip on money going to the Great State of Ohio? Then, it wanted my email address to email me a receipt - I presume this is a ploy to fill my inbox with Red Robin spam.  So instead of opted for a printed receipt, but then the printer was jammed.  So twice I had to wait around for someone to help me with the Ziosk - once to remove the ridiculous entertainment fee, and other for a printed bill. I guess this is why I never go to chain restaurants, but I was desperate after some late night holiday activities and trapped in suburbia.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon
Greg E.,"Winter Garden, Orlando, FL",244,166,171,5.0,2/25/2014,let me tell you when you need a place to go to get an amazing burger. you better go to red robin. the greatest burgers ever and if you have a craving for fries get the bottomless fries and they mean bottomless because free refills how about that. and not to expensive either,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon

Jessica P.,"Atlanta, GA",664,511,287,3.0,9/16/2014,"I had a gift card so I checked it out. Not bad, but not too memorable either. It's a burger sports bar chain restaurant. I tried to be healthier by getting the lettuce bun and it worked well. The Bonzai burger was pretty tasty when tho I don't normally like teriyaki much. Broccoli on the side, completely plain and unseasoned which is fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avon
Harold S.,"Hayden, ID",5,85,64,4.0,6/14/2014,The service was great!!!! And the burgers are so good. And you can't beat the bottomless fries and strawberry lemonade. I was dissatisfied with the milk shake. The use soft serve ice cream for their shakes but regular ice cream is available. The shake tasted like cardboard.
