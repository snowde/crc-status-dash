LJ M.,"Bakersfield, CA",322,172,439,3.0,12/8/2017,"Okay, Red Robin... I am really really excited that they offer a VEGAN patty! However their veggie burger is advertised toward vegetarians, and if I hadn't looked online in advance, I wouldn't have known that the normal sesame bun isn't vegan (go for the ciabatta or lettuce wrap instead).  I went to Red Robin for the first time in the last several years last night, so I'm not sure if this review is a true depiction of the day to day. We waited about 10 minutes to even be put on the waiting list, as the hostess was busy. No problem- she was super apologetic and friendly, and we were seated within 5 minutes. My son (who is beyond picky) actually ate 3 bites of his veggie burger, and I devoured mine immediately. My partner had a meat burger which he liked. My fruit salad was pretty much just fruit cocktail from a can. The french fries were tasty though.  My biggest complaint was oddly the bathrooms. Toilet was overflowing and their was toilet paper strewn everywhere! Gross!  All in all I'm thankful for another vegan option and the service was decent. It's kind of a toss up if I'll be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bakersfield
Clara M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",97,9,4,2.0,12/19/2017,Horrible experience. They couldn't get the bill correct. The waitress kept giving everyone attitude and the managers were non existent ! The bread on my burger was hard and the bread on my other burger was soggy. You can tell the burgers had been under a heat lamp forever.  Correction : Manager just came to talk To us ( unexpectedly) and proceeded to defend the horrible customer service !  This is one of the reasons people stay away from the mall !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bakersfield
Leslie B.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,5,1,1.0,12/16/2017,"Honestly, I love Red Robin, but, the past two times I have gone to this location i have been very disappointed.         The first mess up was when i found a little bug in my alcoholic drink. It was just the floating in my cocktail. I alerted my waiter and he apologized and brought me a new one. It was all fine until towards the end of the drink and boom another one. I was disgusted and just wanted to leave. We got our bill and he charged me for the first drink that i didn't even take a sip of!      I didn't go back until a few months later...I decided to give it another go. Well i get my BBQ chicken wrap and there is a dark thick hair just sitting on top of the wrap. I mentioned this to my friends and family and they also have had similar experiences. It really sucks because it used to be my favorite place. They really need to step their game up or the Health Department needs to intervene at this point. It's not about being picky or snotty, it's about public health and sanitation. This is how germs and diseases spread people!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bakersfield

We found 2 seats at the bar and Amyee was our bartender. It was busy and she was a lone ranger pretty much, but she kept her cool, was on top of our drinks and food, she changed the channel to our football game and was just an A+ all around Customer Service employee.

Ryan O.,"Bakersfield, CA",16,129,71,5.0,10/10/2017,"I really dig this place. I will preclude this by saying that I have only sat at the bar here. I get the most wonderful and fast service when I do so why else would I sit elsewhere?  The food is always good. I usually get the Pig Out style Double Tavern and it is just as delicious as the first one I got. My gf usually gets something new each time and she never has any complaints of how the food has been cooked or assembled but sometimes she might not like the choice she made that day.  Bottomless fries! Who doesn't like bottomless fries and a good ranch sauce? This is a major factor in why I choose this place. Who else offers this? I sure would like to know so I can visit them as well.  Overall, it may not be the best quality food because it is a chain restaurant but I have never had a bad experience with the food, service or anything for that matter. It is definitely my go to in Bakersfield when I am around the mall area. Plus they have a decent craft beer selection.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bakersfield
Kenneth W.,"Bakersfield, CA",214,257,29,3.0,8/29/2017,"I'm not sure what I expected here, but it did not live up to what I was hoping for. Our waiter was nice, but this is one of those restaurants with a Ziosk. I feel that any restaurant I've been to recently with a Ziosk means that they expect their waiters to attend to more tables than what they would have otherwise. Maybe this is good overall, but I feel that we weren't checked on nearly enough (NOTE: I am not blaming the waiter/server, the waitstaff just does what they're instructed to do in a place like this.)  With that part mentioned, I should speak about what we really care about: food and drinks. Red Robin has lots of beers available to serve. They have a bar area as well. I am pretty sure that they have a full bar (I don't drink, so I am not 100% on this.) They also seem to serve craft beers based on the menus I did see. My children and wife are a fan of their ""freckled lemonade,"" which is strawberry lemonade with real strawberries in the drink. You can get it with regular Minute Maid Lemonade or the same brand's Light Lemonade. My kids ordered from the children's menu. One ordered a grilled chicken breast served on sticks with a side of broccoli. She usually eats broccoli, she spit this one out. She did enjoy the grilled chicken breast on sticks. She's two and though that was very cool. Kid #2 ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with a side of mandarin oranges. She's not a big eater, so I don't think the sandwich was the problem, but she took only a few bites of it and thought that was enough. She devoured the oranges. I ordered from their classic burger menu and ordered their burger with a fried egg and two strips of bacon on it (I don't recall its name.) I liked my burger, but I thought it was odd that I was never asked how I wanted my burger. I guess the only option is well done at this restaurant, because that is what my wife and I both received with our meals. My burger was alright and my fries were about the same, but they weren't so alright that I will be rushing back here. The wife ordered from their specialty burgers. I believe it was called the Mad Love burger. It looked delicious on the menu, but her burger was beyond well done and was actually split in half before it was served to her. She said that the burger was so overwhelmingly charred that she couldn't even taste the loads of other toppings. I sampled the jalapeno relish that came with her burger and that tasted amazing.  We ordered fries with both burgers. I thought that they did bottomless fries here, but we were never once asked if we wanted another serving. I'm not sure why. The fries that came with our order were lukewarm and stale. They required lots of ketchup to make them edible. Normally, I love the steak fries here.  All in all, it wasn't a horrible experience, but the experience won't be making us rush back any time soon. And if it wasn't obvious, I don't care for those Ziosks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bakersfield

I like to buy gift cards from here to give to my son every now and then, and their gift cards are always so cute. They have a variety of burgers and sandwiches and different flavored dips to go on either fries or burgers. You can pretty much add anything to your burger/sandwich to your liking, like bacon, egg, blue cheese etc. I've actually never had anything taste bad from here. The food, drinks, and alcoholic drinks are good.

Michael G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/28/2017,"I love Red Robin. This location is horrible. Stay away.  I arrived at 11am and was made to wait for 15 minutes for a table at an almost empty restaurant.  They showed me to my table and the room it was in had food all over the floor and the table had bits of food and crumbs from other mouths all over it. Again, it was 11 am, so nobody had sat there yet for the day. But the table and the whole restaurant was filthy.  I asked for the manager. She placed blame on a ""contract cleaning crew"" who didn't do their job right and then put me at another table. But I watched and they didn't clean the table or the floor and just sat someone else there a few minutes later.  When my appetizers arrived the plates they gave me were filthy. Chunks of food and sauces stuck to them. I again called for the manager. Their solution was to bring me new plates. After the appetizers were cleared from the table they got back to me with cleaner plates.  My burger was different from every other Red Robin I have ever been to. Small and with meager toppings. They gave me 11 french fries with it. Corporate needs to shut this place down yesterday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bakersfield

What a disappointment! This has no reflection on the restaurant management and employees. However, unfortunately, it does affect the way I feel about patronizing this establishment.  We have been to several Red Robins throughout California because our boys love it and this location has been the biggest disappointment. Each time we have come it has not been the best experience.  Tonight, however, was different. We had an amazing waitress that catered to our every need. My husband was impressed with the fact that she brought both of us ranch dressing on our plates for our fries. We didn't have to ask for it. The food was good, but I was so disappointed in the fries.

If I had to choose where my favorite fries were from, then with no hesitation Red Robin would be in my top 5 to choose from. They have bottomless garlic fries and I always end up hardly touching my burger because of that. When my family and I are trying to figure out dinner and we all crave burgers, this is definitely one of the spots that is picked. Love the burger options here as their is a burger for everyone. The atmosphere is nice and the workers are always great. The good thing is, even though Red Robin is always busy, it doesn't take long to get seated. I don't think I've ever had to wait longer than 15min to get seated. Amazingly, I don't think I've ever browsed their desserts as I'm a sucker for sweets.

Even with the free burger and half off appetizer it was still $14.00 I found that kind of odd. The drinks were $5 each.... I feel like that is a LOT for lemonade with 4 soggy strawberries thrown in. All of it was pretty gross. Its a chain restaurant that seems like it has given up on itself.  Red Robin- Don't brag about bottomless fries and then give me 4 cold old fries on my plate and make me wait 20 minutes for another batch of 5 cold stale old fries. Just don't do it.

Andrew L.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,6,5,3.0,1/15/2017,"This was the first time eating here... we hung out in the bar while we waited for a large table for our friends birthday. The bartender was awesome, and had great customer service. I was kinda disappointed as they couldn't make an old-fashion (not the bartenders fault), they didn't stock the bitters. We ordered the tower of onion rings, they came out quickly and were good. I would have preferred beer-batter instead of panko, but they didn't list beer batter as an option. My girlfriend and I split the royal robin burger which came with a fried egg and bacon. Overall the burger was average, they went a little heavy on the mayo/spread. The meat was average, a little passed medium (I had ordered medium rare), bacon was cooked perfectly and was very crispy. Also the egg was cooked just how we asked. However, the bun was horrible as it seemed like the cheap buns from a grocery store. It's good they didn't cook the burger medium rare, because with the buns they used it would have fallen apart. The only other complaint was the fries seemed old, as if they had been sitting in a bowl past 10 min waiting to be plated. Our server was Chrissy, and she did a wonderful job. Very attentive but not over the top... she was organized in splitting the checks ahead of time, and multitasked very well. This all added up to excellent customer service.

Lynna H.,"Bakersfield, CA",12,19,36,3.0,1/3/2016,"Came here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday a day early, mainly cause he wanted the bottomless steak fries. We went on New Year's Day at around 4, and with the two of us, the young woman told us it would be a 10-15 minute wait. We were seated in less than ten minutes. We looked at our menus for a good minute before our waitress (Kaitlyn H.) swung by and asked what we wanted to drink. To be honest, she didn't introduce her name to us, I had to figure out what her name was by looking at my reciept at the end of the visit. Anyway, we didn't have time to think about what we wanted to drink, so we basically said the first thing in our heads: a water and coke. She came back with them very quickly. A good 5 minutes later, she came back and took our orders. We got a California Chicken Sandwich and a Burnin' Love (chicken substitute). We also got the $7 Spinach Artichoke dip for an appetizer  The dip came out quick, but it was a small portion, despite being $7. The dip was good, but there was barely any chip, and most of them were either too oily or just raw tortilla. The rest of the food came in after we finished the appetizer. Boy, did I smell all the spiciness from the Burnin' Love! With my CA Chicken, I can barely see or taste any of the guac that was in there.  My boyfriend and I finished our steak fries in a quick moment, and we wanted more! Everytime we tried ti wave down our waitress (Kaitlyn), she wouldn't see it/ignore it or ask us for a refill on our drinks and then quickly scuttle away before we can say anything else. Whenever we would try say thank you when she gave us something or took something, she would walk away before hearing us say thank you or listen for anything else. After FOREVER, she came by and asked if we wanted more fries. Duh. She came back hella quick with our fries, but we were already full to enjoy our fries. She walked away before I can ask for a box. I pressed the ""call server"" button, but its like she never acknowledged it. It took about 10 minutes until another server passed by and asked what we needed, and by the time that server came back with the box, Kaitlyn dropped by to see what was up a little too late.  TL;DR: Food was good, server was meh, and I didn't get to enjoy as much steak fries as I had hoped.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bakersfield?start=20
Rick S.,"Bakersfield, CA",4,59,,2.0,8/14/2017,"As they are one of the few restaurants open past 9 PM, I go there a few times a month.  I usually get the teriyaki burger which I find pretty good. Very messy but a lot of flavor.  The steak fries are five star. The last couple of times I tried something different.  The fish and chips were not good at all. I'm not sure if it was cooking or quality of fish, but two of the pieces were so solid you couldn't flake the fish apart when tried to bite.  The next time I tried the chicken tortilla soup. Mediocre at best. Tasted more like a generic canned soup them something made fresh. More thick and gooey than a flavorful broth. My dining partner ordered his burger with a Boca Patty on both occasions. The first time it was still ice cold in the center. We sent it back and came out fresh and hot.  The next time it was warm but not hot, as we had a movie time to meet he dealt with it.  I do applaud them for having a vegetarian option and I'm sure they need to keep those frozen before cooking.  But a quick refresher to the cooks on grilling/microwave time would be good ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bakersfield?start=20
Alice C.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,5,3,1.0,1/5/2016,"Ok everyone, I'm going to share MY personal experience with Red Robin. If you chose to eat there, make sure you pray for your food. On 12/14/15 I took my grandson for his birthday to eat there along with my son and my niece. Me, my son and my grandson all had burgers, my niece had a chicken salad. Within 2 hours all of us who had burgers got sick to our stomaches with severe cramps and diarrhea. Not to mention I only ate 1/2 the burger, brought the other 1/2 home, that Nagi ate the next day (Tuesday) and he woke up with the next morning (Wednesday) with the same symptoms. The boys refused to go to the dr. My symptoms just worsened causing me to miss 2 1/2 days of work and a trip to urgent care.  I was just called from Sendas urgent Care and told my results came back positive for SALMONELLA (Food Contamination)!!

James D.,"Bakersfield, CA",21,108,,3.0,3/16/2016,"I like Red Robin - I really do.  All you can eat fries that are actually pretty legit, good chain-restaurant quality burgers, and ""mixologist"" crafted drinks? It's the quintessential mall eatery. Like, if Waiting (the film with Ryan Reynolds) was an actual documentary, it would be based on Red Robin. (I think the movie pulls from Applebee's/TGIF.) So I come in and the hostess sits me down at a table and points out this device on the table. It's not an iPad...it's a contraption with a touch screen. And she says I can order my drinks and food and appetizers and desert through it, so okay, sure. I ordered through it, and this guy brings out my food. I pay with my credit card on the contraption (kiosky thing?), and it asks if I want to give a 25% tip. But wait - who am I tipping?  The device or the hostess or the guy who brought me my food/drinks? The gal and guy were pretty nice but they didn't really do anything that warranted a tip. I mean, I understand the sociopolitical implications of tipping, and I do tip - usually generously (20% on average). And then there's the new state-mandated law that basically affects the way tips are shared (e.g., cooks/chefs don't get a portion of tips). I won't launch in to a diatribe, so back to my original question: Who I am tipping? I can't logically justify at 25% tip when 90% of my interaction was with a kiosk/contraption/wanna-be iPad and not an employee.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bakersfield?start=40

Jillian K.,"Bakersfield, CA",42,79,247,2.0,7/22/2016,"We went on 7/21/16 around 4:10. It was surprisingly busy. The hostess told us to be patient because there were only 2 servers. No problem. I understand because I used to be a server for 4 yrs. our server was a young Asian gal and quite frankly, she was rude. My husband and I look like a young Asian couple ourselves, but for some reason, when we get Asian servers, they treat us like we're second class citizens. She hurriedly took our order, barely managing a hi... As if we were inconveniencing her. And every time she would bring food to our table, she would set it down fast and not say a word. And then she'd walk away really fast...not asking if we needed anything. There was another older Caucasian couple behind us and she was very polite to them, constantly asking if they're doing ok. The time that she actually did come around to our table to ask if we were ok, she'd only look at my husband and ask him. That's one of my pet peeves when servers do that, whether it be a guy or a girl. When I served, I made sure to make eye contact with both and address the couple as a whole. Guess she didn't know I was the one paying and tipping. Because we've both been in the food industry, we tip very well and we are way more understanding than most people. Unfortunately, our server profiled us wrongly. The only good thing about the visit was that we got our food fast and it was hot. I'm so tired of getting crappy service in Bakersfield.

I have lived here for almost 2 years and had never gone because I loved the location in Sacramento I used to go to. It just felt like it wouldn't compare. I took a chance anyways. I walked in and the hostess was leaning on her stand and grinning at what I thought was me as part of a greeting, but apparently I was wrong. After standing there for a sec, she asked me how many I was waiting for and I said, ""Just me."" She then suggested I sit at the bar, which kind of ticked me off. Just because I'm a party of one doesn't mean I always want to sit at the bar!!!! I didn't really feel like dealing with her so I went and sat in the bar area in hopes of better service. Luckily, my hope became reality! I had this amazing server who was very quick on his feet, communicative, and his smile was contagious! I think his name was David. He was busy, but he would let me know he was on his way and since I was sitting alone, he seemed to check on me extra which I appreciate because service always seems slower (even when it's not) when you're alone. He got me everything I needed and was very kind. The food came out quickly and lived up to Red Robin standards, which is definitely chain food but still decently yummy. At my bill, he was a little slow to the draw as I had never used the tablet system and I was planning on paying in cash, so I waited for him to help me which took awhile. We had a little trouble with my rewards card but he was very helpful in figuring it out and kept a smile on, which kept my smile on.

Chris M.,"Bakersfield, CA",110,18,6,2.0,6/9/2015,"Honestly two stars is being kind, but the hostess was extremely polite so she gained the second star. We ordered our drinks along with our daughters dinner so she wouldn't go berserk, we then ordered our meals a few minutes. We ordered the grilled chick on a stick for our daughter, my wife ordered the bacon guacamole burger, and I ordered the tried and true Royal burger. My wife asked for her burger medium rare and I asked for the egg on my burger to be over medium. I also asked for the garlic fries (shame on you red robin. I'll touch on this in a bit) Our food arrived shortly after. So much for ordering our daughters food ahead of ours. My daughters chicken was not even luke warm, my wife's burger had almost no guacamole and the egg on my burger looked like it had been microwaved. And my ""garlic fries""....seriously you guys? How many corners are you going to cut now? The fries simply had garlic powder sprinkled on them. What happen to the old Red Robin? Year after year you guys cut more and more corners. How the hell were you ranked one of the best burgers? The quality of the meat has simply tanked over the years.  I waited several minutes for our server to pop back up. When I drew his attention to the egg on my burger he seemed to have no idea what the problem was. I expressed that I ordered the egg over medium and it looks like it has been sitting under the heat lamp all night and over cooked the egg. He asked if I would like another egg. I said sure that fine, knowing by the time the new egg came out the burger would be cold.  While waiting for the new egg I noticed almost all of his tables were having issues. The table directly behind us complained of mayonnaise on her burger after she requested no mayo. He was very quick to apologize and offer to make her a hole new burger. At that point my jaw just dropped. I'm sitting here waiting for an egg and she gets a new burger because of mayo(I get it, they can't just wipe the mayo off). Few more minutes goes by and a woman comes from the kitchen dragging her feet across the floor the entire way to our table and ask who ordered the side egg. This new egg was crispy to all hell and also almost over cooked, at least there was a little bit of a yolk left in this one.  Needless to say I hope this was the final fail so my wife stops asking for Red Robin. I was hoping she would have said Eureka burger but she was craving the good old guacamole bacon burger that Red Robin use to serve before they became Carl's Jr. Get it together you guys!

I'm from LA, so we thought having Red Robin for a late lunch while in Bakersfield wouldn't be much different from the ones we usually go to. At first glance, you can see nearly all the servers are very young (even the janitorial staff). Different from what I'm used to, but I didn't want that to affect my experience. It was until we had to flag them down that I noticed how irritable it was. They had an excuse for EVERYTHING. ""Oh, there's trash on this table. I'm sorry! Let me clean it before you sit. I can't believe no one did it beforehand."" ""No more ketchup? I just hate it when no one replaces it, don't you?"" Look, I don't care if everything wasn't 1OO% prepared, so I don't need you trying to strike a conversation about how others aren't working. You weren't prepared, fine. But apologize for yourself and stop placing the blame elsewhere. I guess the servers are so young that they're so fixated on getting a gold star on every single thing they do. Anyways, food was good. (Although, my server had tried to question me on my order. I KNOW what kind of bread I want, so stop trying to get me to choose another bread!) Skimpy on the fries really, but not really a complaint when they're bottomless. Servers are always chatting in the grilling area, talking about their friends, lives, and jobs.

They also brought the kids the usual menu with crayons, and also balloons. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating is because we made the mistake of using the electronic pay machine that they have at each table. We tried to split the bill evenly between three cards, which is an option, but not a user friendly one.  Long story short, no one in building could correct our double & incorrect charges that were already pending on our accounts, and we had to wait an extra 20 minutes while they unsuccessfully tried.

Down south we had better food service and quality. This location, however, we've had bad experiences. I would say it is expecting from these places. Tonight, like other nights, my burger was dry, sour because all you couls taste was the pickle with the relish. There was no balance. It was hard to even continue to eat it. Plus the waitress got my order wrong. They brought out appetizers too early, we asked and they confirmed they would come out with the main meal for my wife. However, they brought half of them right off the back. I definitely think paying $41 for mac-n-cheese, a burger, and 3 appetizers didn't hit the spot. Our waitress seemed snobby too, not just to us but to her other tables. I also was shocked to be given 30 minute wait times and yet lots of open tables and booths and it seemed like good coverage too. I've seen it more full with less staff.

I've been dining at Red Robin's in the bay area for years and years, but this one blew me away in terms of service and food.  First, we were greeted by a friendly hostess and despite a crowded waiting room (and restaurant), we were seated within 5 minutes, may be even 3.  We didn't wait long at all when our server acknowledged us. Her name was Isis and she even apologized for the wait. We were thinking ""What wait?""  She was spot on the whole time.  Attentive and friendly and not at all invasive.  I ordered some chicken pesto aioli sandwich with garlic parmasan fries. YUMMY. Chicken breast was cooked perfect, not  dry at all.  In fact, I polished my plate. My db ordered the turkey burger, he too polished his plate. Also, had no idea the endless basket of fries applied to the garlic parmesan ones!  When Isis gave us the choice, we were stumped because last we ate at the Saratoga Red Robin, they only gave us regular fries even though I ordered a plate that offered the garlic parmesan ones.   Glad we decided to eat there for our first meal in Bakersfield.  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bakersfield?start=140

Thus is when the disappoint started it took the waitress at least if not more five minutes to come to our table. She did not apologize for the wait and she didn't greet us with her name. She proceeded to ask if we looked over the menu and what would we like. Irritated I asked for water and peach tea as my bf asked for lemonade. We also placed an appetizer order. She dropped off our drinks and didn't return for another ten to 15 minutes to get our entree order. After waiting for what seemed like forever our food arrived. The food was just OK nothing special ( we got the red royal robin). I do have to say the server did improve on refilling our drinks on a timely manner. We did not find out the servers name until the bill came.. Natalie! My bf is a manager at a restaurant and I am a server. When we go out we except great service because that is what we provide not to mention we are a paying customer service should be already good. If red robin wants to improve the managers nd servers shouldn't hide behind the fact it was a lunch rush. Even if the restaurant is full/busy the customers deserve good service.

It's a shame, since in the past I had many good dinning experiences here, but something has changed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bakersfield?start=120
Anici S.,"Bakersfield, CA",48,62,1,4.0,8/24/2014,"This is an updated review of Red Robin. First let me start with the management. They are on the ball people! I was contacted less than 24 hours after my last review on yelp. The first initial contact was from out of town perhaps corporate and was through a message on Yelp. My second contact was a personal phone call from a local manager. I was given a heartfelt apology and a gift card to comeback and try them again.  I returned gift card in tow and am happy to say that I was much more satisfied with the quality ( temperature) of my food. My waitress was very nice and helped me sign up for the rewards program they offer ( very cool) which gave me a free hamburger of my choice during my birthday month! My only major complaint is that every visit it's seems to be a chore to get refills on drinks or sides of sauces once I receive my meal. Maybe understaffed? I have also noticed many times other people (staff, runners, managers) bringing food to tables.  All in all I love Red Robin. I can eat bottomless fries, feed my picky kids and people watch all the crazies in the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bakersfield?start=120
Alena S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",17,11,1,2.0,4/23/2014,"Food was great! Compliments to the cook! But the hosting and waiting stuff for horrible. First as I walked into the restaurant I stood patiently waiting for the hostess to acknowledge me. Her name was Amber. After about a minute or so I asked her if I could be seated. She looked as if I interrupted her from a deep thought and said ""You can sit anywhere you like."", and smiled. So I did seat myself strangely at a booth near the end. A male waiter presented himself and asked the basics. Told me his name was Matt and took my order and left. As I looked around there were groups of team members talking by the kitchen entrance. They were laughing and joking around, then I noticed my waiter Matt was apart of the group. After 6 or so minutes he finally brought my beverage.  Those were my only concerns. Staffing needs to be rethought.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bakersfield?start=120

Traci C.,"Frazier Park, CA",3,2,,5.0,2/28/2015,"Will Go Back!!!!  Husband and I went for dinner on a Monday night. Was busy but got table right away. Our waiter was super friendly and attentive filling up drinks and checking on us. I ordered some sort of whisky BBQ burger with crispy onions on it. Husband ordered fish and chips.  While waiting for order I was looking at the tablet on table and saw they have bottomless root beer floats! Husband said next time he will get one instead of the strawberry lemonade with real strawberries in it. (That means there is a next time!)  Our order came quickly even though the place was busy. My burger was so big I had to cut it first and after first half was done I could only eat part of the inside with a fork ( ate all the crispy onions they were yummy!) I usually don't care for fish, but the fish and chips my husband ordered looked so good, I might just order it next time. Not only were they nice and golden, they looked tender and flaky! And they were big pieces.    The bottomless steak fries that came with both our dinners were OK. They could have been a tad hotter but really not complaining. Waiter came by and asked if we wanted more. But I was full from that burger.   We didn't order dessert, but they show a brownie sticks covered in chocolate and served with berry dipping sauce on the tablet at the table. If I wasn't already full I'd have gotten it to share with hubby as it looked good. I don't mind the location being at the mall. It just means easier access to shopping! Which is what we did after.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bakersfield?start=120
Shawn F.,"Union City, CA",84,26,,5.0,11/14/2014,My mother recently left her wallet behind at this location. She in a panic reached out to the store and found out that the manager had her wallet locked up in the safe. Having driven 4 hrs up the road to San Jose they were not anywhere close to return to pick up the wallet. My parents offered to pay for the shipping but the manager said that it would taken care of. Hats off to this location for putting my parents minds at ease!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bakersfield?start=120
Veronica L.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,4,,1.0,11/13/2014,"Why do I keep coming coming back here??  Every time I come the service is horrible, my waiter skipped my table and asked the table in front of us and the two beside us, if they were doing fine. I didn't know we were painted on the wall. Also my drinks didn't get here until my food did, they were watered down, and my appetizer never showed up. If the food wasn't so good I would have stopped coming here a long time ago, definitely going to find a new place  for a good burger!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bakersfield?start=120
Lucas R.,"Seattle, WA",170,479,81,4.0,8/7/2012,"We are always pleasantly surprised when we visit. We dont expect much when dining at a mall, but service is great, food is good, and prices are reasonable. And this one has improved by enclosing the walls so mall traffic isnt so distracting.  Endless fries and cheesey mac, a new menu, improved appetizers, homemade dipping sauces, options for everyone, and a new Mint Brownie Shake.

Jillian G.,"Bakersfield, CA",2,16,,5.0,7/13/2015,"The five stars is for our bartender Kim! It was her first day back after maternity leave and she was the bomb! Poor girl had an amazing attitude, even after only a couple hours sleep with a newborn! She was attentive,  personable and it was obvious that the regulars were glad she was back too! I don't usually frequent the mall, but had a few hours to kill while my phone was at the Apple Store.

Lucylyn G.,"Lemoore, CA",54,126,42,2.0,8/7/2012,"I went to a RR in Dallas for the first time in ages. There I had the most amazing BBQ chicken wrap. It tasted so good that while we were driving home from LA and got hungry I decided that we just had to stop by and get another. It was that good.  I called in the order while we were a few miles out and when we got there just as it was finished. The girls at the counter we very nice and helpful. When we got back into the car and I started tearing down I was really very sad. It still tasted the same but didn't at the same time. The big difference was that the veggies in this wrap were somehow soggy, where as the last time I had it they were fresh and crunchy. I was also missing the coleslaw that it came with. Something I really didn't want to find out as we were driving home which was nearly 2 hours away. I didn't want to have to turn around for my order to be right, so I dealt with it. It was so soggy I only ate half.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bakersfield?start=120
