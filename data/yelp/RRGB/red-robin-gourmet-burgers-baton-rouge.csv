Marilyn A.,"Gonzales, LA",2,3,,5.0,7/19/2017,"To start this off I want to say .... not only is this the cutest place every but its the best ! So the service was great, we were immediately seated and they took our drink orders. I decided on the Madlove burger.  While our food was coming out our wonderful waiter bought us some fries and dipping sauces for the ""long"" wait ... sis WHAT WAIT??? They made sure we were very well attended. After, our food came out & LET ME JUST SAY that was love at first sight. The burger was delicious, one of the best I had every tried. The fries ??? AMAZING.  As a burger lover I can say this is one of my new faves.... for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baton-rouge
A S.,"Baton Rouge, LA",20,46,320,5.0,6/25/2017,Got off to a rough start with a longer than expected wait.  Server was attentive and really nice.  Food was good. Really enjoyed the pretzel bites with the beer cheese dip.  My burger and onion rings were perfect and so was the fiancé'Chili Chili burger and garlic herb fries.  Topped it all off with delicious Salted Caramel milkshakes.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baton-rouge
Bobby G.,"Baton Rouge, LA",280,78,71,3.0,9/19/2017,"Well it looks inviting from the outside but there was no one to welcome me on the inside. After standing at the entrance for 5 minutes waiting to be seated I decided to just sit at the bar. The bartender was very pleasant with lots of knowledge about the menu and drink specials . The food was mediocre, not what I'd call gourmet, yet still appetizing . The milkshakes and root beer floats are spot on and the bottomless steak fries is a plus for a person on a budget. I recommend Red Robin for families or a quick bite with friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baton-rouge
Michael M.,"Denham Springs, LA",13,73,61,5.0,7/4/2017,"A five star performance. The burgers were hot, juicy, and delicious. This was the best experience we've ever had at any burger store including this store.  It wasn't just the food and the atmosphere this time.  It was actually the service that beat all.  Our waiter, Aaron(not sure of spelling), was the most attentive waiter I have ever witnessed. He never had anybody searching for him because he checked every table each time he came back and forth.  This guy is a real gem in a business that is symbiotic with transient and sometimes subpar labor. If I had a restaurant I would want to hire people like Aaron.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baton-rouge
Jenni C.,"Baton Rouge, LA",187,160,371,1.0,11/11/2016,"Our waitress was great, very friendly. The food took awhile to arrive. And when it did I was immediately disgusted. I ordered the pub mac and cheese with bacon, endless salad. I'm not sure what I was served but it was definitely not what was described on the menu. I promptly sent it back and settled for a burger. The salad wasn't anything great either. Brown, wilty lettuce, not very appetizing but I was starving so I ate it. There needs to be an improvement on the quality coming out of the kitchen. While they took off the charge for the Mac and cheese, no other apologies were made. The fact my bf was completely done with his dinner by the time I got mine? Ugh! Very dissatisfied.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baton-rouge

Michelle S.,"Baton Rouge, LA",151,139,507,3.0,6/3/2016,"Always pass by it when I'm at the mall and finally in the mood for a burger today so I went in for a quick bite during lunch time.  Ordered me a Banzai burger that comes with unlimited fries/steamed broccoli/salad. I'm a sucker for fries so I picked fries- they have their own seasoning salt you can add which is tasty!  The Banzai burger is basically a burger with grilled pineapples on it, I liked the pineapples but thought the hamburger meat is too salty and the buns did not hold up well, it became soggy within seconds! Overall, it tasted alright but not great. I also got a mint brownie milk shake which was good, nothing too special about it. Good came out fast and service was decent.

Marielle S.,"New Orleans, LA",182,1983,4519,5.0,9/22/2016,"I don't if it's because I was super hungry when I ate here, but I loved this place. My boyfriend and I grabbed some lunch here before the LSU game. I won't lie, I was pretty excited- after seeing Red Robin commercials for years, I was ready to FINALLY see what all the fuss was about. They had a special burger which was a two patty burger with mac and cheese in the middle. It was like a cheeseburger with a twist! Of course, it came with their steak fries, so I was all about it. This burger was so good! The mac and cheese was perfect with the burger and I loved that it was a good size but not HUGE. The fries were perfectly cooked and tasty. I also I had a beer that came in a nice big mug that stayed cold. I think it's neat that they have an iPad type thing at every table, so that you can pay when you are ready- that's really convenient. Service was great and the atmosphere was laid back and fun. I will definitely be back when I am in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baton-rouge

It was a massive burger; sauces perfectly paired and succulent chicken. And did I mention its a veggie-friendly place where you can subsitiute with their custon veggie patties?!?!

The location is great, the interior is going for a retro cool kinda vibe...seating is comfortable and the overall effect is relaxing... Walked in at 4:30 on a Thursday afternoon and other than a couple already seated me and the son were the only people in the place...a group of 6-7 came in after us and were served before us even though our order went in first...hmm  Went with the Big Tavern burger which is listed under the Tavern burger which is a double meat burger...no explanation about the Big Tavern so pardon me all to hell if you give me the impression the Big Tavern is also double meat but IT'S NOT... The Big Tavern is a ""big"" single patty that ain't that big...the Tavern is smaller patties in a double configuration...Honestly I'd hate to see the ""small"" patties after experiencing the ""big"" patty... Ordered the Garlic Herb fries which were a laugh just bland steak fries with some chopped green and cold garlic parmesan cheese thrown on top...ridiculous The son went with the Royal Red Robin...their take on a burger with a fried egg...the egg was way undercooked...hell looked like it had barely set...However the son was complimentary of the crisp bacon...Want a burger with a fried egg try Walk On's...just saying Oh yeah, I guess Gourmet Burgers don't come with onions and pickles...have to specifically ask...what kinda burger joint makes you request pickle and onion?

Christine W.,"Baton Rouge, LA",203,159,1293,4.0,10/28/2015,"I happen to really like Red Robin.  Went to my first one in Denver in 1989 and I've been going back ever since.  I've been to at least a dozen over the years.   It is a chain, but the consistency is very good across the franchisees.  I went tonight to the one in BR for the first time to get my free birthday burger and it did not disappoint me.  I started with a sangria and ordered my favorite burger the Blue Ribbon with garlic herb fries.  Burger was cooked perfectly... Hot and juicy. The fries were hot and crisp.  Although I do like the garlic Herb fries, I do miss the old garlic parmesan version that came with chunks of garlic and loads of parmesan cheese.  The new version is garlic salt with sparsely and some parmesan thrown in.  Not the franchisees fault for the corporate wide change. I enjoyed my free burger and fries. I really liked the new menu pad at the table that comes loaded with games.  For $1.99 you can play until you cash out.  It kept me occupied for the entire meal.. Good thing I was dining alone.  Was very happy with the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baton-rouge

We weren't greeted, just was asked how many people needed to be seated, (it was the manager). After we were seated the manager walked away and started fussing at a guy, that guy would be our server.

Daniel M.,"Baton Rouge, LA",177,303,69,4.0,6/16/2016,"Entering the Red Robin on a rainy Monday afternoon I noticed only a sprinkling of clientele to match the weather outside. I made my way to the bar and took a seat. The bar area was well appointed with several TVs showing sporting events. The bar top, while obviously not meticulously cleaned, was not necessarily dirty, just not sparkling. I take this into account and decide it isn't an imperfection I would let dissuade me from pursuing this new to Baton Rouge venture known as Red Robin. A comely young bartender met me with a smile, handed me a menu and asked for my drink preference. I order a Dr Pepper and begin to peruse the menu. My eyes widen at the sight of juicy bovine deliciousness exploding off the page in high definition. I wondered what the differences were as they all appeared to have similar toppings choices, but then I noticed the pricing is all over the place. The young lady returns with my Dr. Pepper. ""I've never been here before, is there anything special I should know about?"" I ask. ""Um. I don't think so"" she responds in a tone that isn't dismissive, but definitely not as helpful as I was hoping. I decide that she's not in the mood for banter so I politely order a regular bacon cheeseburger.  The order is placed and I settle into my phone to read the news, occasionally glancing up to check out an interview with no sound on ESPN. After a short bit of time my food arrived. The aroma was heavenly and a slight hint of steam was rising from the glistening mass of ground tenderness before me. Large, steak cut fries accompanied the burger and I dove into them immediately as I am wont to do. This habit serves purpose twofold: my passion for French fries burns hotter than the fire stolen by Prometheus to allow man to create such delicacies AND to ascertain if they're hot and fresh. These fries were not piping hot, but not old. I turn my attention to the meat sandwich. The first bite was delightful. I could taste salt and pepper and meaty flavors, coupled with melty cheese and chewy bacon. The lettuce, tomato and onion complimented the hearty umami of the proteins and cheese in a way that added a crunch and a tang of sweetness to what was already an almost sensual exchange between taste buds and sustenance. I had to tell myself to slow down. If I rushed this experience I would soon regret not savoring each and every bite. I continued patiently. Not wanting the hot juices to be wasted on my chin, I bit carefully and slowly masticated each with as much care and love as the one before it.   My fries are gone now and the bartender asks if I'd like more. ""You can do that?"" I said incredulously. This was mostly for show because I had specifically given her the opportunity to explain when I told her I was a first time customer. She said yes, not catching my attempt to remind her of our earlier exchange. I surrendered my point, agreed to more, and went back to the main attraction in this gastronomic endeavor. Within a minute I was welcomed by a basket of fresh fries. Long, thick and golden. The bouquet of potato, salt and oil attacked my senses. Suddenly, I'm at a loss. This beautiful, meaty relationship I've been having for the last 5 minutes is suddenly thrown into question by a newly arrived jezebel named Hot Fries. I charge forward into the fries with reckless abandon. Not caring about the heat from the freshly prepared spuds, I feverishly cram them in my mouth. It burns the roof, lips are scorched but the pain only makes the salty goodness that much better. The fries are gone now as I lick the salt and oil from my fingers then shamefully use my napkin as I am brought back to earth from the ethereal plane to which I was whisked in the presence of freshly cooked carbohydrates.   Time to finish this burger. There are only two bites left, and after the massacre I just imparted on the fries, I took a minute to digest and clear my palate. The penultimate bite was as delicious as all those before it but the last bite was the best. The last piece of bun was permeated and stained with the grease and oil that was squeezed into it from each bite I'd taken previously.  It did not disappoint. The firm but juicy meat, still warm cheese and a soaked bun reminiscent of French toast but soaked with salty brine instead of maple syrup met my mouth in a crescendo of piquancy and sadness, as I knew the experience was now over.  I asked my server for the check and she pointed to the computer tablet mounted on the bar top. When she noticed my puzzled look she came over and flipped the screen and brought up my check. ""Oh, I see"" I exclaimed, again trying to remind her I was a first timer. Again, lost. I will be back but 4 Stars due to the uncleanliness of the bar top, the subpar first round of fries and the general nonchalance of the server. I do not expect or necessarily desire to be waited on hand and foot but I gave her opportunities to wow a new and hopefully returning customer and she choose the route of indifference.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baton-rouge

Brian R.,"Baton Rouge, LA",22,28,1,1.0,3/15/2015,"We went to Red Robin tonight for the first time.  The reviews were mixed but we decided you couldn't really go wrong with a burger.  WRONG! First, the burger was OK.  It was cold but that was probably because it sat there forever before our server ran it to us.  Speaking of service, this place has THE WORST SERVICE!!! We had to wait well over 30 minutes for our food to arrive when it clearly had been ready for a while.  She had to be flagged down for a refill during that wait and we had to ask her for it twice.  The poor people next to us didn't even get their drinks for a good 15 minutes.   Once our food came out we ate and quickly needed more fries.  They give you 10 fries if you are lucky.  We asked the server and waited...and waited.  She comes back and asks if we are together or separate.  I answer her but remind her about the fries.  She says they are coming and brings us the check.  Then she proceeds to completely clean our table.  Ummm, we aren't finished, we are waiting on more food.  We wait some more and I finally hand her my credit card.  She runs it and returns it and we tell her to not worry about the fries.  She has absolutely no response, just turns around and walks away. The manager was walking by and we got his attention and told him this was the worst service we have ever had.  He said he ""wished he had known.""  Well how about you walk around and ask your tables how their meal is going and if they need anything.  You would have known.  He has nothing to say besides that and even blamed the kitchen when we made it very clear the problem was our server. We will NEVER come back here.  Food could be OK if it was ran on time.  Service could not be worse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baton-rouge?start=40
Michelle J.,"Baton Rouge, LA",39,39,249,1.0,1/9/2015,"WHERE. DO. I. BEGIN??? Worst dining experience i've had in a very long time but i'll start with a positive. Well..THE positive. When we got there the place was packed. We were told it'd be a 20-25 minute wait for 2 which I didn't mind because it was pretty early in the day and I had to see what all the hype was about. The wait was only about 15 minutes maybe a little less. I now think that was because those in front of us turned down our table. It was THE worst seat in the house. Positioned right in front of the kitchen next to a small ledge where employees perched to gossip and complain right over us. Hated it! After about 5 minutes, we were greeted and drink orders were placed. We should have double fisted because getting a refill was almost impossible. For an app we ordered the short stack of onion rings which were really good with the ranch dip. After finishing and waiting for our entree orders to be taken another order of onion rings is brought to the table and once the server realized we've not only received but eaten some she leaves in a huff. Apparently there has been some sort of mix-up in the kitchen. Again I don't care to be involved. Finally orders are placed for burgers and the wait begins for 2 bbq burgers one topped with a fried egg and garlic fries. As we wait I could only think of the game Diner Dash. One by one customers at different tables blew their steam for a slew of things and I feared i'd be next. The manager popped in and out of the kitchen completely oblivious to everything going on around him...not the stretched eyes..not the scrunched foreheads.  When the burgers finally came we still had to wait for another 5+ minutes to eat them bc our server hadn't brought out any utensils or napkins. They're way to huge not to cut into. Once tasted, we agreed that they were just ok and going to Red Robin can be ticked off of life's to-do list never to be revisited.  Long story short...the witty commercials have brought the customers but sub par customer service and average food won't keep them. They need some help from Restaurant Impossible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baton-rouge?start=40

Steve C.,"Sugar Land, TX",33,6,20,3.0,1/14/2015,"Red Robins always remind me of the saying, ""Self-glorification is not an endorsement."" They tout they make gourmet burgers but they don't.  I became familiar with Red Robin in the late 70s in Northern California. And to this day, they prepare a good burger but not a gourmet burger. Yes, they offer different items to present burgers with fancy names. However, they do not offer burgers with exceptional flavor, which would make them gourmet burgers.  This location is no exception. It has the same old burgers presented with the same old standard congenial service worthy of three-star ratings.  And for Baton Rouge, Red Robin needs to introduce burgers with a local flair, like a Tiger Burger, and a Gator Burger, and a Red Robin Crawfish Po' Boy, with some Bottomless Cajun Fries.

It was delivered by someone else who seemed annoyed that I asked for a side of mayo. It took a few minutes but he finally brought it. The waitress never checked on us to see if we needed drink refills or more of the bottomless fries they advertise. I also wanted dessert but she never came. We used the automated checkout they have at the table and had to try several times because it wanted me to tip 20% and the tip I choose to leave was significantly less. I will tip 20% or better when the service justifies it, this service did not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baton-rouge?start=40
Haley D.,"Jena, LA",12,2,,1.0,10/18/2015,Horrific dining experience. The restaurant was moderately full. We waiting at least 15 minutes for a waiter to come take our drink order and at least 15 more to take our order.  We then wait approximately 50 minutes to get our food. We are from out of town and on and tight schedule. We expressed this to the waitress after 50 minutes or so and she was quite rude.  Our food finally comes out about 10 minutes later. Two of the orders were completely wrong. The other two were cold when they received them.  We ended up having them take the two incorrect orders off and just leaving. They took care of the ticket but we were sad to have such a terrible experience. We will NOT be returning!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baton-rouge?start=40

I noticed the floor was sticky in the waiting area; my shoes were sticking as I waited for my table.   We were led to a table after a short wait. The wait time of 5-10 minutes was accurate.  We were told our waitress would be with us shortly.  We sat at the table for another ten minutes and never had anyone even acknowledge us.  Several wait staff passed by.  There were many open tables around us.  No one appeared over worked.  We decided after watching another wait person walk by without even eye contact to leave and had a wonderful experience with the service at the nearby pizza place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baton-rouge?start=60

Upon entering there were lots of people waiting for a table and tons of tables empty so I'm not sure what the hold up was but we waited about 25 minutes which wasn't bad for a Friday evening. Our waitress was Robin who at first wasn't that friendly and seemed annoyed with us but towards the end lightened up and actually joked and smiled with us. Once we ordered it didn't take too long for the food to come out.  The food was mediocre and nothing really wowed us. I had the mini wedge salad and a bowl of French onion soup. The salad was ok and the soup I actually had to send it back which is probably the second time in my life I ever sent anything back. It was super salty and just inedible. The pretzel bits were great. The boneless buffalo wings were ok and the chips they were on top of were great.  Everyone at our table thought everything was ok and an ok experience.

First of all, like other reviewers have mentioned, a manager had to take our drink orders because our server wasn't yet available. We both ordered milkshakes that were actually pretty good. We also ordered the queso as an app. Our app was brought without any napkins or flatware which annoyed me a bit but I just blew that off. When it came time to order, our server asked if we wanted our burgers with some pink or no pink which I took to mean medium well or well done. I asked for the first option. Imagine my surprise when I bit into my burger only to taste almost completely raw beef. I felt sick to my stomach and asked my husband to please get a manager. The manager came over and apologized offering to remake the burger but we just asked for the ticket instead. I couldn't imagine eating anything else cooked at a place that would actually serve a raw burger. The manager was nice enough to take both of our burgers off the ticket.

Jonathan S.,"Houston, TX",215,152,68,1.0,8/5/2015,"Bummmmed! Really thought it was going to be great. Everything other than the greeter, ambiance and decor was terrible. The greeter was extremely nice and proved to be very helpful throughout the dinner. Courtney our waitress was not very helpful. The menu is overwhelming with a ridiculous number of items, and Courtney couldn't help us figure out what we wanted at all. Took 25 minutes to get our food, and once we did we still didn't have silverware or napkins. Food was bland and just a big let down. My girlfriend added salt to her burger and she said it made all the difference. I asked the greeter for one of all the different dipping sauces and attempted to flavor up my food as  I tried the different sauces. That was fun and interesting. Burgers, sweet potato fries, and garlic fries all were less than impressive. Even with them being bottomless they were pointless. Didn't even want to try the shakes as we were so let down. We got our check before we got our to go box, and Courtney apparently didn't want to give us one. She even gave us a small little box when it was obvious we needed one of their bigger boxes. I didn't feel like waiting another fifteen minutes for a box so I walked back to get one. When I asked Courtney for a bigger box she said they didn't carry any, and then I told her I saw the other table get one so  I know they have one. The greeter over heard the conversation and called Courtney out on the box situation. The greeter got one for me. In addition we were charged per coke on our bill! I've been to some of the fanciest restaurants in town, and it is extremely rare that this ever happens. Especially not at a Red Robin. Either Red Robin is hurting for profits, or now that I'm thinking about it Courtney inflated the bill for a bigger tip. That didn't work in her favor to say the least. Just a horrible experience all around. Not worth it one bit for a $15 burger. It sucks because I was really excited to go there.

Robert R.,"Baton Rouge, LA",26,168,11,3.0,2/22/2016,"Had to go to the mall with a couple of friends tonight and after finishing up we decided to go to Red Robin. They had been before but this was my first time ever eating at one. Upon walking in, it took about 2 minutes of waiting before a host appeared which I thought was rather odd, especially since on a Monday night the place was nearly empty - maybe 4 or 5 other tables. After leading us to a dining area, there were a large number of tables all left unbussed. The host cleaned off a table and seated us, and our server was with us shortly. Their beer selection is honestly pretty pathetic. I had a blue moon while looking over the slightly confusing, book-like menu. Eventually I decided to split the Ghost Pepper cheese fries with a friend, and ordered the chili chili cheeseburger for my entree. After noticing that the bottomless fries could be substituted for bottomless steamed broccoli, I was quite enthusiastic. You have no fucking idea how much I love steamed broccoli. I also ordered a TNT to enjoy with my meal, which is basically their version of a long island but their drink menu made it sound really good, claiming that it is made with top shelf liquors. They definitely went heavy on the Beefeater gin, which I found quite pleasing. Overall I would highly recommend this drink and I'm not usually a long island drinker. The ghost pepper cheese fries were commendable; the ghost pepper sauce itself had a good flavor. A bit heavy on tomato sauce and not quite spicy enough for something calling itself ghost pepper sauce but the flavor was good regardless. The fries had what appeared to be a puddle of liquid cheese on them but upon closer inspection the cheese was more solid than liquid. It was quite strange but enjoyable nonetheless. The only thing I didn't like about them were the ""fried jalapeno coins"", which had so little jalapeno in them that they were basically fried balls of dough tasting like old grease. The burger itself was the most disappointing part of the meal, which is sad because that's what they're supposed to be known for. The actual patty was a completely flavorless pre-formed patty that basically looked like it came from mcdonald's. The bun was kind of stale. The chili was acceptable, but lackluster overall. The cheese on top had no attempt at being melted and the chopped onions were chopped so thick that I can still taste them. After a heavy dousing with mustard the burger became palatable, but still nothing to write home about. The steamed broccoli was good, but comes in probably the smallest bowl ever. I wound up eating 4 bowls of broccoli but the server would take a good 10 minutes between bringing your miniature bowl so it really wasn't that worth it. The last bowl was strange in that the stems were overcooked and mushy while the florets remained crunchy. They have a house seasoning in shaker bottles on the table that actually compliments the broccoli very well. The service was acceptable otherwise, and considering how much I ate and drank I don't feel that the $32 before tip was a bad price, though I do feel that they really need to work on improving their burger patties if they are going to tout themselves as a gourmet burger restaurant. I can make a better burger any time, any where. I'm quite confident I could make a better burger even after downing 20 of their quite potent TNT drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baton-rouge?start=60

Travis S.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,4,,1.0,2/6/2016,"Went on a busy Friday night. Lukewarm burgers, hot fries, dirty floors, overall a sad experience. I will not be returning. Skip Red Robin and head next door to BJs for a way better atmosphere and food for the same price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baton-rouge?start=20
Ashley K.,"Baton Rouge, LA",120,149,176,3.0,1/12/2015,"Went around lunch time had to wait around 25 minutes. The great thing is that they text you a link to see what your wait in line is, very helpful. Great service and nice atmosphere.

Morgan E.,"Jacksonville, FL",122,85,190,2.0,10/15/2015,"My husband and I went to red robin so I could get my free birthday burger. Our server was a very pleasant lady but I wouldn't call her very professional. My fries were old and cold and when I told her she replied with, ""Yah, probably."" She then stared at me for a few seconds until I had to ask for new ones. It was a bit awkward.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baton-rouge?start=20
Rebecca W.,"Baton Rouge, LA",1970,931,7784,3.0,10/28/2015,"Wow, so Red Robin has come a long way from when I used to dine at one as a child. It's now become very trendy and have now added some pretty crafty craft burgers to their menu. This restaurant is huge and is a new addition ""The Boulevard"" (outdoor) section of the Mall of Louisiana adjacent to BJ's Brewhouse. I see why people flock here; it's a chain... why else? Chains of course are consistent and pretty much taste the same across the board. So, yes, it's comfortable! Our experience here was at the very end of our day after a fun-filled day of outdoor activities, so we were tired and hungry. Even though it was late and the server probably had a long day dealing with customers, I was happy to still see sparks of enthusiasm coming from her. She checked on us enough times to see how we were doing and was patient with us as we were indecisive on what to order. Their menu was extensive with burgers galore. If you don't plan on having a burger, don't come here because that is really what they are known for. I ordered my burger without a patty, which I do quite often and it was fairly decent - cooked the way I wanted it, but nothing really popped out at me. At that time I was just excited to eat anything because I was starving! This restaurant is open pretty late, so if you are looking for a late night bite, they will be available to serve you. I really did appreciate being promptly seated and wonderful customer service. So thank you Red Robin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baton-rouge?start=20
David T.,"Denham Springs, LA",11,126,156,4.0,12/16/2014,"Started off with chips, guacamole and Salsa. The guacamole dip was a little chunky, which I like, as was the salsa. So we started off on a good note. Daughter and I halved a Chilli Chilli burger and a Banzai Burger. Wife had a bacon cheeseburger. The Chilli was a little sneaky on the kick but it really good and the Banzai is basically like a Hawaiian burger, with the teriyaki and pineapple slices on it. All in all, everything was pretty awesome.  Also, if you like freebies, and who doesn't, they have a card with instructions on how to sign up for their emails and you can get a free malt to boot. Have it a go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baton-rouge?start=20
Barbara M.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,1.0,9/5/2016,"So disappointed with our $13 hamburger. It was so dry, and not much to it for the price. I won't be going back. The service wasn't great either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baton-rouge?start=20
Carrie B.,"Spring, TX",6,25,,2.0,12/31/2015,"We ate dinner at Red Robin last night, for the first and maybe the last time. The decor was cool, the menu was extensive, and the drink options were different. However, the service was awful. From the time we ordered until when we got our food, 35 minutes passed. We had to ask our server to check our order for us, and I'm convinced she forgot to place the order. After she checked on our order, it was another 15 mins until we received our food. We then had to ask for silverware and napkins before we could eat, as my husband had ordered a really messy burger. His Royal burger and my plan cheeseburger were just fine. We liked the bottomless fries option, although we didn't ask for more. We liked the option to pay via an iPad at the table, which was great considering we only saw our server once more. I really wanted to like this place, but the service aspect really turned me off. Maybe we'll give it another shot. We were there at dinner time, so maybe our experience was an anomaly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baton-rouge?start=20
Shannon T.,"Baton Rouge, LA",4,12,14,3.0,11/13/2015,"I've been here twice and both times I really enjoyed the bottomless fries!!! I am not really a burger person so I opted for the grilled chicken breast  the first time. You can tell the chicken was frozen and not fresh and it wasn't cooked all the way through. I enjoyed the mini donuts for dessert though..yum yum. Ok so round 2!! I opted for the grilled chicken salad this time and it was ok..nothing to really brag about. Again, I loved the bottomless fries!!! Took a bite of my sister's burger and it was good!!! Soooo I guess the burgers and fries are pretty good but if you are not a burger person then you may be up a creek!!! Overall, nice atmosphere and the service was good!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baton-rouge?start=20
Brant L.,"New Orleans, LA",529,12,14,2.0,3/10/2016,Dined in on a rather slow Thursday at 630pm. Took a seat in the bar area which was empty. Greet pretty fast with a menu and asked for drink order. Then a couple more people came in. The manager on duty and bartender were joking around behind the bar and then the manger was joking and cutting up with the waitstaff on the other side of the bar after that. Ordered a chips and salsa app while figuring out my burger order. 5 mins later I ordered my burger. Burger came out pretty fast so fast that I didn't get my app yet. Then after my meal was dropped no one was around for 5 mins and couldn't find any ketchup anywhere. All and all it was really bad service esp on a slow night. Not sure if I would come back. I have been to other red robins and had amazing service.  Not sure what is missing with this one.. Leadership or certain standards.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baton-rouge?start=20

Trevor R.,"Baton Rouge, LA",268,56,2,1.0,5/14/2015,"Bad food.  Our waitress was nice but poor processes made everything take soooo long. I ordered an Irish coffee shake (which was great), boneless breaded wings and a burger.  After eating 3-4 wings I realized the odd taste (I eat fast)...the last wing I ate was seared rather than cooked. I told the waitress who grabbed the manager. He came by and agreed the chicken wasn't cooked and asked what we wanted. We just asked to get the tab and never saw him again.  We were there for an hour +, paid $16 for drinks, and went next door to Grimaldi's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baton-rouge?start=20
Aaron W.,"Port Allen, LA",83,44,113,3.0,3/16/2015,"Red Robin ... yum?? I went for the first time last night and knew I had to get one of their burgers they are so famous for.  Now, I won't say I'm an expert burgologist or anything, but I'm somewhat a connoisseur of burgers and all things beef.  And I'll simply day this ... I was underwhelmed by my meal.  Sure, the bottomless fries/sweet potato fries/broccoli will keep you coming, but if it were based on JUST the burger, there are plenty of better options in BR. When I eat an establishment's burger for the first time, there are a couple of tests I must perform to rate the flavor. The first, and most important, is tasting the beef alone. To get the full flavor profile of the patty itself.  Red Robin's patty was extremely bland. So I didn't even perform the other parts of the test. Just wasn't worth it.  I will say, however, they have a lot of interesting flavors that I would love to try. And lots of sauces to dip your fries in other than your simple ketchup.  Overall, the burger isn't amazing, but the different styles, buns and flavors, along with the bottomless fries, is enough to intrigue me enough to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baton-rouge?start=20
