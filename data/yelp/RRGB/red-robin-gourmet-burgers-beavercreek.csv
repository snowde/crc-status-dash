Sean T.,"Dayton, OH",0,16,3,4.0,9/4/2017,"Definitely in a great location.  I had the Smoked Pepper Burger, everything about it was good except for the bacon, it was EXTREMELY stringy and tasted odd.  The waitress was great for the first part, but once our food came out, she never checked up on us, no refills or anything.  Only saw her one other time to ask for the check. Considering she only had two tables it was a bit odd that she was so hard to find.  Still have 4 stars though because she was good when she was there and the burger was overall, very good, besides the bacon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-beavercreek
Christopher K.,"Springboro, OH",16,32,,4.0,12/29/2017,"I don't come here often but when I do the service is always fantastic.  Burgers are the speciality and there are plenty to choose from to satisfy any appetite.  During a recent lunch visit, I had the guacamole burger, which was very good and cooked just as I asked.  If you're hungry for a burger, but want to avoid the fast food chains, Red Robin is a great alternative.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-beavercreek

The food too over 3 minutes including kids meals. In addition, never got the change to have more fries. The waitress want exactly friendly either. I definitely won't be back.

Chantily R.,"Dayton, OH",136,39,75,3.0,6/26/2017,"I typically enjoy a good Red Robin meal, but my last experience has me feeling like it's not worth me going out of my way to come back for more.  I started off with the Red Spanish Sangria... save your money, because it was BLAND. This drink gives Sangria a bad name. I believe it is here for a limited time, try it for yourself and let me know what you think... maybe I just received a bad batch?!? I literally went this particular evening for their patty melt, and could literally tasty the goodness of the burger, melted provolone cheese and caramelized onions, all sandwiched in-between rye bread. To me, the rye bread makes the patty melt, but to my surprise I was advised AS my burger arrived that Red Robin no longer uses rye bread and instead I received Texas toast. I am not a fan of Texas toast, and had I known prior, I would have changed my order. I didn't want to make a fuss about it, but the ""patty melt"" was not the same without the Rye bread.  #BringBackTheRye Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-beavercreek
Jess H.,"Dayton, OH",82,240,283,5.0,4/17/2017,"I admit, this Red Robin is usually my go-to when I'm craving a good burger.  We've dined here 6 or so times, and with each experience we've had: excellent and friendly service with timely table checks, food (more often then not, burgers) that are juicy and well-prepared, and a cheap bill (great prices for the food received). This place is also very accommodating for large groups, in my case, for lunch meetings. This is a place that seems to plan reservations with their schedule, so you will still receive timely service even in a large number. (This is very important for those that need to be in and out within their lunch hours!) Just make sure you call ahead of time in consideration. :) In my most recent visit, I ordered a few appetizers: the fried pickles and pretzel bites, along with the small doughnut tower. Now, the doughnuts certainly aren't the ricotta doughnuts I know and love from a favorite restaurant of mine... But these ones help fill the void. They're very soft on the inside. However, the chocolate sauce they serve with it has a flavor reminiscent of a child's chocolate lip balm. The berry sauce is decent. If they served a salted caramel and/or much better chocolate sauce, these doughnuts would be terrific!  With great staff and great food, this place is a winner! I know, I know... chain burger place... But good food is good food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-beavercreek
Jason K.,"Downtown, Seattle, WA",1,9,,1.0,8/24/2017,"Worst Red Robbin experience ever.  They were severely understaffed for the lunch time crowd on a normal weekday.  Restaurant looked quite empty, but waited 10 minutes for a table for 4 before walking out once it was obvious we would be waiting much longer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-beavercreek

Justin F.,"Dayton, OH",54,57,16,2.0,8/10/2016,"I was overall disappointed with Red Robin... We arrived around 5:20 on a Tuesday, so they weren't terribly busy. Our server was kind, which is always a plus, but from there everything went down hill. When we had decided that we wanted the boneless barbecue wings as our appetizer, our waitress told us we HAD to use the little electronic thing at our table. First off, I hate those things. I find them impersonal, which proved true. We submitted our order and then gave our meal order to the waitress. When our wings arrived, my wife and I were really disappointed. They had brought us their wings, but had just lightly drizzled barbecue on them whereas there menu shows them coated in sauce. When our burgers arrived I was let down even more. It's not that our burgers were bad, they were just, well, normal tasting. If I wanted a mediocre-tasting burger, we would've went to McDonald's or something... Even better was that it was my wife's birthday, which we mentioned to our waitress so we could us our rewards club to get her burger free. She didn't even wish my wife a happy birthday or anything. Not that they have to, just would've been nice to show that she cared we were there. We were also required to is the electronic thing to check out. Once again, felt impersonal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-beavercreek
Brandon M.,"Winchester, IN",0,3,,3.0,5/8/2017,The meal price was great.  To get a good burger and endless fries for 6.99 to 8.99 is great.   The only probably is slow service (one refill on fries and one refill on water) and we were there for over 1hr and 15mins.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-beavercreek

My choice was the  the whiskey river bbq burger without mayo and for 11$ I don't regret: crispy onion straws, Cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes. Awesome! I also tasted one of my new addictions ""Sweet potatoes french fries"" and they were good. Really good.

You could go to this location as soon as they open, you would walk in and find the whole place packed and you looking at an hour wait.  If you're looking for a fast place to eat before a movie at Regal, I would just go somewhere else. If you've got some time to kill, for sure stop in here and get a Guacamole Bacon Burger, and eat your body weight in bottomless fries.  Also, the hostesses here are always really rude and un-friendly. All the servers I've had here have been really cool, and good at what they do.

Andy K.,"Englewood, OH",69,163,4,3.0,3/24/2015,"One of my friends has a restaurant 'blacklist'.  Going out to eat with him is like navigating a minefield, as he consistently opposes suggestions, claiming ""stomach issues"" or any number of intestinal maladies.  If he really did have foot poisoning or the like every time he went out, he'd never leave the toilet. The reason I bring this up?  Red Robin in Beavercreek is one of the few restaurants that's managed to stay off of his 'blacklist' for years.  As such, this past Sunday we found ourselves in the crowded Red Robin lobby, surrounded by three foot high ankle-biters. Honestly?  That's my biggest problem with Red Robin:  the 'family' atmosphere.  Every time I go there, the place is utterly packed with kids, many of whom are either unsupervised or poorly supervised, leaving the servers to navigate a flood pre-pubescent weasels while trying to deliver food. But, that's not a knock on the restaurant itself, really; just my personal preference.  Red Robin's famous for their burgers, of which they have varieties in spades.  These vary in flavor and topping, but sadly enough, they all seem to taste relatively the same.  That's a telling issue, right there, when the different cheeses all meld together and the patty tastes of so much unseasoned meat. Steak fries, similarly, have come into Red Robin's parlance but these, too, seem mediocre.  Mine came unseasoned, with only the barest trace that salt ever touched them.  The Red Robin menu offered a number of (notably upcharged) dipping sauces.  I didn't indulge, though my aforementioned friend chose the ""Smoky Bacon"" sauce, which he claimed didn't look or taste the same as the one that he had ordered on prior visits.  Didn't stop him from eating it, though! I realize that this review sounds fairly negative; it's not really meant to be, but my entire experience at Red Robin echoes one word:  mediocre.  I feel like I could get a better, fresher experience at Smashburger or any number of sports bars through the region.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-beavercreek

John M.,"Saint Louis, MO",64,281,12,2.0,1/26/2015,"This place was packed.  I'm not used to waiting for a restaurant that won't serve me fresh or local food.  The burger was fine as were the bottomless sweet potato fries and appetizers. Swamped, it is completely understandable that the server was slow and we were always waiting on something/waving him down.  Bottomless fries are only bottomless if you have a server.   The only reason we went was because of the free birthday burger?  Well you have to sign up for a rewards program or something and because our friend with the birthday didn't sign up far enough in advance, everyone wasted their money here.  The rest of the group had apparently come in a week before and done the same thing with the same server for a different birthday.  I'm sure they tipped well before but the service and inability to honor their deal was unbelievable.  We had his ID... it was his birthday... I could have paid 1/3 the price at steak n shake for the same thing and no wait.  I'm so confused.  Maybe my problem is that I can make better at home.  Or that the burgers are $12?

My family raved about the delicious burgers that Red Robin prides themselves on and boy were they right. The good 'ol regular all american cheeseburger rates right up there with one of the best cheeseburgers I have ever had. Super yum!! Their fries were ok. I totally appreciated the suggestion from a fellow yelper to order your fries as soon as you sit down. They made a tasty (and free) appetizer.  We sat the bar and service was ok. Nothing spectacular but nothing to complain about. It was super cool that the bartender let my husband try a beer before he ordered it. Fortunately she did because it did not please his palate so he stuck to good old ___ (fill in the blank because I have no clue what he ended up ordering).

I think the seasoning on the fries is a little bland, but you can't beat the unlimited servings! I gave it 4 stars because of their strawberry cheesecake. I think the cheesecake is just so-so and the strawberry wasn't fresh, it's frozen.

There is movie posters all over the restaurant. They had an ok alcohol solution, the draft beer wasn't fantastic. The actual menu has 2 pages of burgers and 2 pages of non burger options. I ordered the royal red robin which was a burger with bacon, cheese, and a sunny side egg along with lettuce, mayo, and tomato. I also ordered the sweet potato fries for an up charge of $1.49. The burger was cooked perfect and had a great flavor to it. The sweet potato fries were quite tasty as well. I was a little disappointed in the amount of fries I got. I had heard red robin is known for their bottomless fries. So when my ordered came I was expecting a huge amount of fries, when in reality I got a very small amount.

Allison B.,"Saint Louis, MO",137,254,128,4.0,12/28/2012,"Once upon a time, a beautiful princess journeyed for six long hours to visit a friend in the hilariously named town of Beavercreek, Ohio. Famished, she and her friend headed to Red Robin for some much-needed nourishment and merriment.  Inside, the princess requested a salted caramel shake and a Gardenburger patty dressed as the Bleu Ribbon (The princess was a vegetarian and loved that she could have dressed up ""burgers"" here). As she waited for her food, she noted that the air was a bit chilly, so she wrapped her scarf around her arms. Soon, a young maiden of perhaps five years approached her shyly. The girl, dressed in pink, grew wide-eyed and suggested that princess resembled Snow White with her long, dark hair and bow headband. The princess giggled and thanked the sweet girl.  The server soon returned with the princess's meal, remembering to bring barbeque sauce for her fries and an extra glass so that her friend could share the milkshake. The food was hearty as always and precisely what the princess had requested. The shake was so delicious that the princess even briefly considered ordering a second one, but she was growing sleepy from the journey and needed to return to her friend's house to catch up on ""American Horror Story."" When the time came to pay the bill, the server told the princess (after applying her Red Robin Royalty account) that her ""burger"" was free and that only payment for the shake was necessary. The server also leaned close and divulged, ""I heard what what little girl had told you, and she was right - You do look like Snow White. You're adorable."" And with that, the server turned into a prince and disappeared forever. The princess then vowed to always leave her puffy sleeved royal attire at home and only dine in her Weezer shirt and giant glittery bow headband from that day forward.

Mike B.,"Dayton, OH",12,124,196,4.0,4/15/2012,"The Garlic fries are great.  Tip...  Order your refill of fries after you first sit down (when ordering your drinks) and they will come out as appetizers.  That way you have your munchies while waiting on the food.  We picked a busy time to attend, 2pm on a Saturday.  The place was packed, with many parties waiting in the lobby for seats.   After a short 20 minute wait we were graciously escorted to our seats.  The entire staff was friendly and eager to assist us; which is amazing considering how busy they were.  I would like to give a shout out to our waitress ""Jaden"".  She did an awesome job.  Before our drinks were half empty, we had new ones waiting.  She was constantly coming by the table to make sure we were good to go; and always with a big smile. The only negative is that the burgers were a bit dry.   Not sure how they cooked it, but the drained every bit of moisture out.  Thank goodness for the full bottle of ketchup.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-beavercreek?start=40
Courtney V.,"Dayton, OH",5,10,2,2.0,12/21/2013,"Got an overpriced burger that was lackluster in flavor despite the specialty sauces they offer and the bun was beyond dry to the point of cardboard consistency. To make matters worse, I was quite ill afterwards and I have no doubt it was to blame.

S G.,"Dayton, OH",64,28,,4.0,7/10/2015,Came on a Wednesday.  Was quoted 15 minutes . After 30 minutes they claim they seated another party under our name.  Service was Mediocre -drinks took forever and not friendly.  Appreciate the food - great burgers and the fries are great.  Didn't know about bottomless fries - speaks for the service since we did finish every single French fry on our table.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-beavercreek?start=40
Darin M.,"Beavercreek, OH",1,36,,2.0,4/10/2012,"Visited this Red Robin once.  Took my daughter.  We got burgers off the menu, no appetizer and nothing super exotic.   The burgers are supposed to come with endless steak fry refills aren't they?  Just try to find your server to get more.  The burger itself was OK.. Not spectacular. The check came to $34 before tip for burgers, fries and sodas.   I can get Meh burgers for a lot less than that.

Jessica S.,"Dayton, OH",9,26,6,4.0,9/7/2014,"Their tagline sums it up well...""YUM"". This location gets very crowded during the dinner rush hour so I tend to avoid dining here during that peak time as wait time can easily succeed an hour. But if one gets here a little before 5 pm or after 8 pm, a table is easily available. My favorite time to indulge is for a weekend lunch. I've always received great service here-friendly and quick. I've probably visited over 20 times and have never been disappointed with my meal. Favorites are the Bonzai Burger which has a nice teriyaki glaze and pineapple or the Red Tavern Double which showcases their ""secret sauce"". I give props that they now offer sweet potato fries in addition to their Red Robin fries. Both are good and allow for bottomless servings though I've yet to make it through one. I'm enjoying the addition of the sauce offerings as fry accompaniments. The garlic one was quite tasty! Shakes here are de-li-ci-ous!! For a non-alcoholic option try the salted caramel or for those indulging in a festive beverage, go for the Baileys shake. Spend the $1 more to get the shake refill cup. Otherwise, you will wish you had when you reach the bottom of the cup.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-beavercreek?start=40

Kymberlei T.,"West Elkton, OH",18,117,2,2.0,4/3/2012,"The food is good, but the service leaves a lot to be desired. When we got there they were not busy, it was after 9pm on a Monday. We were sat down right away, but our waitress didn't come over to even look at us for about another 10 minutes. When she finally showed up, she was very short and rude. She took our order, delivered it and then barely came back out to check on our drinks or anything!! She just seem to not be able to handle the amount of people she was given to serve.

Robert C.,"Clayton, OH",2,30,,2.0,2/2/2009,"I'm sorry, but I've been here twice and I just don't find the hamburgers to be anything special. When I was here about a year ago, I thought maybe they were having a bad day. Then I went back yesterday and was again unhappy with the burger. I don't know how this place got rated as one of Dayton's best burgers. I enjoy the burger at the Pine Club much better and it's the same price.    On the up side, the steak fries are great and it's what they call endless.   They don't know me......

It's a shame because some of the toppings and stuff seem to be pretty good. Oddly, their non-burgers are much better. Nothing spectacular there either, but not bad. Over all I'd give it a pass. I would almost give them a pass to 3 stars, except that the prices are a bit high for the quality.
