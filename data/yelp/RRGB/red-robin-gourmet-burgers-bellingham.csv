Karen C.,"San Jose, CA",163,507,424,4.0,7/21/2017,"On our drive from Vancouver to Seattle, we stopped here for lunch as we wanted something more than fast food.  We got sat right away and our waitress took our drink orders.  Then when she came back with the drinks, she took our food orders. I started with the fried pickles with ranch dressing instead of the sauce it comes with.  They were delicious.  Crisp tasty crust with a nice pickle chip instead.  And who does not love ranch on the side. For burgers, I had the black & blue burger in a lettuce wrap.  Its a knife and fork burger when you have it in lettuce instead of a bun.  The burger was cooked nicely and had a lot of blue cheese and mushrooms on it.   Mom had the Whiskey River BBQ burger.  She liked it, especially the fried onion strings on top.  And you can't beat their fries.  Nice and crisp on the outside, soft inside. I have eaten at several Red Robins around the country and their food is almost consistent and tasty.  This location was no exception.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellingham

Sarah F.,"San Diego, CA",293,559,191,3.0,1/2/2017,"What can I say, sometimes I get a hankering for their burger with pineapple on it... it's all I get! Is the bun soggy and the burger mediocre? Yes, but consistently so.... Pros? Bottomless fries for those hankering for carbs Consistent with all chains... it's okay and sometimes a bit less than or better than okay  This location seems to keep the bathrooms pretty clean  Takeout is done in a way that nothing gets soggy or seems less good than eating in Cons? Well, to just a chain that tries to do too much Service since they got computers at the tables is poor... like, go use your robot, silly",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellingham

While most of the orders were correct, my nephew asked for Apple slices instead of fries but got fries. I asked for no mayo but got mayo.   Fries were delicious though and the everyone was okay with their meals.   Considering my other nephew, who's 5, recommended McDonald's, I think we did okay for lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellingham
Hunter H.,"Bellingham, WA",6,70,83,4.0,8/29/2017,"Been going here for quite some time over the years. They made quite some changes to the overall atmosphere inside, and to be honest doesn't look as good as it used too. The staff that weve encountered have always been very friendly, and when we have certain questions they answer them without any hassel. As for the food, we love thier cheesy mozzarella sticks, we always get those for appetizers. I typically get the A.1 Peppercorn Burger which is always very delicious, and is doused with A.1 sauce and onion straws. Overall, I definitley reccomend this place, and is a fun restaurant to go to with your family:)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellingham
Steve S.,"Ferndale, WA",55,260,902,4.0,1/1/2016,"After 30 years as a customer at Red Robin, I finally decided to write a review. This review is of the Bellingham Red Robin at the Bellis Fair Mall. My standard burger has typically been the bacon cheeseburger, but recently I have branched out to try other menu items. The whisky river barbecue burger is one that is also one of their better burgers. All burgers are served with bottomless fries, it does take a while sometimes to get the refill, so if you think you are going to want a fry refill, order it early. I tried to order a fry refill before my food arrived and they would not let me do that, which seems fair to me. They don't always ask, but you can order your burgers well cooked, or with a little pink if you like it on the rarer side. For the gluten free crowd, Red Robin offers the lettuce bun, which is done very well. You can get any of their burgers on a lettuce bun. For the over 21 crowd, you can often times bypass the long wait list to get a table, and just grab a table in the bar, if there is one available. This restaurant went through a recent remodel, which updated many areas of the restaurant, but overall didn't really make that much of a difference. And don't forget the free ice cream sunday for those having a birthday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellingham
Amanda W.,"Bellingham, WA",10,24,,3.0,4/13/2017,"While I am a big fan of their clam chowder and my husband likes the burgers, the personal interaction is completely missing at this restaurant.  The fact that they think they can replace personal wait staff interaction with a machine at the end of your table is sad. Why not just go to a fast food restaurant then?  It seems like the restaurant might be over loading the staff because they can just tell you to pay on the machine since they are slammed and don't have time to actually serve you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellingham
Anjuli P.,"Bellingham, WA",139,65,102,4.0,11/7/2016,This place is pretty good! It's my go to place when I'm out and hungry but can't make up my mind.  The service is almost always quick and attentive. I normally sit in the bar area which is always crowded but seems to be quicker than the dining room.  The food is a bit more greasy than I like but it is still tasty! The burgers seem to have gotten a whole lot better in the past few years.  They have a wide variety of burgers and several different options for those burgers which is awesome!!

Morgan B.,"Sedro-Woolley, WA",310,1,,1.0,7/15/2017,"My husband and I eat at this location fairly regularly, but they've lost our business. I sent my husband to go pick up and order we had placed to go. After waiting 30 MINUTES after he arrived to pick it up, he finally got out of there and came home. Upon arriving home we discovered that not only had they added ingredients to my order that I had not asked for, but I was allergic to one of the ingredients.

Alex D.,"Seattle, WA",0,6,,2.0,10/29/2016,"I normally dine in, but I placed a to go order instead for a free birthday burger because I needed to go somewhere and I just needed to use up the offer before it expired. The girls at the front were kind enough to take my order and they told me it would take about 15 minutes. I sat at the front and waited and waited for half an hour until I couldn't handle enough and then I walked up and asked where my order was. The food was finished 15 minutes ago according to the receipt in the bag.  Because of these workers incompetence to acknowledge that my food was just sitting there collecting breeze for a solid 15 minutes and not even bothering to check on it makes me know not to come back here. If I hadn't asked they probably would've just forgotten about it. Luckily the burger itself was free, otherwise I definitely would've wanted my money back.

Lexi E.,"Bellingham, WA",0,5,,2.0,4/28/2017,"My husband loves this chain, but this restaurant has given our family food poisoning twice. The first time, we gave them a benefit of the doubt. Only my daughter got sick the first time (must have been the mac and cheese or birthday sundae because everything else was shared by us, and we didn't have a problem). We just ate there again, and my husband, 3-year-old, and I all came home with...um...less than desirable results. It's a shame. The food tastes good but maybe prep is not up to standard? Would recommend thinking twice before taking the gamble....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellingham
Ria M.,"Bellingham, WA",218,6,11,3.0,7/8/2016,"It's a hit or miss with every Red Robin. Definitely better than the Arlington or Everett location. I would recommend going just before they get busy because sometimes they can half-a$$ cleaning tables and that will just ruin the dining experience right off the bat.  I'm on the more petite side, so if you're looking for a cheaper burger, that will still fill you up and isn't too overwhelming to eat, I highly recommend getting the Red's Tavern Double with sweet potato fries and honey poppy sauce! Has been my favorite for five years! Would also recommend the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap!  Definitely sign up for Red Royalty, but just remember to activate it because I got into the mistake of expecting a free birthday burger with an inactivated card. *sigh* Every tenth burger is free, and trust me, they add up fast, especially if your friends aren't a part of the Red Royalty program.  Don't sing along with them when they sing happy birthday because they will think you're weird. Also, ask for fries to-go when you leave!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellingham
Andrea H.,"Richardson, TX",649,390,4292,3.0,1/27/2015,"Red Robin's is a fun, clean place to meet friends after work for a drink and some pub grub.  They have a standard bar with the usual assortment of beer, wine, and mixed drink options that you would find at similar establishments like Chili's, Applebees and TGIF. Matter of fact, if you changed the sign outside to one of those other names, you probably wouldn't know the difference. The stand out item on the menu is the gourmet burger. The restaurant has combined toppings in different ways to appeal to a wide variety of palates.  Personally, I like the sandwiches, and my go to favorite is the BLTTA served on a  croissant with a side of bottomless sweet potato fries. No typo there, it really does comes with bacon, lettuce, tomato, turkey AND avacodo.  Prices are high and the food isn't memorable enough for me to crave it; however I would come back, but only because my friends regularly meet-up here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellingham
Brad H.,"Kirkland, WA",234,971,115,1.0,3/5/2015,"By far the worse Red Robin I have ever been to. The food quality here is not up to standards of Red Robin in any fashion. The BBQ Chicken (Whiskey River) sandwich was put together with little to no care and had huge globs of mayo and not enough BBQ sauce. This made it so when you picked up the burger, the bun was soaked and you had to eat it with a fork. The amount of fried onions was almost non existent.The sweet chili sauce that you pay 75 cents extra for needs to be a much larger service size to be of value. The menus were sticky, a scary thought. The hostess station did not provide a strong first impression- it was clear you were an interruption when asking to be seated and not provided a warm welcome.  The location is also very old and unkept. Think metal ash trays built into the bathroom wall vanities old- and that is this Red Robin. Red Robin really needs to take away this franchise. The location and chain has so much potential but this location clearly does not want to be a Red Robin location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellingham

Jay J.,"Covington, WA",13,146,68,3.0,5/7/2015,"Red Robin still has the same good food that they have always had.  The staff at this location was friendly and attentive. Food was prepared as ordered.  I'm not a big fan of the changes that they have made in the last year or two. They seem to be shooting for a more high-end feel rather than focusing on a really good burger in a casual atmosphere like they used to have. The portion sizes seem to have gone down and you almost have to eat the burgers with a knife and fork due to how they have changed the presentation. This isn't unique to this location, its across the chain. In my eyes, Red Robin has dropped from a 4 star to a 3 star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellingham

It's hard to imagine how a place that specializes in ""Gourmet Burgers"" can royally mess up an order of burger and fries... but oh yes, somehow they did. They couldn't even get or drink order right. My burger was raw... not just rare, but I think they completely forgot to cook it and just placed it on the bun. The fries were soggy and gross. Server was highly annoying, in our face and unprofessional. Just embarrassingly bad from the minute we walked in to the minute we walked out.

Jennifer J.,"Bellingham, WA",1063,623,5585,3.0,3/25/2014,"Red Robin is one of those places that isn't really on my radar, but the kids love it so we end up going a few times a year.  The place is definitely consistent: the whimsical decor hasn't been touched in a couple of decades (hey, it works!) and the burgers are still delicious.  They've also revamped their menu to include some other dishes, like salads and wraps.  And, of course, they are well-known for their over-the-top drinks and desserts.  The staff is friendly and helpful, and deserve extra kudos for the enthusiasm they bring to singing that ridiculous birthday song over-and-over-and-over-and-over again.  My biggest beef (get it?  ha ha) is with their prices - it was almost $100 to feed our family of 5.  The burger prices aren't bad but they really stick it to you on the drinks and extras.  Oh well, like I said, we don't go too often!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellingham?start=20

My kids ordered off the kids menu and their food seemed processed or microwaved or maybe both so disappointed in this Red Robin in Bellingham.

Marcia S.,"Ferndale, WA",74,23,75,4.0,10/30/2015,"For those of you Gluten tards out there, you really need to try Red Robins burgers in a lettuce wrap. I personally am not a fan of the heavy gluten free breads that are available. However Red Robin cuts the ends off of iceberg lettuce and makes a lettuce bun that works. I have also become a fan of their buzzard sauce poured all over the french fries. If you can tolerate blue cheese dressing, try dipping the buzzard drenched fries into the blue cheese. Yum. For the most part the Bellingham Red Robin doesn't disappoint. Just be aware that they are generally busy and loud.

Scott B.,"Lynden, WA",0,68,5,2.0,3/1/2016,Red Robin is definitely not what it used to be. Their hamburgers lately have just been OK it seems like their portions have gotten a lot smaller. They say you have endless fries but they only bring you about six or eight at a time what a joke. Why don't they just give you a healthy portion of fries at the very beginning. When you run out of fries they are never around which I guess is why when we ordered extra fries we didn't get them until we paid our bill.

We ordered two 22 ounce Kulshan IPAs from our server who was a female as we do every single time we eat at Red Robin.  The server brought over the beers with a two inch head.  By the time the head settled down we had 19 oz beers.  My girlfriend politely asked another server by the name of josh if he could please fill the beers all the way up like they do every single time we have had them in the past.  Josh then went over to another server and started whispering about us.  Our server was then notified and she came to our table to address our issue.  She was rude and extremely demeaning.  She told us that these were 23 ounce glasses and the always pour their beer with this amount of head.  I explained to her that we have been coming there two to three times a week for over a year and never had a pour like this.  She became more rude and obnoxious.  I said all we want is our beer the way we have had it over fifty other times there.  She rudely grabbed the beers filled them up the way they have been every other time and slammed them down on the table and walked away.   We decided to leave and take our business next door.  I am saddened and outraged that this person is serving the public.  Not only did they loose a sale they lost a customer as we will not be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellingham?start=20

Caitlin Z.,"Blaine, WA",0,2,,1.0,9/29/2014,"This is my second trip to this location (against my better judgement) in the last year. My husband has romanticized Red Robin Burgers in his mind; although I tried to remind him about our last (unpleasant and expensive) visit, he wanted to give it one more go. We'd been out on the motorcycle for Oyster Run, and due to some unforseen circumstances we had to return to Bellingham before either of us had eaten anything. So we were pretty cold by the time we made it to the restaurant.  We sat in the bar, and the joint was freezing. I mean, seriously, cold. Then our waitress came and went (she was very prompt at least) and we placed drink/appetizer orders. I ordered a Coke, and it was totally flat. I opted out of telling my waitress, which I understand negates my right to complain. I just didn't want to be ""that"" customer. I wish I had opted to be ""that"" customer. The appetizer came and was quite good. No complaints on that front. Ordering process went smooth and pleasant; waitress made jokes everyone was smiling. No complaint there. When the burgers arrived. . . oh my. I'd ordered extra Bacon, which I did receive; I didn't know it was going to be the tiny/pathetic bacon that they give you on your McGriddle sandwich! I paid extra for sad bacon :( Something about the menu description of ""Thick Cut hardwood smoked applewood bacon"" had me thinking this would be the good stuff. My mistake? Anyhow.... We each ordered our burgers cooked, though Hubby is a Well Done man and I'm on the Pink Team. Neither burger was warm when we received them. The fries were also lukewarm and tasted as though they'd been sat in a fry-hopper for an hour; their texture was mealy and dry. The only redeeming quality of the fries was the garlic sauce I'd ordered to dip them in. Overall, for being a place that has signs everywhere saying ""THE BEST GOURMET BURGER IN 'MURICA"", I felt I could have obtained something of equal or better quality for about a third of the price. Lesson learned: always go to Bob's Burgers and Brew when wanting to drop $40+ on burgers.  tl;dr Save your money and hit the Dairy Queen on Iowa for better burgers at cheaper pricepoint, or spend same money at Bob's for something out of this world (as Red Robin would have you believe you are about to experience at their joint)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellingham?start=40

Haywood J.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,2,,2.0,1/18/2015,"I have been here 3 times in the last year and service is good however tables are always sticky and menu usually covered in sauce or ketchup.  My issue is that they always seat us in the corner at the bottom by the kitchen, which IMO is like the $49 hotel room on the bottom floor by the garbage bin.  Being a visible minority the thought did cross my mind that it might be a race issue.  So after being seated in the corner again another 2 tables of visible minorities were seated in our area.  I wanted to make sure it wasn't just the 3 tables so I walked through the restaurant and unfortunately we were the only 3 seated in the ghetto section.

With that said, my burger was a little soggy, and the fries were delayed because the cooks misread the order.

Mark O.,"Bellingham, WA",163,239,737,4.0,5/31/2011,"Had a pretty good burger and a salmon sandwich here the other night -- cashing-in on a free birthday burger as part of the relatively new ""Bottomless Rewards"" program (Red Royalty). As other reviewers have noted, the bar is quieter, features the same menu (which includes more vegetarian alternatives than most national chains), a full array of seating styles (bar, small table top, and booth), and quicker service. I usually have the ""Bleu Ribbon Burger"" -- crisp onion straws, bleu cheese, chipolte mayo, onion, lettuce, tomatoes and bbq sauce on a large, tasty bun, but on this occasion, I broke with tradition and ordered the ""Burnin' Love Burger"".  Similar to the Bleu Ribbon, but with a little more spice, the ""Burnin' Love"" features a cajun-spiced burger, jalepeno cheese, and salsa in lieu of the blue cheese and bbq sauce and is seated on a jalepeno bun.  Frankly, I was expecting a really hot, spicy burger and was disappointed by how mild it was, but I enjoyed it nevertheless. My companion enjoyed a salmon burger/sandwich which was surprisingly well prepared.  Both meals included Red Robin's ""Bottomless Fries"" which were fresh, hot and clearly cooked-to-order. Service was great!  Red Robin isn't really much more expensive than Boomers, and is competitive with Fiama Burger, offers a full bar and table service.  Aside from the hassle of being located on Meridian on the perimeter of Bellis Fair this is a great spot for a decent meal when you're on that side of town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellingham?start=40

Dee E.,"Central Okanagan, Canada",1,87,,2.0,11/21/2011,"It wasn't my choice to eat at Red Robin...My husband loves their burgers.  I've eaten at Red Robin in Edmonton a few times and thought the food was acceptable. So after a day of shopping we headed over for dinner. I decided to try one of the wraps. It arrived lukewarm with some pretty uninspiring looking meat in a soggy dressing soaked green tortilla. I passed on the fries and ordered the chicken tortilla soup...which was salty and only had a couple of vegetables & no chicken at all. My husband thought his burger was ""ok"" but not as good as some of the others he has had at Red Robin in the past. He ordered a side of yam fries that were actually quite tasty (which I happily snacked on!) The service was good. But there were only 3 other couples in the entire restaurant. I wouldn't bother eating here again. We went to grab dessert at a Mexican restaurant across the street.

Amanda L.,"Toronto, Canada",59,281,11,4.0,2/27/2013,"What started off as a really rocky interaction that would have resulted in a one star rating completely changed because of their customer service. My and my spouse stopped here after a loooong shopping trip for a much needed burger. We started with their steak fries, onion straws and yam fries basket which comes with 4 sauces and is only $5 and drinks. We got well into munching those before we ordered and before I found out they has ""just"" run out of veggie burgers and they didn't have the vegan burgers. Being a vegetarian and knowing NOTHING else on the menu is vegetarian except the salads (and I do not do dinner salads, I want a meal not a salad!) what went through my mind was ""are you freakin' kidding me!?!"" To say at that point I was pissed off was an understatement but I held it in trying not to ruin the evening, going to another restaurant wasn't an option since we already ordered drinks and appys so determined to find a way to make this meal work I began to scour the menu. I ended up ordering the turkey blt sandwich on a croissant without the meat cause it had veggies and avocado, it's about the most filling option on the menu for a vegetarian other then a burger. I told them if they are still gonna charge me for the meat to just bring it on the side (my spouse loves when this happens) but the waitress said they could work out some kind of a discount, I expected about $2 off and a flimsy little sandwich on a croissant. Well, what was served to me was a salad bar on a croissant! They like triple loaded the veggies which places never do! That alone made me happier with the experience, then the bill showed up and they gave us $5 off on a $10 meal. Now that's customer service, I did not ask for extra veggies and I did not specifically ask for a discount and they just did it as though it was normal practice. This has never happened to me before in a restaurant and I commend the management for knowing how to make up for your mistake without the customer having to ask for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellingham?start=40

Andie K.,"Bellingham, WA",2,22,10,3.0,3/4/2013,"Wanted to rate this place higher and I would of except, like many other places they really have gone down hill over the years. I use to come here and I remember them having a wide variety of things on the menu. Now it just seems to be burgers, salads and a few other things - they got rid of the fettuccine alfredo which use to be my favourite. You use to be able to order onion rings as an appetizer and they'd come on this huge tower - now they only give you a few and they don't taste as good. Another thing I don't like is that you don't get just one waitress. They all seem to take turns on the table and you'll more than likely end up with 2 or 3 people helping you. This makes tipping difficult and because of this I usually don't tip well because I'm not sure who i'm even tipping. Every time I've come here they are crowded and there is usually a 15-20 minute wait. I was also disappointed the last time I went here - ordered a chilli burger and it came with almost no chili and a burnt patty. The place is also usually loud. As for the pros - even though they've gone downhill they are still pretty tasty. If you get a seat by the window you have a good view and makes for a great dining experience. The place is well lit and clean.  Theres a tiny arcade area with a few games to keep the kids occupied while waiting.

This was at 345...barely any customer load. The only thing that used to be impressive were the bottomless fries which they have changed now with a different processing, they have no taste now and are probably rejects from the mcdonalds plant compressed together.   Red robin will slowly put themselves out of business with THIS POOR cleanliness , and pinhead bean counter cost savings measures. This used to be my favorite restaurant. I still like the taste of the food, ignoring the fries,  but service and cleanliness are critical.

Allison F.,"Aurora, CO",91,422,49,4.0,4/7/2011,"We have learned to always sit at the bar when at a Red Robin. Always. Quick service, no sticky tables, and it's usually much more quiet. The only space for a party of three was bar seating, overlooking the rest of the restaurant, which gave us plenty of people watching. I always have the bleu ribbon burger and love it. Crispy onion straws, bleu cheese, and bbq sauce = heaven. I enjoy how you can now choose your bun and how they have so many options available. Burgers are typically served pink even when you ask for well done, but not so pink that it's concerning. Fries are questionably dry at times, but they're always more than willing to bring you more baskets of them, until you burst. I have a soft spot for Red Robin as we've gone to this location since I was a wee one.
