Steven B.,"Merrick, NY",25,53,,2.0,9/16/2017,"Honestly wasn't anything special.  I do like that you can order appetizers, drinks and desserts and pay on the tablet at the table.  I asked for a side of black beans with my food and think they opened a can out them in my bowl because it wasn't warm and the beans were hard.  Most likely won't go back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2?start=20
Ronni K.,"Bellmore, NY",0,2,,2.0,9/18/2017,"As another reviewer expressed, I so wanted to like this place!  I monitored its progress for months and when I noticed that it had opened last week, I decided to take out some burgers on Friday night.  I called and spoke to someone and placed my order but had to downsize it when she told me the total.  I was not prepared to spend so much for two very plain burgers.  Instead, I opted for the $6.99 tavern specials and confirmed the price with the young woman on the phone.  I went to pick up my order and it was not surprisingly very crowded but I waited patiently for the ""to-go"" person to take care of me.  First, I noticed that they did not follow my request for no bun on one of the burgers and I had to adjust it.  When I looked at the bill, I noticed that I was charged $1 more per burger than advertised on the website, so I questioned it.  I was told that not all Red Robins have the same special and that I had spoken to someone at a call  center who did not know that my local RR did not offer those burgers.  ""Sorry,"" she said and turned to walk away.  I told her that I would not be back and after eating the food, that decision was validated.  The burgers were just OK and they gave me a bit of indigestion and the fries were lousy.  I can get a much better burger at my local diner and will do that in the future.  It may have only been a $2 discrepancy but the lack of customer service is unacceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2?start=20
Wendy Z.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,7,2,5.0,10/19/2017,First time here. Welcomed with a smile and seated immediately even though it was busy this Thursday evening. Service was great food good. We will definitely be back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2?start=20
James S.,"Wantagh, NY",0,13,,4.0,10/27/2017,Burgers are better than I expected. Very filling wings were good. Service was good. The endless fries were good and the specialty drinks were good too. I went during the week lunch time so it wasn't that packed I can see this place being popular and service being slow but my visit nothing bad to say. Will be going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2?start=20
Robert B.,"Bellmore, NY",0,3,,1.0,9/22/2017,Waited for months to open and very excited. NOT. food was disgusting. Ordered a wedge salad. Never came. Ordered a burger with cheese and tomatoe. Got a hockey puck dried out with cole slaw and mayo. The cole slaw was sour. Fries dried out. What a disappointment. Don't think I'll be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2?start=20
Maryanne D.,"Merrick, NY",0,3,,4.0,9/18/2017,Went on a Monday night and my party was seated right away.  We had no issues with service -wait staff was courteous and helpful.  Manager walked from table to table asking how everything was and if we needed anything.  Food was good - we got bacon cheeseburgers and a BLTA croissant sandwich.  Overall I thought things were great especially considering it has only been open for about a week!  Will definitely go back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2?start=20
Sofia H.,"Rego Park, NY",47,18,8,4.0,9/28/2017,"I must say my first time in Red Robin. I can't complain the food was good. We order for appetizers, the guava and Chips which was good. We also order from the appetizer the fried pickles and they are to die for!!!! Super tasty and crunchy!! If you are a pickle fan you must try it. For our meals we order the salmon entree with the sweet potatoes which are also to die for lol. We also order the burger that comes with the egg very delicious. The waitress was very attentive and on point with everything. The only thing is the parking. This place should try to add more parking spots. Now I know to walk here. Good thing I live a block away. Overall very good!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2?start=20
Erica J.,"Seaford, NY",21,33,43,5.0,10/6/2017,"My sixth time tonight and was great as usual. I always get grilled chicken, fontina, bacon, lettuce, tomato and red onion on an onion toll with whiskey BBQ on the side. Burgers are always good. Tonight we had the fried chicken sandwich, it was delicious. Both of us enjoyed it very much, they must fry in crisco because it was that good! Bartenders and servers are always great. Managers lack common sense- usually happens in chain restaurants. I am in the industry and have maybe complained once or twice in my life, when I did the manager had no concept of what to do. . I'll be back because the food and staff are so great. Great addition to the neighborhood.  Here again. Guess who sucks again? The tall, blonde manager! Maybe she should take a course on customer relations! Maybe try training her staff instead of sitting at a table reviewing her ""numbers"" on a stack of papers that she probably doesn't understand anyhow.  Double tavern burger was great. Although it came with American and I asked for fontina. Also asked for bacon and it's not here. I think the kitchen doesn't know how to read, perhaps.  Maybe the managers should be more hands on and cut their man buns.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2
Lily N.,"Freeport, NY",80,25,43,2.0,12/9/2017,"12/2017  So came for dinner, today.  Ugh, I must refresh the review I previously wrote. Food and service was terrible!! I don't know where to begin.  Wedge salad, look and taste was bland.  Soup came out cold, garlic bread was as hard as packaged breadsticks, or stale. Order fish and chips batter was way too oily. Ordered a side a Manderins and they brought it when we already paid the check.  I give two stars cause the waitress was really nice. She was very attentive. She did try to make sure everything was ok but I still had to write this review. Only because this store has been here for a few now and it hasn't changed from last time to this time.  I probably won't be coming back.  Came for lunch with the family Monday afternoon. Place wasn't busy. They had staff training newbies but at the same time their staff needed work. Very slow slow service. And other servers pass you while your looking for yours and don't ask they they can help you.  But... the food is great!  Delicious, juicy, tasty. Any recommendations needed, have a Burger!! And a tip for them.....napkins. We (customers) are always in need of napkins!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2
John M.,"Bellmore, NY",0,36,,2.0,10/8/2017,"I'm going to come back again to review once they've been here a while. I'll do that because my Red Robin experiences have been good until now. We were excited for the new place and took the first opportunity to visit this week, their third week in business . Waitress was friendly but clearly overburdened. Burger came really rare even though I requested no pink. The endless fries ended because no one came back to our table after two times. I asked for extra napkins, nothing. My wife asked for extra sauce for her sandwich, nothing. Nobody refilled my water and no one ever asked if we wanted more ice tea or something soda. My wife, first timer, said  she would not go back. I convinced her that RR was pretty good and we should try again in a month or so. If this is were my first time to RR, it would be my last. It's really unacceptable since all of their resources should be put into a new store. Only my previous experiences will have me giving this one another chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2
Tricia O.,"Wantagh, NY",4,29,16,2.0,1/14/2018,"Meh. The redeeming quality here is that it is extremely child friendly. There are the signature red balloons for the kids as you leave and all you can eat side dishes included with every meal. For instance my son had a side of macaroni and cheese and could have kept getting refills...forever?  We had a few refills of the fries which were ok but nothing special. I do however recommend the ""light"" burger with some avocado and no bun.  I'm trying to cut most carbs and this was edible and satisfied my craving for a burger.  The location is new and clean, and it's cheap considering the side refills and we had a few adult beverages.  Applebee's better start getting creative with their offerings because Red Robin is a better version of the same. Did I mention I can't stand Applebee's?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2
Beth L.,"Bellmore, NY",278,557,475,5.0,11/13/2017,Yeah so maybe i was back again. Had a long fucking day with buying a car and DMV and shit and i needed some food i had Kiely as my server and she was sweet as pie. So nice. I had my usual i got half to go cause im stressed to no end and i left. The people next to me did nothing but complain and about dumb shit i felt bad for the poor server with the braids. She ws doing her best and they treated her like shit. Shame on you old people who were nasty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2
June F.,"Merrick, NY",100,475,35,3.0,11/7/2017,It's like a fancy McDonald's.  I did enjoy my turkey burger.  Service was good and I like that they were open late Sunday night where everything else closed so early.  I ordered broccoli and it was definitely frozen not fresh but that's why I minuses one star.  The other star that I minuses is simply because it's a chain with lots of unhealthy menu items and you get the feeling that every item was previously frozen before it was cooked.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2
Mikey G.,"Merrick, NY",307,257,549,4.0,10/1/2017,"So happy this new location is finally up and running!, First let me start off by saying Kayla Our waitress was exceptional! So sweet professional and accommodating from the beginning! If you get her consider yourself lucky,Food came out fast on a busy Sunday night! That was very impressive, burgers were very very good, along with the endless fries and dipping sauces,that was very impressive, they have a pretty extensive beer menu but lacking in the wine department, no big deal , place was super clean as well, all this positive stuff and why only four stars you ask?, I felt my garlic Parmesan fries were severely lacking in the main ingredient, garlic and Parmesan! LOL, they need to work on that in the kitchen, also the place was lit up inside like a stadium arena! I hate that!, I know I'm being a little tough here but it is what it is, regardless I will be back time and time again, this is a fine family establishment.Yummmmm!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2
Jackie C.,"Merrick, NY",10,59,36,5.0,10/1/2017,"5 stars mostly goes towards our server. I believe her name was Katie and she was so friendly and knowledgeable. Unfortunately I had requested additional toppings for my burger and when the burger arrived it had nothing on it. Katie offered to take the burger back and fix it up, but I told her she could just bring them to me on the side, no big. The manager dropped them off without saying a single word, while having a conversation with somebody else. I thought that was slightly rude. Katie swung by and made sure everything was ok afterwards and reminded us we wanted something to go. I can tell for a Friday or Saturday night the parking is probably atrocious but on a Sunday it wasn't too bad. Extra fries? Check. Milkshake? Check. Full for forever? Check",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2
Jessie L.,"Merrick, NY",0,6,1,3.0,1/1/2018,"Went to lunch, it was our first time at this location.I ordered the taco burger, the burger itself was good, but they barely put any guac, salsa and no tortilla chips on it. It taste like a plain ole cheeseburger, the garlic fries are tastey, the French onion soup tastes like a bowl of salt, it was a bit much the broth was over bearing with salt, and the fried pickles are very tastey as well. My bf had the siracha burger he said it was good and he'd order it again. Far as the French onion soup this is one of my favs I do order it from diff places but this one by far was the saltiest one I've had. The place is clean and the food is good, service a bit slow but it's to be expected they didn't have many servers on staff today. I'd go back and try other dishes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2
Jasmine D.,"Freeport, NY",1,15,,1.0,9/23/2017,WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!! My boyfriend and I came here after a movie expecting great service like we had the first time coming to this restaurant earlier in the week. We waited 15 mins for our clueless waitress to take our orders. Then we waited even longer for our appetizers but instead she brought out our dinner first and claimed the fryer wasn't hot. We weren't pleased but said okay then just as i cut into my turkey burger and looked at it I saw that it was still RAW IN THE MIDDLE. This made me so sick i asked the waitress to take it away! She was in fact apologetic and so was the manager but it seemed like they didn't care that much as i saw them laughing in the back kitchen. I was barely compensated and I will never be returning to this restaurant again terrible consumer service! Do better,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2
Paul A.,"Merrick, NY",0,11,,2.0,10/9/2017,"BURGER KING AND BREW   drink selection outstanding...bar prices very fair, quality very good on mixed drinks. burger's very tasty, but similar to the burger king angus (however i had the burger king after burger burp the rest of the night..so that made me wonder what else was in the meat?) appetizers expensive and too salty.  fries under cooked and never saw the endless part. initial service was good...but then never saw the waitress again after the final food arrived. the bill calculation for tip rounds things up and includes tax total...and c.c. it seems preferred over cash....which is all done at your table using the little kiosk. i will come back for drinks and  something other then burgers. wendy's is just as good and no after burp.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2

Steven E.,"East Rockaway, NY",2,45,,3.0,9/27/2017,"Went for takeout to bring over to my sons house in Bellmore. A nice young gentleman Dan took my order in the hallway. It was an order of salads,burgers and sides for 2 people. I was quoted and it took 15 minutes. Dan carefully read the order back to me. All downhill when I got to my sons house.Not a single order was correct. Dressings missing.Plain burger request smothered in a million toppings. Only one of 2 sided included.Where is a supervisor? I realize they are new but cmon here. Awful execution. On the bright side food is decent and place is nicely appointed. If they can fix the dysfunctional order entry system they will do fine",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2
John S.,"Merrick, NY",0,16,10,1.0,10/8/2017,"The food came to our table after about an hour wait cold. We ordered a well done hamburger which was pink in the middle and fries, both items were cold. The appetizer we ordered never came to the table and showed up on the bill. Additionally the bathroom floor was extremely slippery, it must have been mopped with dish soap or something because it was like a slip and slide. Service was extremely poor, when asked for additional napkins/silverware don't expect anything soon. This bellmore location is my first red robin experience, other locations of red robin are probably better. Was truly a negative experience",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2
Cindy M.,"Baldwin, NY",36,3,,3.0,9/30/2017,"Ok so we dealt with an incompetent staff right from the beginning, we were a party of 13 the hostesses were waiting for one big table to open up even after we explained we would take the three open tables instead of one Cierra was so busy on her own phone she couldn't be bothered, thank goodness for Mo our waitress super nice and helpful and patient , burgers were really good my advice replace the useless girls at the front door with someone like Moe",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2
Margaret O.,"Bellmore, NY",0,9,,4.0,12/17/2017,We went in Saturday afternoon for lunch. We had no wait and was seated by the receptionist. Our waitress Julia was very attentive and funny. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger which was good nothing fancy. My husband ordered the smokey pepper burger. It was EXTREMELY salty.   Overall it was a pleasant experience mainly because our waitress was that much fun.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2
Faith I.,"Bellmore, NY",0,1,,1.0,12/8/2017,Lady on the phone is the rudest lady I ever talked to. Gave me the biggest attitude and when I asked when it would be ready she said 15 minuites. I go to pick it up 15 mins later and the place is closed and didn't open till 11 but she still took my order. Nasty lady who deserves to be fired. I'm also a picky eater and told her not to put stuff on the burger and she told me that she can't control what they do. Horrible place I recommend never stepping foot in there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2
Frank T.,"Nanuet, NY",4,30,2,3.0,10/23/2017,"wow this neighborhood has been craving this place. i cant believe how busy this location is. still lots of kinks to figure out. service is still getting used to everything, but cant blame them, its mobbed every time i go in there!  for some reason they cant find my rewards number and when i try to bring up my number it can never be found. (from the pos on the tables to the website, im in some super annoying infinite loop of unhappiness). i registered maybe ten years ago in Redmond, Washington, maybe that has something to do with it.  regardless, burger options and menu selection is really good.  fantastic for families, but ill give it another few months to settle down and im sure it will be the perfect staple.  im a sucker for steak fries, so this place has the goods when im looking to splurge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2
David O.,"Merrick, NY",0,7,,1.0,11/12/2017,"Ordered online to go.  Arrived at designated time.  Order not ready until 15 minutes later.  Ordered two burgers, one with no red onions, the other with sauteed onions.  The burger with no red onions had red onions on it.  The burger with sauteed onions had no onions.  Asked for steamed broccoli instead of side salad.  Got 5 florets that were cold.  Extra crispy fries that were ordered instead were cold and soggy.  Just a bad experience all around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2
Stephanie C.,"Merrick, NY",0,4,,3.0,11/9/2017,"Since this is a new burger joint in town, I've been wanting to try this place for awhile. The first time I arrived with my friends, the lines were out the door. We tried again few days later and the wait wasn't that long (15 minutes.) The food was filling and decent, but the prices here are outrageously high. A majority of the burgers ranged from $11-$15. I ordered a guac burger, which was delicious, but also contained little guac in it. The fries were okay, but a tad too salty, as well. The waiters and waitresses are amicable and pleasant, but they took awhile to give us the check when we made it clear that we were done eating. Overall, not a bad place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellmore-2
