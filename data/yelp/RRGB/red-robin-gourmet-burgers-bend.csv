Kevin S.,"Portland, OR",266,234,82,2.0,1/5/2018,"Besides having an interior reminiscent of a bowling alley and the cleanliness about on par with one, I was disappointed from the start. Beer took ages to come to the table, and there's screaming kids running wild in the pit of family tables. The tv nearest my table hasn't worked in two years, according to the manager on duty at the time. And another one nearby just died. It took quite some time for the food to come out including the order of fries, by which i had already downed two tall drafts. Even bottomless french fries isn't enough to drown out the issues with this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend
Joe M.,"Visalia, CA",0,3,4,1.0,7/24/2017,"We we're on vacation and stopped to eat  Service was ok quoted 45 min for a party of 13 witch I don't see why if the restaurant was half empty. Food was sitting in the window under the lamps for about 10-15 minutes and when we Finally got it many burgers and fries were cold, My family didn't say anything but I sent mine back and got something else.  My kid got food poisoning from here she was vomiting and had a fever and stomach pain I called and I was supposed to hear back from the General manager, and still haven't been contacted pretty bad if I say so myself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend
A T.,"Bend, OR",0,15,,1.0,1/5/2018,"This must be the worst Red Robin in the country. The food is consistently cold, soggy and sad-looking and the service ranges from okay to downright rude.  Any way you cut it, this is one of the dirtiest restaurants in Bend. The tables are sticky. Food is always covering the booths and carpet. Oh and the booths are ripped! The bathrooms are a disaster zone. The bar area is unkempt. Their old decor is covered in dust and food splatter.  I love Red Robin; I hate this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend
Gail A.,"Bend, OR",0,15,,2.0,1/8/2018,We waited 45 minutes after we gave our order for it to finally come to our table. After letting the waitress know. We got crispy chicken salads and the chicken was cold and greasy tasting. I think it sat in the counter until it got cold. Our Grand daughters meal was cold. Not real impressed. Plus we think every table had a Birthday at it. Very loud with the clapping.  Not interested I going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend
Lmao Y.,"Phoenix, OR",0,11,,3.0,12/27/2017,"This was a fun time at the old mill district. I ordered a mac and salad which was alright, nothing special, but a good option for a lighter meal. The view of the river added to the atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend

PJ W.,"San Diego, CA",311,33,15,5.0,10/9/2017,Kenna is the server and Ryan the food runner were very good. Got the job done in a friendly  manner and quick turnaround. Customer service was good. Thanks guys,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend
Eddie T.,"Oregon City, OR",0,14,,1.0,10/16/2017,"First off, the food was OK (as expected) but the order was incorrect (ordered sweet potato fries, served regular fries.)   The friendly staff quickly corrected the mistake, but then we had to ask for silverware.  Our server (Julien) was friendly and courteous, but maybe a bit over-tasked with his tables.  Second off, this place is DIRTY.  The table tops have achieved a state of ""PERMA-STICKY"" and the seats had food debris on them when we were seated.  Had to ask for napkins to clean our booth up... yuck.  Chipped paint on the walls, food or beverage splatters on the ceiling above the pass-through.  The carpets and cove-base are filthy... like sticky-filthy.  It's really sort of depressing.  No pay stations at the tables, no mention of customer loyalty program like at other Red Robins... this is like the Red Robin that time (and cleaning supplies) have forgot. We occasionally visit other Red Robins when traveling (Clackamas, Woodburn, etc.) and this place isn't even in the same universe.  Wondering if this is the difference between a franchised store and a corporate-ran store?  Either way, this place needs to be shut down for some deep cleaning and painting, and refresher courses for the wait staff on the small details of service they may be overlooking.   Won't likely be returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend
Lindsay R.,"Bend, OR",78,33,87,1.0,8/17/2017,"It's not kept up, I'm pretty sure the tables never get cleaned. My husband sat in a hole in his seat. The waitress laughed when I pointed out that my kids meatball lollipops had broken breadsticks sticking out of the meatball.

Jake U.,"Bend, OR",3,4,,1.0,10/25/2017,"It used to be good, back when John Churm was at the helm.  we went in for dinner last night after our oldest sons football game. Things have changed greatly and not in a good way. The server was good at first until she took our order. What she wrote down was not even close to what we ordered. After about 25 minutes the food arrives  we ordered 2 sides onion rings, they weren't delivered. I ordered a royal Red Robin nope it was missed, instead something else was brought out I'm not even sure what is was. I told the food runner I didn't order what she brought out she looked puzzled and promptly apologized for the mistake not her fault. I then told her about the onion rings, she reacted right away to fix the issue, after another 25 minutes of waiting my burger finally makes it appearance my family is pretty much done eating at this point. And I was just getting started. Mine was ok, my wife's was burnt to a crisp ours kids burgers looked like they had been smashed by the palm of someone's hand, onion dark brown and greasy due to old fryer oil. no napkins or silverware where brought to the table. It's Red Robin I don't expect world class service Or  food but get your shit together. Also the restaurant has become quite shabby over the last 4-5 years, tables are about to break, and are covered this disgusting sticky Grime. Bathrooms where extremely filthy. Urine all over the place. The restaurant just smells filthy as soon you walk in. We had asked to speak with a manager before we paid our bill we waited 15-20 minutes no manager arrived we just left after paying our bill. I doubt they notified one anyways.If Greg and Teresa Hubert still own this dump they should both be ashamed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend
Jimmy B.,"Bellevue, WA",19,312,125,2.0,7/25/2016,"Red Robin...it's all about the burgers & fries right?  Apparently the kitchen staff doesn't realize it.    But wait, I jumped ahead of myself. After traveling to Bend on business, I was just looking for a quick, good meal close to the hotel.  As I walked into the bar, half the tables were full, and the rest were still dirty, including the bar.  It really didn't seem like the place was understaffed.   I waited for a spot at the bar, before moving to a table that was finally cleaned.  As for the food, their signature burger, the Reds Tavern double, came smashed down with under cooked fries.  They were very accommodating in replacing the meal, but after waiting for a clean table, it was irritating to wait again for my order to arrive correct.  The burger was good, not as good as it usually is at other Red Robin's and the fries were still not their normal deliciousness.   Hopefully this was just an off night. But after reading other reviews, you may want to consider other restaurants in the area. I will say that the waitstaff is very engaging and courteous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend
Dashawn A.,"Vancouver, WA",193,37,15,2.0,7/28/2017,"Did expect much because I've never had that great of an experience at Red Robin but I think this was the worst one I've been to. Overall the restaurant was kind of dirty, there was a really long wait time even though it wasn't that busy. The food wasn't bad though better than I thought it would be honestly. It was freezing in there also. Not a great experience wouldn't recommend",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend

Beth W.,"Redmond, OR",0,23,10,1.0,7/10/2017,We won't be dining here anymore.  Mediocre food.  Not even close to the menu pictures and descriptions.  You also need to shut done and scrub the place from top to bottom.  The layer of filth on the tables and edges is disgusting.  If the dining portion of the restaurant is this bad I can only imagine what the kitchen and Oreo areas look like.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend
Cassie G.,"St. Helens, OR",3,28,9,2.0,6/25/2017,"Red Robin is what it is. Nothing to complain about the menu or options etc. But I've been to a few an this is by far the dirtiest. Service was so so. Our server looked to be about 15 and seemed a little scattered but she was trying very hard and was sweet. For a Saturday concert night I was shocked at how short staffed they were, maybe that is why it was so dirty?

Leah M.,"Bend, OR",1,15,4,4.0,3/7/2017,"I absolutely love Red Robin, that being said the last few times I've been here I have been sadly disappointed.. Food being over cooked, items being forgotten, rude waitresses, forgetting to do the birthday song for people.  The reason I am giving a 5 star review is solely based on this last time I went. It was my 21st birthday, we had a pretty big group. We were seated in a timely manor and our waiter Dylan was the most professional, kind dude. He checked on us and made us feel completely comfortable and welcome. Big thumbs up for Dylan, you guys need to keep him around he's the best waiter I've had there and has given me hope in this restaurant. Great job Dylan, thanks for the awesome birthday!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend
Steve L.,"Bend, OR",21,18,7,1.0,5/28/2017,"This used to be one of our favorite places to eat..........used to be. Hadn't been there in a long time and decided to do a date afternoon with my wife. The hostess podium is dirty and in need of repair. The restaurant could use a lot of cleaning. The table top was old, worn out and sticky.  The menus also were sticky and felt like they were in need of sanitizing.  The servers used to be awesomely friendly and attentive. Used to be. Ours was slow and didn't really seem to care about customer service.  For example; when my wife asked for iced tea, he did not question whether she wanted regular or one of the various flavors they offer, she really wanted to try the raspberry. He brought her regular iced tea and a water for me. As he walked off I asked,  ""what about my beer?"" He turned around and said, ""oh, that will be right out."" When he finally delivered it, I took a few swigs then noticed a chunk of something brown on the bottom of the mug (I should have taken a picture), it looked like bird poop or something. I flagged him down and when he came over I pointed it out to him  and asked what he thought it was.  He said, ""oh it's brownie"" and went on to tell me that they serve dessert with brownie crumbles at the bar where he picks up the drinks. I told him it looked gross. He grabbed a napkin, wiped it off and said, ""there, problem solved."" I'm no expert, but I think most places would have brought me another one without the brown whatever on it.  The food used to be really good...........used to be. Both our burgers were luke warm when delivered to our table. The meat was 1/2 as thick as they used to be and although we both ordered them with ""a little pink"" they were both over cooked and dry. The Whiskey R8ver BBQ burger hardly had any BBQ sauce on it and although I ordered it without onions, yup, you guessed it, it had onions. When the server came by and asked how everything tasted, I said, ""ok, but I ordered this without onions."" His reply, ""oh, I didn't even think about the shoestrings."" We used to really enjoy our visits at Red Robin.............used to. Next time I am craving a good burger with a big juicy patty, served hot and the way I ordered it,  we'll go to Hardy's on 3rd street in Bend or Big Belly Burger and Brews in Sunriver.  Bye, bye Red Robin. I won't be wasting my hard earned $$$ there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend
S B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,26,4,1.0,6/21/2017,"Great setting on the river, nice waitress that took our order. After delivering our food she vanished.  I craved a good salad and ordered the Cobb salad. The menu said mixed greens but all iceberg. Salads were very light on condiments, maybe a half a piece of bacon, and maybe a teaspoon of blue cheese, couple pieces of egg.. twelve fifty, really! They both had a mini chicken breast, really disappointed. We rarely get fries so when we do it's a treat. These were saturated in grease and soggy, unedible. When a server finally brought the bill he took off the fries. They do have very cold beer.  I suppose stick to burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend?start=20
Linnea S.,"Sheridan, OR",101,6,,4.0,6/27/2017,Red Robin is what it is and I got what I expected. I would go back. Service was friendly and relatively prompt. I had a burger that was good.

Dawn D.,"Austin, TX",0,5,,1.0,5/29/2017,"This is one of the dirtiest restaurants I've ever been to. The hostess laid our kid's menu right on top of some food left in the table from the previous diner -- either oblivious to the fact that the table was poorly cleaned or ignoring it. We asked them to clean the table and specifically asked them to fold down the table edge and clean in the crack where the table folds down. EWWWW. It's obvious that cleaning is a low priority. Even looking around now, the floor is littered with paper, crayons and just... trash. The chrome bar running behind our table is riddled with grimy fingerprints. I don't even want to think about the menu. Why is our table sticky? I need to go wash my hands. Again.  And, BTW, what's up with the TV in the bathroom stall?!

Linda K.,"Bend, OR",36,145,131,4.0,6/29/2016,"Now I know fours stars is high, especially for a town like Bend with great eateries. This is four stars for the kind of restaurant this is, family burger joint with some other food options. Price point is decent for a burger that is served to you and order taken at the table, $10. The fries are bottomless and tasty with the Red Robin seasoning salt. Food is pretty consistent here. You know what you are getting. Not fabulous but good enough. Besides burgers, the chicken strips are meaty and not too covered in breading. I always get the Whiskey River BBQ chicken wrap. My son likes the BLTA served on a croissant. The daughter varies between a Simple Burger vs Gardenburger. Burgers can also be served on lettuce only. They also have turkey burgers. The atmosphere is loud and so very family friendly. No one will be bothered when your younger child fusses. Lots of birthdays here. Singing and ice cream provided. Really the best thing is appetizers on the deck, in my opinion. View of the river. Old mill atmosphere. Just really quite nice and not terribly expensive! Tried the deep fried broccoli last night and liked it!! Also there is a $3 wedge salad that is the best deal around!! So yes, this is a chain. It is loud. The food is good enough. The price is fair. Lovely location. Customer be aware of where you are going and you will be happy. Don't set those expectations too high!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend?start=20
Amber E.,"La Pine, OR",0,1,,1.0,8/30/2017,"Back in the day when this location first opened when I was in High school, it was the place to be and go and honestly the food was good for the price , but now days,I I should of wore some lipstick before I got f'ed!!! I ordered the blue cheese angus burger which didn't even have a price by it so I assumed 12.00 at the most. My parents got the 6 dollars siracha deal they had going on , thats what I should have got they bring me this burger on a ""fancy yuppie plate"" I guess to give the illusion it was huge, it looked like a slider , tiny little burger!!! My parents burgers where 5 x bigger and better tasting and looking then the check comes , at this point my stomach was starting to gurgle and I knew I was about to blow blue cheese out my ol' bung hole in their bathroom but I pinched my cheeks to read the ticket.... 15.45 for that f'ing slider that had already went through me , needless to say thank god the shopping centers are close because I had to purchase a new pair of panties after getting f'ed.I will leave Red Robins shitty chain food alone for now on.

We went there with friends and was hoping for the normal great food. DIDN'T happen. They were out of the black angus burger patties and the burger they served to replace it wasn't even as good as McDonalds would have been.

But, unfortunately our order took over and hour in a half to arrive at our table; which was delivered my the 'manager' her name tag stated.

MrsYo ..,"Bend, OR",1,5,,1.0,7/1/2016,"So disappointed! My family (party of 9) and I have enjoyed coming to RR restaurants for years. But it was a ""thumbs down"" kind of night at RR yesterday. Arrived about 6:15ish, 35 min wait ended up being 45 min.No problem it's a Thursday night. We get it :) Finally seated and the table looked wonky, milkshake, ranch dressing, crumbs under table. Asked if it could be cleaned. No problem - cleaned :) Menus were sticky and greasy.No problem it's 7pm a lot of people have come through :) Who's our server, Ryan? No. It must be Joe? No. Oh wait it's Megan after about 10 minutes. We ordered drinks and fries. Got drinks but no fries :( Had to flag down Megan to order food and remind her about fries :( Finally ordered and after a little while fries were brought to us, no sauces :( Ate the fries but wait, napkins? Oh, can you let Megan know we don't have napkins but wait she's busy with the customers at the next table. When she finishes she turns and asks, do you need napkins? Not anymore we wiped hands on our pants! :( Oh look, Wheel of Fortune is on ""Is it past 7:30?"" Yes! :( FINALLY the food arrives, it's good :) But we don't see Megan for awhile so we flag down Joe to change the tv channel because the Olympic Trials are coming on at 8! Thank you Joe :) To-go box? Asked a server walking by for a box. Didn't get server's name she brought 1 box! Thanks! :) By now my happy birthday isn't so happy and I don't want the free sundae! 7 of us leave before Megan FINALLY comes with the check. But my hubby says she did ask if I wanted the sundae.

The blonde barkeep with too much cleavage and not enough tact said, loud enough for everyone in the bar to hear, ""How the f@&k should I know? Tell him to use his f@&king smartphone!"" Brad returned a moment later with the number. Brad five stars all the way.  Blonde barkeep, one star .  I'm sorry we caused such duress asking a bartender for the number of a taxi. I think this was a unique experience for me as I've never been in a bar that didn't have a taxi company's business card taped next to the cash register. But maybe you haven't been a bartender long. Maybe you just got expelled from charm school.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend?start=40

You either get it with your meal or seriously now, after. Refills on drinks won't happen and the endless fries are so small you have to order multiple times and they seem to take their time getting them. The burgers used to be sent through machine and slightly grilled. Now they grill them and burn them every time regardless of some pink no pink or well done.

I ordered the guac-bacon burger, add mushrooms, with cheddar cheese, and sweet potato fries. Our food orders came out together. My plate had french fries on it. I immediately mentioned this to the server, and he said he'd get me some sweet potato fries. I bit into my burger, and realized there was no cheese on it. I asked the server for some cheddar cheese. He offered to have my burger remade, and I declined. I just wanted the cheese. After he brought me the cheese, he checked my ticket in the computer and said he had put everything in correct, and the manager was speaking to the kitchen about the issues. A few minutes later, the manager came out and told me the server had put the order in wrong. I work in the food industry, and I KNOW that whatever comes up on the receipt is going to be what was put in. The receipt had what I ordered on it, not what came to the table. So, I ask the following questions: 1) Where are my sweet potato fries? 2) Where is my cheddar cheese? 3) WHY IS THE MANAGER TRYING TO LIE TO ME AND TRYING TO COVER UP A MISTAKE THAT WAS MADE BY THE KITCHEN?!?

The third time he came by he said she was just now wiping down our table and should be over to get us in 5 minutes. Huh?! Empty restaurant and a half an hour later...still don't have a table.

We go here once a month for the fish and chips which are, to me, the best in the area.

We've been to many Red Robin's all over the western USA, and the location of this one in Bend Oregon is one of the nicest places in the entire west. It's just beautiful here. But after about 15 visits to this location we're getting reluctant to go back because the service is consistently so incredibly slow. The waitresses are very courteous and friendly, I'm not sure why it's so slow. Also they have like the endless fries, well, if they never come back to ask if you want more that's kinda pointless. One time my wife flagged down the young lady, and 20 minutes later she'd still never brought anymore. Another 20 minutes from when you've obviously ended your meal to getting your check has to be a record of any place I've ever been. Lastly, we always go at off times, we never go during the rush hour, like instead of 12 noon we go at 11:15 AM, or instead of dinner time we go at 4:30 PM, but it's still slow.

The fish and chips are actually really good.  And we loved the wedge salads, crisp and satisfying, a steal for $3.

Came a little after 3pm on a Saturday. Not too busy, we were seated promptly, the waitress asked what she could get us a little fast, but we knew we wanted a good local IPA (which they don't have good choices of). She got us our beer, asked us what we wanted to order -we weren't ready, she came up not even a minute later (and I felt she was in a hurry at this point). Then we're ready to order, I put the menus at the edge of the table to show we were ready, FINALLY after at least 10 minutes a different waiter came up and said the other girl was busy, and took our order (2 new gourmet burgers).  We waited.... and waited... and waited........ and waited. My fiancé ordered a 2nd beer. We waited.... and then we noticed the couple sitting at the table across from us that got seated about 15-20 minutes after we placed our order got their food!!! We FINALLY got our food and -- low and behold --it was COLD -all of it!, the fries, everything.  I was starving, but this was unacceptable ----especially to pay $13.95/each for?? And they didn't look good, it was obvious it had been sitting for a while.   So we just simply, without making a big stink, said it was cold, we're not eating it, just cash us out and we left. It happened the last time we were there. They apologized (not profusely or anything), didn't offer anything -no discount on the outrageously expensive beer, or anything -just said sorry. I had gotten a 22oz (yes, they are pretty big), and my fiancé got 2 16oz beers. The bill came to over $18 bucks. Uuggh...quite disappointing. We will never go here again.

Buns are cheap with painfully obvious frozen patties that are thinner and lower in quality compared to fresh hand crafted beef patties of the past. Serving portions of fries reduced to a minimum that make it disuading to keep  asking for more. Caesar salad is now a small head of romaine lettuce placed intact in a bowl with a little bit of dressing drizzled on top. Seriously, you can't even cut up the lettuce? Oh, and finally for dessert, a Oreo ""milk shake"". A SMALL amount of crappy vanilla ice cream cut with probably skim milk mixed with the equivalent of one oreo for $3.99.

Surprise, surprise, surprise.....in my best Gomer Pyle impersonation....no ""Sweaty Gym Sock Smell"" when we walked in.  Although ti was late evening, after 9pm, there were still a few people dining and we were promptly seated.  Service was quick to provide waters and the usual push for appetizers...which we declined. The menu offered a few new chicken sandwich items which looked tasty and so my wife and I opted to try one.....I think it was the caprese chicken sandwich?  Daughter stuck with the teri-chicken sandwich and son had his old fave: Guacamole Bacon Burger.  (They have gone to Red Robin even when we haven't). Service slipped at this point as we waited....and waited....and waited for our food to be delivered.  After about 30 minutes, our server came by and apologized profusely for her error in forgetting to submit our order.  Okay...mistakes happen. She offered to bring us out some fries while we waited. It's now about 9:40 pm. Again, that sounded fine. But then.....we waited ANOTHER ten minutes for the fries!  Side note here:  If it were me?  I would have brought those fries out Johnny on the Spot.   Anyway, when our meals finally did arrive she said she would talk to her manager about taking one of the burgers off the bill. That sounded good.  When the bill arrived she said they took $15 off the total which was better than just taking off a ""burger"".    As for the food itself, standard Red Robin fare. Good but not the best I've had. For $9 burgers, better can be had around town (in my opinion). The bottomless steak fries are nice (if not the most healthy option available....but we love 'em.)  Plus column for this place: 1) Open Late 2) Known quality & quantity.  3) Fairly reasonable prices for what you get.  4) Convenient location down by the theaters.  Negative: Service can be hit or miss. And then....there could always be that smell.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend?start=80

And those pretzel bites apps are SO good I can't stop myself whenever I'm in town. Ultimate margarita is awesome too. Whenever I go in there, everything is served to me systematically and everything comes out quick and deliciously! Typical burger joint feel and food.

Helena W.,"Fremont, CA",16,121,28,4.0,6/27/2011,"Was in town with a group of 8 looking for a place to eat in Old Mill District. Red Robins caught our eye because it is big and one of those really cool retro ones, which where I am from is rare.  Food and service were good. Nothing too exciting, just your standard family restaurant. What makes this place exciting is the atmosphere and space. It's very family friendly, but there is also quite a large bar so good if you want alcoholic beverages.  No complaints about this place, but nothing special. It's has nothing to do with the local cuisine, but it's an easy dining location if you're feeling a bit brainless and want grub ASAP.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend?start=80
Martha R.,"Clinton, MI",107,855,475,3.0,5/20/2008,"I like Red Robins. And this one is just as good as any other... and apparently is one of the busiest in the US. We had good service from a young kid, and my burger was done just the way that I asked. It's not the best place in the whole world to get a meal, but Bend is lacking in burger goodness, so I'd certainly head here again to get my burger-fix on. If you're headed out alone for a quick meal, I like sitting at the bar here. They have the TVs and there is decent people-watching. Probably this is one of the best Red Robins that I have been to - but again, it's just Red Robin... good food, but not great. And because the ticket items aren't that high, you're not looking at people serving you that are actually making a career out of being a server... so, you're probably going to get a kid that provides average service. Works for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend?start=80
J H.,"Granite Bay, CA",0,65,13,5.0,7/9/2013,Red robin now offers gluten free hamburger buns. That really opens up the menu for those who need to eat gluten free.

Jessi C.,"Bend, OR",1,2,,3.0,9/7/2010,"We visit Red Robin in Bend about once or twice a month. Red Robin is what it is... A chain restaurant.  I can say it's always clean and consistent with food quality.  Service is always pretty good good but they could always be a bit more ""willing to please"". I would recommend the burgers ""lettuce wrapped, with light mayo, no cheese, no bacon"" if you are trying to eat low calorie. Also never eat fried food when losing weight because there's twice the amount of calories in fat... Fried foods are loaded with fat. I also drink water or unsweetened tea as well.  If you are not watching calories the Mai tai is the best in town at RR.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend?start=80

While it can be crowded they are very efficient in seating and food delivery. Hats off to this location and though it is a chain, has exceeded many places in Bend from an overall and service experience where the food is twice as expensive!

Brandi L.,"Bend, OR",28,88,,2.0,2/15/2009,"We went to Red Robin last Friday night out of hungry desperation when we realized that our dinner options at Winterfest weren't so hot.  With toddlers in tow, my husband, friends and I decided on Red Robin for a convenient, kid-friendly meal.  I now remember why I don't go to Red Robin. The place was packed with families and we had about a 20 minute wait for a table.  Whatever, that was to be expected at 6pm on a Friday night.  What I DIDN'T expect, though, was to feel like I was being rushed.  I didn't even have a chance to get my 2 yr old into his chair before the server was tapping her food and demanding my drink order.  Dude, chill--I'm trying to keep my child from running up to the table next to us and stealing a french fry! She came back about 2 minutes later and wanted to take our order.  I hadn't even had a chance to look at the menu yet.  She rolled her eyes when we asked for a few more minutes to look over our menus.  I hate feeling put on the spot like that. I ordered the banzai burger, the husband had a cheeseburger minus the cheese, and I ordered spaghetti with apple slices for our mongrel child.  We decided against ordering an appetizer since the other Red Robins that I had been to in Arizona brought out a complimentary basket of fries while you wait for your food.  This is not the case at the Bend Red Robin.  Luckily my friends who also have a toddler had a baggy of goldfish crackers.  Otherwise it could have gotten rough and condiment bottles would have gone flying. Our burgers were alright.  Not terrible, but certainly not anything amazing.  And at 10 bucks a pop (pricing is higher here than the AZ RR's) I wish I could have said that it was worth it.  Um, not really. I was only halfway through my burger when the server came up and gave us our check.  Seriously?  Who does that??  I was annoyed and felt like she was trying to push us out to get the next set of unsuspecting diners for her to rush into our table.  She never offered to bring us refills on drinks, just wanted to get us outta there.  I was bugged that I spent $40 for 2 burgers, 2 beers and a kid's meal.  We would have been better off going to McDonalds--would have been a lot easier on my wallet and about the same quality of food. Even though it's a ""kid's place"" and we have a kid, I don't foresee that we'll be headed back to Red Robin again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend?start=80
R. V.,"Bend, OR",0,4,,1.0,1/21/2014,"Why even have a road side/ to go pick up and tell us ""15 minuets tops"" and then make us wait on average 30 minuets? I've given the inside a try time and time again and them went to the ""to go"" self pickup because i figured I'd at least then have my food sooner. This is the 3rd time I've come in, been ignored, and have seen my food sitting waiting to be boxed but the servers are too busy playing on their phones and talking to their co workers to even care to ask if I could be helped. My food has come to me cold and I only live 10 minuets away from old mill. This is pathetic. Bend burger is less then a mile away and has better service and food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend?start=80

Pete N.,"Sisters, OR",0,2,,4.0,1/4/2014,Great Red Robin! The service from our server Michael was excellent.  Everyone on the staff seemed friendly.  There was a huge line when we came in and the staff managed to work the crowd and get people moved through really quickly. I would have given 5 stars but my burger was a bit charbroiled and there is a huge difference between well done and almost burned. Overall I would recommend the Bend store highly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend?start=80

Laurie S.,"Castro Valley, CA",116,277,2,1.0,12/20/2007,"So, here we are on vacation visiting the in-laws for the Christmas holiday. Didn't get the Santa photos done for the kids before we left, so we headed down to the Old Mill District to see Santa. After the fun of taking this years Santa photos, we decided to head over to Red Robin, since it is in general a family friendly restaurant and we had the two little ones. We were greeted nicely upon entrance, but the service went down hill from there. We asked for a table for 3 adults and two kids, one needing a high chair and the other a car seat sling. The hostess took us to a table that really was not in a good spot for having the extra bulk of the two specialty chairs. She promptly brought the car seat sling, but forgot about the high chair, so hubby and to hunt it down. Since an adult needed to sit near each child, one high chair would either block the entrance to the pick up station for the bar or it would block the other guests getting in and out on the other side table. We chose to block the employees.  Our waitress was quite friendly, but that is where her waitress skills end. She took our order, brought our drinks, and some crackers for our 3 year old,  and that was the last time we saw her. We asked her a few times for a refill on our drinks, but those never arrived. Finally as we were packing up to leave she did bring some refills. DUH! Too late sister! The food was standard Red Robin, you definately get what you expect there.  Decent, but not the best. I would give them a second chance, but make sure you pack your patience.  I must add, that the restaurant was not busy. It might be easy to assume it was since it is the season for everything to be busy, but I would say there were only about 15 tables being used at the time we were there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend?start=80

Liz G.,"Portland, OR",25,124,,1.0,8/27/2008,"We both wanted burgers and were determined to sit outside while we ate them.  I'm not sure why we had such a hard time accomplishing this, but we did, and we ended up at the Red Robin.  In our defense neither of us had ever been to a Red Robin before, generally preferring local establishments, but they claimed to have gourmet burgers and they had a huge patio.  Now we weren't expecting much.  I imagined it might be like TGI Friday and he was picturing Applebees, so you'd think our expectations would be sufficiently low.  You'd be wrong. The menu boasted about a million different kinds of burgers.  We opted to keep it simple - cheeseburger and diet coke for me, bacon cheeseburger with onion rings subbed for the standard steak fries for him. My soda was flat and extra syrupy.  I asked the waitress for a new one from a different machine.  She seemed confused but complied.  Same thing.  We mused that perhaps the typical Red Robin patron prefers their soda extra sweet and syrupy.  Oh well.  I drank it.  It was caffeine.   Our burgers were served in plastic baskets and I thought the steak fries looked disappointing so I switched them for onion rings, which the waitress was nice about.  At this point I should mention that both the soda and fries have free refills.  Pretty standard on the soda, but who's eating multiple servings of fries?  Anyway, I wanted to adjust the condiments on my burger.  Too bad silverware doesn't come standard at Red Robin.  I actually had to ask for a knife.  My mind was flashing images from Idiocracy and I had memories of the Friendly's chain from the east coast (only their food comes on actual plates, and with silverware).  I considered asking our waitress what exactly was gourmet about the burgers.  Was it that particular amount of grease?  Or maybe the fact that it was served on a potato bread bun?  Alas, I didn't, I'm working on being less snarky with servers.  In the end we tried to put a positive spin on the whole situation, reminding ourselves that we're fortunate enough to rarely eat such tragic food, though he still had a hard time paying $10 for a burger served in a plastic basket on a potato bun.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bend?start=80
