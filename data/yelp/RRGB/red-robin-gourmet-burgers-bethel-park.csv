Aya O.,"Charleston, SC",0,8,1,2.0,7/16/2014,"The burgers were mediocre, nothing special. The French fries seemed like they were just microwaved and weren't very tasteful. The Oreo milkshake was very good but no very thick. The atmosphere was ok and the waitress was pretty attentive. The food lacked taste and wasn't really worth it...

Carrie L.,"Pittsburgh, PA",278,198,323,3.0,7/9/2011,"Red Robinnnn   [YUMMMMMMMM]    Sorry... it had to be done!   Anyhow, this one is very much like all of the other Red Robins out there! Located inside of the South Hills Village Mall (at the former location of The Roxy Restaurant), its quite smallish inside for a Red Robin location. It can be absolutely nuts on the weekends with families trying to get a table for 7 on a Saturday night, so steer clear of it on weekend nights! The food was average, at best, and of the same quality standards as all other Red Robin locations (which sits at ""just below average""). Burgers and chicken sandwiches are the main event here, though there are some salads and Roast Beef Au Jus sandwiches, too. Service was very friendly today (7/9/11), but there was no pre-bus which is a huuuuuuge issue for me!  I want those dead soldier dishes taken away from my table ASAP and hate it when restaurants/servers fail to deliver (or remove, as it were). We also sat with our check (ready to pay) for quite some time before our server finally took our card for us. The Breakdown PROS: Food Quality is Consistent to all other locations; Service was Friendly (though the hostess staff was pretty disorganized); Refill service was fantastic! CONS: NO Pre-Bus!   GRRRRRRRR! Failed to cash out our check in a timely manner (we seriously sat for a looooooong time to get outa there!) FOOD RECOMMENDATION? I liked the Roast Beef Au Jus Sandwich (mentioned earlier)! The meat was good quality and not gross at all.  The bun was nice and chewy.  The Au Jus coulda been a bit more flavorful, however. [sorry, though I usually try to comment on the facilities, I didn't use the bathroom in this location.]",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park?start=40
Hank L.,"Bethel Park, PA",4,47,1,2.0,8/7/2013,"The burgers are overpriced but the unlimited fries are nice. I'm not one for the whole ""gourmet"" burger scene. I grill better burgers than I can buy. If I'm jonesing for a sub-par burger, a Whopper from Burger King suffices and it's a quarter the price. The atmosphere is chaotic but the kids love it so I'll bump it a star.  If I had to compare it against Five Guys and Fuddruckers, I'd say Five Guys burgers taste the best, Fuddruckers gives you the best customization, and Red Robin is a blase third place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park?start=40
Taylor S.,"Lake Jackson, TX",30,14,,4.0,2/1/2014,Awesome burgers! Drink seemed a bit watered down and chips with guacamole was a small portion. But it's all about the burgers and they were great!

Lesley M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",4,41,,4.0,7/25/2011,"This is the sort of place you can take a group including meat-eaters, vegetarians and picky children and have them all find something they like on the menu. I prefer their blue ribbon burger (with a Gardenburger) to pretty much any veggie burger I've had in Pittsburgh. I am personally not a fan of steak fries, so I always get a salad instead.  Negatives: It is loud in here (although that's not always a negative if you have kids). There's always a wait unless you go at a really wacky time.

Patti T.,"Pittsburgh, PA",13,43,1,4.0,8/29/2010,"Brand new location but these people have it together! I've been to this new location twice and had to wait just a short while both times. There is a bar, which has been at 100% capacity both times, but you are able to walk up and order a drink while you wait. The hostess did this for us on our first visit, which I thought was an excellent and surprising level of service. The burgers are fantastic---SO many to choose from! I've always gotten the bacon cheeseburger...call me predictable. But I know what I like. Bacon. Burger cooked to your doneness preference (pink/no pink) served with endless fries. Food arrives quickly and served by whomever is available near the kitchen when the order is put in the pass. I think that makes SO much sense! Manager-types aplenty asking if everything is ok, willing to refill drinks and run for napkins (you'll need them) Reasonable price $15 or less/person.

Darren W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2949,1450,4662,4.0,4/12/2015,"I've still gotta lay into the chain-haters over Red Robin, 'cause I can't say that there's a single thing wrong with their burgers! And this was evident yesterday when Kay found herself with a coupon for a free burger for her birthday month.  The DGB (Damn Great Burger) is one of RR's newest inventions and features oven-roasted tomatoes, a roasted garlic aioli, an on-board mini-salad of fresh arugala dressed in a citrus-infused olive oil and a toasted, flour-dusted ciabatta bun. Tasty and exceedingly tidy thanks to the absorbent and sturdy ciabatta, the DGB's mildly charred and nicely seasoned patty was cooked to a fine mid-rare while the tomatoes brought a sweet smack to counter the tart arugala. I added pepperjack cheese to ramp up the twang a little, but the rich and piquant mayonnaise not only had a say in the matter, it nearly made the burger. I don't know how RR does it, but they do it well. Nothing about the burger tasted processed or flash frozen.  Look, it ain't BRGR. Red Robin operates at a different level and price point, but for a chain, I can't say RR puts out a crummy burger at all, and hell, they're even creative about them.  The ""Bottomless"" fries are another matter. While not an abomination in the eyes of Demeter, there is something a little bland about them, but their house seasoning is on every table to remedy that. Let's say I usually don't ask for seconds.  And wouldn't you know that my very first brush with the doughssaint/cronut craze happened in a suburban Red Robin franchise? RR calls 'em Towering Doh Rings and serve 'em in quantities of 4 or 8, all of 'em rung around a thin metal pole like horseshoes at a family reunion. What to say about them? They live up to their hype and description. What they really remind me of, though, are those sugary doughnut balls that American Chinese joints often sell. Or Indian batura bread? They had the fluffy/crispy texture I expected, and unexpectedly, two dipping sauces: Hot fudge and a sort of raspberry puree (remember that Prince song?) I surprisingly leaned towards the tangy berry juice, savoring each puffy, oily morsel as it was coated in saccharine grit.  Another odd and even newer dessert RR is offering these days is called Chocolate Fruffles. RR calls them ""soft fudge brownies,"" but they're more like cold, flat candy bars topped with sea salt and sugar crystals. These too come with a berry dipping sauce. Eh, I might have enjoyed them more if I'd been eating them inside the nearby Carmike Theater, but passable they were.  Hey, they take chances and thus take my dollars.  Oh, the service wasn't bad either. P.S. The guac 'n chips we had as a starter would give Mad Mex's version a good match anytime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park?start=20

Jan M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",7,140,24,1.0,3/27/2015,"Red Robin, ummmm, NO. You've fallen into the category of overpriced, poorly prepared food, and poorly run establishments. How is it on a early Thursday evening, (before 5p.m.) your food is cold, rubbery, and unappetizing?  My daughter ordered the Chophouse BG, and I got the Cod Fish & Chips, the fries were cold, and not thoroughly cooked. The fish were 4 fist sized chunks of cold, tough, and not crispy, or crunchy pieces of bland.  Fish & Chips for $12.99, cook it right, or take it off the menu, and stick to burgers.  Our server was slower than the cold patch crew for potholes. She was either having a hard time juggling her tables, or just the typical representative of this Red Robin.

But the last 2 or 3 times we've gone there, it seems to be getting worse. The quality of the food has gone downhill, too. I have a feeling they are cutting back on the ingredients quality, but that is just my opinion. The pineapple on the Banzai burger seemed less than proper. And now they have these new little kiosk monitors on the tables remove your server from the dining experience. After the meal, we got our check and the server took the check and giftcards we were paying with and returned the receipts for the giftcards. No check. We had no idea how much of the giftcards were applied. And then, the server was nowhere to be found, I would rather drive to Washington (25 minutes) than go to this location (5 minutes).

We got the honey Dijon boneless wings to start and they were so good! I got the bacon cheeseburger with a cup of French onion soup substituted in place of the French fries. The French onion soup was okay and a decent portion size but a bit on the salty side.   My boyfriend got the Burnin' Love burger with fries.  Unfortunately, about 1/4 through his burger, he realized it was a bean burger and not a beef burger. He let the waitress know and she apologized and gave him the correct meal free of charge to-go since he was already quite full at this point. They handled it swiftly and appropriately.

She told us that they had a newer chef, but the problem was immediately rectified.  The only issue we really had was that she never asked us whether we were loyalty members, which we are, and we needed to pay our check with the little table kiosk in order to get the 20% military discount. We had to turn the machine on and thankfully since we had been before it wasn't an issue for us to log in and pay the check that way and get our discount.  My husband and I went with 2 of their newer burgers, the Mad Love (pricey at $14.49) and the Southern Charm($13.99).  His was the burger missing the onions which we did receive later, and mine was loaded with bacon, crispy cheese and avocado.  I loved mine and he was very happy with how his tasted as well.  Lots of goodness on those 2 babies.  Yum.  Overall we were once again happy with choosing RR.  Will be back again for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park

Pants, shirt, and jacket all covered. Then then says ""I guess thats your que to go"" as if it was my fault.  Then asked if I would like a replacement beer. I said that would at least be nice. She comes back with a beer 1/4 filled and walks away without another word. Nothing offered to compensate the fact that I was covered in alcohol that she spilled on me, except for her giving me less beer than what she spilled in the first place.  I have been here at least twice a month for 6 years. I'll never go back. I wish she didnt ruin this restaurant for me. But that was the worse customer service I've ever experienced. If that's how they are trained.

The waitress replied that it was a popular salad but they just decided to change it. The other major menu change is your salad and soup pairing. You can now only pair a tossed salad with soup. Any other salad is considered a full meal portion salad. So I opted new bonsai salad and ordered a cup of french onion soup as a side. The soup came in a small square bowl. The salad was full sized but nothing to give a hoot about. FYI They have not removed the soup and sandwich pairing so I guess I'll have to go that route next time.

Ken L.,"Pittsburgh, PA",4999,933,18953,1.0,8/5/2016,"Only reason for my consideration this time: email from the Red Royalty club for a FREE birthday burger.  I usually avoid RR as they tend to be grossly inconsistent and this location is no exception. Upon arrival, 20 minutes sitting at table.  Asked twice if I could order.  Server arrives and takes my Chophouse burger order which basically is burger with mushrooms.  Added an order of onion rings also.  The burger only took 15 minutes, which was fine.  The burger itself not so great: the buns were soggy and everything had a mushy texture.  The onion rings helped a bit.   Trying to call a server to let him know or anyone for that matter was near impossible.  I finally gave up and walked over to the bar, the bartender had the worst look as though she hated her job with a passion.  Not only did she look that way, she displayed one of the worst disgusted looks I have ever seen as I attempted to ask her the question.  After another 12 minutes, I stopped a another waitress who refused to turn around and acknowledge me as I worked hard to explain to her about the birthday burger.  She said under her breath, ""yeah, I got it"" as she stormed on by.  Another 12 minutes flew by with absolutely no action.  My other half went up to the bar again to ask, this time the male manager and bartender both blew a gasket and berated her for asking again.   Finally, a full 30+ minutes later the server stops by claiming a six top occupied all his time.  Not only that, he was not informed to comp my birthday burger so spent yet another 10 minutes to fix.   Food and Customer Service?  Non-existent with management staff that further perpetuates that culture.  Zero stars - I want my time and money back.    ""Happy B day, Ken, from RR!""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park

Victoria S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",121,178,981,5.0,2/3/2016,"We had a very good lunch experience today. The restaurant was not busy at all and this allowed our server to be attentive and our food to be served rather quick.    We had a rather large lunch. We started with the chips served with guac and salsa. The salsa was on the spicy side, which I'd prefer. The guac was good. Not too bland and not too salty.     We had 4 entrees. The bacon cheese burger, with two pieces of large thick bacon and American cheese. The crispy chx tender salad, served with egg, bacon, cheese and tomato. The salad was a modest size, but tasty. The whiskey river BBQ chx wrap, with lettuce tomato. The whiskey sauce was sweet with a little bit of a pepper taste. It was a big wrap and very yummy. The kids order of corn dog bite was plentiful, with 5 pieces of the dogs and a cup of fruit for our choice of side. The refill of fries was generous.      For desert, we chose two. The mountain high mudd pie was huge! It was a giant piece of ice cream cake with the top layer of chocolate ice cream and a cookie crum middle with the bottom layer of ice cream as cookies and cream. The crust was a chocolate cookie crust. It was topped with a generous amount of whipped cream with a chocolate and caramel drizzle! Yum! The second was the gooey chocolate brownie cake. The cake was topped with a warm chocolate syrup and a side of vanilla ice cream with strawberries supposed to have been on top, but my kid wanted it on the side.      The experience was great. I feel very satisfied with the service and food and my tummy is happy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park
See Dee B.,"Finleyville, PA",2,46,15,1.0,8/21/2016,"Nothing more than lousy bar to drink in while other are shopping since its inside the village mall. Sat down at an empty yet filthy bar. The girl working was very unpleasant. I asked for a drink menu but was told it was ""way outdated"" and many things on it were ""crossed off"".  So I ordered a margarita, which was fine. Face it, how hard is it to put tequila and triple sec in with some cocktail mix.... Then I ordered boneless wings. She asked if I wanted ranch or blue cheese. I said BC please especially if it came with celery. She said she would make sure mine did.  About 15 min later, crusty hard, half cold nuggets of chicken came out. Sucky tasting. No surprise.... And of course, the curdled looking blue cheese was not accompanied with celery. She sure did make sure. The place was slow, no surprise again, and she never even noticed. Frankly she couldn't care a bit. WONT BE BACK!!!! Crap spot, crap service, crap food...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park
Meghan B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",184,475,736,2.0,11/17/2014,"Oh red robin. I just try so hard to like you but I just find you oh so boring.  Story- when my boyfriend and I started dating , red robin was his FAVORITE place to go. If I wanted to treat him, he wanted to come here. I tried tons of items on their menu and just never loved anything. Eventually, he broke away from his red robin obsession and moved onto chilli's (another place I just do not like, lol).  Him and I haven't been to a red robin in over a year- until yesterday. I was so hungry I didn't care where we went, so when he suggested red robin I figured why not? Although my memories of red robin consisted of bland chicken sandwiches and bland fries that are too large and just aren't very good in general- I figured I could find something I enjoyed.  Eh. First off, this location is always busy on the weekends. It's in the mall, so it's usually packed. Especially now that it's holiday season. We came around 3 on a Sunday and it wasn't too busy, which was nice.  I ordered a strawberry lemonade because I remembered they had good ones. Should have looked at the price first.. $5 for sugar water with frozen strawberries.. Why?! It was good don't get me wrong.. But $5? I'll skip it next time.  We ordered queso dip for an appetizer.. Honestly, this was the tastiest item we had. There was chunks of tomatoes and other vegetables and meat in the queso and I just devoured it. And for $5 it wasn't a bad deal.  I ordered the soup and salad combo figuring that there's no way they could mess it up. Eh. The French onion soup was ok- the onions weren't cooked enough though and the cheese that was melted on top was entirely too thick. The broth was decent though. The salad was miniature.. And their croutons just tasted, off. Their balsamic also tasted just odd.  My boyfriend likes their burgers, which is what they are ""famous"" for. I never tried one.  I hope his red robin fix will be satisfied for at least another year. Just another disappointing chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park
Brian J.,"Sparks Glencoe, MD",0,2,,1.0,9/3/2017,This place really went downhill. I use to love their burgers here but now they're below average. The service is pretty awful too. We waited over an hour for a burger when they weren't even busy. Do yourself a favor and go down to BJs down the street for a much better burger and experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park
Chelsea M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",304,744,469,4.0,11/3/2014,"I dont mind Red Robin. I'm a sucker for carbs, so the bottomless fries win me over every time. This visit, I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ Burger- burger, bbq sauce cheddar cheese, crispy onion straws, lettuce, tomatoes & mayo. I found it to be really good. They also had the same choice with a grilled chicken sandwich  Bobby ordered the Prime Chophouse Burger which looked delicious. I can't remember what my sister had for dinner, but she ordered French Onion Soup beforehand. I tried the soup- very good! Sometimes not all French onion soup is tasty!  For drinks, I ordered ""Sand in Your Shorts. It had  Chambord, vodka, Peach Schnapps, Midori, triple sec, o.j., cranberry juice & sweet 'n sour. It was tasty, not very strong though. My sister ordered a frozen strawberry margarita & Bobby ordered Reb Robin's version of a Long Island.. I forget the name :) Next time I'm going to order a Bottomless Root Beer Float. I'm pretty sure those are the most amazing 4 words that a can be next to each other in a sentence.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park
Katherine Z.,"Pittsburgh, PA",54,11,11,5.0,3/14/2017,We love this place for several reason but the number one reason we live it is because the are amazing with our family! Our family is gluten free and our oldest daughter has autism. They are always accommodating with there food selections and go out of their way to provide us information and food that is gluten free. BUT the even better part is that they treat my daughter with complete respect and just like a regular kid. This autism mom couldn't be happier,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park
Annie W.,"Bethel Park, PA",1,12,,1.0,3/4/2017,"We decided to try our local RR since it was close to home and we had a gift card. Glad we didn't have to foot the bill for a sub-par meal. The waitress was attentive and our Onion Ring Tower appetizer arrived as expected...hot and tasty! The burger ordered by my companion was definitely not as tasty as other RR locations in our area. I ordered the Fish and Shrimp Duo...big mistake...it arrived barely warm but the slaw was nice and hot! Obviously the victim of heat lamps used before a meal is picked up.Thankfully the ""Bottomless Fries"" were not offered...ours were limp and soggy! The restaurant appeared old, tired and needing a good cleaning! Sorry RR we won't be visiting this location again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park
