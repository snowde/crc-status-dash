The food is consistently good. There's local beer on tap. Btw, at this location if you hear a Toby Keith song you can buy a beer for a buck!

Lisa R.,"Laurel, MT",18,26,65,2.0,12/5/2017,One of the slowest services I have ever experienced. It took over 25 minutes to receive our order. We arrived for lunch; the dining room was not crowded. When asked why our meals were taking so long our server said that the kitchen had to cook the corn. The image of the corn speaks volumes.  It is amazing it took that long. We hadn't asked for a refund or to speak to the manager. However the manager heard of our unhappiness. Without request or complaint she gave us complimentary cards for an appetizer or dessert. We really like Red Robin's menu.  Perhaps this was an off time. We will try again. We have hopes that service will be quicker next time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-billings
Keith L.,"Billings, MT",0,8,,2.0,12/3/2017,"Food's good, but wear long johns and a parka. Ridiculously cold with ceiling fans at full strength.  Everyone's wearing coats.  ""Corporate dictates the thermostat temps"" BS!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-billings
Todd P.,"Columbus, MT",0,1,1,2.0,9/27/2017,"Worst service ever! Don't expect food fast, been there 2 times and took over a hour each time..and food was mediocre at best..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-billings
Noel H.,"Billings, MT",0,3,,1.0,10/25/2017,"After having lunched at RR for years, today was my last time. Lousy service (I always sit at the bar) and charging $9 for the house chardonay.  Sad.

Jennifer W.,"Billings, MT",0,3,1,2.0,7/12/2017,"I am always willing to give anyone a second chance...but twice in the past month I have had issues with this restaurant!!! First time, my order was incorrect and no bread was provided with my salad...I was also charged a different amount than advertised on the website...I phoned the manager and he said that ""corporate runs the website"" and someone ""should have checked my order""... So I gave them a second chance...once again, no bread provided with my salad and the 2nd salad that I ordered was advertised to have ""black beans, cilantro and lime, as well as a cheesy enchilda""...none of which were on the salad...SOOO...the management OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THEIR REPUTATION!!! Has made NO EFFORT to rectify their issues, therefore DOES NOT deserve me as a customer!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-billings
Xiaoyi W.,"Billings, MT",71,20,91,5.0,3/6/2017,Can always count on Red Robin for a good black and blue burger with my sunny side egg added. Sweet potato fries are amazing~ kids friendly~ balloons at the door make them wanna come back again and again~ now if they can only not pop the balloons inside the car on the way home it would be ideal...but that never happens of course^^,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-billings
Reni B.,"Post Falls, ID",0,56,2,2.0,6/19/2017,"Had to wait ten minutes when there were numerous tables available. One order was messed up, took 15 minutes to get a replacement meal. Everyone else at the table was finished before the other replacement meal arrived. They could have at least brought a side out, but did not. Very little apology.

Nikolas A.,"Missoula, MT",56,7,13,4.0,3/19/2017,Pretty good. Service was good even though it was a busy holiday.

Rachel H.,"Billings, MT",17,47,1,3.0,1/2/2017,"The food is consistently delicious. And the service is consistently poor.

Hannah F.,"Billings, MT",0,28,7,4.0,5/19/2016,"I went to red robin about a month ago and had a horrible experience and yelped about it. I got a comment on my review apologizing and asking for my email address. So I gave it to them and received multiple emails from the company apologizing and offering a gift card for all of my troubles. I had the manager of the Billings store as well as a couple of people out of Missoula apologizing. I am overwhelmed how amazing they were. I got a gift card in the mail and was completely content with that, then got an email saying they have one waiting for me at the restaurant. They knew the people from Missoula had sent me one but still wanted to give me one! How great of them! When I went in the service was fantastic and food was so fresh!! Great job redeeming yourself Red Robin! I'm over the moon about my experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-billings
Meag O.,"Billings, MT",0,17,,1.0,1/11/2016,"My family and I came in on a Sunday evening for dinner and waited several minutes for the two hostesses to figure out which table to put us at in their empty restaurant. Our waitress was very prompt and got the kids their food right away since they were hungry and getting restless. After our food came my husband took one bite of his onion rings and said they were disgusting then took a bite of his burger and found a BONE in the meat! I immediately told the waitress and she apologized and said she'd talk to the manager. The manager, who was apparently too busy to speak with us, waived the meal from our tab. While we appreciated not paying for food we couldn't even eat we did not appreciate the lack of professionalism. In the future, Manager, I'd suggest personally speaking with customers who have disputes instead of sending servers to do your dirty work.  We will never come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-billings
Tim C.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,19,11,2.0,9/6/2014,"By my lonesome, I popped in for a quick dish. I sat at the bar. If service here were an animal, it would be a turtle. It literally took 10+ minutes for said drink slinger to pour me a Guinness. The lady that had came in after I did had a drink and her lunch order placed by the time I got my beer.  I had the BBQ chicken wrap and it was delicious. Fries were good and I like the feel of the new location.  I sat at the bar for an hour+ and it is covered in dirty dishes that have been there from the previous customers.  2 stars for the food and environment, -3 stars for the poor service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-billings
Kayla T.,"East Helena, MT",23,1,,1.0,6/4/2016,"The food was great as always. But our waitress was a joke. She kept disappearing, and didn't come by to check drink levels. When it came time to pay and leave, it took her a half hour to come pick up our cards. Her name is Joslyn by the way. And overall service at this location needs a major overhaul. Hostess was a crab and apparently doesn't understand that she/he is the first person you meet at a restaurant, and is pretty much required to smile and be friendly. I wouldn't go back to this Red Robin if it was the last place left to eat in Billings. Nothing against the food or the back of the house staff props to you guys.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-billings
Nerissa S.,"Great Falls, MT",0,12,5,5.0,3/15/2017,"As far as family friendly sit down restaurants go in Billings this place is fantastic. They are usually super busy on the weekends so prepare yourself for a little bit of a wait for a table. For a decent quality burger this is my kids favorite place to go. We have had excellent servers, two stand out in particular- Brian and Kyla. We celebrated our four year olds birthday here and Kyla was more than happy to arrange having happy birthday sung to her. Overall a great place to grab a bite and their prices are beyond fair for the quality of food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-billings
Moe P.,"Basin, WY",0,13,,2.0,12/27/2016,"This restaurant has gone down hill since moving to this new space. The management is absolutely horrible. Wait staff makes you feel like thier either in a hurry to get you out or don't check on you.  The food has gone down.... I loved eating there when we came up from WY,  but lately it's been dry, overdone and just gross. Even my kids were not impressed this last time. Will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-billings
Taylor B.,"Billings, MT",0,1,,2.0,2/28/2016,"Don't bother unless you have an hour or more to wait for your food to come out! The good thing is, you rarely have to pay full price since they end up taking a percentage off the bill because of their poor management. Otherwise good food and atmosphere but management needs to fix their kitchen issues!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-billings
Ann M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,31,,2.0,1/26/2016,"Ordered a kids hamburger for my six year old daughter. She didn't eat but maybe two bites and told the server it was ""too hard"" (meaning overcooked) Our server said she would take it back and show the kitchen. I mistakenly assumed she would bring us a new kids burger. Instead, it was taken off our check. That's all well and good, but my daughter left without eating a meal and I had to feed her at home, which defeats the purpose of going out to dinner!  My husband asked for Cheddar cheese on his burger and it came with American cheese. For an $11 hamburger, I think you should be able to get the cheese the way you want it.   Overall, I'm less than impressed with this Red Robin. I know we will not be coming back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-billings
Brayden W.,"Cody, WY",1,4,5,3.0,6/16/2015,Food was great but it took 15 minutes for us to get a seat for two people and a baby. There were open tables but they hadn't been bussed yet.

Brandi F.,"Billings, MT",0,11,1,3.0,7/10/2015,"My family and I are very divided on our review. We Love Red Robin food! We have eaten multiple kinds of burgers and all wonderful as well as fries and onion rings. We always encounter a terrible wait when we go. The frustration is that there are open tables throughout but no one is getting sat at them.The new location also does not allow children to sit in the bar area, so this limits seating for families. The new waiting area is extremely small and is not adequate for the amount of people that are waiting.

Ms W.,"Seattle, WA",3,54,,5.0,6/3/2011,"Went there last Friday specifically for fish n chips on a good tip from my friend who said this was the only place in town to get them.  So we went early like 11:30 am was seated right away to be honest I didnt even look at the menu and just ordered what I have been seeking in this town now for 2 yrs. some good fish n chips! They came fast enough and generous portion well being that they are 11.99 which is high for that but I have been craving them! The fish was great and the batter they were fried in was great for not getting to go to spuds in Seattle, the only qualm I had was wished the fries were hot they were warm and thats the only peeve I had can't say anything bout the waitress she was nice don't know what the other items taste like but can't go wrong with the f n c's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-billings?start=20

Wendy D.,"Casper, WY",15,89,,2.0,8/8/2010,I haven't been to a Red Robins in a long time since we livedon the East Coast.  It just wasn't like i remebered it.  The burgers were okay nothing special.  The service was very slow.  We got seated right away and there was no wait there were tables open and it still took an hour to get our burgers.  We did not order appetitzers or anything just the burgers.  We drank like 3 rounds of pop before the food showed up and had to wait for that.  Will not  bother going to a red robins again.. Oh yeah did I mention that for 7 people eating burgers and only having pop the bil and tip were like $100.  I have better places to go for that money!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-billings?start=40
Kim S.,"Denver, CO",132,23,,3.0,9/26/2010,"My friend chose this place, not me.  I have eaten at Red Robin in Denver a few times and find it awful.  I really don't care for chains, but some of my friends just love this place.  They tease me, saying I am a food snob.  I don't know what to call it, but I avoid chain restaurants as much as possible. So I met my friend- on time, with a smile on my face.  This particular friend has no idea this is the LAST place I would have chosen, especially since I am in Billings for such a short time. We were seated right away, unlike the CO Red Robin restaurants.  The server got our order and brought the drinks and food in a reasonable amount of time.  Of course I ordered one of the gazillion burgers they have on the menu... after struggling with which one, I asked the server which one I should get. I went with her suggestion.  She made a good choice for me.  Here is why I give this a third star:  The bun was totally different from the buns in CO.  I thought these mega-chains had to get their food from the same place, make it the same way, no exceptions.  This bun didn't fall apart, kept ""in place"" as I ate the huge burger; and the place wasn't jam packed with people in a hurry.  Ahhh, Montana.  I love you so. Wasn't the greatest burger on earth, or even close, but waaaayyy better than the other Red Robins I've been to in the past.  I also thought it was so cute when one of the staff brought a balloon for a cute-as-a-bug kid in the other booth.  They even asked him what color of balloon he wanted.  He said green.  I thought it was a great choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-billings?start=40
