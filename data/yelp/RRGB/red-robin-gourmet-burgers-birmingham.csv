Jennifer M.,"Trussville, AL",20,11,,4.0,11/27/2015,"The burgers have recently received a makeover, but my interest here is in the poutine. This is the closest place to my house where I can get this most blessed of Canadian dishes, and it's actually Good! My only gripe is that, while the burgers are good, for the price I pay for a Red Robin burger, I could be eating a national award winning hand crafted burger that was ground fresh in house that day. I know I could, because THAT restaurant is just a hop away in Birmingham.  Service was a little slow, but it wasn't unacceptable. I think if it had been more crowded it might have been rough. Be mindful of the table tablets. Ordering games DOES cost extra, and it's easy for kids to grab and order if your head is turned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-birmingham?start=20
Sheila M.,"Birmingham, AL",84,13,3,1.0,3/14/2016,"This was the second time recently I went to this place and both times the service was not good. First time was on a holiday and they were super packed and while we had a waiter who came by, we could not hear him (talked too softly even when asked to speak up) and he managed to get almost everything wrong on the order, repeatedly.  Second time, today, there was one waiter for entire restaurant (lunch time) and he had only four tables with customers. Even though I asked, I ended up getting up and getting my own silverware, and my own napkins twice. Food was OK, but onion rings had no flavor except that of the grease and there was no salt other than big clunky sea salt grinder that was too hard for me to turn.  Also, the meat was not cooked well done as ordered, but rather was more medium well. It seems well cooked means ""done all the way"" to me. We'd moved seats three times trying to find one that was not right  under the loud music and not under the freezing cold A/C or by a yakity child. The manager saw us and did stop by our table several times. I guess he realized we were starting off not too thrilled. He did turn down the music. I'm not impressed and don't think I'll go back (at least this location) unless I'm in a group that chooses the place and I have no other choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-birmingham?start=20
Joshua S.,"Trussville, AL",62,106,614,4.0,2/3/2015,"The food is good, prices excessive, and service top notch. I have probably visited this location on about five occasions. I visited most recently on Friday 1/30/2015. My guests ordered the crispy chicken salad, and a bacon cheeseburger. They were pretty pleased with the quality of food that they received. I ordered the seafood platter. I always order a burger, but decided to mix it up a bit. It was decent.  Our bill was $47.67. Soda: 2.79 x 2. Sweet tea: $2.79. Bacon cheese burger: $9.99. Crispy chicken salad $10.49. Seafood scatter: $14.49. These prices aren't outrageous by any means. However, they are more than I would expect as a consumer. Five Guys Burgers and fries is notorious for being high priced, but high quality. They also don't have table service. I could see myself spending less than $47.67 for a total of 3 guests at Five Guys, and receive a similar, good quality, dining experience. To Red Robin's credit, fries are bottomless which is a significant advantage for those looking for quantity. The service was fabulous. Even the hostess working on Friday night was great. The entrance was totaled packed with people waiting, and she was so helpful. Our servers name was John. This was our first time going out with a newborn and were somewhat nervous about seating etc. he was careful to ensure that our seating arrangement was to our comfort. He refilled drinks frequently, made small talk, and was patient with our order. We even discussed how impressive the bus boy was. Seriously, the staff at Red Robin is pretty great.  I give Red Robin in Trussville four stars. In full disclosure, they did offer a free meal on Veterans Day which is pretty awesome. The food is good, prices slightly excessive, and service amazing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-birmingham?start=20
LM F.,"Virginia Beach, VA",65,60,145,4.0,1/23/2015,"So, we went back January 17 to celebrate my husband's birthday. It wasn't our first choice, but when you go into Red Lobster in Trussville and see an 84 rating, you're probably wondering if their fishing in a cesspool for their fishies. The first guy who greeted us at Red Robin in Trussville SUCKED. I don't know if he was ""manstruating"" or just a card-carrying jerk. He sat me and my family in the middle of traffic, where servers kept bumping into my bag (hanging on my chair). I asked if we can be moved. He said I would have to wait because ""his"" servers were too busy with parties. We then asked the ACTUAL manager, Bob, who cheerfully accommodated us. *Cue the Heavenly harps.* Then, just because the ""Everything is Awesome Angel"" smiled upon us, we got the best server EVER! She was sweet, professional, and rocked it. Though, I'm embarrassed to say her name escaped me. (Look for brown hair, tall, glasses, slender, sweet server) Now, my rule is: you can get away with a little bit of suckiness if you're excellent with my kiddos. This woman deserved a gold star. We also told Bob. Bob was cool. We like Bob. We loved server woman. So, I'm updating this. The food was still mediocre, but if you get an upgrade for the excellent service alone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-birmingham?start=20

Actually beats 2014 too.  Bottomless fries and shake would have been good if server ever came back to check on us.   He changed our order too by saying did you want baby burger or regular. So we said no baby!  And got charged $3 additional each... Mgr did fix this.  Slow to non existent service, no water refills, had to ask several times to get him to talk to us..

Today we were seated at a super tiny table even though we had a baby in s high chair, thankfully we were moved. We were seat and NEVER got straws (asked more than once) we didn't get silverware until at least 30 min after being there and asking twice, had to use my fingers for my child's food. We ordered meatball kids meal (didn't receive all her meatballs but they eventually came) a burger which tasted fine, fish, that tasted like the oil was old, and the baked broccoli was just unappealing. The ""bottomless"" fries and fruit cup, were DEFINITELY NOT bottomless, we didn't get another serving (of aproxx 11 fries) until we were ready for our check, the same goes with the fruit cup. The waiter was very friendly but seemed to be a very absent minded.

Michael B.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",1,19,,1.0,11/27/2015,"Red Robin rolled out new table top kiosks to order food/drinks and pay the check. We were charged $1.99 'entertainment fee' (whatever that was for) related to this device. The service was bad, food took long to arrive the server wasn't attentive at all. Then, we had to ask the server twice to have his manager take the $1.99 off the check. With kids this kiosk (basically a tablet-style device) is a great source of trouble, as it attracts their attention.

Kristopher K.,"Anchorage, AK",0,2,,1.0,8/19/2015,Sitting here now on my 50th minute waiting for a water.  I about slipped and hit my face on a table because of the dangerously slick floor.  The service is by far the worst I have ever experienced.  The staff is under trained and could care less about their patrons.  It's a shame that I am here with a group otherwise I would leave immediately.  DO NOT EAT AT THIS TERRIBLE CHAIN.  This is my first experience and I promise you this will be my last.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-birmingham?start=20
Sabrina L.,"Birmingham, AL",0,3,,1.0,8/22/2015,"First visit review:  ""In Theory, Great!  In Practice, Nah."" Upon arrival, I noted the restaurant was uncomfortably cold, and I overheard diners complaining to their servers about the temperature. Our server, Jordan, was fast, personable, and attentive. We ordered a strawberry shake and a lemonade.  The strawberry shake was good.  There was an insect in the glass of lemonade, which we traded out for a different drink.  However, we understand that in the food and beverage business, this can happen.   The menu descriptions sounded fantastic.  I observed the high prices but thought, If the food is good, it's worth paying a little more. I ordered a bacon avocado burger.  My guest ordered the steak burger.  A few bites in, my companion said what we both were thinking:  ""Hey.  I thought the food would be better than this."" Avocado, bacon, mayo, red onion, Swiss cheese, char-grilled beef.  I should have been hit with layers of flavor.  However, I don't think Red Robin uses fresh, quality ingredients.  As a matter of fact, in my opinion, if I gave my burger to Stevie Wonder to eat, he would not be able to identify what he was tasting.  There was NO beef flavor in the burger.  I had to pull the bun back to visually confirm the presence of avocado and mayo. Bottomless fries:  an exciting concept, except the fries were extremely salty and had no potato flavor.  My friend's fries were left unfinished for the most part.  There was no desire to take advantage of the opportunity to enjoy the ""bottomless"" part of the french fries. The coating on the onion rings was too salty.  However, the onion inside was sweet and tasty. $40 including tip.  This is more expensive than Johnny Rockets.   VERDICT:  I'm glad to say that I've been to Red Robin, but I would not go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-birmingham?start=20

Whitney B.,"Little Rock, AR",488,360,343,3.0,3/7/2013,"Ok, this is like a once in a year dinner outing. I occasionally went to RR in California, usually when I was visiting small cities and it was one of few options.  But after this last visit, I am starting to think it is just not worth it.  3 of us went. We all got a burger. We shared an appetizer. We each had a drink, one of us had two.  But to spend almost 100 bucks, was just astounding. Never in my life have I had to pay so much money when my main course was a burger.  But the food was what I expected. Average, yet not disappointing. It is a good place for vegetarians, because you can get any sandwich style with either a boca patty or their own veggie patty.

Jeff S.,"Gadsden, AL",14,74,132,3.0,5/21/2013,"I would like to start this review out by saying that at one time I was a big fan of red robin, eating at this franchise every time I went to Huntsville or Trussville, but as of lately.. Red Robin's quality seems to have dropped over the past few years that I have been eating here.  I consider their burgers now ""overpriced"" for what you get and even down to the Jalapeno Coins which I love, and still do.. At the Trussville Red Robin you have to order them in a set of two appetizers, at one time you could order them separate.  What's up with that?  They offer quiet a few of their appetizers on a single order basis but not one of the best food items on their menu.. Talk about greedy..  My total after the burger, two appetizers and tip was $23.00.. What a shame..   As for the burger, I had the ""Bonzai"".  This burger had a teriyaki sauce and pineapple on it, similar to a Hawaiian burger from other restaurants.  I got it all the way and cooked medium-well.  The burger came out what seemed like only a couple of minutes after the appetizers came out and was very thick, mostly with lettuce.  I should have ordered it without the lettuce or mayo because they killed it.  The taste of the mayo/lettuce combo completely overpowered the sweetness of the rest of the burger, but I guess that wasn't really their fault since I ordered it that way.. Lesson learned.   My server was pretty good, but sparse in his visits.  Another waitress brought me a refill on my drink and I asked her if I could get a carryout box to carry home what was left of me two appetizers.  She said yes and disappeared, a few minutes later I noticed her standing around a table of coworkers talking to them.  So I hunted down my waiter and asked him, I believe she overheard me and said that she would..  And she did that time..  No real complaints.. although this was around 4 pm on a Monday.. and I was one of less than 5 tables for the whole restaurant.  I am not exaggerating on that.. As far as the bathrooms go, they were clean.. If anyone is interested..    I am knocking 1 star for the lack of service/having to hunt down my server on a dead day and 1 star for the drop in quality/having to order two appetizers to get the one that I wanted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-birmingham?start=20
Mary O.,"Talladega, AL",0,18,2,2.0,2/1/2015,First visit and the best thing was our server.  Was not impressed with the burgers at all and especially the prices. We asked for extra cheese on my grandson's which did not happen. The pepper ketchup was barely visible on my burger so therefore little taste.

Eric S.,"Arabi, LA",29,173,74,3.0,10/1/2014,"The slippery floor pretty much knocked this place from great to just ok. My wife and i were passing threw and decided to stop here. They don't have Red Robin's in my area so we have always wanted to try them out. When walking in the floor was super slippery, the hostess blamed the A/C. I hope nobody slips and falls, that's a big lawsuit waiting to happen. The waitress was friendly and very helpful with deciding what to get. We both got burger combos, i had something with onion rings on it, that was really good, wife had a burger with nearly everything on it. Food came out fast, but the Fries tasted old and not hot. Both burgers were very good. What knocked the rating down for me was when we trying to leave i had to get a towel to be able to stand up since the floors were super slippery. After complaining about it, they brushed it off as ""yea that happens"" and we left walking slowly like penguins so we wouldn't slip.

Gene B.,"Birmingham, AL",5,76,14,2.0,1/13/2018,"How the mighty have fallen. Red Robin used to be one of our favorite restaurants. Decent food, decent service and fair prices. That's no longer the case.  My wife, who used to suggest RR at least monthly, now refuses to eat there after multiple bad experiences. My young daughter, who is more forgiving, asked to eat there last night for our monthly Daddy Daughter Date Night. So we went. It took a few extra minutes to get seated because the purple haired hostess was too busy chatting with her co-worker/friend to be bothered with actually doing her job, but who am I to complain? Once we were seated, our rather insistent waitress came over and took our drink order, and tried to talk me out of my favorite drink in lieu of her own favorite. No thanks! When we went to order our meals, it was a similar experience. My daughter ordered the Hawaiian burger, and I ordered the Cobb salad, and asked for it to be chopped and tossed with Ranch dressing. The waitress responded with a quizzical look, and said ""you really want it chopped and tossed with the dressing?"" As if that was some sort of abnormal and unreasonable request of the kitchen staff.  When I confirmed that that was in fact what I wanted, she walked away shaking her head saying ""ohhhkaaay!!"" like I was some kind of mutant. When the food arrived, the order was correct, but my daughter's hamburger looked like someone had sat on it and placed it under a heat lamp for 20 minutes. It was dripping grease and completely unappetizing. The fries she got were cold as well.  Our waitress did a good job of keeping the drinks full, which is one of my pet peeves, so that's a positive. At the end of the meal, the waitress came over when she saw me using the table iPad thing to pay the check, and made it a point to tell me that she would ""get in trouble"" if I gave her anything less than the highest ratings in the survey that followed paying the bill. She then stood over me watching while I filled out the survey. It doesn't get more annoying than that.  The only reason this RR got a second star is because my daughter and I did have a good time playing games together at the table, even if the food and the service were less than acceptable.  I won't be back if I can help it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-birmingham

Lauren P.,"Deer Park, TX",2,29,4,1.0,9/12/2016,"This is the worst location my family and I have been to. Unfortunately, it's the closest one to us and we have decided to stop giving this restaurant a chance. We've been there 4 times altogether. The 1st 2 times the food was good, our servers have always been great, and service times were pretty decent as food coming out. But the managers are awful and it always smells like mildew and all of the seats are damaged. But hey, the burgers are good. These last 2 times...AWFUL One night I took my sons out for dinner. It was busy. No big deal. We were sat at a table that had clearly been wiped with a rancid rag. I sat for about 6 mins with the menus up as the manager stared at me and through me. Finally our busy waitress came to greet us and recleaned it. But the smell wouldn't go away and came back about 10 mins later. They were under staffed and the server was stretched thin. But we understood. She got out drinks out and food order in, but we didn't see her after. What was disappointing was that the manager never checked on us when we clearly needed refills even before the food came out, we needed silverware,  we needed help period. Other servers just smiled and never stopped when I waved. Our poor server had to take on 2 big parties on top of her section and the manager didn't step up to help her. She just stood and PRETENDED to swipe on a tablet. She didn't even really look at it! We went without drinks through our meal and our server looked so distraught when she came towards the end to aplogize for her absence and then seemed irritated that no one stepped up to help us. I spoke with the manager and she seemed irritated that I complained. I told her everything I noticed, never once asked for anything free, i just thought it should be brought up. She Compd our food and that was nice, but that wasn't my intention. I still took care of the server because he black of support wasn't her fault. She was great. We just left and told the SAME FEMALE MANAGER we are not coming back. We were walked into the dining room that smelled WORSE than usual. Extra mildew carpet and it was hot in there. I asked if we could.move to the cocktail area where the smell was nonexistent. But due to age limits, I couldn't take my son in there. She didn't seem to care that it smelled worse and another table even agreed with me!!!  This place is a wreck, smells, damaged and dirty atmosphere... never had experiences like this at any other Red Robin. Maybe a change needs to be considered? Management change? The GM never comes out when asked either. He stays in the back. I've only asked once but have seen other tables shut down. The server staff has always been great.

Mahmoud A.,"Montgomery, AL",16,3,20,1.0,7/16/2016,"I always eat at Red Robin I love it, but I'm not sure what this is, the food is nasty it doesn't even taste the same not even close, I've been to bad ones but this the worst, if you never ate at red Robin before DO NOT GO THERE you'll never think about even considering another red Robin, it's a shame how terrible this restaurant is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-birmingham

Krystle M.,"Carrollton, GA",8,1,8,1.0,7/23/2016,"The burgers were very disappointing, nothing like the Red Robins in Georgia. The meat had very little flavour and the bun was a plain sesame seed McDonald's type bun. Also not a fan of seeing a roach crawling up the wall while I'm eating. I will not be back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-birmingham
Sean B.,"Pinson, AL",76,22,,3.0,2/28/2016,"Service was pretty decent but the food was slow moving and average. Pretzel bites were over cooked and the cheese was obviously microwaved. My ""big ghost"" certainly wasn't big and while I said no fresh jalapeños, it had none at all. Matt's smoke and pepper burger was tasty and quite sizable but not worth $13.50.  All in all it was ok!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-birmingham
Brandi P.,"Amory, MS",16,6,5,1.0,6/5/2016,Terrible slow service! Burgers tastes like frozen patties. Floors are slippery and bathrooms are nasty. It has been this way the last few times.

Drew H.,"Anchorage, AK",27,3,,1.0,2/23/2014,"Food still tastes good, but we won't go back for several reasons... The changes in the menu and portion size all lead to one conclusion... Profit has become more important than a great burger. Milk shakes are excellent, but you no longer get the tin for a free refill (you can pay more if you want it). My guacamole burger had almost no guacamole on it. The fries now come in a small container that gives you fewer fries and no one offers more (are they still bottomless???). The burgers also seem smaller than were in the past. The final straw (or the first if you look at sequentially) is they sat my family and me in the bar area with sports tv on full blast and never asked if that was ok. It was our daughters birthday and they never did their song spiel, which we love because it's embarrassing. We couldn't hear each other talk and over all this was a terrible overpriced experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-birmingham?start=40
Wine D.,"Mountain Brook, AL",0,3,,1.0,1/30/2015,"If I were the owner of the Trussville Red Robin, I would fire any and all managers. It is obvious this place has poor leadership and the staff are poorly trained.  We have been to this restaurant three times and each time we were floored with the poor service, lack of attention to orders and no leadership. Our last and final visit left my whole family of seven baffled as to how this place is able to stay open. It started with waiting at the front for the hostess who was preoccupied with talking to the bartender and texting on her phone. She made her way towards us only to tell us someone will be with you in a moment. After 10 minutes, she returned to seat us at one of larger corner booths. The booth still had spilled food and drink from the previous patrons. She said someone would clean the table shortly. We just stood until a guy came and wiped the table off quickly only to sweep all the crumbs off into the seats. We sat down and found the table sticky and grimy. When the waiter arrived, we asked why the table felt greasy and he said it was just the finish on the table. Eh? We placed seven orders and 3 out of 7 were wrong. Two of the burgers were still reddish pink in the middle and the other order had the wrong bread. Communicating this to the waiter, he took the three orders back and returned correcting the bread issue but the burgers were still uncooked. We asked for the manager yet we got another waiter trying to help the situation. The second waiter was able to help rectify the uncooked burger situation however the rest of the family's food got cold waiting on the others. We then had to ask for silverware only to have the waiter return with wet silverware he claimed was wet because they just came out of the dishwasher. We asked for silverware that was clean, dry and not touched by his hands. A different waiter returned with a handful of silverware in a napkin laying it on the table. We should have already left but we kept giving them a chance. My wife was upset, the kids uninterested in their cold burgers and were ready to go. We left the food on the table and left the restaurant without paying. I'd be interested in what they scored with the health department.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-birmingham?start=40
Lydia C.,"Alabaster, AL",0,14,1,2.0,11/26/2013,"Wow....I lived in the Pacific Northwest for a number of years and Red Robin was the ""place"" to go for a good burger.  Unfortunately the Trussville location does not capture that reputation.  The service was horrible, the burger was not fresh cooked, but pre-cooked and placed on the grill for reheating.   Sadly, after being a Red Robin fan in Seattle, I can't recommend this place.  Come on guys....Red Robin rocks out west....don't taint the brand!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-birmingham?start=40
Lori J.,"Birmingham, AL",0,7,1,3.0,10/27/2013,"Great food, great wait staff. The only thing that stops me from going back is the service I received from the bar.

Pat P.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",11,51,1,1.0,5/31/2011,"This is the second time we've eaten at the Birmingham Red Robin, and we've not been impressed either visit. We brought our 6 yo grandson, and the first thing he noticed was the TV in the floor wasn't working. No one greeted us at the door. We had to flag someone down to find the hostess. She was sitting at a table with a handful of friends/employees. Our appetizer came out 2 minutes before our burgers. The appetizer was cold. Our burger order was wrong. It was difficult to flag down our server, even though the place was fairly empty. But the icing on this cake was the condition of the mens bathroom. When my husband has to clean a toilet before he'll use it, it must be pretty bad. The stall doors were broken, and the bathroom was a mess.  We've always enjoyed the Red Robin's in Montgomery, Al and in Greensboro, NC. We will not be back to the one in Birmingham.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-birmingham?start=40

Daniel H.,"Leeds, AL",4,10,8,5.0,3/13/2013,"I've never had a bad experience at this place. I don't know if the previous reviews are old or what, but every time I've eaten here the people were friendly, food was good and hot, order accuracy was perfect, my drink never allowed to reach empty, my fries were constantly refilled (endless fries), restrooms were clean, and the burgers were great. The previous tip to go across the street to five guys burgers and fries I wouldn't recommend, well unless you don't mind shelling out $50 for two burgers, fries, and drinks. The burgers were so good on my first visit that I came back on my birthday with my family, and had a great time. Oh yeah and one last thing...

Keith C.,"Birmingham, AL",97,161,664,4.0,9/24/2009,"If you're in the mood for a good burger, and don't mind feeling a little bit like you're in a circus (the place is moderately geared towards kids and families), Red Robin's not a bad place to try.  The burgers are generally pretty good, and they even have other offerings like chicken burgers, onion rings & cheese sticks (both are fantastic), and very flamboyant drinks (i.e., fruity-mixed drinks - alcoholic and non, if that's your thing; I've had a couple of the latter and they were tasty).  The wait staff is fairly young (teens), and extremely amicable and attentive to their customers.  I've visited Red Robin on more than a single occasion and leave pretty satisfied each time I return.  It's therefore well worth 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-birmingham?start=40
JD W.,"Pinson, AL",0,11,,2.0,10/5/2013,"Let me start with the good: Red Robin serves tasty food. Unfortunately the Birmingham Red Robin has terrible, terrible service. The last time we went our server went home without handing off our order, leaving us with an hour wait before we got our food. Today we went after lunch hoping for a different experience, only to have two servers who couldn't manage between them to deliver drink refills and complete our orders. One asked if we wanted anything, then spent the rest of our visit at the bar playing with the computer without bothering to return with any of the things we asked for. Meanwhile we watched as the greeters couldn't decide if there needed to be two of them at the front or none, people would wait for five minutes to be seated in the mostly empty restaurant while staff walked right past them or we'd watch as one of the girls earned her paycheck opening the door for customers. The kitchen is fine, but there needs to be a serious house cleaning and/or training episode for the floor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-birmingham?start=40
