Dawn S.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,11,5,3.0,11/26/2017,"We were a group of 12 staying at the Hilton 2Home next door and decided to go sit down rather than order in. I'm not sure if all Red Robin's are this way or if it's just this one but there are minimal seating options for a party our size. In fact we only saw 2 areas that could accommodate parties bigger than 6 or 8. We were told it would be 30 minute wait so we chose to stay but it turned in to a 60+ minute wait. The wait might not have been so frustrating if we would have been provided periodic updates or even offered to split up our group but that didn't happen and we saw group after group get seated while we waited. After the 3rd or 4th time of us asking, it was finally explained to us that they only had 1 place they could seat us and it was currently occupied by another group. When we finally were seated, we did have a great waiter (I don't remember his name) who did a great job lightening the mood of our hangry table. The food did take a while to get to us but when it did, it was good. The bottomless fries kept coming and the portion sizes were decent.  Would I try Red Robin again? Yes but not with a large party.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bloomington-2
Linda P.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,6,,1.0,1/3/2018,We had dinner there Tues night the 2nd of Jan.  The waitstaff  appeared to be anything but happy to be there.  Had to wait to be seated and there was no one there.  Sat and waited a goodly time before I caught someones eye and finally we were served.  I ordered the Taco Double Burger and was hoping it would look somewhat like the pic on the menu.  Nope.  Not at all.  There was supposed to be guac and little taco chip pieces.  There was probably a tsp or less of guac and 5 little pieces of taco chip.  1 thin slice of tomato. The meat was double...paper thin and grey.  My husbands burger looked as sickly as mine.  I have had fantastic burgers at this location before but it seems the quality and customer service is going down the toilet.  We may find another location but I`m not even sure I will ever go back to Robin.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bloomington-2
Savannah C.,"Minneapolis, MN",186,125,910,1.0,5/21/2017,"My second time at a Red Robin. Not yummmmm! They've got good fries going for them, but when service is lacking, not even bottomless fries can counteract a negative experience. The food? The burger was just okay. It seemed as if ingredients were just slopped on without much regard to what was being made. Our dipping sauce was sent out with some sort of reddish substance in it. It's as if they make it a habit of serving items without inspection. When we flagged down the waitress to notify her of this issue, she asked twice if we had dipped it in the BBQ and then into the garlic aioli. Both times we answered no. Hold up! What?! What the fudge?! For serious! What reason do we have to lie about sauce? She didn't say it upfront, but we knew that she thought we had dipped our fries in BBQ, then the aioli. She simply didn't want to go and get another cup of aioli. It was insane!  Anyway, don't come here. If you must come here, come when it's dead. Maybe you can get better service then. Don't want to overwork the servers by asking for some dipping sauce that isn't tainted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bloomington-2
Jack G.,"Saint Paul, MN",38,88,63,3.0,5/24/2017,Stopped by for dinner here tonight - plenty of parking out front although this is shared with other businesses. If parking out front is not available then there is basement parking.  I will start with the bad first - food service was quite slow. I was eating with two others who's food came a good 15/20 minutes before mine. I also ordered a second beer which after waiting for another 15/20 minutes our server came up to us and said that he had totally forgotten I asked for another.  The good - food tasted great. I ordered the gourmet cheese burger with Swiss cheese. This really was great and I would definitely order again. The fries were also bottomless and the beer selection was good (including some great local brews). Our server although slow was very nice. I think he looked like he needed some other staff to help out as he was very busy.  If they can sort out the few issues with their service then this would be a really great place to eat and I will probably be back here at some point.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bloomington-2

Annie S.,"Minneapolis, MN",26,119,18,4.0,6/6/2017,"Completely different experience for lunch today. My server Cooper was on point. He's obviously a seasoned vet of the service industry, and this store is very fortunate to have him. He was genuinely kind, and an adept multitasker - acting as both host as well as caring for his tables. Dare I say he behaved as though he likes his job. That's a real treat as a customer - for me anyway. This would be a 5 star review but I was again slightly underwhelmed by the food. It was perfectly acceptable, but it didn't blow me away. The twin cities is a burger haven - there are much better burgers to be had very near by. But I'll take okay food and amazing service any day over the reverse.

Your at work to make money and you can't make tips if you have empty tables. Also within 5 minutes there was 4 people sitting at the host station. You could also see empty tables too.

Chris C.,"Cottage Grove, MN",78,175,738,4.0,12/15/2016,"I love French fries and Red Robin is a French fry lovers dream. They have all you can eat French fries. The only thing better would be a French fry buffet. Can you imagine that? French fry buffet. OMG I need to register my Patent. The first time I visited a Red Robin was about a year ago in Colorado. My uncle, grandpa, dad, three brothers and myself went out to lunch while the ladies were doing some shopping. My uncle ordered a bunch of appetizers ahead of our burgers. We had nachos, onion rings, wings and one tray that arrived in the blizzard of appetizers that none of us recognized. Knowing that we were in Colorado and that Colorado is not only partially famous for their fried Rocky Mountain Oysters (we're going to keep this PG as its a food review) they were also on the menu. So while this group of cowardly men stared at this platter and dared someone to try this mysterious fried item, none of us had the ""kahunas"" to go for it. Thankfully our server arrived and acknowledged that they had brought out a plate of fried mushrooms to the wrong table and that they would be complimentary. I don't recall a plate of anything being eaten that quickly especially after the coast was clear. Anyhow this is where I had my first Whiskey River BBQ Burger. It was really good. The burger comes with cheddar cheese, fried and sautéed onions, shredded lettuce, tomato and mayo along with their BBQ sauce. What's not to like! I've also had the Red Robin Cheeseburger which is also good but in my opinion second to the Whiskey River.  Don't forget those fries.  We were seated right away and before our server arrived another employee who was carrying a serving tray of fries stopped and asked if we would like a bucket of fries. I was in love. So what do you do for a living? ""I walk around and hand out baskets of free fries"". I so need to change jobs. So while we were working on our first basket our server arrived to take our order. Both my wife enjoy the same burger so we didn't have to look at their menu. We were also celebrating my wife's birthday so she get's her burger for free. After our order was placed our kind server brought out another basket of hot fries. That's basket number 2 for those of your scoring at home. The thing I really like about their fries is their Red Robin seasoning. It's a salty and savory blend that really is good on their fries. It's so good we bought a jar to take home with us. And for $5.00 its a steal. Our burgers arrived with number 3 and we were more than ready. I've had burgers at a lot of different places and this is a darn good burger. As we were wrapping up our server asked if there was anything else she could get us. Even though I had fries in my mouth and in my hand, I contemplated going for 4 but I felt that familiar kick to my shin that reminded me that we were full. Red Robin does have a full menu besides fries and burgers as well as a full bar. Don't forget to sign up for their birthday club as if there is anything better than a burger, its a free burger, and fries!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bloomington-2
Chris M.,"Minneapolis, MN",47,220,7,3.0,10/17/2016,Very busy location!   Staff was friendly and burgers were prepared as ordered.  Endless fries or Salad. Relatively new when we went -so forgiving on the confusion over who had our table. Three people. Total bill was $68.    Interesting that the server schedules are based on the reviews.  Seams like a fair system to ensure the best servers get hours they like.  A cool system.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bloomington-2
Sarah A.,"Minneapolis, MN",767,111,386,3.0,3/6/2016,"You better be craving a burger if you come here - and I'll tell you why! First let's start with the drinks: they're all good and very fruity. They also come in cool shaped cups. For example I world never expect a margarita or Long Island to be poured into a weirdly curved cup, but hey it still tasted pretty good.  If you sign up to be a red robin rewards member, they will send you an email when it's your birthday month, and you can get a free burger (excluding the ""finest"" burgers). Did I mention BOTTOMLESS FRIES? Come hungry!! Don't get the herb garlic fries, they might be the cheapest but it came out greasy and tasted like a think cut French fry. Instead, try the sweet potato fries! I had a chicken whiskey burger which had fried onions, lettuce shreds (why not a real lettuce piece) cheese and  tomatoes. It was also topped with some delicious sauce but bout enough of it.  These burgers are all very messy. Although they toasted my burger buns, they were easily soggy so I skipped the buns and just ate the rest of the burger.

Jose R.,"Yorkville, IL",2,5,3,1.0,8/1/2017,"Have to say that this was not a good dining experience for our family. The soups take a very long time to come out and so did our main courses. The kids had had oranges with their meals, and the little cup only contained about 3/4 slices. So we asked for me. We ordered more fries and the person that brought them over, just placed the basket in front our 3 year old and walked away without any communication. Refills were slow, reactive. We had to ask everyone. Just wasn't a pleasant experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bloomington-2

Logan S.,"Mason City, IA",5,7,,1.0,8/1/2017,"I usually love Red Robin's, but this one is seriously lacking in taste and service. Had several issues that would have been minor in themselves, but all added up and were not mitigated effectively. Like a server poring ranch dressing all over me, and then just saying sorry and walking away without offering extra napkins or even getting our table silverware (something that should have been a standard question). Told the manager our concerns when he made his rounds, and he said sorry... and then told us to have a good night. I'm not looking for free food, I'm prepared to pay for meals, but he could have showed any type of concern or empathy. On top of that, the food was seriously lacking in taste and quantity. Tiniest portions I've seen at any Red Robin. Overall, not the worse experience I've had at a restaurant, but I certainly won't go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bloomington-2

I removed the portion of my bun and could actually see pink on the outside of the party where I am pretty sure it did not touch the grill!  The thin cut fried onions were more of a ball of gooey doughy onion, enough to the extent that I grabbed a menu to see if they had changed the description, they were that bad!!    I would have loved to tell my waitress but with kids o couldn't wait any longer!  Handy thing with the portable kiosk on the table they don't actually have to return to get paid these days!!   I would look else where even if you are desperately hungry and staying at the hotel!  Don't let the 10 steps to the entrance fool you!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bloomington-2
Marie D.,"Minneapolis, MN",107,2,,1.0,8/29/2017,"I know management probably won't care about this negative review since they don't seem to care about anyone's awful experiences here.  First off, when we walked in to be seated, the host said she needed to clear off a table for us. We waited at least 15 minutes to be seated in an entirely empty restaurant. We then proceeded to wait another 10 minutes for the waitress to even come over and greet us and take our drink order. It took so long for the waitress to bring us our drinks, that another waitress came over to see if we've been served. Our original waitress proceeded to scream across the restaurant saying that she had already gotten our drink order. While we were eating, I had accidentally dropped my phone under the table. To my surprise (or rather now looking back at it, not very surprising at all) the floor was absolutely DISGUSTING. There was old food and dirty napkins all over the floor.

Which tasted the same as any other RB we've went to.  I ordered the Royal red robin burger?? (I forgot what the name was LOL) - anyways, it's the only one with an egg on it...I think? We also had another order of their Whisky ---something burger. Can't remember that one either.  Food was 3.5/5 - I still see it as a normal burger. I don't think it's anything too amazing.  We came here around the time they opened, so it wasn't too busy. The only thing that was bothersome was how loud the hosts were since they placed us practically right next to them, when they entire restaurant was open. Other than that, it's not big deal. It's a huge restaurant and it's very clean (just opened, duh).  Service here was pretty good? I wouldn't think it was a 5/5. I'd call it a 4/5 for service, but I understood from the servers point of view.

My only complaint was that our service was very very slow and they did not have that many tables for each waitress to wait on... so I'm not sure what was taking so long... Our waitress also told us they're ""bar was backed up""... I ordered was a beer... And they had two people working the bar... Maybe they just were used to having that many people in the restaurant... But I in general enjoy the ambience of the place... I'm not sure people were complaining about what parking either... There's a giant lot that they share with the shoppingmall in the back... It was pretty easy to park",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bloomington-2?start=40

Mary S.,"Lindstrom, MN",0,3,,2.0,11/7/2016,"This was my second time here.  I waited to post a review as I  hoped the first time was just a bad day but the same problems were present as was on my first visit.  The burgers and chicken are very good and served hot but that is the only positive at this restaurant.  I was seated by the hostess who said my waitress would be over shortly.  I was meeting a friend for dinner and had arrived 20 minutes early.  I looked at the menu, decided on my dinner choice and read several pages of a book I had brought with me.  The waitress never showed up to take my drink order until my friend arrived.  The waitress heard me tell my friend that I hadn't seen a waitress yet so wasn't sure when she would be here.  When she came over, she didn't apologize for being late/slow, just took our orders. The fries I received were lukewarm at best.  They were not fresh and tasted like they had sat under a warming light for quite some time.  I had 2 bites left of my sandwich when the waitress came by and asked about the food.  I told her about the fries and she did offer to give me more fries and said some fresh ones would be done shortly but at that point it was too late as my sandwich was almost gone.  She did not offer to deduct anything from the bill for this.  Red Robin should do away with their bottomless fries and lower the prices so they are more in line with Applebee's or TGIF.  I can't imagine many people want seconds of stale, lukewarm fries. She came back later to explain the  bill paying system and our bill was ready.   My friend had to ask her if she could order dessert.  The waitress took her dessert order and left without asking if I wanted anything.   My friend ordered the short stack of mini donuts.  Do not order these.  They are sprinkled with SALT,  not sugar.   Nothing in the dessert description indicates this which can be a serious problem for someone with high blood pressure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bloomington-2?start=20
Kristin M.,"Benson, MN",21,1,,1.0,9/4/2017,"Just went there on Friday night with 6 adults.  We were seated right away and waiter took drink order.  2 waters, 2 alcohol drinks, 2 lemonades.  Waters came about 5 minutes later.  One lemonade came about 5 minutes after that, then the other about 5 minutes later.  After about 15 minutes my husband got his beer.  It took another 5-7 minutes for my wine to arrive.  It took roughly an hour from the time we got there before we even got our food.  When my husband asked for another beer it took about 15 minutes to get it.  Meanwhile a table of 6 and 4 received their food before us when we had been there for a good 15 minutes before they were even seated.  When we complained they told us they had let half the staff leave at 5:15 because they weren't busy.  They also blamed the State Fair.  Even though we complained to both the waiter and the manager on duty they blew us off and never once apologized.  We won't be going there again.  There are far too many excellent places in the area we can go to without ever needing to go back.  Busy is one thing but the total lack of customer service is pathetic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bloomington-2?start=20
Chris L.,"Cary, IL",4,17,,2.0,6/29/2017,"Been here a few times by default. I usually stay at the Hilton next door for business. When I'm car-less in the winter where I don't want to walk in the cold it's my only option if I'm that hungry or perhaps go in there for a cocktail. This place is probably good for a young crowd. The teenaged, millennials and sort that do not know good quality food and service.  The burgers are frozen patties, fries are way over salted and staff are barley 23 years old. The cocktails are poorly made and over priced. Staff could be slow too even if you're sitting at the bar. Typical corporate chain place. If you're okay with that you'll be okay with this place. They're all the same as I've experienced in my travels from state to state. It's the same for any Red Robin (Chilis, Outback and even worse Applebee's).  In the area if you want a really good pub food with a great quality fresh beef patty burger I'd suggest Lucky 13 down the street. Ask for their Lucky13 tots too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bloomington-2?start=20
Valerie M.,"Rosemount, MN",0,14,5,2.0,12/5/2016,"Came here for a friends birthday-- it was a Tuesday and surprisingly very busy. I've been to the Red Robin in Apple Valley multiple times and was very satisfied so I had the same expectation at this location as well. In short, I'm giving this specific location a 2/5 simply because the burgers and milk shakes were delicious. The service, on the other hand, was atrocious to put it lightly. When we received our food, our waitress must have made the mistake of putting the same burger twice. I received a plain bacon burger instead of the guacamole burger. I gave her the benefit of the doubt since it was busy. I was in a good mood after all. We had not seen our server in a while so we decided to ask another staff member to correct my order. She denies and says ""nope, that's the guac burger alright."" My partner and I paused, as I was dissecting my burger while waiting for our respective server and knew for a fact that there was zero guac in the burger. She decides to cut us off before we could correct her and say ""I'll get you more guac."" Strike two for RR since there wasn't any guac in the first place.  She comes back and asks me to check the burger once more. I comply just to prove her wrong, I peel the burger apart and repeat, ""I don't see any guac."" She drops the container of guac in front of my friends and I, points to the container, and says ""there"" and walks away. My friends and I look at each other, perplexed at the upright rudeness of that particular staff member. Strike three RR.  My server finally comes by after the other staff leaves our table and asks how the food is tasting. I politely explain that she must've gotten my burger wrong (simply because there was more ingredients missing so I decided to ask for a completely new order of my previous desire.) She quickly apologizes and brings back the right order. Woo, finally. My friend had also ordered a shake with his burger, which came later and... you guessed it! The wrong flavor. Strike four.. My friend decides to roll with it since he knew it would take a while to get the correct one (the shake came at the same time as our check). When I saw his shake I actually wanted one myself, but thought it wasn't worth it since it would probably come half an hour later and be the wrong flavor anyway. We stopped by Sonic for my milkshake which was fast and the right flavor. Moving onto the food: the chefs cooked our burgers to PERFECTION! It was so delicious and so was the guac! I ended up taking the extra guac that was brought to our table by the rude server home to eat it with chips and I have to say I'd bring a whole order of guac home if I could. Anyway I love Red Robin's, however this location was a real let down. TLDR: Service is awful, burgers are good! Although not enough to make me come back.. to this location anyway.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bloomington-2?start=20
Shakeel S.,"Round Lake, IL",20,23,5,1.0,8/6/2016,"I understand that you can't expect much from a restaurant chain but I was hoping for bit of consistency, boy I was surprised. Not a really good and welcoming Red Robin location and I have been to a few before.  Our service was superficial, food was not prepared per our instructions, no follow up on our drink or food orders, and incompetency from hostess to server to the manager throughout our experience.  Here is some details for those who would like to know more. 1- Hostess told us to wait before she can sit us but the restaurant was like 50% empty, apparently putting us in the worst possible table as possible, was her goal; with no napkins, no silverware, no view of tv and on only table with no electronic hub 2- server was efficient in taking over order we order 2 drinks with free refills (never got free refills), order 3 entrees with bottomless side (never received refills on those either) 3- order salad with specific instructions for no Bacon, when I got my order it had bacon all over it, even though server wrote it down and repeat it back to me.  When I notified our server she apologized and manager personally came to redelivered my order saying that he had it remade from scratch and I believed him.  I begin eating the salad and ate about 1/4th but when I flipped the chicken piece over I found pieces of bacon under the chicken that were left when they simply scrape off the bacon from the salad (see picture). By this time we were completely turned off by their in competencies and started to recollect our experience since the moment We walked in.  This Red Robin is one of the worst restaurant when it comes to customer service, food preparation and quality control checks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bloomington-2?start=20
Jessica K.,"Minneapolis, MN",189,227,10,2.0,1/18/2016,"I've been to several red robins before and have always been in love with them. I mean come on, who can go wrong with bottomless fries?!  My mom and I decided to go here for lunch on New Years Eve. We arrived and they attempted to sit us in the most akward table in the bar that was right next to the pos. We had to ask to be moved because it was just way to akward and there was a abundance of tables open. We were moved to a different table and shortly after our server came.  They have these neat tablets on the table. Obviously they are a opportunity for revenue because you can buy your kids games to keep them occupied. In addition you can order apps and desserts but that is it. At the end you pay on this. That is where the issue comes in...we didn't use it out of choice, because it was FILTHY! Apparently they do not wipe these down. I was so terrified that touching it would give me a cold that is going around the local day care.  We ordered our food and of course they come with bottomless fries. The serving (because of this) is usually very small. Somehow the waitress was MIA. We slowed down but just wanted more fries. Its like she knew we wanted more fries so she avoided us.  The service was mediocre at best. The cleanliness was bad.

Frank A.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,39,,1.0,4/7/2017,"I'll just get to the point: this location sucks.  Our hostess was clearly bored and uninterested in her job, sealed with a wide open mouth yawn and an uninspired ""enjoy your meal"".  Our server informs us he'll be right with us. And ""right with"" means ten minutes later with water. When he finally does take our order it's on a napkin.  For whatever reason a second server brings us our food. When I ask her for the ketchup bottle on a nearby table- as our table had none- she says ""oh, I'll bring you a new bottle"", then doesn't. Never saw her again.  And forget about a beverage refill. I mean you can get one, but you'll be waiting longer than what I would consider a reasonable time. At least the server acknowledged and apologized for this.  On the way out some hoodlum was laying on his back in a booth, playing with his phone, feet out in the isle, solidifying my low opinion of this establishment.  Oh, and the food- it was ok. I thought $11 was a little much for four smallish chicken strips that were on par with say Culvers, but it wasn't terrible. Just over-priced with shitty service.  All in all I got McDonald's quality service with food that was marginally better. Needless to say I wouldn't recommend this location nor will I be spending another dime here.

Today it was a quick five minutes, but when we got to our seats I saw there were plenty of booths still available. Puzzling? Doesn't really matter though. For one, if you don't like burgers, then Red Robin is not the place for you. I had a hard time picking out what to eat, because there were a lot of delicious choices to choose from. I chose the Royal Red Robin btw. We got our food quick, and with the burger and endless fries, everything was great! But with the endless fries, I just expect the employees to come around a lot.

Travis Y.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,17,,2.0,2/7/2016,We decided to go here after bowling last week.  We were sat down and waited 10 minutes before anyone took our drink order.   They have small monitors for you to order instead of dealing with a waitress apparently which later on seemed to be the reason the staff was so piss poor.  In order to get a drink we had to get the attention of the bartender (who was very rude) because our waitress was missing for most of the evening.  I guess when you have a tablet to order from the staff gets used to being lazy and not having to do anything.  They are top notch at that here.   So we finally ordered up some burgers.  We were all asked if we would like our burgers to be a little pink in the middle or not and all 6 of us decided to go with pink in the middle.  Unfortunately when the burgers came out all 6 of them were well done...pretty sad.  Then they have endless fries or so they say.  As I said earlier our waitress was nonexistent the entire meal always off somewhere else on her phone or chatting with the other lazy staff.  No one at my table got a chance to get the 2nd helping of fries until 30 minutes after our meal came.  We then waited 15 more minutes for the fries to be delivered.  We each got a basket that came with a whopping 15 fries.   The fries were tasty and that's why 2 stars is the rating.  Aside from that it's a 1 star restaurant all the way.  I would highly advise not going here.  Piss poor wait staff and average food at expensive prices.  Go to Red Cow and be mind blown.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bloomington-2?start=20

Kim N.,"Minneapolis, MN",44,35,189,3.0,11/28/2015,"It's 10:55 in the am and I'm effing starving. My friend, Jen, and I decided to meet for an early 11am lunch. Red Robin is scheduled to open at 11. We get inside at 10:56 and the hosts tell us to have a seat, they don't open until 11am. If you don't open until 11am, then don't unlock your doors until 11am. Another host walks by and reminds us we open at 11. Immediately after that oh so friendly second reminder, a manager informs them they are open and to seat us. Thank you, Sir! A young lady tells us to follow her. She tries to seat us in the bar at a high top for two. Are you kidding me?! The restaurant just opened and we are your first customers, seat us at a booth for heaven's sake! These two person high tops should be your last resort. Jen read my mind and asked her to seat us at a booth. She walks us out of the bar and says, ""I don't know what tables are open.""  Is she still training? I thought to myself. All the tables are open!!! Finally we reach an OPEN booth, and she tells us she'll be up front if we need anything. Honey, if I need something I will ask my server. What does she think I will go seek her out?  To make a long story short, bottom line is, don't come here to eat or converse with others, unless you like getting interrupted every 47 nanosecconds. I swear we met the entire staff, minus the kitchen. While its nice for them to see our every need is met, we don't need everyone on the payroll stopping by to ask us how the food is, ask us if we need our bottomless steak fries refilled, more water? How 'bout our rewards program?  It was overkill. Lots of staff standing around looking bored when they weren't bombarding our booth. They were very overstaffed.

Kristen K.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,5,2,2.0,1/1/2016,"My husband and I thought we'd try out the new Red Robin that just opened a few miles from home. I wish we hadn't. Our server was decent, but it took 45 minutes for our burgers to come out! Not like they had people waiting to get in either. I spotted the food runner trying to deliver our food to a table at the opposite end of the row. Watched him walk back to the kitchen and come out a couple minutes later to our table. When the burgers arrived, they only had fries for one of us. I ordered garlic aioli sauce and it had clearly spilled allover the tray. The runner served me a half empty dip that had sauce allover the outside of the cup. He said he would be back shortly with the fries for my husband. He didn't come back. Finally, after my husband had finished his burger (which was supposed to be some burger loaded with bacon- there were a few tiny crumbles of bacon on it) the server went to track down some fries and didn't bring his dipping sauce. He said it takes a while to make. At this point we had already been there for an hour! At last, he comes out with another tray of fries with cheese melted allover. Why wouldn't he just be honest and say they don't have a cheese dipping sauce?  So, we got charged for extra fries because of it, too. At the end, I ordered a malt from the console on the table to go. When the bartender delivered, there was ice cream and caramel sauce allover the outside of the cup. Come on, Burger King does a better job of serving! For two burgers, a beer, a malt and a side of dipping sauce our bill was $41. I did like my burger, whiskey bbq, but What a rip off. They have some serious kinks to work out. I really was hoping to love this place since it's so close to home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bloomington-2?start=60
