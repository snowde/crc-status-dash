Thia H.,"Boise, ID",106,33,14,3.0,11/29/2017,I mean... it's a chain restaurant and that's how it feels when you walk in. The menus and full of pictures and it's easy to pick out what to eat. I had a mai Thai and it was good. The patron margarita was a little too sweet for my liking. My friend found the plastic tie from a plastic bag in his salad but I understand things happen and they took it off the bill so it wasn't the biggest deal. Our server was super sweet and fast. I think this place is very kid friendly and would be fun for a birthday dinner. I've always gotten a burger and I'm never disappointed and you can't go wrong when it comes with bottomless fries!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise

John S.,"Boise, ID",131,387,871,3.0,11/11/2016,"I'm kind of so-so with Red Robin. They have a great selection of burgers with many different toppings. I like the creativity of their research and development arm but it seems like the fillings are meant to cover up for the bland hamburgers themselves. The burger had the appearance of a pre-formed, possibly frozen burger like those from the place with the golden arches. Only the size of the burger leaned more toward the size of a Quarter Pounder than the 10-to-one pound regular burgers of the other place. However, it didn't appear the Chop House burger I ordered had any seasoning added to it. By itself, it was pretty bland. Lucky it came with onion straws, mushrooms and some kind of Dijon sauce. It also came with steak sauce, but fearing the worst, I asked for it on the side. Thank goodness. There's no better way to ruin a perfectly good guitar, errr, steak or hamburger by masking it with steak sauce. I dipped a French fry into it and nearly keeled over. It was awful. I was seated at a table in the bar, which meant the bartender had to tend with me, three or four other tables, plus several people seated at the bar. He spent about two seconds every time he sort of stopped at my table. Did more of a ""is everything ok,"" ""do you need some more water,"" ""can I get you some more fries,"" on the fly.  Red Robin is typically busy and this lunchtime was no exception. While my server was friendly at each short encounter, I noticed two other servers and what I assumed was some sort of manager tight-lipped the entire time. They didn't appear friendly to customers or workers alike. I was glad I wasn't in their areas, even though I was close enough to observe them. I enjoyed watching the couple seated around the corner from me. They didn't say five words during the entire meal. They were both too busy texting. Guess they should have gone out for lunch with the people on the other end.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise

Moving on, we can't sit at the bar, not clean, with other customers dinner ware left behind. On to the high table by the window, appears clean, but after 2-3 minutes, forearms are sticking to table.  That's it, off to Freddie's. Quick service, clean table.

We were both starving and maybe even a tad bit grumpy upon arrival but that changed almost as soon as we met our server,  Bill.  Not only was he courteous and knowledgeable about the menu, he was also amazingly quick and extremely competent. Our food was delicious and Bill was bar none the best server we've ever had at any restaurant. Absolutely amazing! He brought us their famous 'bottomless fries' within a minute and they were cooked to perfection. He kept our drinks filled, fries on the table, and endless sides of ranch and honey mustard. He seemed to know what we needed even before we did. I couldn't be more impressed with the quality of food or the phenomenal service. Thanks for a great night.

I think I ordered whiskey river bbq burger and if it will be the only thing I ate , I would have to leave hungry.   Their incentive program is also way complicated and demands too much of a personal information.    I also liked bottomless coleslaw option.So overall not particularly impressed , but not discouraged from future visits it adds some diversity to Poky's burger options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise

It's my lunch hour and I don't have much time to sit and wait for some lazy hostess to get us a table. We are completely incensed. We sit down for a minute, talk about it and decide to leave. Instead of just leaving, we inform the hostess, she is completely indifferent. My wife calls to talk to the manager to complain.  After being placed on hold for five minutes, someone picks up the phone to say the manager is ""too busy"" and to call back later?!? What?!?

Alyssa M.,"Donnelly, ID",159,13,5,1.0,1/31/2016,"This was one of the worst service experiences I have ever had. When an employee brought my salad to the table, I asked them to box it up because I had to leave, and they took it. I never saw this salad again. And then as I mentioned this to them when they checked in 15 long minutes later, they did not apologize for losing my salad or wasting my time. The server also messed up my check and was completely unapologetic when he was unable to fix it. I had to wait at my table at least 30 minutes after my last bite because the server couldn't figure out how to change the check. I would have appreciated an apology for the amount of time I had to wait, but I never got one. The food was not great. The cheese sauce that came with my pretzel bites had film that formed over the top and my friend's hummus plate had dry carrots and wilted celery. I was not impressed by the management or the customer service here.

She took our phone numbers (those of us who were loyalty members) and informed me of their gluten free bun(which made the wheat-intolerant in me very happy).  The desserts were DE LISH. We got the fruffles and the mile high mudd pie. YUM. The garlic aioli and campfire sauce were also a thing of beauty. Bottomless(yummy) fries. My burger was free because it's my birthday month and I'm part of the loyalty club. The cons; Service was pretty slow, even though we were literally the only table in the restaurant.

The concept was fresh, 30 years ago. The restaurant is nearly identical to what it was back then. The service today was slow. Our waitress forgot to ask me what salad dressing I wanted and instead of coming back to ask me, she just gave me ranch. But I couldn't eat my salad because she forgot to bring silverware.

It all started when I walked in and could not believe how utterly filthy the carpet was, it clearly had not been cleaned in the four years that we've been gone. The restaurant needed painting and the Sports memorabilia on the walls was very dated. I was truly disappointed in the food as well It just did not live up to memories or expectations.

Kamile I.,"Boise, ID",2,4,1,1.0,6/21/2015,"Hardly a one star experience. There are a number of reasons that contributed to the overall negative experience today which truly surprised me because I've always been pleased with my visits. The customer service was not up to par with your brand and here is what I noted on my visit: 1. We waited for 10 minutes for our waitress to acknowledge us, but she was nowhere insight. Keep in mind the restaurant did not appear busy. Upon greeting the table Kelsey asked if we were ready to order food. No drinks were at the table yet and she took the napkins and silverware away at this time. She seemed irritated we wanted to get a drink of water. 2. Waters were dropped off and slide to each person. I was looking down at my phone and was surprised that suddenly a large glass was in front of me. I guess I should have been ready for that, luckily it didn't hit me in the face. 3. Food arrived at the table, dropped off by a kitchen assistance or hot food runner. His apparel looked like he was a cook as he had on a black chef coat and hairnet. Two of the four meals were given to us incorrectly than what we had requested. Small things like having the bbq sauce of the whiskey burger on the side and an extra side of buzzard sauce were looked over- not complicated requests. We also didn't have utensils or napkins. So we requested the sauces and table settings and were told that he would get someone to bring us those things. It seemed like we were halfway through eating when they finally arrived to the table.  4. As we ate I observed other tables she was helping. One table got their tab and the receipt had the incorrect food charged to the customer, Kelsey didn't seem thrilled about needing to correct the charges. I noted this same table request sides and not get them for a long period of time. Another table also waited for a long while to be greeted and served beverages. The third table who appeared to be engaging with Kelsey, chatting up her cute new belt buckle, all appeared to be having a nice time. Their food arrived and I observed the front host who seated us had set down a tray of food for their table. He picked up the first plate, got some sauce on his hand, then while holding the plate proceeded to lick his hand, then served the table the dish. I was disgusted. The parents backs were toward the host so there would have been no way they could have seen it unless they turned around. 5. I asked for the tab, and confirmed that we need it on one check. She brought the cards back, because we split the tab and dropped it at the table and left in a hurry. Clearly friendly and happy to have us. We opened the check book only to find our cards, the receipts soaking wet, and an ice cube (I guess for dessert?). So after filling out our soggy receipt we departed.  The craziest part about it was that two male managers appeared to be working, wearing normal clothes. How does this happen with not one but two managers on staff?  I would say that Kelsey did keep our water glasses filled and the food was good.  I'm saddened to say I likely won't visit this Red Robin again. I worked as a server for 6 years and am a previous employee of Red Robin. It's disheartening to see a lack of customer service at an establishment I once worked at.  I do hope this feedback gets back to the team and you are able to take this as constructive to work on your cleanliness and customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise?start=20

What makes THIS Red Robin (Parkcenter Blvd.) even better is the inside -the atmosphere. I'm a natural-light kind of guy. I prefer that over fluorescent lights overhead. This RR has almost ALL natural light. On warm days you can eat outside on the patio, or stay inside and still be bathed in sunlight (during the hot days the AC is blowing so you wont get the sting of sunlight on your skin). Half of the restaurant is encased in large wall-windows. I love it. And the view of the lake isn't half bad either. We've had great service every time we have gone there.  And because you are in Boise State nation, there are plenty of wall decorations and autographs memorializing past BSU football glory. This RR is the best one I've been to and whenever we are in the Boise area, we ALWAYS hit this before we skate back to Twin Falls.

Dave R.,"Boise, ID",14,33,2,1.0,9/3/2013,"If your in Boise ID. you should avoid this Red Robin and visit the other locations on Milwaukee or Eagle. In the last year I visited this Red Robin's twice and after bad encounters with the service back to back, I will never return to this location. The food has been mediocre both visits and servers seem to have issues with more than two tables. The food does not equal the quality of any of the other Red Robin's from Boise to Caldwell. Both visits fell short on all of chain restaurants standards. The first and second visit started with a horrible greeting from the host. The most recent visit (today, Sept. 2nd) I walked in to be ignored by the host, she was busy flirting with the carpenter and they were not talking about his carpenter project. I was given no ""Hi"" or ""Welcome to Red Robin,"" I had to initiate the short conversation to ask where to pick up my food. She pointed to the bar, to which, no one was at the bar. The restaurant was dead, so I don't believe this girl had any excuses to be short with me. It also didn't excuse her from not greeting me at all. Isn't this the reason to have a host stand at the front door?  Last fall my girlfriend and I went in to grab a bite to eat on our day off. When we were sat we asked for a window seat to see the lake, which seemed to be a burden for this person. I guess this was excused because the restaurant was completely empty of customers at the time. The server eventually came over to greet us to get our drinks and seemed to forget our existence when another table came in. This other table was a six top so he was excused to not take our order or bring our drinks back. The manager had to ask if we had been helped and had to finish out our dining experience. I understand getting a bigger table can be challenging, but completely ignoring of forgetting a table is inexcusable.  If your in Boise and fancy a burger, head anywhere besides the Parkcenter Red Robin. You could also try Big Jud's or Boise Fry Company (bison burger and a ton of variations of fries) where you will have a great dining experience with a local restaurant :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise?start=20
Stacie F.,"Boise, ID",0,5,,1.0,7/25/2015,"Stopped into Red Robin with some als after a memorial service and ordered a hamburger. I specifically asked for the meat patty to be on a separate plate because I don't eat meat and one of my friends wanted extra. I got my order and it came with the meat patty on it. I explained to the waitress my allergy and she took it back so it could be fixed. No big deal. Happens a lot anywhere I go, so I'm pretty patient. When she brought it back, the cooks literally just took the patty off the bun, stuck the patty on the plate, without replacing the rest of them items that the patty had touched. I ended up not being able to eat it and still paid the ten dollars for my meal. A bun cost like what, fifty cents max? The veggies maybe another fifty cents and same with the cheese?  Due to the laziness and lack of consideration to my needs as a paying customer, which I think were fairly reasonable and simple, I will never go back to this restaurant and probably other Red Robin franchises, ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise?start=20
Douglas G.,"Boise, ID",1,8,1,1.0,5/23/2015,"Had a large group of kids and called to see how busy they were. Told we could get right in if we came down within twenty minutes.  Got there in ten minutes, place was packed and told by the same girl that they had a forty five minute wait and a whole bunch of large tabletops had come in.  Would appreciate it if your staff was more honest on the telephone.  We are glad that we ended up saving $200, went to Albertsons, got chicken, three side salads, green salad and spent $28.  We are glad we didn't spend money on overpriced hamburgers and poor service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise?start=20

Jared P.,"Boise, ID",3,39,10,2.0,3/27/2013,"Ordered a Avo-Cobb-O Salad (Cobb Salad): Chicken was rubbery and tough and appeared to be just barely cooked as it had a pinkish tinge, not like it was raw, but could have been cooked another 1-2 minutes.  Fish and Chips:  fries as expected were spot on. Plate was sent incomplete, missing a piece of cod which was delivered 2-5 minutes later, and was good as well.  Overall, I would rather the food had been slowed a few minutes to allow for proper cooking and plating so the entire entrees had been delivered together and properly cooked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise?start=40
Andrew E.,"San Diego, CA",77,27,,2.0,11/14/2012,"I went to a Red Robins years ago and swore it off. Today I decided to try it out again. In the middle of the meal I remember why I swore it off all those years ago. The food is just the most bland food ever. I had a 'Shroom Burger. The burger was less than mediocre and the mushrooms were flavorless.  If you like burger chains, save your money for Fudd Rucker's, Boise Fry Company, or even Burger King.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise?start=40
Lucid Dreaming X.,"Boise, ID",0,18,17,3.0,2/25/2013,"Yes, I eat here approximately once every 18 months or so. Clean and friendly.

Callum S.,"Seattle, WA",4,150,7,5.0,8/28/2012,This is my favorite Red Robin location.  The staff is really friendly and remembers my family and what we usually want to eat. The food is always good.

Patricia W.,"Boise, ID",4,48,14,4.0,1/16/2014,"This was my favorite place to go as a kid. It's my favorite burger joint now only because of the Bonzai burger (I don't order burgers anywhere else, just not a big burger person). The service is always great (and I eat here a few times a year), and it's a cool location by the lake. They have a decent beer menu (always a few micro brews, and I'm not talking about blue moon). If you want a good meal with friendly servers, give it a shot. Yeah, it's a chain, but they do it right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise?start=40
David F.,"Boise, ID",122,263,170,3.0,8/10/2010,"This is a good place to take a multi-generational crowd. The Burnin' Love Burger is nice and spicey. Comes with endless supply of fries or a salad. The Salmon Burger is pretty good too. Better than the dried fish pucks you sometimes get at the chains. Kids menu items are a little small for older kids. Sitting outside is really nice despite the small noise level from the street. There are ducks and squirrels that are spoiled by the handouts. Tonight we had a little rain and we fought with the umbrellas and strings of lights, but eventually got some protection. Thanks to the manager who came out to help us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise?start=40
Julie E.,"Boise, ID",195,326,264,2.0,2/22/2014,"My husband and I have been dining at this Red Robin for about 6 years.  We USED to call it our favorite sit down burger place.  We hadn't been there for about a year and went back a few months ago to a VERY mediocre and less than impressive visit.  We chalked it up as a 'bad day'.  Today we went back and things were no better.  Red Robin seems to have made a LOT of changes to be competitive with places like Five Guys and Smash Burger and their overall experience as suffered from it.  From the kitzchy but cute baskets and bright colors to plain plates, fries in cold metal rings and what feels like a muted atmosphere.   Today my husband ordered the Chili Chili Cheeseburger, which USED to be served open faced with plenty of chili.  Today it was not open faced and it looked like there was maybe half a cup of chili on it.  The fries on our plates seemed to be old, and even additional fries brought to us later seemed some how aged and overcooked on the edges.  Very disappointing to ME was to discover that their tropical green tea comes from a box.  It tastes overly processed.  There were a GAGGLE of severs and very few patrons.  We've decided that if we DO go back to Red Robin again it will not be at the Park Center location- that's if we ever give them another try.  Very sad and disappointing when  a corporate attempt to 'keep up with the Jones' ruins a perfectly good place to enjoy a meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise?start=40
Benjamin C.,"Minneapolis, MN",20,9,8,4.0,8/12/2011,"Great burgers at good prices. Some of the coldest beer you'll find, which is nice after biking or rollerblading on the nearby Greenbelt. One of the better patios you'll see, since it is right on Parkcenter Pond. The only strike against the place is that the service can be hit or miss. My last time there, the server was AWOL for much of my visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise?start=40
Rose B.,"Boise City, ID",2,87,90,3.0,9/27/2009,"Classic Red Robin atmosphere. Great selection on the menu and the service is quick and friendly. We went at a slow time of the evening, which was nice but it can get fairly busy in there. The Gourmet Burger Special is a great deal, $14.99 for two gourmet burgers and a dessert. We had the California Chicken Burger and the Monster Burger, both were decent and the Mile High Mud Pie for dessert, very sweet. We saved about $10 doing this. The food is filling and you get bottomless fries, though we weren't offered any more fries like we were supposed to...otherwise great place to go for lunch or dinner and they are open somewhat late.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise?start=40
Jodie E.,"Boise, ID",13,4,,4.0,8/27/2011,"Surprisingly good vegetarian options.  Try the patty melt made with a Boca burger.  The servers are friendly and the atmosphere, while a little loud, is pleasant.  We like sitting outside and watching the volley ball players.

Derek B.,"San Francisco, CA",29,371,50,3.0,11/18/2007,"Food is up to par with other Red Robin's I've been to (god I'm a dork) but the service when I was here was pretty awful. We sat at a table close to (but not at) the bar and our server was the bartender.  It was lunch time on a Saturday and I think there was a Boise State game that day so it wasn't really busy at all.  He totally lacked in the attention department though/  We had to eat half our meals without soda refills and the ranch dressing we wanted for our chicken fingers.   It's the simple things man... c'mon. One fun side note: From where we were sitting we could see a dry erase board in the kitchen with all the ""staff priorities"" and the number one thing was ""to always serve piping hot fries.""  And I must admit, our fries were piping hot!  For that, I will give you 3 stars instead of 2.  But I recommend bumping ""drink refills"" up the priority list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise?start=40
