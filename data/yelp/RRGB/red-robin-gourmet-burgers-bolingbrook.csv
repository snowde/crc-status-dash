Kristin Y.,"Bolingbrook, IL",0,1,,4.0,1/2/2018,This is a great place to go out to eat with your family.  It's not to expensive but not also a fast food kind of place.  I really enjoy my experience everytime I go.  Most servers are friendly and very attentive.  The managers are always walking around checking up on customers and helping out in every way possible to make the Red Robin a great pace! I recommend this place highly,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bolingbrook
MoMo K.,"University Village, Chicago, IL",462,389,2173,3.0,8/19/2016,"It's okay, not too good but not horrible either. The onion rings were delicious. The portion size seems small for the price. I got the platter for $15 which I thought would be enough to share with my sister but it was only for one person and I didn't even feel full. You can see the picture I took of my platter. It's not like it tastes bad, but thought I could have got more food for $15 especially bc it's not a fancy restaurant or anything.  The service is typical, the waiter was polite and fast. You can pay at the table on an iPad thing and even order from the table as well. No wifi!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bolingbrook
Samy A.,"Bensenville, IL",4,29,2,1.0,9/26/2017,Wat a disappointment we barly moved into area and had the shittiest service my waitress took for ever on evrything literally had finished our food before I got another refill and my kids shakes took like half an hour last time coming here to this location,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bolingbrook
Noel J.,"Wheaton, IL",4,9,9,3.0,7/19/2017,"- great choices and options for burgers - decent choices of fries - burgers were generally decent, nothing too spectacular  - i was underwhelmed by the steak fries - the onion ring appetizers was perfect. No flour, onions cooked, crispy outside - sauces were okay, barbeque seemed to be tangy and housemade, ranch didnt seem so",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bolingbrook
Davulcha S.,"Chicago, IL",49,78,1,4.0,9/18/2017,"the Sunday bartender is very friendly and enjoyable!  Went here because of a gift card (hate to say that I would probably never walk into this place unless I had one)  Nachos were pretty good appetizer, the Absolute freckled lemonade was a good deal at under 5 bucks, definitely worth it!  If ever up in this direction, I'd swing by for a drink and app again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bolingbrook
Karen K.,"Lockport, IL",77,169,1931,3.0,7/27/2016,"I havent been to  a Red robin in almost 10 years.  My son and i did a date night and he wanted a burger so red robin it was.  The service was very friendly, helpful and timely.  We ordered the boneless wings with terriyaki sauce as an appetizer.  My son loved them.  I wasnt crazy about the sauce it had a strong taste of salt or something i couldnt put my finger on but didnt care for.  My son got a bacon cheeseburger he loved it. I thought it was pretty good. I ordered a california chicken sandwich that had bacon cheese tomatoe and avocado.  It was good but I felt like the chicken could of been seasoned a little more.  The fries were standard steak fries and the fruit was pretty good.  It was mostly apples.  I wouldnt mind coming here again but dont think I will be craving it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bolingbrook
A L.,"Lockport, IL",1,86,23,4.0,5/22/2017,"I like red Robin because of the great selection of burgers,  And that you can substitute, unlimited side salad, Coleslaw, or steamed vegetables in place of unlimited fries  I've always been happy with the service here And a nice selection of beers is a plus Nice atmosphere here and family friendly too Their rewards program is an added bonus",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bolingbrook
David S.,"Melrose Park, IL",0,2,1,5.0,5/23/2017,I would like to say that the service at this Red Robin is exceptional. The manager Candice went above and beyond for me and my wife.

Daniel Y.,"Chicago, IL",425,311,2254,2.0,3/7/2016,"I used to like Red Robin many years ago when I was younger and was indifferent about ingredients and quality. Now that I look back and visiting this establishment over the weekend, I'm disappointed at what Red Robin has turned into. Tablets on every table. An entertainment fee ($1.99) tacked on to the bill as soon as your kids start tapping away at games on the tablet that no one mentions. I'm an attentive parent, but come on... it's way too easy and fast for this extra charge to be activated. Lesson learned. The burgers have gotten smaller since I last visited (over 5 years ago.) Competition from places like Wendy's and Five Guys doesn't seem to have put any pressure on this place. If you want a good burger that's not frozen, check out those places. While Red Robin caters to families, offers some nice deals, and has plenty of space for patrons, I would much rather suggest you spend your money at other establishments that pay more attention to your food than this place. Service was fine and friendly, but it comes back to the food, doesn't it?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bolingbrook
Bob S.,"Bolingbrook, IL",0,25,7,3.0,6/17/2017,"The last few times I have been there were disappointing.  Both times I ordered the red Robin tavern double burger.  Both times, they sucked.  Perhaps next time I'll try a regular burger again.   I actually didn't finish my last meal from there because I couldn't stomach them.  Restaurant is always clean and food presentation is decent.  My family was ok with their meals, though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bolingbrook
Kelly K.,"New Lenox, IL",61,165,7,3.0,2/17/2016,"This place is just like every other Red Robin I've visited-so they get points for consistency if nothing else. I did like that this location was much less crowded than Orland, and I'd be willing to drive a bit further in order to have a slightly less hectic meal.  We ordered the pretzel bites appetizer and they were perfect. Burgers were made to order, and arrived promptly. Our server was fine, but not the best. We ordered a refill of the bottomless fries and by the time they arrived we were ready for the check. Drink refills were slow going as well, even though there were maybe 8 full tables at the time. The price is high, which is one reason why we don't come here all that often. You can get just as good of a burger at Smashburger for less.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bolingbrook

Leah O.,"Rockford, IL",32,79,51,3.0,7/18/2016,"I had vowed,""...I solemnly swear never to eat at a Red Robin EVER again."" But I thus found myself in one again.  We had a substantial group of 10. To make sure we would have seating we decided to call ahead. After waiting on hold for 10, yes 10, minutes we were told they had a table ready and waiting for us all we needed to do was show up. So we did. When we showed up we were told that our table had been given away to a group of 12. Not cool Red Robin; not cool. They told us that they don't hold tables. Okay, well then don't tell me that there is a table ready and waiting for me. Grrrrrrr. So we waited another 20 minutes.  The only redeemable thing about this experience was A. Our waitress and B. Their ""Nacho Tavern Burger."" There were crunchy bits of tortillas embellishing the spicy pepper jack cheese. It was so surprisingly amazing. And the sweet potato fries are quite exquisite. I could see myself coming back here for that burger and those never-ending fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bolingbrook
Jen R.,"San Marcos, CA",51,237,12,4.0,7/22/2015,"I like Red Robin. They have solid burgers and an okay beer list (just a tip, if you're going to advertise that you have ""brews"", you might want to invest in a bigger tap list, and not have so many mainstream domestics available). I went there for dinner with my lovely mommy and we split the Terminator burger (I will refrain from calling it the Burgernator because that's lame and I'm classy). We each got a side salad and shared sweet potato fries. I was very happy with the meal and have no complaints. My mom seemed content as well. We sat by the bar because there were a lot of screaming demon children running around everywhere and we needed to have a decent mother/daughter conversation. I wish there was a separate area for parties or a soundproof room to throw them in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bolingbrook
Nancy Ann M.,"Bolingbrook, IL",50,184,44,4.0,8/10/2015,A very basic meal out with mom. Red Robin has had the same menu with very little twist for a very long time. Most of their food is very good and their prices are only a little bit high. I am disappointed that you don't get a basket of fries anymore you just get a small cup. Back in the day used to get a basket of fries may bring more out before you could even ask. Our server was very nice. She was polite and attentive enough. The food came out in the requisite 12 minutes or less. Although the restaurant seemed empty and I would not have expected it to be any different.  Overall not a very exciting evening but consistent is sometimes the best.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bolingbrook

The prices attracted me to the Red robins place. My kids had very small kid meals and I guess it was okay. I wish the Kid's meal included a small dessert. I didn't feel the the 2 for $15 deal was great, my burger was bacon cheeseburger it was okay nothing special I didn't feel good after eating it. I couldn't finish the burger.

They sell the 500 ML glasses of Stella at the 22 oz price. 500 ML is 16.9 ounces. We complained and the bartender said it was the correct size.

Connor B.,"Naperville, IL",0,24,1,1.0,8/31/2015,"I will start out by saying that I was never a fan of Red Robin as I don't like steak fries and feel like there are better burger places nearby. Though, I occasionally accompany my mom since she has a gluten allergy and RR can cook their fries 'gluten free'.  We went so she could redeem her 'birthday burger', and everything was fine until our waitress forgot to remove her burger from the check, and then proceeded to short our bill by ~.60 cents. Not to mention that our waitress was somewhat rude and short with us, I could chalk this up to just being a coincidence. But no, the food was also run-of-the-mill; the grilled chicken was chewy.

Bonna M.,"Naperville, IL",37,146,44,2.0,12/19/2014,"We visited this location before seeing a movie in Bolingbrook a few weeks ago.  I had a coupon for a free shake and the family was in the mood for burgers.    The parking lot is fairly large, bar area looked clean and roomy and the restaurant was very chain like with lots of booths and TV sets.  We were seated right when we walked in the door and given their new menu.  About 5 minutes later our server arrived and  seemed less than thrilled to be there.  We ordered a mega shake for our daughter and pops/water for the rest of us along with a pretzel appetizer.  It took about 5 minutes for her to bring the pop/water but no milkshake, she said they were working on it.  Our pretzel appetizer arrived about 5 minutes after our drinks and was warm and the cheese sauce it came with was really, really good.  She came back to the table and took our order.  Most of us got burgers except for our son who ordered kids chicken tenders and fries.  About 15 minutes passed and still no milkshake and no server.  About another 5 to 10 minutes passed and they brought our food out.  The burgers are not like they used to be.  They are more like glorified McDonalds burgers and not cooked to order AT ALL!  Very disappointing.  Still...no milkshake.  Our server finally was in view and we flagged her down asking about the missing shake. She said that they were really backed up and working on it.  Yeh, I don't think so, the restaurant wasn't that crowded and there were very few milkshakes on anyone's table.  Because it had already taken too long I asked for our bill so we could make the movie.  When she brought the bill she also brought the shake.  If it wasn't already free I would've asked for it to be returned.   I really don't think we'll be back.  It's just too much of a chain restaurant and isn't that good for the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bolingbrook?start=20

The onion rings are unctuous as hell, but very tasty, and the fries (I stole some of my daughter's) are quite nice and bottomless, or endless, as it where.

We were greeted by a hostess who seated us at a booth, where we waited for about 10 minutes, making eye contact with multiple servers, before we stopped one to help us. The server we stopped took our drink order and brought us drinks rapidly, and notified a server to take care of us. We ordered a couple burgers, which were delivered in a timely manner, however the burgers were dropped by a server who didn't say a word or ask if we needed any thing else. We had NO napkins, silverware, and empty condiment bottles. After waiting 5min for our server to come check on us, my honey stopped a server to ask for napkins because I refuse to touch my food without a napkin, but THAT server never brought us napkins. Our server finally came over about 10 min after food delivery, which food is now cold, but he promptly brought napkins. Taste of the burger, overall, was good - even though it was now cold. Our server asked if we'd like more fries, which was nice, considering they were warm.  We left, I was very bummed. Being in the food service industry for seven years, I know my way around restaurants - and this entire experience was a total and utter shame. I will not be going back to this establishment, no care for customers were given, in my opinion. In addition, I got sick from the food, but that happens...

It took forever for a waitress to even come by the table after we were seated and then we had to page one to get napkins and silverware after we received our appetizer.  It seems the manager is stingy on these and only provides silverware if you ask for it or he thinks you need it.  Drink refills were non-existent.  Portions keep shrinking.  I used to walk away with half a crispy chicken salad for $12 and now it is not even a meal.  And forget about asking for extra dressing, which they used to just offer.  I think the location is losing money and the operator is cutting back to try to survive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bolingbrook?start=40

Nina C.,"Bolingbrook, IL",0,8,,5.0,7/11/2014,"I go to red robin about 5 times a year, this time with my hubby, We went on a Friday, early (before noon) and were seated quickly.  Our server (Angelica) took our drink orders and asked for the rewards card. It came as no surprise that one of us was due for the birthday burger.  The food arrived about 10 or more minutes later (due to no pink, etc.). I ordered the Sateed 'Shroom with a dipping sauce (garlic) and he ordered the Royal. They both were pretty darned good and came with the cup o'fries. I love that they are sticking to the platter shaped dish and not that dreaded flimsy basket.  The burgers were superb although I prefer the mushrooms at Hardee's over red robin.  Could be that they (Hardee's) uses salt, which could be bad for me anyhoo. We were offered extra fries, but declined.  We also passed on desert although I would have liked to try that one that has everything (includes strawberries and berry sauce). No room to put it away, LOL. We were two burgers away from getting that free one, but I guess even the free burger counts, so next time, we get a free one as well.  I really like that place although it should be noted that if you go with a group of people, you may have to wait longer for your food.  There was a table of 6 men near us and their food took a little longer than they thought it would.  Bigger order, etc.  Not the place to go to if you're on the clock.  It's not fast food :D.  Also, if you don't have your rewards card on you, you can just give them your phone number.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bolingbrook?start=40

HOLY CRAP...best bite of food ever and it is on a gluten free bun??!!! O MY!  I had to stop myself halfway through the burger because I was so scared I was going to have a heart attack...but it was delicious.  And the fries...my weakness in life...they are bottomless.  That means they keep coming!!  I dipped them in their unbelievable ranch dressing in order to make this the least healthy meal of my life.  But hey, if you want to live it up and not worry about calories, go to red robin!  Seriously some good food.  I gave it a four star only because of the health factor (although they do have healthier options).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bolingbrook?start=60
Jiah T.,"Farmington, MI",241,191,,5.0,7/9/2009,"Ok, this feels insane.  I am giving 5 stars to a popular burger chain.  And I see other yelpers' bad reviews, and I probably wouldn't blame them whatsoever from their general experiences.  But I have a unique relationship with Red Robin.  First, I love the food (Bleu Ribbon burger, with parmesan garlic fries and a side of poppyseed honey mustard to dip the fries in, with a coke, holy mother..), and I thoroughly enjoy it everytime.  But the kicker - Never have I ever been to a chain establishment where the service and management has been so outstanding at every single location I've been to, and I mean at least across the midwest.  They are prone to mistakes just like any other, but their service and the way they deal with their customers and any issues is exactly how it should be in a perfect world.  Examples, if you care: Exhibit 1 (Bolingbrook, IL RR) - Once I ordered takeout.  I got there and realized I lost my credit card.  I sat up at the bar for 5 minutes digging feverishly in my purse as the bartender was waiting for me to hand him some kind of payment.. He notices my struggle, and instead of saying ""sorry, have a nice day, try again later"" with a pitied head shake, he tells me to hold on.  The manager then approaches me, tells me to just take the food home and to call him or drop by with the payment later, hands me his card.  Just like that.  This, my friends, is genius.  This is win-win at its best.  They risk losing $10 versus upping the chances to keep a long term satisfied customer. I get my food, and in turn, completely win me over, they also get the $10.  This was their opportunity to express excellent customer service and they took advantage.  It seems like a small gesture and situation, but consistent activity like this builds them up.  Had they done what I would have expected from anywhere else, which would be to deny me my food since I had no form of payment, they get to keep their $10, I lose my food or get it cold 30 minutes later after driving back and forth AGAIN from my home, and then I experience annoyance that will be linked with the memory of the experience of picking up food from Red Robin.  The food then probably goes in the trash. Exhibit 2 (Novi, MI RR) - I was a bystander and a customer in need at this visit.  I was waiting for my food as I watched a woman order their big salad, then send it back FOUR times.  The waitstaff and managers were very accomodating to this obviously crazy bitch.  I was impressed.  Then they brought me back an improperly cooked burger (which frequently happens with any restaurant, unfortunately) - I ordered med rare, they brought me something a little rarer than rare.  I had eaten the outsides of it, they were apologetic, and since I had been full, brought me a new one, packaged up the uncooked one and the new one for me to go to do as I pleased with it.  See, normally restaurants take their food back to trash it.  But I paid for the one you just gave me, and the one you're bringing out is the one you're buying.  Whatever is wrong with it, I should have the option to do as I please with it.  If I leave it at the table, it is yours to trash.  But if I want to take it home to feed it to my dog...  Exhibit 3 (Lansing, MI RR) - There were 3 or 4 of us waiting for our food for too long and the server decided to bring out baskets of fries and checked on us continually while we waited, while risking increasingly irritated customer contact.  This I know because I've been a server.  When the food is taking too long and its not your fault, but you're the one having to deal with customers' angst, it's much easier to just keep walking by and ignoring.  But he didn't.  And we weren't, because he obviously never forgot about us.  When the food got here, the order also got messed up as they brought my sister the wrong burger.  He brought a new one out as fast as they could, then comped it, obviously.  It was just quick and simple, no fuss, prompt resolution, sincerity. I don't know how their training and hiring process is, but it is at a  much higher and precise standard and level than other chains.  It is great to go to a restaurant where you can just get through the experience with not having to deal with barely incompetent staff, but when you get above and beyond service quite like this, it just makes me so happy.  They are always very friendly and warm, but not overbearing and annoying, even while trying to promote new items (applebees, olive garden, chilis, you know the drift - ""would you like to place an order of the onion rings? spinach artichoke dip?"" no. ""how about the breadsticks? its delicious."" no. go the fuck away so I can think about what I want to order.) I am a very happy and loyal customer to Red Robin because they have always treated me the way that every establishment really SHOULD but doesn't even come close.  TEAM RR!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bolingbrook?start=60

My daughter loves the Mac&Cheese and we all love the burgers.
