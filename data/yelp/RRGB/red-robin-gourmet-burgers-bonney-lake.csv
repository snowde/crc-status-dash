Tracey P.,"Bonney Lake, WA",78,41,,5.0,11/1/2015,"After a horrible experience at Hop Jacks we cruised down to Red Robin where we sat in the bar, were treated well, and had excellent service from Tony.  Thank you for your hard work - a one man show in a busy bar and never missed a beat - great job!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bonney-lake?start=40
Heather A.,"Bonney Lake, WA",75,66,3,2.0,7/3/2016,The Ensenada platter was good. Service was horrible!!! Watched the servers or runners whatever you want to call them touch the machines take orders grab straws and put them in people's drinks without washing hands. Shrimp were burnt both times they came out I think oil needs to be changed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bonney-lake?start=40
Joshua M.,"Salinas, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/31/2015,"Arrived at 9:15, sat in the bar. Bartender have good service. Cold food, basically frozen bun on both burgers, cold fries. Sent both burgers back and was scared to have anything else made. Manager Steve never came to the table to apologize or anything. He sent the bartender back out with the check for appetizers and two sodas. Will never go back because Steve showed no hospitality to his only guests in the restaurant. Should of caught on when we walked into an empty restaurant. Steve should not be allowed to work in the hospitality industry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bonney-lake?start=40
Ryan S.,"Renton, WA",3,15,,1.0,6/13/2014,"You have to walk thru the ""employee smoke zone"" to get in the entrance. Great for the kids.... This is the smallest Red Robins I've ever seen. The tables are crammed together and it's not comfortable if you have small children.  Ordered an appetizer for 4 that we never received.  Never had my drink refilled, even after asking.  Asked for a box for leftovers multiple times before saying screw it.  We eat out a ridiculous amount per week and will not be coming back to this sardine can. If asked by friends or family if we've tried this location, which happens regularly, I will tell them to not waste their time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bonney-lake?start=40
Shor T.,"Seattle, WA",27,46,106,3.0,7/18/2014,"We go here for my son but the food isn't that bad. They're pretty tasty. The salads are huge. Service is ok. Our waiter, José, was pretty attentive. It's my first time to try their DGB--grilled chicken on ciabatta. Chicken was not dry at all and it was pretty tasty with all the fixings except that I wish it had more pesto dressing.  My husband had his usual...The Royal Red Robin burger. It comes with an egg...any burger with an egg is awesome!! I'm sure you can add on the egg to any burger as well for an add'l charge. :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bonney-lake?start=40
M. J.,"Bonney Lake, WA",1,42,40,5.0,11/9/2014,"Tonight we had a five star experience at the Bonney Lake Red Robin! Kate was the best server we have had at any RR location in years!! Brought lots of dipping sauces, extra napkins & pop refills without every having to ask!! Perfect service & excellent food from the kitchen - looks like this location has worked out the kinks from their opening first month growing pains! Our table of six left happy & satisfied!

Chuck S.,"Lacey, WA",5,7,,1.0,6/14/2015,"Ordered a $14 burger. Got a $7 product at best. My endless fries ended 20 minutes before I was asked if I wanted more. Place was not busy. Food took forever. Should have saved my money and stayed home. If all Red Robins are like this now, they can kiss my ass. Waste of time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bonney-lake?start=40
Bianca W.,"Tacoma, WA",0,27,2,2.0,4/4/2015,"First of: There is not such a thing as a ""formal entrance"". When you go to what it seems to be an entrance there is a sign asking you to make your ""grand entrance"" through the side door. Inside,the atmosphere is NOT AT ALL what you see at other Red Robins locations. Hostess is clueless and seemed like she was lost. Waitress was friendly but did not seem to pay attention to what she was doing. Took forever to bring my coffee and when she did it was cold. Our food was served by a very nice guy who happened to be the manager (which we did not know at that point). We didn't have any napkins and all the other waitresses seemed to be too busy to see we were trying to get their attention. We had not been to a Red Robin in quite a while, but last time we did, plates were not plastic/melamine and cheap looking. Plates were all greasy and looked like had been handled by 15 people before getting to us. Gross. In fact I was so grossed out I did not eat and told the waitress I wanted to talk to someone about it. Five minutes later, there comes the nice guy, which we learned was the manager,he brought our napkins (!!) and  listened to what I said with a look of dismay in hiss face. He did not appologize for the greasy and dirty looking plates, no. He said it is normal because the cooks wear gloves that get greasy (?) . I have eaten some greasy burguers before in many different places, and they were served in perfect clean plates. So no excuses here, please. He was nice enough to offer me a fresh made burguer since that one was already cold but I was totally thrown off  that I declined.He still had the waitress pack the burguer to go, and bring it to the table, and we were not charged for it. My husband had a couple of bites of his but was also displeased by the dirty plates, so we left to eat somewhere else. Long story short, I do not recommend the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bonney-lake?start=40
Brian D.,"Bonney Lake, WA",16,4,,3.0,11/22/2015,"I used to come to this place often. The most recent time, I got a burger and it was under cooked ( pink on a medium well) also the bun became very small and soaked... Very annoying.  This might of just been a mistake but all the other times I go here it is rather sub par. You won't die of you go here but you won't be satisfied with your purchase.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bonney-lake?start=40

Tina V.,"Auburn, WA",6,62,16,1.0,2/6/2015,"I absolutely HATE this red robin, for multiple reasons. First they always try and put my family of four in the middle table which is in the way of everything.  They attempted to make a few more 4 spots so they have 3 tables that are directly in the middle of the restaurant. Second, if you go in during lunch time or any normal busy time expect to wait and wait wait when there are tables readily available. It's managed very poorly. Sucks  cause red Robin is a natural go to place when you have kids and want a bite to eat. I drive to auburn to go to that Red Robin cause I despise this one so much",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bonney-lake?start=40
Ellie V.,"Bonney Lake, WA",51,46,14,1.0,3/1/2015,If we can't be seated let alone be greeted or acknowledged within the first 5 min we stood there waiting then I guess they don't need our business.  Oh but 3 workers did make eye contact but not one even bothered to say anything...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bonney-lake?start=40
Heather K.,"Bonney Lake, WA",0,6,,4.0,10/10/2015,We always sit in the bar and have great service. Food is always good and served correctly (and I usually have lots of substitutions ;).

Tori T.,"San Diego, CA",0,27,17,4.0,2/6/2015,"This particular red robin is different than most. It has clean lines, great decor and as always good food. The service is always top notch in the bar seating area. I have felt that the service in the main dining room is a bit lacking though sometimes. The food has come out incorrect a couple times too.

Cindy R.,"Tacoma, WA",97,2,,5.0,5/6/2015,"Me, my wife, and my three daughters visited this last Friday, the 1st of May. Our hostess wasn't very chatty, but our server, Cindy, is by far, the best  server we have ever had...and we et out twice a week. The food id usually top notch, but even if there is a problem, she goes out of her way to make it right. I see her FLYING around while others are staring at their phones , or socializing with one another. My wife and I come back regularly, and most of the time will not stay if Cindy is not or server. My children LOVE her, she is CONSISTENTLY smiling, and she treats every single one of us with respect.

Steven H.,"Buckley, WA",0,18,,1.0,4/27/2015,"Service seems fine, except the manager seems unengaged with his customers opinions.

This one had one piece of floppy lettuce and no tomatoes and the fries were way to salty we couldn't eat many   waitress didnt come check on us till I was half done with my burger.

MacKenzie M.,"Federal Way, WA",1,8,,2.0,9/15/2014,"Yikes...not coming here again. As someone who works in the food industry (bartend/server) I understand how ""things happen"" and know that customer service is a HUGE priority. This place sadly lacks that. Walked in to see one hostess sitting down, and the one managing their desk didn't say hi or greet us....just gave us a blank stare. We (my mother and I) sat in the bar and were also given a blank and cold greeting by the bartender. Does anybody smile?! I understand sometimes ya don't want to go to work but WOW, everyone just looks absolutely miserable and made us feel like a burden coming in to make THEM money. Food was decent - so at least the kitchen helped give this 2 stars or else I'd give one (or zero if it was possible). Aside from that, the manager in glasses was pleasant and was seen helping out running drinks and bringing food :) which is always appreciated. They weren't busy though, barely even halfway full. But.....now I understand why. usually tip 30%+ (TIP KARMA...HELLO), but definitely only left maybe 15% just because.

Lynette A.,"Bonney Lake, WA",2,7,,2.0,12/13/2017,"I truly don't know if these reviews  do anything.  But here i go.  My husband ang i came into the bonney lake red Robin  for a late dinner.  9:15 pm.  Being gluten free there were few items that i could order.  One being the clam chowder.  The waitress brought mine, which was thick, but cold, and my husband's was watered down and cool. The waitress informed us that if we didn't like it we could get more. I tried mine, which was cold. I sent it back to warm it up. She didn't cone back with it. I questioned where it was. She threw it out. Never telling us that once it left the table  they can't put it in the microwave. I questioned her again about the soup and she snapped at me and said, I'll get my manger,""i don't have to be talked to like that"". Are you kidding me?  Guess we stop going to this red Robin. Gosh, where's the good service anymore.? It's not even closing time. Before wee even ordered they asked if we were going to have dessert because they were closing the ice cream machine down.  Are they open until 10 or what?  The manager took over our service. But we won't be coming here. I don't need to be treated like that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bonney-lake

Coryn S.,"Puyallup, WA",0,12,3,1.0,2/20/2017,"Absolutely filthy establishment and food was luke warm.  My son and I were at Marshalls close by and I could tell he was starving. I thought some Red Robin would be a treat for both of us... it wasn't. Let me break it down for y'all.  Icky #1- our table was so sticky that when I sat my purse down and then tried lifting it back up it made a squeaking/ripping sound. I thought the bottom of my purse ripped off.  Icky #2-The menus had food on them. (totally gross). We want to eat your food, that's why we came. But don't want to accidentally eat the food on the bloody menus!! They were sticky as well.  Icky #3-The kiosk/game unit on our table also had food on it along with fingerprints everywhere. Oh, it was sticky too. (Shocking, I know).  Icky #4-The blinds had about 1/4"" thick of dust and you could see someone had put their hands on them leaving their prints. I dunno about you, but stuff like that sure makes me hungry! (It doesn't actually) Icky #5-The table to the left of us was disgusting. The chairs had crap all over them as did the pole to the table. Very unsightly.  Icky #6- My sons high chair was also filthy. Everything was sticky!!! There were crumbs on the seat. Common now.  Point is, Bonney Lake Red Robin is filthy. Gross. Gag worthy. Be prepared for stickiness. Oh, and the food sucked. It was mostly luke warm. If the establishment is that filthy, what does the kitchen look like?!! I've seen reality tv with Gordon Ramsey man. Some places get away with filth murder!! The health department may need to take a look here.  The Puyallup Red Robin seems way better than this one. Go there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bonney-lake
Janea J.,"Honolulu, HI",13,25,11,3.0,8/11/2017,Jaw dropped at consistently needing to wait 15 to 20 mins to be seated every time I visit for dinner. The burgers are pretty decent and fairly priced. Bottomless fries are what's up!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bonney-lake
Kevin I.,"Kent, WA",0,2,1,1.0,6/27/2016,"It always seems to like spinning a roulette wheel when eating here. My girlfriend and I have started wagering on the outcome. Rude host/hostess? Dirty table? Non-existent server? Will they get your hopes up by promising a refill of your beverage and not delivering? Wrong or incorrect food? Food that comes out looking like it was mauled by a bear? Charged for a different table's order? It seems like almost every time is something different. Sometimes we get real lucky and get 2 or 3 of those in a single trip. Jackpot! This last time I think I was the lucky recipient of an edgy new plating style. I hear distressed jeans are all the style with the kids these days, and paying for jeans that already look like they have been extensively worn is all the rage. I think Red Robin is breaking new ground by going with 'distressed' plates, where the plates look like they have already been eaten off of and they just put down your food onto the previously-used plate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bonney-lake
Bill V.,"Bonney Lake, WA",56,3,1,2.0,8/18/2017,Ordered online. Only gave us half of the order.  Had to go back.

Rebekah H.,"Sumner, WA",50,20,5,1.0,5/30/2017,"So usually I like Red Robin's, but every time my husband and I have tried this specific Bonney Lake one it has never been a good experience. I figured after 3 crappy outings, it was time to post a review. In the past we've gone during somewhat busy times and have copped up our bad experience to their business. However, there was no excuse this time. We went on a Monday afternoon and arrived at 2:50PM so that we could enjoy their 3PM happy hour. Not only was our food lukewarm, but both batches of fries we received were burned. There was only 3 or 4 other people eating, and we still couldn't hear the waitress because she was talking too softly. At the end of eating our meal looking at the receipt only 1 of our 4 items were marked at happy hour prices. When we told the waitress, she told us prices were automated at time entered into the register. This wouldn't have bugged me so much except for the fact that we had told our waitress we were here for happy hour and ordered strictly from the happy hour menu. We would have happily waited a couple more minutes, or even if she had mentioned that these would be full price for another 10 minutes, I would have understood.  We ended up just paying it and probably won't come back to this specific one. There simply isn't any excuse for the over done food or the crappy service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bonney-lake

Lauren S.,"Kent, WA",3,37,1,1.0,8/28/2016,"Hmm, moving to Bonney Lake, impression of the Red Robin here not so grand.  My daughter and I were seated at a dirty table.  Infront of the hostess I asked her to not stick her hands in the mess; the hostess then put her menu in the nasty mess.  There was a clean table next to ours .. Epic fail, required improvement.  We ordered a Coke and Rootbeer.  They came and my daughter told me the Rootbeer tasted bad. Mommy taste and mommy approved.. Rootbeer was missing syrup so it tasted like flat diet pop. My Coke was the same. I pushed the drinks to the corner of the table and assumed in 5 min someone would stop by.. Wrong again. Epic fail #2.  An employee can stand in the entry to the kitchen drinking a cup of coffee; but we can't get service. Hmm, this is turning out to be a waste of my time and money.   We got our food. My fries were hot until you got pat the top ones then they were barely Luke warm. Annoyance level increases. But I had to send my drinks back after my food was delivered. So much for an easy snack/lunch.  Got our drinks back Rootbeer fine, Coke terribly diluted no syrup. I mean taste it yourself before you bring it to a customer.  The waitress was kind ... But it doesn't make up for all the other issues.   We were also sat under a fan that was going full speed. It's sweatshirt weather today. The hostess mentioned it was cold and she would look at turning it off but then never followed through.  Am I going to have to drive to another City for Red Robin. Hashtag discouraged.

Waited 30 minutes for my family's food to arrive only to have everything come to us at different times. They also had our orders mixed up! Our server was rude and arrogant and never came around to check on our table throughout our meal. My children wanted dessert, so we used the little monitor on the table to call our server. It flashed red for some time where it was ignored by every server passing. Needless to say, my kids never got dessert, just like we never got a thank you from our server for dining with them that evening.

Marvin T.,"Tacoma, WA",34,34,78,4.0,7/27/2016,"It had been at least two years since we had eaten at Red Robin. I give the food a three-star and service 4 star  After our son's doctors appointment we decided to stop in for lunch. This location is actually quite smaller than some of the other red robins that we have been to in the past, but we were able to get seated right away. There have been some significant menu changes. For appetizers we started with a delicious poutine , which doesn't seem to be served in a lot of restaurants around here. Poutine is essentially french fries drizzled with gravy and in this case came with sliced mushrooms and deep fried mozzarella cheese curds. Portion size, however for $9 seemed on the small side. I ordered the crab cake Burger, which was on the seasonal menu. Excellent crab flavor, however the mayo type dressing on the burger was on the sweet side for me. The dessert was delicious but decadently chocolate. These were their brownie sticks that where dipped in chocolate and drizzled with sea salt. It came with a raspberry dipping sauce, which to me tasted too much like watered-down raspberry jelly. I liked the dessert without the sauce.  Service here was excellent. Our waiter was attentive and kept our drinks refilled.

We used to go for our birthdays, family gatherings, sometimes date nights, etc etc. This Red Robin establishment is a joke. When we first moved to Bonney Lake two years ago, the food was good and fresh. Now every time we go is worse than the last time. We finally hit a point where we refuse to come back after waiting a ridiculous amount of time to pick up an online order, having their bratty manager roll her eyes at us when we expressed our frustration at waiting so long when all we were looking for was an apology, and then opening up our order to find burned burger patties on soggy buns. YUCK. Red Robin, you need totally new staff here or you'll continue to lose customers. And fire your manager. Her reaction to our (completely justified) frustration was ridiculous and extremely unprofessional. Thankfully the Red Robin in Federal Way is much better tasting and better run than this absolute nightmare.

Olivia W.,"Renton, WA",0,5,1,2.0,4/12/2015,"I went here with my boyfriend, my father, and his girlfriend yesterday (April 11th, 2015) for a late lunch around 3:00PM. I have been to this location a few times before and I've never been real impressed to be completely honest. The service and food are always very mediocre. There is no 'real entrance' like all of the other Red Robin restaurants I have been to. I swear the servers there are taught to ignore people who would like more bottomless fries. The one thing I do like is that they let adults order off of the kid's menu. I do not eat much, so it's nice to be able to pay for what I'll eat even though its a kid's meal. The actual location of this restaurant is good because its in the heart of Bonney Lake in a complex with a Famous Footwear, a Verizon, and a Bright Now Dental. Something I also found interesting is that I don't think I saw one male server while I was there. They were all younger females. Like most other Red Robin's, it was not a real quiet place. It's great for a kid's birthday dinner/party or a affordable family dinner, but I wouldn't say it's a great place for a nice first date. Also, this particular location is on the small side compared to other Red Robin's that I have been to. A lot of the times I'll see a group of teenagers that use it more as a hangout spot. I usually like Red Robin, but I do not think I will return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bonney-lake?start=80

Our server was less than friendly and got my sons order wrong but did nothing more than udder a sorry.  As far as the salads go $12 for a bagged ice burg lettuce mix with slimy chicken is just gross.

We finally got seated, ordered, food was good.  Two of us overheard a busboy say "" did you notice how quiet it got once they got their food?"" Twice. Mind you none of us were drinking alcohol, we were just visiting.  When we went to leave my friend spoke to the hostess and reminded her of her offer of free appetizers and the fact that we didn't get them.  She asked if we had told our waitress. No, didn't think we had to. ""it must have been a miscommunication between the manager and the waitress"" (blame game). She also told her that it was a little rude overhearing the busboys comments to 2 different staff. Again excuses, ""are you sure he was talking about you?""

We ordered small appetizers and we got over charged. We spoke to the manager patrick and he brought is new fries and new soup and gave us a discount. Which was nice of him however we were still over charged for an appetizer. Which we ordered a $5 order of boneless chicken wings with BBQ sauce and we got buffalo wings. We ate them because we were hungry. When we checked out I confronted the waitress about being over charged and she said she would take it off but she didn't. Needles to say we wont be coming back to this red robin location. Got a message from their customer service on the 9th of this month after my review.

Second, whoever the girl was in the pink quarter-sleeve shirt who was his supervisor or manager or whatever (I want to say her name was Nicole?) needs some serious one on one with someone who can teach her good customer service, because her awful attitude and constantly sour face made me nervous about asking her for anything. My fiancé asked Jason if it was okay if we could switch from fries to broccoli as our side after the first round; something we didn't think was that big of a deal. Well, according to pink shirt, that ""we don't really do that"" in a snotty tone, to which Jason tried to tell her it was okay and she snapped at him. Which, by the way, she was barking orders at Jason the entire night and acting extremely unprofessional.
