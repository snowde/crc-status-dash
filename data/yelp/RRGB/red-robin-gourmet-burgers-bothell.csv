Don N.,"Seattle, WA",24,26,4,3.0,9/25/2017,"Food here is fine--typical chain experience, and I like a few of the burger and sandwich options. Also can't beat bottomless fries, if that's a thing for you. Where Red Robin locations either excel or fall short is on the service experience, and this location in Bothell is all over the map on service. We've experienced some pretty amazing service now and then, but more often, the experience is just MEH. Middle-of-the-road at best, but often bordering on indifferent. Our most recent experience was on the lower end of the scale. We were seated for about ten minutes before our server appeared--seemed like our table wasn't in his actual section, but he'd been assigned to us maybe because the restaurant was slower that day and they were doing a round-robin type of thing on assigning servers to tables instead of seating people in each server's section. When our server did stop by, the initial experience was fine, with the usual ordering of drinks and food, but that's where things slipped fully into MEH mode. We saw our server just twice more after that, when he stopped by to check on drink refills and clear plates and later to drop off our check. He was phased shortly after that and didn't bother to stop at our table to tell us he was leaving and/or if anyone else would be checking on us. It was purely chance that I saw him leave the restaurant so I knew he was done for the day. The restaurant itself is generally clean, but if you look closely at the ledges beneath the shutters they use to divide the entry space from the dining room, you'll see a layer of dust that indicates some surfaces may not have seen a cleaning (or even a quick wiping down) in at least many days and possibly weeks or months. We've never had a problem with food quality here, and the service issues haven't required a direct discussion with management, nor have they affected our tipping. But we never come to this location with an expectation of an all-around excellent experience, it's typically a pretty functional visit to have a meal because we're hungry and Red Robin sounded good or was convenient for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bothell
Jenny B.,"Kenmore, WA",13,42,4,2.0,11/17/2017,"It's Red Robin. You get your typical burger, brew & fry experience in a laid-back environment. However, in this particular location, the staff just doesn't seem interested in making your visit memorable, it seems like they just want to get through their shift. It's not particularly fast service, the bottomless fries come with just a dozen fries each time. I suppose that's prudent on their part (money-saving), but it comes across as cheap. Maybe the first serving could be larger, then scale back on the serving size. Also, when travelling with the little kids, always deliver their food first, no matter if the rest of the table's order is complete, or at least ask if that's what the adults prefer. The restroom was not clean, and I hate that there was only a single soap dispenser on the wall for both sinks. That means if you use the far sink you have to wait for the other person at the other sink to move out of the way before you can finish washing your hands.  There are better Red Robins to visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bothell
Miss Mel D.,"Seattle, WA",7,28,2,1.0,1/1/2018,"I used to love Red Robin, but no longer. The service was so slow, it took forever to get our meal. Our server came realizing the food was taking long and offered to bring us fries. We were offered sauces with our fries and then were charged .75 cents a piece for them. Over-priced for a tiny piece of meat inside our bun even after being told the specialty burgers we ordered were supposed to be bigger than normal burgers on the menu. We split two burgers and my husband was like where's the meat? We ordered medium well and it came out over done and crispy. Then the manager proceeded to the table behind us and profusely apologized for the slowness and gave them a discount, but we were not treated the same. Our server was friendly and have nothing against her. I feel bad for the table of 20 that came in as we were leaving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bothell
Jessica H.,"Bothell, WA",1,79,10,1.0,12/16/2017,"Ordered a BLTA to go with no turkey or bacon. They still charged me the same price even though I asked for no meat. Usually other restaurants charge less if you omit meat. Then to top it all off, the avocados in my sandwich were rotten and I had to pick them off! I called and complained and was told I would receive a gift card in the mail. I have received nothing. It is completely unacceptable to serve rotten food to customers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bothell
Manwinder G.,"Mountlake Terrace, WA",0,6,,1.0,1/1/2018,"My husband and I love Red Robin, however, we came across a terrible experience at the Bothell Red Robin. My husband asked for the beef patty to have no pink and we get a beef patty that is fully pink. We called them up as we ordered the food to go, to tell them the beef patty was totally raw and the person who answered the phone, Ben, laughed at us and was utterly rude. We asked to speak to the manager who apologized, but that is horrible customer service. On top of that, I ordered the clucks and fries, and immediately after eating them I threw up and was sick for 4 days straight. Had to go to the doctor and found out I had severe food poisoning from the clucks and fries. We will never be going back to this location ever again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bothell
Kimberly R.,"Canyon Park, Bothell, WA",38,1,,2.0,12/20/2017,"Normally I really like going to Red Robin. Not today. I understand that you should expect a bit of a wait if there is a large party at the same time. However, it should never take 1.5 hours to get a burger and a kids Mac n' cheese. Having to ask 3 times for the birthday boys milkshake was rediculous, the blank stare with no response was disturbing. We were left wondering if it would ever show up. Once the table next to us started arguing over weather or not to leave before they got their food, I realized it wasn't just me with a bad experience. Probably won't be coming back to this Red Robin in the extended future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bothell
Jimmy B.,"Bellevue, WA",19,312,125,4.0,3/14/2017,"Consistently good burgers.   My usual fare is the value priced Reds Tavern Double which also comes with bottomless fries.  Top that off with a 50-50 mix of Mannys and Mac & Jack's makes it the perfect bar meal.   Although they no longer have the spicy chicken sandwich on the menu, they're more than happy to prep it for you.   I also suggest the BLTA Croissant Sandwich, so tasty!  I've found all the Red Robin's to be very accommodating for large groups, and still offer premium service.   Large parking lot is a plus, but it can get a little crowded around dinner and weekends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bothell
Mimi N.,"Seattle, WA",681,434,2259,4.0,7/8/2016,"Typically, most RR places that I go to are often a hit or miss. I will say, this location was a hit :)  Came here with a party of seven and we got seated promptly without much wait on a Friday during lunch. Our server was quite attentive and overall, provided great service to our party. Table was clean, water was always filled and it was nice to munch on a basket of fries while we waited for the food.  When we did receive our food, it was hot and fresh. Another win win since usually, I get lukewarm to cold food at other locations. I like my whiskey wrap and it served to be a nice food coma afternoon.  Definitely will swing by here again for future lunches.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bothell
Jenny C L.,"Bothell, WA",81,21,36,4.0,8/17/2017,"Now that we have kids, we tend to go to family friendly restaurants. Kids can grab a red balloon by the entrance, always a plus as it keeps them entertain for a bit during dinner. We prefer Bothell location as it's much cleaner and newer. Other locations, (Bellevue square) the floors and high chairs are sticky, my shoe literally sticks on the floor but that's for another review.  As for thrashers corner Bothell, the servers are nice and checks up on us pretty frequent, making sure we have enough fries, sauces etc. I love the mushroom burger, you can also substitute sides if you rather have sweet potatoes or a salad! BLTA crossiant sandwich is another fav. They have a good variety for kids meal, from burgers to mac and cheese, chicken strips, mini corn dogs etc, and they come with a drink or Kids can upgrade to milkshake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bothell
Tana R.,"Chicago, IL",90,221,229,4.0,6/16/2017,"Even though I typically do not prefer eating in chain restaurants, I'm quite a fan of this one. It's because these restaurants can please anybody - from a huge meat fan to vegans and their menu is full of goodies. As a pescatarian, I really appreciate having an option to turn any burger into vegetarian or vegan one. You can literally create your own delicious burger. I love that!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bothell
Denise W.,"Redmond, WA",38,163,660,4.0,4/21/2016,"This place is a hit or miss as far as service goes. Just depending on how busy they are. I think more training or more staff is needed to handle the crowd.  I always get the whiskey chicken sandwhich and my husband some type of cheeseburger. I love how moist the chicken breast is. Everytime I order my sandwhich as a wrap the kitchen staff does a great job of wrapping the chicken in at least two layers of iceberg lettuce because they know one layer is a little too thin.  My husband likes his cheeserburgers. A burger that's in between Mcdonalds and John Howie. Especially when you're hungry, it'sthe most amazing burger or sandwhich. If you don't fill your stomach with the burger or sandwhich you also get bottomless fries. All the French fries your heart desires. The price of a burger or sandwhich is around $11-$15 makes it a good value.  Join the loyalty program. Every 10th item free and free birthday burger.  This is my go to place for America food that won't break the bank.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bothell
Deanna H.,"Lake Stevens, WA",141,205,1169,4.0,4/26/2016,"Great server (named Jesse) and good food.  I like being able to run in,  grab drinks,  appetizers,  or lunch,  and have fast service.

Andy R.,"Seattle, WA",6,10,1,1.0,11/4/2017,"My 4 year old son and I came here tonight after the trampoline park, so he was hungry.  I totally understand how busy a Red Robin is around 7 on a Saturday night.  20 minute wait, no big deal.  Take a while to greet us and bring us waters and silverware, ok.  Food finally arrives and forget our sauces, still happy.  I always ask for more fries right when they bring the food, since they only give you 5-7 fries to begin with and they know you will ask for more.  This is where I get angry.  Let's just say 30 minutes goes by (not joking) and we still don't have more fries.  I had asked 3 severs for them during that 30 minutes.  I even paid on that silly computer they have on the table that does 60% of their job for them.....still no fries.  Finally my original server arrives to say the kitchen is really backed up, but he knows we want more fries and is working on it.   Too late!  I'm pissed.  My suggestion is to either give people enough fries to begin with or hire a guy who's sole purpose is to cook fries all night.  If I hadn't manually paid on the self serve computer I would've asked for the tip back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bothell
Erica P.,"Seattle, WA",88,184,994,1.0,11/21/2015,"Utterly disappointing. Came in at 1:30 for a birthday family birthday lunch at the request of the lovely birthday girl. Right off the bat, service was slow. It took quite a bit of time before we got our drinks; and when the waiter brought them, he delivered everyone's drink except mine (which was on the tray) and then proceeded to start taking food orders. My husband had to reach over and get my drink off of the serving tray while our server was at the other end of the table. As we were a large party and wanted several separate checks, the waiter made a point to have us order based on the grouping of the checks vs where we sat at the table, to avoid any confusion.  The food took AGES to come out. We did not order anything extraordinary. No special requests or substitutions. 10 adult meals and 2 kids meals. We specifically requested for the kids meals to come out as soon as they were up in the window because our kids eat slow, and also because they were super hungry. We do this almost everywhere we go and we've never had a problem. Today, it was well over 25 minutes between placing our order and receiving the kids meals, despite our server assuring us that he would bring their meals out quickly. 10 minutes after that, the adult meals came out. The manager stopped by to offer a token apology for how long our food was taking telling us thay about 6 parties came in at the same time, and wr just happened to be the last one in, so basically we got the short end of the stick. The food was cold. It was very obvious that our plates had sat in the window for quite some time. My mother in law and I ordered the french onion soup, which came out luke-warm. The cheese on top was so congealed that both of us had to saw through it with a knife. The BLTA croissant was bland, the croissant tasted stale, and the rest of the ingredients were just tasteless. Then came time to settle the bills. Two in our party received a bill which totaled five dollars and some change. When the server brought their receipt back for signature, they had been charged THIRTY SEVEN dollars. The manager again came by to tell them that because we had ""so many"" separate checks there had been a mix up. I call bs on that, because multiple separate checks does not explain how their first receipt was for 5 and change and the one they were presented to sign was over 37. The rest of us hadn't even asked for our checks yet as we were still plowing through our cold food. Once the rest of us got our checks, more drama ensued. Two in our group were using their rewards cards to cash in their free birthday meal. Our server came back and was VERY condescending and argumentative with the birthday folk who were trying to use their rewards.  Overall it just left a bad taste in my mouth. I consistently have terrible experiences at this location, yet we keep coming back, hoping it will be different. Frankly, I'm tired of it, and I'm pretty darn tired of Red Robin. The food is bland, the service is awful, and the prices keep going up. Not worth the time or effort.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bothell
Theresa W.,"Lynnwood, WA",0,6,,5.0,8/24/2017,"Best experience I have ever had at a Red Robin. Decided to go out to lunch chose this location because it was close to my work and it sounded good. On my way there I ran over something that just so happened to get stuck under my car. It was super stuck. Went in ordered of course the waiter was great maybe his name D- Rex.... while eating the manager came by asked how everything was and I mentioned my car and the thing being stuck, he asked for us to go check it out. He got on the ground and crawled under my car and pulled it out! Thanks so much Andy not many people would do that!!!

Krystle G.,"Lynnwood, WA",118,34,4,4.0,4/25/2017,"We had pretty good service last night. Total bill $49. My husband liked his bacon burger and I had the avocado burger with sweet potato fries.

Alex G.,"Redmond, WA",105,76,8,3.0,2/22/2016,"We rolled into this dirty bird on a Sunday afternoon, and sat ourselves in the bar. Both the husband and I are well-versed in their menu and are generally ready to order as soon as we walk in. This location was either understaffed or people were out of their section, as it took almost 7min to get a menu tossed onto our table (without being acknowledged, while the waitress was talking over her shoulder to a coworker), and then another 5min for her to come back and take our order. Not a huge deal, just enough to be unsettling. Husband was distracted the entire time by Planet of the Apes/Cougartown (such a strange combo..)  playing on the tvs behind me.  Food arrived just after we both started to wonder where it was at, and both entrees were hot and tasty. My portion of the bottomless fries was a little sad, but I'll live. Waitress came by once more during this process to ensure we knew how to check out using their tableside tablet before disappearing.  Meh on service and food was the standard.

They forgot the milkshake which made us have to go back after driving away. The California Chicken burger had soggy lettuce and brown guacamole.  Very little fries were added and what was included appeared to be hours old. The sad kids meals were atrocious.  The so called chocolate milk was warm milk in a plastic cup with unstirred chocolate syrup at the bottom.

Plus the place wasn't even at half capacity or busy. When the waiter finally came he was super dismissive and again acted like I was a burden.

It's unacceptable to do a bait and switch on the burger when you are charging $14 for it. It's unacceptable to make people wait so long for their lunch.

Went on Friday 21rst and must have been a off night my Royal burger didn't taste like it always has. Same with the wifes burger she said was just ok not as good as she has before. My drink was always kept full without saying anything not this time, probably the first time this has happened. The fries well over cooked and hard. Not happy spent 80.00 dollars with drinks hardly any booze in my wifes drink but my daughter's drink was good. Its like we lost a good friend that always came thru.

We were seated in a booth but it didn't feel like one and we were surrounded by a weird ambience that I didn't enjoy-- near the front so we saw all the employees and every person who walked in and in just an awkward place in the restaurant. We started ordering our food and at first, our server seemed very nice however my friend wanted to try one of the lemonades and the server made it sound like she'd just get a refill of another choice if she ended up not liking the new flavor she was trying. Needless to say, she tried making it seem as if that refill would be free but it wasn't and that ticked us off. Secondly, we waited for our food for a good 30-40 minutes and when it came out, it was BARELY warm; my fries were cold that I ended not even eating them.

There was a group of four sitting a few tables down in our section that had already been served, but other than that no other people in our section.  It took forever for Stacy, our server, to come over and get our drink order. I'm talking a good 10 minutes, which I didn't understand considering the scarce amount of patrons in the building. Stacy had to be retrieved by our hostess from the kitchen area. Stacy then wandered to an area behind us, no food in tow, then meandered her way to our table. We ordered our drinks, appetizer and food all at once seeing as we had enough time to review the menu multiple times. I always order the grilled cheese and specified after my last visit with this joint that I in fact did not need my sandwich cut in 12ths and that I would prefer not to have my sandwich on a child's plastic plate. Somewhere along the lines that request was lost in translation. The sandwich thankfully came out cut in half, but it was on a star wars plate. As a 35 year old woman I will pass on the cheap plates made for kids. My daughter counted her fries, she had 5. I think I had 8. Stacy never offered my daughter a refill on her lemonade and never once came back to find out how our meal was or to see if we wanted more fries. Typically I am a great tipper, as I too have been a server. It took everything I had to tip her 10%. Red Robin, get your stuff together and train your employees better. Every single time I walk into this particular Red Robin customer service is an issue. Furthermore our food tasted AWFUL tonight. My daughter refused to finish her grilled cheese.

It took 9 minutes from when we sat down to be acknowledged, which then we would have had to look at menu and spend more time before eating.  Fortunately we have come enough that we knew what we wanted and just ordered then.... 27 minutes later (and after seeing others get their food) my wife asked wth was going on.  We were told they had computer issues, and it was coming right out (computer issues I guess only impacted some)... Then the food comes out and my wife's is messed up (bun instead of lettuce wraps).  They leave the fries which she eats prior to getting her burger (only took like 5 minutes or so). My avo-cobb-o salad was great as always and the cup of chili was decent.  However waiting 45 late at night, when we are already hungry, for a salad and a simple burger was horrible. The manager came and apologized (he knew we were pissed) and my wife's burger was comped.  That was nice of them, but seriously it is the time that was the issue.

Devin F.,"Fall City, WA",0,2,9,4.0,12/24/2015,"Let me start by stating that I never give a place 5 out of 5 stars. Simply because I like to believe that there is always room for improvement in naturally, anything that we do. Have it be making food, eating food, ordering food, anything. Period.  However, my most recent experience with the Red Robin located in Canyon Park was probably the nearest to a 5 star worthy review. If you're not hip to the holiday season, it is Christmas Eve. I work about 2 miles away and my boss was kind enough to want to provide lunch for our department. Knowing that a lot of my coworkers intend to leave early today, we decided that placing a lunch order at 11 AM would be sufficient. Yet it was then that we realized that Red Robin opened at 11 AM. OH NO! End of the world right? Wrong. Like many normal business practices, this facility is already loaded with employees eager to work on Christmas Eve. I called at 10:45 (I can't help my military nature. 15 prior to the 15 prior, hurry up and wait mindset) and was patched through to the Bartender. I informed her that I needed to place a take out order for a total of 17 people. She then had me speak with the main attraction of this review, the Manager , Maddie. Maddie was very friendly, kind, and most importantly, attentive. This was as easy as ordering a pizza from a mobile app. As a prior food service team member, I understand the daily frustrations of the industry. From the complicated orders, to the pressure of reassuring the customer that you will make sure this is done right. I held all the faith in the world in Maddie and her team. About 15 minutes later I had realized that an order was forgotten and it was quickly addressed with little to no hesitation. ""No problem"" seemed to be the words of the day.  What was most helpful was that when it got down to my order..... Man did I panic. I like to think I have a good concept of what I want. But after reading all these orders from my fellow coworkers, I had done it again. I became that indecisive customer. You know the type... I asked Maddie what her favorite was, in hopes of finding something to appease my mind, and stomach. She mentioned that her 12 years with the company, although helpful; only made matters worse. We finally arranged the perfect formula. It was a Guac Burger with mushrooms. The happy medium. I know that her and I see differently on the mushroom topic, but she's ok in my book. I even made the contingency that Maddie would need to hire me part-time if this order was in any way incorrect. With confidence, she agreed. I am sad to say, that I will keep my day job, and my day job only. At this time, I will not have the pleasure of working for Maddie. It was by far, one of the best interactions I have ever had at a restaurant. She made it easy, exciting, and fun.  My co workers had no gripes with their orders and all seemed pleased with the food. The soggy fries are no fault of Red Robin's, but the drive is to blame. It happens. They were at least warm. The only thing I found to be unpleasant was when I went to pick up the food. As I sat at the bar with my coworker awaiting the numerous bags. A blonde female from the restaurant side came over and asked the bartender if the to-go order was going to at least leave a tip. She mentioned that 10 percent should be expected. Many may not have heard this, however; the battle tested, combat ears of this veteran, did. I was quick to announce that she need not worry. I too was in the food industry and have a decent amount of respect for my fellow human. Either way, she would not receive the tip anyway. So it boggles my mind. I joked casually with the bartender about the situation and she was a real good sport about it. Aside from that, it was great. So in short, here is my closing statement about this place....  I would battle a wild bear outside my local McDonalds, caged in the handicap stall, with my hands tied behind my back, with a shake-weight super glued to my forehead as my only weapon for a chance to share a meal over skype - on a dial up connection with the employees of this place.    Thanks again Maddie.

Brad H.,"Kirkland, WA",234,971,115,3.0,5/21/2014,"This is an interesting Red Robin to say the least. The store has a very small layout to it and really does not have the energy most Red Robins have. It is located next to a Fred Meyer's but not much else is nearby that would draw traffic. The service was quick and personable but the checkout process was slow. The serving size of french fries was way to small (granted they are bottomless, but you have to wait to have them cook them and deliver them--- aka a money maker as many will order more drinks--). Overall I would skip this Red Robin in the future, way to many dining choices near by that are a better value, but if your in the mood for Red Robin, go to Woodinville.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bothell?start=80

As a vegetarian, I appreciate that they have two different types of veggie burgers (garden and Boca) and that you can add any of the huge selection of toppings you want. I am a fan of the 5 alarm and the whiskey river styles. The onion straws are delicious as are the fried jalapenos.  They recently added hummus and sweet potato fries to their menu, which is a great touch. I give Red Robin a 5 because it reaches this standard: If anyone recommends Red Robin for lunch or dinner, I never say, ""no"" and always look forward to the meal.

Miranda C.,"Bothell, WA",0,17,,1.0,1/14/2014,"My friends and I stopped by here for dinner this evening. I ordered the Garden Burger with a Boca patty (because I dislike Gardenburgers), and we asked for our bill to be split two ways. The waitress said okay, and took our order.  When the food arrived, I noticed my burger had a Gardenburger patty, not a Boca. We had all ordered sauces on the side, and we only got one of them and ranch dressing (We didn't ask for Ranch.). They sent it back, and I received my Boca patty and we got our sauces. Not only was I unaware that it was a Boca because it looked exactly the same as the previous burger(Boca burgers are typically a dark brown), but it was very cold and oddly watery when I took a bite, so I sent it back again. I declined their offer to remake it or get me anything else since I have a bit of food-related anxiety and wanted to stick with something meatless. I was going to eat the fries, but they took those away as well as the burgers both times. From then on, the waitress ignored me and my other female friend. She brought a small basket of fries to the gentlemen at our table, and refilled only their water, despite me and my friend having less than half a glass each and theirs being nearly full. It seemed as if she knew she wouldn't get a tip from me and my friend (who was kindly covering my tab), so she was trying to get on our boyfriends' good sides. My friends noticed this, and we discussed it afterward. I always feel bad when I'm unable to tip, but I didn't feel as bad this time. She also did not split our tab as we had requested. We gave up, and just asked her to split it evenly between two of my friends, who were treating my boyfriend and me to dinner.  The star for the manager who was kind enough to inform me that they changed their patties a few months back and removed it from my friend's tab.

Andrew B.,"Bothell, WA",0,20,,1.0,10/17/2015,"Despite having several great experiences here in the past, today's visit was horrible. The host was highly unpleasant and very rude to my mother. There was food under my chair. The restaurant had underwent a remodel since we were there last and it has reduced the dining area into an even more tightly packed and uncomfortably hot eating area. The restaurant had, apparently, decided to reduce their wait staff in favor of new machines that allows either younger, or more knowledgeable, customers to order and pay from their table, with a credit card. This was a big issue for us as it took at least 20 to 25 minutes for someone to acknowledge and wait on us. The person wasn't our server, but cared enough to help. She apologized and explained that there was reduced staff that day, a fact our primary Waitperson enhanced when he pointed out the new machines. The only complaint about the two waitpeople's joint service was that neither brought us water. My mother's burger was a little bland and somewhat smaller then it used to be. My own burger seemed to be about .50 to .75 cents more then it used to be and was slightly underwhelming.  The Campfire sauce and onion rings were good as always. I may go to another Red Robin in the future in the hopes that it wasn't remodelled and forced to lay off experienced waitstaff in exchange for the so called 'convenience' of the tabletop machines.

The drinks seemed to be watered down. When you pay $5 for a beer, you really wouldn't expect it to be skunky and watered down right? The fries were still bad, maybe hire somebody with a G.E.D. instead of a 5th Grade Education, so they can read you have to cook fries for 5 minutes at 480 degrees, rather than cooking it for 500 seconds at 48 degrees. Who cooks the burgers? The newly hired 15 year old binge drinker that can't tell the difference between a man and a woman? Must be, when I asked for no lettuce, I get extra lettuce.
