Norma L.,"Cohasset, MA",0,8,,3.0,12/7/2017,Went in for a quick meal while shopping. Really like their salads and fries. The service here is slow not the waitresses fault I think she was the only one working our area.  The ladies room was filthy as well.  This place would be so much better if management got their act together and hired more servers!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree
Young P.,"Boston, MA",224,348,388,4.0,12/20/2017,"I actually really liked this place. A lot of burger options, appetizers, and great service.

April P.,"Boston, MA",25,68,81,4.0,6/13/2017,"*** if you're new to RR with their tablets, be advised of a possible (chump change) fee charge called ""entertainment fee"" if you use their tablet on the table *** This was my 3rd time at this location, when I entered the hostess asked me ""picking up?"" Which kind of bothered me because she made that assumption since I was alone, nowadays people eat alone SO NO, TABLE FOR ONE and proud. I always order the Simply Grilled Chicken sandwich with steak fries and a side of ranch. The waitress was fast and friendly with her service. I didn't know if my RR loyalty card was still active since I have not used it for years but she insisted to still try; good thing I did because my meal was free and only had to pay for my beverage! This visit was definitely better from the last 2 visits that were terrible, the host swapped our tablet on the table she gave which already had a charge of an ""entertainment fee,"" can't remember the fee but it was some change, but it would've been helpful if she informed us of this entertainment fee rather then giving us an already used/played tablet (you get charged for using their tablet of games I suppose). The 2nd visit we waited too long for refills of  our beverages and ""bottomless"" fries- which they only gave one basket for 2 parties that both had bottomless fries in their order.

Damien S.,"Boston, MA",2909,1678,3712,2.0,4/24/2017,"I like that Red Robin as a brand has grown up. Like, Brooklyn working professional kinda with a Chip & JoJo design aesthetic. I like that they have a prosperous loyalty program, and the winning concept of bottomless steak fries. I like the flavored iced tea I don't like the food, unfortunately. Not a hatred - it wasn't bad or anything. It was actually fairly flavorless. Fries are undersalted and cool on delivery. Big Ghost Tavern Burger ($11) is billed as one spicy punch to the tongue hole, yet sits woefully bland in spite of the various promised chiles in the mix. I don't like the sign-up process for the above mentioned loyalty program. You can do it from the pay immediately terminal which sits at every table, ready to distract your kids with cartoons (for a price), your teenager with games (for a price), or your significant other with a button to order complimentary refills (hey, it's free!). As with many tech advancements to help streamline a process, the paper jammed and took six times as long to rectify as handing our server a credit card. Beer and wine on the menu. The squish liked his Grilled Cheezy - kids meals run ~$4. I wouldn't not return, per se; I'm just not in a rush to suggest another shot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree

Bottomless fries and drinks and yummy food was just the tip of the iceberg. My son is  training and so the bathroom is now playing a part of the review.  Bathroom  was clean and not as scary as the mall.  Food was good and I would recommend to anyone. Service was good and parking was easy.

Jhonn P.,"Boston, MA",0,4,1,1.0,10/18/2017,"I was pretty excited to go to this place because of all of the hype. Once I got to the Red Robin in the Braintree MA location I was so disappointed . Upon walking in I was not greeted nor was I asked whether I was ready to be seated. Once I finally managed to get somebody's attention, they grabbed the menus in the most absurd way. They grabbed them and proceeded to take us to the table while giving us the rudest attitude I've witnessed at a restaurant. She tossed the menus on the table and walked away.   As if this wasn't enough, once we sat down we were really upset at the service given and just decided to do take out. Once again, we went on a search for the host who seated us. Once we found her , she gave us an attitude when we told her we wanted take out instead, instead of telling us where to go , she just walked away. It was not until I found a waiter to ask her where to get our food and she took our order. Overall, an absolutely terrible experience and I will NOT be coming back to this place. The waiter Hailey was nice though , it was the host that ruined everything for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree
Garrett Y.,"Milton, MA",190,312,987,3.0,5/14/2016,"The food here is decent. My nephews wanted to come here for lunch and I had been meaning to check this place out. My sister likes this place for the bottomless fries. The restaurant is located in South Shore Mall, so parking was pretty tight Saturday afternoon. We checked in and were seated promptly. We had a booth in the corner, which was a perfect location as I had three kids with me. The set up interesting. There is an electronic gadget that serves as entertainment (there are free and pay per play games, like trivia). My nephews ordered off of the children's menu. They had the chicken tenders with fries and the pasta and carrots. The tenders looked really good! The steak fries were good too as I had them with my burger. I had the guacamole and bacon burger, which was decent but was salty. I finally figured out after a few bites that it was the guacamole. I would probably not get this burger again. They also had a burger with ramen noodle buns; it looked tempting but also looked like a heart attack waiting to happen!! Service was decent. We got one round of bottomless fries and was asked if we wanted more (answer was no). The fries that come with the meals wasn't a lot and the refill wasn't a lot either. I would rather have larger full orders than smaller ones with refills. Anyway... I would come back but there are other and better burger choices around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree

Jen S.,"Brookline, MA",135,260,172,4.0,8/23/2016,"I know this is a chain and all, but this is my go to place for a burger. I'm not really a burger person, but I can't get enough of their Bleu ribbon! It comes on an onion bun with chipotle mayo, bleu cheese and onion straws. It's sooooooooo good. I tried their bonzai burger once, and it was ok, but I much prefer the flavors of the Bleu Ribbon. My husband has gotten a few different kinds and has liked all of them. I LOVE that they have bottomless fries. The seasoning is so good.  I have also had their Caesar's chicken wrap and their Chucks and fries. Both are fine.  MUCH prefer their burgers.  I was very glad when they came to South Shore. We had previously only gone to the location in Providence when we'd go to Once Upon a Child. So now we can go more often!  I really like this location. We have always been well taken care of. The staff is always so friendly! I'm so grateful for those tablets- they mostly keep our ToddlerMonster occupied. $1.99 (or $2.99? My memory fails me) well spent.  It's worth the wait if it's crowded.  I now want another Bleu ribbon! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree

No smile just an expression that gave an unwelcoming vibe. She seated us at the worst possible spot in the restaurant, next to the front door.  Food was subpar.

Daniel N.,"Boston, MA",213,110,159,5.0,6/24/2016,"I had heard the service here was really bad, so I wasn't surprised by the negatice/low reviews. However they must have read them and had a turn around because my last visit ran perfectly.  This was only my second time to a Red Robin, but I was honestly impressed by the menu - for a predominantly burger place the options were endless and looked spectacular! I ordered the really spicy burger (name escapes me) that came with ghost pepper sauce and jalapeños. I was pleasantly surprised that it was indeed spicy since most places that tout ghost pepper are usually meh. I was only able to get 1 extra side of the bottomless steak fries. I love their seasoning and am glad they supply a shaker bottle of it at each table! They also have bottomless steamed broccoli for those that are health conscious, a nice thought. As mentioned, the service was stellar, in fact borderline maybe a little too much. Only reason is that we had 2 servers helping us a time. Maybe one person was in training or our 1st server was at first helping out the 2nd and started us off, but we kept on getting repeat service like ""anything to drink? -no thanks we already ordered"" or ""want more fries? -nah she already came around and is getting it for us."" Honestly not a biggie, better to have more (and good) service than none (or bad) at all. This red robin uses the automated tableside systems in which you can immediately swipe your CC and bounce if you're in a rush.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree
Rob B.,"North Weymouth, North Weymouth, MA",0,4,,2.0,4/30/2017,"The food is subpar, that is if you get what you ordered. The half dozen times or so that I've been here have been purely for convenience. I understand it's a newer location for Red Robin, but I think the kitchen really needs to focus and so do the servers so that they know where the food is going to out on the floor. I can't tell you how many times I've ordered a ghost pepper burger and have gotten something completely different. Or have ordered a different burger and said I want it without tomatoes and I have gotten a completely different burger with tomatoes. There's nothing more annoying than sitting down and watching the people you came in with eat in front of you while you have nothing to do but wait for the right food to come out. I definitely think I won't be visiting this location anymore. But I have nothing but good things to say about their location in Plymouth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree
Lianne V.,"Quincy, MA",12,7,1,2.0,7/3/2017,Tonight we ordered a couple of to go burgers because we got back late from our honeymoon. When we got back home we opened up my husbands burger to find this pepper (we think) wedged on the top of the burger bun (didn't look that appealing to be honest). It was slimy and probably not fresh by the looks / feel of it. My burger was good and the salad was what I ordered but his salad was only a few pieces of lettuce and some dressing. :( We did order the food around 9:00 but they were still open for a full hour still - when we got there the staff seemed rushed to try to close up (this was around 9:40).

Michele A.,"Quincy, MA",103,10,,3.0,9/8/2017,"Came here for the first time with my mother. The hostess (brunette) was not at the host stand so I asked the bartender if he could seat us. The hostess actually walked past us without any regard as she saw us being seated by the bartender. Burgers/fries were status quo - as to be expected from a burger joint. The server was wonderful and checked in on us. My mother left her wallet and I called to make sure it was there. I went to go pick it up and my mother says that we should tip them if all of her money was accounted for. I went to pick it up, less than greeted by the hostess who brought my mother's wallet to me. As I was preparing to tip her for  handing me my mother's wallet, she just held her hand out as if expecting a tip and took it - without any good manners or push back with saying, ""I was just trying to do the right thing, no need for a tip."" A normal, good, genuine person would not have just stuck their hand out like this girl had done. I wish I would have thanked the server instead of the lazy hostess with the generous tip instead.

After work I wanted a burger that I had been craving for a few weeks... Pros:  - Our waitress was super nice and made sure we were okay.  - Location at the South Shore Plaza - Cool ordering system that took care of your order, bill and it even had games! Cons:  - It was freezing. I mean I get it. It's winter and it's cold out. But there was a draft in the restaurant and it was cold.  - Presentation of meals wasn't great. Plates were super greasy along the edges. They also got my sisters order wrong and she had to have it reordered.  - Fries were never refilled which was odd.  - Tables were sticky and seats were crumby. It felt like I was at a sonic.

Kat B.,"Dorchester, MA",542,57,213,4.0,1/29/2016,My first time here yay!!! The food was great service was impeccable Jason was our server he was a great joy and met all of our needs. He was also the only one on the floor and did a good job serving the other tables BUT down side hence why I have to give 4 stars is they should of had another server with him especially since it was lunch time. It was a little hard getting him when he was on his missions but always checked in with us.  The burger I got was the whiskey without the BBQ sauce subbed peppercorn spread with a turkey burger IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!!  My aunt had the southern I believe with arugula with some sauces on the side.  Sides were fries and broccoli.

Tracey L.,"Quincy, MA",8,83,162,3.0,10/30/2015,"New location at South Shore Plaza, where Legal Sea Foods used to be. We were greeted by a very friendly hostess. They have a cool system where you put your name down and they ask for your number so they can send a text when your table's ready. You can also check where you are in line.  When we got the text, we were seated at the bar, which I wasn't really fond of as I prefer sitting at a table. I think they should ask in advance if it's okay to seat people at the bar. As expected, service at the bar wasn't as quick and attentive. Although the waitress/bartender was nice enough she was was clearly busy. We decided to go with the a small order of buffalo wings (buzz sauce), Whiskey River BBQ and Fiery Ghost Tavern burgers.  The wings didn't come with any dipping sauce. My whiskey burger was pretty good; decent size and filling. My bf said his burger wasn't very spicy even though it had jalapeños in it. The steak fries that came with it were fine, not as crisp as I would've liked, but you can get as many refills as you like. You can get ""premium sauces"" if you prefer something other than ketchup with your fries. I ordered the garlic aioli, which was pretty good.  I think they're still working out some kinks since they just opened a few days ago. We had several waiters stop by with other tables' orders. Overall the visit satisfied my burger cravings.

Julie G.,"South Weymouth, MA",0,1,,1.0,11/17/2016,"I love Red Robin and have eaten at many locations but this one has consistently given poor quality food, frequently over cooking the burgers even when specifically asking for them to be careful with that. I would not recommend going to this restaurant. I have tried to give this location multiple opportunities hoping they had a slow learning curve after opening. However, I have yet to see any improvement and will not be back.  Red Robin is a great restaurant...just not this location.

Debra C.,"Braintree, MA",0,8,,1.0,5/11/2017,"Went here for lunch with daughter and two young children. Server was efficient, but my double burger on a gluten free roll was horrendous. Roll was so hard I couldn't even bite into it. Each burger patty was tasteless and dry. Waitress brought roll to manager and took that extra charge off bill.  When waitress came back, I told her how awful the meat was (tried to eat without roll). Both waitress and manager came over and offered something else, but having two fussy children doesn't afford the luxury of waiting again. Manager fully took off of check and gave me his card to come back for a free burger another time. Might have given it a thought until I came home and found a 1.99 entertainment charge on bill. There are tablets on tables that, without notice, they must charge if used. Having children with us, of course they use.  I don't recall seeing anything posted or displayed showing potential charges.

Don't bother going in and wasting your time.  1 Artic Cod Burger and 1 Royal Red Robin Burger. 2 Unsightly regretful fails.  The Royal Red Robin: the meat is not seasoned whatsoever!! I understand that salt and pepper on the table, but seriously, why did they not even season it. My burger was so bland. The egg was cooked to a completely hard yolk and it was unsightly. I ate 1/2 of my burger and that was it. I felt like I wasted my calories (lol).  The artic cod burger was ridiculously brown and it was flavorless. My friend just ate the meat on the inside of the burnt batter. This burger comes with coleslaw and not lettuce as it said so  maybe just dont trust the descriptions.

Maureen W.,"Milton, MA",1,5,,1.0,2/27/2016,"One star for our waitress Sam who was the only highlight of my visit to Red Robin last night. She was great- attentive and fast. We did have to wait 15 minutes for someone to come to our table but based on our service after, I feel like that may have been due to miscommunication of who was taking the table.  We get to our table and have no idea how this restaurant works. Are there even servers? Or do you order just from the iPad type thing. I go to the host stand and the woman immediately solves the whole ""no waitress"" issue. I forgot, she also was very helpful and attentive. So one star for the waitress and hostess.  0 stars for the food. We ordered the pretzel bites and they were dry and too hard. My boyfriend described the cheese sauce as microwaved Tostitos queso dip. Very artificial tasting. The burger was ok but the food at patriots place just tastes a lot better.  The thing is, being a waitress myself, I am definitely not hard to please. I can definitely sympathize! I can only imagine what happens in this place when more ""particular"" customers come in. Maybe in a few months if the reviews improve I'll revisit, but if I'm fixing for Red Robin, I'm going straight to Foxboro.

Linda T.,"Dorchester, Boston, MA",16,38,32,2.0,1/3/2016,"Have always wanted to try Red Robin's because of their catchy commercials! Red Robins Yum! I have very mixed feelings about my experience. I absolutely loved my burger! I ordered the southern charm burger. It was oozing with delicious tangy honey bbq sauce that wasn't too overpowering and topped with delicious candied bacon! That was the only good part of my dining experience.            The first thing I noticed that was off was our waiters..the fact that we had two different waiters who clearly didn't know they were both serving us. And I noticed there weren't too many other diners so I don't know why the service was so slow, even with our two confused waiters. We found ourselves having to constantly use the little electronic device on our table to call our waiter.        The second thing that really bugged me was how dirty the dishes and utensils were. I'm sure even if we weren't sitting directly under one of their light fixtures we would still be able to see how dirty everything was. I would think a new establishment would be pretty good with not grossing out so many new customers. But no lol. I could write my name in the unidentified stains on my plate.        We got the chocolate fruffles for dessert and was once again grossed out.

Jason G.,"Abington, MA",49,163,4,3.0,11/13/2015,"We went here for lunch on a holiday weekday. There was a decent crowd, but plenty of available tables. Our son was with us and he needs a high chair. I thought we would be say right away, but the hostess told us there was a 15 minute wait. I looked around at the various empty tables and booths and wondered if perhaps they were sections with no wait staff coverage at that time of day. Instead, as we are waiting I saw another party walk in from the mall entrance and be sat immediately. I went over to the hostess just to check-in and ask if there was still a wait. She said there was still a 15 minute wait and then lied that those people were on the list.  Once we finally got a table, which didn't require a party leaving, since there were plenty of tables available, we got to try the food. We started with the pretzel bite appetizer. It was okay, though they do not give enough dipping sauce. The burgers were fine, but nothing to write home about.  That leads to my other dislike - the on-table ordering/entertainment system. It was perfectly fine until I saw the $2 entertainment fee on my check. It would be nice if they warned you that there's a charge before you use a game on the device, but they did not. Don't put a device on the table, give it the outward appearance of being free, and then covertly charge $2. No thanks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree?start=20

Cristina P.,"Quincy, MA",1,12,23,4.0,11/16/2015,"It's about time the Braintree mall was home to a good burger spot. Being from California I'm familiar to this chain restaurant known for its bottomless fries with every burger purchase. The new restaurant has a casual sports bar vibe with TVs from every angle and those futuristic tablet ordering systems at every table. I was a fan of the appetizer menu that included good eats starting at $3 with $5 and $7 categories as well. Because your app and main dish shouldn't be equally priced! (Highly recommend the wedge salad for $3, surprisingly was able to split  it with my husband). They had a fun menu of burgers which is the reason we came.

I asked my friends to taste it and they described it as if they were eating a spoonful of salt. I kindly told my server this and she had the audacity to tell me that's how French onion soup supposed to taste like.... Um... Ive had plenty of French onion soups and none of them has the salt concentration like this one. Then she told me that she'll tell the cook, I was expecting the manager to come over and talk to us... I'm not sure if she ever spoke to anyone about it but no one came and I ended up not touching the soup. My server saw the full cup of soup, didn't do anything about it. And I still had to pay for it!  Also, why can't we split the bill evenly with the zoisk!?!?!? Someone needs to do something about this too.

We sat at table #22 (as it said on the tablet). My friend and her 3 year old daughter were waiting for almost 30 minutes for the waiter to come to our table. And yes, I know , there's a tablet to order at the table. But a nice ""hello, I'll be right with you"" would've sufficed. My friend stood up and told the host that no one has approached our table and tables around us who seated AFTER us are ordering their food with a waiter. The guy who was supposed to be our waiter had just finished playing with a pet someone brought in the restaurant (gross) then speeds by while saying ""they gave me too many tables"". Not even an apology or ""I'll be right with you"". So we waited another 10 minutes. That guy was no where to be found. We stood up, gathered our belongings and left very disappointed and most of all HUNGRY!!! I mean, we couldn't even get a DRINK! How unfair is that??? I don't recommend this location to ANYONE.

Or being annoying to your server by asking them to split the bill. Food was good even though I asked for my burger to be medium rare, they gave me a medium burger they alcoholic drinks where weak and even if u ask for something neat expect it to be a one finger pour. How you can tell if the bartender is good or bad is how they pour your neat drink measured by your finger.

This afternoon we went about 2:50 and sat right away, but not without some serious confusion and poor communication between the hostesses. We stood around in the dining area for a few while they figured out which of the many empty tables to seat us at and told us to give the waiter awhile to come over. No problem, maybe they are short staffed.... But as our meal went on there were employees standing around by the kitchen.  One girl bussed the table next to us because another told her she'd cleaned three and that isn't her job. The first set of silverware was dirty.  The food was pretty good, but the two guys at the table next to us at their meal, paid, and left in the time it took to get our app. Our waiter was nice, but a little hard to come by once we got our food.

Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",161,1505,24565,4.0,10/29/2015,"""Yay! I'm a fan."", clearly states how I feel about this new burger destination at the South Shore Plaza in Braintree.  Say what you want, I'll STILL stick with the Millbury Red Robin. The interior or this location is ok, but I wish they kept the old interior design used in the Millbury and old Foxborough location. Plus, the logo is new, and not as cool as the old. I came in for take-out which was very confusing at first. I was going somewhere in Brockton, and thought to call the order in on the way there, but the Braintree Red Robin doesn't even have their phone number on their website! Didn't bother, so came in and ordered take out at the bar, as there weren't any signs or any employees to explain where to go (so that should get fixed, as should their website, WITH A PHONE NUMBER!!!). Anyway, Haily, an employee at the bar who helped us with our take out order was amazing. She was extremely friendly and knowledgable about the food (especially as they just opened). Definitely the highlight of my visit was customer service from Haily. She also made sure that my order was put in quickly and made within 10 minutes (WOW! Especially for a new place, where everyone is still learning how to run things). Still wish I could have called it in, but I still like this place, and my burger was very good (as it always is from Red Robin).  Located in the South Shore Plaza, by the parking garage, Lord&Taylor, and DSW.  Overall, 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree?start=40

The hosts need to actually seat people. Another problem is that 2/3 of their tables are in the bar and they won't let people with kids sit at those tables, so the bar was half empty the whole time.  There was also a table in the dining room that was open from the time we got there to the time we left, about 1 1/2 hours.

The grill chicken was tasty but the salad was limp (edges of lettuce were brown) and the diced onions were frozen and stuck together in big clumps.  It looked like the kind of salad that you would buy pre-packaged but at least those tasted fresher. The girls asked for refills on the fries with more than one waitstaff and the answer was the same "" it being made in the kitchen and its coming"".  If they offer ""bottomless"" fries, would you think that the kitchen is constantly making it  since its not a special custom order.  They ended up waiting 20 minutes and were finished with the chicken by then.    When I asked how did they like their dish since mine was a bust.  The response was ""it was ok but its the kind of chicken that makes you feel yucky afterwards"".  Now, this is coming from girls who loves to eat out at restaurants all the time.

When asked if there were seats at the bar, we were told, ""You can go check.""  When we checked the bar area, there were several regular tables open and high top tables available around the bar, so we chose a high top. I gave one star for our server, who offered to take care of us if we sat at a high top instead of the bar. He was upbeat and friendly throughout our visit, and the only real gem in the place. I was so grateful for his help, that I didn't say a word about how awful the food was.  Our $7 steak fries barely had any toppings on them and were very underwhelming.  Mac and cheese: just dry noodles with some shredded cheese melted on top. My salad was totally dry lettuce and mostly purple cabbage.  It came with no dressing. The avocado was brown. There was a long black hair in it.  My boyfriend ordered ""the big one"" burger, which in reality was very small. When he questioned our waiter about the size, he recommended that he order the Angus burger next time.   There will not be a next time.  Everything delivered to us was disappointing.

Vaughn I.,"Weymouth, MA",238,2,,1.0,12/29/2015,"A couple of years ago, I went to a restaurant in South Carolina with my mother and her husband at the time. To make a long story short, I'll just say it was one of the most racist experiences of my life, and we left within 15 minutes of being there...However, I think it's safe to say that going to this Red Robin was worse.  My girlfriend and I came in last night, and were very excited as we both hadn't been to a Red Robin in a long time. Like many of the other reviewers have said, we were told there was about a 20 min wait even though there were plenty of empty tables in the restaurant. We ended up waiting about 30 minutes to be seated at one of said empty tables. And it took another 15 min before one of the bus boys, named Kevin, came over and asked had anyone helped us yet. It was at this point that we should have gotten up and left. So the continued awful service experience that followed is half our fault for staying at this terribly run restaurant.  A waitress finally came over, and apologized for the delay. She told us that the waitress we were supposed to have was super overwhelmed and couldn't come to help us, so she came to take our table. Throughout this entire night, we heard other waitstaff apologizing to their tables for the delay and saying similar things. It sounded like something she made up, but she was very apologetic so we accepted it and moved on. We ordered our food right away, and also ordered two beers and water. It took about 5 min before she brought us our waters, and we asked about the beers. She said she was just waiting for the bartender to make our drinks and they'd be right up. another 5-10 min went by, and a different waitress brought us our food. We thanked her, and asked her about our beers, and she said she'd go check on them. Another 5 min went by, and we had to ask Kevin about our beers. He apologized and got our beers right away, even though two different servers couldn't. Our burgers tasted pretty good, which was one of the only saving graces of this entire thing. Though of course it wasn't completely ok, since mine had mayo on it even though the menu didn't specify that it would. I hate mayo, so I told our server, who damn near had a panic attack because she didn't know what to do, so she ran to tell the manager. The manager comes over and then proceeds to ask me why I didn't want mayo on it. Ummmm why does it matter?! I'm at a restaurant, and I don't want something on my burger. No questions need to be asked. Any other normal place would have just replaced it immediately. But whatever, I ate it with half of the bun because I didn't want to have to prolong this visit anymore than we needed to. The waitress comes over and we ask for the check, and I also order a milkshake to go at the same time. She comes back with the check and we pay, and then a min or so later comes back with the milkshake that's half empty. Not a joke or an exaggeration. It was literally half empty. So I ask her if they can add more to it, and she looks at it goes, oh ok I guess. As if there was nothing wrong with bringing me a half empty shake. She brings it back, and we waste no more time in getting out of that place. So to sum up this novel of a review: 30 min to be seated in a mostly empty dining room. 15 min for a server to come over with a made up story. 20 min and 3 attempts to ask for two beers to be served. A 1-2 min conversation about why I didn't want mayo on my burger. And a half empty milkshake that apparently isn't a big deal....We'll definitely be back again....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree?start=40

Of course it's new so everyone working there is pretty bright eyed and bushy tailed, which I appreciate. Keep it up! The blue ribbon burger was amazing. I got the 2 sauces (a steak sauce and a chipotle aioli) on the side, just because I am a little picky. Good thing I did it, because I am not a ketchup fan and the steak sauce was a bit ketchupy.  I love they way they do the bottomless fries. They give you a sorta small amount to begin with, and the refills are on the small side too. But think about it! How often do you finish ALL your fries? I basically never can finish them all at any given restaurant. This is a smart idea to keep the portions small, less waste all around.  Guinness on tap for my man, always a plus. He loved his all-American patty melt too.  They also had some really good looking desserts, but after clearing our entire plates, we had no room. Next time. Definitely next time.

This establishment is incredibly frugal with the concept of bottomless fries.  Instead of serving Fries right away, they hold off until the burger arrives.  This isn't how a Red Robin should be operated.  Every other Red Robin brings the fries to the table as appetizers, similar to how Texas Road house/Olive garden serves their rolls.  This establishment needs to step it up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree?start=60

I came here with my mother and little sister because my mother remembered taking me here as a child and wanted to share this with my sister. Well disclaimer we came on Black Friday so it was a wee bit busy but nothing crazy. Walked in and were walked to our seats immediately. The male host with glasses tried to seat us next to an aisle and my mother asked to sit next to the wall because she doesn't like people walking into her or having my sister close to a busy walkway. The host told us that he would but the other server of that section just got sat and so he couldn't seat us there. Well the female manager with glasses came over and said it was ok. So we sat down and immediately ordered an app from the computer thing on the table. Our server took a while to come to us and when did seemed to not care. We had to ask a few times about crayons and paper for the lil one. Our app came out. We got the chips with salsa and guac. Well don't bother. There isn't enough of either of the guac or salsa for the chips. As we were waiting I decided to sign up for the rewards program assuming I would want to come back. Couldn't do it on my phone but could on the computer. Well we waited and waited and waited for our food. The lil ones pizza finally came out and we continued to wait for our food. Now I would have forgotten the time if the two tables who came after us hadn't eaten , finished, paid, before we even got our food. The other four top in our row had the server go up to their table and the lady asked about the food and the brunette server looked at her and said yeah it's Black Friday, crazy huh. Shrugged her shoulders and walked away. I feel like the was the definition of a server saying idgaf. I ended up busting out laughing and so did the middle two top table. The server wasn't ours but I couldn't believe she would respond like that to a mother and her two children who as we talked is also a server. Our male server came over three times. I paid the bill before we were done because I just wanted to leave as soon as possible. We waited 45 mins for our two burgers. The male server that took care of us didn't care. Best part what was he could tell we weren't happy but I doubt he wanted to tell his manager considering the burger behind is in a burger was wrong somehow and already had to have the manager over. So honestly I don't plan on coming back to red robin. The only person in that restaurant that I dealt with that didn't piss me off was the female manager with glasses.

I put down 6 which was quite kind considering, the waiter literally hit the button to go back and tried convincing me to hit 10.  I will never come back to this location or any other Red Robbins again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree?start=60
Co C.,"Braintree, MA",0,4,,5.0,9/18/2016,Again if you want a great burger a different kind of burger.  This place is unique and is so worth going here for some lunch of dinner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree?start=60
Pedro L.,"Waltham, MA",0,2,,3.0,10/31/2015,"Went in after work for a quick beer. Sat at the bar which had about what looked like 3 bartenders on, and about 6 guests. I grabbed the drink menu that was on the bar when I got there, sat around for a few minutes and still no greet. The bartenders did not seem busy with any guests. Why not the 1 star? I worked at restaurants for many years and I will not judge a whole place by one bad experience. I was really thirsty for a cold one but being that it just opened up and people are still training, no biggie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree?start=60
Evan B.,"Bridgewater, MA",2,6,1,5.0,1/24/2016,"Really good staff, easy to access from the mall. Shoutout to Ryan the bartender/waiter.

Peng L.,"Quincy, MA",381,125,144,3.0,12/26/2015,"This place is a decent place to eat with your friends. The food is good, we got the onion tower as our appetizer and it was delish. Not only that the main course was pretty good in my opinion. The bill was split relatively easily since there was this machine that we passed around and we just payed our portions and tipped. Overall this place is pretty good if your here for a good burger. The seafood isn't as good so beware when you try it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree?start=60
Emily F.,"Braintree, MA",0,2,,1.0,5/27/2016,"The food was wonderful but the service was absolutely horrendous. My friends and I had Donna as a waitress. We waited about 15 minutes for her to take our order. The food came quickly. We finished and it took about 40 minutes to get the check. A manager finally came over to give us our bill. We had our payments ready but it took another 20 minutes for her to take our payment. We waited for her to give us back our change and cards for about 10 minutes. She then swiped the wrong cards for the wrong meals. Never coming here again. The manager was useless and gave us a free appetizer for our ""next visit"". I'm raffling them off for anyone who wants to try their luck at this god forsaken establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree?start=60

Shar M.,"Boston, MA",57,16,1,1.0,3/22/2016,This place was awful we walked in and we're out in less than. 5 min. The host (not sure of the name but a guy with glasses looks 30ish or more) was super rude he said there was a wait and there was plenty of empty tables. Aside from that when he made us sit at the bar area without us wanting to he said it would be a few min for the menus which never came when he finally came back around we had seen some empty booths that just needed some cleaning and maybe a quick wipe down when I asked if we can be seated there with an attitude he said that we should maybe sit in the lobby area so that we can be seated....then I see him sit a 2 person party just like we were in a booth after we have been waiting. The service is horrible here and the staff is rude that God we didn't spend on penny here. This was our first and last time . You lost out on a potential loyal customer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree?start=60
Lisa M.,"Boston, MA",20,63,51,4.0,11/2/2015,"Great Burgers. So juicy and loaded lettuce, tomato, pickles ect.  The steak fries are bottomless and cooked thru. Great place for lunch.

Dan F.,"Burbank, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/21/2015,Went for lunch today and the place was fairly empty. It took the hostess 10-15 minutes to seat us because the tables had to be wiped off. Couldn't she have done that to help out since it was not busy? Did not get silverware/napkin setups until already eating the food. Burger was ordered with cheese and the waiter did not notice the burger did not have it when he brought the food out and seemed less than concerned when it was pointed out to him. Better training all around is needed by management. How about having the manager walk the floor to stay on top of these things.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree?start=60
Jen B.,"Lakeville, MA",30,3,,2.0,4/25/2016,"My Mother and I were heading into Boston to see a play and decided to eat close to the T. I'd been to Red Robin in Plymouth a few years back and remembered the food was decent.  We got there a little after 1pm so it was pretty steady.  Took awhile (maybe 10 minutes ) for the waitress to arrive.  Drinks took forever to come.  I had water and my mom had coffee.  We ordered the spinach and parmesan dip.  Very good. I had the Ramen burger (substituted it with grilled chicken ) and a side salad. And my mom had a plain chicken sandwich with the fruit.  Food was excellent but like the drinks, it took a long time to arrive.   Then the check arrived.  We were not told that in order to use a charge card, we had to swipe the ipad on the table. So we sat there wasting more time.  My Mom paid the bill with help from the waitress.  Overall,  the experience could have been better. We more than likely will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree?start=60

Robert C.,"Medford, MA",1,61,10,4.0,2/27/2016,"The 4 stars are for the manager, Christina. After waiting 45 minutes to be seated, no server in sight for 10 minutes, enter Christina. She took our full drink and food order while our server NEVER showed. Food was average and our server who finally showed never brought our fries or second drink order-never showed on bill either.

Angelo M.,"Rochester, NY",1,7,,1.0,12/21/2015,"We put in our names and they said we would get text when ready. That was nice as we got to walk the mall. Promptly went to restaurant once received text. Waited 15 minutes to be seated, why page us? Walking to table saw many empty tables loaded with dirty dishes. Waited another 20 minutes to place our order??? Waitress apologized for taking so long. Then another 25 minutes for food. All around us i hear waitresses apologizing for delays.  I ordered the bottomless root beer float. Never received it till after we got food. Never saw waitress till we were done eating. So didn't get a refill on the float, any drinks or bottomless fries. My daughter ordered a drink that she didn't get at all. No one was around to check on us. Then went to use coupon for a free burger, waitress couldn't get the burger credited. She Went to a manager several times until the manager finally just deleted the burger from the order ( another 10 minutes of my life ). Just as leaving a different manager came up to us and asked if we got burger coupon to work? I quickly said "" yes thank you"" not wanting to waste any more time there. The managers response ""good cause i don't know how to make those things work"". Yes thank you for giving me hope for the future of this location. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree?start=60
Marcia W.,"Boston, MA",0,48,37,3.0,7/29/2016,"This was my 1st time in a Red Robin. I honestly thought it was more of a  fast food joint lol, so I was surprised to see it was a sit down restaurant. I went with my family on July 4. I was hesitant about the menu, mostly burgers since I'm not really a burger person, but I got a chicken sandwich thing. Their plating set up for stuff was interesting? The waitress was pretty decent and attentive thankfully. It was a holiday at lunch time so it wasn't very busy, thank goodness. And even though she had a hard time understanding what one of my brothers said (he's special needs), she still talked directly to him when one of us would translate. I wish more people would do that with him. So I appreciated her level of patience. And I saw they do root beer floats so I encouraged him to get one since he LOVES root beer and I wanted him to have a float at least 1x in his life. HE LOVED IT and he was all smiles the rest of the day. (Now every time we go to a restaurant he wants a root beer float lol.) The desserts were odd too. My brother got a mud pie which was bigger than we expected, I got those chocolate stick things which were kinda boring for a dessert so I was a bit let down by it and offered the rest to my family lol. Overall, service was great for us (maybe worse if you go at a busy time?) but the food was kinda ehhh to me. It wasn't anything that would urge me to return even though it's location is very convenient.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree?start=80
McKenna P.,"Halifax, MA",0,2,,5.0,11/8/2015,"Best red robin I've been to by far they treated me like I owned the place any problem they insisted on fixing no matter what the issue, I ordered wings and they brought boneless without complaining she had noticed once I had eaten them she said my mistake and already had the wings brought over. My burger was cooked a little rare to my liking had one back at my table in 5 minutes.

Jess J.,"Quincy, MA",0,20,6,2.0,2/21/2016,"Came here when it first opened and the service was terrible. Took us an hour and 15 mins to get our food (and we didn't see our waitress for a good 45 mins.) We had to track down a manager to see what was going on and she compensated us with French fries for our wait. Plus, the waiter was extremely rude. And forget about us getting any drink refills. Besides that, we decided to give them another try and come back this week. Food was good and came out quick and waitress this time was pretty attentive. So that's a good thing. Still can't get over our first visit though. Definitely not gonna be a ""regular spot"" for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree?start=80

Carrie S.,"Norwell, MA",0,4,,1.0,2/22/2016,"Don't waste your time! We went on a Saturday night and were told there would be an hour wait. This was ok as we were planning to do some shopping in the mall, but was puzzling because each time we checked back there were plenty of empty tables in this small restaurant (9 at one point!). The host was complaining about working alone and set an unpleasant tone from the beginning of our meal. Once we were seated, we were served out drinks and our orders were taken. And then the real wait began. The kids played with the little tablet that was provided on the table. After 45 minutes we began to ask for our food. The manager came over to apologize for the wait, but did nothing to compensate us. Our food finally arrived, but the sweet potato fries and kids' grilled cheese bites were cold. The burgers were fine, but hardly ""gourmet,"" and not one was prepared as ordered. The steak fries were good. The coleslaw was inedible, doused in a heavy quantity of a mustardy dressing. When the check came, we were charged an ""entertainment fee."" When we inquired what this was for we were told the kids had played ""premium"" games on the tablet, for which there was a charge. The kids denied seeing anything that told them they had to pay to play and the adults had not checked it. The manager did remove the charge from our bill. We will not be returning!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree?start=80
