Steven C.,"Brandon, FL",0,3,,4.0,11/23/2017,"This is my family's favorite burger place. When we go, we always have great time and the food is of quality. I have eaten at Red Robin's all over the country and the one here in Brandon is  solid on presentation and taste. The fries were fresh and hot and the burgers were cooked close to perfect.  As with all restaurants,  service is what determines most ratings. In the case of Red Robin, the only critique I can offer the Brandon location is....if you stay open until a certain time make sure you  willing to give the best service until that final customer leaves.  Overall is was a good experience and I will be coming back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brandon
Karina F.,"Bradenton, FL",31,29,,1.0,12/26/2017,I can say I will not be back at this place. Kevin was our waiter n he was bad. Took forever to take our order forever to bring our drinks. And the way he spoke to us we couldn't understand one word. He needs to pickup his jeans I don't need to see his underwear  We asked for more fries n never got them n no refills on our drinks  I will not be going back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brandon
Mikayla B.,"Brandon, FL",32,53,11,1.0,12/14/2017,"Really great burgers but their rewards system is so frustrating. First lost sll.of our points a few years agonwhen they changed programs and then they accidently used our free burger we earned on a $6 bill even though we asked them not to. They told us it was fixed and would be there when we come back in. Low and behold, surprise surprise, it wasn't there. Managers just shrug their shoulders and say there is nothing they can do. Very frustrating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brandon
Barret R.,"Tampa, FL",30,6,1,3.0,4/3/2017,"Quick sum-up of our experience: -Below average food, generally lower quality than other restaurants and not up to the standard that Red Robin usually provides at other locations -Average service and speed (there was a ""glitch"" with our order in the system and it took a while to get ours but others seemed to get their food when you would expect) -Slight smell (wife described it as ""barf smelling"") throughout the restaurant Overall the place was not what we had expected it to be. When we arrived at the restaurant we had to wait a few minutes to be seated as the host(ess) was not at the host(ess) podium but were seated immediately after they arrived. When we entered the restaurant my wife immediately could smell something unpleasant (she described it as ""barf smelling"") and persisted throughout the restaurant. Our waitress was not the friendliest and due to an issue with our order we had to wait about 30 minutes to get our main course. We did however, order the chips and guacamole appetizer and it was pretty good. We will probably give this place another try as it's so close to our place, generally like Red Robin, and know that everyone, no matter what industry your in, is bound to have a bad day here and there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brandon

Heather S.,"Tampa, FL",38,80,91,5.0,6/24/2017,"We always have a great time when we visit this location. We have a child with an egg allergy and he has been able to eat here safely MANY times. Some of his favorites are mac and cheese (bottomless), grilled cheese, and grilled chicken with mandarin oranges (his favorite bottomless side). My husband and I enjoy ordering the tavern burgers to leave space for the yummy bottomless sides. We start with a side of broccoli and then our next side is fries (it's all about balance right?).

Tate A.,"Lakeland, FL",165,5,,1.0,5/13/2017,"Here's a few questions I asked myself several times.  1.) Where is my server? 2.) Why is my glass empty? 3.) Why is this grilled chicken crunchy in the middle? 4.) if my fries are bottomless, why have I only been served one helping. I asked for soft, hot broccoli and it was almost raw and barely warm.. sad visit. I usually love Red Robin.

Tia S.,"Tampa, FL",710,244,1754,1.0,2/14/2016,"I was planning to have dinner at another burger place but when my friend called me to see if I wanted to meet up, we chose Red Robin because of their Tavern Burger promotion to get 2 burgers with either and appetizer or dessert for $15. I mean the burgers at Red Robin are usually $9-10 a piece so this seemed like a good deal. Plus who doesn't love the bottomless fries?!  Little did we know the menu recently changed and the burgers we were used to were classified as Gourmet Burgers and were not included in the promotion. They have created a set of 5 Tavern Burgers that are variations of a small cheeseburger. So that was disappointing to discover but we were already at the restaurant so we decided to stay.  We placed our order for food and the wait was a bit ridiculous for a place that specializes in one type of cuisine. Burgers and fries should always be ready to go especially with the restaurant being as full as it was during my visit. It took more than 20 minutes for our food to be delivered and then when it was the burgers were luke warm.  The fries were hot and apparently was the holdup causing our burgers to have to sit in the window and get cold.  Aside from the timing, the burgers just were not very good and not what I expected based on my previous visits to this chain. The patties on the tavern burger are the size of a McDonald's cheeseburger, much smaller than I anticipated for a ""gourmet burger"" restaurant. I ordered the Turbo-q burger which was topped with grilled onions, a spicy sauce and pepper jack cheese with a piece of lettuce. I thought all burgers came with lettuce and tomato but apparently that was a revision I missed as well. It was ok but not a burger I would order again. My friend ordered the Fiery Ghost it was topped with pepper jack cheese, a spicy sauce and raw sliced jalapeños. She was not every excited about her burger either.  For dessert we tried the doughnuts which our server said were so good. I disagree. The doughnuts are fried biscuits and they are not sweet enough for me even with the sugar sprinkle and duo of sauces which accompanied dish. They are ok but not the best versions of fried doughnuts that I have had at local restaurants.  Needless to say we won't be in a rush to go back any time soon. I was actually wishing I had gone to Five Guys like I originally planned. The service and the food quality would have been better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brandon
CJ W.,"TRACYS LNDG, MD",0,34,2,5.0,3/13/2017,"Have eaten here several times in 2017 and found the service among the best anywhere. Burgers are just awesome! And they have my favorite beer...Not Your Fathers RB. Last night we were in town and went to RR at the Mall. We had a problem with paying our check at the table and the night manager Victoria came over. We couldn't figure out what happened, so Victoria gave us the balance of our meal and covered the tip for our server. Wow...that was very cool.  Later that evening we discovered it was OUR error in the card we used. We called Victoria to pay the balance of the check and she declined our offer/request to pay.  That's some pretty incredible customer service... not to mention generosity and goodwill.  We highly recommend Red Robin at the Mall!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brandon
Stephenie C.,"Riverview, FL",14,27,6,3.0,8/26/2017,Hostesses were amazingly accommodating because our son has autism! They put us in an area away from babies due to his sensitivity to crying. Our waiter was nice but seemed to just be doing the enough to get it done. We had to ask for refills for half of our party three times because he was forgetting. The knives were dirty that were placed for us. I got my own to go cup as I was leaving liked I worked there. I felt like I wasn't his priority and he snapped at my mom when she asked a question!

Keisha P.,"Brandon, FL",52,31,7,1.0,5/24/2017,I ordered a Caesar salad. Wasn't that great. They drowned the lettuce in dressing. The chicken was extremely tough. It was the worst salad I've ever had.  I don't think I'd eat there again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brandon
Katherine M.,"Lutz, FL",22,78,63,4.0,7/23/2017,"This is my second visit to the Brandon location and my best visit yet.  Our wait time was about 20 minutes and what I love is that they text you when your table is ready so you are free to roam the mall or go next door to Brass Tap and have a drink.  They are always busy due to being at a mall but both visits my wait time was about 20 minutes.  Our waitress was amazing, we didn't have to ask once for refills on drinks or our fries.  Refills on fries you may ask?  Red Robin offers with most of their meals bottomless fries.  I haven't eaten a burger there thay I have disliked but I do tend to get most of the time the Bleu Ribbon burger which is one of their signature burgers. I wish they would give more fries with your meal so that you don't have to ask for more.  When this establishment first came to the area you used to get a decent amount and now the portions are smaller - I find that myself and others usually have to request 1 more refill on fries to be satisfied.  This visit we would get another refill quickly, but in previous visits it would take a while and the portions would still be small.  They have a full bar, other variety of items on the menu other than burgers (but seriously - you should be getting a burger!) and milkshakes and malts.  If you have any room for desert - their chocolate malts are delicious!  If you are looking at the price and thinking to yourself $10 for a burger, remember that most drive throughs you pay on average $7-8 for the meal.  For a couple dollars more you have a freshly made meal and a burger 10x better and bottomless fries.  Red Robbin also offers a rewards, after 9 visits you get your next burger free and on your birthday month you get a free burger (which I used this visit).  This place is great for anyone - a date night, kids birthday or just out with family and friends.  If you're craving for a good burger - this is the place to go!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brandon

It is not real clean , un-bussed tables and seems to be under staffed every time we come. The server Derek was ok  but it is  not good enough to make up for the rest of the issues. There is a big line and a long wait but there are cleans tables and ones that are not , not sure what the wait is. For the food is was ok nothing great but is was ok.

She never asked how I would like it.  The food took a long time I hadn't seen the waitress for 15 minutes.  Finally she brought the food out. OMG the burger was greasy and burnt. No tomatoes. The fries were good. But since she gave me my food like haven't seen her again.  No drink refills no water no nothing.  I asked a different waitress for the check and another for a take out tray. And the bottomless fries, forget it if you can get a waitress good luck. The food and Service was the worst. I'll go to Mc D's  next time.

Geoff N.,"Tampa, FL",87,9,5,2.0,10/28/2016,"Last three times we've gone here we experienced bad service.  Last night our server took almost ten minutes (with only one other table seated in our area) our drink orders brought out took our appetizer order and then brought out the apps.  Forgot the ranch and mustard.  No Napkins or silverware still.  My wife ordered her sandwich open faced, which apparently is difficult as it came out wrong twice(she just ate it as is the second time)  I then had to ASK for napkins and silverware.  My burger also didn't come with the extra I had ordered on the side.  I asked for my fries with no salt, received garlic butter fries.   The times before this the servers that we've gotten have been slow.  I've been to many Red Robins in a couple of different cities, and we like the food.  It will be a long time before we step foot in this Red Robin again, we'll take our business elsewhere.  Sorry three strikes your out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brandon
Bo W.,"Redondo Beach, CA",226,509,1815,2.0,2/22/2016,"While working up a hunger doing some mall walking, we stopped in at Red Robin to fill our reserves. This review is based on food, service, cleanliness, atmosphere, and value.  We were the first ones there , so we were seated fast.  The dining area was clean, and service was good.  As with all Red Robins, the decor is nice.  It's not real flashy or modern, but nice.  We ordered the Reds Tavern Fries.  It took a while, and our server told us they burnt the first batch, so they were making us a fresh batch.  I'm glad they didn't serve us burnt fries.  The fries were good, but didn't have much toppings, a disappointing amount of toppings.  Only about 10% were the Reds Tavern Fries, three rest were just... fries.  For the price, I expected better.  I ordered the Wedgie Burger.  Red Robin advertises ""gourmet burgers"", but I'm not a fan.  Their patties just don't taste fresh to me.  The Wedgie Burger was less than okay.  I wouldn't order it again.  Like all burgers from every Red Robin location I've ever been to, the patty was dry and tasteless.  They taste like the dry, frozen patties you can get by the case of 40 at nearly any grocery store for $25. I don't know how Red Robin keeps getting me to walk through their doors.  Overall, subpar food at gourmet prices.  I feel bad writing this, because I like the atmosphere and service, but I'm leaving this review as a reminder to myself to never go back.  I just don't like Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brandon
Miles B.,"Apollo Beach, FL",11,29,14,2.0,5/14/2017,This location is a pain to go to on weekends because mall gets super packed after 2pm. Its located in Brandon town center mall.  So parking is a hassle to find.  I was there yesterday and the 40 min wait to be seated with my family. Then our food took more than an hour too come out.

Kathy T.,"San Diego, CA",420,348,2384,3.0,2/4/2016,"This Red Robin is located in the Brandon Westfield Mall. Enjoyable atmosphere, a little different than your typical Red Robin, in that the lighting is dimmer, which makes it more intimate. iPads are fixed on the tables, which allow you to not only see the menu options to order, but also to sign up or add/check your club rewards. You also can send an alert to your server if you need anything in between her/his visits while attending to your order. If you belong to the rewards program, one of the perks is a free hamburger on your birthday, but I'm not sure if the free burger is a plain, stripped down burger, or one of their specialty burgers. It's free to join, however. Although I enjoyed my Marco Polo grilled chicken sandwich ($12.99) and freckled strawberry lemonade ($4.49), and my daughter enjoyed her Southern Charm burger ($13.99), fries and freckled strawberry lemonade ($4.49), the lemonade tasted too overly sour, even with the sweetened strawberries in it. Although my daughter said her burger was really good, my Marco Polo chicken sandwich wasn't the knock-your-socks-off type. I've had much better for less money. In fact, I was slightly irritated when I received the check for our lunch. The total lunch bill was $48.00. It also minorly bothered me that there was an additional charge for MY order, because I switched out French fries for onion rings. I wasn't advised there would be an up-charge of $1.49 to change the fries out when I ordered lunch. I think that is something that should always be pointed out during the ordering process. We ordered directly with our waitress, Justine, instead of through the iPad. When I ordered, I do remember asking her if I could replace the French fries with onion rings and she said, ""Sure"", but that's when your server should tell you there's an additional charge to do so, if that is their policy. Not a large amount of $, but it's the principle of the matter. Service otherwise was cordial and friendly, although I had to ask for a second (endless lemonade) refill. I've been to a lot of Red Robin restaurants over the years, but I don't remember a lunch for two people ever being in the $50 range there. That's one expensive burger and chicken sandwich. To justify that price, it would've had to have been excellent, and that, it just was not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brandon?start=20

We pushed the call button on the pad and NO one else stopped to help-- the manager and several other wait staff walked circles around us, yet never bothered to check on us/the blinking light. EIGHT minutes we sat there with the light blinking, trying to get anyone's attention. Oh, the food? Order was semi-right (they forgot to put mac 'n cheese on the mac 'n cheese burger, ordered a single, got a double) and a couple burgers were nearly red they were so pink...when asked for well.

Luis V.,"Tampa, FL",55,19,12,1.0,7/21/2016,"I usually don't write bad reviews, but when I see bad customer service especially from the management, people need to be advised before eating here. First off the burgers are actually not bad, the fries are bland like always, but that is what you would expect for unlimited fries. The customer service is something that could be worked on. The servers are slow and not as friendly as other Red Robins I have been to. There was an issue of a coupon we received through email from red robins that could only be used for today. It was a buy a gourmet burger and get one 50% off. This was a great deal and instead of going to the food court my friend and I decided to dine in and split the check since I was not going to eat two burgers in one sitting.  We split the burgers and it was time to pay. We told the server before hand that we were doing the deal but when we pressed the pay option on the electronic device which was not explained to us, the split option charged us the full price for both burgers. After trying to track down the server and explaining to them again about the coupon, he took the device and came back shortly with the coupon inputted so the total price was lower. However we tried choosing the split the bill option and it did the same thing again where it charged us the full price. We tried tracking down the server yet again to explain that we would want to split   the bill, he tried looking at the device again and said sorry one of you guys would have to pay the whole bill to receive the coupon. After examining the coupon on the email it never mentioned that one person would have to pay the whole meal or there were any restrictions. My other friend received the email as well but it didn't matter. We wanted to talk to a manager if possible we asked the server. The server replied "" Are you sure?  We replied yes. he replied ""He is just going to say the same thing I told you."" Then again we said please get the manager. The Manager came by, didn't apologize and said one of you guys would have to take the bill or pay separate for full amount. The device wont let us split the bill. I do not know if this is a Red Robin policy that managers of the store are not able to override the device and split the bill, but this put us in a awkward situation. We both had cards, we both wanted to split the bill and we only choose Red Robin because of the coupon deal. He didn't give us any coupons or discounts when we split the bill and paid full price.  Moral of the story is don't visit Brandon's mall Red Robins with coupons. Hope that the check device works for you when you split a bill and don't count on management or servers to fix the problem.

We were told an hour wait and at an hour and a half I go to ask how much longer.  At that time I'm told it ""Will be as long as it takes"". So I asked what about outside. I was told we don't have enough servers so you won't get the same service because it's the same servers as inside.  I said ok well if we wait and sit inside how will the service be, Will it be the same as if we sit inside? She tells me no not now. At this point, I'm upset so I talk to the manager. He goes on to tell me that they are working on how they talk to and treat their customers.  That is unacceptable! We wait to be seated then wait another 30 minutes after that to get drinks. At this point half our party leaves because it took so long.  Food came out, of course it was cold. The waitress did the best she could but our party was still split up, food was cold and the service was horrible. My advice to anyone wanting to eat at Red Robin in Brandon Mall - don't!

Tonight's were so burned when they arrived we asked for a manager. The burned fries were a big f-you for complaining I think. The manager eventually cooked the third set and brought them to the table. The fries always arrive when I'm done with the burger too. The server was also scarce. I think they don't have enough staff on the floor for good service. They rely too much on the table kiosk. If I wanted fast food and to serve myself I'd go elsewhere.

What I didn't like about it was it came in a basket, fish piled on top of the fries so that the grease (not too much) dripped onto the fries. Yuck.  Also, the basket was small so I had to grab the plate the utensils and napkins came on to eat off of.  Not cool, but it worked. Also their salt shakers were the kind you grind so you got big chunks of salt  on your food,,, and fish and chips need salt..bring back the regular salt shakers please, not a fan.

I asked if they had any burgers that were thicker, so they would come out more rare, and they said no.  Also, the fries were frozen and not fresh.  You would think in a burger place, they would have fresh fries, not here.  Do yourself a favor, save a couple of bucks, walk back inside and get yourself some delicious Five Guys burgers and fries.

The plates we received our order on looked old and grease stained with the finish having significant wear.

Now for the food: my regular bottomless fries had a few with cheese and chili on them and the others looked like they were re-gifted. I wondered if they took them off someone else's plate and put them on mine along with a clump of fried something I couldn't identify. My wife's food looked just as bad. It was a horrible looking burger that looked thrown together and like it was taken from someone else's plate.

Recalling my younger days when the 5 hour flight to Waikiki was a weekend trip for airline employees based on the west coast, slammin down what were called Teriburgers was all we needed. Served at all the beachside snack shops the teriyaki burgers were heavenly with that slice of grilled pineapple in there. I just had one and I want another. Red Robin's Banzai is remarkably close. With it you get endless fries which are of the steak cut variety. This time the fries were a bit undercooked but I didn't care, not when a Banzai is sitting next to them.

Alicea N.,"Valrico, FL",0,2,,2.0,1/30/2015,"I have been a fan of Red Robin pretty much since I first tried it when they opened this location. My husband and I have been several times and USED to always get excellent service. We went about a week ago on a date night and waited at the door for over 5 minutes before someone even approached us to seat us. The restaurant was dead, with maybe 4 tables occupied. We only stayed because we were really craving the (super amazing) food.  The person who finally greeted us did apologize for the wait, which was a plus. However, after we were seated it was a good 5 more minutes before our order was taken, and after that we didn't see any servers until our food came out and then when we got the check (close to 10 minutes after we had finished eating, and without asking if there was anything else we needed). Just horrible, especially for such a slow night. Tonight we went back with our kids. We were seated right away, and while more tables were occupied it still wasn't too terribly busy. We were seated at the booth right between the kitchen and the computer where the waiters total their orders. Several employees walked past and didn't acknowledge our existence. We sat there for close to 10 minutes without being even so much as told it would just be a minute before we called it and walked out. Unacceptable. It's a shame, because we're on a low carb diet and nothing quite hit the spot like a double patty burger and salad from Red Robin, but we won't be back thanks to how badly the service has plummeted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brandon?start=60

Steve F.,"Valrico, FL",1,15,2,4.0,4/16/2015,"This Red Robin is located inside a mall and, as such, faces challenges a stand-alone location would not. For example, large groups of teenagers popping in to use the restrooms--and thoroughly trashing them--without making any purchases. They are also quite busy on the weekends, especially during the Thanksgiving-to-Christmas shopping period. Despite those challenges, this location manages to provide a very pleasurable experience with regard to both the food and atmosphere. I have been seated very quickly on most of my visits, except a couple of times during the aforementioned period when the mall itself is crowded beyond belief. The waitstaff has been unfailingly attentive, stopping by to check on my table every ten minutes or so to top up drinks and fries or to offer dessert. The dining room has been clean every time I've visited--I'm not going to ding them for the exterior areas, as those are rightly the mall's responsibility--and, yes, the bathrooms can get visibly dirtier than one would see in a stand-alone establishment but, again, this is a mall location that has to deal with mall traffic and I think they maintain reasonable standards given their situation. The dining room can get noisy during busy periods, prohibiting conversation at your table, so if you're the sort of person who enjoys socializing at the table, stick to weekday evenings and lunchtime. The food is above-average for burgers. I would like the burger patties themselves to be better seasoned, as they tend to not have much flavor by themselves, but the menu offers sufficient varieties of toppings to offset that minor flaw. While I appreciate the ""bottemless"" fries and the variety of sauces for them beyond your basic ketchup, I do find them to be a bit floury-tasting and dry. I'd much rather they be skillet fried given their thickness, or else have the more common thin-cut fries if Red Robin insists on deep-frying them. Most of the desserts are tasty, and I especially enjoy the doughnut towers, but they are also a bit pricey for the amount your receive. A tip for those who find the prices here a bit on the high side: join the Red Robin Royalty club and you'll receive coupons every six weeks or so in your email. As an example, last week Royalty members received 15% their total meal purchase once a day for an entire week. That really helps keep some money in your wallet, and I've not received any junk mail from signing up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brandon?start=60

As for the food, the burger was good, but wasn't better than what you would expect from a place with gourmet in the title or from a table service burger restaurant.  We ordered the fruffles, as part of the two for 15 deal.  Unfortunately, they weren't fully thawed.  I get that most of these places have pre-made frozen deserts.  I don't mind.  I do expect them to thaw them out fully.  My fruffles had the cold sweats.  Maybe they spun them around and around and gave them motion sickness.  I think the cold sweats were due to a crappy thaw.  I wrapped them up in my napkin (I was too scared to ask the waitress for a box) and brought them home to fully thaw.  They were pretty good once you got them to room temp.  As a nice capper, the waitress told us to pay the grease computer.  Ordinarily, I would have been more than excited to use the cool computer.  At least dinner was finally over.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brandon?start=60
Carlos H.,"Tampa, FL",3388,793,1522,3.0,1/4/2013,"One of the reasons I was avoiding Red Robin when they came to Brandon was my initial impression that they were quite expensive - perhaps from one day years ago when I Googled them and their online menu suggested higher prices? The crazy long waits were also another reason I was staying away, however the other day some friends and I decided to give it a shot. I ordered the classic gourmet burger ($8.99). The burger itself was nothing too impressive. Square 1 Burgers has much better beef quality and seasoning. The ingredients did not taste impressive either and the size of the burger was also quite small. It looked more like a large Whopper from Burger King than a gourmet burger to me. The bottomless steak fries were pretty good. They required some salt/seasoning for the right taste, but with an endless supply - there was certainly enough to go around. The waitress was quick to bring refills on both the fries and our drinks as well. Overall, decent burger...but I prefer Square 1 Burgers if I am in Brandon.

Jamie M.,"Riverview, FL",0,10,,5.0,6/19/2016,"Having food allergies, I'm nervous dining out places because of some bad experiences. I'd rather a place say that they don't have anything I can eat than to have an allergen menu and then disregard it. So when I heard enough people with allergies talk about Red Robin, I reluctantly gave it a try... and I'm so glad I did! It was Father's Day and the restaurant was busy, but not so busy that we didn't get seated immediately. I liked that the booth was high so that I wasn't back-to-back with the next person. In fact, my 3 year old stood up and wasn't tall enough to look over it (always a plus). When they gave us menus, I was nervous when they said they didn't have an allergen menu and that I would have to go on my smartphone to look up the items that comply with my dietary requirements. I thought I was screwed. Luckily, there was a very extensive menu of items I could choose from and all of them seemed reasonably priced. We ordered the Baja Dip and Chips, two burgers, garlic fries, fruit salad and a lemonade for my husband. I was surprised that the burgers came with bottomless sides. Initially, I had ordered a gluten-free bun, but right before my order came out, they let me know they ran out and I had a manager personally come to my table and make it up to me by giving me a voucher for my next visit. They didn't have to go the extra mile, but they did, and for a first time visitor, that made all the difference in the world! I ended up having my burger on a lettuce wrap. I was satisfied with it, as I'm used to ordering just a burger in lettuce at other burger places. It was very juicy, especially with the leftover baja sauce I put on it from the appetizer. My husband had a bacon guac burger that he raved over. The garlic fries were amazing and the freckled fruit salad was addicting. My husband wasn't overly fond of the lemonade, but I don't blame the restaurant, as everyone's tastes are different. Finally, I don't know what was better- the food or the service. Our server, Amber Dawn, was simply amazing. She was helpful in having us navigate how Red Robin works, including their rewards club, ordering and paying (whoa, technology!), extremely knowledgable about the menu and explaining how seriously they take allergy orders, and just super friendly overall. All of our food was brought to us within a reasonable amount of time (and believe me, with a 3 year old, we notice every minute!), and the drinks were always refiled promptly. Though I didn't catch the woman's name, there was also a runner who brought us food who was friendly and cheerful.  For less than $30 (not including tip), my husband, my 3 year old and I were completely stuffed, satisfied and eager to return.

Amy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",365,306,155,3.0,4/27/2013,"I usually wouldn't jump to visit a chain restaurant like this but when family consensus is overwhelmingly for it, I had no choice. Against all hesitation and weariness, I was however pleasantly surprised. We were celebrating grandma's birthday. It was a party of five. Grandma and I shared the crispy cod fish sandwich, which was soft and delicate and just the right amount of crispy. Mom enjoyed a large chicken salad  (she wished the chicken had not been cold). Brother got the burger which he swears by. The Bad My grandma and I both ordered the clam chowder. Each of our orders tasted and looked like completely different soups. One was watery, lacking clams and light in color. The other was thick, full of clams, yet incredibly salty. Something was up. We asked the waitress who said one of us got a fresh batch and the other got the ends of the last batch. She did everything in her power to rectify the issue - It was a problem from the kitchen, so we didn't blame her. She brought us a new bowl and even the manager came over to apologize. This was nice of her. The Good When the manager learned that it was my grandmother's birthday, she asked if she could bring a dessert. We asked if they had anything sugar free (as grandma is diabetic), but they did not have anything. Later, we were told the manager searched the mall looking for a sugar free dessert for her. This was really sweet and unexpected. Although she couldn't find her anything sans sugar, she brought a complimentary dessert for the table anyway and still had the servers gather round to sing Happy Birthday. Grandma was happy. She got balloons :) The customer service here makes up for any lacking in the kitchen. The burger and the fish sandwich was also worth it. One of the best perks is that there is unlimited fries with certain sandwiches/ burgers so that should fill you up. 3.5",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brandon?start=80

We arrived and were told that there would be a 30 minute wait, but could receive a text whenever our table was ready allowing us to go peruse the mall. This was a nice feature! We were seated next to a table with multiple children that were making a huge mess all over the floor and tables. When the table left no one came over to clean up the mess so we were left to sit next to it throughout our meal until right before we left. About 5 minutes went by before a server came to get our drinks. Both of us had waters. We placed our order with our drink order. 20 minutes later someone - not our server- came out to ask us if we had ordered (what we did) and then ran back to the kitchen. After 40 minutes had passed our meals came out. I was tempted to send mine back. I had ordered the grilled chicken sandwich. My entire sandwich was cold. The buns had basically disintegrated after sitting for so long and from water/juice . I asked for an extra plate and ate just the chicken on the plate and sent the rest of the slop back. They offered to replace my sandwich but we weren't ready to wait any longer. The bf enjoyed his burger, but it was almost cold when it came out.

Our group of 6 ate at Red Robin Sunday evening, December 9; we arrived before 5 and gave the host our names and were told that when our seating was ready, we'd be sent a text message on the cellphone number we provided.  That didn't happen--when we asked about our seat and gave our party's name, we were told that that party had just been seated.  Uh oh.  Despite this, we were given a table pretty soon after that, so we felt things were looking up; we then hit another bump in the road. We sat at our table for 15 minutes, and no one came to see us. We tried a few times to catch someone's attention, but it wasn't until we stopped Natasha, a server walking by our table, that things really began to look up.  She hadn't even clocked in to work yet, but stopped everything else she was doing, apologized for our wait, and took our entire order.  After that point, she went above and beyond to ensure every question was answered and each need we had was met.  She was awesome, and any restaurant would be lucky to have her. Our food was really good; if you've not been to Red Robin before, order the Royal Red Robin burger, their signature sandwich.  It's a nicely done bacon cheeseburger with the tasty addition of a fried egg in the mix; couple that with their bottomless french fries and you'll need to wheel yourself out of the restaurant.  I also really enjoyed the salted caramel milkshake. This was my second visit to the Brandon mall location; the first occured a couple of weeks earlier, and the service and food were really good.  I was just motivated by the excellence and follow-through of our server Natasha to write this review.  The food's good, Red Robin--if you have more wait staff like her, then the service is outstanding (and please fine-tune your seating process, kthanx).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brandon?start=100

There was not a lot of flavor and it tasted like it had been previously frozen. Next, my wife's fries, although bottomless, were very scant. The floors were so slippery and felt like I was working in a greasy kitchen as I made my way to the restroom. My youngest ordered a pasta meal and when we got the bill realized she had been charged for a large pasta. It would've been nice for the server to ask us which size we'd prefer.

Taniya F.,"Wimauma, FL",17,11,12,2.0,2/27/2014,I went here with my 2 kids and my hubby once. It was a terrible first time. We ordered the salted caramel shake which was to die for. We all got a different burgers which we all thought were mediocre. The worst part though was our service. I asked our waitress for water on 3 separate occasions and she didn't bring it to me until she brought our check. Epic fail. She also did not bus our table so we had multiple dirty plates just sitting around. I asked to speak to the manager and he gave us a free shake with our next purchase of a meal. Needless to say we will not be using that or going there again despite their very delicious milkshakes.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brandon?start=100
Nicole Leigh S.,"Tampa, FL",376,221,262,4.0,11/29/2012,"Solid 4-star on this one The only thing that keeps it dragging full marks is the service. I know they're new on their feet, but I worked at a RR in Michigan, I know their corporate training program and I honestly believe the three people who have served me since I've been should have been more on top of their game. Other things to note: save your time/money and pass on the beer here. With Brass Tap just across the way you definitely don't need to waste the cash on the mediocre selection at Red Robin. Pluses? Great vegan options, fantastic menu, and BOTTOMLESS FRIES.  Need to hear that again (because I certainly can't say it enough)? BOTTOMLESS STEAK FRIES WITH DELICIOUS RED ROBIN SPICE BLEND.

Keisha S.,"Orlando, FL",16,19,,3.0,3/14/2014,"I know everyone has had those times where they go out and wish that they had ordered something else...so goes my Red Robin experience.   This Brandon location looked to be completely swamped; however, after leaving my phone number at the hostess station, I received a text saying that our table was ready within minutes.  The atmosphere is what I would expect from a burger place; kind of family sports bar-ish.  I am not sure that I expected a full bar, but it was definitely appreciated!  This location has AWESOME domestic draft prices, and a decent drink menu.  With regards to their well known burgers, I was going to order something quite simple off of the regular menu, but I opted for the premium Smoke & Pepper burger.  It is a half pound Angus burger on ciabatta bread, with black pepper bacon, sharp cheddar, and a house made Smoke & Pepper ketchup.  The burger was decent enough, but I just think I would have enjoyed something else more.  I think I would have liked the burger more, had it not been prepared well done, as opposed to the medium well that I asked for.  Also, I could have lived the rest of my life without the tang of that Smoke & Pepper Ketchup.  It was...I guess tart would be the word.  It was extremely overpowering.  The plus side is that they do serve it on the side.  The endless fries though, were awesome, and well seasoned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brandon?start=100
Lisa B.,"Palmetto, FL",21,20,27,4.0,7/28/2015,"Our waiter, John was awesome. He was very busy on the Sunday night we chose to visit but he handled things like a pro.  He was very friendly, very professional, and very attentive especially considering how busy it was.  I ordered the select Black and Blue burger. Was very messy. The burger itself was delicious in spite of falling apart and dripping all over and I added very little of the garlic sauce they give you on the side. I ordered the sweet potato and have to say I was very disappointed. They were basically old and cold when I got them. I did not complain so cant give feedback on how this would have been handled. Daughter, husband and grand daughter enjoyed their meals very much. We ordered the chips and queso and tho the queso was yummy they only give u about a dozen chips. The chips are fresh and good but need to give more. We had to ask for more chips. When You go, you MUST order the tower of rings. Yum!!!  You get about 10 onions rings in a tower that are crispy and fresh with 2 different dipping sauces. Hubby order the bacon cheese burger and made himself finish because it was so good. Kids meal was good size for toddlers/ younger kids. Plenty of food. Staff was quick to refill drinks and bring anything we needed.

Chelsea B.,"Riverview, FL",0,4,,3.0,5/1/2014,"PROS: As a woman who is severely allergic to both gluten and dairy, Red Robin offered non dairy gluten free options to me. The bun wasn't fantastic, I'll admit that, but what really stood out to me was that they made my batch of fries separate, and they went above and beyond to make sure that my food wasn't contaminated.  CONS: The service took FOREVER. The woman who took our orders simply looked at us as though we were kindergartners. I'm in my mid twenties, and I did nothing to merit any kind of dirty look I happened to get. Slow and rude service.  Three stars.

Brandon K.,"Valrico, Tampa Bay, FL",44,121,22,1.0,3/7/2014,I will never go back to red robin again it just seems like there service has gotten so bad.  The first time coming here as you could see from previous reviews the service was great but now its horrible.  We had gotten seated and at first out waitress was great but after ordering our food we did not see her for the rest of the night.  Her helper brought us out or fries and our meals we only got one serving of drinks the whole time and we where there for a hour.  We where the only ones seated outside and she had a table on the other side of the glass so she could clearly see us and I saw her go to the other table multiple times.  Once she did come out her excuse was they got busy and I called BS on the considering they did not have a full dinning room and since we had been one of her first tables we should have been catered to more.  Her tip reflected her service. I have nothing bad to say about the food it's awesome and it's a shame that horrible service two times in a row is going to keep me away from the good food but I will not come back to this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brandon?start=120

Lee S.,"Clearwater, FL",0,11,,2.0,5/26/2013,"My sons wanted to take me to Red Robin since it had recently opened .I'll start with a positive.. the sweet potato fries are  thin and crisp . My son had a brownie mint milk shake and loved it .It was down hill after that.  I cant have spices and made that clear to the waitress.  Red Robin is known for its burgers so I assumed they were fresh made and real hand made burgers with fresh ground meat. . I ordered the Turkey burger and told them, no Red Robin spice, cant have spices at all. Turkey plain with Lettuce.  First bite revealed that this was full of spices. UGH! My mouth was hot from pepper, that much I could identify. My head tightens , I get a bubble blister in my mouth I often get from foods with chemicals, preservatives... etc. Shoot , I look at the burger and I can tell its not ""real ground turkey like I expected... its processed yuk... looks like what pink slime/mechanically separated meat.  ( google that)  . Now I am  really disappointed .. I thought it they were famous for their burgers it would be a real ground burger.  Nope. I ask for the label of the turkey so I can tell how bad this headache is going to be. Its Jennie O processed turkey with every spice and chemical. The cracked pepper was responsible for my  burning mouth , it also had garlic , onion and onion powder , dissodium insinate, bha,bht..and  on and on ..! So sad . My waitress apologized. She didn't know the burgers had all those spices and chemicals in them , she said she did tell the kitchen  not to put the red robin spices on it . She had an education too.  So if you want processed inferior  food --eat at Red Robin... just don't be fooled by the best burgers since 1969 like its a family recipe or real ground beef or turkey ... its not .. its not quality in my opinion but its dressed up with nice pictures and fancy names.  I got a headache and wasted my money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brandon?start=120
