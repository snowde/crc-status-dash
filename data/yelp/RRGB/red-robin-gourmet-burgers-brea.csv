Michael B.,"Yorba Linda, CA",16,108,47,5.0,10/18/2017,"Well its that time of the year, birthday burger time. Yes and best of all its free. Not have to buy anything, just join rewards club. Tonight was busy with cubs/dodgers game on all tvs. I was told 10 minute wait, only waited maybe 5 minutes. The hostess got my drink out asap, that was great. Then my server, Brittany, hope spelling is accurate. She was in her late teens,  early 20's (oldest) young lady.  Great personality, take charge attitude. Got my order in right away, blue ribbon burger. Actually haven't had a burger in over 30 days, saving ground meat for special occassions. I order it medium-medium rare, for sure some pink,  since it is fresh. Blue cheese crumbles, 2 slices of red ripe tomatoes, lettuce, and Mayo,,  perfect amount of crispy onion straws at the bottom, on a onion bun. With unlimited fries. Why not? Well food came out guessing 5-7 minutes, everything dialed in, on point, juicy, flavorful. Unbeknown to me the delivery person was the manager. I said wow thats fast service,  and then he asked me, will there be anything else, I replied,  yes the sweet/spicy ketchup free dipping sauce. He returned right away. My server checked on me several times. I reordered fries, and whoolah, another helper brought them fresh, in a basket, crisp and hot. Then Brittany asked, do you want your free sundae, Of course, i couldnt say no. But i asked, you dont have to sing do you? She sweetly laughed and said, no not necessary.  They had just sang behind me at another table, and frankly, id be too embarassed.  Anyways the sundae came out. Nice vanilla ice cream with some hot fudge,  whipped cream and sprinkles. Nice touch Red Robin! Upon checking out the miniture table top ipad to pay wasnt taking my rewards info correctly. No worries,  I asked Brittany, and swoosh to the rescue she grabbed it and returned 45 seconds later saying all done. This girl was on it. Great service, unfortunately the ipad has a survey you can take, but it ended without the survey. I told her no worry, im a big yelper, and nice tipper and will go over and tell the mgr. I walked towards the back, saw a manager or asst mgr. I asked, are you the manager? He replied, how can I help you? Sharp answer.  I told him about my great experience and only after I saw the man that brought my order in the back, a slim gentleman, bald, it was then this man said he's the big boss, just back from knee surgery 6 weeks ago. He was moving around really well.   Just wanted to say. Point on Red Robin Team.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea
Kelly B.,"Placentia, CA",14,17,2,1.0,12/2/2017,Wow Ordered a tavern burger came out a patty with a piece of cheese.

The I.,"Burbank, CA",4,105,301,3.0,10/12/2017,"A guest and I came here for an early evening dinner at the Brea Mall.  I ordered the 6.99 new Sir Acha Tavern Double (sriracha onion straws, American cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, spicy mayo) and comes with bottomless fries. It was pretty tasty. My guest ordered the Whiskey River BBQ Burger which also comes with the endless bottomless fries. She rarely tries a new burger on the menu, always sticks to the same one there.  We also ordered the 4.50 NachO.M.G to share, but she ended up eating 90% of it. The nachos were amazing!  We had the Red Robin Rewards which made our dinner even cheaper.  We had an interesting show next to us. A ""Tiger Dad"" scenario shouting at his daughter in Japanese supposedly. Some English parts like ""how are you grades?"" and ""what colleges are you applying to?"" Both questions in a demeaning loud manner towards his daughter. Then, kind of shouted at a passing by waitress for to go boxes before they left. Hopefully they paid for their meal, because that would have sucked.

Michae L.,"Los Angeles, CA",71,141,204,3.0,10/20/2017,Our server was great for sure but when I noticed at the end of the night that I was being charged an entertainment fee by the host just because I ask to be seated by a tv that was showing a specific game.. Come on really?? Charging a entertainment fee is ridiculous. Never heard of any restaurant do this. Minus two stars just because they forgot to mention about a fee which would be applied if you want to be seated at a specific tv. I believe your customers should be aware of these type of charges ahead of time.. My fault for not reviewing my bill before paying for it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea
David R.,"Costa Mesa, CA",388,1298,1357,5.0,10/8/2017,"Red Robin is super yummy, The bottom was french fries are the bomb baby. I love the spicy catch up this place has. I always order the Sonora chicken plate, it's super yummy and spicy ranch dressing that they have. Strawberry lemonade is pretty damn good and as I write this review I'm thinking that maybe I should go get my wife and head over and get some dinner at Red Robin. The only complaint I have about this place is I don't like how they want you to pay at the table, I seem to get fraud on my credit card just after I use their table device.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea

Silvia R.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,36,67,4.0,12/4/2017,"First time to this location- we were greeted right away by the hostess and waited about 5 minutes on Sunday evening. Our waitress was Taylor - she was very nice and attentive . Our order consist of : Kids Pepperoni Pizza , A Smoke & Pepper cheeseburger with onions rings , regular cheeseburger and I don't remember the name of the last burger but the description said something about Latin flavors lol. All the burgers were very good, seasoned and cooked well. Onions rings were very good , crispy and fresh . My sons pizza was a bit burned from the edges so we told the waitress , my son decided to still eat it ! He said he liked the little burned edges - haha. Within 5 minutes a manager came to our table and apologized and asked again if we wanted a new one. He was very nice and took the pizza off our bill. I really liked the attention they give here, everything was in a timely manner - the wait and the food. Great experience !!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea

The server left us unattended after ordering our drinks.  The tables have the touch pads to order food. It was kinda confusing. Like do you want me to order my own food or will I be taken care of.  Would have been happier eating fast food. But I was really hungry and wanted to treat my mom to a semi nice meal.  Food came out way too salty and well slow service.

Sheila J.,"Placentia, CA",251,416,2148,5.0,5/14/2016,"Tonight, we had a party of over 40 people, to celebrate the end of a joyous color guard season, with Valencia High School. They had several large tables set up for us, in the back.  Our servers were Tya and Velvet and they were awesome. Both very friendly, patient, explained how the billing would work and full of energy.  I ordered a low calorie option: a veggie burger, lettuce wrapped, with no cheese. It was hot, flavorful, and quite filling. I chose the coleslaw, for my side. Ironically, I dislike the way most slaws are made, but again, this was really good.  I plan to return here again. I love the decor, menu selection, kids cups/menu, energy, and more.

Alesia C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",738,368,606,4.0,7/18/2016,"Red Robin is one of my guilty pleasures... located inside of the Brea Mall, near Macy's Home Store. it's a great place to grab a post shopping meal at, but even if you're not shopping, the bottomless steak fries are too good to pass up! After trying a couple of burgers, the Whiskey River BBQ Burger will always be my favorite! If I'm feeling a little health conscious that day, I'll get the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Sandwich, but either way, I get the bottomless steak fries! They're so good, they always come out piping hot. Someone in my party usually gets the sweet potato fries, which are bottomless also, and I usually just grab one or two, and those are always crisp and seem freshly fried! If you don't want fries, they offer others sides too, make sure to check to see if they're bottomless or not, so you don't end up paying for an extra side! They offer some sauces free of charge, but they also have ""premium"" sauces for an extra cost. After the first or second round of fries, when you order more they come out a bit slower, but it's fine because I'll sit there and wait. No shame in my game. Overall, it's a good place to grab a meal, chat with some friends and family, and wait for extra rounds of fries!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea?start=20

At first the waitress was very attentive and great and then she kind of disappeared towards the end.  I ordered a s'more shake and Bruschetta Chicken Sandwich. When the s'more shake came out it was such a disappointment and it was definitely not as it was pictured. The sandwich was amazing but I just wish my shake was as satisfying because the price was a bit steep.

Sean E.,"Anaheim, CA",0,22,46,3.0,8/14/2016,"I love Red Robin. Great burgers + food. First time I came to the one in Brea. I came because it was my FREE BURGER month because of my Bday. If your not a rewards member DO IT! Free burger the month of your birthday, plus other offers. Ordered: FRIED PICKELS - DELICIOUS. I don't like sweet food, however it is a great combo of sweet and spicy with the spicy chiptole sauce. BLEU BURGER - I've had it before, great burger. However at this location wasnt that great. I think what bothered me was that the bun wasnt TOASTY. It just seemed so soft to me and they added some tangy sauce in mine. Not sure if it was a mistake or not. Not much Bleu cheese. SERVICE - Was normal. The waitress attended to me well and answered all my questions. She never asked if I wanted dessert though. After telling her I was getting the free bday burger, maybe she thought her tip increase went out the window. I tip my 15-20% though no matter what.  *update* they accidentally took my fork with my salad, they didn't come back to replace it at all, I was ignored. PLUS eating alone, I guess means no real big tip so no need for great service just passable service. I GUESS ONCE THEY SEE OR THINK YOUR DONE WITH YOUR FOOD, they don't check up on you anymore. Lost a STAR and lost alot of tip. Location is small, I sat by the window, if you LOVE to people watch its cool. I don't know how much I like people watching me eat, however very attractive people walking by so that was a plus.

Greg R.,"Anaheim, CA",7,7,,1.0,8/2/2017,Let me start by saying the food was great and our server was  great. What WASNT great was the hostess insulting a member of my partey quite loudly 2 different times. We were there with our son so I did not turn around to confront.

Michelle P.,"Anaheim, CA",13,94,39,1.0,12/18/2016,"I can usually say RedRobin is a 3 over all...your basic burger and beer place with bottomless fries.   In general, the service is pretty slow - unless you know someone there.  Ever since the table top ipads, has just gone down hill and there seems to be no bottom!  Last night took the cake and we will not be back.  Started out OK...got sat pretty quickly and our server Jessica was right on top of us asking us for drinks and apps - which was refreshing. I instantly had higher hopes than normal.  We were waiting on my husband to park the car - it was 530ish and the mall lot was packed.  He kindly dropped us at that curb and found parking alone.  She came over at least 3 times in 5 minutes.  My beer and our waters came out quickly.  My hubby arrived and we ordered.  At that point....downhill.  Took 10 minutes fro my husbands beer to arrive.  We asked for a basket of fries early w/ ranch and they arrived with the ranch and HAIR! We notified the MANAGER who said OK, we will get you new ones.  Thought it was a fluke..still not totally down hill. New fries showed up maybe 5 minutes later.  For a place with bottomless fries...don't they just have a guy who makes them as fast as possible?  My daughters food (5YO) arrived early...the mac/cheese and fruit.  To say there was cheese was an understatement! There were maybe 15 noodles in a drowning of cheese sauce..NOTHING like the photo and the runner said and I quote ""that is how it comes out of the bag"".  I said this was not going to fly with our daughter and could she have something else.  The same manager from before came out to ask what was wrong..we said her noodles are swimming in cheese sauce - he offered to add more noodles - not sure where he would get those, strain them from the bag? or get us new food..we said a burger plain. The fruit cup was all brown as though the fruit had been sitting out some time.    My hubby had the fish and chips and I had a banzai - both were OK but nothing to write home about.  Filled my belly - simple.  Then the bill comes.  Not only did they charge for the mac/cheese but took NOTHING off the bill for the horrible kids meal, hair in our food, and having to send stuff back.  I don't fault the waitress for the hair - it happens, but not going to bat with the manger for dollars off and making sure our bill was correct that is on her!  I left as I had enough.  My hubby stayed and all they did was take the extra kids meal off.  I told my hubby to leave 8% as that is what she will be taxed on.  We had two bad interactions that the same manager dealt with and he did nothing.  Food can be so so if the service is excellent..but this is wrong on all levels.  To boot, the placed had ample seating at 530 on a busy weekend at the mall.  Someone at corporate really needs to rethink their training, food prep and service.  If this keeps up they will be out of business.   No more! I like others I know have just decided to take our hard earned dollars elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea?start=20

Tom I.,"Placentia, CA",230,184,246,3.0,1/24/2016,"I haven't been to a Red Robin in about two years, honestly, not sure why. The last experience was exceptional, it was ok today and here's why:  I had the Pig Out Tavern burger and it was not as warm as I anticipated. I am assuming mind was made prior to my friend's and by the time they made his, it cooled down. I had a double double burger at Del Taco last night and it was much tastier.  For dessert, we had the Doh! Ring Shorty (Cronuts served with blueberry and chocolate syrups), we both agreed that it was definitely better than our burgers.  The customer service however, was on point.  Our experience was great the minute we walked in. There were two hostesses acknowledging us loud and proud as we walked in.  Although it was only 11:45 a.m., I was surprised to see how busy they were.  The good news for us, is that we were seated immediately.  In addition, our waitress took our drink orders almost immediately as well.  She was super friendly and accommodating and answered all our questions and provide recommendations as necessary. Unfortunately, the seats and utensils was kinda dirty. My seat appeared to have something that looked like some sort of gum stain on it and the knife was super dirty. It was kinda gross! As for the price, it was a great deal.  We had the Tavern for two and the price is only $15 plus you get a dessert or appetizer. With a drink, plus tip and taxes, our bill still comes out to be about  $30 because we still left a good tip. After all, we got great service, it's not the waitress fault that the burger wasn't good. I am wondering the burger wasn't so good because we order the special.  Next time, if we come back, we agree to stick with the gourmet burgers. Tips: Stick with the Gourmet Burgers, it was a lot tastier in comparison to the Special.  Customer Service: 5/5 Cleanliness: 2/5 Quality: 2/5 Price: 5/5, for what we got Quantity: 3/5, it was also pretty small",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea?start=20
Christine Y.,"Irvine, CA",182,103,18,1.0,6/8/2017,"THE WORST!!!!  I am so deeply disappointed with this location. I've come here a handful of times in the past 6 months and every time the service gets worse. I like Red Robin's ""bottomless fries"" and their burgers are decent.  But man does the service stink!! But yesterday tops every bad service experience. We get there and check in, the hostess advises us there is a about a 10-min wait. No big deal. About 10 minutes of waiting, a family of 3 come in and sit next to us. The manager walks by and waves at them. Less than 5 min later, they are seated by the manager. I asked the hostess if we got there before that family and both hostesses confirm that we were waiting before they arrived and they were not sure why the manager seated them first. A couple minutes later, the manager comes back and seats us, so again - no big deal. We waited for about 10 min before a server comes to our table and apologizes saying she wasn't aware she was assigned to our table. We place our order and it takes literally 30 minutes. So now we have been at Red Robin for a total of 50 minutes and when the food arrives, the fries are hard as a rock as if they had been sitting out for a while. It take an additional 7 minutes for my daughters food to arrive. At this point I am enraged and ask to speak to the manager, the one who sat his friends before us, and rather than apologizing, his defense for seating them first was that he came back within a couple minutes and seated us next. BUT WHY WERE THEY GIVEN PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE?! My husband and I didn't even eat our food, we refused. We were absolutely disgusted with the level of service or lack thereof.

I love Red Robin's burger but today's service was terrible after a piece of hair coming out from the bottomless fries. Now it wasn't just mixed in with the fries but I took a bite out of one and a piece of hair was stuck inside. when I told the waitress there was no apology at all. All she offered was a discount or another basket of fries. I understand that hairs could land in food but it would be nice to have an apology.

Other people walking in after us got seated before us, so I ask my boyfriend to go up to the hostess, after waiting about 15 minutes, and ask how much longer we'd have to wait. They completely forgot about us, which made us annoyed already. We sat down, waited quite some time to have the server come over and take our order.

I was very disgusted and upset because this was the second experience I had at this location finding a hair in my food. I called the manager and was given a replacement salad and offered an apology however I will not be returning to this location since it was the second time I had this issue.

I had the royal burger and it was ok - needed more flavor so I used some BBQ sauce to spice it up a bit. I think it was $10.99 which seems pretty standard for a ""gourmet"" burger with bacon and egg on it. They offer bottomless fries but beware - you cannot substitute the initial thing you get for another type or you will be charged (i.e. If you start with steak fries you can only get steak fries again and not broccoli or sweet potato fries). Checkout my pic of all the free sauces you can request. There were like only 5 in the menu but they gave us 8, which was neat.

The wait wasn't too long. Our sever was Annabelle she started off nice & talkative. We did ask about there promotion going on the 4 burgers for 6.99 each or something and she didn't really know much of it. We ended up ordering 3 BACON cheeseburgers I even pointed at the menu. And of course some people are picky so we didn't want onions, pickles, or tomato and light mayo. You would think it'll make her writing it down a bit easier but nope. Our food came out and it was nothing from what we had ordered. But a cheese burger with onions and pickles & Relish that they now put on there burgers. We immediately got her attention & mentioned it wasn't what we had ordered & hell went loose from there. Her tone of voice changed saying that's what we ordered when we clearly pointed at the menu saying we wanted BACON cheeseburgers. It was totally her fault for not getting our order right & then she tried to make it seem like we did not know what we ordered at Red Robin when we've been there multiple times! (Of course not the brea mall location). So we finally re ordered & her attitude was just coming off so rude. Saying ""what don't you want in the burger"" as if we were some difficult as customers. Next time someone has a problem or the WAITRESS got their order wrong they should just aplologize & bring them the correct food instead of trying to pick a fight because the customer should always be right. An employee will never win. & not only that but the her service after was just annoying she was trying to avoid our table & when she did stop by she was being a total smart Ass!

Nowhere on the device it says you will be billed and there is no terms of use or fee for service statement you have to agree to or click through. Unlimited fries were a joke, too. The burger came with 14 fries. Server came back and said you can pay with the touch device on the table. When I asked for more fries, she acted confused like this was the first time someone asked for a refill. 10 minutes later she came back with a mini plate that had 15 more fries on it, and said, ""Pay when you are ready, have a nice day.""

Another plate was the chicken chicken sandwich instead of the BBQ chicken wrap. Another plate was completely forgotten and not ordered at all. The food runner was confused but didn't speak English well so got the manager.  The manager asked what we ordered. Explained. I had to wait to eat so the other food could be prepared. Yum. Ice cold burnt burger. Who doesn't love that.  The waitress, Jessica, refused to come to our table again. We had to flag her several times to come back. We needed refills and silverware. Asked again. She said sure but again never came back. Finally a dinner guest went for a walk and got one herself.  Then she noticed it was dirty. Covered in a sticky sauce.  Flagged Jessica again. Reminded her if our needs and added a refill of fries. She smiled and said sure.  I'm glad I didn't hold my breath. If I had I'd be dead. She brought the fries after two more requests. Please?

It had mushrooms, provolone cheese, onion straws, and 2 different types of sauces. I usually find myself getting a spicy kind of burger like the Burnin Love, but I'd get this burger again. Ask for Well Done Fries if you like them crunchy and dip them in the sweet & spicy ketchup or their campfire sauce! Chili Chili Burger ($10): you really have to eat this burger with a fork and knife. For $2 more you can get chili cheese fries, but my BF decided not to do that. It had chili, red onions, black beans, cheddar cheese, and diced tomatoes. I didn't think anything special of it when I had a bite of it and my BF agreed that the Prime Chophouse burger was much better. Service: Andrew was great!

NEVER AGAIN will I purchase a salad at RR (if, in fact, I ever even return.....too much superior competition right here in the region).  Store management attributes the unwelcome changes to the desk jockeys at the Colorado headquarters, who apparently have never worked in, much less visited, a real world restaurant! (this comes from management at more than just this particular store) Do NOT order a salad, because they will serve it on a flat plate instead of a bowl.  Lettuce slides off onto the table, never to be touched again by humans (or course!).  Today, I was served an undercooked burger, asked for and received a replacement, which was also undercooked (obviously, that's my opinion).

Missy R.,"Orange, CA",182,111,111,2.0,2/23/2014,"Mediocre time from a mediocre chain. Then again, should there be more to expect?? Red robin has been around my life since the 90s, and it hasn't changed much since. Their burgers deliver steady acceptable food, their locations are typically convenient, but let's be honest...we all go for the endless fries. I will give them props (which is why this location has 2 and not 1 stars) for offering Boca patties that have never tasted frozen.  My friend and I ended up at this location this weekend after the revolving sushi wait list was gargantuan. Plus it was easy to order a meal to go for my friend's boyfriend.  The only comment I have on the food is attributed to a bold attempt to try something new. Red Robin released a menu of alcoholic shakes, now including BEER shakes. One of the options offered a concoction of Guinness, Jameson whiskey, and chocolate ice cream. Whiskey and ice cream are two of my foodie loves so I decided to give it a go. The drink was delivered cold in a tall draft glass. As I dove for that first sip I was met with an odd taste. What was inside my cup tasted of cream and Guinness. That was it. Not sure where the ice cream, whiskey, taste, or sugar went but it was horrid. I ended up drinking half of it just hoping there was a pot of gold on the other side. Rest assured, there was not. Now, I'm not sure if this was the bartender or the recipe. But I care to assume that Red Robin actually tastes ideas before putting them on the menu, Blegh! Other interesting things included a dead fly stuck to the inside of my menu and their ordering system going down right after we got there. Everyone in the restaurant was out of food for a while. The only redeeming factor (again besides the fries) was the staff. They're not real homey but they're always sure to be nice. All I can say about this location is, get it together man! It's experiences like this that leave nothing of higher promise to be thought of for poorly run chain operations.

The mall itself has a big food court with lots of selections, but sometimes its just nice to have a nice, sit down meal while shopping. The food here is really good. I am a fan of Red Robin and their 'gourmet' burgers. Most importantly, I am a huuuuuge fan of their sides. Bottomless steak fries, sweet potato fries, and garlic fries are where its at. Their onion rings are really good too (especially with the sauce they serve it with) but unfortunately, those are not bottomless. Womp womp. I always get the turkey burger from Red Robin because it is very tasty, juicy and delicious. The sauce they put on it is so good. The service here has been hit-or-miss for me. It's either amazing service or completely lacking. I came here a week and a half ago and had a waitress who was M.I.A. 90% of the time I was there. I never got refills for fries or drinks, or got anything else I needed at the time. Also, it took literally over 15 minutes to find someone to get our check. I got so tired of waiting, I went up to the hostess desk to ask for our check. However on my most recent visit a few days ago, our waitress was GREAT and she attended to us very well. She checked on us often, but not too often, and offered different sauce suggestions, which I appreciated very much. Our drinks were never empty and she was extremely friendly.

They have many substitutions from buns to fries. The service is great and they recently upgraded with the pay-it-and-go machines that sit on your table. It's useful device to alleviate any extra waiting time. I recommend the sweet potato fries. Although, it is at an extra cost it is worth it because they are BOTTOMLESS!

Every bite was like taking a spoonful of salt. My 5 yr old couldn't even eat his grilled chicken.  On a positive note the salad was fresh on the Cobb salad BUT THEY FORGOT THE EGG!

Last night we went in and though it was busy, like any typical Friday night, the service was exceptionally bad. Our servers name was Jess, maybe she was new but she is just not a good server. She wrote down our orders and asked what dipping sauces we wanted though she brought everyone Ranch with every order. I asked her 3 times during our meal to bring me the dipping sauces I had requested during the ordering process that she asked me what I wanted. Look, if you write it down it shouldn't be hard to bring it to the table. After the 3rd time of asking for my sauce and her returning to my table without it once again we told her to just forget it since I only had 2 fries left. My daughter ordered a kids cheese pizza and they brought her a pepperoni pizza. We waited an extra long time for our food and then they proceed to bring the order incorrectly. My 6yr old daughter held back tears because she was so hungry and now had to wait longer. This pissed me off even more. We choose to wait to eat our food until the correct pizza was delivered to our table. We ordered 2 beers just as the food was being delivered and they weren't brought to the table till all of our meals were nearly done. I work in customer service and I have done so for the last 15 years. I manage over a large group of staff and service like this would not be acceptable at all. Red Robin management needs to retrain or coach this server and all their servers for that matter so that they can properly serve their customers as they come in to enjoy their meals.

We waited 20 minutes to be sat because they were crammed packed according to the hostess.  In that time we saw 1 couple leave and yet when we got sat there must have been 30-40 tables available. Waited about another 10 minutes to get our server to take the drink order, and we ordered the food at the same time.  I requested that my son get his milk as soon as possible.  About 20-25 minutes later our food came out, mine lacked the sauce and everything was cold and the fries soggy.  None of our drinks had still come out, including my son's milk. Eventually, the drinks came out, and my beer on tap came in a bottle.  Still haven't seen our waitress since we put in our order.   We decided we were in too much of a rush at this point to deal with it, so we didn't send anything back, but about another 20 minutes after we got our food we finally get our waitress and she asks if we want more fries.  My wife says no and begins to ask for a box and a refill of our son's bottomless milk and before she gets 2 words in the waitress leaves.  Then we're supposed to pay via the kiosk on the table (which by the way, is annoying because it takes up valuable table space and apparently is an excuse to provide lousy service and still demand a tip) and it's out of paper so the receipt can't print.  So then I have to hunt down our MIA waitress to get a receipt printed anyway.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea?start=80

On all three occasions I had to be the one to initiate the conversation and tell her how many were in the party. One time I also asked how long the way would be, she told me, and then just stood there staring at me as if it had put her out entirely. She'll take you to your table, put your menus down, and walk away as if she was doing you a favor.

After an intense Saturday night of watching Lion King in 3D and taking a few shots of Patron, my friends and I woke up in a famished frenzy. We decided to go to Red Robin's since I had never been there before, and I love burgers :D - Appetizer: chili con queso - it's a melted cheese dip with cilantro and chili. It was really salty, but pretty tasty. The huge ""chip"" things are deceiving! They're not good at all. Just eat the normal chips - Drink: Very Berry Raspberry Limeade - free refills! Tastes like sweet and sour soda. Comes out in really girly glasses, so men: watch out! haha - Burger: Guacamole Bacon Burger on Ciabatta bread, medium (I wanted medium rare, but I guess due to safety regulations they can only go medium or more well done). Normally I would've gobbled it down; it looked so good, but the previous night's activities totally put my taste buds on a break. Couldn't taste much, but when I ate later at home, it was delicious. I can only imagine how much better it would've been if I had been able to eat it at the restaurant. We waited less than10 minutes; service in general was pretty good. They were obviously busy, so it took a while to get our refills and food, but all in all, very nice.  They have bottomless fries, but I coudln't take advantage of that since we didn't really have an appetite. You can also switch out those fries for other sides! This is a good idea to consider if you're there with friends, so you can eat their fries and get something else :P P.S.

We go out just about every Sunday night and Red Robin used to be one of our regular places to go, although we have not been back for a while. But, last night will be our last. I don't know if is staffing issues or just poor training, but things are just not the same at Red Robin. Despite a number of empty tables, we were told it would be a five minute wait. And they did make us wait five minutes before they seated us. To add to the confusion, they no longer bring silverware and napkins when they seat you. You have to ask for these later. Can you imagine trying to eat a burger without a napkin, or fish without a fork? And the wait staff seem to disappear to the back so my wife had to go up front to get napkins. The staffing shortages seem to extend to the kitchen as well. The time between ordering and receiving your food has certainly extended. Most of the folks around us passed the time on their cell phones. The food quality also varies. My Burning Love Burger was great; same Red Robin burger quality. But, my wife's Fish & Chips was way below par. RR used to produce one of the best Fish & Chips plates around. But, now they have joined the crowd by producing thin over-battered mushy fish.

Tae K.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/18/2016,"I guess this is my first time feeling economic discrimination from a restaurant. It was my wife's birthday two days ago. Per tradition, me and my wife go to Red Robin for a free burger. We usually really enjoy this benefit as a customer. We generally like Red Robin burgers. However, this time I have never felt such disrespect. My poor wife went to the entrance, asked if we still have a free burger, perhaps because the benefit expired. We did not look nice as our clothes were disheveled and did not look too presentable as we were busy doing some other chores. The manager approached my wife, took the Red Robin card, returned and shouted at my wife ""Read it!"" My wife was startled. ""Excuse me?"" She was scared. ""Read the receipt!"" She was a little appalled by that comment. Turns out there was a free burger. He walked away. Sheepishly, she asked if she can have the free burger and an extra burger (paid) to-go. Both to be cooked well done. The waitress took the order, and thereafter, when the receipt came, and my wife asked what the total was, the waitress said, ""It's on the receipt!"" Lol... what is wrong with these people and receipts...? I don't understand. When we came home, we opened up the burger, turns out it was so severely undercooked that we had to throw half away. Really a sad birthday night for my wife. Obviously, I can't prove they were discriminating against us because we looked poor, but I just can't help but feel this way based on just simple observation.

Brandon M.,"Fullerton, CA",24,153,7,5.0,6/13/2013,"5 stars is what Red Robin in Brea deserves as that is truly as good as it gets! I have yet to visit this location and experience anything but perfect food and service. I have been a customer for YEARS, and plan on continuing... There is something about this location that attracts me to it. I've been to Red Robins throughout OC/LA, and none can compare... To start, the first thing you take note of with any restaurant is parking and then the environment once going in. Parking can be a hit and miss since this location is at the Brea Mall. But since I ride a sport motorcycle, I always park on the sidewalk next to the door (assuming security doesn't get at me over it - which they haven't so far). The environment is always clean, family oriented, and as it should be. They have plenty of TV's, which is a big plus for me during the NFL season. Next would come the customer service. They always have someone at the front desk to greet you and reserve your seating. When they give time estimates for your wait (assuming there is a wait), they are almost 100% accurate (sometimes a table frees up sooner then expected). Once seated, the waiters are usually on it - offering some of the best service out there. To finish it up, the food is amazing. The menu offers great variety for any eater. Naturally, I love the burgers that come with endless fries - you can never go wrong with that. And you cant go wrong with their milk shakes, if you are out for a nice treat. To top everything off, the prices aren't half bad compared to their competitors. Having the red royalty card (giving you a free burger after buying 9 and a free burger for your birthday) is always pleasant as well.. In all, this red robin is a great spot to eat.

From the first moment she approached our table, I could tell our server would have rather been anywhere else, like the DMV or the dentists' chair.  She was extremely curt, spoke quickly, and sounded like she was reading from a script.  No smile, no warmth, no.... anything.  Our food was dropped off by someone else, who smiled.  That was nice. Shortly after the food was brought out, our check was dropped off by Ms. Personality while we were still eating.  Too bad my son had asked for ice cream after dinner; I had to run by 7-11 for a Dove Bar on the way home.  So, I was only able to glance at the server's name on the check... Alessa, Alessia, Alyssa... something like that.  I really hope it was just a very bad day for her, or hope she graduates soon and finds a career she's happy about. As for the food, my Burnin Love burger (sub grilled chicken) probably would've been a lot better if it wasn't topped with ICE COLD breaded & fried jalapenos.  Seriously, after the first two bites I was like WTF - what is so dang cold on my burger?  I pulled it apart and quickly found the breaded, soggy, recently thawed jalapenos.  NOT NICE!  And my burger patty wasn't exactly hot either.  My son's pizza was all doughy and white, too.  It was like pepperoni & cheese on top of half-baked Pillsbury refrigerated pizza crust in the can.  He usually eats 3 - 4 pieces of a large Dominos pizza but ate less than half of this small kids portion. Why am I even giving two stars?  Hmmm... I'm not sure.  I guess because I had a nice time visiting with my cousin's lovely wife and their gorgeous chubby baby!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea?start=140

Food here is pretty good. I always order their Whiskey River Chicken Burger.  Nice, juicy piece of chicken breast served with lettuce, tomato, cheese, onion straws and BBQ sauce!  Deelish!  Garlic fries are amazing here.  I love how they have actual chunks of garlic on them and are sprinkled with shredded parmesan cheese :)  So good!  Their strawberry freckled lemonade is also something I highly recommend.  It is a perfect blend of sweet and tangy.  I love how they put lots of strawberries in your glass.  It's so refreshing! I always have a good dining experience at Red Robin!  Food is good and service is always great!  Don't waste your time/money at yucky places like Applebee's or Chili's.  YUCK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea?start=140

It was so deliciously balanced.  I might be dreaming but theres a salsa-y touch under the guac creaminess combined with the crispy lettuce and the savory beef.  Its too good. Love it. The water on the other hand....tasted as bad as a bathroom smells.  Its a great incentive to buy a soda or something.  I even had two lemons in there to mask the metallic taste that usually comes with restaurant water, did not help at all. Waitress was ok, seemed nice but I think she was spread out cuz she rarely came by to check on our table.  We did get refills in a timely manner but she didn't offer any condiments with our fries, plus didn't refill our fries till after she brought out the check like she wanted us to close out the check...i guess we looked like we were done.  We ignored the check standing on our table edge since at that time we werent done, we did want more fries.  She actually asked if we wanted to settle the check when she came around and we hadn't touched it.  Maybe she's in a hurry to close it?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea?start=160

Food came quickly and the server was already prepared with a fifty million sauces AND two extra baskets of bottomless fries. Ordered my usual Sauteed Shroom Burger with a little bit of pink. It was perfect! Tips I've learned from a Red Robin master: -Always ask for the fries to come out right after you order -Ask them to cut your burger in half -Make sure you try the Campfire sauce (this magical mixture is believed to be part Mayo part BBQ sauce) What else can I say?

Apparently, Red Robin changed their provider for the birthday program a few months ago, but we still got the emails this last week and arranged for a sitter today so we could go. We were very up front and gave the certificates to the server as we ordered. We ordered drinks, and shortly after they arrived, the manager came to our table and informed us that our certificates were from the old program and no longer valid, even though we had just received the certificates from their former business partner. I asked where that left us, and he said that we would be pay full price for our meal. I told him that in that case, we were leaving, and her told our server to charge us for the drinks that we had barely even sipped.  No heated exchange, just a complete lack of customer service.

When they bring your food they ask if they can get you anything else. Very polite.) Anyway, the bottom of the bun was so soggy I couldn't pick it up. This means it sat under the heat lamp too long.

(It wasn't busy - only 2 other tables occupied, plus 3 guys at the bar) so don't know why the waitress felt she didn't need to check on us. Finally got her attention and told her about the soggy sandwich so she took it back. She brought a fresh one. This one wasn't soggy but it also didn't have any teriyaki sauce on it.  And looked like it had been slapped together with abandon because it didn't hold together very well, with everything piled in the center.  We just ate it anyway.  And the whole time we were there the waitress never once asked if she could refill our iced tea, so half the meal was eaten dry.  She finally came over when we were done eating and asked if we wanted more iced tea.  Bottom line, I will NEVER go here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea?start=180

While I can't speak for the drink, my family vouches for the strawberry lemonade, also refillable.  You may even catch yourself double-fisting this drink--you've been warned. Just as a side note, not every Red Robin follows suit to these guys, but they do set the bar pretty high.

My friend and I have been craving for the BOTTOMLESS GARLIC FRIES here and we just couldn't shake it off until we got our fix. So off we go to fill the void. I order my usual Red Robin Royal (the burger with the fried egg on it) and he orders the Whiskey River BBQ burger... both, of course, with said garlic fries. My friend orders a freckled lemonade. I was kinda on the fence with it, but given that I'm about shave a good 5 years off of my life with my epic meal already, I decided to opt for a water. So back to the waitress-- She gives us a basket of garlic fries WITH ranch while we wait for our food. Score. But it doesn't stop there. She refills the fries faster than we were eating them AND was on point with the drinks and even ranch dip refills too!  I am not used to such amazing service. (Then again, we normally eat in Rowland Heights... the land of disgruntled restaurant employees) Here's the kicker: After our meal she gives us a basket of garlic fries to go AND she gave BOTH of us two large cups of the freckled lemonade to go!! I didn't even order one! At this point, I'm starting to think she was either crushing on either one of us or is just in a really good mood because this was borderline flirting! (lol kidding.)

The sauce (has it's own section in my review) You have the typical which are good in their own right Ketchup BBQ sauce And your second level of sauces that may not be so well known Ranch Honey Mustard And then the what on earth, never would have thought sauces Buffalo (favorite) campfire Buffalo sauce needs to be coupled with Ranch and only a selected few will like it, but if you manage to discover it and fall in love with it like I have, then this review was worth writing.

Stephanie C.,"Brea, CA",15,48,32,5.0,5/9/2011,"Recommended/Favorites: - Freckled Lemonade (unlimited refills) - Garlic Parmesan Fries (unlimited refills and only 50 cents extra if your meal comes with normal fries) - Royal Red Robin Burger (eggs bacon and cheese!) - Banzai Burger (pineapple teriyaki) - Chicken Parmesan pasta - Quesidilla (it's an appetizer but might as well be a meal!) - Chicken ala Caprese entree (mozzarella, bread, salad and chicken) - Salmon burger I Wait All Year for: - Gingerbread Milkshake Not Good: - Spicy Avocado Chicken Wrap (sweet n sour sauce, chili sauce, wasabi sauce..? luckily they've already taken it off their menu!) - Not really into their coleslaw that comes with some of their seafood dishes... - I'm also not really into their spinach dip because sometimes the chips are stale, and it's kind of small. Can ask the staff to change the chips out though. Service:  - Always quick and helpful! - Once I came for a friend's birthday and I think my food came out 2 minutes later than everyone else. I didn't even notice, but the manager personally came to apologize and said I didn't have to pay because it was late. - This might not be good, but it gives them such a huge plus from me. The waiter/manager accidentally dropped Italian salad dressing into my lap (was wearing some cheap drawstring nylon shorts). He felt so bad and apologized so much, but I didn't mind since I live nearby (and it wasn't on my purse or anything). But he actually had one of the staff go to the mall and buy me a NEW pair of shorts on the house! They were really cute!! He also waived our entire meal. I know some people will say ""DUH! THEY SHOULD HAVE TO DO THAT!"" but not many actual restaurants would do that for a customer. It was very nice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea?start=180
Aubrie O.,"Orange County, CA",143,95,14,2.0,12/11/2011,This is a big chain restaurant and generally I feel off about writing reviews for these because your experience can change drastically just based on service since the food remains the same at all locations. This review is going to be for the bar area during happy hour and not the actual restaurant. My group and I arrived a few minutes before their happy hour was to start at 8pm. We managed to grab one of the last tables in the bar and wait it out. None of us had been to a happy hour here so we were looking at the bar menu to see what we wanted. We noticed the prices for the food wasn't that great. We are regulars at El Torito happy hour where appetizers are 50% off. Here you are only going to save 50 cents to a dollar on food.  The reality of it though is people are going to go to happy hour to drink and not eat! We looked at the drinks and beer was a really good deal. I think the largest size they sell was $3 to $5. Mixed drinks was another story. They advertise $3 well drinks and since a lot of us weren't fans of beer we decided to go with the well drinks. They weren't that great and were served in rock glasses so after 3 drinks it was gone and you needed another one. I think I just discovered how they make back all their money! They also advertise a $3.50 margarita so a friend got one of those. When we got the bill we discovered that instead of the margarita being $3.50 he was charged $10. When he asked the bartender about it he was rudely told he should have specified happy hour margarita and there was nothing that could be done now about it.  I don't think we will be coming back for happy hour but I still love the food they sell at the restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea?start=180

The burgers are great, and that's what they're known for, however the rest of their menu is lacking. I've tried the fish and chips here, and just not worth it. My friends and coworkers have tried other dishes from their menu and they didn't enjoy it one bit and it was not appetizing to look at.

The girl who took our order was nice, but the waitresses were all over the place! No routine whatsoever.... There were 3 different couples who walked in after us at the bar. Sat down, didn't get acknowledged either and they ended up leaving. There are still tabs on the bar from the previous people who were eating. When we finally were able to order we had no napkins, no silverware and again everyone was running wild all over the place. This is really unfortunate cause we really love this place. The waitresses need to get better, much better! It doesn't stop here..... So then we get our food, I specifically ask for regular onions ( no red onions please) and no tomato.

I observed him going above and beyond in his duties with all the other customers too - opening doors for all the guests, taking group photos for people enjoying their outing, and greeting everyone with the same friendly smile. This guy just seemed like he really genuinely enjoyed his job. Rare to find in the food industry if you ask me.  Ten more minutes later and he came out with my order to go.  When I got home, I was pleasantly surprised to see that I received a free order of steak fries to go along with my free burger. Awesome! Counting my drink from earlier, I basically got a free meal!

Katherine K.,"Berkeley, CA",7,64,,5.0,5/30/2011,"I always have such a good time when I go to Red Robin. Maybe it's the company (I always go with the same people), maybe it's the fact that I've been going since I was 12, or maybe it's the food. Or the service. Or the servers. Or all of the aforementioned. Anyways, the food's great. It's pretty hard to mess up burgers, fries and salads which is the majority of what they sell.  The servers are the best. Always really attentive and really nice. Last time I went, my friend wanted to use that iPhone app to recognize the song that was playing on the stereo system. Right when he pulled it out, the song stopped. We flagged down a waitress and when she didn't remember what song we were talking about, she tried to get them to turn the CD back to the track. There were some tech problems and they couldn't, but she asked other workers and they figured it out for us. I think THAT'S customer service. Always clean and cool in the restaurant.

The server during our was almost no where to be seen for almost 20-25 minutes at a time and never checked to see how our food was. Entrees: Royal Red Robin burger - cooked to my liking. Hot and crispy fries Guacamole bacon burger - over cooked. Fries like they were left out in the cold after its been cooked the first time then fried again. Plus drinks. Bill came out to $35. Overall not a bad deal. Only reason why I am giving them one star is because I over heard the manager tell guests at another table that all the proteins that are on the menu for example - chicken, hamburger, turkey patty, etc.  Is cooked on a conveyor belt oven.

Ryan G.,"Los Angeles, CA",221,3,,1.0,1/12/2014,"My roommate and I decided to go out to eat on a Sunday and had several choices to choose from for dinner. We didn't want nothing too fancy or any fast food. We decided to go to Red Robin, since it was fairly close and we haven't gone to the restaurant out here. We are both from out of town and training out here in Brea for work so choosing where to go should be special. We got to the location and the restaurant was really slow around 715pm. We did not get greeted at the host stand, instead 2 minutes after waiting, we got asked by a server walking by initially ignoring the host stand, if ""we even helped yet"". (You would think 2 men standing at the host stand we're not looking at architecture in the restaurant for all sakes, of course we need to be HELPED!) Finally after 3 minutes a random waitress that didn't ask if we needed help initially sat us. The entire restaurant was empty, but of course she decides to put 2 grown men in the only section packed full with 2 tables full of small infants; nothing against infants but there was no room for us to sit nor able to enjoy with crying babies surrounding us. I asked to be seated in a booth and luckily we got that request fulfilled. Literally 10 seconds after we sat in the booth we were asked by our waitress Yvonne if we were ready to order ( while she is asking this, she looked panicked and worried about getting more tables sat rather than any personal service to us). She then realized we just sat and asked if we wanted to start with any alcoholic beverages or lemonade. We both ordered a water and immediately the expression on her face turned bitter in disgust because she was probably having the perception we were cheap and not going to make any money off of us. She brought out the 2 waters and we got to order an appetizer and 2 entrees. The appetizer came out very promptly, but the wait staff seemed uncaring and had a kitchen worker that did not say one word to us when he dropped off our appetizer. This gentleman also brought out our entrees and did not acknowledge or say a word to us too, just literally dropped the food on the table and walked away. While in the process of eating we got near empty with our water glasses. Without even exaggerating, it took 15 minutes for them to be refilled; take in consideration Yvonne stared at our glasses 3 times walking by and did not even acknowledge them. Yvonne did not speak a word to us from the time we ordered our food to until she asked if we wanted dessert. Yvonne seemed like she only wanted tips and upsells to get more money. We finally got our check and when she dropped it off (before we even paid) she said in a hurried manner ""thanks for coming in bye"", while she stared at the table sat next to us with 4 guests probably having dollar signs in her eyes. I even overheard her say to the guests a statement that is horrible to hear in the restaurant business of ""we don't carry that anymore, corporate took that away""; what a total slap in the face of the company! This was probably one of the few times I did not leave a tip and felt alright doing a gesture like this for as bad as our experience was. I work in hospitality also and always tip generously, but Yvonne or Red Robin did not earn my money during this experience . I wish my roommate and I decided on a different place rather than the Red Robin, since it left us feeling like the worst experience of service since being here in California.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea?start=200

Helen K.,"Fullerton, CA",8,60,,4.0,10/14/2008,"I wanted to hug my server... yes, I think I've had bad service with a frown a bit too often.  The server was friendly, helpful and had so much energy considering it was about 8pm! The restaurant itself is situated as a part of the mall with an entrance outside and an entrance inside the mall that closes when the mall closes.  This makes the parking mall parking and it's situated between the two Macy's stores.  I've found the parking here to be reasonable (so far, please don't all park here now).  I hadn't been to Red Robin in about fifteen years so I wasn't completely clear what to expect, just that it's a casual chain restaurant.  My mother-in-law had raved about the fish-n-chips at the Red Robin by Carmel Mountain, so I decided to give it a try by us (I've been craving fried seafood since we got back from Boston!). Ok, I tried the infamous Freckled Lemonade... I literally have the menu in front of me and am hitting myself for not noticing that they have a ""light"" version where they use Minute Maid Light Lemonade with it.  Duh.  I found the regular Freckled Lemonade to be too sweet.  I'm not a huge fan of sweet drinks (although I have a strange weakness for fruit flavored soda, probably about as artificial as it gets), so this didn't do it for me.  I may try the ""light"" version next time... we'll see.  So for those that are not fans of drinks that are a bit sweet, go for the light version. In my goal to test the limits of my arteries, I ordered the Shrimp & Cod Duo... basically battered and deep fried shrimp and cod, and fries.  Interestingly, they use different breading between the shrimp and the cod.  I found the shrimp to be whatever, with the breading on it being the harder crust.  The cod had the thinner breading but was equally fried.  The dish comes with tartar and cocktail sauce.  I think that maybe they could have switch the cocktail sauce to marinara for the shrimp, the flavor didn't seem to mesh as well with the cocktail.  The Hubby ordered the BLTA (bacon, turkey, tomato, avocado) croissant, it was yummy. The restaurant is at the level of an Islands with a little more variety than Islands (I have not stepped into a TGIF in about 18yrs).  I've been taking my nephews there when we babysit them, we are going to switch to Red Robin.  I'm sure I'm bound to order pasta there, although I know I'm going to be disappointed I just can't seem to help myself.  For sandwiches, burgers and probably salads, they're a good choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea?start=240

Gina Q.,"Whittier, CA",17,705,136,5.0,8/14/2007,"Great service and quick. The other night I came here for dinner and got seated right away. The first thing I noticed was that one of the employees happened to be right by the door to let us in. She opened the door with a large welcoming smile and got us seated very quickly. Our waiter was very friendly and took care of us very well. He brought me a second soda when my first soda was just about gone. The food  was tasty and fresh quality.  I ordered the Bleu Ribbon Burger. Mmmmm. Love that bleu cheese. It was loaded with bleu cheese and some sort of bbq sauce with french fried onions. Oh, it was tasty. My friend ordered the Whisky BBQ Chicken Wrap. It's one of his favorites and never disappoints with it oozing bbq sauce, grilled chicken, and cheese. Plus you get ranch dressing for extra dipping.  It's a great place to just hang out too. I will come back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea?start=240

My favorite is the Whiskey River BBQ burger with Boca and the endless fries. Okay, let's face it- I could make a meal out of their fries. Grab their seasoning salt. ask for a side of their Campfire Sauce, and get ready for a party in your mouth. I'm indifferent to their garlic fries, but my friends are in love with them.

The food was okay.  My fries were not hot the way they should be, but daughter's food came out decently.  Her melon slices looked quite fresh. Yay.  I would have liked much more BBQ sauce on my Whiskey River Chicken burg, so actually asked for a side of the sauce for dipping. Blake delivered everything with a smile and extremely pleasant attitude.  Heated my coffee several times also.  Wow.  I am having hope for this family-style eatery.   Thank you, Blake.  I am happy there are still people who take pride in their jobs.  You need to be promoted to head trainer/lead manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea?start=220

Yes, I know I can order the Banzai burger with onion strings but I don't. Dan loves, loves, loves the Fish and Chips. They are the best, here!

After waiting about 20 minutes for a table, my parents decided they'd rather eat at the food court and so, off they went. My cousins on the other hand were adamant about eating here. 5 young adults, almost every server's worst nightmare....ALMOST.   Who hates it more? People working at the restaurant who are older than you and working as hosts.... Clearly, that was her issue.  Scenario: Host takes us to our table, drops the menu's down. Walks away. She doesn't even speak to us or do her part in picking up the bill left by the previous party. (lucky for her, another server picked that up after she walked away) 5 minutes later she comes back...""What'd you do with the check?"" Family: ""Excuse us?!"" Host: (ignores our question and our looks of disgust and shoves menus on our table aside and ""looks"" for the check)....walks away. Family: WTF was that? What a bitch. At this time, I'm fuming, and my cousins are pissed.  I felt sorry for our server because he had to serve a table of people who were already unhappy. Service was good, but our experience? not so much.... We spoke to manager...and although he seemed sincere, i doubt anything was done...

The parmesan/garlic fries might be a little too much flavor for some people.  I prefer the regular fries... not as greasy. If I don't get the sliders, I do the crispy chicken sandwich.  Also awesome.

Though, I'd only recommend one person from your party get the bottomless fries deal because it is really filling and not really worth it because I only got one refill for it. But that depends on how many people you go with. I went with four people. Though the food was great and filling, our server was really bad. She had a big attitude and she was rushing us! When we were paying, I forgot about my receipt and took my credit card as fast as I can, and she was like ""Should I come back in a minute?"" I'm like.... wth, she should patiently wait or come back later to get it, you know? Well, we got tired of her attitude so we sat there just to talk more and we felt like getting the fries refill again, so we told this other server and she was really kind to get us more and we personally tipped her two dollars in cash even though she was not our server.

You can't really complain about the bottomless fries or the awesome strawberry-lemonade. It's also a great place to be when you're going out with a large group of friends after a long day. The environment is really stress free and friendly to the point where you can just drop all your worries. I also highly recommend their honey-mustard sauce and the campfire sauce for the never ending fries, and yes I cannot stress the infinity of the fries enough. It's not only good because it's unlimited, but the quality and size of the fry makes it completely delectable. The biggest down side to it all is the bill. Sadly the bill always ends up weighing more than it should be. But I find that enough motivation to take advantage of the fries and refillable lemonade and sodas. Definitely a great place to be, but just make sure you got cash to kinda splurge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea?start=260
