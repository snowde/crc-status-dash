Lisa N.,"Orlando, FL",152,316,1241,4.0,11/16/2017,"I haven't been to a Red Robin in ages, but we decided to go on Veterans Day to take advantage of their free burger offer for my bf who's a veteran. Conveniently my birthday is in November so I was able to join their loyalty program and also get a free birthday burger. We went at 9pm on Saturday and were initially told it would be a 30 min wait, but it ended up only being about 10 minutes. Our server was very upbeat and friendly. I'm not a vegetarian but I don't eat beef. Initially I was leaning toward a turkey burger, but the veggie burger caught my eye. Our server said they had just revamped it to be a lot better than their previous version, so I decided to give it a try. I loved all the components of the veggie burger and it tasted great. Red Robin has several dipping sauces for the fries - some are free and some have a slight upcharge. We liked the ranch and campfire (creamy BBQ), but weren't fans of the Red's secret tavern sauce. Overall we enjoyed our visit to Red Robin. While our meal this time was free (and yes we did tip the server well), the menu prices are very reasonable and we would go back. Edit: Forgot to add that my bf was given a nice thank you card for Veterans Day, that was hand signed by several of the employees. I thought this was a very thoughtful gesture.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood
Heidi S.,"Brentwood, CA",44,14,11,2.0,12/18/2017,"There were hardly any people in here tonight - sat at the bar and ordered food - after waiting for over 20 minutes we noticed food that looked like ours sitting in the window - at least 4 different servers walking past, bringing out their orders not giving it any attention.  Finally flagged a person to see if it was ours, that it had been sitting for sometime. She went to the window, put the back of her hand on it to check the (lack of heat) 2 other servers then proceeded to do the same before sending one back...nice.. (Not) paid our drink bill and went elsewhere. Lame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood
Mark H.,"Castro Valley, CA",1,28,39,1.0,12/13/2017,"I usually go somewhere at least a couple of times before I leave a review. We've tried this place a few times & they just don't have it. From the slow service, DIRTY menus & dirty flatware (IF you get them before your meal & don't have to get them yourself like we've had to, TWICE). To my meal coming out wrong a couple times and the super long wait, to the point I don't eat because my wife & children are done & waiting. Last week the Fryer was out French fries available), but NO ONE says anything until you are about to order (after the 20+ min wait to be seated). The Manager says there's a sign on the door (small printout that was blocked by WAITING patrons). The TWO young ladies who were hostesses didn't say a word when taking our name OR while seating us (without flatware & napkins). We still order & wait & wait, then our food is cool AGAIN. After the usual oh, ""I'm sooo sorry"" & a long wait, my wife ate her burger, but I like mine hot & I did NOT eat dinner. AGAIN. Just go anywhere else & save the hastle of the ""Red Robin Lottery"". You might get a halfway decent meal, or you may not get one at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood

Mich B.,"Elk Grove, CA",6,58,76,1.0,11/12/2017,"The service here is typically hit or miss, but our service today was very underwhelming. We had a party of 7, and although the waiter initially acted as though he was eager to be helpful, it really fell off after we ordered. 5 of the 7 entrees came out and after he placed the food at the table, he looked at us and said ""everyone got everything, right?"" and began walking away. We had to call after him to let him know we were waiting on two more. We also asked for more fries and he assured us over and over ""I got you, I got you"" and went to the kitchen and loudly yelled our fry order, as if to overcompensate.. which was even more unfortunate because he never brought it out. After we ate it took a long time to ask for boxes, and then we told him we planned to pay with cash and he told us to use the device on the table and quickly walked off. It took another 5 minutes before he came by again and once more he told us to do everything through the device (???) and walked away. He eventually walked by and we just handed him the cash and left.  It's possible that the establishment was understaffed but the service was more lacking than usual.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood
Lidiyanna Z.,"Oakley, CA",0,38,30,2.0,12/17/2017,"Not impressed. Not satisfied. They took so long to make our order. Burger tasted just ok, edible, but the fries were not fresh, hot and crunchy. The only reason I might come back here is because they are open late.  We quickly forgot about this below average place as soon as we went to see Star Wars in AMC/IMAX theater nearby)) So the date was still good, even though the Supreme Leader and Luke Skywalker had to die to make it good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood
Jeff H.,"Lodi, CA",40,5,,1.0,11/15/2017,"This review is for Red Robin's pick up or ""2 go"" service. Attempted to do a pickup order on two different occasions, as our dining experience here is as to be expected for a chain restutant. 1st experience we decided to call in our order, an appetizer, 2 adult meals and a kids meal. For 1 of the adult meals a special request was made to exclude items from the meal, pretty typicasl and no hesitation from the order taker. Was quoted 20 minutes. I arrived 25 minutes later, and our meal wasn't ready. 15 minutes later they come out with the meal. I immediately check the special order, and it's wrong. So another 10 minutes to make it right. I was offered a free shake that I accepted for the trouble. After getting our meal and arriving home I learned that the other adult meal wasn't even what we asked for, I simply didn't check because it should have been straight forward. I called back and the Manager agreed to refund our meal onto a gift card and send it to us. I agreed. Never received the gift card. Our 2nd experience tonight I decided to do an online order that said my meal, special requests and all, would be done in 17 minutes. I arrived 25 minutes later and was told they were bagging up my order. 15 minutes later I had to ask again, finally my order came out, it was correct but the fries were cold. I was told it would take 10 minutes for new fries. Seriously!? You advertise everywhere bottomless fries, even McDonald's has fries on stand by at all times. While our typical experience at Red Robin is not the most amazing experience it is certainly better than what we received attempting their ""2 go"" service. Stick to dine in, expect typical chain restutant service, but hopefully the wait, order, and temperature of your food will be whats expected.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood

cheryl j.,"Pleasanton, CA",3,11,10,2.0,12/13/2017,"We came to Red Robin to get lunch one day and I ordered the whiskey river bbq burger and asked for a side salad instead of fries. When our food came out I noticed the salad looked funny, First I noticed the lettuce was not cut good at all, It was in really big pieces and did not look like something you'd expect to get from a restaurant. Then I noticed it had brown wilt marks all over the lettuce. Upon further inspection I just noticed there was a BUG on the lettuce! I almost would have ate it if I had not been examining it. I was so disgusted that I almost ate this bug. I told the waitress I wanted fries instead since my salad had bugs in it! So she brought the fries and notified the manager. Manager apologized and said they threw the salad out and if we wanted anything else. We said we'd have a dessert that was on the house for the mishap and she also took $10 off the bill. It was a nice gesture but still it sucks that their food quality was so poor that they would serve not fresh food, I'm just glad I didn't eat it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood

The pineapple and Teriyaki mixed with a little ketchup is like a Mardi Gras in my mouth! I'm getting excited thinking about this right now... And it's only 7 am.

Fer R.,"Oakley, CA",237,344,1814,5.0,4/16/2017,I have mostly always had a great meal experience here it this location. Weather with family or with the girls. This experience was myself and my kids. We ordered the PRETZEL BITES w/caramel and also w/cheese. YUMMO!! We really enjoyed them with the caramel. Warm salty lil bites and sweet caramel is such a great mixture! The nacho cheese was nasty though. Yuck. Would totally advise you NOT to get the cheese. I don't even think it was actually the queso cheese used on their VooDoo fries. Something different. I ordered a red Spanish sangria and the Big Pig Out Tavern burger w/sweet potato fries. Sweet potato fries are an additional cost if you don't want the unlimited steak fries. Its 2 patties with 2 bacon pieces and bacon aioli! Typical fixins and American cheese. Man was it a big burger! Meat was made to my liking (med. rare) and the fries were hot and freshly prepared.  Kid #1 got the Reds burger and #2 got cluck-a-doodles (chicken tenders). Ryan was our server.

Bobby R.,"Dublin, CA",2,6,1,1.0,9/26/2017,Our visit was pleasant up until our food came out. Our server although new to the job was excellent. We ordered one of the Avo-Cobb salads similar to the one in the menu with lots of avocado and other fixings to match its name. Then the plate came out with a pair of slices from a baby avocado paired with tons of salad mix and a decent chicken breast. When asked for a few extra slices of avocado we were informed it would be an added charge. When asked to have the picture match the plate the manager informed us they serve each plate with 1/4 of an avocado per plate.  Please be the judge for yourself of their replacement plate offering compares to their own advertising.

I was seated quickly and the man who greeted me and my party was very friendly but from there, the rest of the experience went downhill. We had two waitresses, both of whom made ordering a bit difficult and confusing when it shouldn't be. After waiting a long time for the food to finally arrive, the bacon on my sandwich was ice cold and they charged me for avocado yet one half had no avocado on it while the other had two small little chunks which, in my opinion is not worth being charged for. The fries didn't taste all that fresh either. The best thing about this meal was the milk shake as it was super good but that's not enough to really make this a good experience for me. I would have said something about my meal but the service was just too slow to risk sitting there even longer, so I decided not to make a fuss.

AGAING DURR ALEXA DURR Walking on in making the hostess feel weird when I instantly start taking pictures. Two grown women. One immediately says that she isn't hungry and the other, again, is taking pictures and checking her apps for updates and what-not. Despite all that, the hostess was kind and directed me to the bar (HEY NOW) when I told her that I was gonna order to go. Apparently, when you order to go, you'll be by the bar and you'll order your meal through the bartender.  Bartender was super nice. Gave me the menu. Obviously I was into getting a burger, but what kind of burger? Do I take the chili cheese burger? Do I go grab this Philly like cheese steak burger? Then my eye caught this Guac Bacon burger. Told myself that this was the healthy option among the burgers and ordered it. The bartender told me that it would take about fifteen minutes or so before my food was ready. That didn't happen. It take about seven minutes flat. He was surprised at how fast it came out, and I was surprised how fast it came out. As we walked out of the restaurant, I inwardly hoped that the food wasn't a mess and underdone because of how quick it came out of the kitchen. Guac Burger essentials: gauc, bacon, patty, swiss cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, onions, and mayo. Normally this wouldn't sound good to me. BUT I was hungry. So bite after bite I went through the burger. It's a big burger. The size was impressive. Even the amount of fries that they gave me was good. But the patty was a bit well done and I had asked for it to have more pink in it. There was hardly any guac in the burger too. I barely even tasted it. There was nothing in this item that amazed me. It was just another burger that I would eat because I was hungry. It wasn't something I would try again. The fries too had issues. Sure, there were a lot of fries.

Nydia S.,"Brentwood, CA",16,147,262,3.0,3/25/2016,"The place was literally jam packed as far as could be legal by fire codes standards. We arrived later than we would have liked (6:45 pm) but I wanted to see how it would be when it's actually truly busy. 25 minutes to be seated + 7 minutes for server to come to our table + 12-15 minutes for order to come = reasonable enough wait experience for time of day. The manager had called me the week prior to apologize for the issues we had with wait and poor quality. They took reasonable steps to encourage us to give it another try. Our server was Kim and she went out of her way to accommodate us. Both managers, Bill and Steve(?), even helped. I saw them moving around the restaurant floor helping different tables so I won't assume it was just us they were trying to please (though perhaps a little more intently due to my previous review).  What helped greatly was that we ordered our food to be brought out all at once and with the extra fries as well (as suggested by Bill). We also specified the condiments at that time. Not sure if it was the way we ordered, the server or the manager's knowledge of my previous review but things moved rather quickly. It may have been all of the above.  Overall it was a descent experience. My husband and I both ordered the whiskey river chicken and sandwich and our eldest son the burger version. I didn't much like the my sandwich but that's my own preferential issue. It was seasoned enough. Our eldest ""LOVED"" his mean and our other two enjoyed their pizza and grilled cheese sandwich bites. Husband said he liked the hamburger patties version of the whiskey river over the chicken sandwich version. That's all. Hope this helps someone in their own decision futuristically.

The restaurant was dirty- they had no bussers tonight according to several employees. It was apprentice. But it's always disgusting in here. Case and point; the front to go counter which is littered with dirty napkins. Corporate needs pay this place a visit && so does the county health inspector.

Clarence B.,"Danville, CA",52,209,136,3.0,3/26/2017,"Red Robin is Red Robin. They have bottomless fries, they got hamburger's and they got strawberry freckled lemonade.  They have tried to bring this restaurant into the 21st century and provide better service by installing these tablet like devices that you can order food from or summon your server or see what you are ordering before you get it, which is nice. They used to let you play the trivia games against other tables but now they charge you for that which sucks but hey that's capitalism.  They added sweet potato fries which is good for all you gluten free folks and lettuce wrap any burger which is great for low carb people.  I never really go out of my way to come to RR but when they send us a buy one get one 50% of coupon and I get a hankering for a burger I'll make my way down here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=20

Our order was simple; kids meatballs, BBQ burger and chicken tenders and fries, there is zero reason the tenders should be cold it's the easiest thing. He insisted on giving us a gift card to give them another chance.  So today I took my little one to lunch thinking it would be better. Everything came out quickly and correctly and our server was wonderful. However third bite in, I notice PUBE HAIR on my mushrooms. Probably beard hair either way. DONE!

Our waiter came and took down our orders which were the Black and Bleu burger garlic fries , the Marco Pollo burger with sweet potato fries, and the shorty o-ring.  While we wait for our order to came a small appetizer of Fries came which were delicious! We loved the seasoning on it and it was impossible to stop and take a picture. Then came the shorty o-ring which was just as equally delicious! We enjoyed the campfire sauce and the each sauces they came with. After devouring these items the final presentations came!  The black and Bleu burger with garlic fries was delicious! However the fries were too oily to consume in one sitting. The Marco Pollo burger was also amazing, it had a delicious chipotle sauce and the chicken was perfectly grilled. However the sweet potato fries were too salty, I did ask to get them remade and they didn't put salt on them. Which was kinda disappointing, I  just wanted less salt, if you see in the picture they had huge chucks of salt.

When our food came, the kids burgers were missing. when they finally came out my poor kids said they tasted like charcoal, upon examining the burger it looked like they were chewing on hockey pucks.

Justin B.,"Livermore, CA",1557,258,124,2.0,8/2/2016,"I have come to the conclusion that all Red Robins are the same. I have been to 3 different locations, each and every single one of them are the same. One is no longer open and who knows what will happen to the other two!  We had a new waitress who was training, but she had someone walking around with her. If he is the one that is doing the training and he is forgetting certain items as well, then she is going to be in trouble.  I had ordered broccoli instead of french fries. Order came with fries. Once delivered I had brought it to there attention and they acted like it was news to them. The trainer said he would get the broccoli for me. A few minutes later the new waitress said that the broccoli was coming. Needless to say, 30 minutes later the broccoli never showed up!  Another thing that irritates me is how long the tables stay dirty for. The same group of tables stayed dirty the whole time we were there, which was a little over an hour. If you are a server, you can make more money if you clean your own tables as well to get more people sitting there.  My last pet peeve with all RR's is: They have these new things on the table where you can order food and drinks. However you have to wait for the server to turn it on for you to do so. Every waiter or waitress will ask if you want any appetizers. Then they tell you to order them on the new table gadget. Whats the point of asking, if they are then going to tell you to do it on the table gadget but they have to turn it on for you.  Don't expect great service. Just expect a meal that might be what you actually ordered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=40

Sean F.,"Brentwood, CA",67,76,136,5.0,8/20/2016,"So I'm updating my review from 08/17/2016 as I said I would pending a response from their management. The Kitchen Manager Erick D. messaged me back today and  wanted me to contact him, to go over what our experience was the day of the review. After talking to him he invited us back to give them another shot. So here's what happened... When we arrived we asked to talk to Erick but I guess he was busy in the kitchen and the acting GM Matt came out to greet us. It was a Sat night and the place was busy. I wasn't too concerned about what our service was going to be like because we were invited to come back so I figured that they would take very good care of us. We arrived approx 6:10 PM and were sat by 6:14. The whole process took about about 45 mins from there, we were out the door and on our way by 7 pm. Matt checked on us several times and eventually Erick came by to introduce himself. All in all, it was a good experience the food came out prompt and our server Kadisha, Di Di for short (sorry if I butchered the spelling Kadisha) was very nice and attentive. We had very good service. The whole time I was looking around to see what everyone else's service was like. Here's what I noticed... Our server Kadisha was very attentive to ALL of her tables, she would do a quick scan and clear plates and get refills before people drinks got too low. Matt did check on us a few times but he was also checking on everyone else in our section. The Hostess staff were constantly walking in our area and setting up table or double checking them to make sure they could seat people promptly. The bus staff was on point clearing tables when patrons would leave. It didn't seem like anyone in our area was waiting around for their food to come out of the kitchen, so I could assume the kitchen staff was in there rocking it. All this would tell me that last Wednesday was just an off day. 4 Stars because I am a fan of Red Robin, the wife and I really do enjoy the food and their fun atmosphere. The 5th star for the effort the management put in to rectify our past experience. I realize that there will be bad days but thank you for caring enough to change at least one Yelper's dining experience. Much appreciated, we'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=40

Kim P.,"Oakley, CA",12,29,3,1.0,1/20/2016,"I have always liked Red Robin...the one in Concord. Every time we come to this one, (honestly, I don't know why we keep giving them chances) the service is slow, the food is cold or they mess up our order. This evening we came, we were seated immediately. The hostess wasn't the most friendliest either. She tried though, I guess.   There was probably a total of 5 groups (including us) in the dining area (not including the bar). So needless to say, they were slow. When the waitress came to take our drink order, we had enough time to look over the menu by that time so we just ordered our drinks, appetizer and meals all at the same time. While sipping on our drinks, we kept looking around cause time was passing and we still hadn't received our appetizer. After probably a good 45 min, our meal finally came out. That's right....no appetizer yet. Our meals looked thrown together. Our fries were cold and looked as if they were leftovers from someone else's plate (something of a common occurrence when coming here. Why do we keep coming??!! Smh). My husband ordered the egg burger, over easy but it came out over hard. It wasn't until our meals were almost done that the appetizer finally came. The gal that brought it felt bad and asked if we still wanted it. My husband didn't want to accept it but the gal said she would talk to the manager about getting it removed off our bill. We went ahead and took it. Then our waitress said she had spoken with the manager and they offered 50% off. Really?!  Lame. The tip calculator is wrong on the ziosk thing. It adds the tax in when it shouldn't (picture included). Since we weren't happy with this experience, my husband signed the check the way he really feels!! Yeah, picture included for this too!!  Typically we are more forgiving with some of these types of issues but when it's EVERY TIME, I think it's time to put this on the ""NEVER AGAIN"" list of restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=40

It didn't take long to get seated, but once seated everything seemed to take a while.  Our waiter didn't come to our table for quite a bit, he was very nice but nothing was explained to us. We didn't know we had to use the ""Ziosk"" to place  our appetizer order, refills, or even pay our bill. He said he only takes the main order .  We placed our appetizer order, but he still had to help us because neither of the two ziosks were working properly, very poor system. When our appetizers came they didn't give us plates and you couldn't get anyone to stop to ask for them. Besides, anytime we asked for anything it seemed as though they wouldn't come back for about 10-15 minutes. As for the appetizer, don't bother with the chips, guacamole and salsa. The serving of the guacamole is about 2 tablespoons. I had to laugh that one off. The onion rings and fried pickles were ok. We order our main dishes, peppercorn burger, southern charm burger, jalapeño burger, chicken tenders and shrimp, and chicken salad. It was okay. Definitely not the same quality of food from when we use to go to the Sunvalley Mall location years ago.

We haven't been there for about 2 years and we were really hungry. We placed our orders and got our onion rings first. The onion rings were really good. Not burnt. My wife ordered the fish and chips cause she gave up beef for lent and I got a bacon burger. We both had bottomless French fries but I paid a little extra so I can get the garlic one.  My wife bit into her fish and out came a long strand of hair. Not hers and we told the waiter about it. The manager over heard us and he came over asking her if she would like another order of fish or something else off the menu. She eventually ordered the 4 cheese melt. The waiter never came back to see how we were doing. Never refill our fries or refill my soda. The manager finally came to us and ask her if she liked what she ordered then he asked us if we wanted dessert. We said no..Good thing because when we got our bill, he took off the fish and chips but her 4 cheese melt was on the bill. Had we got the dessert, that would have been on that bill too. Isn't it a norm that if you found something foreign in your meal that you get the replacement for free? He told my wife that it's only $6 bucks. That's not the point.

They seem to have issues with their service, some days worse than others, but the managers are very quick to fix any problems you might be having. I may sound old when i say this but it's just too hard to find Millennials who care about the job their doing. We see this everywhere. The ""I don't give a shit"" attitude just bugs the F out of me, but what can you do?  Eat at home more i guess.  Anyway, i digress. Red robin, is a burger place, and as long as i remember that, i will not be dissatisfied.  Oh and by the way, if your going to have ""bottomless""  fries, then please don't give them to me 10 at a time and make me beg for them every 5 minutes, that's just rude, and borders on false advertising...just sayin'.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=60

Amanda C.,"Oakley, CA",3,139,1,2.0,3/27/2016,"Years ago when my kids were little I loved Red Robin for a casual meal.  Then they replaced all of their lights with LED's and they put in so many it was as bright as  an operating room, it would give me a headache, and so we stopped going.  2 weeks  ago my daughter asked if we could go to Red Robin for dinner and I agreed to give it another chance.    First, I was happy to see that the lights had been toned down.  The restaurant was clean (and basically empty which isn't surprising on a weekday) . The waitress greeted us almost 10 minutes after we were seated and we ordered our drinks and an appetizer. Except she wouldn't order our appetizer, she said we had to use a machine on the table that was covered in fingerprints to order it, I didn't even want to touch it, it was gross. The waitress was super out of it.  My daughter never got her soda.  The waitress kept forgetting we existed.  She mostly spent her time chatting with someone by the kitchen. By the time we got our food it was cold.  She would  walk by to check on one of her other tables and then go ""oh, oops!  I'll get you that soda"" etc... and then forget us again. Maybe she was stoned? The hilarious part was when she told me I had to use the dirty machine to pay the check and then she asked me to please give her a perfect  review after paying the check because it would really help her.  We still had not received the boxes we requested or my daughters soda! A week after the disaster above my daughter asked if we could pick up burgers to-go after our hike.  She called the order in and they told us it would be ready in 15 minutes.  I arrived on time and waited 45 minutes longer for our food.  The bartender was awesome and apologized profusely and she really felt bad about it, but management should have stepped in.   There were 3 other groups of people with me waiting for their food to come out and others arriving.

It was not at all edible AND the order wasn't even right. I really hate leaving bad reviews but that experience was ridiculous. Our server was surprised and just as disgusted as I was.

Emmalouise B.,"East Bay, CA",1380,1278,12486,2.0,3/6/2014,"I've been to this location a number of times now and am yet to be impressed. With the exception of mine and my Husband's first visit here which was ''ok'' (not great but not terrible) every other one has been so bad I actually emailed corporate. Let's break this down: - Inconsistent food - Half of the staff could not care less. - Pick and choose which discounts and Birthday deals they honor. - All meals never come out at once. - Always over cook the Burgers.  - Place is always untidy (dirty plates left on unoccupied tables for long periods of time) Each visit here we found the food to be on the decline until one day we came in and I was served bad (as in foul tasting) Chicken. My Chicken Ensenada Platter came out way before my Husbands with the server stating that my Husbands was ''just coming''. Great.. we don't mind waiting but I had no cutlery to eat my meal with which is fine if it was a Burger but I'm not an animal, eating Chicken Breast and Salad with my hands just wasn't going to happen. We sat trying to get the servers attention for 10 minutes before she came back over. My Husbands meal still not in sight and mine now gone fairly cold. His meal came 8 minutes later (yes, I timed it). As for the food that visit.. yuk! My Chicken was rubbery with a foul taste and my Husbands ''Medium'' Burger was way over cooked to the point of being chewy and dry. We left saying that would be our last visit. However, after emailing corporate about the issues I got a call from the manager of this location offering me a gift card to return ''on him'' with hopes to impress us next time. He did state that when we go in we should say that we're returning after a poor experience. Did I? Hell no.. That's almost as bad as going into a restaurant telling staff you Yelp. It would also defeat the whole point as they would be likely to go out of their way to try impress only then to go back to the same crappy experience we had before.  I was right not to say anything either because although the experience was marginally better the food and service was still pretty bad. I've been to quite a few Red Robin locations and this is the worst so far. I miss the San Mateo location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=80

Steph Q.,"Antioch, CA",23,31,96,3.0,5/4/2015,"Date: May 1, 2015  10 minute wait after being seated before our server came to take our order. Waited 28 minutes after our order was taken and when our food finally came out. (I noticed we weren't the only table looking grumpy at the long wait time for our meal. I saw at least 2 other tables questioning to themselves or their friends about where the server was and why the food was taking so long.)  Throughout the 28 minute wait (yes, I timed it), our server never once came over to tell us something along the lines of ""I'll check on your food"", ""I'm not sure what's taking so long, let me look"". Instead, a manager noticed our slightly unhappy demeanor as we were very hungry and came over to ask if maybe there was something wrong with the food. He was very considerate and immediately went to find out what happened to our meal. After asking our server, he came back to inform us that another server accidentally gave my dad's burger to another customer and we were waiting for another one to be made. As much as I appreciate the manager taking the time to let us know of the situation, I feel like it's part of the server's job to let us know. Unfortunately, I didn't happen to get the manager's name, but I really appreciated his concern and helpfulness!  I ordered the Buzz Clucks & Mac 'N' Cheese. I found the buzz clucks to be too intense in flavor. I couldn't taste the chicken. All I could taste was the overwhelming BBQ breading that surrounded the chicken. I was so grateful for the ranch sauce so I could smother it in ranch. It wasn't spicy, there was just too much breading that drew me away for the chicken. Originally I was assuming that it was being served as chicken tenders with either a BBQ dip on the side or had the sauce on it instead of a full-blown breading attack to the palette... On the other hand, I enjoyed the Mac 'N' Cheese that came with it. Super hot, temperature-wise, but delicious. I wouldn't order this again as much as I love Mac 'N' Cheese.  My dad ordered the Red's Big Tavern Burger with a Diet Coke. The burger was fine, seemed smaller than usual even though he ordered the larger portion. Typically, servers would ask if he would like a refill on his soda, but she never came to ask. He was disappointed in that as he tends to finish his drink quickly. (Yes, I know he could've asked, but seeing as we were both famished for not eating breakfast so we could watch The Avengers: Age of Ultron, we weren't exactly in an asking mood.)  Overall, food was just average. Not too thrilled about our server; she was nice but she also happened to disappear a lot when you needed her for something...

Now they're flavorful with a fair selection of burgers. I ordered the bacon bacon burger with bacon aioli. Really good and bacony!  The only thing I found to be a joke was that the waitress asked is how we wanted our burgers cooked. As expected, they came out overcooked but still edible.

First off the service was mediocre at best , the staff is more like high school graduates having a good time.  The food was just throwin together with no pride on how it looked or tasted. ""We we're not the only ones having issues with our food"" , from the time we sat down there was people complaining about the same issues . We we're thinking they were picky people and we shouldn't have the same issues . I ordered the A-1 peppercorn burger with the works and got a bun,2pieces of red onion, a burnt patty with cold melted cheese , 1 slice smashed tomatoe , and a silver dollar size splash of A-1 sauce topped off with the bun . Wife's chicken sandwich was a fried patty sitting on top of pickles, shredded tomatoes,  and a pile of lettuce.  Not much quality control here if they keep this up I can't see the being open very much longer.

Chelsea R.,"Pacifica, CA",394,31,1,2.0,3/30/2015,"Sad to say.. had a bad experience.. Went to this Red Robins location on Saturday night. I didn't get there until about 9:30p.m. or so. It was not busy at all.  Ordered some sodas and apps, then our main meals. Apps came out fast and were delicious as usual.  Food came. I wasn't too hungry so I just had some of my boyfriend's bottomless sweet potato fries. When we asked for the second batch they were ICE cold. Seemed like they were cooked and then placed in the fridge. I was super tired anyways, so I decided to have ""one last fry"" a call it a meal.. well that last fry was a huge mistake.. I almost CHOKED on the longest piece of hair. Ew. I was SO disgusted.  I get it, I used to wait tables, HAIR HAPPENS. It may not even be your hair.. and you have no control over it. What I didn't like is that when I kindly let the server know, she decided to speak to me like a baby and say ""oh no, do you want me to get you some to-go"" I felt mocked, and that it was VERY rude..  Because of how tired I was and with a long drive ahead of me, I said no thank you and the check would be fine.. I was in no mood to argue.  Sure enough, got the check, and nothing has been taken off or discounted. I thought that was really poor on the servers end.... If I were her, I  would of walked straight to management, let them know of the situation, and see what we could of done for the customers. I am not asking for a free meal, and while I understand they are bottomless fries, I was inconvenienced as a customer.  That's okay though, I discounted it myself by leaving her 15% instead of 20% tip.. If only she would of gone that extra step to make the customer feel valued, taken care of, and appreciated- she would of gotten 25-30% tip.  I was sick to my stomach the rest of the night.

Possibly the same sort of lesson Rihanna learned after Chris brown whooped her a**.  People don't often really change. I can not tell you how many chances I have given this Red Robin location . Every single burger i have ordered here in the past few months has been luke-warm, as well as their ""bottomless"" fries. Sorry Red Rocket, but as long as you keep pumping out those mediocre frozen french fries, there's no need for that lack of a bottom. Oh and don't even get me started on the fact that they started charging for the dipping sauces they offer for the fries there....the one god damn thing that kept bringing  me back is now up-charged. What a crock. What, are they going to start for ketchup next week? Anyways, I go there for lunch today and order the crispy chicken sandwich thinking I'd switch it up and maybe they wouldn't suck so much at their jobs for once. WRONG.  it wasn't that the food tasted necessarily bad right then and there...it was what came after..... Thank god I live 3 minutes up the road off Minnesota because holy SH*t .....literally. I have been in and out of my bathroom since I got home this afternoon. And when I'm not sitting on the toilet I'm sitting on an ice cube. Not sure what exactly went wrong but i can't say it would be the first time the brothers from down south of the border that Red Robin keeps in back failed to cook my food properly.

First we waited for 20+ minutes to be seated although there were open tables. When we got seated it was obvious why there's a wait; the middle section was served by only one server.  It took 10 minutes to ask us what drinks we wanted, then an additional 30+ minutes for the food.  Apparently they have two separate kitchens in terms of dividing the items like salad and burgers. While our burgers were ready, getting cold, they had to still make the salad. The men's bathroom was disgusting, the urinal didn't flush so I used the stall (which I recommend you using the furthest from the door because it has more room). The food was fair; the fries were sometimes cold and fresh. The server (Maddy) was nice though, she brought us fries while we were waiting, checked up on us frequently and always had a smile.

Black, dry and tastless. My wifes burger had two small pieces of bratwurst which were also burnt and dry. Her sweet potato fries were cold. Not ""taken from the fryer and left on the counter"" kind of cold. But literally still cold in the center from the freezer. Our waitress never came by to see if we needed anything. It wasnt until we summoned her from the little electronic gadget on the table that she came. ""More fries?"" No thanks, still defrosting the ones you brought us earlier.  We decided to push our luck with dessert. Had to order from the little electronic gadget again. Went for the cheesecake. When the waitress brought it to us, we requested more napkins.

She had three tables to wait on and somehow couldn't manage any of them. She would attend to one and ignore the others, never bothering to ask if the other tables needed anything as she walked past. Twice we requested another set of silverware and extra napkins.  Overall it was just not up to our expectations, and as a regular diner at Red Robin our expectations are not very high. We go there because the kids like it but we won't be going back. I do not recommend anyone else going there either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=140

Once we ordered waitress brought us a order of their famous fries to enjoy while we waited. I had the DGB burger, A+. Cooked as i requested, my wife had a bacon cheeseburger also made how she likes it. Waitress continued to check on us, even bringing additional orders of fries & ranch which we didn't have to ask for. All in all a great experience.

Susan C.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,17,,4.0,2/15/2015,"I went here with my friend that I was visiting in Brentwood. I ordered the peppercorn burger and it was delicious, although I could not detect the pepper flavor. The only thing that I thought was sub par was the bacon that came on it was half cooked and greasy. Fortunately, our waitress was on the ball and checked right back with us after our food was delivered. She brought me new bacon that was cooked more and somewhat less greasy, but I put it in a napkin to absorb the rest of the grease. Then I just took all the bacon including the original two strips and took it home for breakfast the next morning.  I did go in to the ladies restroom to wash my hands before eating and I found it to be clean and stocked up with the appropriate paper products. Oh, and since I signed up on their website, my burger was free during my birthday month! Thanks, Red Robin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=140

Our server was a male, and he came about 15 minutes after we were seated; therefore, we were already ready to order our food. He separated our orders into 3 tabs because we were paying separately. We were never given any silverware the entire time we had our food; luckily, we ordered food that didn't needed any silverware (except a friend of mine had coleslaw with her entreé). By the time he came back to ask how everything was going (which was about 20 minutes later), it was too late to ask for silverware since we were halfway done with our food. I felt like he was rushing us because he gave our checks way too early. He also messed up on one of our checks; my drinks were added to one of my friends tab. The service could've been better but at least the food was great.

Marie O.,"Brentwood, CA",2,143,21,1.0,7/26/2016,This was our first visit to Red Robin. We wanted to have a good burger so thought we would give it a try since we had just been to the Movies. There were only a few people in the restaurant so even though some people will use that as a reason for bad service...it shouldn't be....but that wasn't the case anyway. The service was bad. I don't have names but the Greeter at the front door with long brown hair was genuinely friendly and nice. But the young girl with blonde hair that was our server was fake friendly and definitely needs better training. We have never been to Red Robin...so when it came time to order she made us feel dumb that we didn't know to order our drinks ourselves with the table kiosk. Upon taking our order my husband ordered a Regular Cheeseburger with the Chili and I had the Burnin Love with No Cheese and Garlic Fries.  So we got our food...They brought my husbands chili first. It was only flavorful because of the onions tossed on top other than that...so bland. When they brought our burgers I received regular fries not garlic. My husbands burger came with fries as well...but Why? He had substituted chili for the fries. Well we know why...the server wasn't paying attention..ordered the chili as an addition..so instead of $1.79 chili we were charged 3.59...plus we were charged for garlic fries we did not receive. This girl was clueless. And she did one of my pet peeves when it comes to female servers. She just assumed my husband was paying as she kept directing all her attention to him. Believe me ..we are old enough to be her grandparents so I know it wasn't flirtatious...but I do think she was looking for a good tip..Surprise surprise...I paid the check.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=160

I complained to the manager and to corporate whose only response was a $10 gift certificate. What good is that if you can't get waited on   Both time were between 5:30 and 6 pm on a Friday and the restaurant was not that busy.  They need to adjust staffing and training of Staff starting with the manager. If you can get served the food is usually good but the fries are always cold because they leave the orders sitting until the entire tables orders are ready - hint put the fries on the plate only when you are ready to deliver the food.  I always have to order more as soon as I get my plate so I get some that are warm.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=160

Sat at bar, service was OK. Bartender chatted with a friend the whole time, and also gossiped loudly with every co-worker who came by. Burger was good, but not worth $13. Fries portion was tiny and free refill took a long time. Next time was with family, four of us came. Restaurant was half-empty, but there was over a dozen people waiting for a table. Apparently the kitchen could not keep up so they stopped seating people. Saw three dissatisfied customers talk to a snarky manager before we left. Went back again a few weeks later, this time got seated. But waiter was awful, everything seemed to be in a rush. I can only assume he was getting off his shift. Gave us our food and then disappeared until we were done, no drink refills or fry refills before the next time we saw him, in which he gave us the bill. Entire restaurant is very poorly managed.

Wendy K.,"Brentwood, CA",1,4,,1.0,9/20/2015,"Red Robin Brentwood has had their ups and downs since opening, and they are in the down cycle  now.  They changed the decor and separated the place into three 'rooms' and fancied up the decorations so it looks nice when you go in. And that's where the up cycle ends.  They are now using some new automation card reader and menu /order tablet on the tables, but no one told us about them or how to use them.  Surprise!  if you use the thing to play games, while waiting forever to see your food to show up, you pay $1.99 Entertainment Fee.   They seem to be under staffed, and the management team doesn't really care about customer experience. Perhaps that's a feature of transitioning to the new table top tablets, because although there was a nice waitress to take our order and bring us our food, the kitchen must have only one cook, it took 45+ minutes to get our food; and there must be only one bus kid, because there were  dirty tables in a half empty room for the whole time we sat there - well over an hour.   The endless fries never did show up.

My friend who sat with me had her drink refilled many times but for some reason the server never even bothered to fill mine up. There was also a hair in my cheese when I requested it to be on the side. This was my 2nd experience.  Then on my last and most recent experience. Not only was the service slow but my food was gross and dry! The server was kind and I did appreciate that however it took a while for him to bring our drinks. When the food finally came I was missing a topping. I only requested 2 toppings on my burger and they forgot the tomatoes! Not only that but the buns on my burger tasted and felt as if they had been out in the air and hardened and dried out and on top of it they ""toasted"" the buns as if to try to hide that they were hard and they burnt them. Absolutely horrible. I couldn't even finish my food! The fries are normally good but this time around they tasted as if they were not fresh and just reheated or just undercooked.

We were here again today and I think this will be our last time here.  Let's start at the beginning of our visit..... we came in and i told the girl upfront that it was 4 adults and one highchair, not a booster seat, a highchair! Well when we were going to be seated they brought us over to a booth and she had a booster seat with her... she then asked me if the booth would work for us, i told her ""yes if my niece can reach in a highchair not a booster"" she then looked over and there was an empty table in the middle of the dining room, where we were smooshed in like sardines (we ended up lowering 2 of the leafs on the table so the people around us had some wiggle room and the table was dirty). We sat patiently and our server came.. of course it started out smoothly.. ordered our drinks and appetizers and to my surprise they came out in a timely manner.  Now mind you we are still smooshed like sardines, we see that a big party had left and asked if we could be moved to that table since we were a little tight at our table and our server said yes that she wouldn't mind and she would get someone to clean the table... we waited and waited and waited... our food came and we asked about the table again and the servers response was ""I asked someone to clean it, but I don't know what happened but here is your food""... I think I had a WTF look on my face at this point. So of course the usual question "" is there anything i can bring you?"" Ummmmm how did she not see all of our empty cups?? We asked for refills and I asked her for ranch for our fries... also by the time she came back with only 1 side of ranch for 4 people we figured out my brothers burger had nothing but meat cheese and bacon, no lettuce, no tomato.. we asked her for a side of it to which she looked at us like we asked her for something foreign.  Ugh, i was irritated at this point that i just wanted to leave but we ate.... at the end we were never asked if we needed a to go box... we only got an attitude when we asked for the bill and she told us if we weren't paying with cash we could just pay on the machine.

April L.,"Oakley, CA",84,28,9,3.0,7/12/2015,"For starters let me say that Red Robin is normally one of my family's favorite places to get burgers yet today's experience left something to be desired.  The restaurant was not busy when we arrived yet we were sat at a dirty table that was barely bussed.  It still had 2 dirty booster seats at the table, one of which was laying under the table on its side. Furthermore, whoever was working in the kitchen and made my food completely messed up my order.  I ordered the fiery ghost tavern style tavern double, which is my favorite,  but the only thing that was on my burger when it arrived was the fresh jalapeños.  The fried jalapeños, tomato, and lettuce were missing from my burger. I had to ask our waiter about the missing items. He went to the kitchen and came back with the fried jalapeños.  Also there were less then 8 of the steak fries in the basket with my burger. Needless to say I was not amused with my favorite burger being below the normal level I am used to.  On a positive note, our waiter Jonny was beyond amazing.

One dish came out wrong, and was sent back. She brought back the dish, with a half ass ""I know you said no mayonaise, but there was only a little bit of mayonaise that was on there. They still took it back and made you a new one"". Who says that? It was a pretty lengthy wait time (about 1 hr) for all the food to come out on a Monday night.

Immediately upon entering the restaurant I was greeted with the substandard customer service experience I have become used to at this location.  When I asked for a booth instead of a table the hostess stated that it was not possible to place a high chair at the end of the booth because it was a fire hazard. Even after explaining it was done there many times in the past, she not only refused to do it but was extremely rude about it. How this is a fire safety hazard when it does not reduce the wide walk way much at all is beyond me, however being polite I'm certain is not a safety hazard. Nor is refraining from walking by the table glaring at us.  The food was overall good with a few exceptions: 1) One meal not made as ordered. 2) Sweet potato fries delivered cold to adult customer even after having to wait extended time after other food for them to be available; yet were given to children so hot they had to let them cool a little before eating them.

A lot of the ill-reviews here seem to be from out-of-ordinary experiences, as I know that management is always on site in case of issues. I suggest coming here on weeknights, because the weekends get packed and crazy! As for the establishment itself, it's like every other Red Robin! Great food, affordable price, and a great family atmosphere. The decorations are cool to look around at, and their menu is dynamic and breathing and changes every few months. I highly suggest getting bottomless freckled lemonade! And fries are bottomless too, so make sure to order those with whatever you decide on. The Royal Red Robin Burger offers a fried egg on it.. and it's delicious! If you're into sports, they always have big games on! And they have a full bar.

Shannon H.,"Brentwood, CA",749,1031,606,2.0,2/27/2011,"I have not been to one of these joints in years. I pretty much have most of my memories as a kid at these places, indulging in the mile high mud pie along with mediocre burgers and fries (which to me at the tender age) probably tasted amazing......Times have changed and so have my taste buds. My friend and I had a craving for a burger and being this was close by and I had not been to them in years, I decided to give them a shot. The place is your typical chain diner style restaurant, appearing slightly unkept this time. I ordered the patty melt with onion rings on the side and my friend ordered the turkey burger. Our waitress was extremely upbeat and friendly and incredibly helpful so that was an absolute plus. My burger was a slight disapointment.Taste wise it was ok, portion size of the patty was weak, small and just a few steps down from what a diner style burger should be. Onions ring were typical decent.

This particular venue had fantastic service, as well. Our server was amazingly attentive. She offered us fries while we waited, because she knew we were famished. Food arrived fairly quickly and cooked perfectly.  She made sure we had all the condiments we asked for and gave us lots of extra napkins, too!   They get 5 stars, because the overall experience was what I expected:  clean establishment, prompt greeting at the entrance, friendly service with a smile, and delicious food that was decently priced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=240

However!  They will stay in touch via email keeping you up on what they've been up to and what all cool is happening in their Robin nest, whether you really want to hear about it or not....Reminds me why I don't have a Facebook acct -  ""Not that there's anything wrong with that.""   Banzai burger the menu describes as ""Marinated in teriyaki & topped with grilled pineapple, Cheddar cheese, crisp lettuce, tomatoes and mayo.""   Price $9.29.  Good stuff.    Bruschetta chicken sandwich which the menu describes as ""grilled chicken breast with freshly prepared bruschetta salsa, pesto aioli, Provolone cheese, romaine lettuce and balsamic cream on rustic ciabatta bread.""  Bread is soft and fresh, chicken grilled right and flavors combined well.  Price $10.49.  *Note to self:  Remember the ingredients and make this at home!  I can't help but chuckle because ""The Robin"" kinda reminds me of Applebees, which has been taking some flack in some recent comedies like Couples Retreat and Hall Pass about a stereotypical chain restaurant filled with families and kids where thirty something guys go to hangout in the bar for a cool night out.  But I ain't that guy I tell ya!  I do like their burgers.

Orders placed, I mentioned to keep the fries coming (love those unlimited fries!) and she said that my statement made her nervous (oh boy, what did I get myself into?). I fully expected a basket of fries to come no more than five minutes later because that's what I've experienced in the past but no, we waited 20 mins only because our waitress saw that we didn't have our food yet and tried to make us happy (psst...the basket of fries arrived via some other waiter and he threw it on our table!)

Danielle P.,"Discovery Bay, CA",1,35,,2.0,8/19/2013,"We've tried it three times, and I'm in no hurry to go back. On trips I've been to a couple Red Robins in other areas and to be truthful I'm not a huge fan.  I do not enjoy burgers so overstuffed that food is falling everywhere, so even though I think some of their flavor combos are fun and their fries are pretty tasty, I rarely choose to eat here.  Still, when one moved into Brentwood I was happy to have another option close to the shopping center and movie theature. The first time we went service was pretty slow, but the restaurant was almost brand new so we gave it a pass.  I don't remember exactly what we ordered, but the food was fine. Second time I made the mistake of ordering a fish sandwich.  Once I got it the sandwich was very tasty...once I got it.  We watched other tables sit, give their order, get their food, and leave before I got my sandwich!  I would have been happy to reorder something else if the fish sandwich was so terribly difficult to make, but was never given the opportunity.  We just keep being told ""It's on its way out.""  I know it was my sandwich too because while my sandwich was good, my husband and daughter's burgers had that soggy bun ""under the lamps too long"" yuk going on. Third visit, just my husband and I, and we decide to split the onion rings appetizer.  They tasted...okay...but later that night we were both sick as dogs. For whatever reason this parking lot is always full to overflowing, so someone must be happy here, but it sure isn't me.  I hope that as they keep adding more restaurants to the area this place will either step up its game to compete or will go out of business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=260

But last night, I finally got the umph I needed to write this review. First off, let me say I was with my husband and two children, 6 and 8. We got there at 7 and we were seated immediately but warned of a wait. We were fine with it though, had just come from a movie, had popcorn! I headed to use restroom, disgusting. Overflowing trash, no toilet paper and I could see in the stall through the toilet paper holder (luckily my daughter). Immediately our easter told us because of the wait we could have dessert for free.....I thought that was weird since we had just sat down. Anyways, ordered food. It took 1 hour for it to come. 4 burgers....so...clearly not that hard. I looked at the kitchen, cooks were eating french fries and drinking while cooking. Also, one was rubbing eyes and face and then placed food on plate with bare hands. The waiter was holding a plate to the lamp to reheat before serving....it was quite a sight. Finally our meals came, which I was already turned off. I got my burger, cut in half, it was bloody. I ordered ""well well done"". I sent it back, refused to pay for it. Decided to skip eating. After waiting another 30 minutes for receipt we were told we could check out on kiosk. It is the LAST time I will give red Robin my business.....especially since they are charging $14 foe a burger.

Now i understand that there was 15 of us and its not easy to find a table for everyone together but that particular day was not at all busy and there was a long stretch of tables that were cleaned an ALL empty right at the time we arrived. However it took the hostess 1 1/2 hours to give us the tables even when no one sat there the entire time we waited. After that we finally got to order and surprisingly the food came pretty quickly, but after we got the food there was a reason it had come so quickly. Three peoples chicken burgers were frozen! The fries we received were cold and hard, and one of us never received the food that they put on his bill. We sent the frozen burgers back after taking to a particularly rude waitress and asked for a refund since we had not gotten what we order and had underdone fries and chicken. The manager was particularly rude and never gave us compensation for the food, however they did bring back fully cooked burgers and fries for those who had received frozen ones.

Jacqueline S.,"Tucson, AZ",13,84,11,1.0,2/17/2014,"After living in Tucson for 12 years, you start to like some chain restaurants and Red Robin was one I was always a big fan of. My mom and I would make the 40 minute drive, sometimes solely to go and eat there. So I was incredibly disappointed after my experience there tonight. We walked in around 8:50 and there was still quite a few diners there however there was no seating hostess to be found. An older lady from the bar approached my boyfriend and I, and I asked if we could be seated at a half booth. She then asked if I wanted just a booth, and I repeated that I'd like a half booth half table. At that point the actual hostess appeared and I repeated my request. She led us first to the left side of the restaurant where there wasn't an actual table where we could be seated. She took us back to the front of the restaurant and told us to hold on so she could clear off a different table on the other side of the dining room. She seated us and was very nice so I thought, 'okay this isn't so bad.'  We were seated relatively close to the kitchen so we were able to hear some chit chat from that area, which was fine until one of the waitresses started swearing profusely about having to split a check. She was clearly very upset (understandable as waiting isn't an easy job) but there is a time and place to vent such frustrations and as a customer I shouldn't be able to hear it. Throughout our time there she sat at a table behind us with three other waitresses (they were supposedly rolling silverware) and she was being loud and complaining the whole time. At one point a manager approached and told them that they needed to get up, to which she responded with something like 'It's been a really long night, I shouldn't even be rolling silverware.' I just couldn't believe she was behaving in such a way. The customer service industry isn't easy, but it's a job and if you don't like it then you should probably find another one.  The entire time we were there, all the tables around us that had had diners remained covered in plates and dirty napkins. It wasn't until I was walking out the door that a single buser came to clean off the table tops. No one else considered it worthwhile. I've never seen tables at a restaurant stay dirty for anywhere near that amount of time.  Our waitress came and took our drink orders and then came back for our diner orders. However, once our food came out, my basket was full to the brim and my boyfriend's looked sad and empty. He had 8 fries, whereas I had at least 20. Our waitress never spoke directly to my boyfriend, never refilled his drink or asked about his food. I had to ask her to refill his drink and to bring us more fries. He felt pretty badly about the lack of consideration and acknowledgment he received and actually left the restaurant to wait in the car. I went to speak with the manager who at first wasn't very approachable. She said she would check on our order of fries and come back out. I went back to our table (the fries had already come out) and waited for her. I couldn't see her in the kitchen, so I decided to leave. On the way out I approached the same older lady who had come to seat us earlier so that she could let the manager know that we got our fries and I had left. She basically dismissed me with a look and so I left. I will NEVER return to this Red Robin again. I am absolutely appalled by the way they treat their customers. Luckily I live in an area where unless it is late (which is why we went to Red Robin in the first place) there are many delicious food options. This experience really left a bad taste in my mouth for not only Red Robin but for chain restaurants as a whole. If being a chain means that employees think that they can put in less work then I don't care to spend my money there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=260

Matthew J.,"Vernon, CA",0,13,1,1.0,12/31/2014,"This place is probably the most horribly managed restaurant in the east bay. So a waitress comes by to fill our drinks and she pours water all over the table, creating a gigantic mess of water across both myself and the table, as well as a huge puddle on the ground where the water is falling onto. Normally I wouldn't be bothered too much by this, as mistakes happen. But the waitress looks at it, says nothing and walks away. No apologies, no ""I'll be right back,"" nothing. So I assume she's on her way to clean up the mess, except 10 minutes goes by and she never comes to clean it up. Obviously irate by this, I called the manager over. The manager did not offer an apology or any form of compensation, offering the excuse that the waitress was new and had not yet been properly trained to clean it up when she makes a mess. Are you kidding me? I left a $0.00 tip, deservedly so. I've never seen such incompetent management at any restaurant.

This was the first time I stopped at this Brentwood location. It was a Sunday afternoon and the place was busy. I opted to sit at the bar and order food. I ordered the Pig Out Tavern burger and a beer. It did seem like it was a little slow in getting my order. But the burger was good and so were the fries. Personally, I prefer skinny fries, but these are OK. My only real complaint was that there was a cold draft where I was sitting. I ended up putting my jacket on to eat. The front door was closed so I don't know where the draft was coming from. I do think their prices are a little high. If I'm in the area again, I will probably try somewhere else to eat before coming here again. That doesn't mean this place is no good...I just think I can get more bang for my buck elsewhere.

Jessica M.,"Brentwood, CA",34,17,,2.0,11/3/2012,"My husband and I recently went here for lunch and although the service was not great I chose to go back today because I was craving their BLTA croissant and fries. I took my 5-year old daughter with me and we were seated right away. Our uninterested waitress came to take our drink and food order, and after I received my water (without the lemon I requested) our waitress never returned to check on us. It took 30 minutes for me to receive my lunch order (my daughter didn't want anything so it was just the one plate) and I literally watched as my sandwich sat on the food line for at least 12 minutes. My sandwich was soggy and the fries were cold and tasted a day old. I received one water refill from another waitress passing by and yet another waitress eventually brought my food over. Each time I saw my waitress pass, she never made eye contact so I couldn't wave her over. Finally, as I'm halfway through the sandwich I'm forcing myself to eat, our waitress comes over to see if we need anything, so I ask for the campfire sauce I originally requested with my order but did not receive. It took a few minutes, but she eventually brought it. Overall, we were there for an hour for one lousy meal. Luckily, my daughter was very patient. In addition to MY poor experience: As I was watching the food line I saw another waitress poking her finger into a cheeseburger that I assume she was about to serve to another patron.

Sarah M.,"Manteca, CA",218,263,420,2.0,10/15/2012,"Met an old friend for lunch today because Brentwood was a good halfway point for us. I had only eaten at Red Robin like once before and it was a while ago so I did not really remember the menu. I have to say I was not impressed both by their selection or by the taste of the food. I think that is the reason I have not gone back. My memory was refreshed.  After staring at the menu for what seemed like forever I finally made a selection. They pretty much have burgers, sandwich, and salads none of which sounded that great. I finally settled on the Guacamole Bacon Burger and chose Mac and Cheese for the side instead of the fries. I enjoy eating and when I have to settle on something at a restaurant that is usually not a good sign. I can usually find something I actually want to try. Well the burger was a huge disappointment. The bacon just looked gross and tasted just as gross so I took it off. The guacamole was devoid of any flavor and so was the meat. So basically what I had was an overpriced flavorless burger. I asked for a side of pickles and they made the burger tolerable and I ate about half of it. The Mac and Cheese, however, was really good. I am glad I ordered that as a side. I ate all of that. The customer service was ok for the most part. Nothing outstanding or memorable. When I wanted a Dr. Pepper I had to flag someone down because our waiter was nowhere to be found. Would I go back? Probably not. I do not mean just this specific location but Red Robin in general. I just don't like their food selection. Nothing seemed that good to me. We have one in my hometown of Manteca so I do have access if I wanted to go.  I prefer small hole in the wall places to big chain restaurants to start off with and if I do go to chain restaurant I can think of quite a few that I know I like alot better than this place. If I ever go back to a Red Robin again it will be at someone else's choosing; like for their birthday or something.

RR had it neatly set up and reserved. Great. The downside is that the host/seater was rude to several members of the party who arrived a bit before the majority of the group. Her point was that the whole group had to be there to be sat. No problem if you are taking up regular space while people are waiting but in this case the Set up reserved table was sitting empty and the people in our party had arrived taking up lobby space. Why not filter where they need to go so as to ease up the lobby? Win-win. I guess not sadly.  Next we start to order but our server doesn't want to do separate checks saying that it will be trouble for us with the kitchen. Unfortunately, we must as in a group of 30 plus, some only have credit cards and we didn't want the server to have to figure individual items out later. We should have listened if we could have because the server was right. The food came out at different times so people eating together didn't get their food at even near he same time.  The second mini group to order was the last to be served. Waiting made loads of other food cold. Apparently one side of the kitchen can get food out fast, the other not so much and since there were tickets from our party in both kitchens, disaster.  They should look into why that is? The burgers here are divine and the fries are good when served hot. The beer is cold, the water flows and the new specialty beverages are delish. Sports are on the tvs and the atmosphere is like a loud backyard party.  The server was courteous and refilled the drinks, refilled  fries, etc in a timely way. The food was fresh and enjoyable.

Minus 1 star for being abnormally noisy. The restaurant is set up in an open seating, no dividers between people for privacy. Therefore, the ambient noise gets louder and louder until your head hurts! Like literally. I went home with a headache the noise was so bad. Minus 1 star for inattentive waiters.

There was immediately a mix up regarding drinks that our waitress tried to say was my error and I very clearly repeated word for word how the exchange went - she finally replied ""oh, that's right"" and corrected my drink order and canceled the request for a manager to come over and red tag it.  WTF? Another guy came around and provided tables with complimentary baskets of steak fries - that was cool. We ordered our burgers, my kids had cheeseburgers I had the chicken on foccacia with pesto - yum.   I can appreciate our waitress when I asked her how the chicken sandwich is and she spun around to show me the embroidered word ""honesty"" on her sleeve - apparently, its one of RR's core values so when our waitress replied ""i don't like it"" , I knew I had to order it! Our food was very good - big fresh warm portions all served with a smile - for the most part.   During opening week they were donating .50 cents to Childrens Hospital for every burger ordered - I thought that was cool and that is why I added the fourth star. Like most chain restaurants their drinks aren't ever much to write home about and that standard applies here too - I hope they add ""light pours"" to their sleeves. I'd definitely go back but I won't go out of my way to do it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=320
K. I.,"Concord, CA",13,64,,3.0,10/5/2009,"Pleasantly surprised... but we won't push our luck. I have to admit, one of the reasons we ate here was because were intrigued. Seeing a Red Robin that wasn't protruding out of the side of a mall was a new sight for us, so why not give it a shot? Plus, we figured that it would be as good a place as any. As someone who doesn't frequent this area, I found myself overwhelmed with the simple task of grabbing a bite to eat with my pregnant wife and mom-in-law before we resumed baby shopping. Retail porn - that's the only way I can describe this area. Home Depot on one side, Lowe's on the other. Target here, Wal-Mart just down the street. A little overkill, don't you think? But I digress.... Wait staff - decent. attentive enough. Drinks - foofy iced teas and lemonades abound. good enough. Food - Now maybe we were just hungry, but I have to say that the food was pretty good! Wifey and I had chicken ""burgers,"" and she had a side of garlic fries. Mom-in-law had a burger. No complaints from any of us.  I'm sure that if we chose to visit this location more often, it would become more and more obvious that this is a typical chain restaurant - as most places do.

The restaurant must have desert.  Its a sit down restaurant for cryin out loud. Our waitress finally noticed us fifteen minutes later and asked us what we wanted.  I asked her about deserts.  She gave us the little booklet that they give you the check in.  Hmm... That strikes me as odd.  We asked for water while we waited.  Another ten or so minutes pass and she finally brings us our water (thank God it was clean water and not dirty tasting tap water).  We order some ice cream cake thing (only one of the three choices for desert).  The desert was ok at best.  Not at all worth the $6.00 it was.  The service after we got noticed was horrid.  When your glass is completly empty (beverage AND ice), it is nice to be noticed for a refill right???  WRONG!!! I HAD TO ASK FOR REFILLS FOR MY GIRLFRIEND AND MYSELF FOR FRIGGEN WATER!!!!!  Out waitress walked past us at least fifteen times over the course of our stay at this God forsaken restaurant and I had to get her friggen attention.   Needless to say, I have had better service at Burger King then this particular Red Robin.  Stay Away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=320

Last night: After at least 20 minutes of waiting for our food we ordered. Our waitress tells us that she forgot to send in the food to the kitchen. Then after all that, she goes on a break without telling us and we don't see her for another 15 minutes. Then we asked if we can get boxes for our food, it took another 10 minutes just to get that. I work at a restaurant so I'm generally very patient with the staff, but this was ridiculous since she wasn't that busy. She had enough time to talk to the table next to us for a good 8 minutes (about job employment somewhere else), but can't take 20 seconds to walk and get our boxes after we asked.

Then asks about the sizes and how much each were. The waitress responds with a roll of the eyes and says. ""Ummm like six bucks or something"". Sorry?? Is it our fault that you didn't study the menu and prices. I was immediately turned off. She plopped the basket of fried on our table. I am NOT EVEN KIDDING.. we had 5 fries in there. It was stupid. When we got our food it was the same thing, like 5 fries in the basket and I got the California Chicken Burger with bacon and avo. AWFUL. I couldn't taste the avo OR the bacon. I had to open it up to see if it was even in there. They spread a thin layer of guacamole on one side of the bun and put 1 slice of floppy bacon. FLOPPY!! How hard is it to make bacon. I was pissed.

Aja A.,"Discovery Bay, CA",10,11,,3.0,7/8/2009,"In general Red Robin has been very good to us. But not the new Brentwood location.  The layout of the restaurant is totally weird. As others have said, there are absolutely no dividers so the volume is very loud. I actually had to lean into my family members and talk loud so they could hear me.  The waiters messed up orders on three occasions:  1.) A drink was brought to us that wasn't ours.  2.) My son's dinner was brought to another table, and according to Red Robin, as soon as it's put down on the wrong table, they can't give it to the right table and has to be recooked. So my son had to wait double the time to get his food.  3.) Entrees were brought to our table that weren't ours.  Because of the second ordeal the kids got free deserts and my son's meal was free.  We spent way more time there than we would have because it took forever for my son to get his meal.  I cut them some slack because they just opened and some of the waiters are probably inexperienced.  As for the food - it was just as I expected.

Cristelle J.,"San Francisco, CA",173,226,20,4.0,7/14/2009,----Amber is the best server here------- Yesterday was the first I ever went to this particular Red Robins and needless to say with all the reviews my hopes weren't too high...but after experiencing my dinner I must not agree with some of the other bad reviews.  1) Right when the boyfriend and I were just walking up the steps someone opened the door for us immediately. chilvary isn't dead :)  2) +1 star. After we walked in we witnessed a pair being walked out the front because well they brought like caged animals in maybe ferrets. And when the manager told them they weren't allowed to bring animals into the building because of health codes...they were actually astonished. And I called those people stupid. 3) -1 star. Before sitting down we had to wait for a server...and here's the reason: We were okay with waiting for servers it was just the fact that there were 3 servers on the counter chatting up about idunno sales at the mall. Very distracting. 4) After being seated our server Amber immediatley asked us if we wanted a drink...(now this is where it starts getting good) Within 2 minutes we were brought our beverages and throughout the whole dinner I never saw the bottom of my glass. Amber consistently switched out my glasses before I even asked infact I never had to ask for a refill and I LOVE THAT! This is how I see it you pay 2.95 for a drink right?! Complete rip off!!! Now when you get service like what Amber did it feels like you got your money's worth :)  5) When our appetizer came out..not even 5 minutes later our entrees came out. Normally I would be a little upset because my food will become jealous of eachother haha no. I just like enough time to savor each meal and when both meals came out Amber quickly noticed and apologized to our table.

First of all Im giving 2 stars because we like the food and our waitress was friendly when we did see her.  However it took awhile for her to come by and take our drink and food orders and when she saw we needed refills she said she would be back in a few with more drinks but a few was generally like 10 minutes.  A different person brought out our food and we asked that person for a couple things of ranch as my Hubby had a salad with no dressing and I wanted some for my fries, but the person never brought our ranch nor told our waitress.  I also remembered I wanted mustard for my veggie burger.  So our food sat in front of us for at least 10 minutes gettin cold before we finally saw our waitress and asked her for ranch and mustard and then it took her 5 min to bring it out.  While we were eating the manager came by with a tray full of baskets of fries.  She shoved one down next to my basket of food and said ""fries?"" As I looked up at her confused since I hadn't asked for more, I still had half of mine left and was getting full.  I shook my head no still confused and she said ""well they are bottomless and maybe your waitress thought you would want them"" then she walked off to the next table to offer fries.  I was confused and now had a full basket of fries that would be going to waste crowding our table.

Alan J.,"Oakley, CA",14,388,3,4.0,7/20/2011,"You're probably gonna wonder why four stars when reading this but bear with me and I can explain. Having been to a red Robin in fairfield before and waiting forever for food (We were positively anorexic by the time we ate) I have avoided these places for years. This one is right by the rave theater and although we have passed by before have never stopped. We took a swing and figured why not. The place was half empty and not noisy, they took us to our seats and gave is the menu without problem. The waitress came and took our order without problem, she was fantastic. Problem? She was only covering while JD was on break. Yikes, big let down. They lady would come and refill drinks, ask if you needed anything without having to be waved at or anything. JD? You could send up a signal flare and he still wouldn't see you. He continued to serve other tables and fly about from place to place without so much as looking our way, (I tried tripping him but he skipped over my leg and continued on). Now why the four stars? The food baby all about the food. Now bear in mind this is a buger/fast food joint but the chicken I had was advertised as hot and spicy. OMG! Did they understate that. WOW what a great surprise, normally hot and spicy for a chain means mild and meager. This place should serve a fire extinguisher with this one. I love it.

R. P.,"Discovery Bay, CA",4,30,,1.0,4/20/2010,"Let me start off by saying, I have never EVER walked out of a restaurant... Until I came here. I have been to this location a total of 3 times.  The first time, it was OK. The food was decent, the service wasn't great, but because it was new, I gave them the benefit of the doubt. Went again, with some family. Again, not bad, not great.  Now for the grand finale (prepare for a novel). We walk in, and the place is deserted. There are exactly two tables occupied. We're seated by one of the 5 hosts standing at the front counter, after they argued about which would seat us. After we were sat, we waited.. and waited.. and then we waited. I looked at my clock for a reference. We had to be sitting at least ten minutes with people walking by and around us, not saying a word. This always pisses me off. At least say ""I'll (or someone) will be right with you.""  Anyhow this chick finally comes over after we are there for about 20 minutes, and she really tried to walk away without taking our order. Hubby ordered a beer, the rest of us, simple drinks (there were 4 at our table). After another ten minutes, we still hadn't seen our drinks.  Let me mention here that by this point there were 2 new tables near us occupied and a new table came in much after. Inattentive waitress had taken the other 2 tables orders by this time and had greeted new table. After about 13 minutes I went to the host and asked if she could ask someone about our drinks. I couldn't find anybody and not even the fountain drinks had come. There was no excuse. About 3 minutes later, the manager brings us our drinks and says "" the bar was backed up."" Really? It's a beer not a specialty mixed drink, not to mention there isn't another person in the darn place drinking. WTE.  Non-caring waitress comes by a few minutes later to tell us they are ""traying up"" our food. Fine. I'm just a LITTLE irritated by the fact that the table that ordered after us has gotten their drinks, appetizers, AND food.  So after another 15 minutes and seeing not only the other 2 tables get their food, but the LAST table besides us, who came in at least 20 minutes after us, get their food, we were DONE. My blood was boiling. We walked out and nobody even noticed. They probably didn't care anyways.  I cannot stand servers who disappear. Are my drinks taking too long? Say something.. ""sorry, It'll be just a moment,"" would suffice. Food taking too long? LET ME KNOW. I'm not a cold-hearted betch. I know stuff happens. But by you ignoring me, you piss me off, and that 20% tip I start off intending to give, dwindles.  I can swear on anything I will NEVER return to this location.  It's sad because I have fond memories of the Concord location. Love that one.  Brentwood Red Robin, Piss off. You disgust me.

When she finally brought our drinks, she also took our orders, 3 cheeseburgers all with NO tomato and a salad with ranch. Well a half an hour later when our food finally arrived, one cheeseburger had tomato on it, one order had 3 french fries in the basket and the other cheeseburger was cooked wrong. The salad was great. Our waitress wasnt seen again until she brought us the bill. We needed a new bottle of ketchup, so we grabbed one from another table which was empty as well. So I tok both bottles to the bar tender and oh look there was my waitress standing and talking not doing anything. She said she would bring a new bottle of ketchup so I walked back to the booth. Well it appears she forgot, because as she took drinks to a table near us she asked the bartender to bring us ketchup..... A manager walked by a few times but didnt smile, or even acknowledge us.

The issue today was more with service and attitude and the bottomless fries policy.  The idea of having as many fries as you want is a great one at first sight. However, not when the corporate office puts limits on it. When we talked about it with our waiter, it told us that the corporate office puts a limit of 3 oz of fries per serving (we counted about 6 fries). So when you first get your order all you get is about half a dozen fries. Then it takes the waiter forever to bring you more when you ask for more and again you get about 3oz as per the corporate policy, then again if you want 6 more fries you wait even longer. At each round the wait is longer. So I say get rid of this offer which is bogus, bring a nice serving of fries with the original order and be done with it, since Red Robin is being cheap about it. I am going to write the corporate office about this. The waiter tried to be accommodating as much as he could. Not a fun experience. My husband and I decided that when we go back we will immediately ask for our refill when we give the order so we can have at least 12 fries each when we first get our burger. Because by the time we ask for our second basket we will be done with our burger. That's how long it took this time and we don't eat fast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=380
Terie N.,"Brentwood, CA",25,1,,2.0,7/2/2009,"I have been there twice now within a couple days... others wanted to try it out so I came along for the ride. What are the chances that I would get the same server both times. Once in the evening, the other in the afternoon.    The first time I had Carrie as a server I was a bit surprised that after a five minute wait we were greeted with ""are you ready to order?"" we weren't, but I think the offer of a beverage would have been nice. We probably waited another 5 minutes for her to come back and take our whole order at the same time.    The drinks didn't take to long to come out. I ordered the Baileys shake, my friend ordered another beverage with alcohol. Neither of us could taste any alcohol in our drinks, mine tasted like a vanilla shake.     Our server came back about 15 min. later and our food still was not our yet, she told us that the grill went down so it was taking a little while longer, even though my friend was facing the kitchen area and was watching food coming out, at a table not to far from ours sat a group of managers, I would think that if the grill truly went down that they wouldn't be sitting down not doing anything about it. She did have one of the managers come over and talk to us, but, he said they had a little fire in the kitchen and that was what was taking so long. Once again, my friend was sitting facing the kitchen and I think she would have noticed if there was a fire.    Our food finally came out about 1/2 an hour after ordering. My server set my food down in front of me and called me Ms. Picky since I ordered my burger withour onions or pickles. Hmmmmm, never been called that before. By the time I got my food, my drink was empty. I was not offered another drink but given a glass of what tasted like water right out of the tap. Yuck.   I do agree with the review that had the comment about the restaurant being noisy. It was almost deafening when it was time to sing a birthday song.     I was at first amazed that their fries were refillable, until I got my burger.... only a handfull, that would explain it.    I will not go back unless someone I am with wants to go. Not that impressed with the service, food or management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=380
David R.,"Galt, CA",2,17,,5.0,8/17/2010,"I have been to this Red Robin several times. The first time that I went I got the best service of my life... My drinks and fries were always full and I didn't even have to ask. Since then I have gotten average service, but the food quality is always great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=380
H P.,"Brentwood, CA",4,40,1,1.0,1/20/2011,"Honestly, this place is average, or even a little below average. I had never been to RR before, but I decided to try this location the week after Christmas before going to see a movie around lunchtime. The place was busy. We were seated immediately, even though the hostess seemed slightly confused when we asked to sit at a table. Our waiter was nice enough, but he messed up both of our orders! He fixed it and made sure we had what we needed. However, I was not impressed with the Avocado Burger.... it was mediocre and the flavor wasn't as good as the avocado burger at Chili's. The only good thing about this restaurant is the french fries. But, I probably wouldn't return to a place just for fries.... Sorry, RR! Also, it is disgusting to look out the window while you're eating and see an employee or two, still wearing their aprons, smoking cigarettes. Completely unsanitary and probably against some type of rule or law. Yuck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=380
Andre B.,"Stockton, CA",2,9,,1.0,7/29/2009,"1st impression is the most important, thats why i hope the service we got at this red robin wont reflect the type of service the rest of them have to offer. when 5 people are seated after you and after you have already ordered but they get their food first when all you ordered was a sandwich and shrimp, you kinda wonder if they forgot about you. you know they forgot about you when you get your food and its cold. you wait an houre for your food of course your starving so you eat anyways. server offeres you a new plate but guess what? you already ate half of your meal so you ask if you can talk to a manager. they offere you 25% off the bill. is that ok? on top of the extreamly unclean mens and ladies bathroom? for me its not its the biggest insult ever. 25% covered the milkshake and soda woopdeedoo. server was a ditz manager didnt know what they were doing. ide come back here maybe 3 or 4 years from now, hopefully they would have changed the staff and management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=380
