Cherokee J.,"Grand Ledge, MI",11,4,,4.0,1/8/2018,They have the best chicken sandwiches! Our waitress Alyssa was great at her job as well! The only negative thing I have to say is their fries aren't good at all. Very bland and too thick,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton
Gabby G.,"Acworth, GA",2,132,118,4.0,5/15/2017,"I've had good & bad experiences at Red Robin and I can state my one and only visit to this location was one of the good ones. I sat at the bar, which was clean and had a descent appearance. I was happy it was full service (cocktails) and the 2 bartenders were courteous and provided good service. I ordered a medium-rare, Black-n-Blue burger and have to state, it was delicious, cooked as ordered, and have zero complaints. I enjoyed my meal, my beverages, and service. I know the fries are unlimited but I was stuffed with my initial plate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton
Mariel C.,"Lyon Charter Township, MI",0,69,13,2.0,6/17/2017,Normally I have good experiences at Red Robin's but my experience at this location was below average. 2 out of 3 meals ordered arrived cold and we had to request napkins and utensils. Floor was sticky in the restrooms as well...looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a while. Not sure if I would return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton
B B.,"Holly, MI",1,8,,1.0,8/19/2017,"Don't eat here. Place was mostly empty for a reason. Lousy service. An eternity to take our order, refill drinks - yeah right! Forgotten items (garlic bread, sauces etc) food presentation was nothing like normal Red Robin's we have been too. When food FINALLY got there, the fries were cold.  Writing a complaint letter to headquarters. Should've checked YELP ahead of time. 2.5 stars is generous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton
Amy M.,"Beaver Dam, KY",5,4,,2.0,6/1/2017,I want to start by saying that Red Robin is one of my favorite restaurants. However the one in Brighton MI was terrible. Fries and Burgers were over cooked and the waitress seemed to think we were a bother to her. I'm here on a Business trip so I doubt I will ever return. But I am pretty sure I wouldn't regardless.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton
Kathleen B.,"Brighton, MI",6,23,6,4.0,9/9/2016,"I've been here a few times and every time I'm here the service is good and so is the food.  The servers that i had tonight were very attentive. I sat at the bar by myself. Both bartenders made sure that i was satisfied with my food and drinks. Even a couple people that came behind the bar to do something asked me questions.  Everyone that i have encountered here has been very personable, polite and they all seem to enjoy their jobs. That is a huge thing with customer service. There are so many people that just do their job for the paycheck and others that do it cuz they enjoy it.  I will definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton
Sarah H.,"White Lake, MI",46,483,246,3.0,7/14/2015,"Eh... This place isn't bad but it's not great either. Service was a little slow but our food came out correctly. Not the greatest on refills either. I like the variety of food they have, the wraps and onion rings are great. The five alarm burger it's also very good. The kiddos give the chicken tortilla soup a thumbs up!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton

Jenny O.,"Chelsea, MI",0,9,,1.0,11/6/2016,"The allergen menu is awful to try to find what you can and cannot eat.   It's nice that you can plug in your allergies but it lists  a few listed things that you can eat with the many things that need to be removed.   It's just a name of s burger with the list of stuff you can't have so then you have to find this item on the regular menu to see what is on the burger.  Other than blue and American cheese in this list you can't tell what cheeses are safe.   I can never tell what cheeses are safe because I can't find them.   Servers never know where to find this info and are not helpful.    I question how accurate this list even is because I also had soy listed as an allergen and items know to contain soy like mayo are listed as ok to eat.   If you are going to provide allergen info , make sure it is accurate and complete and train your employees.  Now I remember why I don't eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton
Travis S.,"Howell, MI",0,4,,1.0,2/12/2017,"Unfortunately we will not be visiting this Red Robin location again anytime in the near future. We were sat in the front area by the bar where sadly the bar tender was also waiting every table in the area... that means we sat for almost 15 minutes before even being greeted then another 15 for drinks and the thing was it wasn't even the waitresses fault, they set her up to fail. After finally ordering, our food was brought out completely wrong. First of all don't give the option as to how the burger is cooked if the cooks can't make a burger to order. Our burgers ordered medium were so raw they were still bright red and looked how raw hamburger looks, like worms! Secondly don't tell me that barbecue sauce is steak sauce and that the ""blue ribbon"" burger has this on it (when I order this every time) and NO blue cheese. There are plenty of other restaurants in Brighton, if you don't want to be disappointed choose one of those.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton
David C.,"Brighton, MI",0,15,,3.0,5/5/2016,Red Robin is pretty good. Good sized burgers nice and juicy. Love the endless fries. Gets a bit crowded and noisy in the evenings and on weekends. A little bit expensive if you're taking a family. I like it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton
Ken R.,"Highland charter Township, MI",0,2,,1.0,1/2/2017,Completely sucks.....over 50 minutes for a couple burgers and completely cold with coagulated cheese and basically frozen fries.......no wonder I only went once years ago and will never go back!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton
Gladdy 7.,"Howell, MI",2,20,10,1.0,9/26/2015,Our waitress was really nice but the food wasn't good. When we ordered onion rings they gave us soaking wet plates.

John Y.,"Detroit, MI",0,9,3,4.0,4/13/2016,"As far as I'm concerned, this Red Robin does well for a chain restaurant. I've almost always had good service, the food is generally satisfactory, and consistent. While I do think the burgers and other sandwiches could be a bit better for the price, I almost always am here for the happy hour wings which are some of my favorite wings anywhere. Traditional (bone-in) with the Buzz Sauce (a garlic-heavy version of a classic Frank's and butter buffalo sauce) can't be beat, especially for the $5 happy hour price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton
Tamara H.,"Troy, MI",0,7,,1.0,5/2/2016,"My mom and I went to this Red Robin for lunch yesterday and today we are both bedridden after being sick multiple times throughout the night. From the beginning, the experience itself was not very good. The host seated us in a booth in the bar area and told us ""you guys can sit in this booth because I don't feel like walking to the back (of the restaurant), and yes, the table is clean but all of the tables here are old so they look gross"". We would have been fine being seated at this table, but all of his comments were weird and unnecessary. Then our waitress came over. She was pretty nice, we ordered a water with lemon and a freckled lemonade. She brought the water over a few minutes later (it didn't have a lemon) and told us that she could not find the bartender so it would be a few minutes for the freckled lemonade. About ten minutes later, she brought the lemonade over and we placed our orders. The bar area of the restaurant was not busy at all so it was kind of frustrating that it took almost 20 minutes to place our order. I ordered the garden burger with fries and my mom order the whiskey river BBQ burger with fries. The food came pretty quickly and tasted good. Once she brought our check, our server asked us to fill out the survey and give her a ten because ""it would make the managers like her more"". To me, the purpose of having a survey is to be honest about the experience and it was tacky that she was asking for a perfect review. The only thing that our meals had in common were the tomatoes, lettuce, and fries, so I'm not sure what caused both of us to be so sick, but after a subpar experience and now dealing with this over 24 hours later, I will not be returning to this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton
CR B.,"Oregon, OH",0,43,2,4.0,3/29/2016,"This is an excellent restaurant and has a great decor, excellent service, and very good burgers. Our bill got up there pretty high. They have shakes and things the kids had to have. Then the appetizer. Then the food. Overall, it is not bad priced, but there is a lot to pick from. By the way, the salads are huge and have more calories than the burgers... by far. But as far as value goes, they are worth it. you can eat one salad over two meals. Our waitress Ginny was awesome. We stopped here from Toledo on our way to  frankenmuth, because we had never tried it. Overall, a great place. Again, I am not a big fan of the big corporate behemoths for various reasons that are inherent in that system, and most people are shifting that direction. But they have darn good food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton
Vic G.,"Savannah, GA",2,17,4,2.0,10/31/2015,"Meh Food would have been ok if hadn't been waiting for us in the kitchen with our name on it, while we sat at the bar.  Burgers were cooked as we had asked but all our food was cold.   Come on guys you're a burger joint, how hard is that!

Kristin M.,"Hartland, MI",1,63,27,3.0,4/11/2015,"If you want to eat Red Robin, it's a must to order eat in. I try not to judge harshly after one visit, but after 2 attempts at carry out, we will not be ordering again. Our burgers were rare when we asked for medium well, which is something no 'burger' place should ever get wrong. The first time, they also forgot part of the order, something my husband hadn't noticed until after the 20 minute drive home.

Jiggity J.,"New Hudson, MI",0,14,,2.0,10/13/2012,"I typically go to red robin when I want a big tasty chain burger, which is not terribly often as I try to humor small businesses if I can help it.  When I go to RR I know that, while the service may vary, the burger is typically always consistent.  Oh, what's this? They have a smaller burger size? That's cool as it's about time.  We went in with the intention of splitting a guacamole bacon burger and a round of fries as we aren't big people and that's more than enough for us.   Our entree arrives and it actually fits in our mouth. How peculiar as this has never happened before.  Also, the bacon had the soggy grossly undercooked consistency you expect at burger king.  This has never happened to us at a RR before.  It tasted overly-smokey, the guacamole had zero flavor, and the worst part was IT WAS EXTREMELY SLOW there (not the service, but almost no customers), so the undercooked bacon was pretty much unforgivable.   I highly suspect since we were being 'cheap' they may have slipped us the smaller burger, because we don't usually leave there saying we could eat still.  It could be RR has downsized the burgers?  I don't eat there hardly ever so if someone could validate if a change has happened in burger size, please let me know.  I would humor another location, but not if im paying 10$ for basically half the burger I've had in the past.  I'm seriously considering writing corporate to ask.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton?start=20

Kara D.,"Village of Clarkston, MI",31,215,272,3.0,1/21/2013,"I enjoy Red Robin, but this was not a location I would likely return to. For one, the parking lot is very strange as far as layout goes. Second, our service left us wanting more. Known for prompt drink refills, etc. we were often left thirsty. Third, the food presentation and wrapping of the burgers wasn't great.

Kayleigh D.,"Bradenton, FL",2,2,,1.0,6/17/2014,"My boyfriend convinced me to go to dinner at this Red Robin, which I've only ate at once prior. WORST SERVICE EVER! I am a waitress at a restaurant and I always give servers the benefit of the doubt but this was the absolute worst experience of my life. It took about 10 minutes to be greeted, another 10 to bring me my water with lemon and I never got the lemon. My burger came out wrong, turns out the server never rang some of my toppings in. The manager didn't even care when we complained! I never got a napkin or the boxes I asked for, I noticed he had 2 other tables but come on how hard is it!? The table next to us also complained and got some of their meal taken care of. We ended up almost being late for our movie because that's how slow this guy was. I tipped $4 on $30 which I always tip 20%, as you should, but this was terrible and I will never be back and I will tell people about my experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton?start=20
Paula K.,"Boynton Beach, FL",78,115,37,2.0,3/9/2013,"We have been to this restaurant quite a few times since my first review. It is generally good but after the visit we had tonight, I don't believe we will be going to this location again. I contacted them with our ""experience"".  Below is a copy/paste of the contact: My husband & I arrived at 5:50pm. He dropped me at the door and I went in and was put on a list. We were 2nd on the list and was told it would be about a 10 minute wait. It started to get crowded pretty quickly. Two tables were called, a party of 2 and a party of 3. Then a  young girl came in with her boyfriend and she apparently knew one of the hostesses because she came over to chat with her. They were seated immediately. My husband had seen them in the parking lot and they came in after us so my husband asked why they were seated first. He was told that they had left and had come back. My husband heard a hostess say BEFORE they were seated that ""OUR"" party was next. Then ANOTHER table of 3 was called that came in after I had been waiting over the 10 minute time. THEY too were called so I went and asked what was happening. I was ALSO told that these people had come in earlier but were outside waiting. There were NO people outside waiting when I came in. Two more names were called. We waited until 6:25 and then we just gave up and left.( We had waited 35 minutes on a quoted 10 minute wait time).  It might be a good idea to have a manager check on the wait from time to time. Skipping around on the list like these girls were doing was ridiculous. Our previous visits to this location have been good but we will have no trouble finding a restaurant that seats according to the list and not after friends of the hostess get seats. EDIT- spoke with a manager who said she would be sending gift certificate because of what happened. That was Monday, called her back Friday and she said she had not had time to go to the office to get a certificate to send yet. Will update IF she actually sends it. Last edit- It took over two weeks. A twenty dollar gift certificate was sent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton?start=20
Tabitha M.,"Saline, MI",148,299,60,2.0,5/5/2012,"Ugh.  Talk about disappointing! First, let me say that I'm a fan of ""the bird"".  I frequented the Flint location once a month or so when I lived in that area.   This was a horrible experience!  We were seated promptly, but then it all fell apart.  We sat too long before being greeted.  When our server finally did come to the table, she was lackluster and seemed uninterested.  Drinks were slow to arrive, despite the empty dining room and lack of guests sitting at the bar.  I decided to try the sweet potato fries for the first time.  They were cold, thin and limp.  I had finished my whole burger before our server came back to check on us.  When I told her I didn't like the sweet potato fries, she looked like a deer in headlights--she had no idea how to respond.  She didn't apologize.  She then disappeared.  No offer of dessert.  We sat and sat and sat and sat.  My water was empty.  My drink was empty.  I didn't see her anywhere.  When she finally made it back to the table with our check, she apologized and said her manager couldn't figure out how to get the $.99 upcharge for the sweet potato fries off my bill.  What a nightmare!  I paid the bill and got the heck out of there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton?start=20

I don't think a bad review on a restaurant as well known as red robin is going to stop somebody from going there....you could go to any restaurant at some certain time and you might have a ""minor"" inconvenience. These people who write negative reviews should really think about how many things are going on in a restaurant all the time. There is bound to be a longer wait then expected sometimes...maybe a hostess says you are ""next"", when she is mistaken.....heaven for bid she make a mistake when it effects you...or your burger you ordered wasn't ""presented well enough for you"". People, give it a rest and give people a break...you are not the only person on this planet that matters....and if you are going to take the time to write a review and criticize trivial meaningless things..I suggest you take a breather and look at the big picture of life.
