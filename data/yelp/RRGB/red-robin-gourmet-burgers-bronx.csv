Janice M.,"Bronx, NY",274,72,221,3.0,10/19/2017,"This was my first time ever at this establishment.  I didn't want a burger so I decided to try the fish and chips. I ordered a blue moon which came in a giant pilsner glass ( thank you Octoberfest!!) nice that they placed a orange on the rim. The fish and chips were piping hot and crispy, the fries not so much and I did ask if they could be crispy , just a few were. Abdul our server was a gem! he chatted a few times with us, and checked a couple of times to make sure everything was ok. You do get refills on fries and I think one time on soft drinks.  I wouldn't mind coming back, the food is very affordable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bronx
Shoshana R.,"Bronx, NY",30,98,311,2.0,6/1/2017,"Who doesn't love the opportunity to indulge in a good burger and some fries... well the operative word here being good. When you decide to treat yourself you want the cheat of added calories to be worth the extra time you will have to owe at the gym. This was not the case on this Red Robin experience. It was a Saturday afternoon (4/22) we were seated within 10 mins and waited approximately 15mins for our waitress to greet us. Our waitress was wonderful. She was on point and attentive. However, the experience was still bad and it was not her fault. Yes it was a Saturday but it was not extremely busy but the kitchen was horrible.  I was with a party of three and all three orders were wrong. I order a burger with a salad, my burger was incomplete and my salad was thrown on my plate instead of in the salad bowl it is usual put it. The other two orders, the sides were wrong and COLD. The offer of bottomless fries was just not that appealing because they repeatedly came out COLD!!! We waited over 20mins to finally get hot fries and to compensate our waitress spoke to a manger to offer us free dessert. That was very nice of her. We order the Croissant Donuts and they taste like fried oil. In the mist of the unpleasant experience the kitchen staff was loud and we heard things crashing and dropping.... maybe that's why they were unable to get the orders together because they were in the mist of having kitchen mishaps",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bronx
Greg J.,"Bronx, NY",231,44,163,2.0,7/13/2017,"I've been going to this location for a little over 2 years. Red Robin's loyalty card and all. My experience changes so often here.  PROS: The biggest selling point BY FAR is that their prices are low. I can get a restaurant meal for food court prices. They have a great birthday deal where you can get 1 free burger(minus finest/gourmet) during your birth month. Their loyalty program is pretty good. A lot of BOGOs and free milkshakes with qualifying purchases. They have a large menu as well.  CONS: I've had a few bad times when I've gone there. I've not received service for up to 40 minutes. I've been charged the wrong price multiple times due to lack of clarity in the upsell when placing an order with the Waiter. I almost decided to never go back because of an issue over $1. $1!!!!! I haven't seen that manager since; not surprised. This was after I was going every 2-3 weeks at the time. Loyalty only works 1 way at this location smh. Also sometimes this place will have a horrible smell on the weekends. It was to the point that I had to leave before placing an order. Also sometimes their staff causes scenes in the kitchen(i.e.- arguing, loud singing, being obnoxious). I'll go back in the future, but my trips will certainly not be as frequent as they once were after all the issues I've already had in 2017. Don't let there be a new burger restaurant open up in this area!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bronx
Rolanda B.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",19,92,147,2.0,7/6/2017,"This most recent experience was actually my better than my usual experiences here. It didn't smell today and it usually does. But he restaurant didn't exactly look the cleanest. Our waiter was nice, but there were long spurts of time betweenness when he checked on us.  And it took them a long time to bring me my bottomless fries refill. They are real stingy with the fries here. We also heard some loud noises coming from the staff in the kitchen.  Seemed lit back there but, I needed my bottomless refill though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bronx
Da Q.,"Brooklyn, NY",42,32,51,4.0,4/9/2017,"We got a great waiter His name was Rob: He gave us some great suggestions about the best burgers and he gave us caramel sauce for our pretzel bites, me and my foodie friends died and we're in glutton heaven. This place has pretty good service for it to be so busy and the waiters seem to be cool so  far.  I'm not sure how people had bad experiences here but i can tell you, this places is great so far, if you have any issues...  Ask for Rob...

Ivelisse M.,"West Bronx, NY",57,95,201,3.0,1/3/2017,TIP- Dont sit next to the door or you will freeze.

Verbal C.,"New York, NY",64,9,5,2.0,6/18/2017,"Well, let me start off by saying Happy Father's Day although there was nothing happy about this trip to Red Robin... Pause, let me take that back the salted caramel milkshake although the size description vs the actual size of the monster was a big difference.  Considering it was a Sunny Sunday afternoon I wasn't shocked when I was told it would be a 45 minute wait for the four of us to dine. Well much to my surprise it wasn't a 45 minute wait we were actually seated within 30 minutes. However it then took about 20 minutes for the waitress to come a greet us. & the Poor girl seemed disheveled. 1st we ordered a Salted Caramel milkshake monster size however when it arrived it was in a 8oz dessert cup... Then we ordered from the children's menu pizza  french fries & fruit cup with apple juice. We sent the pizza back because it was burnt the Apple juice tasted no parts of apple & all parts cold piss. When the pizza returned it was undercooked & cold ‍ So we gave up on that. Then we ordered The A1 Peppercorn burger. When this burger arrived it appeared as though it came from the kiddie menu. It was dressed incorrectly. No A1 sauce no Pepper jack cheese no crispy onions straws. & although we requested none... guess what- we got pickles. ‍‍ Btw, no where in the description of this burger did it say pickles. At this point we now know why the waitress gave us two orders of free fries before our food even arrived. Clearly she must've known the level of foolishness that was going down in the kitchen.  So now we are ready to blow this popsicle stand but the Kiosk on the table won't come on so we have to wait for the check. But instead of the waitress bringing an old fashion check 1/2 hr later she brings batteries for the Kiosk. & it still didn't work  The ambience of this restaurant leaves much to be desired of the basic needs, accessories & safety for a public restaurant. Both the men's & ladies room are behind one door &  then in separate rooms across from each other. If you survive the slippery slide walk from your table to the restroom once you open the door you were greeted by the stench of steamy slippery piss  & because I'm not trying to throw shade at this establishment I will say this one thing, they should implement a dress code... no naked sea creatures or unattended circus animals ‍ So I give this Red Robin in Bay Plaza 2 stars  because the milkshake while small was tasty and the two Screaming Zombies were very refreshing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bronx
Anna R.,"Bronx, NY",41,39,2565,1.0,4/28/2017,"Just plain terrible! Took 10 minutes to even get water. No napkins, forks or spoons at the table.

Daniela P.,"New York, NY",121,195,100,1.0,11/26/2016,"I had a really crappy experience at this Red Robin.  When we first arrived, we were asked to wait (even though there were obviously tables available). I let that go pretty quickly, remembering that I don't know exactly what happens behind the scenes and it's not the fault of the host.  We (table of four) were seated at a dirty, broken table. Someone came by a couple minutes after to clean it up, but the table was still extremely wobbly. (It could've easily turned over if we applied enough pressure to the side).  We let that go too. No-one came for about 10 minutes, so we were just there like sitting ducks. We noticed that there were seats available behind us, with no-one waiting in line, so we kindly asked the host if we could switch tables. He nodded no and did the stupid pointer finger gesture too, as if we were misbehaving toddlers. I have never been told that I couldn't switch tables, especially when there are SEVERAL tables available.  So, we were stuck at our broken table. Finally, our waiter arrives. He was nice but slightly clueless. He took our drink orders, and when we were about to ask him to take down our food order as well (given that we were left staring at our menus for 10 minutes or so we had plenty of time to decide), he was gone. It took him a while to come back, so we were again left waiting. I would like to add that this restaurant was not crazy-packed.  When he returned, we placed our simple orders. It took forever to get our food. Expecting to have an easy evening out, I was really disappointed and was getting very impatient. When our food arrived, our waiter didn't know which food belonged to who. He then proceeded to open up our burgers in front of us to find out. AGAIN, we were a table of FOUR. How do you mess this up? How do you think it's okay to touch people's food like that?  Our waiter disappeared for a majority of the evening. Our burgers left us unsatisfied. I would've been 100 times happier, if we had chosen to visit Five Guys instead. I wanted to get out of there as fast as possible, but that was made very difficult by our ghost waiter, who would stop by and then disappear for more than 10-15 minutes at a time.   I'll never visit this Red Robin again. The service was the worst I've had in a while, and the food was less than mediocre.  Step it up, people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bronx
Andy L.,"West Bronx, NY",203,106,1,1.0,5/9/2017,"We visited on a Tuesday night, and waited for about 5 minutes at the door (There were only two parties dining inside at the time and a server walked past us a few times).  We were eventually seated and were told that they did not have water, but conveniently could offer us ""beer, juices, or soda"".  Just a little odd as there were water cups at the other two tables.  With poor service and questionable integrity by the server, we took our appetites elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bronx
Quoc L.,"Manhattan, NY",184,233,391,2.0,4/7/2016,"I guess this is goodbye. Usually I'm the one with separation anxiety but you haven't made this decision so hard. There was that one incident where you spilled an alcoholic beverage on my friend, that was funny. That other time where my blood orange margarita came out after my meal. To add insult to injury... it was full of ice. The salt goes on the margarita glass, not my wounds. And lest not forget the perpetual waiting. Always. Waiting. What kept us coming back to this bad relationship of abuse were in fact your delicious delicious burgers. I'll even herald you as the best burgers of any given chain in the borough (and I like to think of myself as a fast food snob). But I drew the line the last time when the root beer was quoted as $5something and turned closer to $7 and my burger wasn't juicy... and my egg wasn't runny. Why ask ""how you want your eggs?"" when you won't deliver? Why? I'll swallow down this misfortune with my slightly overpriced root beer and my friends' resolve to not come back.

My mother and I came on a Sunday at noon. Great time to come!  We ordered the Tavern Special, which comes with two tavern burgers and an appetizer or dessert for $15. We ordered two Tavern Double Cheeseburgers, bottomless fries (of course), the pretzel bites though I prefer the onion rings and a monster milk shake (the Oreo!!). We shared the shake and it was perfection!  $20 and we were satisfied- that doesn't include tax & tip. Shakes and burgers are the best combination!

Nick M.,"Bronx, NY",80,27,18,4.0,9/11/2016,"We went to Joe's Crab Shack,was told 15 minutes -said they'd text me when my table was ready.  Place was mostly empty,so I suggested giving us some seats, get us some drinks and see us in 20 minutes?  ""Oh no we're understaffed."" Dafuq? So we went downstairs to Red Robin. 'Yummm?' I've had better dining experiences on Rikers Island: Told us 10 minutes,and that's the last good thing that happened. We sit down, order some drinks, and they tell us we can order off the pad on the table. (so what do I need you for?) I decline,but my friend plays some trivia games on it to pass the time. They bring the ladies next to us their appetizers and tell them, ""The dishwasher is backed up- I'll be back with some napkins for you, we don't have plates."" They didn't have flatware,either,so I gave them ours- we wouldn't need it for awhile,right? José brings us our appetizer- wings -and we get the ""Dishwasher is backed up we don't have any plates I'll be back with some napkins"" line. Neither came. I asked the hostess who seated us ,""Yo,what's the deal- you guys understaffed or what?""  She says, ""We normally don't serve people in here- I hooked you up."" Enter our wraps,with ""bottomless steak fries"". I told him ""I don't need a lot of fries, just make them well done."" They were as white as a fish's belly,and just as cold. ""I'll bring you some new ones."" He did. A birthday was being celebrated a couple tables over and the hostess sang,brought out a cupcake and said, ""Hey, I'm sorry, we're all out of candles."" It seems every order comes with a free side of bottomless excuses. My friend had had a birthday a couple of days ago, so I figured ""hey let's celebrate!""  I asked the waiter, ""Hey,it was his birthday- can I get a cupcake?""  ""Oh,no,but you can sign up for our rewards program."" ""No way,José- I'll buy the cupcake.""  ""No, you've gotta sign up for our rewards."" ""Dude- you think I'm coming BACK?! How about the check."" ""You can do it on the pad."" ""Nah,buddy- I'm good- I pay in cash and want something in my hand I can read."" I get the check- $1.99 for ""entertainment""? ""Oh, your friend was playing trivia on the pad."" ""It never said anything about $1.99."" ""Oh? Well it should've."" ""No shit- no worries- I'll put that on Yelp,too."" Bill was $43.00  I hand him $60. ""Do you want change?"" Avoid,avoid,avoid. Go somewhere in your neighborhood. This mall is no great shakes,AND you gotta pay for parking? Plenty of fine dining on Tremont Avenue in Throggs Neck,peeps. 9/11/16  I went back,against my better judgement but with their $30 gift card and my wife. They redeemed themselves. I had the Burnin' Love Burger,Amy had Salad and a couple sides of veggies. My burger was served the way I'd wanted it,hot and very tasty when it arrived. Jessie,our server,was very attentive and on her job. The manager was walking around making sure every table was happy.

Clam chowder was good too, also not as thick as I usually like it but I was craving and it met my craving so whatevs.  Clucks and shrimp..

Not sure if I can convey this story well, but I'll try.  RR has those touch screens at your table. You can hit a button to ""call service"" and a light goes on showing that you'd like service. We sat down, and after about 15 minutes of no one coming to us, I turned the call for service light on. About another 10 minutes went by, and then a waitress came over and said, ""why is your light on, you gotta turn that off or everyone's going to come over here and ask you what's wrong"".

Also, there was a couple that was there before a few people, and left because everyone else received their food well before them. I felt bad for the couple because Red Robins is burger joint, and it shouldn't take as long as it did to bring out the food.

There were only 3 waitresses working that night, a Saturday night at 8pm, which im really surprised about. We place our order and the waitress puts the wrong burger into the computer for my moms order. We caught the mistake on the individual table kiosk and told her and she blamed us for the mistake and then added the missing fried egg and bacon to the burger and charged us a lot more than the price of a Royal Robin Burger. My dad ordered a pint of Blue Moon and they didn't even have an orange to serve with it. I asked the waitress for extra BBQ sauce with my Whiskey River Burger when i placed the order and when the burger came it was missing so i asked again and the sauce still never came out. Ended u having to as one of the managers for the sauce and got it within 30 seconds. When the bill came we wanted them to all be separated by person and the waitress was giving us a hard time because of how she input my moms burger but that was not our fault.

Purpose T.,"Hillside, NJ",1159,301,100,2.0,1/17/2015,"I have to give this location less stars now. Only 2 stars because we were seated within 5 minutes of walking in. However, My experience last night was ridiculous. We waited OVER an hour for our food. Seriously, for a burger and some fries?! Absolutely makes no sense. Our server didnt bother to check in with us, give updates, offer beverage refills, NOTHING!! So since our waitress was MIA, I asked ANOTHER random server walking by to get the manager for us. The manager comes to our table with excuses about the main cook being arrested earlier so they were short in the kitchen. Blah blah blah!!! To be honest, I dont care and that doesn't justify the wait AND the poor service.  That's not it. It gets better (yeah right). On top of the wait, my sister's burger (specifically ordered well done) came out practically RAW. And the server says, ""but it tastes ok right?"" Uh hello!! She ordered a well done burger. AND the egg on both of our burgers was cooked and NOT sunnyside up, as they should have been. No surprise that we're totally done with this location. Do better red robin! Not on MY dime.

TastyLadiesNY P.,"Bronx, NY",319,185,1477,3.0,3/17/2015,"Tried out the new Red Robin in the Bay Plaza in the Bronx. Now I am no stranger to Red Robin, went to a few down in Florida and liked them. They have not only designer burgers off the charts here but they have salads, sandwiches, sides galore and entrees with full bar.  Just to give you an idea of what they have, we ordered to start pretzel bites with a beer cheese dip that was excellent! Also we ordered the Red's bold boneless chicken wings with your choice of dip, we chose whiskey River BBQ and they were standard.  I had a tough choice deciding between their huge array of designer, unusual burgers! I decided on the smoke and pepper burger with black pepper bacon and extra sharp cheddar cheese on a smoked ciabatta bun with house made smoke and pepper ketchup was very juicy and flavorful! I would have loved it to be a little spicer but still it was a good, solid burger with a side of garlic herbed fries with a garlic aioli sauce for dipping.  My partner had a garden burger with steak fries that was kind of ordinary, nothing special.  The restaurant was decorated in an eclectic style with pop art pictures covering the ceiling. The only pet peeve was the amount of noise coming from the kitchen with people arguing.  This place is a good casual dining experience with medium pricing.

The waitress is not aware of personal space or basic etiquette. Was annoyed that her grubby fingers were holding my beer by the lip.

Well....waiting and waiting....my son was driving me crazy with the complaining on how long they were taking for a damn corn dog and fries. After about 20mins the waiter comes back apologizing for the wait, I mean really and emptied place and a corn dog? A few moments later he comes back with the corn dog and cold fries...ridiculous.  I ordered the guacamole bacon burger, ugh burned on swizz cheese, over extremely crispy bacon, very toasted bun, and flavorless. Fries sucked.

Johanna O.,"Bronx, NY",39,22,5,1.0,11/29/2014,"Where should I start? Hum let me see, going to try to keep this short, I arrived at Red Robins (Co op, new mall location) at 7:40pm today Nov 29th. I decided to do a take out.  The young lady who took my order was very nice (didn't catch her name, if she introduced her self to me I wouldn't know because I was starvingggggg.)  I told her what I wanted so she placed my orders at 7:45pm hoping to leave within 20-25minutes top because my mom was waiting in my mom. I drank my milk shake (while waiting for my food), I looked at the time and it was almost half hour that had passed by and no food as of yet (okay!!)   Now its about 8:30pm and no food yet, the young lady told me (I'm so sorry about the wait they forgot to do one of your other orders (my facial expression).  Its now 8:40pm and my food arrived (about time!!!!!!!!!!)  (Heres where I get very upset) So the young lady hands me a cup which it was the little bit of what was left from my first milk shake to take home. I told her umm no I ordered an extra milk shake to go, she tells me I know the thing is that the amount of milk shake thats in the cup is a kids size, if you want more it would be the monster size(for $5 and change extra) and it depends on the person whoes making the milk shake (my facial expression 0_o)  I told her um no the last couple of times I've bought it, it was filled to the top not less half full, I'm the one paying for it, not the person whoes making it, shes trying to hustle me for $5 and change so she can put that money in her pocket? Nooo I don't think so!!!!!!. So the manager was called to resolve this little problem, which she resolved it by adding more milk shake.  Just because of this experience I'm never going back to this location! You official lost a customer.  Good bye Red Robins (Co op location).  P.S. When I got home I didn't even eat my food because it was super cold. I'm NOT a happy camper.

Co-op City is of course some what ghetto and this place seemed sort of that.  The food wasn't so bad. The classic burger I ordered however had too much seasoning at least for me. The boneless chicken I ordered I told them to put the sauce on the side but they still put it on top which didn't bother me much. The portions were however huge. The tower of onion rings were pretty good. The waitress was some what strange. She kept questioning my orders. I didn't want any ice for personal reasons and she said wow really no ice? I also didn't want tomatoes in my burger and she said wow who doesn't like tomatoes. She seemed all over the place but I'm sure she had good intentions. People here just need to be a little bit more professional.  The place is new so it is clean. The seating arrangements weren't the best. Tables were close to one another. Idk if I'll go back.

Food was good, had their bacon burger with bottomless steal fries. Would love to come on a date as the modern retro atmosphere was to my liking. Server was attentive and knowledgeable. However you can see they are a little understaffed and if they want to compenstate for their busy times they should hire more and make server sections smaller or either.  My best memory is the self service small kiosk tablets on each table from which it offers a variety of services such as pay your tab, order apps, drinks and even games for the little ones. The food was also good at temperature. Some of you guys should realize that when someone at the table orders a WELL DONE burger but someone else at the table orders a medium burger it isint magic to cook it. It doesn't pop out with the flick of the wrist by the cooks. Well done burgers on average take 10-25minutes to prep and present. With that being said it also does not justify one hour wait times some of you have reported especially on bottomless anything  or appetizers.

Went with the royal red robin as a meal(fried egg& bacon..mmm). They only do two temps (medium & well). I was impressed cause my medium did come out perfectly cooked! The burger itself was pretty delish! $11 w/fries (not a big fan of steak fries but it is what it is) not pricey at all. I do think it's very cool they put a plastic lid on the glass cups for kids in case of spills. Service- Main reason why this is getting 2 stars. No lie, waited almost 20min until we got water! WTF?? The waitress was nice but honestly if you are taking 10yrs for everything I don't give a rat's ass how nice you are. Get it together sweety!

When she spoke, she made this popping sound with her mouth, that drove me crazy.  I requested a booth, which she was able to provide and this was the best seat in the house; to watch the ghetto action from the kitchen.  Our waiter came over in a reasonable time. He didn't seem very knowledgable but he was nice, so I worked with him. As we were giving our drink order there was lots of commotion in the kitchen right behind me. Whoa!!! I turned to see the chefs/kitchen staff/hood rats fighting. Like really physically!!! It took about 3 guys to hold one guy back, but he kept on charging the other guy. The manager was standing right there while the entire thing is happening trying to see which plates matches with the tickets. She really didn't seem bother or concerned. Weird!  Then there was this one girl I guess she was supposed to me expediting the orders to servers but she was just yelling and cursing. Oh but she was kind enough to come over and say ""yea I'm sorry if I'm cursing and it's bothering you but this shit is just crazy"". I chuckled, I had a bad day and watching the ghetto drama unfold in this place made me realize my job could be a lot worst.   Our waiter came over and was apologetic for the kitchen staff.

Carley S.,"Brooklyn, NY",14,2,,1.0,3/29/2015,"Seriously the worst place ever. I was a server for 8 years, so me and my husband are pretty patient and considerate people when it comes to bad service in restaurants because I've been there ... but come on...  We were sat at 9:20 after a 20 minute wait which was absolutely reasonable. Our server was a nice girl but it took her twenty minutes to bring us 1 beer and 1 coke. She apologized a couple times about the wait on the beer from the bar, but as far as I could see, the bartender was just chatting it up with some guests.  We ordered chips and queso dip as an app and 2 burgers for entrees. After waiting for out app for 45 minutes (apparently it takes a while to ladle some cheese dip into a ramekin), we told our server to cancel it because we were starving and just wanted out burgers. She said ok and left .. 5 minutes later she comes out with the app we just canceled and asks if we want it, so we say ok since it's better than nothing, right? Wrong.. She tells us it took so long because they were ""cooking the chips"", which is obvious because the cold, congealed queso must have sat in the window for 45 minutes waiting on those burnt-ass chips. We tried it and then told her we decided against it and she said ""I understand"". Why serve something you know isn't up to standards especially after we asked to cancel it?  We waited another 25 minutes (now 10:30) for our burgers and told ourselves that if it hits 10:35 and we still don't have food, we are going to pay for our drinks and go.. A minute later our server comes out and tells us that because our food is taking so long, a manager is going to bring it out in the next couple minutes. A few minutes later, a waitress comes out and offer what we guess is our food to a couple tables down, when they say no, she tries us. First off.. Not the entree my husband ordered at all and his wrong side. She says she is sorry and will see what the issue is and brb. Out comes our waitress with the same tray, just switched his entree to a new plate with the correct side. No dipping sauces we asked for, no pickles we requested, cold fries, etc etc. (I seriously didn't think things could be this bad) We tell her that it's not what he ordered and she tries to argue with us saying she will show us in the menu and leaves. She comes back with a coke I requested, no menu (to prove us wrong), no dipping sauces, and still no manager so I request one.  We ate a couple onion rings while we wait almost 10 minutes to speak to a manager until another server asked us if we need anything and I ask to see a manager again does one come out. At this point my husband had his coat on ready to go.  We told her the issues, and told her we just wanted to pay for our drinks and go. She offered to pay for them and apologized without remorse offering us fries to feed us (which I still don't get .. Why would I want to eat a bunch of fries right now?) should I even mention people who sat down almost an hour after us got their apps (same chips and dip) before we even got our burgers? All in all.. I get it, I've been there. It's Saturday, youre semi busy (although the dining area we were sitting in was half empty and the room next to us completely empty) but at least try to cover your ass? There should have been a manager stopping by our table 30 minutes into the app fiasco! Instead I just saw him chit chatting with the waitresses through the dining area... And don't argue with someone about what they ordered ... Even if they are wrong you suck it up and see what you can do to make it right!  We still left a small tip (because morally, I cannot) and also because I  get that sometimes a manager won't listen to you when you ask them 50 times to stop by a table and you can't always control what the kitchen will send out.

allen b.,"NY, NY",2,51,,2.0,9/19/2015,"Went on Thursday 9/17. Service was not good. I was told at other locations the fries come out immediately, they didn't. There was an issue where the server had to order our appetizer from the console on the table, so it was delayed coming out. My wife got the wrong milkshake TWICE before they got her the right one. I believe the waiter was new, but there was no reason the food should have taken that long. We were never offered refills on our fries.

Carisa R.,"New York, NY",26,11,10,5.0,8/26/2015,"I love this place! The burgers are always on point! My favorite is the Royal Red Robin burger-I love the egg on the burger, and it's great sunny side up or fried all the way. The burgers are cooked to your liking. I like mine medium rare, and they always get it right. The best time to visit is late in the day and off peak times. I never have a problem getting seated here. Walked in tonight and ordered my food to go at the bar. Their drinks are awesome as well. I love the orange cream drink that is made with orange soda and whipped cream. If you like orange creamscicles you will love this drink! They have an alcohol version which is just as good. I'm not a huge fan of the large cut fries, just not my preference. However, their sweet potato fries are perfection. Pricing is great as well. Great food for the family to enjoy!

Alan S.,"Bronx, NY",1,49,,3.0,11/13/2015,"This place is hit or miss. DO NOT EVER GO HERE FOR DINNER. We went here once for dinner and it was a complete nightmare. Took over 30 minutes for food. Ordered the bottomless fries and my dad WHO TAKES FOREVER to eat actually finished his meal. I had to say forget it. However 80 percent of the time it works for lunch and the burgers come within 15 minutes. Has a nice bar area too. And staff is normally friendly. So yeah this place sucks for dinner but is quite good for lunch. My one complaint is the bottomless fry refills are NEVER ready in a decent amount of time. The waitress explained to me once that it's because they ""focus on appetizers"" unlike other Red Robins and they don't ""have a window"" like others so the fries take longer to make. I still find it odd since they're FRIES. You'd think they'd always have a batch already. Not the waitresses' fault since they have to say what their boss tells them but I wonder if that's the stock line the manager tells them to say. Part of me suspects they purposely take forever to discourage people from ordering more fries. So yeah in summary, crappy for dinner but great place for lunch. But they really need to step their game up when it comes to the bottomless fry refills. Don't advertise it if you can't keep up with demand. EDIT: Went here for lunch today, and everything was great and the bottomless fry refill came RIGHT AWAY!  So yay, and I hope they keep it up!

Nivea M.,"Bronx, NY",224,101,84,1.0,3/23/2015,"So I've been to this location a few times since it opened, each time hoping that my experience would be better than the last. However it seems to have gotten worse each time that I've been and Saturday night was officially my last time going to this location. Each time that I've gone *something* has been off, whether it be my food, my  drink, or the service.  Twice I've gone during early evening hours when it wasn't at all busy yet I still had to wait extraordinarily long for my food (no less than a half hour each time). The times that I've gone after hours I was much more understanding about a longer wait time but I have very little patience for it when there are only a handful of other people in the restaurant.  Once I went and my burger was burnt and another time my drinks were so weak I wondered if there was any alcohol in it all. But despite all these issues I've gone back to give them chance after chance, hoping that with enough time they'd get themselves together. This all changed on Saturday night when I had horrible service that left a terrible taste in my mouth. It was a 35 minute wait to be seated, and since it was a Saturday night that was understandable. But what I can't get over is the fact that I waited a half hour just to get a glass of water. My waitress never actually introduced herself to us. She took the order of the table next to us which arrived at around the same time as us, and instead of taking our order and putting them both in at the same time, she told us she'd ""be back in a minute"". 10-15 minutes later another waitress came saying she'd be subbing for our waitress. Throughout the night our original waitress had spirited discussions with the table next to us while barely addressing us until towards the end when she came a few times to ask if we were okay, but by that time it was too late. I've been here enough times now and not once have I had a great experience. The wait times are out of control, and the mediocre food is so not worth the terrible service. I refuse to give this place anymore of my money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bronx?start=80

Nicole P.,"Bronx, NY",0,5,,1.0,12/6/2016,"What was meant to be a fun night out at your restaurant did not end on a high note. Firstly, I sat down at the bar and asked the waitress if this particular store was participating in the T-Mobile Tuesdays promotion. For this day only they were offering a free appetizer up to a $5 value with the coupon. She replied yes and I ordered the tortilla chips appitizer which cost $4, along with other items. However this waitress in the middle of my meal switched me to a heavy set Latina waitress (best description I can give) who was rude and rolled her eyes at me and my dinner mate. When we were ready to pay our original waitress informed her (in front of us at the bar) that our appetizer is supposed to be free and for her to have the manager subtract it from the bill. Well the rude waitress abruptly appeared again And in huff said their only taking $3 off our bill so we have to pay the remainder for our appetizer. I stated that I did not understand because that was not the stipulation of the promotion and she cut me off in a snarky tone mumbling that I ought to be grateful I was getting any discount at all. I wanted to speak to the manager but my dinner mate and I were so disappointed in how poorly we had been treated in your establishment, we paid and left. This definitely has ruined my dining experience at Red Robin and I would not recommend that location to anyone else. In addition, during my meal in front of me the staff would gossip about other customers in a grotesque way that horrified me. Please I urge you to get new management and staff at that location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bronx?start=80

When he finally did bring it, there was no ice in it. Then the food came out and it pretty decent. I actually enjoyed the burger and fries. We however didnt see our server again until we asked for the check. I know he was busy but he completely ignored us.

The manager came by just to see how our food was and we told her the red velvet was yummy but the brownie not so much. We were just letting her know expected nothing from it.

They have a great selection of appetizers and although everything is deep fried, if you feel like breaking your diet, it's worth it! The lemonades are very sweet and tastes best when you dilute it with water. The turkey burger was amazing and the patty was well seasoned. The bottomless fries are a plus.

Jonelle P.,"East Bronx, NY",61,61,81,3.0,1/30/2016,"This was my first time going to Red Robin in general. Overall the atmosphere was nice and casual. I went after work and sat at the bar. The servers and bartenders were very nice and helpful. I wasn't incredibly hungry so I just stuck to the appetizers. I ordered the onion rings and the boneless wings which were served over potato chips. The onions rings were really good. The wings were mediocre at best. I had a margarita which was decent but too much on the sour side. I also had a peach sangria which was pretty meh. One cool aspect is that there's a little tv in front of you so that your able to order another drink or something else off the menu if your server isn't there. You can also request the check that way. The restaurant, despite being on the first level has horrible cell phone service. If you need to use your phone, you have to go near the doors. Otherwise, you have no bars whatsoever. Even the free Bay Plaza wifi that connects doesn't give you more than maybe one and a half bar. Overall, it was an ok experience. Not sure of I'd go back though. One of those places, you pop into because nothing else is open.

My wife and I came for a late lunch like around 3pm and the place was super empty.  The hostess was really sweet and so was our waitress. When we ordered she asked questions to make sure everything we wanted was correct. Our small onion ring tower came out like 5 mins after we ordered them our drinks as soon as we asked for them.

After 20 minutes, we used the call server function on our device to see what the status was or if the bottomless fries or broccoli could be delivered before the remainder of the food. The other server came over again to check on us. He told us he couldn't serve us and hailed Peter again. He said he would check on the food. 5 minutes later he came back with our food. Unfortunately, my wife's burger was over overdone and our broccoli was cold. Also, there was no more bottled ketchup (he informed us that the whole restaurant had run out), although my wife spotted another bottle at another table. He brought it over then brought her ketchup packets.  It was a strange experience. It seemed like the other server kept trying to substitute for our server, Peter.

We got our burger and when we were basically done with our burgers is when we got out chili cheese fries. The timing here is just frustrating because the same thing happened last time. I enjoyed my burger but the cheese on the fries were cooled when it arrived and it just didn't make sense as to why it would be late if it looked like it was done maybe 5-10 minutes before.

The Server only comes when called and even after u press for the Server we waited about 5-10 minutes. This new system sucks!! This ""technology"" cause less interaction with the Server and to me it appears as if Red Robin is using this to hire less staff.

We walked into this place on a Sunday night around 9 pm , we were greeted by the hostess and I believe the manager. My husband and i always prefer to sit at the bar because the section is a little more private ( we are very private people) non the less the hostess said sure and we preceded to our normal booth. Well we were greeted by a very angry bartender who stated we could not sit in the bar area because she ""did not have any menus to distribute"" we then proceeded back to the hostess booth and told the hostess what has happened, they were very apologetic non the less, so we were seated at another table(not the bar... I still do not know why). We placed our orders, the appetizer was very salty, and the drinks were watered down. My husband stated that he did not want any ice in his drink and if they had to only a little bit, well when the drinks came and there was a whole bunch of ice (again i remind you we normally go here) he was not pleased, and for a person that never complains something has to be wrong.

From having no napkins at my desk, waiting for water and utensils, to the wrong drinks, and a non- chalant attitude from servers to management. I am beyong disgusted at the experience I just had at this facility, disgusted with Red Robin and how their allowing their employees to treat their customers, disgusted with the fact that I traveled past 4 applebees, 2 Fridays, 3 olive garden and probably 10 fast food facilities that could of gave my family and I a better experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bronx?start=100

The tables and floor stayed dirty and ignored until I finally brought it to the managers attention and expressed my disgust at having to look at garbage, he apologized and said that they were busy,but if you are so busy why would you not clean 6 empty tables that people could be sitting at. He then started cleaning and sweeping himself, too little way too late. The food took forever to come and when it finally arrived my fries were missing and it was not the burger that I ordered, not too mention it was burned.

Ahad A.,"Bronx, NY",0,3,1,2.0,2/23/2015,"Went there on a Sunday during lunch. It was me and my girlfriends first time and we expected it to be amazing but didn't turn out like that. Here's why: We were seated in the bar area. Ambiance was nice, there was no bar server just the bartender serving people at the bar and tables. Food was OK. We ordered chicken tenders with buffalo sauce and it was pretty dry and not your thick buffalo sauce at all(it was oily). For my meal I ordered one of their burgers . I asked for it  Med Well. When It came is was a medium and very pink inside. I ate half of it because service was very slow and I didn't want to wait any longer sending food back and I was hungry. When I flagged the waitress down and asked her that I ordered med. Well. She said we only make our burgers 2 ways: ""little pink or no pink"". That was the most absurd answer I heard from a waitress at restaurant  that prides itself on burgers. Why didn't she tell me that when I ordered the burger that they can't do med. Well? She asked to re do it but I was afraid it would take to long to come out and may come out extra dry so I declined. So that was it, no apology nothing more( seemed like she didn't care). Waitress never asked how our food was and had to ask 3 times for a cup of water. Also waited 15 minutes to pay our bill. I'm not nagging and I don't write many reviews about restaurants but I had high expectations for this place.  So bottom line. Don't sit in the bar area if you go there. Management needs to add a server in the bar area because the bartender clearly couldn't handle it and her service was below mediocre. The food is really not that amazing. I say average. But I guess this is expected  from a chain restaurant. I prefer Applebee's or UNOs, even though food is not the best atleast they care about their customers and give good service and that makes up for everything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bronx?start=100

We ordered our food and it isn't until about 1 hour that we all get our food. And 3 people in my group had a bad experience. One of My friends ordered soup and asked the waiter to get her a spoon. About 25 minutes passes by no spoon. She gets up to get it herself and no spoon. And she went to the kitchen and a hostess stopped her and told a guy he'll get the spoon. My friend comes back to sit down and 10 minutes later no spoon. I see a waitress and call her over to bring me a spoon and tartar sauce. She brings it out for us. Thanks for the spoon, now can you please heat up the cold soup?! She brings it to heat it up and our waiter comes back with the soup. My boyfriend ordered a beer before he ate. Didn't come until after he finished his food and said to the waitress he didn't want it no more because he had finished eating. The first drink he has was not that good. My brother in law got the beer/drink in a can and  it was watered down with ice. He told waiter to get another one with no ice and said what should I do? Tell the bartender? Well duh it's the waiters job to go tell the bartender not to put ice and make it taste like a real drink. Not watered down. And another friend his beer took almost 30 minutes after he ordered his first beer. The food I had was seafood scatter. It was alright nothing special. The cod didn't have flavor and the fries were alright. Hopefully next time it won't be a bad experience because if it is we won't come back to this Red Robin because the service sucked!
