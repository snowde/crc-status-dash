Ron L.,"Liverpool, NY",0,9,10,5.0,9/10/2017,OMG...Great burgers and endless steak fries. To top it off they have malt vinegar.  The waitress was very attentive  The place was nice and clean.  I had the macaroni which was creamy and delicious  Definitely going back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-camillus
James D.,"Corinth, NY",106,192,844,2.0,12/30/2017,"So that will be the only trip I make to Red Robin for quite a while.  I wasn't super enthused to go anyhow, but my Mommy twisted my arm because she had a 50 dollar gift card she'd won in some raffle or something, so since it was free I told her I'd go along.  Thank Little Baby Jesus that I didn't have to pay for our meals. Ordered the onion rings for an app and they were lukewarm and two of the rings had been battered and fried together, so they were stuck...the onion wasn't cooked through as a result.   I held out higher hopes for my burger, and while it was cooked medium as requested, it left soooooo much to be desired for a 12 dollar burger (see my pic).  Needed more bacon for sure and of course they only put 1 tiny tomato on it that covered maybe a third of a burger.  Why you gotta be so stingy Red Robin?  You had me seeing Red, I'll tell you that. Fries are definitely frozen and are soooooo far away from being the best fries served at a burger joint.  Dude, Five Guys fries crush RR fries, no doubt.   Then, as if I weren't already disappointed, the self-serve checkout kiosk dealio thingy wouldn't take my mama's gift card so we had to ask for our server, who was also tending bar quite aways away and very busy...I ended up having to go up to the bar to get her and she ended up taking payment from my mom there at the bar.   Anyhow, overall, total meh, and was worth what I paid...nothing.  I would've been quite unhappy if I'd actually had to pay for what we were served.  Honestly, it seems unconscionable that RR would charge what they're charging for such subpar burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-camillus
Jack H.,"Homer, NY",14,3,,1.0,7/17/2017,"My wife, daughter, son-in-law, granddaughter and I got there at around 4:30 on a Saturday afternoon. We were seated within 5 minutes and never spoke to another Red Robin employee until we left at 5:00. At that point I told the hostess we weren't waiting any longer. The timeline goes like this, we're seated, we wait 15 minutes and I press the ""Call Server"" button on the ziosk, five minutes later my son-in-law tells the hostess we haven't been waited on yet, 10 minutes later we leave.  The hostess, waiters, waitresses and busboys walked by us several times but it didn't register with any of them that we hadn't been waited on. Red Robin has these cute tablets, a ziosk, on the table that will let you play games, pay your bill and order appetizers among other things. One of the buttons is ""Call Server"". A light on the top of the ziosk turns on but it's just a trick, nothing happens. What finally clinched our departure was when a group that came in after we'd been waiting for 25 minutes, was seated and had a waitress at their table immediately. I briefly considered asking to speak to the manager but I was already hungry, wasted too much time on Red Robin and if the manager was as responsive as the rest of the staff I might still be waiting there. I was disappointed as I had been talking up Red Robin based on my first experience there a couple of months ago. We ended up going to Mo's BBQ Pit around the corner on Bennett Road. Outstanding. Red Robin also has a rule that prohibits anyone under 21 from being in the bar area. I don't understand this, if the under aged person is with their family. I've never run into this before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-camillus
Erin o.,"Syracuse, NY",0,46,4,3.0,6/25/2017,"Great food and service in the restaurant but don't order from Grubhub. Food is cold, late, and wrong. So disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-camillus
Matthew V.,"Syracuse, NY",17,18,,2.0,5/2/2017,"Nothing that terrible, but not a good value proposition. This was real wobble between a 2 and a 3 star. But I have to go 2 star because somethings just push you over the edge. For starters - the table payment and entertainment system charges 1.99 to play games. That's weak. Usually this is free or at most 99 cents. That's the most expensive I've ever seen for table-side games.  Some Burger King have free games man...   Our meals were ok and tasted good, but were not large and bountiful like you would expect for food that is priced around 14-15 bucks.  I had the 'cluck and shrimp' (chicken and shrimp) and that was only 2 tenders and 5 shrimp.  Not a lot of food. If you didn't get seconds on fries, we'd both have left hungry.  To add insult to this I ordered a extra thai special sauce which came in a TINY cup for which they charged me 75 cents. OK, I can see charging for extra sauce, but then they didn't bring the 2 sauces the dish was supposed to come with.  Spouse's burger was ok, but wasn't all that on the juicy factory, bacon seemed very skimpy compared to the picture with 4 big slices, and the bun was not a soft fresh buttery kaiser, some sort of hard roll was given instead. Not really nailing it, but the cheese was real and nicely melted. The prices on beers were reasonable, to their credit, but were not a special deal or especially cheap at all either. At 2.99 soda was a little high but all chain restaurants are getting up there like that.  Our server was kind and attentive, but she was less experienced. The more senior and experienced staff basically ignored her and us. The manager was a good guy and asked us about out meal but we didn't know what to say other than. ""It's fine"" but in reality I wanted to say ""You're charging me 14 dollars and a pointless upcharge for an entree that is tiny.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-camillus
Rebecca G.,"Syracuse, NY",19,79,98,3.0,4/15/2017,"I really enjoyed my burger. I would definitely go back for another burger. I got a side salad - eh..okay- nothing special. The waitress was great - friendly & attentive. They got my sister-in-law's order wrong twice. The weird thing is you would hope they would compensate for the wrong order twice in some way (e.g. free beverage, coupon for next time, take a percentage off the order) but alas, nothing was done to make-up for their errors.  Too bad. Outstanding customer service would make a big difference in this review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-camillus
Hector S.,"Liverpool, NY",0,3,3,1.0,10/15/2017,Horrible customer service and long wait on getting serve. We are a family of 7 and I couldn't believe the service for a well recognized family oriented restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-camillus
Lindsey S.,"De Witt, NY",0,1,,1.0,8/9/2017,"Went for a burger last night. I usually enjoy this restaurant (other locations) but will never return to the Camillus location. I got the Black and Bleu burger. It came out with cheese, one or two BURNT mushrooms and a couple strings of sautéed onions. I am not a complainer, but I was going to be paying $15 for this thing! The toppings were piled into a little tiny section of the burger. The fries came out COLD and soggy. I couldn't believe they were serving food like this!  I asked for a new one, which they were more than willing to take care of having seen my plate. When it came out, it wasn't much better, and nearly inedible. I ate two bites and left the rest. It was so dry and tasteless and definitely didn't deserve the $15 price tag. My family's burgers weren't much better. Overdone with some toppings. Soggy fries. You should be able to expect a big juicy burger at Red Robin but what we got was dry and tasteless.  I do have to say, the service was great. We were taken care of by the manager and had a wonderful server. They were kind and generous to us and understood our complaints. Too bad they have to serve such terrible food.  Get a burger next door at Longhorn!!! Don't go here!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-camillus
Kristin S.,"Syracuse, NY",0,6,,2.0,4/15/2017,"My teenage son loves this place. My teenage son also loves kraft macaroni and cheese and corn dogs, so he is not the most reliable recommender.  Ordered the Caesar salad with the dressing on the side. It came with the dressing on it and my husband asked that it be remade knowing that I would not eat it but I would not send it back either. I don't send my food back because of the fear of retribution for having to do double work. I am sure it is irrational.  About 10 minutes later the salad arrived. After eating about a third of it there was the hair. At that point I was not sending it back or eating it for that matter. Bummer. $10 for that.  I am sure their food is good judging by watching my table mates eat their food. (Hence the second star.) For me, I will let the teenagers keep this place. Sorry RR.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-camillus
Andy C.,"Camillus, NY",26,4,,1.0,9/13/2017,"Let me start off by saying we went to the bar to order some to go food being three burgers in a wedge salad no problem to begin with and 45 minutes later and people who set their 20 minutes after us got their food and their appetizers and we're still sitting here waiting for our three burgers and wedge salad at the one-hour Mark I said I want my money back this is ridiculous there was no apology from the manager Matt very rude and all the employees mainly The Waitresses seem to be like they were at a sleepover and it was a party in the back because I seen with my own eyes them taking pictures of other waitresses biting each other's butts corporate should know about this cuz this is ridiculous it seemed to be that they were more into having a party in the back the next Lee taking care of the customers and there were no customers in the building when we got there so they were not busy , and the manager Matt talks to the female employees you should be ashamed of yourself. Then they couldn't find my receipt they couldn't find what I ordered they couldn't even know how much to her fund me because they do not have their act together at this location and I love Red Robin Burgers but I will never go back to that Management in management staff there are a joke and make Red Robin gourmet burgers look like a joke I hope this gets to corporate save time and money and just go to Burger King or McDonald's you won't waste all of your Friday night to get nothing",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-camillus
Connor M.,"Auburn, NY",0,1,,3.0,10/1/2017,"Food was great, fries came out cold the first time. Waitress Victoria was most definitely the worst I have ever encountered.

Jessica S.,"Mystic, CT",1,13,1,5.0,10/4/2016,"Not only was the soup cold and salad made with the ""core"" part of iceberg lettuce, but I suffered a bad fall in the restroom.  I am disabled, and this restroom area was a nightmare.  Since it was impossible to negotiate with my scooter, I was forced to abandon it, and ended up falling.  No serious injuries, but I was mortified.  A manager came out and did an accident report...She did not even comp. the lousy meal.   Update:  Customer service is wonderful.  This issue has been dealt with at the corporate level. Update:  12/22- Redemption!  Burgers and fries were delicious, hot, and quick.  Even had a glass of cab to compliment my burger.  No accessibility complaints, here-- even on a winter night in Syracuse!  Cheers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-camillus

Drink refills (good luck).  We ask for a small sample of chili (which was great) and we wanted it first as an appetizer, they brought it at the end.

Everyone else got their food and then when my burger arrived it was so overdone it was dry like sawdust. (I asked for pink inside) How can you be a burger place and mess up a burger.

Pa E.,"Napanee, Canada",0,55,,1.0,10/17/2016,The waitress hyped up the quality of the food when we ordered. The waitress said their smaller burgers are always well done. I ordered a regular burger meal and clearly asked for it to be well done. The burger arrived pink raw.

Ordered chips and salsa took 20 minutes before they arrived. Restaurant was not busy at the time. We ordered simple burgers, neither order was correct. It was as though it was food for another table. Fries were ice cold. Only thing that was good was the ice water.  ** I will say their customer service was on point.

April S.,"Syracuse, NY",8,44,2,4.0,10/25/2015,We went today to check out the new red robin.   Our server Michelle was very friendly and efficient.   She was on top of everything and it was the best service we've had in a long time.   There was just two of us so there wasn't any wait which was great because it was very busy.   My husband got the bonsai burger and I got the western bbq burger.   Both were cooked to perfection and very tasty.   We also order the Jalapeño rings and zucchini sticks both were fresh and prepared in the restaurant not frozen like most places.   Our only complaint was the zucchini sticks were more spears than sticks.   They were very interesting to eat and required a fork and knife.   After reading the other reviews I was quite shocked that it was so good.   We will definitely be back to try the other burgers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-camillus?start=20

I stated I would wait longer for that person. I was happy when the expected wait time of 30 minutes ended up being 6 minutes. I was then told to wait one minute while the table was cleaned. 10 minutes later the table was ready for us. Despite checking in with two people I was brought to a table with one chair. Once that was remedied we waited an additional 10+ minutes to be asked what we wanted to drink. I'm pretty sure the server (who was NOT) the person I specifically requested only came by the table because she saw up getting up to leave.

Dj D.,"Syracuse, NY",0,6,,1.0,10/14/2015,"This is NOT your typical Red Robin...  This is a very small restaurant compaired to the one in Fayetteville.  The service is lackluster at best.

The whole time we were there,  a staff member kept walking around the dining room with an iPad just looking at everything, over and over and over...  She may have been making sure things were ok but it was a very uncomfortable feeling.  She never talked to any customers, just to the wait staff.  The bar is very small. The server had an attitude.The food was ok.  They give you about 5 fries with the burgers even though they say unlimited fries.  And when saying something about it, the said she'd put in an order...  AN ORDER....  You mean they make fries for every burger... ??  Not a mass of them at once..  Well they came out just as we were finishing up, and when she said an ""order""  that what we got,  1 order for 5 people.
