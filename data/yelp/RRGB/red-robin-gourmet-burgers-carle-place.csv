Jonny L.,"Queens, NY",178,5,,3.0,1/13/2018,"I used to come here quite a bit with family and some friends. It was better then than it is now. The people working in the back are obnoxious and shouting at each other, causing the people who are sitting at the tables near the kitchen to be disrupted and uncomfortable.  (I sat at table 78) I was sitting and listening to one of them shout ""SHUT UP"" loud enough for a good portion of the restaurant to hear. There were about 5 tables that were not cleaned as I walked in, and it seemed as if it was like that for awhile. Some positives were the fast service and delicious food. The server we had was a friendly and efficient employee; he was one of the two people who asked if I was being helped. I understand it was a high time, but I waited about 15 minutes up front without being asked if I was being helped or needed help. I thought there was supposed to be someone at the front who helps incoming customers and to let them know if there was a table available and/or if there was a wait time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place
Derek S.,"Williston Park, NY",309,36,177,4.0,11/12/2017,"Stopped here earlier today for lunch! Was craving a burger and I knew Reb Robin would satisfy my hunger!  Started out with both a Very berry raspberry limeade and a Tropical Mai Tai. I always love the limeade so no issues there, the tropical mai tai wasn't bad. But it wasn't great either in my opinion. I just think they could've evened out the ratio of rum to sweetness a little better!  For an appetizer, I got the Jump starter double with jalapeño coins and mozzarella sticks! Delicious! The jalapeño coins are perfectly fried and the mozzarella sticks are nice and crispy, with a melty inside! I also got the pretzels which I have to say were amazing! Soft, not soggy and the cheese sauce was great! It also has a slight kick to it which I love!  Next, I got the Prime chophouse burger medium! When I received the burger, it was more on the well done side but it still was a good burger! Also, the bottomless fries are the best! Those fries are so addicting! The seasoning is also crazy good! Although it's not good for me, I dump it on the fries! No regrets!  Overall, I had a nice lunch today! Parking is a lot with plenty of spaces! Service was quick, staff were very friendly, and I have to say, they are very attentive! At least, in my experience!

Leilani E.,"Franklin Square, NY",2,11,4,3.0,8/17/2017,Was a bit skeptical at first because of some bad reviews here. But totally glad now that we've finally tried it. Our server Eric was helpful and attentive. The burgers were medium rare as requested. The onion rings and dipping sauces were bomb. There was a huge refill of fries for the kids meal. My son ate all 6 pcs of the meatballs. And they even gave him 2 red balloons on our way out (which he loves!). Overall a good experience and we'll be back again for sure. Update: went back recently and sad to say the experience wasn't a good one. Food took a looong time to come out and I think they were short staffed so our server looked unhappy and inattentive. Not planning to come back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place
Cortney W.,"Brooklyn, NY",534,366,1044,3.0,8/17/2017,"Red Robin, yum! Cmon I know you wanted to start a review of Red Robin like that.  I stopped in for a quick dinner with my cousin. The hostess was very nice and found us a table quickly. I noted very quickly that many servers were sitting at a table chatting. I was a little put off by that because despite the fact that it wasn't super busy I didn't think it was appropriate to be hanging out at a table near people who were dining.  The server came over and took our drink orders while we looked over the menu. We both got happy hour drinks and she disappeared for a good 10-15 minutes. She didn't come back to check if we were ready to order. She eventually came back with the drinks and took our orders. The food came relatively quickly and hot. The burgers were very good and came with bottomless fries. The initial serving of fries that came with the burger was the size of what might come with a kids meal. It seemed like it was overlooked as the plate was put together. We had to flag down the server to get an additional serving.  Once we finished our meal we found out that we could pay through the computerized screen on the table. That was easy enough. I would try Red Robin again because the food was good. Service could use some improvement.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place
Cat D.,"New York, NY",123,279,1538,1.0,4/25/2017,"This was my first time here. We had to go to Barnes and Noble but was so hungry and didn't want to go far so we came here.  They sat us by the bar at a high table...I'm not fussy, so whatever. The service was BAD. Everything was fine when we got sat and given menus. But the waitress/bartender asked us if we'd been there before-- we said no...then she explained the menu and offered us beverages. Okay, fine. But why did we get our waters 20 minute later?   Whatever, we forgot about it...now we are ready to order. She took our orders and this is where it just gets bad. We waited about 30+ minutes for our food. He ordered a medium burger and I have the 4 cheese grilled cheese.  We played virtual games on the table kiosk for 30 minutes or so...Our waters were done for a while, too. I'm starting to get antsy and upset. I told my BF to go to The bookstore before they close because he could have gone there and back and the food still wouldn't have come.  Just to play it safe, he didn't leave. The waitress comes and tells us that our food is on it's way out. We wait an additional 10 minutes. We finally get our food. Low and behold...my food was COLD. It was so cold that the bread had hardened. I tried to eat it because I was just so hungry. The bread was so hard it scraped my pallet. I just ate all the fries. The burger can be compared to a Burger King burger. We just wanted to get the heck out of there. Also, the stuff on the bottomless menu...is a JOKE. As soon as she put the broccoli down, it was gone in 2 seconds because there were only 4 in the bowl.   Like what the ACTUAL f*ck?!  She didn't come back until 20 minutes later when he was done with his sub par burger!  She gave him another 5 broccli!  I was so mad, I pressed the ""call a waitress"" button on the kiosk. She never came!  I had NO patience and thankfully, I remembered that you can pay through the kiosk. I paid and gave the lowest tip possible...15%. She didn't deserve that tip. I wasn't going to leave anything.  We just got up and left. What's worse...both of us ended up feeling sick after that meal. I'm NEVER going back there. I don't know how anyone goes there regularly. Nothing is ""yummmmm"" about that place. You're better off going to Wendy's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place
Deborah M.,"Yulee, FL",956,462,3371,2.0,7/31/2017,"How hard is it to mess up a burger and some onion rings???? Well it must be pretty hard. Onion rings tasted like the oil they were fried in was old, thus the weird after taste and almost metallic taste. Not enough ketchup or barbecue sauce in the world to cover that taste not alone the possibility of bathroom Olympics later in the evening if you keep eating them. I had the manager take them away. Yucky the opposite of Yummy. Hello No. Hamburger - I don't know, good gosh, seriously, ewww.  Do they have frozen burgers at Red Robin??? Probably. Do you see me rolling my eyes. G said his was tolerable.  Maybe I was just being Pamela Picky Pants or something but the whole thing was just nasty. I gave 2 stars because G ate his and I took the French fries home to the birds. Side note, the French fries were soggy and cold.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place
Josh G.,"New Hyde Park, NY",242,458,4165,4.0,11/5/2016,"Okay, I promise not to reference the catchy jingle of this place even though it's fun to quote. But a restaurant should be much more than a little slogan. It needs to have good grub as well. Red Robin isn't anything close to grand (especially in the wide world of burgers), but last night's dinner was worthy of 3.5 stars (and a round up to four knowing I'll return).  The place used be a little too kitschy and almost childish, but more recently they've given themselves a facelift to portray a bit more of a contemporary adult vibe. There's still plenty of fun decor including burger-themed seats by the front entrance and a mural of colored baseballs creating a replica of the American Flag. They've also tried to put some focus on beer, which, in this growing craft brew world, is a smart move. Though this smart move is a bit more like a nice gesture as their craft beer listings aren't too vast. We'll chalk it up to a work-in-progress. Beyond drink, there's a decent selection of apps to start your meal with. We went for the onion ring tower. Clever in presentation and decent in taste with a few sauces for dipping accompanied on the side. The real reason you're probably coming is for the plethora of burger options RR serves up. I'll give them some serious credit in having a wide array of styles, toppings, and creative limited edition burgers on hand. That being said, the meat quality isn't anything mouthwatering. Their vaguely cooked-to-order (some pink or no pink) which is another nice gesture, though I'd prefer slight more attention to detail in the meat than having so many  topping options. But, when in Red Robin, do as the menu orders and get a burger loaded with goodies. Personal favorite (and choice last night) is the Burnin' Love burger (fried jalapeños, salsa, pepper-jack, lettuce, tomatoes and chipotle aioli on a jalapeño-cornmeal bun). Everything works well together to create some quality heat and fresh flavor.  Overall, Red Robin tries hard to reach a level of burger that other places reach with much more ease. They may not have the greatest beef, but they'll concoct a burger with a wonderful assortment of toppings. I'll return for that aspect and hopefully (with a little work) some beer as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place
Subashis P.,"Mineola, NY",143,103,148,2.0,9/20/2017,"Ehhh....i only came to this place because of the commercials. Decided to check them out. The waitress really didnt care, and just took out order and left. We got their bacon cheeseburger. It wasn't anything spectacular. The burger meat itself tastes like a frozen patty. The fries tasted kinda old. I would give this place another shot if the waitress and service were better or even average. Definitely better to go to another fast food spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place
Kristin Z.,"Freeport, NY",26,115,11,2.0,3/25/2017,"Mmmm No. TL; DR- I'm sure there are better burger places.   Went in 3p on a Saturday, party of four and had a short wait.  The cute  kids' chalk games in the lobby were worthless without the chalk.  Asked for chalk,  it never came.  Here's the biggest problem here- there's no organization when it comes to waitstaff.  Nobody knows who has what table,  and that leads to tables being ignored (took awhile to get a server) and food was taken to the wrong table  (us) and others (i paid attention).   The bright star of the evening was our server,  Jimmy.  Hustling,  cheery young kid who did his job exceptionally well despite the chaos.   The food was disappointing.   Picky Pete got the smoked pepper burger. Bacon was thin and the burger wasn't seasoned.  This came in handy though because Picky Pete, Jr. ate half because her fried cod was not crispy at all and she deemed it inedible.  Decent flavor but the coating was practically steamed.   Teen is a great eater and demolished her bacon cheddar burger, minus the bacon because they forgot it.  My Burnin Love burger was a huge miss.  It was flavorless, overloaded with mealy mushy tomatoes, and it just wasn't good. I had also asked for a side of their pickled  jalapenos but didn't receive them.   The fries all around are mushy, limp and pale.  My garlic herb fries tasted like feet and no fries,  on any plate,  were hot. Despite what looked like cool options,  we skipped on dessert. Ambience is super cute, but with an open kitchen and burger centric menu, the dining area is loud with kids and kitchen noise. Wee one said,  ""This reminds me of Chuck E Cheese.""  I don't disagree. ..there just aren't any cool games to distract you from the subpar food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place

Janine K.,"East Elmhurst, NY",221,117,1156,4.0,7/1/2017,"Despite the bad reviews that my boyfriend and I had read prior to arriving, we still decided to give it a try and we are glad that we did. Surprisingly for a Friday night they were not busy at all and we were seated in a booth immediately. A sweet girl named Alana who ended up being our waitress and took our drink order. In the menu the domestic beers are advertised as $4.50 but when we ordered, Alana informed us that they're actually $5.50 which is no biggie but I am giving a 4 star rating because of that because they should update their menu prices. The drinks came out fairly quick and to our surprise they were served in huge glasses. The $5.50 was definitely worth it and no additional beverages were needed due to that. Red Robin's also has a cool kiosk system which for $1.99, we played unlimited games on (Trivia) and were able to make orders off of as well as pay.  There were so many burgers that I wanted to try but unfortunately I could only chose one so I went with the Buzz Mac & Cheese burger from the Tavern Menu and I opted for the signature patty rather than the double patty. For an additional $1.49, I was able to substitute regular fries for sweet potato fries. The burger patty was a decent size with a generous serving of mac & cheese, pepper jack cheese, lettuce and tomato on it. There was a ranch sauce that was on the burger which I could've done without but it was still very tasty. The bun was not soggy at all as I read in other reviews and the patty was  cooked just how I had ordered it. Although there were many things on the burger, you were still able to taste it all and everything meshed well together. My boyfriend ordered the Siracha Tavern burger which it looked like he enjoyed and was very well stacked with condiments, I almost regretted not ordering it. Once we were done eating, Alana came to check on us and then back again with the check. She was very on top of us without being annoying like most places trying to rush the customers out.  I'm happy that we decided to venture out to Long Island to try these burgers and will definitely be returning to try the rest. This location is ideal because it is steps away from all of the shopping centers on Old Country Road and offers parking. What's better than shopping and a good meal?!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place

This is where Stop + Shop comes in play. The ""carved turkey breast"" was deli turkey with 2 strips of bacon on the most bread like croissant I have ever had.

We were a group of 8 so the wait was about 20 minutes , not too bad .  When we were seated our waiter came over to us in about 5 mins . He took our drink order first and I asked for water with lemon , I was the first one to place my drink order . He brought only 6 drinks and gave us 4 straws , and we're 8 people . Told him he's missing a few glasses , he comes back with 2 more and non of them had lemon.  I asked about 4 times to bring me lemon before he finally remembered , and by then I was pretty much done with my glass of water . He took our orders and we put in for another order of their bottomless fires because that takes forever to come to the table.  He came to the table and asked if we needed any refills on drinks , I said yes so he took my glass away . Came back with the same glass and the old lemon still in the cup . Took 3 times to ask for chocolate milk for my son , and when everyone at my table needed refills on drinks , he took all our glasses and used the same ones !  He returned to the table and started handing out glasses , how do you know who's is who's ??

I wish the gourmet burgers offered more toppings and options. So far my favorite have been the Bacon Guacamole & Burning Love. The patties are large and chargrilled. The service is fast and everybody comes for the BOTTOM LESS FRIES. I would recommend getting the Sweet Potato instead of steak cut for an additional $1. They are delicious when hot.

The burger was cooked exactly as I ordered it, the pickle relish on the burger is delicious !  Our waitress was wonderful tonight! I wish I could remember her name! She was attentive, cheery, and checked up on us multiple times.  We ended up getting a free burger with our rewards card (buy 9 burgers get 1 free!). We didn't even know we were up to that amount until our waitress was sure to have us log into our rewards account.  I'm not sure why there are so many low reviews about the service here but I have never had an issue at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=20
Grace T.,"Garden City, NY",127,40,37,4.0,7/25/2017,"I've been here a few times and I've always been greeted and seated right away. However, this time we waited a minute or two at the empty hostess podium. Then finally a young girl came up to us looking like she was scared or confused?  With that facial expression that was not exactly welcoming, she asked ""Can I help you?"" And we were like ""um table for two?"" Not sure if she was new or something but it was a kind of weird, awkward interaction. She  seemed to disappear again and the poor people who came in after us just started seating themselves. One thing I like about Red Robin's burgers is that they don't look like they are basic frozen patties that a lot of restaurants use. I also like my burgers medium rare and I was a little disappointed that it was more like well done. But that's not the end of the world. All the ingredients together tasted  really fresh. I also love that Red Robin has gluten free burger buns! I have always been quite the  burger connoisseur, but it is much harder now having a gluten intolerance. I am grateful for any place that either has a GF Bun option or a lettuce wrap, which Red Robin has both! My boyfriend is diabetic and can't do a lot of carbs so the lettuce wrap is great for him. Our server was super laid back and got our food out pretty fast. The manager as well was extremely courteous and came and checked on us a few times to make sure everything was satisfactory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=20
Andy B.,"Malverne, NY",6,23,,2.0,11/15/2017,"Was in the area thought I would give it a go for the first time. It was a Monday early evening and the place was empty.  I decided to sit at the bar which looks quite nice.  Started off with a cold Lite Beer - good start,   Was not really in the mood for a burger so I gave the $10 Nachos a try.  Wait time seemed a bit long, like 15 minutes, considering the place was virtually empty.   Had the distinct feeling that food may be purposely delayed until you have finished your first drink guaranteeing you will order another.   In any event, when the Nachos did arrive they looked a bit sparse.  It appeared as if the chips had been preloaded with a meat mixture and melted cheese and then the other ingredients  placed on the dish once ordered. I assume this since both the meat and cheese were cold and looked dried out from preheating. Two scoops of guacamole & sour cream topped the dish with a few little cups of other ingredients (salsa & hot peppers) that you add yourself.  Once the dish was assembled it was TASTELESS.  Totally bland.  I asked the bartender if she had some hot sauce and she handed me a bottle tabasco sauce from the bar.  Guess I should have opted for the burger but I will never know since I will not be returning anytime soon.   Suggestion: Take your $10, go to Taco Bell, order 2 Nachos Bel Grandes add their ""Fire Sauce"" and enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=20

She took my order, then disappeared, someone else brought out our drinks, someone else brought out out appetizer, then here comes our waitress, she dropped the order and our table was missing the bottle of ketchup and I asked her for a bottle, instead of her getting the ketchup, she started waiting on others customers, so after awhile, I went to a empty table and grabbed a bottle. On to the food, My oldest son ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with a fruit cup, my little guy wanted a cheese burger and apple slices, I went with the 7.99 burger special ( the website says 6.99) but the waitress advised me that NY doesn't honor the web price, oh well, is what it is,  Now we have our food and my little guy digs into his apple slices and the look in his face was of sheer terror, he tells me it tastes nasty, so I thought my son, being my son was just being a pain in the ass, so I tried it and spat it half way across the restaurant, nasty is a kind word for it, looking for our waitress...again, no where to be seen, so I guess it was the manager came by and I showed him the package of apples, he comped the kids order which was very cool of him, as for my burger, the bun was meh, the lettuce and tomato was soggy, so I ditched that stuff and ate the meat, which was pretty good, the poof, our waitress pops up from her hiding spot, now she's telling me how to order off the kiosk, I look at her and tell her, all I want is a shake and the bill, she insists I order off the kiosk, I'm like WTF! So I place my order, and pay my bill, but instead of paying by CC, I insist on paying cash, just to be a asshole, she brings me my change, and poof, gone again, we'll, I guess she didn't want a tip, so I handed $5.00 to the manager and told him that he did a better job than her.

Doug W.,"Patchogue, NY",369,809,3184,3.0,12/1/2015,"For a chain restaurant my experience was a good one, I like their seasoning and they've got it table side to smother your fries in, make a mayo sauce with, and add extra to the burger of your choice. The messier the better I always say, so what if it's a bit all over the place and difficult to eat, it tastes good! If it tastes good I keep eating no matter how wet and messy it gets. I've got a beard to soak up the flavor ya know- bring it on  I give Robin 4 stars if I'm judging it knowing full well what it is and what it needs to be.   But I probably wouldn't go out of my way for this over a local spot, or even my own home, however maybe I should invest in a batch of their seasoning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=60

The booth that me and my son were seated in was kind of small and at times uncomfortable but considering that seating was limited at the time I just stuck it out. It took a few minutes, but eventually the waiter came to the table to give us our menus. Our food took about 15 -20 minutes. My son got the turkey burger with salad, which he really seemed to enjoy. I got the salmon burger with salad as a side. The salmon burger was good. It was even topped with fried lemon pieces (which doesn't taste as bad as it sounds) and some type of citrus/chipotle sauce. The salad was just an average garden salad; it was great but it wasn't bad either.I also got the low calorie lemonade which was ok.

When she told us she would help request them to expedite our order it actually felt like she did that! We got our steak fries out first within 5 minutes of sitting down and our burgers came out about 5 minutes after that.

Andrew D.,"Brooklyn, NY",34,63,149,4.0,8/11/2015,"So yeah, I've actually stumbled upon a Red Robin!! Yeah, that burger joint with the infectious jingle, yknow? ""Reddd Robbinn -- yumm!!!"" Yeah -- that jingle. Anyhow, now that that's out of my system I can start with my review. Ahem!    So while driving for work, I spotted one and and told myself I just had to go check it out. Upon entry I was greeted at the door and was then asked where I would prefer to sit. Being alone, I naturally opted for the bar. At the bar I was being greeted and serviced by a pleasant gentleman (yes, I forget his name). I proceeded to be the nerd I am and inquire a whole slew of questions regarding the establishment as a whole. Why aren't there more of these around and where is it originally based out of and that sort of thing. He was very nice and knowledgable when replying to all questions which I must say is quite impressive.    Fast forward. I scour the menu and to my surprise, albeit they specialize in burgers, never in my life have I seen such a menu. The menu so extensively dedicated to umpteen varieties of the hamburger. I loved it! Haha! I then become indecisive 'Drew and start asking nor questions even. I told him what I was into and all and we started to meet halfway until I stumbled upon the 'Burnin Love! With a name like that, I expected nothing but a salivating mouth with each bite I took. The 'Burnin Love is a burger topped with jalapeño coins, salsa, pepper-jack, lettuce, tomatoes, and chipotle on a cornmeal kaiser roll. Ironically enough one the menu its description is concluded with a concise, ""it's love at first bite"".    Boy oh boy was it just that! I loved every bite of it! Best of all, I tasted every single ingredient listed. That's cool to say when slot of times you eat something from a restaurant and you don't taste half of the ingredients they say are in the dish (for whatever reason). I loved Red Robbin and the cool act I forgot to mention is that they also offer beer pairings! That's right! Not wine, but beer pairings to go along with the burgers! I'm more of a water with lemon fellow when I go out, but this was certainly cool to know!   Although I've yet to go back to Red Robin, I will when I get the chance again! This is a great place for any real burger lover! Wash one of these bad boys down with a beer and you're on your way to heaven in a bun!

No exaggeration. I don't believe in sending food back to the kitchen, but there was no way we were going to eat those onion rings. So I told the server they were cold, and of course the kitchen re drops the same onion rings. When they come back. They were hot. But now it just taste like old oil. Now my food comes. Chicken sandwich was good, fries were soggy. The fries at Red Robin are bottomless. I wanted more fries, but my server was nowhere to be found.

Melissa C.,"Baldwin, NY",10,35,24,1.0,6/1/2017,"My boyfriend and I came here on a Thursday evening at around 5:15pm. However we ended leaving before even getting a chance to eat the food that we ordered. The restaurant seemed empty and we were seated right away. Not long after that, our waitress came by and introduced herself and took our drink order. I ordered  a diet coke and my boyfriend ordered a strawberry lemonade. The drinks took a little while to come out, which was strange since we didn't order anything special. About ten minutes later, our waitress came back and took our entree order. We sat around waiting for awhile for our food to come out. What was even more odd is that customers who came in after we did got their food and were enjoying their meal, while we waited. Meanwhile our waitress never came back to update us on the status of our food. Maybe another 15-20 minutes goes by and the manager finally comes out and tells us that our food order was served to another customer and they had to remake our food. So we decided to wait, since we were told our food would be out shortly. Another 15 minutes goes by and we still didn't get our meal. I ended up tracking our waitress down to let her know we were leaving and we wanted to cancel our order and also to give us the check for the drinks that we ordered .

I'm not a big fan of bread, and I chose a burger with thick artisan bread. I asked for my burger to be medium. I got medium well.

Also, the wait time for your food to arrive (not the wait staff's fault, as I pointed out in my most recent review) has been reduced drastically. So all in all, a very enjoyable dining experience.

Initially I was skeptical when my wife tried it in the past, but today I took a chance and really enjoyed it! Milkshakes are usually good here also.

The onion rings are some of the best I've had and topped off with their delicious ranch, ugh, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.  So the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the service isn't always great. The servers seem put out that they have to bring more fries or salad or whatever it is you ordered.

Sometimes it is undercooked too much and sometimes it is overcooked to paper. The toppings and combinations of them are what makes thing place amazing.  Royal red robin with an egg and bacon is great. The banzai burger with pineapple and teriyaki sauce is my wife's favorite. A good balance between sweet and savory. The ghost fiery burger (not the tavern burger) is my favorite. It is spicy, but off balanced by the savory of the burger itself. I substitute the jalapeño bun for a ciabatta bun and it gives the hotness of the jalapeños a notch down. The jalapeño coins though are not that spicy to begin with. This place is good.

We had been then waiting thirty minutes till our server came up to the table to tell us that the food would still be a while longer.  She offered to bring out some fries for the table and we gladly accepted as we were starving.  The only problem is that she never did bring out the fries.  The manager was walking around and we called his attention to make him aware of the situation.  At this point we have been in the restaurant for an hour and have not had a bite of food.  I feel the manager was the largest problem in the establishment because he did not do well with customer service.  He was not very understanding and told us the food would be right out and they were putting it on plates, but even then it took a while.  When our food finally arrived, we still did not have any napkins or utensils on the table so we then had to wait for those which also took a long time.  The thing that I was most disappointed in was the fact that the manager never even came over to the table once after the food came out to see how everything was or if we needed anything else.  He was completely out of sight since the first time he came over to us.  The food was not very hot which questioned why it took so long.  I know Red Robin prides themselves in being ""bottomless"" for many things but even to get a refill of fruit which I am pretty sure came out of a can took about 15 minutes.  The food was definitely not worth the price we paid, as there are many amazing burger establishments nearby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=80

Service from the bartender was a little difficult, just because of how slammed he was making drinks, but where he missed the servers waiting for drinks at the service area of the bar made up, filling in and getting us whatever we'd asked for. All in all, I got a lot more than I expected from Red Robin, and I think I'll be back soon (cholesterol be damned).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=140

Yesenia G.,"East Elmhurst, NY",21,49,112,3.0,9/13/2015,"First time at Red Robin was a fun experience with a couple of my girlfriends. Once arriving to the restaurant we were asked if we were all over the age of 21 in which we were, so we were seated upstairs in the bar area. The table was cozy and in a great location to watch baseball games which were playing on multiple flat screens. The ladies and I had a round of drinks and we also took advantage of our free refills and ordered separate drinks on there free refill menu. Our waitress was sweet & really made an effort to help us all with a burger choice. Since they were so many of us I won't go and say what we got individually, so I'll say what I ordered. I had a bbq burger with bacon, cheddar cheese, sweet bbq sauce (which was delicious btw), lettuce and mayo. The burger also comes with caramelized onions, but since I'm not a fan I had them removed. The girls and I were super happy with our orders and very much enjoyed the refills on our soft drinks and fries. Here's the problem, after we received our meal & some refills it was Incredibly difficult to find out waitress. When you arrive, on your table there is this tablet like accessory in which you can order your food, call the waitress from it, order dessert or drinks, even view your check & pay via card. So I'm assuming the waitress excepted us to use the tablet for anything we needed. Maybe I'm old fashion but I like the waitress coming over, just in case I have questions.  Here's when I get upset, once we finally got her to come over I ask her for our check, seriously it took her 23 mins to come back with our check! That's insane. I saw her doing other things which I really don't mind, but I also saw her laughing it up with her coworkers and at a point even looking around like she had forgotten something which in this case was my check. I was so upset, I ended up walking over to her as she was glazing at the stars and said can I please have my check again! She apologized gave me my check and took another 15 minutes to come pick it up from our table. That is the reason why I gave this Red Robin a 3 star review ! I don't mind the tablet you guys use to order or pay the bill but I do mind the lack of importance the waitress gave my party at the end of our dinner. Maybe I'll rethink going to this red robin & I'm sure I speak for the rest of my girls.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=140
Ab W.,"Hewlett, NY",1,131,,2.0,1/3/2016,"Very disappointing. Typical of chains, they have this ridiculous rule that limits their burgers to ""no pink"" or ""some pink.""

Sergio M.,"Levittown, NY",48,30,,3.0,4/2/2015,"Love the food, but service overall brings it down.  I fell in love with the food on my first visit, and have been here to eat for my birthday for 2 years in a row. The atmosphere is fun and lively, the music isn't too loud, wait times are fair, and as long as you can tolerate the just AVERAGE to at times below average service, you will have a nice time.  First off, the food is EXCELLENT. Always fresh, always hot, always nice and tasty. The food quality gets an easy A+.... but now onto the negatives... While the wait-staff is just NICE enough, I have sensed a certain pompous nature with them on almost all of my visits. It's like these young hipster types think they're working at a 5-star Manhattan elite restaurant as opposed to a chain burger joint in the suburbs. I honestly felt like punching one of them in the face during one visit.  Common sense things like having bottomless fries yet not giving customers ketchup at the table occur often. Your waiter will disappear for elongated periods at a time without stopping by to ask how things are or if you need anything (if other restaurants can do this, why can't Red Robin?) And I have this hunch of a feeling that they wait staff is actually trained to **NOT** immediately bring the second helping of the ""bottomless fries"" feature that makes this restaurant so popular. Seriously, your second helping of fries, which are technically free, will have you waiting so long that you'll lose your appetite for them. I'm thinking this is done **PURPOSEFULLY** to psychologically deter people from ordering the second helping of fries so the joint doesn't have to spend as much on them. It only makes sense.  More patient types will enjoy the place better than those who aren't as patient and have less tolerance for annoying pet peeves. So if you are a patient type, go check it out, you'll likely have a nice time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=140

When I finally got connected a bartender, I placed the order and stressed that I have a peanut allergy. He read the order back to me and everything was correct. When I came to pick up the order, I realized why I had to wait so long when I called in. There was one bartender working behind the bar doing EVERYTHING, including serving drinks, answering phones, and running back and forth to the kitchen. They should have one or two people dedicated to manning the phones and taking orders.  When I checked my order upon arriving, the appetizer I ordered was wrong. Instead of giving me sweet potato fries like I asked for, they gave me jalapeno poppers. To make matters worse, when I told the bartender, he said I could keep the poppers and I didn't have to worry because everything was GLUTEN FREE. I said, ""Gluten free?

The atmosphere is perfect if I am lone with my other half or with the entire family.  The longest I have ever waited for a table was about 45 minutes and this was in the peak of the sumer on a saturday night around 7pm. If you have kids they are kid friendly. They have ballons for the kids which is very nice.  I actually come here rather than Shake shack nearbye since it is a kid friendlier place in IMO. They have booster seats and high chairs available.  THey have a full bar if you are looking to have a drink with your meal. The bar section is away from the main dining area but, it is in view of the entire restaurant. Recently they added some craft beers to the menu such a Smutttynose all day IPA.  I have only had several of there delicieous burgers and appetizers never any of there other dishes.

Jamlen F.,"Long Island, NY",68,152,29,2.0,11/11/2015,"This is just a review for their burgers. Their red robin burgers have thin patties, but you can add an extra patty for less than $2. Even other chains such as Applebees and Unos have thicker patties. They did cook a 'medium' burger right. The flavor is OK - not impressed, but it doesn't have me running back there. The plus is the touch pad they have on every table - you can place an order and/or pay your check without having to flag down a server.  The bottomless fries are a treat. Although they come unsalted (salt them yourself), the fries are warm with a good crisp, which makes them addicting. Grand Lux is across the street and their burgers are much better.

As appetizer we had wings and kettle chips.  Wings were okay but the chips sucked.  They were cold and tasted funny.  We told the server and new chips were brought out again.  It was still cold and wet.  We also got the clam strip platter which was okay.  I should have just had the clams b/c the burger was a mess.   The waitress seemed overwhelmed and did not check up on us.  We went on a Sunday at 6 30- 8:00.  My sis said b/c of this experience she never wants to go back.  She stated that Shake Shack would have been much better.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=120

The second time came, I finally got to order the sandwich I wanted and it was really tasty! I love the combination of guacamole, bacon, tomatoes, and juicy grilled chicken all between two pieces of toasted bread.  My chicken came out a little charred because of the score marks but it didn't affect the flavor of the entire dish. On the other hand, my friend C*'s burger was inedible! Her Guacamole Bacon burger was burnt around the edges. The staff were quick to resolve the issue and her second one came out perfectly! ;)  I ordered a side of sweet potato fries (yum!!) which were quite large and flavorful, The chipotle sauce I dipped it in was like crack.

The burger was delicious and cooked to perfection. The fries were seasoned very well, and came with extra seasoning if we wanted to put on more. Highly recommend this place! The service could have been better. We were never offered a refill for our drinks and fries, and since the restaurant was busy it felt like they were trying to get us to leave as soon as possible. They gave us our checks RIGHT after we finished our food. I understand it was busy, but we should have been served better.  I received a red royalty card which gives me the option to purchase a appetizer, FOR FREE! That was pretty convenient.

CHEVON M.,"Freeport, NY",10,39,106,1.0,9/24/2011,"I've been looking forward to trying Red Robin for quite a while. I always see the commercials but up until a short while ago, there were none even remotely close by. The hubby and I decided to finally give it a try, though I was truly in the mood for something from Cheesecake Factory. First thing upon arrival, its bright as hell in there, even Dave & Busters has better ambiance than this place! We were seated promptly and given our menus....it was about 11pm at this point and I believe they close at 12. Our waitress must have asked us 5 times if were ready to order, obviously she was ready to close up.  Finally, I ordered the spinach & aritchoke dip, red robin royal burger, and my other half the bleu cheese burger. We waited about a half an hour and our burgers arrived..did you notice I said my burgers arrived. What happened to our appetizer??!?!! She kindly explains to us that the chefs been having problems ""defrosting"" the spinach dip tonight...I asked her to scratch that off the bill. Its not that I was actually expecting it to be made in house, but, damn, I hoped for a tad better. I was kinda turned off at this point.  My so called ""bottomless"" fries totaled to about 12 fries in total and they were far from piping hot! Luke warm at best. We were never offered another round of fries. The burger was ok, but, you can tell its the generic frozen patties, totally unseasoned and uneventful. His bleu cheese burger was decent but once again the patty made it mediocre. My bill came...$40.11! WTF...for two burgers, one beer and a lemonade! Yeah, right! Come to find out she charged us for two desserts we never ordered. After that burger, the last thing I wanted was to waste any more money on their just above fast food level grub!!! My experience there was far from memorable and they'll definitely be a last choice for burgers. I had to remedy this bullsh*t dinner I had tonight...ordered two macaroni cheese ball appetizers, chocolate cake and banana cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory!

She badgered us for orders without giving us time to peruse the menu. Once we decided she was no where to be found and we had to call her over. She bought drinks, nothing else. We had to ask for cutlery as the table wasn't even set. She brought dirty and stained cutlery and dropped it in a pile on the table's end. She should be fired. The restaurant, if that's what it calls itself, should be shuttered. This was a total disaster that really upset our day and the schedule we'd set. We never saw a manager.

However, before placing our order, our server made a huge deal about the bottemless beverages and fries. Great. I ordered a Stella and my husband ordered an ice tea. We must have been waiting 10-15 minutes just for our drinks. SERIOUSLY? I understand if the place is popping and it's so busy. It was an average night. Ok. Fine. By the time we finished our meal it was about 30 minutes later from the time we got our burgers. Needless to say our server came and checked on us 1 time. She was so busy catering to the table next to us to us, it seemed that she completely forgot about us. A huge party of 12 came in and then she dedicated her time with them. Long story short, we never got a refill on the ice tea or fries and when we finally got her attention we just paid the bill and left without ordering anything else. I am a former waitress and I know that they rely on their tips. I tipped her below 20%.

This place is either sadly empty, or going through an unexpected rush.  I feel like they don't know how to staff adequately.  But seriously, I found everyone to be friendly and helpful.   Managers are all cool, particularly Kathie, who wasn't afraid to ensure we remained RR customers after a bad experience.

Second attempt worked out well, and we were seated after a 45 minute wait and a little bit of confusion between waitresses. The table and seats were wet from cleaning, and we had to ask our waitress to wipe the water out for us. Well, acceptable! A tower of onion rings and riblets were great. Especially the riblets should be an entree. SOOO GOOODD!!(left found that there is an entree of riblets. lol) I had Bleu Ribbon Burger which was AWESOME! Freckle Lemonade made of water melon was great too. This was a success and I gave it 5 stars! HOWEVER! My 2nd visit wasn't that pleasant. The wait was decent, but the waiter seemed to got drunk or tipsy somehow. We received utensils after we got our food and asked the waiter. The portion of riblets was not the same, and the burger was TOO SALTY. Fried onions in my burger was just too salty I thought someone dropped salt bottle cover and poured salt accidentally.

Dion R.,"Kings Park, NY",10,41,21,2.0,12/9/2011,"I've been to Red Robin many times when I find myself in New Jersey.  I've always liked the restaurant as I am a burger and fries type of guy, and they have a nice menu insofar as that goes.   I was quite happy to find out one was opening up about a mile or so from where I work.  It took some time, but I was finally able to eat there.   My wife and I were greeted as soon as we entered the establishment and we were seated right away.  We arrived a little after 5pm so I though the place would be somewhat busy, but if there were more than 10 people there, it was a lot.   Our waitress took our order quickly, and we received our appetizer (Mozzarella Sticks) quite quickly.  So far so good.   My wife ordered the A1 burger, as rare as permitted, and I ordered a straight, no frills cheeseburger, well-done.   When the burgers arrived, my wife was satisfied with her burger.  No problems there.  When i bit into mine, the burger was still very pink and in no way looked like a well-done burger.  I called the waitress over and she too agreed that the burger was not cooked as I had requested it and she would have a replacement burger to me in ""3 minutes or so."" Lets just say this.  By the time I received my well-done burger, my wife was finished with her dinner.  Not quite 3 minutes.  More like 15-20.  Now under normal circumstances it might be understandable if the place were packed and very busy.  But in this case the place was quite empty.  I would have liked to eat with my wife, but sadly this was not the case.   The food itself was what I've come to expect from Red Robin, but the place still needs to work on the delivery of it's food and meeting the customers request to have it a certain way.

Ja L.,"JAMAICA, NY",0,32,2,4.0,7/8/2013,"We went to Red Robin for the first time - anywhere or ever. Afterward, I came to Yelp to read the reviews, and was really surprised at all the criticism. We had a great experience - we loved our burgers and the fries were great. We each tried one of their specialty drinks (I had a freckled lemonade and my companion had a smoothie). It was a hot day, so it was doubly nice that the moment I was sucking down the last of the strawberry slices in my drink my waitress was walking toward me with a refill. The staff was really friendly and pleasant (although one of the hostesses was a bit overly chatty, but she was sweet and kind, so it almost didn't matter). Now. Onto the point of Red Robin - the burgers. We were extremely pleased with our burgers and really appreciated the ooey-gooey quality - hot, juicy, just enough fat to melt all over the place but not so much to be disgusting, and the cheese was melted to a state where it was soft and gooey and melted right into the meat. Other burger joints often either under-melt the cheese or toast it to the point where it's more like the cheesy crust on a French onion soup than a topping for a burger. The burgers are different at Red Robin, so I don't find comparisons to places like Five Guys or Jackson Hole to be quite fair. RR had the hot-ooey-gooey factor, but other places do better with the lean sort of ground beef and grill flavor. The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the menu has items on it that make it seem like RR is dependent on brand name foods/drinks that are processed somewhere else rather than being made in the restaurant and by its staff.

Nooooopppppe, the appetizers came first, then a little while later, the water,  the worst part is they did not give us silverware at all, just a bunch of napkins, I tried flagging down the waitress but she's no where to be seen, so we ate our appetizers like barbarians.  When they came with the entrees, then we finally managed to get her attention and bring us some forms!   So during our meal, the waitress came and told us that she's going on break now, and the other girl Angela will take over our table.  We have no idea which girl is Angela, and by then we need refills on our water, so we waited and waited, finished our entrée without water, finally Angela shows up and asked if we needed anything?  We asked for refills on the water, she said sure and walked away.  Then another 15 minutes went by and no water, the whole time I was looking around for her to see if I can grab her attention, because I know for sure she forgot about our water!  Then I saw her come our way and I was like yes here is my chance to remind her about the water!! but no oh no, she went to the booth right behind us and started taking their orders, and chit chatting with them, asking for their names. then after that, she walked away really fast.  I had missed my slim window of opportunity!!  Then another 15 minutes went by, and all 4 of us were sitting there quietly protesting and we had lined up our empty glass by the edge of the table so maybe just maybe she sees it and remember!  So after waiting what it seemed like an eternity, Angela showed up with some water! hurray, ""gulp gulp gulp"" Long story short, took another 15 or so minutes to flag her to give us a check, which she never did, because by then our first waitress came back and ask if everything's okay and we asked her for the check and she delivered pretty fast.   Overall, slow slow slow service, I wouldn't be coming back here.  The food tasted average, I wouldn't spend 80 bucks plus tips to come to this dump ever.  On the way home, both my husband and I had to rush to the bathroom, so I'm not sure if it's due to their food, but most likely it was, because the other meal we had that day was at early morning before we head out to Tangers Riverhead from Queens.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=260
Olivia L.,"Forest Hills, NY",121,83,22,2.0,8/6/2011,"The food here is okay - service is a whole other story. Been here twice - and both times the servers were really friendly and very nice. Unfortunately, this does not mean that they provide any service other than take your orders and bring you your food.  There are no napkins, knives or forks until you ask for it. You can be sitting there with your food and no one will notice that you have nothing to eat it with until you ASK. (i've only been there twice so maybe its a coincidence....but I doubt it.) Their ""bottomless"" fries are a joke. First time, we asked for more fries and waited so long, we just left. Second time, we asked for more fries and it took twice as long as it did to get our food.  We started wondering if this is a scam....and then the waitress comes over to mention that they are still working on my fries (really, how long does it take to cook ? .....) - and that it looks like we are all ready to go, so she can pack it in a box for us. I said ""uh...ok"". 10 minutes after that, she drops a basket of fries on our table. What ??  The other strange thing was that we were already done with our food for about 20 or 30 minutes, and you clearly saw that we were ready to go, but you didn't take anything from our table ?  Like I said, service was friendly enough - and its not like the servers were sitting around doing nothing. They were clearly busy....which leads me to think that this is a management and training issue.  Too bad because the food is pretty good. I just don't think its worth the aggravation and the time.

Grilled cheese and apples Chicken fingers and fries Burger and fries I don't know what took 40 minutes because the food was ice cold, not warm - COLD I was hungry, my kids were hungry and it was late already so we ate it.  The cheese on the ""grilled cheese"" was cold not melted, they basically put American Cheese (the Kraft singles kind) in between two slices of buttered untoasted bread - YUCK! The fries were over fried and COLD, again - you serve burgers and fries why are they cold?! I promised my kids ice cream (now 9:30pm) almost 2 hours since our arrival with young kids is a long time - here comes a scoop of vanilla ice cream each and it was frozen, like freeser burn frozen and it was gross.  I have never complained about service in any place I've eaten but I couldn't NOT say something. The manager was VERY nice, and he did reduce my bill but I seriously don't know what's going on there.

You are having a bad day. Your dog died. Your best friend lied to you. I get it. I do. I rarely go out to eat. I can't really afford it and i never have  a night off to go anywhere anyway so whenever i do get the rare chance to dine out i try and pick a fairly cheap place with decent food that is close to where my friends and me live so we can get there quick. I decided to go here tonight. I haven't been here since i worked across the street a couple years ago. I always enjoyed the food here. So we got there around 8pm and they remodeled the spot and it looks great. I was really impressed. I mean i get it, its Red Robin but still it looks great. We got a seat in the bar and sat down while waiting for a 3rd member but i we were ready to order right away. I don't know what was up with the spot tonight whether they were short handed or what and i understand that. We sat for a while and finally got our server to take our order. He was fucking miserable. I tried really hard to be nice and friendly and joke around and he was not having it at all. Me and my gf ordered our burgers and drinks. We never got silverware and had to ask 2 different folks for it. The food was good. It was. But man oh man i felt like we were annoying the guy and when we asked for the check he just shoved the machine at us. WTF man. We were polite and nice and respectful. Didn't ask for anything crazy. I hate the fact i got treated like shit. The female manager was very nice she got us our refills and other things we needed. Im not gonna out the guy since im not about getting people in trouble on Yelp but for real man, try and crack a fucking smile.

I got in the restaurant and sat in the bar. I waited a couple minutes for the server, ordered my food and then waited, and waited. Finally she came back at about 25 min to tell me food was almost done... Then another 5-10 min after that it finally arrived.  I had a Royal Red Robin burger. Burger came out the exact way I ordered it! But the Garlic Parmesan fries were luke warm and not fully cooked. Plus for an extra dollar for garlic seasoning with no Parmesan cheese it wasn't everything I'd hoped for.  She came back about 1/2 into my burger to ask how everything was. I said, ""The fries..."" And she finished my sentence, ""Aren't cooked!"" I replied, ""Yep, can they remake them?"" Then I finished my burger and waited like 5-10 min for fries. They were good on arrival but at that point I wasn't even really into it at all. I ate them to be polite.  The only things I enjoyed were the milk shake I ordered at the end of the meal to drown my sorrows and the waitress for not being mean but honest and polite when I complained.

There seems to be a strong lack of communication at this Red Robin location. Our server was very unprofessional,  I witnessed him sit down at a table to take an order and complain about his shift. Twice another table's order wasn't to ours and the table to our left kept requesting more fries that just never made it to the table.  We went at my daughters request for a Birthday lunch and left in disgust without ordering any desert.

The waitress today took over 20 minutes before she came by to take our order, not even stopping by to ask if we wanted something to drink.  Half of the tables in the restaurant were empty. It took ANOTHER 25 minutes for our food, while stacks of food waiting to go out sat across the whole kitchen line.  The day manager instead of being active in the restaurant line of service, helping out the expedite process, paced around the restaurant spending most of the time looking out the front windows. It was like an episode of Kitchen Nightmares with the owner doing everything else but helping. His mind was elsewhere and I wonder what is going on in this man's life that is causing his lack of interest.  Don't work there if you aren't interested in the job!  The food isn't bad which is why you come here to being with. These aren't designer burgers from a boutique burger joint, although they share some similarities. The sweet potato fries are great.

However, twice we have gone there to have our appetizers be forgotten about, or have the extra pickles I asked for with my burger delivered to another table right in front of me. Fine. Whatever. People make mistakes. However, the last time was the final straw for us. We put our names on the list, and stood to the side. We saw a table for two who had come in AFTER us (by like at least five minutes) get seated before us. When I pointed this out to the host, he looked at me like I was an idiot and said I must have given him a different name since I'm not on the list, even though he had repeated my name back to me! Sorry, as far as I know, I only have one first name. Even the other table agreed we had been there first. The host refused and sat them first and then finally gave us a table in the bar area....again. We had our order taken relatively quickly, only to have our appetizer come out first and be totally finished before the waiter realized he didn't bring us drinks.

c w.,"Great Neck, NY",0,20,,2.0,3/27/2012,"sooooo....this review is difficult. ive only given them 2 stars, but i wanted to give them more. im not going to beat around the bush and ill just get to why they only get 2 stars: 1. service was terrible. our waiter was pleasant enough, but after he took our order...we never saw him again. we were there for a bit over an hour and he came around once to refill our drinks and once to ask us how the food was. he walked past us plenty of times...but would avoid looking at us as he went. 4 or 5 times i saw him just standing near the back talking to other wait staff people...not really doing anything. 2. the food. ok so we ordered the nachos, which were actually pretty good. they would have been better if our waiter had ever come by asking us if everything was ok so we could ask for salsa...but he never did so we ate it without the salsa. the big problem (and its a really big problem) was the burger. this place is a ""gourmet burger"" place, and they have lots of burgers that sound really good. since it was my first time there i ordered a plain old cheese burger. the waiter asked me how i wanted it and i told him...extra rare. my girlfriend ordered her burger medium.  when the burgers came hers was medium and mine was medium well. her burger had the slightest little hint of pink in it...and mine was a rubbery disc of charred flesh. i immediately waved the waiter over and showed him that not only was my burger not extra rare it was more done than my girlfriends medium burger. the waiter apologized and took it back saying they would make me another one.  a few minutes later...the floor manager came by also apologizing and proceeded to give me my new burger. i cut into it...and it was EXACTLY the same as the first one. blackened rubbery and medium well. it was at this point that i just gave up. i never did eat the burger and i wasnt about to to send it back a second time.   when the waiter finally returned to giv us our check i showed him the burger and said that it wasnt rare and in fact was just like the first one. he again apologized and then told me this...are you ready? : THEY DONT INDIVIDUALLY COOK THE BURGERS THERE...THEY HAVE THEM ON A CONVEYOR BELT AND THEREFORE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THE DONENESS OF THE BURGERS. what?????!!!!!  are you freaking kidding me?  what kind of ""gourmet burger"" restaurant cant cook to order??? at first i thought it was because they just wouldnt make a rare burger (some places stupidly are like that) but then they should have said that when i asked for it extra rare. but no...its because they dont cook to order.  so basically red robin is an expensive burger king.

Robert B.,"Bayside, NY",2,17,4,2.0,8/24/2013,"Red robin is known for their bottomless fries  and their variety or gourmet(ish) burgers. I didn't really get that whole experience when I went with my family. It was Friday night, but the place wasn't that busy and we got seated right away.  As soon as our waiter came, everything was weird. He seemed to ramble on about what he is supposed to do as a waiter. We order our drinks first (i had the mint brownie shake). At the table we had two shakes, lemonade and a diet coke, and we didn't get any water until we asked which was when the meal came. I find water to be necessary, especially when I have a shake with my meal.  The food was not as great as I would have expected. I had the A1 peppercorn burger medium with a sesame seed bun (instead of the onion one) and it was good for the first couple of bites. But halfway through, the burger became really soggy and Ye bottom bun started to fall apart. At that point I started on the fries. We had 4 burgers at the table, with 4 ""bottomless"" fries but we never got a refill on them, nor on the water.

Andrew B.,"Woodside, NY",6,68,11,2.0,8/13/2013,"I'll start by saying that I've loved Red Robin in the past for a suburban burger experience.  This location didn't deliver.  The restaraunt was crowded, but everyone was being seated and I'm sure it wasn't an unusual amount of people for a Sunday evening.  The service was SLOW, which is an understatement.  Our appetizers and drinks came quick enough after we waited 10 minutes for someone to come who didn't even turn out to be our waitress. But our burgers took forever to come with barely anyone coming to tell us the food was coming soon and appologizing (that came eventually).  In the time it took to get our burgers, I could have went next store to stop and shop and bought chuck steak, went across the street to the mall to the kitchen supply store and bought a meat grinder, set it up, ground the meat, formed it in to patties and cooked it and then go back to stop and shop, buy potatoes, cut them up and fry them. When the burgers did come, they were as I expected and remembered at other Red Robins in NJ and PA so at least that was good, but if I'm in the area, there's a very slim chance I'll be going back to this location.  There are other decent burger options in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=280

I was surprised they even had a bar in case soda or water isn't enough. I guess if your in the area and want something that's better then McDonald's or Burger King give this place a try.

Alison P.,"Garden City, NY",0,1,,4.0,11/10/2014,"I've been here a few times with the family and we've always had nothing short of excellent food and exceptional service. The staff is incredibly friendly from start to finish, and the only reason I didn't award this place 5 stars is because I felt sorry for the wait staff. The last time I visited Red Robin was on a Saturday night. Our waitress (cannot remember her name right now and it's driving me crazy) was very sweet and was sure to be attentive despite having to take care of so many tables. Having worked as a waitress through college I know how overwhelming a large section can be on a Saturday night. Our drinks arrived fast, the server was very knowledgeable about the menu, answering my sister's endless questions, and our food was served in a reasonable time frame for a Saturday night. My only complaint is that it took forever to get refills on the bottomless fries...to the point that I felt bad asking the waitress because I could see her standing in the kitchen asking the cooks for our fries and looking frustrated. She was very nice and apologized for the wait for fries, and was sure to stay on top of keeping those bottomless drinks coming in the meantime. My only other complaint is the clientele (yes I know that includes myself). This is where I really started to feel for my server. Like I said, I've worked in a restaurant so maybe I'm biased, but customers need to realize that the wait staff are people, not puppets. The people at the table next to us were extremely rude to our very sweet waitress for no reason. She was doing her job and doing it well. The poor girl isn't working for $3 to be treated like garbage and stiffed on the bill! I love Red Robin and I'll keep going back.

John P.,"Queens, NY",153,592,399,2.0,5/9/2012,"I stopped by here around 1PM on a Saturday and sat at the bar.  I had great service there, my glass was never empty.  i ordered the bacon cheeseburger and was asked how i would like it cooked.  I told her medium rare, and she responded by asking if i want it pink in the middle, which is the definition of medium rare, so i responded yes.  When my burger arrived 10 minutes later, there was no pink.  I'm not really one to send food back so i didnt complain, but based on c.w.'s post sending it back wouldn't have accomplished anything.  The burger is a very good size, it definitely filled me up, and there was a good amount of bacon. Taste wise, it was nothing special.  You can tell they are frozen patties and aren't spiced at all.  Bottomless fries come with the burgers which i appreciate, but the fries here don't deserve a second round.  They are very generic steak fries, which i'm not really a fan of.  Now if mcdonalds had bottomless fries, i'd have a serious health problem.  $13 for a burger, bottomless fries, and bottomless soft drinks isn't a bad deal for a sit down restaurant, but i'd go to almost any other fast food place before coming here. i'd leave just as full and definitely more satisfied for less money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=280

Joey G.,"Beechhurst, NY",4,15,1,1.0,7/31/2011,"Went there with a friend. We've never been to a 'Red Robin' establishment before, so we went in there with an open mind. My first impression walking in was nothing special. The joint looks like any other American chain 'applebee'ish ' restaurant. Place is fairly new to the neighborhood so i always give service and food a little slack. After we were seated, I had chance to examine the menu. Nothing out of the ordinary here. Typical American food with a decent burger selection. We figure to try the burgers since they claim it's ""the best in the universe"" FAR from it!  I got the 'burning love burger' because the waitress said it was good... ( which it wasn't at all ) and my friend got the 'red robin gourmet cheese burger'. We both asked for medium well done. Waitress comes and brings us our burgers and we also decided to try the mac n cheese. As we dig in, we noticed that her burger was rare. I decided to mention that to the waitress in her response tried to argue what medium well meant and did nothing about it but say that she went back and told the ""cook manager to cook the burgers better. "" she did not even offer to put it back on the grill or give her a new burger. And The mac and cheese was the worst i ever had. Extremely soggy. We left both our plates pretty much full. We also noticed people all around us complaining about how bad service was. A man was sitting waiting for a waitress to bring him a fork to eat his salad. We had no food so we offered him ours. And a lady walked out extremely upset mumbling towards me ""this was the worst service i ever had"". I had to agree with her. To top it all off ... I originally was going to give this place 2 stars but i was just informed there was also a hair in my friends fries that she didn't want to tell anyone to gross them out.  If you're in the area...

Jon D.,"ASTORIA, NY",131,40,1,3.0,7/7/2011,"Having spent about half of my childhood in California, I'd been to Red Robin quite a few times as a kid. There was one inside the mall in our town. I remember my mom taking me there for dinner to make up for dragging me from store to store for hours on end in search of ""a bra that fits"" (her, not me), which according to my mom was as difficult as finding a spacious reasonably-priced apartment on 5th Avenue.  What better way to placate a whiney exhausted (and traumatized) kid than with burgers and fries and strawberry lemonade?  Fast forward 15 years, and I'm sitting in an emtpy movie theater on the 4th of July with a friend late in the evening. We decide to give RR a go, so I check the website to make sure they're open and see that they close at midnight, giving us a good 2 hours to enjoy our meal. We get there and are greeted by 3 teenaged girls who spend 2 minutes staring at a seating chart trying to figure out where to seat us despite the fact that the place is almost completely empty. Finally, one of the girls brings us to this tiny 2 person table, despite the fact that all of the big comfy-looking booths are completely unoccupied. We ask to move to a booth and she agrees but then tries to put us in the booth directly behind the only other table with customers, who shoot us evil looks for invading their space. We ask if we can sit at one of the other 75 empty booths and she reluctantly agrees, and brings us to a booth where one of her coworkers is literally sprawled out on the seat ""chillin' like a villain"". The chick on her break gives a big dramatic sigh and slides out of the booth so we can sit, making us feel like dicks, even though we would have been happy to sit at any of the other booths. We start looking at the menu and the genius comes back and tries to seat another party at the booth right behind us, until they ask to sit at the next booth so we're not on top of each other. The girl clearly had no clue. While we decide what to eat, we notice that there are a TON of people working at the restaurant. Well, not working, actually; more like standing around in small groups or sitting at empty tables socializing. Weird.  Our waitress, Jackie, came and took our drink and appetizer orders and gave us more time to figure out what burgers we wanted. She was back in a flash with our drinks and patiently answered my friend's 5000 questions about the food and took down his precise instructions regarding his burger. What is it with Long Islanders and food, by the way? I've never met people who are so crazy about how they like their food prepared (fries WELL DONE, extra mayo, one piece of lettuce, pickles on the side, bun untoasted). She was very sweet and rushed off to place the order. I decided to use the restroom to wash my hands before eating. There were a group of employees standing in the aisle that led to the bathroom; they were chatting as if the restaurant were closed and were oblivious of me standing there. I had to say excuse me three times before they (barely) made room for me to pass without skipping a beat in their conversation. On my way back to the table, I almost fell and broke my ass on the ramp from the bathroom to the dining area because the floor was insanely slippery. The chatting employees sawme slip and almost fall, looked up to stare at me briefly and then resumed their conversation without saying a word, and again barely made room for me to walk by them. Don't you love it when you're made to feel that your presence is a nuisance at a restaurant? Back at the table, we sit waiting for our food and notice that Jackie is working her butt off cleaning tables, dusting lamps, and even getting on her knees to clean under the tables. She stops every few minutes to check on us and reassures us that our apps will be out soon. Eventually, after 20 mins she apologizes for the delay and goes to check on the order. 5 minutes later, we get our apps and our entrees simultaneously. Being that the place was staffed up the wazoo and practically empty, the wait time was unreasonable for some mozerella sticks, two burgers and fries. Jackie was clearly embarrased and apologized profusely before going back to working like Cinderella while her ugly stepsisters... uhm coworkers continued to socialize loudly throughout the restaurant without really doing anything productive as far as we could tell. We felt bad for poor Jackie.  As for the food, the apps were fine, nothing special. My blue cheese burger was delicious and huge. My friend didn't really like his burger, but I think that has more to do with him ordering the most plain burger on the menu and then making it even more boring with all his silly adjustments than anything else. The fries were good so we got a refill from Jackie. Then we paid and left Jackie a nice tip because she was great, but agreed that we probably wouldn't go back as even the best burger's not worth a 30 min wait and employees who act like you're interrupting their party.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=300

The problem is that there was nothing that stood out as being any better than any of the OTHER 50 or so quasi fast food places on Long Island.    The burgers at Ruby Tuesday or Houlihan's are just as good,  and I don't have to wait 45 minutes to eat there.  Nor do I have to be seated LITERALLY within 5 inches of another patron, squeezed into the high top tables near the bar because they are trying to cram in as many people as possible.

Enough about the perfectly proportional food.  Let's talk about the service.  There were a LOT of people when we went.  We waited about 20-30 minutes which was fine because they had free balloons that we could play with.  I liked the balloons. Once we were seated our waitress came by in about 5 mins to take our drink orders.  Even though the place was really busy she made an effort to show that she was paying attention to us.  She was clearly harried but she made herself available while, simultaneously, addressing the concerns of the grumpy old couple to our left and the complaints of the woman with a baby who had spilled apple juice everywhere to our right.   In conclusion, very nice staff.  Very proportional food.  Very red balloons.  That's a recipe for success.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=240

In fact, when I'm out with kids - I would rather drive another 2 or 3 miles to go to Friendly's. Why? This time I was out with the folks instead of kids. Ma ordered 2 appetizers for the table, both Mom & Dad ordered Root Beer Floats. While the waitress took our order for Entrees I ordered a Beer from their Happy Hour menu.  Had a whole conversation with the waitress about the special and asked: ""Is Guinness part of the your draft beers?"" (Exact words - I kid you not!) Reply: Yes. Mom & Dad's root beer floats took a good 20 minutes to come. Yea, we waited a good 10 mins. before the waitress came to take our food order and then another good 10 mins. went by before the Floats came. Another 5 minutes later the appetizers came. We ordered the Fried Zucchini and Fried Mushrooms. We got ONE mushroom each! Zucchini was actually delicious - so that is where they get the one star from. Another 10 minutes pass and we get our burgers. Dad liked his Banzai Burger a lot! I ordered the American, which was ok and Mom got the Mushroom and she said the same thing ""ok."" At this point still no Guinness. So, Mom tried flagging down our waitress and at this point we got it - she was ignoring us completely! I said loudly: ""Don't worry about it, I don't get my beer we don't pay for it!"" At the very end of our meal - guess what? My beer finally came! A few minutes later we had to flag down our waitress again for the check. We found out she overcharged us for the beer because Happy Hour is only in the Bar. Would have been nice if SOMEONE said so before they decided to FINALLY send the beer over. Mom knew I was PISSED OFF so she just paid everything in full. She was nice enough to leave a $7 tip and I said to only leave $5. Should I have gotten a hold of the manager it would not have been pretty. If you go to NCC, Hofstra, or Adelphi don't drink here!!!

The burger was less greasy and oily than Five Guys, and the whole presentation of the burger in itself was great, but the quality of the meat I have to say Five Guys tastes better.

We gave a very pleasant waitress our name and when we asked how long the wait would be, we changed our mind.  The waitress changed too...her demeanor!  Needless to say, we left Red Robin with a very bad taste in our mouths. In this tough economy where social media and word of mouth rule, businesses would be smart to train their staff on how to interact with customers--especially those first in the line of engagement.

Joey W.,"Elmhurst, NY",5,55,,3.0,9/12/2011,This is a good burger not great but it is a good deal.   I ordered a BBQ mushroom burger that had a fancy name.   It came with fries and I ordered a soda. The bill without tip was about 10-11 dollars and the fries are unlimited.  So compared with a Big Mac or a Whopper meal that costs about 8-9 dollars or Five Guys that costs about 9-10 dollars Red Robin is a few dollars more but it comes with more food and better atmosphere. The service and overall operations needs improvement.  Maybe in some smaller less populated and less demanding area like NJ or PA it would be OK but this is NY and they need to step up there game.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=220
Rob H.,"Flushing, NY",66,90,399,2.0,11/15/2011,"When I found out a Red Robin was being built relatively close by I was kind of excited.  I'd heard so much about them and those YUMMMMMMMMMM commercials kind of fed the excitement.   Having been there twice, my take on it is REEEEEEED ROBIN... Meh. Don't get me wrong, the place isn't terrible.  The burgers weren't bad, and they have a good number of choices, but it just wasn't all that fantastic.  Its not really their fault.  Its a chain, and like all chains, the food isn't exactly all that memorable.  (The french onion soup from TGIF being an exception, but mostly because that was like licking a salt wheel for a hamster) The burgers are large and juicy, but I don't recall them having an OMG quality.  For example, I'll remember the burgers I've gotten from The Spotted Pig and Burger Joint, but this one was instantly forgettable.  I remember there was stuff on it.  OK, there's lots of choices for stuff, but again, kinda forgettable.  The standouts are actually the chicken sandwiches - mostly because they do a very good job of making chicken breast not only edible, but tasty.  You have to understand my perspective - I find restaurant chicken breast to be dry, flavorless, and generally unpleasant.  Red Robin's chicken was pretty tasty.  I'd recommend chicken sandwiches and wraps over their burgers BY FAR. Red Robin offers unlimited fries, which is great for the people that love their fries.  If you're a fan of thick fries that taste like dry mashed potatoes with a skin then sure, go nuts.  I like thin & crispy fries.  That's not what you get, so this does absolutely nothing for me.  The last time I was there the fries were MUSHY and lukewarm.  There are a number of other sides and appetizers as well, though we only tried the jalapeno coins and fried clams.  The clams are tasty, but the coins are hit and miss.  The first time I tried them I loved them.  The second time they were crazy hot (spicy) and nearly inedible.   Good luck getting silverware.  On both occasions we had to ask different servers several times for a set, and it took a long time to get them.  I know these things are considered finger food, but FFS, its not too much to ask for a fork by default, is it? Like all chain restaurants in this area, prepare for a wait of epic proportions on the weekend.  Don't even bother trying to wait at the bar since there's going to be a wait for a place to wait at the bar. If you're curious about the place, sure, go on, enjoy yourself.  If you're in the area and want a decent burger, drive a little further to 5 Guys.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=220
Mike F.,"New York, NY",3,66,24,3.0,10/23/2011,"Okay, so in reading the other reviews, I'm starting to see a pattern here not unlike my two visits.  The food is four-star quality and the service is three, at best.  The only thing saving it from a two-star is the fact that they comped almost the whole ticket on our last visit. Just to recap... We go there on a Saturday night around 730pm.  We expect it to be busy and it is.  We wait about 20 minutes to be seated (shorter than the half-hour they predict).  We're go so far... We sit down and order our drinks: two root beer floats and a glass of water.  This is where things get dicey.  First, the water comes to the table with apologies that the bartender is having ""a hard time"" making our floats.  When they do finally show up, they're literally half-full.  I'm thinking to myself ""thank god they're bottomless"" and we have a laugh about it.  Then, the waiter takes our food order.  He's a nice enough guy but he kind of has that thousand-yard stare of a soldier who's been to hell and back...and apparently, if you work at Red Robin in Carle Place, you have. He sees we finished our floats so he informs us he already put in for two new ones because he noticed they were half-full.  Good thing, because it took another fifteen minutes to get them and when he puts them half-full on the table, we all start laughing.  He apologizes again for the bartender being a loaf and also puts down a full pint glass of root beer to pour into our floats as we sip away at them. Now we wait for the food. The waiter comes back after about a half-hour and tells us our food is late, thus overstating the obvious. He tells us he's going to check on it and comes back with three burgers.  Just not ours.  As it turns out, the kitchen screwed all three of them up.  Again, apologies ensue, as well as laughter when he's leaves the table.  He returns shortly thereafter and tells us the manager will be dropping our burgers off shortly and apologizes yet again. Ten minutes later, the manager shows up with two burgers for three people.  When he sees three hungry people sitting there, he tells us ""oh, I guess there's supposed to be a third"".  Again, apologies and laughter commence. After the elusive third burger shows it's face, we dig in to what are seriously some damn good burgers.  We had two prime chophouse burgers and a royal red robin.  My chophouse burger was unevenly cooked, but it still tasted really good.  The sweet potato fries (ordered well-done) were crisp and fresh.  The steak fries on the other two burgers were really good as well.   The big surprise here was the mac and cheese.  I ordered it almost as a goof because I've never had it from any restaurant that was any good but their mac and cheese was fantastic.  It was cheesy and buttery and the macaroni was perfectly cooked. See?  The food is great.  You just have to wait for it. The manager comped our burgers. We still paid for the half-floats, but I could live with that. We also tipped like we paid for a full meal.  There's no reason the waiter had to suffer for the kitchen's and bartender's incompetence.  The guy worked his butt off.  People should remember that when you get a comped ticket.  If it's not the wait staff's fault, don't take it out on them.   All in all, I will go back with the hope that they will get their act straight.  If not, i can at least hope for a free three-hour meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=220

And then i returned in december 2014 with hopes it got bettwr.  But alas i was wrong. I ordered the bleu ribbon burger which was way too salty. It took close to 27 minutes to get our food and that was just the appetizer. The burgwr came 15 minutes after that. The burger was again luke warn.

I've been back MANY, MANY times since then, and I gotta say that I do agree that it's gone WAAAAY downhill. And that sucks because this is the only Red Robin in this area. I love the food and the shakes. The prices are fair. But the service is terrible! Terrible means waiting 30 minutes before the server even comes by to take drink orders. It means having your order screwed up in more ways than one. It means trying to flag down someone ANY ONE to get a refill, that is IF the bartender FEELS like making mixed drinks. We were told one night that the bartender was DONE making ""complex"" drinks and we needed to limit our drink orders to something they can pull out of a tap. We came at 11pm once (they close at midnight) and the kitchen decided they weren't going to bread the mushroom I ordered as an app because they didn't feel like it. When the food does come out right, it's hard to enjoy it because 9 times out of 10, they FORGET to put utensils and napkins on the table.  How does a franchise fail on every single aspect of customer service??? Where is the manager? Where is the service checks to make sure your staff is performing well? A bartender who doesn't know what beer they carry or refuses to make drinks? A kitchen staff that can't read a ticket and skips protocol on food prep? And servers who are either too busy or don't have enough experience on how to wait on multiple tables? I don't get it. I LOVED my Red Robin dinners with my buddies, but coming out aggravated after another bad dining experience with them isn't worth ruining a Friday or Sat night.  With so many other dining options in the area, this one is now easily skipped.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=200

Alexandra S.,"Westbury, NY",0,24,,4.0,1/12/2016,"Nice,casual place...Burgers are pretty good, although I prefer their California chicken sandwich.  The reason I'm not giving them 5 stats is because out of, at least 10 times that I've been there, a few the food was brought just hardly warm, so every time we go there, we have to tell the waitress to bring us food while it's hot. The desserts are really good, especially the Mud pie, although they cut the portion size. One thing i don't like is that if you want to substitute french fries for something else, they really overcharge you, unless it's a little salad of small dish of rotten fruit. If you want something else, like sweet potato fries, it's like $3 extra. Stupid, in my opinion. The refillable lemonades are really good... Overall, it nice and I will continue going there.

Adam V.,"Huntington, NY",69,94,33,2.0,6/21/2012,"I really liked this place the first time I went here, but each time I came back, it was progressively more disappointing. It's kind of difficult to find parking because this restaurant shares a private lot with a lot of busy stores in this little shopping pavilion. You should also be prepared to wait if you come at a popular lunch or dinner time and a lot of people bring their children here so it can get kind of hectic with all the little rugrats dashing wildly around your legs as you wait in the cramped little waiting area. The burgers are cheap and I believe you get infinite fries as long as you keep asking for them but I wouldn't see why you would because their fries are VERY mediocre and the only real reason to eat them is to mindlessly stuff your face hole full of food. I really like their Burnin' Love burger because I'm a big fan of jalapenos.

In Pennsylvania when you order a monster shake they give you enough for two shakes, here they make the shake and whatever is left in the container they give you, and sometimes that is only a dribble. When we complained about it they told us that it depends on who makes it. So, we gave up paying extra for just a dribble and when we go we don't order the monster shakes anymore. Their loss. I think I would rather travel the extra 2 hours and go to the one in Pennsylvania instead, the staff is friendlier.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=320
Wolf G.,"Delray Beach, FL",272,228,185,3.0,1/30/2012,"After Red Robin came to Long Island and my friend who used to enjoy Red Robin when he lived in Colorado, we decided to go this Red Robin when he was visiting me from Florida along with his girlfriend. Walking into Red Robin, you will find that the atmosphere is clean and cheerful, with all sorts of kitschy items like posters hanging on the wall. After we were seated, I decided to order a Banzai Burger wrapped in lettuce due to my gluten allergies with fries and a Diet Coke. Within fifteen minutes, our burgers and fries arrived and I was ready to dig in. While the burger was seasoned well and was complimented by the sweet and sour pineapple and the fresh and crisp lettuce and tomato, I found the burger to be somewhat disappointing as it was kind of dry and crumbly. The burger may have been disappointing, but the fries (which are unlimited) were thick, wide, and filled with potatoey goodness and were complimented the spicy seasoning at the table. Service from our waitress was friendly and accommodating as well. As far as the prices, they are OK, at about $9 for a burger and fries. While I would go back to this Red Robin as my friend is a huge fan of it, I prefer Bobby's Burger Palace at Roosevelt Field or Five Guys for a better burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=320

There are chains, Ruby Tuesday in particular, that have way better burgers.

Mitch B.,"Nassau County, NY",8,77,12,1.0,11/4/2014,"Poor service begins and ends in the kitchen, not with the wait staff or manager.  Stopped in around 11:30 am on Tuesday, really craving a burger and beer and figuring l'd give Red Robin a try instead of the other burger places in the area.  The place was empty but for two or three tables.  No one was manning the front so the bartender took the initiative and led me to a high table in his area.  I was the only patron there.  Within 5 minutes I had ordered a burger and was starting into my beer.  After a while the bartender headed back to the kitchen to inquire on my burger.  Nothing.  Over the next  20-25 minutes, he went back no fewer than 4 times, apologizing to me after the third time. From my vantage point, I could see his frustration with the cook, who seemed to be making a joke over the situation.  By this point there were maybe seven tables occupied in the restaurant so there was no great pressure on the kitchen.  In any event, it should not take a half hour to get a burger in an empty burger house.   I couldn't help but wonder what was gonna happen when lunch hour was in full swing?  After his fourth visit to the kitchen, the bartender came back with a plate of fries, saying at least I'd have something to nosh on while I waited.  I had actually watched him take two plates off the kitchen counter, apparently for me, only to put one of them back at the direction of the cook.  It appeared to me that the cook was simply enjoying messing with the bartender's order.   At that point I advised the bartender that I was about ready to pay for the beer and leave.  He hustled back to the kitchen, this time with the manager.  I finished my beer and took one of the fries.  It was lukewarm.   I was done.  Rather than make a scene, I stood up, placed $5 on the bar, and asked a young woman sitting there, who appeared to be friends with the bartender, to tell him the money was for the beer and that I had left.  I walked out while the manager and the bartender were  both in the kitchen area, presumably trying to resolve the matter. In the parking lot, I was furious that I had wasted a half hour being played, and I was pissed at myself for leaving anything for the beer.  I called from the car to speak to the manager who was aware of what had happened and was extremely apologetic and gracious.  He offered to make good on it  if I would return to the restaurant, but I told him all I wanted was my $5 back on principle.  He agreed and met me outside with the $5 and the burger and fries wrapped to go, which he insisted I take as a token of his apology.  I did not get his name, but he warrants praise for handling the situation professionally.   When I got to my destination ten minutes later, the bun was soggy and the burger cold.  What a waste.  Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=160

Bryan V.,"Franklin Square, NY",6,17,,2.0,9/17/2014,"Okay, so, I have two desperate experiences that I want to discuss for this Red Robin. 1) First time, I went with 3 friends. I had a chicken burger and we ordered some appetizers, and those were actually pretty good. So as far as food is concerned, I can't complain tremendously about the first time. However, the service is where the major issues were. The service was moderately slow (not as bad as the second time, but I'll get back to that). The person who made the experience quite unfortunate was the waitress. She was quite poor and granted, my group can be a little loud, that's just how we are. But I guess our waitress took a disliking to us. She'd purposely avoid coming the table to ask us if there was anything we needed. A few times times we even made eye contact with her, it was obvious she saw us, but she went about her business.  The final straw was when my friend and I went to the bathroom. As we were coming back, we heard our waitress talking about us and describing some of the members of our group with inappropriate language. We were so upset that we didn't even leave a tip. I have the utmost respect for people who work in the food industry and like to leave no less than a 20% tip, but there was a clear crossing of the line. Also, my friend has a gluten intolerance disease and he needed his French fries prepared in a separate batch. The first batch seemed to settle in okay, but as soon as he wanted to take advantage of the bottomless fries, he started feeling sick, which led us to believe there was some cross contamination 2) Two of my friends and I decided we'd give Red Robin another chance, but this time turned out to be worse than the first. This time, the waitress we had was about the only good part of it. She was incredibly sweet and apologetic about the woefully slow service we had.  I would never recommend the clucks and shrimp dish. It was shameful how tiny and poor quality the portion was for the price they charged. It was disgraceful. I had to eat like three rounds of French fries because I was starving after having the 3 baby shrimp and 2 small chicken tenders.  During that experience, my friends think we discovered why their service is so abominable. They have their bottomless fries and drinks, but probably want to discourage people from sticking with the slow service. Also, many of the French fry refills were cold when we finally got them.  My friend, once again, got very sick from what we think was cross contamination. We were happy the manager came out and apologized, taking off his meal from the bill, but health means more than money. Because of the slow service and the way the food affected my friend, it's safe to say there will not be a third time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=160
Jennifer H.,"New York, NY",12,147,331,5.0,12/23/2014,"There really isn't anything bad to say about this place. The wait was pretty long, but that's not really something that can be helped on a Saturday night. The service also didn't suffer because of it. Our server was really attentive and our food came out really quickly despite the fact that almost every table was occupied. I got the crispy chicken burger, which wasn't bad. It wasn't anything fancy, but I would highly recommend and return. My friend and I also didn't know bottomless steak fries actually comes with the meal, so it was an added bonus when we found out we didn't have to pay extra for them. The fries were definitely cooked to my liking. Usually when something like that is produced in massive amounts, it tends to be less than appealing, but they were yum.

Semi Chef C.,"Long Island, NY",8,49,12,2.0,6/13/2011,"UPDATED: Stopped by again 2 months later to give them another shot. My review stands; the service still needs a lot of work and many common mistakes are being made by the servers and cooks. I'm not sure any number of free entree courtesy coupons is worth the trouble. A+ Excellent concern portrayed by the managers, I will say, but ultimately if problems aren't ever corrected how many times can one say I'm sorry. Originally written near Opening Day Stopped by the new Red Robin today, we were in the area and they offered a free Dining test run for up to 4 people , so we decided to give it go. This free offer was meant to evaluate and train the staff who are courteous, albeit a little green, which is understandable, today being the first day, so bear this in mind when reading. I've been pretty exited a Red Robin was opening in our area because it's very difficult to find a place for good burgers. However there were some real problems with the food and service that left us a little annoyed despite the meal costing only a tip. Had we paid full price, I would have been pretty upset as would most anyone.  Our waitress who was clearly nervous and perhaps a little overwhelmed took our drink orders; 2 ice tea's and a shake, then she disappeared. 10 minutes later, another waitress, noticing our frustration came by and explained to me the first waitress went on break during our service, she must not have put the order in or told anyone our table was waiting.  So, we received our drinks, less the milkshake and she took our order for food. One entree, cod fish and chips and a blue cheese burger, pretty simple chain food fair. For some reason, the milkshake never arrived, we called the waitress back about 5 minutes later,  she seemed a little confused as to why the milkshake had not been brought to us, puzzling. She ran into the back and about 5 minutes later we were enjoyed a mint milk shake, it was pretty good.  20 minutes went by and our food finally came out. This is also when our disappointment and starving anger started to take hold. The burger, which was ordered ""a little pink inside"" their words not mine,  was well done and cold. The entree fried cod fish and chips, never made it to us, instead they served me a cod fish sandwich on a bun.  Both items were sent back and at this point 2 managers caught wind of this debockle and came over to interject. We explained all of the little nuances making this a wild dining experience and they acted quickly to resolve the situation, both were extremely courteous and empathetic.  About 5 minutes later the cod fish entree came out, and I must say it was pretty incredible. My guest and I were splitting the food to give everything shot and the burger was warm this time,still well done, not ""a little pink inside"" as requested and the bun was still a little frozen.  The manager came back and explained the buns were baked fresh in Texas, then shipped frozen and were supposed to be toasted before serving. Somehow this step was skipped and well, it was a pretty bad burger, didn't get through more than a large bite of it and at this point another send back would have made no redemption.  Overall it took about 1 hour 25 minutes to eat lunch, taking into account our indecisiveness because just about everything on the menu looked great, the disappearing waitress and botched orders.  The Table behind us has already been served appetizers and drinks for 5 and I noticed a table full of managers who sat after we did, were enjoying some really good looking food, ;-(   I'm am an experienced cook and make all sorts of gourmet burgers and sandwiches myself; from smoked pulled pork hoagies to braised shanks and more refined dishes, I have a pretty high expectation for dining out and don't often go for one of these D&B chat-ski food is fun type places and after this visit, I think I further reinforced that idea. Still, for a quick burger and fries and some inventive appetizers after a movie, it might be the way to go compared to other places in the area. I'll give them another shot sometime soon giving them more time to work out the kinks in customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=160
NoCooking R.,"Manhattan, NY",7,55,4,1.0,11/1/2013,"Let me start this off by saying I HAD to dine here (I detest chains bc they never cease to unimpress me) because of the gluten free menu available for a fellow trick-or-treater in the group (not my child). Now that I've gotten that squared away;  we were a group of 9, four adults and five kids. The place was fairly quiet when we arrived after TOT'ing yesterday so there was no reason the service should have been as slow as it was but I digress.  It started to really fill up as we were getting the check TWO hours later.  Now, for a burger chain, this one is pitiful.  I ordered the Bruschetta chicken burger and there was no Bruschetta on it.  The bread was chewy and not fresh.  The food was lukewarm, not hot.  My kids had a pizza and cheeseburgers.  Kids eat crap anyway so I'm just glad they were eating something other than their bag of candy at this point although feeling like a terrible parent for bringing them here... We ordered the tower of onion rings which took too long to arrive.  It was hot at least. The food took forever to come out. Asking for a round of water for the table of our waiter was met with an excuse and the need to remind him.  What the what?  I'm paying you!   We placed our order after waiting too long for him to take it.  My poor son even complained.  He's 9!   My husband ordered a burger and when asked twice by a friend how it was, kept evading the question. I looked at his burger-  it looked like a beef patty not a burger.  Something is wrong with that when this is considered a burger joint. I ordered coffee with my dessert that I never got.  The ""endless bowl of fries"" offer that they claim is really only as good as your server.  I was lucky to my second serving of fries as we were ready to ask for the check, that I had to share with my table because no one else was being asked if they wanted more fries. My friend next to me ordered a chicken wrap and I noticed mostly coleslaw as filler with slices of chicken in the middle.  Pathetic.  My chicken bruschetta was awful.  It was a chicken brick that was warm when it finally arrived. I took a few bites and left it. The waiter was non-existent except to pretend to be helpful as he whizzed by robotically asking ""how's everything?  Good?"" and then he was gone. Dessert was gross.  My slice of red velvet looked greasy and unappetizing.  One bite proved it tasted like their fridge needed a box of arm and hammer baking soda.   This location serves old dessert. My husband said his brownie bowl was no better. There was no flavor!   I took one for the team eating here.  The best was when, our non existent smiley waiter appeared after we paid the bill to ask us to participate in a survey about our experience! Are you kidding me?  Every time I turned around too look for you, I saw you laughing and chatting in the kitchen!   Please spare yourself and go to Anthony's a few doors down if you don't need a gluten free option on a moments notice.  Ugh.  I'm actually sad that this meal cost us 80.00 per couple when all was said and done.  We split the bill.   Bathrooms:  decently maintained but all the way over by the bar and when you are coming out of the ladies room with your children men are coming out of the men's room directly across giving you full view of their bathroom and stalls inside!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=160
Pam F.,"Jackson Heights, NY",133,161,16,4.0,11/24/2013,"I just cheated on Shake Shack and have no regrets... YIKES! I ordered the Bleu Ribbon burger added with mushrooms, my husband got the A1 Peppercorn Burger, and our friend ordered the Prime Chophouse. All were cooked the way we liked and enjoyed it. The fries were good, but the best part is that they're bottomless! For shakes, I ordered the Salted Caramel and my buddy ordered the Gingerbread shake. I liked my shake but his was better. I'm assuming it's seasonal so get it while it last. As far as service goes, our waiter couldn't be more courteous. The manager also took the time to check in on us and other customers, that was nice. My hubby became an instant fan of this place so we'll be visiting more often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=160
