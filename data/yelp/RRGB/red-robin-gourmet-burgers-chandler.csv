Jared S.,"Chandler, AZ",279,268,363,5.0,8/27/2016,"Love this Red Robin location! We always get really good service and I love how they cater to vegans. You can subtitle a Bocca burger (or garden burger) on any of their burgers free of charge. I also LOVE the bottomless fries, they're SO GOOD!  I usually get a Bocca burger with pineapple, teriyaki, avocado and wrapped in lettuce   It's really really good! Shout out to Brent...he is an awesome server and always makes sure we are taken care of.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=20
Amy B.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,58,19,1.0,9/9/2016,"We visited Red Robin on Chandler Blvd. by Chandler Mall tonight. We ordered our food about 10 minutes after 8pm. It was just my husband and I. We contemplated getting up and leaving because we noticed how filthy dirty the restaurant was. Bathrooms had trash all over, the restaurant floors were so dirty - used napkins on the floor and tons of food all over the floor, and right next to me, some white smeared something on the booth that I didn't see when we were seated. (See pic). Many tables went in-bussed the entire visit. However since we were very hungry we figured we would eat quick and go and try not to touch anything. Bad choice!  Both of our meals came out incorrect and nothing was done to rectify mine. I took 1 single bite and realized that even though I asked for no mayonnaise it had it anyway. My husband asked for a side salad instead of fries - he got fries. A person (manager I believe) brought the side salad out right away. Our server Justin took my chicken sandwich back and it took long enough for my husband to eat his entire meal - fish and chips and salad. I finally asked for my replacement meal to go because we couldn't wait any longer. I left having not eaten but the one bite and some fries.  I have to say I was disappointed that not even a simple apology from our server or a manager was given. And that I paid for my meal that I didn't get to enjoy. Nothing was done to rectify the situation for a meal I didn't even get to eat. Unfortunately we left a $0 tip. I felt bad but why should I have left feeling bad? My guess or hope was that they were understaffed hence the slow service and dirty tables and floors.  In all, we were there for about an hour and 10 minutes. I won't return to that location again. I'm a Red Robin Loyalty Rewards member so I usually enjoy it but tonight it was anything but enjoyable. If you're in the mood for RR, I suggest going to a different location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=20

Juan M.,"Chandler, AZ",1419,1110,17446,3.0,6/24/2016,Waiters have become unaware of the products it seems since they rely heavily on the electronic order taker. That tool is such a pain in the butt.

Matt F.,"Mesa, AZ",77,7,4,2.0,7/22/2017,"I love Red Robin but unfortunately this location really dropped the ball. We ordered a few burgers for pickup and when we got them home, we realized they had overcooked 2 of the burgers severely and the sides were burnt to a crisp. Fries were still good though and not all the burgers were overcooked so thats a plus!

Brian R.,"Saint Louis, MO",84,245,773,2.0,10/4/2016,"It's a burger chain. The waiter was a bit aloof, and it took him awhile to bring our drinks and take the food order. I had the royale burger. It was a decent burger, although the egg was over medium when I requested over easy. The burger was cooked properly (medium). It was fairly juicy and tender, which was certainly a plus.  The bottomless fries were average. I would have liked them to be a bit more crispy, but they weren't too ""limp"" like some places. When I requested a second basket of fries, it took him awhile. I was already done with my burger at that point. For dessert, I had the mud pie. This was very good and absolutely huge!! I really enjoyed it, as I am a big fan of chocolate. Overall, what you would expect. Quite a few inconsistencies and below average service. Average food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=20
Janet M.,"Dunsmuir, CA",8,52,2,1.0,5/26/2017,"I've been a long time customer of Red Robin's throughout the us and while some are better than others, this location is sadly the worst I've ever come across. My first visit there back in December with out of town guests (grandkids in tow) was a very expensive and unsatisfactory experience.  Not much was correct or edible about our $160 dinner.  Fast forward to today. My guests were another grandchild and my daughter. It started off sketchy when we ordered our drinks which consisted of a lemonade, an iced tea and a chocolate milk. The lemonade was watered down, which indicates they need to refill the syrup, and the iced tea tasted like burned rubber or plastic. After letting our server know, and not getting so much as an apology, my daughter ordered a coke and I requested a hot tea and a glass of ice.  Next, was our meal... my daughter wasn't asked until after we were completely done with our meal if she'd like more fries, and my avoCobbo salad was missing the avocado, and the chicken was charred and dry. I told the server about the avocado and she delivered 3 skinny avocado pieces, again, without so much as an apology. The tomatoes in the salad appeared to have been diced a few days ago since they were mushy and not the right color. The table was never cleared of the iced tea and lemonade that we had replaced. And the food overall was again below mediocre.  As much as I have enjoyed Red Robins in the past 30 years, I will never again attempt to give this one another chance. I've thrown enough hard earned money away giving this one close to my home a chance to redeem themselves. This Res Robin gets an F in my book.  You would think, with as many good restaurants in that immediate area, they'd try a little harder to please their customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=20
Courtney M.,"Queen Creek, AZ",207,177,352,4.0,3/18/2017,"I've been to this Red Robin twice, once for lunch and another time just for drinks. I wouldn't usually go to Red Robin for drinks but it was a large party of people and a few of them didn't have their ID so we weren't able to go to the establishment we had initially intended to but I digress. I usually order the Red Robin Royale burger or the chicken sandwich with the teriyaki sauce and pineapple, or sometimes my husband and I order one of each and split them. When we came here for lunch I remember my sandwich being extra messy and difficult to eat because of all the sauce but the flavor was on point. I have no complaints about the customer service here. Their bathrooms are always clean when I go however the stalls are rather small which makes it extra cramped in there when there's a line of women and you're trying to squeeze out of the stall closest to the door. This Red Robin isn't the closest one to my apartment but I much prefer it over the one that is so I have no problem returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=20

David P.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,184,,1.0,12/2/2017,"Ever had a craving for something you used to love but hadn't had in a long time? That was me tonight for Red Robin.  Oh so silly.  Guacamole bacon burger now nearly $12. What! Tried the ""big"" Tavern Taco Burger. At $10 it's the same size patty as the guac burger. To be fair, it was cooked properly and tasted decent.  But it's not a $10 burger.  Asked for a monster chocolate,  raspberry shake.  Only $5. But it's 1/2 the size it used to be. Didn't taste raspberry at all. I'm pretty certain they used to use real, hard, ice cream. What they use now comes out of a soft serve machine. If it is still ""ice cream,"" then it's 10% milk fat. Runner who brought meal didn't ask if I needed anything. Catsup would have been nice. Bottomless fries are only bottomless if more are offered. They weren't until I was clearly completely done. Bartender/ server had other things on his mind. Looks like there might be a group of regulars. Nice guy. Distracted. Or didn't care.  It's very rare that I don't tip.  I didn't.  Will have to beat down future cravings. Darn. Used to patronize this chain a lot. Now I remember why I stopped.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler
Gillian C.,"Gilbert, AZ",92,108,285,4.0,10/22/2017,"We came here for lunch.  We were quickly seated in the lounge.  Nice atmosphere.   Friendly staff-quick to refill drinks- Also no waiting.  It was a great seat, not too loud and there was a good hame to watch. I ordered my burger with added  bleu cheese, red onions (in addition to onion straws that came on it), and sauce on the side.  They forgot the onion straws. Easily fixed-they brought some out on a plate w/apoligies. Everything else was correct about my burger. The burger was cooked correctly but when it came out, I could tell it had been sitting for a bit.  It was luke-warm....not piping hot.  The onion fries they brought out weren't ""hot"" (temp) either.  I also ordeted a side of pickles (after-the-fact) and they were luke warm.  Pickles should have been cold like the red onions and tomatoes, lol.  Never-the-less, It was a very tasty burger and the onions, tomatoes, bacon, pickles added a freshness and crispness that blended well with the burger and bun. The mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy with a nice crispy breadcrumb topping....well worth the upcharge for a premium side dish.  Add some chicken and it is a dish in its own right. My husband like his lunch....same as mine without all the add ons, lol but with the endless fries. He's not easily impressed so food is food, not something to ""Yelp"" about, lol.  We did order a second serving of the endless fries but it took a while.  We paid our bill and ended up leaving without the second helping. Not a big deal but i would recommend ourdering your ""endless fries""  when your plate arrives.  That way, you actually get them in a timely manner when you are almost done with the first serving.  (Just a recommendation.) Overall, it was a nice lunch.  I took a star due to for not getting my food correct/temp of correct add ons.  I'm not sure the disconnect between what the waitstaff writes down and what the cooks ""understand"" but there is no reason that the waitstaff can't check orders to make sure things are correct.  (I did that as a waitress.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler

Deb K.,"Chandler, AZ",6,53,,2.0,10/7/2017,"I ordered lunch take out whiskey burger, fries and spinach/artichoke dip thru Grubhub two days ago..  Due to how filling the burger was, I decided to save the dip for dinner....     The burger was hot and fresh but sooo disappointed because they put grilled onions on it instead of onion straws! (which is one of my favorite parts!). They put so many grilled onions on there I could have made a blooming onion out of them! (If I would have breading on them like it should have had!) After pulling most of them off, the burger was delicious! Come on cooks...get it right...not so hard to tell the difference in GRILLED onions and onion STRAWS! Next time I would ask for extra BBQ sauce on the side tho...not enough on it for my liking. (I consider that my fault so no minus stars!)      The fries were IN A CUP?? The burger in a nice container where it stayed hot, but the fries were in a cup in the bag and were cold by the time they were delivered. Really? In a cup on the side? PLENTY of room in that big plastic container with the burger!  I was happy they added a side packet of seasoning for the fries tho! One Star Bonus!      I specifically asked for NO ONION or tomato on the artichoke dip. ... HM... SURPRISE! Lots of little onions peeking at me when I opened the dip at dinner! Should have known after the cooks not knowing the difference of onion straws vs grilled onions they wouldn't know what NO ONIONS on the dip would mean either.        The small container was only HALF FULL of dip and after picking all the little pieces of onion off, less than half was left.  I only needed 5 of the 20 chips they included to eat the small portion of dip but at least they were fresh and salted.       5 stars for grubhub delivery but 2 stars (generous) for Red Robin.

So I thought awesome, this must be worth waiting for *just kidding* . What a disaster . Lunch took an hour to be seated and served a burger that was beyond gross ! I'm providing pics as proof that I am providing an  honest review . I ordered the BDL burger and a bowl of French onion soup. It was supposed to have sun dried tomatoes, arugula , and a mayo based  sauce that  made the burger and bun SWIM in grease I wish I was kidding , or even exaggerating!! I tried twice to pick it up and had grease running down my hands .. I also ordered a bowl of French onion soup that consisted of crunchy 1/2 cooked (not caramelized like they are supposed to be) onions, topped with 2 slices of soggy bread (not toasted) and melted cheese . I left hungry and pissed off . My time and my money were both wasted at this place . I would love to know what the crowds of people were ordering ?!?!? On a side note the manager came over and apologized and removed the burger from the bill . He also gave us a coupon for free appetizer or dessert on our next visit . If anyone wants it let me know ! I will not waste another moment of my time or money here",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=40
Terry W.,"Gilbert, AZ",17,816,129,4.0,4/24/2015,"Time to update my review, it seems.  We found ourselves here for dinner because we had an appointment in the area.  Not much has changed, really.  It's Red Robin.  A burger joint.  Their burgers are pretty good and the endless fries are nice too.  At dinner time the place is LOUD.  Much worse than I recall for lunch.  Maybe the kids?  It was a pretty full house. I had the peppercorn burger, the wife had a chicken salad.  The chicken was odd.  Unexpected texture.  They took care of it in a timely fashion.  My burger was pretty good.  Really probably 3.5 stars, but for a burger place they are pretty consistent and good.  So I don't want to round down. Due to time constraints we had to eat and run.  I think service was reasonably quick, especially given how busy they were.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=40
TJ H.,"Chandler, AZ",652,242,348,3.0,1/11/2016,"C and I hit the RR for some burgers. I had a birthday ""free burger"" coupon that I needed to use before it expired. I think our visit was predestined when we first walked up to the front doors. C held open the door for a group of 5 as they were leaving. NONE of them said ""Thank You"". Seriously? Get some manners &%$holes. When someone holds a door open for you whether you're coming or going, acknowledge them. Geez, my 10 year old has better manners than most adults.  Anywhoos, as I said, that should have told us how our night would go. After the human turds left, we went up to the host stand and waited. Hmmm, I'm sure someone will help us soon I told C. It wasn't that long, maybe a minute or 2 but eventually a hostess came up, grabbed some menus and walked us to our table. We sat and then waited for our server. And wait we did. After 10 minutes (I start the timer on my phone as soon as we're sat) I told C we would give them another minute before leaving. C suggested that we just move to another table because he really wanted a RR burger and reminded me that I had my birthday coupon. Alright, we gave our server another minute to show up, they didn't, so I walked back over to the host stand and asked to be re-sat. The same hostess apologized and took us to another section. Now we've been there 15 minutes and are finally getting started.  Our second server was Sydney. Awesome. She apologized for the issue and took our drink orders. NOTE: If you're ordering your kid one of the fancy lemonades, make sure they bring the kid version. We've been charged over $4 for C to get a ""Poppin Lemonade"" in the past but this time, it was $1.19. Just saying... So C got his Poppin Purple lemonade ($1.19) which came with a free refill this time. We had to pay for the refill last time. Interesting. C also ordered the Little Red's Burger with Fries ($4.99). The burger was cooked properly, Medium, and the fries as well. C had also ordered a side of pickles, as he always does and Sydney hooked him up. 16 pickles in a little ramekin. C was a happy camper. I ordered the Peppercorn Burger ($10.99), sauce on the side with endless Broccoli. The patty was cooked a perfect medium rare and was seasoned correctly. This was a tasty burger. The issue came with the Broccoli. Both times, the original and refill, were undercooked. Not by a little, by a lot. Hard, basically raw broccoli just isn't complimentary to the meal. Bummer. Sydney brought out the Birthday Sundae for C and I to share. Some average vanilla ice cream with fudge on top but it was a nice way to finish the meal.  Crappy first 15 minutes of service, good kids burger, good peppercorn burger, good fries, lousy broccoli, great service from Sydney Po. 3.5 Stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=40

We sat in a half booth half table. Ok. Well the lighting in her is SO poor we could hardly read the menu. I have to say as a former server, I HATE THE TABLE TOP SELF ORDERING! Why would you want to take money out of your servers pockets??? Ok maybe on a Friday or Saturday night it might be helpful to those in a rush but as soon as I see one of those, I know service will be subpar. Thankfully it was a week day and we came in for lunch. After using my cell phone for light I ordered a wedgie burger. Service was adequate and our order was placed. The fried pickles were so over breaded so much that you could hardly taste the  dill. I ordered my burger rate and it came out medium well, thin little party.

It's messy, but he mentioned how much he loved tinkering around how to eat the thing. The manager actually gave him a ""secret tip"" on how to eat it (hint: Eat your burger 25% at a time). He mentioned how the flavors came together and was a very unique taste.

Jeff G.,"Playa del Carmen, Mexico",96,24,,1.0,4/17/2017,"The quality of food served in this location is terrible! I have eaten here several times, unfortunately, since it is in a good location across from the mall. A good meeting place it may be, but it is a horrible place to eat. I always wondered if the beef used for their burgers was grade D? The burgers are prison-food grade, I would honestly think you could get a better burger at a McDonald's drive-thru. The fries are terrible and taste like they came from a frozen bag of crinkle-cut fries from Wal-Mart (which is conveniently right next door). The salads are awful. Even the iced tea is of poor quality. The restaurant is dirty, the bathrooms are dirty, the space is dingy and needs to be steam cleaned from floor to ceiling. In the year 2016, this was the worst restaurant I ate at in the US, I travel frequently and eat at hundreds of different restaurants during the course of a year, and my friends and I always tell stories of how bad this Red Robin is!

The sea food scatter is really good too however it's inconsistent sometime being over fried. Their ghost pepper sauce is really good plus endless fries will ensure you are full. The bar makes some good drinks & even have some nice unique ones however the drink menu is too limited on mixed drinks.

Kayluh D.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,31,7,4.0,1/5/2016,"Came in on New Years day (around 645) with a party of 7, we were seated quickly, however we were given a corner booth, which honestly sucked. There really wasn't a whole lot of room to seat 6 dudes and 1 girl (me) comfortably. (We also gained 1 more further into our stay, which made it more squished) There looked to be tables that could have been put together with a long booth on one side. We would have waited a few more minutes to have been seated comfortably. That is why I am taking a star off. Accurately place your patrons, please. Also some of the locks on the stalls in the bathroom are pretty janky and can be pulled open while it's locked. I think it was the handicap stall, might want to check that out. Our waitress was awesome. She handled the crazyness of us with ease. I'm sure she was pleased when we left but she never showed it (; I forget her name, I want to say it started with a K, younger blonde.  She brought plenty of refills for the dudes without anyone asking. And for ONCE in my life at a RR location (I frequent RR a lot) my BLT has REAL and MULTIPLE strips of bacon on it!! I didn't have to ASK for real bacon strips. For a 14+$ sandwich I should not be recieving bacon crumbles that are gone within two bites of the sandwich. Kudos to the kitchen. Great job waitress for being very attentive to us and our needs and for putting up with my 'unique' group. Ha ha. Manager or assistant manager came to our table to check up on us and bring extra fries. Super personable, made jokes and conversation with us  Great time we had.

I love the fries so it's one thing my heart is set on when coming here. The fries were not cold but definitely not hot. I asked for hot fries which I just hate doing because I feel like a difficult customer. New fries came and on first try they were hot but as I ate there were more warm ones. I feel like they just give you fries that have been sitting around under heat lamp mixed in with a few fresh ones so they can get rid of old ones. Yuck. That kind of ruined the whole thing for me. The sever was nice. She may have got a little distant when I asked for fresh fries but was nice when closing out. I feel like none of my issues are because of her. It just makes me wonder how long before I'll come back. P. S. The burger was super good and spicy like I like it. Just one odd thing....

K. G.,"Chandler, AZ",3,17,,2.0,10/21/2015,"I've been eating at Red Robin since it first opened in Az. , and always had a great meal. But lately, I've had a lot if trouble just trying to get a table. One time I  arrived with no one waiting,  but also no host in site. Must have waited 10-15 minutes for a host: even though waiters passed the area frequently. Took another 10 minutes before I was seated; despite plenty of seating. Other times I have encountered several groups of people at the door waiting for a host. Instead if taking down info of other groups, the host walks away to check what seating is available. The host then sets the table and comes back to seat the party. This took about 5-10minutes to look and set up another 10 minutes to seat and return to the front. Other waiting guests have to stand in a crowded door way.  This last time there were four groups waiting. Host wasn't around. I asked how long people had been waiting. ""Forever"" was the answer. People were asking the obvious question why is there only one person during dinner, and where is the manager? Every incident there was only one host during peak meal time. Other staff running around but no one helps. Where's the GM?  More people arrive,  but me and another group left. It concerns me when staff is cut down. Went to another restaurant and got seated immediately. Won't be wasting my time trying to eat at this location.

They took an entree off of our tab, but left the other three customers with us paying for food we expressed our displeasure with.

Chris S.,"Tempe, AZ",298,569,1415,2.0,6/13/2012,"I don't know what went wrong with this place. The many times we have been here before the service was great now it has slowly gone downhill. One waitress we had a few occasions ago was excellent. She was friendly, took our order in a reasonable time, brought us sauces in adequate amounts (I hate it when they give you a dinky portion that you know you're just going to end up asking for more soon), we never needed to flag anyone down and she came over frequently but not too frequently to see if we were doing okay. The last few times were terrible. I think this is either the result of inadequate management or disorganization by everyone. Possibly both, okay I must watch too many Kitchen Nightmares or something. One time we were seated to the right of the restaurant when you come in, by the bar area. A girl came and took our drink orders, myself partaking in an endless root beer float (only a little over $3 I might add) and my partner ordering a margarita. Some time passed (10 min) and then we had to flag someone down to get them to bring us our drinks. Margarita was disappointingly small for the price but root beer float was fabulous as usual, they forgot the spoon which also had to be flagged down for. Ordering time comes which was during the span of time waiting for drinks and so forth. Food takes awhile to come out, meanwhile the waitress is serving as the bartender for the whole restaurant making drinks one after another while waiters whiz by in and out carrying drink orders and we are left wondering when can we get a refill and where is our food? Food finally comes and someone else brings it and we discover my partner's food is cold. Sent it back and it comes back better but the whole experience was aggravating, no set server for a table and to keep flagging down people for things. It was like the equivalent to being seated next to the bathroom or kitchen, forgetful service and confusing, crowded and busy servers rushing by. The next time we came they tried to sit us there again! We replied with a resounding NO and the girl looked very ""butthurt"" for lack of a more flavorful word. We explained why but she didn't seem to be too concerned. We sadly looked at the people who were sitting in that area, aware of the service they were about to receive. Finally we ended up where we wanted to sit and the server was just okay, not very friendly. I hate it when I look at other tables in a restaurant and I see their servers are way more friendlier than mine and then I end up having ""server envy.""  Summary: weekends are very crowded, if you are only two people they might try to stick you in the ""forgetmenot"" area. Families and larger groups they seem to move to the main dining area as I noted. I think I'm just going to find another location. Although I dislike chains mostly, Red Robin is a decent place to grab a burger $8-11 and don't forget those bottomless fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=60

We stopped by for lunch today and got the same friendly service I always get. I ordered the grilled chicken salad over fresh greens with a honey mustard dressing. Everything was fresh and quite flavorful and I would not hesitate to order this again. In fact the portion of salad was so big that I ended up taking half of it with me.

Erica M.,"Tempe, AZ",71,13,4,1.0,1/7/2015,"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED for the last time at this location. I love Red Robin. I eat here probably once a month. The other evening my fiancé and I came in for dinner, and surprisingly it wasn't packed like we expected. Our waitress was absolutely terrible. I don't know if she was having a bad day or what, but she took forever to bring us our drinks, forgot to bring us plates for our appetizers (even reminded herself and still forgot), checked on us maybe ONCE the entire time.... just awful. She was catering to other customers (we assume), but she would completely walk past our table every time we saw her. A younger boy who I guess helps bring out the food was more prompt than her. He brought us extra fries, napkins, even checked on us to see how we were doing! We ended up tipping him and just left her a few dollars. I understand if you're having a bad night, you may be off your game, but holy shit at least come by and let us know you're busy, if that's even the case. Oh and another thing- the manager took his time going to every table to ask how their meal was, except for us. Is it because we are a younger couple? Honestly I have noticed since we are in our late 20's, we receive shit service. Regardless of age, we are respectful, easy going, tip generously, but I guess that's not enough.

The kids love it and we enjoy it too. However maybe a year or more ago Red Robin corporate decided to ""improve"" their menu to make it appear more gourmet and offer more ""fancy"" sauces. All they ended up doing was increasing prices and lowering food quality and consistency. Now this location has decided to remodel as a desperate step to become ""hip and cool."" The service has been horrible the last few times we have been here. Inexperienced and rude waiters and slow service. The food is just okay or not good (soggy tasteless hamburger buns are now standard). And the ""bottomless"" fries are served in piles of about 8 and then it takes the server a good 20 minutes to bring you 8 more fries. I bet they are saving all kinds of money on the fries.

Update: 11-21-13 I went back today for a late lunch, of course very few people in the restaurant and service was what one would hope and expect. Why isn't it great service all the time. Many of my friends that I told about the very poor initial service ALL stated to a person that their service us simply MISERABLE but they do like their burgers.

I moved down to Arizona about 15 years ago, and I started visiting the Red Robins down here. I loved every minute; there was a perfect combination of bottomless steak fries and a unique atmosphere. But the last few years the quality of service has declined exponentially. The most recent time I went, something was different. Red Robin decided to install these bullshit ""Ziosk"" tablets on each and every table. What ever happened to enjoying small talk and interacting with other human beings? Even in the last 5 years with the introduction of the smartphone our social patterns have been warped. With the installation of these devices you no longer have to talk to the server. It's disappointing to see such a wonderful place of gathering spoiled by technology.

Carina M.,"Seattle, WA",273,983,177,4.0,5/28/2008,"I love Red Robin's all you can eat fries -- too bad I can only consume the ones that come with my meal. I have good memories of Red Robin -- my college days when we'd go to the Red Robin out in Daly City and split burgers and gorge on the fries. When I left San Francisco for Las Vegas the last meal with my friends from the Bay Area was at Red Robin. I'm glad that no matter where I have been there has been a Red Robin to eat at. I get moments where I must have their bacon cheeseburger. I fiend for their fries. My only universal complaint about Red Robin is that it is freaking LOUD in there. I mean the kind of loud that is so obnoxious that I feel I have to take some aspirin. But what I do see everytime are happy smiling faces from their customers. They must be doing something right! Food can be a bit salty because they put their seasoning on *everything* (I half expected it to be in my ice tea, too) - and their seasoning contains MSG. So being the fussy girl that I am, I always ask that absolutely zero seasoning be put on my food. Yea, call me a killer of fun, but would you rather spend time with me eating and laughing or watching me be carted off in an ambulance to the nearest emergency room? What I also love about Red Robin is their strawberry shake...I haven't had one in a long time, but I know that if I even have one drop, I won't be able to stop. I will want strawberry shakes until I die. So I try to take a sip off of friends' shakes...which usually turns into a brain ache slug that leaves them with more whipped cream than shake.  :D  Oops, my bad! I really do love their chocolate malts, too. That is such a wonderful dessert. I've found service at this particular Red Robin to be extremely attentive and friendly.

Doc H.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,76,11,2.0,6/15/2014,"So disappointed. The burger was nothing like the photo. Why is this called a gourmet burger????? Bottomless fries but the staff never comes back after delivering the initial order. Water glasses empty, fries empty, right under an air conditioning vent. We were so excited to try this place and it was a total bust. Hope you have a better experience. I will not be rushing back to this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=100
Aileen B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",2492,894,5871,4.0,7/24/2009,"Had the new roast beef with au jus sandwich.  I was able to sub a caesar salad for the default bottomless fries.  Server was friendly and understanding as I had a few questions for her before I could order.   The fourth star was for the complimentary birthday sundae that was waiting for me when I had arrived back from a visit to the restroom.  Now why would I rate an extra star for this, you ask?  Since I actually paid for the meal with a birthday coupon, I had not expected the complimentary sundae.  Quite thoughtful of the server, I thought, and this act garnered her a few more dollars in tips!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=100
Tiffany W.,"Phoenix, AZ",18,49,1,1.0,3/6/2014,Service is always horrible. A female server was training a new guy and she was very rude. Still tipped her good regardless of her rudeness. Food is always well prepared and tasty but the service could be much better.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=100
E R.,"Cocoa Beach, FL",13,56,,1.0,11/6/2011,"Did i really just pay 13.29 for this pathetic sandwich? the ""prime rib dip"" looked so good on the menu, but what showed up at my table was a weak, dried up little sandwich, with no flavor, chewy overcooked meat, and served on what was nothing more than a tiny, hard oversized breadstick. our waitress annie, while pleasant enough, seemed unconcerned with the fact that i only took one bite out of this sandwich before pushing it aside, and DID NOT want a to go container. i dine out a lot, and this was possibly the worst most overpriced thing i've been served in a long time. The ""game day nachos"" were almost equally sad. at 8.99 they came with just a handful of chips and the same gross ""cheez-whiz"" style sauce you squirt on your nachos at the local 7-11. disgusting the rest of my party seemed ok with their burgers, even though my son ate less than half of his, and also did not want a to go container. at $65 for 3 people ($78 with tip) this was a completely dissatisfying and overpriced meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=100
Debbie C.,"Chandler, AZ",3,26,3,5.0,3/26/2014,"I love their garden burgers.  Did u know u can substitute with a garden burger for any of their gourmet designer burgers?  And can't say enough about all u can eat fries !  Normally I don't go for flavored teas, but I'm addicted to the pomegranate tea.  Very flavorable and just a little bit tart, really refreshing. And the staff are all very friendly and super professional.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=100
Jim W.,"Los Angeles, CA",848,1639,816,3.0,1/29/2009,"It's not that I don't like burgers. I just need to be in the mood for a burger. Last night when I went to Red Robin I wasn't. Why the hell did you go to Red Robin you say? I had a left-over gift card to use, ok?  So I went with a veggie burger prepared like one of their  ""signature"" burgers. It had melted cheese, bourbon sauce and onion straws. Of course it came with fries. I didn't finish the veggie burger and it didn't sit well with me. Oh well. Good try.  The service was outstanding and garnered a nice tip by the way.  So for this visit, 2 stars. I did have a burger here several months ago and it was pretty good. 3 stars for that visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=100
Kevin O.,"Chandler, AZ",37,37,4,3.0,3/17/2013,"We were in the mood for a burger with my daughter and her friend so we went here.  We ordered apps and about 5 minutes later, our entree.  Apps came out quick and were pretty decent (jalapeno coins, onion rings and chips).  However, right on the heels of the apps came the entree's.  We had just started on the apps so the table was jam packed with food and dishes.  Take a tip and delay ordering your entree on a busy night.  They were clearly about turning tables, but the server was pleasant and not pushy.  I ordered the ""burning love"" burger.  Definitely not as hot and spicy as the description made it out to be, but decent which sums up the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=100
Suzanne S.,"Phoenix, AZ",37,91,,3.0,6/22/2011,"Its what you expect, burgers and fries. But wait, there is more now.  There are sweet potato fries.  Yes, you heard it here first - sweet potato fries - yum. I find the drinks fun to look at and yummy to drink but a bit on the pricey side. Here's another great hint - they have smaller portion burgers!  I can never finish the whole regular burger so this is a great deal. Comfortable easy place to be.  Someday I'll save room for dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=100
Amanda S.,"Phoenix, AZ",69,153,,4.0,10/4/2010,"DH and I went here after I got sucked in by the Mt. Olympus burger commercials on TV.  Neither of us had been to one before, so we figured we might as well try it out. Our experience was good - we had a good waitress who was attentive.  She knew when to bring refills, when to stay away, and was a psychic when it came to knowing when my hubby needed napkins.   I also want to mention the experience of a couple sitting nearby.  She had ordered a turkey burger and did not find it to her liking.  They offered to bring something else out to her immediately, for free.  They also offered to keep refilling her fries - for free.  They offered her a free dessert, a free shake - free ANYTHING.  The waitress and then the manager. I have seen some negative reviews about the customer service at this place - so I just want to mention:  If something bothers you, mention it.  I would be willing to bet they fix it.  Immediately. We both enjoyed our food, had a pleasant dining experience, and got to overhear how we would have been treated had we not been happy.  Solid 4-star experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=100
Marty F.,"Scottsdale, AZ",265,314,13,5.0,11/4/2010,"Old Reliable...  That's what our family calls this place.   When we cant think of a new place to eat when we go our, or everyone is arguing about this place or that place, we always say ""Ok, well lets go to Red Robin..""   Ive been here at least 20 times, and every time I go, it just gets tastier.  I mean, what place offers all-you-can-eat fries?  Steak fries!..  Funny though, even knowing I can have more than one basket, I get just one..  If you want good service, use Tim.  He rocks and is usually serving the tables in the middle or the booths just next to them.  What to get? I love their Royal Red Robin burger.  Call me traditional, but how awesome is it that you have a hamburger with a fried egg on it?  Gross you say? Ohhh just the opposite, mouth watering delicious.   If you are in to wings, they have these amazing dry rub wings that just bite you back.  Id get a ton of them if they were cheaper..  Also if you love Root beer floats, get ready because for $3.00  you can get all-you-can-drink floats.  How cool is that? I love their iced tea.  All I drink when I go out is iced tea and Red Robin has some of the best out there. Ugg.. i feel like going there for lunch now .  Damn you Red Robin!!  Maybe this weekend!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=100
Kayla A.,"Chandler, AZ",4,10,2,5.0,8/18/2013,My mom and I went here for lunch not too long ago and we were enjoying our talks and our drinks. We had already ordered and were just waiting for it to be boughten out. When it did come out the manager himself came and talked to us saying the food took too long to cook. We didnt notice nor cared. But he said it didn't meet standards so our whole meal was free. It was a pleasant dining experience and I will definitely be back more,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=100
Nicholas H.,"Queen Creek, AZ",0,3,,2.0,11/30/2013,Disappointing location. The one on Cooper and Baseline is much better. The fries were mealy and salt deprived. The Royal Burger fell apart and the meat didn't have much flavor and was excessively salty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=100
