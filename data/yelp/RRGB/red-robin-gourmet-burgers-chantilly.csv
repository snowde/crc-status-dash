Joann M.,"Reston, VA",133,124,574,1.0,4/15/2017,Sorry Red Robin but you have lost us as customers after today's visit.  We stopped in BECAUSE you have rootbeer floats.  However hubby wanted ice cream instead of soft serve.  We were willing to pay more ur order rootbeer AND ice cream on the side.  However we were surprised when our waiter told us that over a month ago you all did away with your french vanilla ice cream.  In addition he went into comment that when someone does order ice cream they take the soft serve and toss it in the freezer to turn it up..... sorry but just cause it's hard that doesn't make it ice cream.  No where on your menu did it indicate anywhere you were doing this substitution on the deserts that advertised ice cream.  A label would have done the trick till it was time to do a menu reprint.   It's one thing to not have something in stock.... it's another to just substitute a different product from what is advertised.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly
Elizabeth W.,"Fairfax, VA",211,594,214,3.0,3/20/2017,"Red Robin has become a ""default"" restaurant for me since moving to the 'burbs. I tried this location on 3/4/17 with my husband.  Although the menu and décor is similar to other Red Robin's, this location has one very distinct difference. It caters to children (and families). The waiting room has chalkboards for kids to play with and the servers seemed to be prepared and ready with the high chairs.  I had the salmon sandwich. It wasn't great and I don't plan on ordering it again. It was basically a piece of fish on a bun with little to no sauce. (If I go back I will go back to my ""usually"". I enjoy their veggie burgers with a fried egg.)  In a nutshell, this is a great option if you have a family that you'd like to take out for dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly
Jina Y.,"Chantilly, VA",109,156,164,2.0,11/13/2017,"It's been a long time since I've been here. We went because they were offering free tavern burger and bottomless fries for Veterans Day. My boyfriend had the burger and I ordered the wrap and soup combo. I got the chicken Caesar wrap and chicken tortilla soup. The wrap was ok... it was just chicken, Cesar dressing, lettuce, and tomato. I felt that it could've used a little more Cesar, but that's just me. The chicken tortilla soup was good, but the tortilla chips on top came out soggy so I'm wondering how long has it been sitting there or how bad are their tortillas? The soup was somewhat flavorful, but all in all it was just ok. I remember they had a ramen burger for their new special and that was terrible. I just don't think I like their burgers very much. They try to do too much and sometimes simple is the best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly
Joanne F.,"Fairfax, VA",437,204,660,4.0,6/13/2016,I came here with the kids so a surprise dinner.  We had about a 5 minute wait.  We were sat at a table where my son could watch the basketball game and he was thrilled.  The kids could also see into the kitchen from our seats so they were guessing when our food was coming out. My daughter's meal came out incorrectly but the server quickly fixed it.  She ate her entire bowl of mac & cheese.  My son inhaled his meatballs and apple slices. My burger came out and it was perfect.  I used my app to count my calories and was able to eat half of my burger and 7 french fries and I had a meal for the next day's lunch (minus the fries because they are gross when reheated).

Keegan Z.,"Richmond, VA",88,225,672,3.0,7/31/2016,"While much of what I wrote before still stands, there has been a significant turnover in both serving staff and management. This is common in chain restaurants, though usually good hiring procedure results in a pretty standard quality of service. This has not been the case here, with service times increasing greatly and managers being more about explaining why things are going wrong rather than by finding solutions for those issues.  As a final thought, I would err on the side of clarifying your coupons before using them here. I was given a hard time about the last one I tried to use, despite it being seemingly eligible for the purchase I was making. Go figure.

Mark R.,"Summer Shade, KY",18,10,,1.0,5/24/2017,"After a previously bad experience with this particular restaurant I risked another chance with them and was disgustingly disappointed.  I picked up a salad to go yesterday and took it back to work. After eating nearly half the salad I pulled a very long blondish colored hair out of my mouth!  Ugggh  Was barely able to keep what I'd already eaten down.  No, I did NOT call or go back as they would have only offered me free food on future visits and trust me, there will not be any future visits to this place.  One bad experience is an accident, but two bad experiences is unacceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly
KT A.,"Ashburn, VA",0,32,1,1.0,10/30/2016,"It was sooooo bad! that I walked out. Floors and tables was not clean and greasy. Waited a long time before waiter came to table to take drink orders. His communication was bad and he was rude to my mom and niece. And we never got our food as we waited 20 min and continued to watch for a few more minutes as people who came in after us received their food.

Melissa D.,"Fairfax, VA",153,223,175,2.0,1/5/2015,"Driving down the street an eye catching ""gourmet burgers and beers"" sign grabs our attention..little did we know it was Red Robin, nicely played- you got us! We decided since we were already in the parking lot and would probably never decide to come again that we would give it a shot. Yeaaaaah, definitely a once in a blue moon type deal. We were greeted by a young lady at the host stand that looked like she'd seen better days- I think she was sick, you know that face that you can't hide when you feel so under the weather? Poor girl, I wanted to send her home myself. The atmosphere itself was just odd- it felt kind of sad in there, I'm not sure how else to describe it.  We were seated in the bar area at a high table and told our server would be right over...10 minutes passed and still nothing- we decided to move to the bar. One of my biggest pet peeves is when someone says ""huh?"" when they've misheard you- as an industry worker (as I myself have been) you never say ""huh?"" to your guests (or anyone..grr) so that put me off a little. That being said, our bartender was nice but the bar itself seemed to be lacking some essentials, such as half sized beer naps you get pretty much every other place you go- ours were the long napkins which she folded in half- not a big deal, just seemed odd. We spent a few minutes browsing the menu; sooo many things but nothing that jumped out. We got a half order of the onion rings, they were decent; we were half way through our half order when our food arrived..it wasn't timed right at all. We got the whiskey bbq river burger meduim (it was cooked medium well) and the California chicken club (I was craving quac). Neither were very impressive or too ehh; the burger however would have been much better had it been cooked to the temperature we ordered it. We were also charged extra for a dipping sauce we wanted to try with the onion rings, our bill came out to almost $40, not thrilled. Overall it was one of those experiences you look back on and think, I didn't miss anything by coming and I sure won't miss anything not coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly

Matthew S.,"Washington D.C., DC",15,177,49,4.0,8/1/2016,Red Robin is slowly upping their game - they are expanding their menu with more unique burger/smokehouse/brewpub options and have a greater craft beer selection to entice the patrons. Luckily they still have the unlimited fry refills and bottomless beverages. I'm a fan of the five alarm burger with jalapeno coins and chipotle aioli.

Ted M.,"Manassas, VA",81,48,458,4.0,4/28/2016,"I have not been here in a couple of years, as the kids picked this place for dinner, and I was pleasantly surprised. We walked in to a bustling atmosphere, and our party of three was seated right away.  Our waitress arrived shortly thereafter and took our drink order, explained the menu and offered suggestions on appetizers (I always like this as they have the inside scoop).   Our first dinner item was the Red's Tavern double burger with a side of fiery ghost pepper sauce and garlic herb fries.  The burger was juicy and had lots of flavor and the ghost pepper sauce was just the right amount of kick.  The garlic fries are addicting-ly yummy and I could have made a meal on that alone.  And, the fries are bottomless! The little one ordered the kids cluck-a-doodles and fries.  She, seemed to enjoy them. I ordered the Avo-Cobb-O, and Oh was it good!  The mixed greens were fresh and very crisp, hard-boiled eggs, bacon, bleu cheese, avocado and grilled chicken was delicious.  I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner selection. Our waitress was on point with accuracy, smiles and speed.  If you haven't been in a while, give it a try again as I was impressed for this type of restaurant, plus it's easy on your wallet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly
Michael K.,"Centreville, VA",65,373,1035,2.0,9/9/2015,"Showed up before noon on a weekday with a group of eight from work and found the place already almost full. We didn't wait long though to be seated outdoors at two four tops pushed together. Strategy on my part avoided me having to sit at the crack between the tables. The host didn't have enough menus for everyone and promised to return with more (never did).  The first sign of lackluster service to appear.  Our server finally appeared to take our drink and app orders. He would disappear though for long periods of time perhaps because he also had some inside tables to serve? We ended up having an Executive style 90 minute lunch hour due to this slow service.  Fortunately the food (when it finally showed up) was hot, fresh and delicious. I tried something different this go around ordering their regular burger wrapped in lettuce in an effort to recover some calories I burned on a couple of their yummy onion rings as an app. Turned out to be delicious albeit a bit messy. I paired it with broccoli to go even more healthy. If my wife was with we would have split one of their awesome shakes.  I would give them three stars for the food but the service was so lame that I had to mark them down for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly

Ali N.,"Bethesda, MD",72,2,,5.0,9/25/2016,I like the quality of service. Their chef makes sure that you get the quality you want. His name is Walter. I am a picky person and I specifically asked to make sure about the ingredients of what I ordered. He stepped out of the kitchen and answered all my questions. The food was in excellent quality. I understand that the quality of service is the collective efforts of all people working in a restaurant. But I believe that the quality of food is the main criteria people will comment on.

Stinky C.,"Alexandria, VA",25,38,5,1.0,9/1/2015,"This is one of those - if I could go lower than 1 star - I would. I wrote the review during the boring an frustrating wait, while the vast amount of staff avoided my looking around for assistance. You know, the fixed looking ahead and avoiding eye contact with the person trying to get somebodies attention. Even though it's early afternoon and the place isn't really that packed. Anyway When I get to pay, it's a novel little card swipe screen device one on each table. Mine wasn't working, and the server who eventually returned to my table brought me another one. I swiped my card, and the display showed what I had ordered. Then it gave me the option of adding a tip. A sliding scale on a touch screen. Ahhh the American tipping protocol, well I'm not American and I don't have a problem in lowering the tip if the service has been wanting. So, I move the slide to 15%. The machine throws up an ERROR screen. I start over, and it does it AGAIN, one more time and ERROR. So, I try once more leaving it the 20% mark that it suggests. SURPRISE it works. THIS IS A CON TO MAKE YOU TIP AT A RATE YOU DO NOT WISH TO.  I, for one will never go to a Red Robin again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly?start=20

When they were wrapped up, they were so easy to eat. Now they arrived on a plate, with a small cup of fries. They are messing to eat.

Debi M.,"Centreville, VA",0,39,6,1.0,2/13/2016,Went in at 4 o'clock on Saturday the hostess Brenda had 11 people in line when we were seated we were third in line there were 26 empty tables.In between seating each group of people she would walk around the restaurant and talk to people then go back and seat people.    Natalie was our waitress. They brought out our burgers before they brought out our appetizer. Our burgers were not made the way we asked for them. I feel this place is becoming more of a bar than a restaurant.    I used to enjoy bringing my kids here now I feel it is more of a bar atmosphere. The servers basically give you exactly what is on the menu and if you asked to add or subtract an item from a burger good luck.    Since I really like their food I think I will try  there Fair Lakes location.

Amy R.,"Herndon, VA",14,151,35,4.0,1/8/2015,We like Red Robin.  It's a solid burger most of the time.....bottomless fries (not that you need to be eating all those fries) and they will bring some out as an appetizer if you ordered a burger!  No need to order an appetizer if you are starving!   Variety of burgers is huge.....veggie and turkey burger are really good there if you are interested in that.   They only cook burgers through so you can't get medium rare - which I like - but I can live with that.  They are still juicy and tasty.   Salads are pretty good there too as well as the chili but if I am going there I ususally stick with a burger.  They have a thing with all these sauces you can choose from - not sure I am a real fan of those.  I  stick to what comes on the burger and sometimes we ask for ranch and/or honey mustard for the fries. I am also a fan of the Red Robin seasoning they have on the tables.  Sprinkle some on the fries - yum!  If you really like it - ask to buy some......it's great on steak and burgers at home - chicken too!

The parking lot was packed; it was lunch time, so I knew the inside was bound to be a mad house.  They were packed, like... we got the last table packed. The server was prompt and had our drinks for us immediately.  We had an 18 month old with us and she quickly had the children's menu there so we could get his lunch ordered first. The service was good.  Order was taken correctly and our drinks stayed full.  That is leaps and bounds above Manassas already. I ordered the Bonzi Burger.  It was yummy and done exactly the way I wanted. Pro's... they stopped wrapping the burgers in that white paper.  I was never a fan of that.   It served no purpose and just got in the way.  Glad my food just comes on a plate now instead of a ""to go"" wrapper in a plastic basket. Con's... not really a con, just annoying... the fries, they are amazing!  And they give you like eight of them with your burger.  I know they are bottomless, but I don't want to have to sit and wait 12 minutes for more.  Put some damn fries on the plate!

Solace C.,"Clarksburg, MD",56,381,4,4.0,5/27/2014,"okay so im out with my friends and I ask so where does everyone wanna eat at? and they all chirp RR! As if my life couldnt get any worse. Of all the eateries out there including the dreaded Olive Garden or Red Lobster ( dirty rachet lobster) they insisted on this place. Usually I have bad memories of RR, no matter where I go, so here I was expecting worse. Much to my surprise, the employees were all sane, happy and actually working and not waiting for their Iphones to flash. So we get seated, they we get our waiter, who was nice, gets our drinks fast. We ordered wings and chips...by all means, just get wings by itself do not eat those nasty $1.00 walmart type chips... We get our wings, nice and crispy but who in their right mind heats up chips and drowns them in buffalo sauce? where they do that at? tell me honey!! Okay, so the appetizers were a little on the womp womp side. but the burgers were good. not great, as I notice that the burger patties are shrinking. they use to slice your burger in half, just so you can see the middle, now it seems they dont so they can hide their tracks, i guess. the burgers are okay. A little stingy on fries but its bottomless and here they will refill and not play games or make you wait unlike in MOCO were ...um... well just go back and read my old reviews of RR. I give this place 4 stars for the food, 5 stars for our waiter, he was on point. refills without being asked, napkins, hauling our dirty dishes as we eat, just on point with everything. we had an issue with our bill and the lovely manager was on point, and handled it every well, she was very apologetic and sincere. overrall, this was a painless experience minus the buffalo chips.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly?start=40

Warren M.,"Arlington, VA",0,2,,1.0,6/11/2014,"Terrible Service can ruin everything! Let me follow be saying; I am a fan of Red Robin.  I love their food, the feel of their establishments and the overall experience of going.  I've been to several RRs in my area and never had a complaint that warranted a negative review or a complaint period.  Until I visited this particular location. I was headed to Chantilly with my mother to visit a friend and remembered passing by this location several times in the past.  So last night was the perfect time to grab a bite to eat.  The parking area is fairly small for the number of guests it can seat inside. But nothing to lose my head over.  When we entered, it didn't appear to be as busy as the parking lot suggested, we were greeted immediately by a very courteous host and seated by the bar.   Red flag one:  We were seated at a four person table; when we clearly saw two-seaters available.  But again, I just assumed that no servers were working that section; so I let it go. Red Flag two: Our waitress, who finally arrived 10 minutes later was also the bartender.  Which means she was filling orders for the bar, making the drinks and taking orders from the bar as well as the main dining area and the outside patio adjacent to the bar. Meanwhile there were other servers in that area, that could have been more attentive. We ordered our drinks (Freckled Lemonade and a Milk Shake).  Red Flag three:  The lemonade is $3.99 w/ free refills. Not once throughout the evening did the waitress ask if a refill was needed and the Shake was 3/4 filled with the rest of the glass filled with whipped cream.  (On an unsanitary note: One guy working the bar; probably a manager of some type by what he was wearing; after filling a drink order used his fingers to clean the inside of a glass that he just filled with beer). Once we finally got our orders in, it was the kitchen's turn. Red flag four: After more than 20 minutes of waiting for two burgers; one of which that was cooked medium, the food finally arrived.  However, this was still after two other tables (table of 2 and 3); that were sat and ordered after us; received their food.  I guess the wait staff was also responsible for bringing out the food for the tables they were helping; which is unorthodox considering all that she was doing and the other staff there.    The food thankfully was cooked wonderfully.  The only small issue was one of the burgers was missing bacon, but that was quickly corrected.  The main reason to go to RR did not disappoint. Excellent burgers (Guacamole Bacon and Bacon Cheese). Following the meal, the server came and got our plates off the table; which was the fastest thing she did the whole time.  Next came another 20 minute wait for the check in which time our server completely disappeared from sight. We did not see her for the rest of the night. We had to grab another server in order to get the check at which time we asked to speak to a manager.  The waiter tried to smooth things over by removing our drinks, but it was far too late for that. Afterwards we were greeted by a ""Manager in Training"" who took off 50% for the inconvenience. Needless to say this is one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had; which is so hard to say for an establishment that I've never had to complain about until now.  This will not deter my RR visits in the future, only to this particular location and its horrible service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly?start=40
Eli L.,"Herndon, VA",401,161,5,4.0,10/10/2014,"It may be a bit hard to categorize Red Robin. Is it a ""better burger"" chain like BGR or Five Guys? Or is it best thought of as a casual sit down place like Friday's or Ruby Tuesday? Either way, the chain as a whole and this location in particular are good, generous, and well prepared...service is friendly and competent if not always as speedy as it could be. (I suspect actually, that there's a trade off here, a reasonably low priced menu won't generate many tips unless each server has an above average number of tables.) The tavern burgers, Royal Red Robin Burger, and Milkshakes ar all great. The unlimited refills on many sides (salad, fries etc) are great of you are hungry.

I later heard there were a number of parties but that didn't make me feel any better.  When I finally got my burger it was made wrong.  I won't be back anytime soon.  Why have only one server for over 30 people?  Finally I think the people who didn't preorder got their food faster.  They should change the name of this place to Dead Robin.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly?start=40

They have a full bar so they do serve liquor which is just what you need when hungover.  They make a great Cadillac Margarita (Patron and Grand Marnier).  I got one of their signature burger and steak fries which was delicious.  Huge portions and at a reasonable price. The highlight of this place is our waiter, James.  He provided such exceptional service and was very friendly & polite.  He was also very helpful with the area and even gave us detailed directions to a few places we wanted to go to.  I think if he was going on break he literally would've drove us.  That's how above and beyond this kid went.  Big ups to James, the margarita and that Guacamole Burger with Bacon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly?start=40

The servings are big and because of the endless fries, I don't think you will leave hungry. What I like about this place is the full blown kids menu where my niece and nephew had choices of their entree and their side and their drink which was nice. It's a pretty typical menu for adults. I chose to go with chicken salad caprese... which was actually pretty good. It's basically salad with grilled chicken and some type of vinegrette dressing and then 3-4 huge slices of mozzarella. Yum! Not bat at all. Did i mention the endless fries? Because although the fries weren't the best thing I've tasted, they were decent enough for us to refill like 3 to 4 times. And they have the seasoning old bay type of seasoning on the table so you can have the fries as salty or as bland as you want. Why only 3 stars? Well part of any great restaurant are the servers and unfortunately our server wasn't so nice. I know it's tough work to get orders from kids, but buck up and put on that fake smile if you have to. And it's not like the kids were being too difficult, they just got a little stuck on trying to see what side they wanted and already the dude is rolling his eyes. Whoa whoa whoa... maybe he had a tough day though so I can't really complain too much, but I've worked in the restaurant business before and if you want that tip, you at least gotta smile and hold the rolling of the eyes thank you!

Bonnie C.,"Culpeper, VA",54,219,1,3.0,10/17/2012,"Last night found us in the Chantilly area around 8:30 p.m. & hungry for something good, yet quick.  ""Red Robin"" loomed up, & since neither of us had ever been to this chain before, decided to give it a try.  It was 8:30 p.m. on a Tuesday night, so guess not too surprising that except for one other table, we were the only patrons.  Husband just ordered water; I an iced tea ($2.59 with free refills) - both of which were brought promptly. Hubby ordered the ""Turkey Burger"" ($8.99 + $.99 for American Cheese).  While I'd like to quibble over the extra $.99 charge for a slice or two of American Cheese, hubby's burger was a nice thick obviously hand-formed burger, perfectly cooked.  I ordered the ""Patty Melt"", which was wonderful.  Perfectly cooked to ""medium"" burger & perfectly formed to fit on the wonderful fresh thick lightly-toasted Marble-Rye bread slices.  Burger was sandwiched between 2 slices of American Cheese & topped with a layer of perfectly sautéed sweet onions.  House-made Thousand Island Dressing was served in a decent-sized container on the side to add as one wished. Both of our orders came with their ""Endless Fries"", but frankly I'd be surprised if anyone outside of maybe children bother to ask for 2nds.  Fries are of the thick-cut ""steak fry"" variety, & in this case - as in 9 times out of 10 other places that serve this type - were hot enough temp-wise, but weren't crisp at all.  Floppy/soggy.  No wonder they offer them ""endlessly"" - probably can't get rid of them any other way - lol!   Of course, I'm a hardcore ""shoestring"" potato fry fan, so perhaps it's just personal preference rearing its ugly head.  But then, soggy is soggy. Service was excellent - prompt, friendly without being intrusive - exactly what restaurant service should be.  Bill after tax but before tip (which was generous) came to $22.64.  A definite bargain for the quality of the food. Bottom line - nice place for a casual well-prepared burger or sandwich (they offer veggie burger/sandwich options as well).  We'll definitely add this chain to our list of places worth visiting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly?start=60

We both ordered the tavern double after a minute of looking over the menu. As for drinks I ordered a bud light and my brother ordered a blue moon and the beers came to the table so fast even our server was surprised.  He was also kind enough to bring us a basket of fries to start working on.  Our food came out in less than 10 minutes and it was fantastic.  The tavern double is the classic double cheeseburger that everyone should have in mind.  The beef patties were small but they were extremely juicy and had a delicious flame broiled taste to them. The melty cheese really tops off the juicy flame broiled burgers and the burger had a seasoned aoili on it that really brought the burger together.  Overall it was a great experience and the tavern double is an excellent take on the classic american double cheeseburger.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly?start=60

I just ate whatever they brought) and said ""Why is this red light flashing??"", obviously irritated as if my son was being a pain.  I said I pushed it because you never returned and I wanted water... from there her attitude came out... acted irritated that I called her out for being rude.  We all have bad days, i get it, but that's what separates those who should and should not work in service industries.. putting on a smile.  Adding insult to injury, the bathrooms were a mess and no paper towels.  I imagine a corporate restaurant's quality control would not have been impressed.  Won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly?start=80

L. A.,"Falls Church, VA",0,20,,1.0,7/24/2014,"Warning: I'm cranky. The last few times I had been to this location, it hadn't been spectacular, but this time was a nightmare. And I really hate writing bad reviews.  We got there around 8:00. The place was probably less than a quarter full. Our server was reeeeally nice, but  didn't really know the menu.  We ordered the pretzel bites appetizer, which tasted more like salted donuts than pretzels. They were edible, but the beer cheese sauce that came with them tasted like they had mixed some Budweiser with some Velveeta.  As for the entrees...for some reason there was a long delay (20 minutes?)  between when we finished the pretzel bites and when the entrees came out, even though we ordered them at the same time. No big deal. There was a mistake with one of the entrees, and after waiting a while for our server to come back, I finally had to get up and find her to ask her to fix it. The cole slaw that came with the Clucks and Shrimp looked yellow and...goopy.  No one touched it.  The toddler in our party ordered pizza, which came with a little cup of mandarin oranges (with seeds?) on the side. The pizza looked greasy and soggy and sat at an angle in one of those red baskets so that all of the greasy cheese was slumped over to one side. The child took one bite, frowned and declared that it was ""not good"". Then he took a second bite and bit down on something hard. And that was the end of that. His hands went in to his mouth, trying to dig it out, and his face wrinkled up in a half-gag, and for a very tense minute I thought he was going to throw up. Thankfully, he did not. But he also didn't touch that pizza again. (Can't blame him.) My Bleu Ribbon burger was overcooked and was the weirdest combination of flavors I've ever had on a burger. There are few foods I won't eat if you put them in front of me, and I got less than half of it down. If I HAD to say one positive thing about this visit, it would be that the roughly 9 steak fries I was given, were hot, fresh and delicious. No, I didn't order a refill on them. No, the server never did come back after delivering our nasty food to ask how it was. Or why no one was eating.  Yes, after giving up on my burger, I don't know why, but I did ask for a To Go box. Which never came. In hindsight, that's perfectly fine with me.  Since no one really ate much dinner, someone made the questionable decision to order dessert to go, and I headed off to the restroom. I thought the night could not get worse, but I was wrong. I will spare you the details, but let's just say that they were dirty and I overheard some stuff in there that you never want to hear anywhere, let alone in a restaurant.  By the time I got back to the table, I was pretty sure I was done eating for the night.  Unfortunately, it took about 20 minutes for us to get our To Go desserts (they came out one at a time?) and our check came 5 minutes or so after that. We paid, left an 18% tip (not really sure why), and FINALLY we were free. But it wasn't over! When we got home, my party decided we should eat that dessert. (Ugh. Seriously, people?) My appetite was still shot, but in a feeble attempt to be a good sport, I forced down a couple sips of a chocolate milkshake, and a bite each of the red velvet cake and cheesecake. The milkshake was super rich, but tasted pretty good.  The red velvet cake was mushy and warm. (Why?) The cheesecake was inedible - warm and almost soupy. Our car ride was less than 15 minutes, and we had the air conditioner blasting, so I think it arrived at our table that way. It's like it had been sitting out all day.  This was the worst dining out experience I've had in at least 15 years. Or maybe ever. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly?start=80
Greg M.,"South Riding, VA",70,215,,3.0,3/6/2013,"Red Robin offers great burgers, fries and service.  Usually busy, make sure you avoid the obvious times if you are out with kids.   The service is always friendly; I've never had a problem there.  The décor is the same as always at all RRs for the last 20 years. Oriented towards kids but with great food, this copy of Red Robin has its act down.  It is efficient and has the recipes down pat.  The burgers are done to order and all the times I've asked for customizations I've never been turned down - so get what you want.  They're careful not to over-cook the burgers so don't over-compensate in your order.  Order whatever you want as your own creation or order one of their set burgers.  My very favorite is their teriyaki burger (strange that the only decent teriyaki sauce on the east coast is here - goes back to their west coast heritage).  It's easy to eat healthier here with their lighter options.  Their steak fries are just about as good as it gets - ask for some dips and try their house seasoning salt.  Two minor points of concern:  first - you can ask for garlic fries, but it seems spotty as far as when they're done well or not - I've had them pretty greasy before at this location so be prepared for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly?start=80

David K.,"Encinitas, CA",170,673,16,5.0,1/26/2009,"I consider myself a Red Robin connoisseur.  There are likely not very many that take such pride in Red Robin, but I am not ashamed.  I have now been to Red Robin 16 birthdays in a row, dating back to my 11th birthday.  It has been a streak that has taken on it's own personality, and one I don't plan on breaking.  Like an old man reminiscing about his first female conquest, I often reminisce about the first time I was introduced to the marriage of egg and burger.  The Royal Red Robin burger is still one of the finest burgers I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying.  And I am a lover of Ray's Hell Burgers, the consensus best burger of the moment.   Is it a chain?  Is it decorated like a Chuck E. Cheese on a sugar rush?  Is it full of screaming kids?  Is the flair overwhelming?  Are dinners frequently interrupted by servers singing the Red Robin happy birthday song 6 times an hour?  Is it atrociously unhealthy?  Are the arcade games dated (who plays Cruisin' USA anymore?!)?  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  Does it diminish my love for Red Robin?  Of course not.  Not when their product is so immensely satisfying, tasty, and incredible.  A veritable delight for the tastebuds.  A near smorgasborg of flavors and styles available in burger form.  An experience not to be missed. It's smart to stick to the burgers at Red Robin.  I've made the mistake of trying the Carnitas burger, as well as the pot roast burger.  There is nothing inherently wrong with either, they both were quite tasty.  But then you are faced with the opportunity cost that you potentially could have enjoyed a Royal Red Robin burger.  It is a regret that has kept me up at night.  So, I make sure to stick with a winner.  Other highlights on the menu are the Whiskey River Burger and the A-1 Peppercorn burger, as well as the Monster Burger.  The Monster Burger is a 1600 calorie behemoth loaded with cheese and a strangely magically delicious relish that makes the whole dish.  The beef used at Red Robin is not exceptional, just good, but the various burger configurations on the menu are really what make them special.   The Royal Red Robin Burger is topped with a fried egg, mayo, lettuce, tomato, cheese.  It is a real slice of heaven.  I can't recommend it enough.  I have enjoyed a Gus Burger at the White Spot in Charlottesville, what many proclaim to be the best egg-on-burger combo.  While delicious, it is perhaps 75% as tasty as the Royal Red Robin.   Red Robin also offers unlimited steak fries with all burgers/sandwiches.  I am a huge fan of steak fries, and Red Robin really hits a home run with theirs.  Perfectly cooked so it has a little bit of firmness and crisp, but doesn't overshadow the meaty nature of steak fries.  Paired with the secret blend of herbs and spices in the Red Robin seasoning provided at every table, the fries really come alive with flavor.  To top it off, there is no reason to order one of the adequate appetizers (although the towering onion rings are a spectacle to be seen) because you can request a basket of fries for free from your waitstaff.   Understanding that the target market for Red Robin is children between 6-15, I am not embarassed to say that it is my inner circle of favorite restaurants.  When my birthday comes around again, I will not be embarassed to drag my fiance and make my streak 17 years in a row(although she should be pleased I'm not choosing fancy/expensive).  I highly recommend Red Robin for all events, ranging from birthdays, children's birthdays, anniversaries, even engagements.  After all, there is no better way to say ""I want to spend my entire life with you"" then a Royal Red Robin Burger and gift of jewelery won in the crane machine located in the restaurant entryway.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly?start=80

Todd J.,"South Riding, VA",0,19,2,3.0,2/17/2008,"We like RR for a burger or other things.  It is fairly quick to get in and out, but not great for a ""real"" sit-down dinner.  As others have said, there tend to be a lot of kids and it can be very loud.  One time we had to get up and go out to the patio because of a girls soccer team party inside, with screeching and yelling.  Even my teen girls couldn't stand it! Aside from that, the service is always good.  We like the burgers OK, but my wife goes for the BLTA (Bacon Lettuce Tomato & Avacodo) Sandwich and I like their wraps.  We both like the Fish & Chips, altho sometimes they are a bit greasy.  The fries are delicious and unlimited.   We definitely recommend it if you know what to expect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly?start=100
E P.,"Herndon, VA",0,8,,5.0,5/6/2013,"Usually I don't write reviews, but this was well worth it. We had a surprise birthday party for 20 on a friday evening and the whole thing went off superbly well thanks to the wonderful staff. Our server, Andrew, was impeccable and provided prompt and courteous service the entire evening, making sure that everything was taken cared for. The only downside was that I had to arrive 30 minutes earlier to hold a table for a large group, since they don't take reservations. But all in all, I appreciate the work they took to make sure that the event went off with a hitch. I highly recommend this place for parties/gatherings. You may not get your own private room, but the good menu prices and prompt service will make it well worth it. Thanks again, Red Robin Chantilly!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly?start=100

Cindy B.,"Centreville, VA",21,183,36,3.0,9/26/2007,"I haven't been to a Red Robin in years so for nostalgia's sake I met my cousin there for lunch.  Their steak fries haven't changed at all and are just as yummy as ever.  My burger however was a bit on the salty side and the melted cheddar tasted a little plasticky.  My cousin had the mushroom burger and swears by it, I should have split it with her...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly?start=100
Dana-il H.,"Austin, TX",3,33,,3.0,9/27/2007,"Red Robin doesn't want to admit that they are the wanna be designer teenage version of a hamburger centric Shoney's.  But they are. Yes , the meal was hot and good and service was friendly and fast. When my waiter asked if I liked my meat pink or brown, I knew what to expect.  It was reasonably priced (disclaimer: robbin'  is in the name of the store) for a sit down restaurant and I came home with a balloon. The kind they use to smash the heart attack causing plaque before they insert the stent in your artery. But you know what made my ""gourmet burger"" experience even better? A costumed Woody Wood Pecker, the restaurant's lovable if copyright infringed mascot, giving me high 5's and hand shakes during my meal. Its like freaking Disney in there! Seriously tweens my waiter was right out of High School Musical.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly?start=100
Lisa C.,"Clifton, VA",22,29,1,3.0,2/19/2010,"Good food, but way too loud.  I must be getting old.  Been here probably 30 times in the last 2 years.  Lots of choices for burgers and fixin's.  Atmosphere is lively.  The music is blaring and the restaurant is usually full of business folks at lunchtime.  Not a lot of kids at lunchtime (except in summer) although this is a kid-friendly place.  As far as my experience yesterday, I couldn't hear anything my lunch partner was saying which is the usual in this location.  To add to the noise level, one of the waiters played the drums with his hands on the counter behind us.  And didn't have a very good rhythm which is why we noticed.  Did enjoy the garlic parm fries.  The chili burger was ok and could have been warmer.  I usually get a cheeseburger and onion rings which are awesome.  The paper around the burger keeps everything together.  Wish the burgers were hot with cold fixin's...the room temp burger doesn't do much for me and sometimes the burgers (the meat) have actually been on the verge of being cold.  The onion rings are usually hot and crispy though.  The queso dip was kind of like melted plastic and not very tasty.  And our service was pretty slow, but our waiter was also serving three large parties so we cut him some slack.  The menu here is different than the Fair Lakes location a few miles away.  Odd.  Really like the food but don't enjoy having to yell to have a conversation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly?start=100
S D.,"Great Falls, VA",0,14,,4.0,2/6/2008,"OK four stars for the cheeseburger and fries.   I have no idea what the rest of the menu is like (and it looks like your typical chain restaurant menu - aka not great), as I'm a creature of habit and when I find something I like, I order the same meal each time I visit.  Or rather, when I want a good cheeseburger and fries, I go to Red Robin. It is ""not"" a place with great adult ambiance (my husband and I are childless by choice) and this place is full of kids (aka - loud) but heck, it is a burger place, and that's what we go for.  We do tend to visit before and after ""kid rush hour"" so that it is quieter.   Red Robin has the level of service you'd expect at a chain restaurant (i.e. waitstaff are young and probably this is their first ever job), but again, we knew it was a chain restaurant going in. But I LOVE the fat steak fries... and the cheeseburger is nearly always scrumptious.  (once it was overcooked, but as we'd had 99% good experiences up till then, we gave them another chance, and it has been good since then.) The only other place we go for burgers is Five Guys (closer), and they have good fries too (though different - fried in peanut oil) but Red Robin tops Five Guys for burgers in our opinion (not as greasy and more flavorful.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly?start=120
Sajeev M.,"Fairfax, VA",3,4,,3.0,1/21/2011,"As a follow-up to my prior review.  I provided feedback to Red Robin through their customer feedback survey.  I was pleasantly surprised by the immediate response that I received from Red Robin.  Both the Restaurant Manager and the Regional Manager  reached out to me with their apologies. What I was grateful for the most, was the effort and time they spent wanting to learn more about my experience.  They're response assures me that the experience that I had was an anomaly and not indicative of the typical experience at Red Robin.  I appreciate their time and look forward to meeting with them in person during my next visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly?start=120
Vinnie P.,"Fairfax, VA",9,17,,5.0,4/22/2008,"This tends to be the place my group of friends ends up going whenever there's a lot of us - it's the only thing we can all agree on. Luckily, I think Red Robin is one of the best chain sit-down restaurants there is, and I'm rarely not in the mood to go there. They have a pretty big menu, but I haven't been impressed by much on it besides the burgers. But if you stick with those, you're golden, and there's enough variety that you'll probably find a couple things you really like. I've probably eaten around 25 Whiskey River BBQ burgers in my life, and I still haven't gotten sick of them.  The best part, though, is the limitless fries that come with every burger, probably the biggest reason I keep going back. Though the quality is not always consistent, most days I'd be willing to call them the best fries you can get in Fairfax. Especially with ranch on the side. I also love that I can get any burger with a Boca patty. A lot of American chain restaurants have limited vegetarian options, so this place is sort of a vegetarian boon amid the chain restaurants of suburbia.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly?start=120
