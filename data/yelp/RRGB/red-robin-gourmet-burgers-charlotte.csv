Tommy M.,"Charlotte, NC",6,17,,4.0,12/14/2017,"I've been back a couple of times since my last review, and just a few weeks ago I ate here with my sister and brother-in-law, as they both enjoy this chain. I don't go here if it's just me, but I don't mind meeting others here since it's convenient and it's not that bad. My last time was probably the most enjoyable. Granted, it might have been because I was there with my sister and her husband, but I felt like the food was better, too. I don't think I'll ever like this location as much as the one in Greensboro; when I'd eat there, I remember thinking the original gourmet burger was the bomb, whereas here it's just really good. I wanted to revise my original review, though, because I feel like this is closer to four stars now. Maybe not a solid four stars. But close. :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte
Kyle G.,"Streetsboro, OH",58,9,,3.0,12/31/2017,"If you are in the market for a charred to a crisp overdone burger this is your stop! Sadly both of our burgers were overdone to the point that any lover of a juicy medium burger would be turned off. On the up side our server spotted the lack of enthusiasm and offered us menus to choose new items. Great service, questionable burgers. Pretzel bites are  great! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte
Stephalie C.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",165,10,3,1.0,8/27/2017,I live a walking distance from this location. Which i was excited about this when i first moved it. But unfortunately i never get good service here. There is always an issue! I order online as they suggest to save time. I give them 25 mins before i arrive to sit in there 15 mins with out getting acknowledged by anyone. I had to walk to their kitchen employee line to get someones attention.  They compensate my food but the food is COLD ! The i try ordering over the phone giving them yet another chance and the lady was rude and hung up on me.  Dinning in the service is okay. Just be careful with your time when ordering online and over the phone.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte

Sheila E.,"Charlotte, NC",7,20,54,4.0,5/17/2017,"You can't go wrong with Red Robin! My family comes here a few times a month and the staff does remember us, which is great. One waitress who no longer works there knew my parents' order by heart, which they loved and now another waitress is trying to do the same thing. :) Who can beat bottomless fries? We always ask for them to bring some before the food comes since they are so yummy. I love getting them with buzzard wing sauce and ranch dipping sauce and covering them with that special spice they have on the table. My mom gets the side salad, which is also unlimited and they bring that before the food also by request. My favorite entrees are the Royal Red Robin (burger with an egg over easy on top and bacon, which I get on the side and take home for my dog) and the Crispy Chicken sandwich. I ordered the adult chicken tenders and fries and the Tavern Double one time each and I liked them both also, but not enough to choose over my favorite entrees. I got the macaroni and cheese as an additional side once, but it was very filling (it was bottomless and I still couldn't even finish half) and I'd never choose it over the fries.  I ordered the Buzz Tavern Double once and I hated it. It's a double cheeseburger with special spicy sauce and mac and cheese in between the patties. It sounds good in theory, but I don't recommend it! My dad said the same about the smoky tavern double.  Make sure to join their loyalty club because you get a free burger during your birthday month, a free entree after 10 meals purchased and coupons every week. We've gotten coupons for free appetizers before and we tried the fried pickles and the onion rings. Neither were anything special and we never ordered them again. Besides, who needs apps with bottomless fries? I'm not a big dessert person, but I ordered the birthday cake milkshake once and it was just ok. My sister likes the Cookie Magic shake. The other desserts sound good, but I've always gorged myself on too many fries to want to order them.  Red Robin is yummy, comforting and family friendly, so you have nothing to lose by stopping by when you can!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte
Tiffany H.,"1, NC",429,62,531,4.0,5/24/2017,My favorite go-to for a solid gourmet burger and bottomless broccoli and sweet potato fries!

Tiffany C.,"Monroe, NC",0,19,7,5.0,2/1/2017,Shasta was absolutely brilliant.  She knew exactly what we needed for dietary needs and assisted in ordering them. She kept up on drinks and food. Definitely deserves a pay raise.  The bathroom could use some attention. One out of three sinks worked and the locks on the stalls were broken.  Other than that the food was good. Service was great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte
Rose Z.,"Ayden, NC",0,19,,1.0,10/5/2017,I have been to many Red Robins and this is the  worst one. The servers stand around talking as the manager watching  this behavior and allows it. The service is slow and no attention to detail or customer service. You wait over ten minutes for food and drink refills. They advertise unlimited refills good luck getting them. We have been here over four times before I am leaving this review. Things have not changed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte
Kate J.,"Charlotte, NC",10,171,43,4.0,1/22/2016,"I am a Red Robin fan.  They recently gave this location a facelift, and it looks much more updated inside.  When you first come in, there is a ""21 and over only"" bar area.  We appreciate this area and enjoy eating in this section instead of the back, which is much noisier.   Appealing to adults and not only kids is helpful in my opinion!  I love the bottomless fries and of course the seasoning on the table!  My favorite burger is the Shroom burger.  The onion rings are awesome and the Mudd Pie is one of the best restaurant desserts I've had- reminds me of ice cream cake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte
Lewanna J.,"Union City, GA",0,7,,5.0,6/3/2017,Service was excellent and the food was great too!!! First time at this Red Robin.

Kyle B.,"Charlotte, NC",9,55,94,3.0,4/2/2017,"Went here on a Sunday afternoon. EXCELLENT service by the hostess(don't remember her name) Extremely friendly and kind. Sydney was our waitress. She was friendly and knowledgeable. As we spoke to her we realized that she was the bartender and also serving tables. I remember coming last time and they would use their employees in this way. As we observed her activity at the bar increased where she had to make everyone's drinks. But in doing that her attention to our table became less and less. To the point where we no longer were given refills and the bottomless steak fries were not replenished. It's not Sydney's fault, I just wish Red Robin would use their employees in a more suitable way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte
Courtney P.,"Patchogue, NY",1,9,5,4.0,11/28/2015,"I'm a fan of Red Robin.  It was one of the first places I could switch the regular burger patty with a decent veggie burger!  I'm not a fan of Boca burgers but they do have a Gardenburger which was pretty good.  I also ordered my personal favorite, towering onion rings as well as the garlic and herb fries and the nana-nana moo moo shake which was all delicious!

Wendy A.,"Charlotte, NC",8,7,,1.0,3/15/2017,"The worse experience I have ever had... Order was wrong twice, drink came with flat soda, wedge salad had brown lettuce, and fries were cold both times they were brought with my meal (never asked or given refills). When all of this was disclosed to the manager, his ONLY reply was ""Well, thanks for being patient"". Charged for grilled onions that were left off of my burger and when I informed the waitress and told her I did not want them any longer, she stated OK yet proceeded to bring them in a condiment cup anyways (probably in order to keep the charge on my bill). The bartender was MIA most of the time, server not very present as well, not to mention I had to seat myself when I came in!

Vanesa S.,"Charleston, SC",0,1,,5.0,3/1/2017,"Went there today for a bite to eat before driving home 3 1/2 hours. We were instantly greeted and the hostess even engaged in a bit of conversation. We were seated and our server didn't take long to arrive. I'm not sure of his name but he was very efficient and polite! Our food didn't take long to arrive and it was hot and fresh and they even remember to put no tomatoes. The little Ziosks on the table were a bit confusing when I wanted to pay in cash but use my Robins card for points. However the server showed me exactly how to use it. If I'm ever in the Charlotte area again, I will definitely be visiting this location again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte
Crystal J.,"Charlotte, NC",45,28,58,4.0,1/31/2016,This was my first time at this location and the food was good as usually. However this location was very busy and service was very slow.  It took my food awhile to come out and once the food was on the table it took a little longer to get my campfire (a must try) sauce to come. Although the service was ideal because the food is always on point I'll be back again and hopefully it's not too busy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte
Iyriel L.,"1, NC",1,32,13,4.0,4/7/2016,I went to Red Robins twice this past year once for my birthday and another because I wanted a good burger. The servers are always really nice.

It took about 20 minutes for our draft beers, when I questioned our server, I was told that the bar tender is very busy,when half the restaurant was empty as it was 8:30 pm. Very poor service and we were accidentally charged for chips queso and entertainment fee for my 4 year old using the kiosk.Again no warnings on the fee for using the kiosk and no record for the wrong order of chips came from the kiosk.

David H.,"Charlotte, NC",80,260,59,4.0,10/20/2015,"Camp sauce, I like it.  It has none of the heat of the Bad Daddy ketchup but the flavor is great.  I prefer the heat but not everyone does. The burgers here are better than Ruby Tuesdays and most other similar places. What really pleases me are the unlimited sides. You wanna strap on the feedback and go nuts?  You can eat fries, sweet potatoes, or brocoli.  I feel healthy after having four servings of the broc. You can take a lot if liberty with how you order your burger.  Change the cheese, add onion straws, add mushrooms, whatever.  You can't sneak in free eggs or bacon but lots of toppings. They added new touch pads to order stuff and call over a server.  The summon doesn't always work as inrended. It beats my owl eyes, where I stare st the waiter until they come over. I like it here more and more and the birthday burger doesn't hurt. Child portions are very large.  Dare I say a good value.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte?start=20

John H.,"Charlotte, NC",265,1284,687,3.0,11/30/2012,"Menu with a ton of different burgers?  Yes, please!  Unfortunately for Red Robin, it's a chain... so you can get your burger from one state to the next.  The university location seems to be fairly slow (not busy) but our server was nice enough.  We were there during peak lunch time and it was barely full.  I guess it's hard to get away from this place without dropping $12-15 dollars for lunch.  Granted it's a pretty hearty meal, but a bit expensive for lunch. The dining room is kept clean and there is plenty of nick-knacks on the walls to look at to kill the time. One thing that they have going for them is their ""special"" Red Robin seasoning, which unfortunately on my last trip was a bit solidified in the container which leads me to believe how long it has been sitting there or how NOT often they refill or keep that seasoning at it's best.  Mostly salt, but still. If you are looking for a quick lunch... I wouldn't recommend this place since it was pretty relaxed.  I could see myself getting easily annoyed if I was trying to get somewhere since our server seemed to have fair command over the section, but it felt like the getting the checks took forever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte?start=20

We watch other servers tend to their customers quickly while ours didn't. I would see her trying to blame other people for the poor service to her other tables. We were there for over two hours which is ridiculous for this type of restaurant. When we left my husband told the manager their service was horrible...his only response was ""what really??""

Nathan W.,"Corvallis, OR",10,14,,4.0,5/7/2013,"Good grief, people, it's a chain restaurant. You pretty much know what you're going to get when you come here: decent food, plenty of it, at a reasonable price. If you go in expecting the best food you've ever had, you're gonna have a bad time. Recognize that this place calls itself ""Red Robin Gourmet Burgers"" for two reasons: 90% of the people who eat here equate ""big and messy with lots of stuff on it"" with ""good burger,"" and ""Red Robin Really Big and Messy Burgers That Taste Pretty Ok"" didn't test as well with focus groups.  If you want a really good burger, go to a specialty burger joint that's not a chain. If you want a big burger loaded with a lot of flavorful things like bacon, jalapenos, avocado, and barbecue sauce, accompanied by a ton of fries and a frosty adult beverage, Red Robin would be a good choice.  Is it truly gourmet? Not hardly. Is it gourmet enough for most Americans? Definitely.  Anyway, I went to this location while in town on business. Nothing that I wasn't expecting, and just what I was looking for: a decent burger, some fries, and a frosty adult beverage on the company's dime. Service wasn't the best I've ever had but was perfectly acceptable, the food was plentiful and tasty, the beer was cold, and the company paid for it. Nothing to complain about.  In the future, folks, when you write a review of a chain restaurant, rate it according to your expectations of it as a chain, and don't try to be a food critic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte?start=20

You can get the same burger - or even a better burger - at plenty of places around town.  Not only is it not gourmet, it's not even really that good.  In fact, I'd probably rather have a burger from McDonald's.  Heck, I'd probably rather get a Chick-Fil-A than one of these things.  To make matters worse, they are horribly overpriced. And if the food and price weren't bad enough, the service is bad.  Really bad.  We went one night when there was just about no one in the restaurant, and it took 15 minutes just to get a menu (15 minutes is my cutoff, and I was just about to walk out).  Then it took nearly 30 minutes to get our burgers.  By that point, I was so hungry that we just complained and ate the food. No response whatsoever from the server or the management.  No apology, no free cheese (for which they charge extra, on top of the overpriced burger), no free dessert, nothing at all.  It's like we were troubling them for making their life more difficult.  Gourmet.  Ha!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte?start=40
Sifire M.,"Charlotte, NC",221,55,43,2.0,9/30/2012,"So I noticed that they seated all the blacks in the back where the tv's and seating is not upgraded the server ""Brandi"" had a slight attidute and the only reason she got the tip that she did was because my dad was there. they had a new item that my dad tried some roast beef sandwhich that they tried  to make fancy and was over priced. it should have been called roast beef sandwhich with a dip. it will be awile before I come back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte?start=40
Starry r.,"Charlotte, NC",6,26,1,4.0,6/2/2013,"We have been to this place on several occasions.  The latest visit was the best yet.  The waitress was really on top of everything!  The food was really delicious and cooked exactly to our specifications.  Even though this is a chain, it's one of the best burger places around!  Yum!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte?start=40
Jayson K.,"Charlotte, NC",12,75,14,1.0,12/22/2013,Very disappointed.  My girlfriend and I went in to the bar area on a sunday they where not very busy and we sat down to place a to go order.  After about 15 min of no one saying anything to us and being passed over for those of a color not of our own we decided to leave.  I love red robin but this visit has just left me with a sick feeling.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte?start=40
Zach W.,"Huntingtown, MD",3,11,,4.0,12/1/2011,"I went out on a date with my girlfriend who drove down from Maryland for Lunch. Service was above par, Both sandwiches were done well, and we enjoyed our time at Red Robin. The only complaint I had was the fact that the fries that were served with the burger were luke warm at best and I requested a new order, and received a fresh batch, hot. They were delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte?start=40
Christian F.,"Charlotte, NC",179,21,9,2.0,12/4/2011,"Some things on the menu are good. Other things not so much. Definitely overpriced, but nice for kids.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte?start=40
Greased S.,"Waterbury, CT",1,13,,4.0,7/27/2012,Ate here as a party of eight (five kids and three adults). Great service; food was what we expected.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte?start=40
Monica R.,"Charlotte, NC",0,2,,1.0,2/9/2014,My husband and I just left this place. Unbelievably filthy! They seated us at a table that had burger sauce on it and pieces of bread on the seat. I was disgusted. What made us get up and leave was the sections of tissues and fries left on the floor. I've been to a few McDonalds' that were cleaner than this. In search of a new burger joint.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte?start=40
Terry C.,"Charlotte, NC",1,47,1,1.0,7/17/2010,"Overpriced, bad service and basically not very good food.  Food ranged from average to almost inedible.  I 100% agree with Chad E",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte?start=40
Lamarr B.,"Charlotte, NC",0,8,,1.0,10/2/2013,"Normally, I do not go to this Red Robin location, and for good reason. This experience at this Red Robin were nowhere near meeting expectations. I had a 6-top and the other guests on my cheque complained that their hamburgers were cold, the pop was not fresh and it was not worth the money at all. I don't think I'll return to this Red Robin location anytime soon, and to any Red Robin (at least) for the next couple of months.  Plus, it get's better; I didn't even make it out of the parking lot when I started feeling sick. Great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte?start=40
