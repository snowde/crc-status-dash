Billy B.,"Soddy-Daisy, TN",13,117,53,5.0,12/10/2017,"With all the competition for a great burger in the Chattanooga area you really have to stand out to be noticed. as far as chain restaurants go, Red Robin does a very good burger and they have a lot of selection. their portion size are very decent, and the bottomless fries with a variety of sauces gives you some options on how you want to enjoy it.  I got their Burnin` burger that had a lot of jalapenos and even had a grilled one on top. I enjoy it I want if I'm out in that area again wanting a hamburger, I will go to Red Robin. Our server Josie, was all over it. rather it be an extra sauce I wanted or a drink refill my wife needed, she was there and extremely friendly. If she is typical of the servers there, going there was probably a treat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga
Cheryl M.,"Jacksonville, OR",51,13,,2.0,12/29/2017,"A very disappointing Red Robin -- first, the restaurant was filthy. We have eaten and enjoyed meals at Red Robin's in Durham and Charlottesville -- both very clean, comfy ambiance, nice for a low key dinner while traveling. This location is NOT recommended.  The lighting is awful -- super bright, not relaxing at all.  The Caesar salad is actually just a head of romaine lettuce. Nothing else aside from excessive dressing. Do not order this. Fries were over salted.  Our waiter was polite and sporadically attentive. However, he needed reminders on ordered items and seemed overwhelmed.  The restrooms were very dirty and the entire place needed a really good cleaning. Where's the management?!  Do not eat at this location. Go to Red Robin elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga
Donald K.,"Chattanooga, TN",2,32,8,5.0,11/8/2017,"When you eat at chains, you have to compare them to other restaurants and the other ones in the chain. This location is a trend setter. They are the high mark! The food is always the best quality, and they always offer more fries.  The service is wonderful and attentive! They really represent what you would expect here.  Of course the environment is amazing and such a neat area.  I have to really brag that hearing the staff talk and interact with everyone is so different from other restaurants. They remember you, and they also keep conversation, just enough, when they check on you.  This location is so worth a visit!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga
Keith G.,"Chattanooga, TN",3,38,54,1.0,12/31/2017,"Really...two strikes in ONE DAY? Since Rodizio in Hamilton Place had no time for me, went to Red Robin instead. Seated quickly, friendly server. Ordered a deluxe burger that per description had jalapeno relish. Ordered the burger WITHOUT the jalapeno relish since they make me very sick. Server said no problem, and of course the burger arrived swimming in the relish on the top and bottom. Server apologized and manager comped the burger. Guess it's a sign that I better just go to Burger King and go home. Happy New Year.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga
Randy P.,"Cleveland, TN",12,14,21,4.0,12/30/2017,15 bucks for a burger and fries is a little steep. It was a very good burger I'll admit. Very basic beer and cocktail selection. Nice music playing overhead. Not as good as the one I ate it in Maui but pretty much what you would expect from a sit down theme restaurant. Excellent service and staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga
Janelle D.,"Prescott, AZ",3,33,73,1.0,12/31/2017,"Disappointing. Waited 15 minutes for our server to even stop by our table. We had to ask for utensils, napkins and our sauces multiple times. Ordered dessert and it looked absolutely pathetic. Didn't come with the berry sauce. I pressed the call button to notify our waiter and all he said was ""sorry a new girl made it, I'll take it off for up.""

William M.,"Maryville, TN",46,220,39,1.0,5/23/2017,"If there were NO STARS that's what I'd give this place. I've been here many times and have done a previous review. This location has always bordered on mediocrity, but after today I can say without hesitation that this is the worst Red Robin I've ever experienced. The service here is non-existent, I sat a table for 10 minutes while staff walked back and forth with no one taking a drink order. I watched a table of 4 get seated next to me and they faired no better. Once I was able to order then began the 60+ minute wait for $12.00+ cheeseburger accompanied by cold French fries. The table of 4? They waited an additional 10minutes before their food was served. All over the restaurant people were walking out without eating because no one was being served. There were no apologies, no managerial visits and no class at this place. This place is a dump and if I try to come here again please slap me into next week!!!

Audrey B.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,18,,1.0,11/21/2017,I have been to this location a few times and it gets worse every time. I understand it's Red Robin but this location is awful. The hosts always have a negative attitude and are not friendly. It usually takes about 10 minutes just to get a waitress to the table once you're seated. There are also tables that have not been cleaned off the whole time I was there (each time). From what I can tell it is terrible management.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga
Bill P.,"Chattanooga, TN",118,178,2069,1.0,12/15/2016,"We knew we shouldn't do it, but after some shopping at the mall last night, we said what the heck, let's go to Red Robin.   I told our server that we hadn't been there since 2007, when we had another bad experience.  Peyton was our server.  Great server but he didn't have much to work with.   Now let's say you're going to start a place known for hamburgers.  What is going to be your point of emphasis?  Alcoholic beverages?  Milkshakes?  Fries?  The bun and condiments?  No, the main thing is going to be the actual friggin burger itself.  When you serve a burger that is not perfectly round and is irregularly shaped, that is a good thing and says you hand pattied it there right before you cooked it or shortly before.  Unfortunately, the burger patties here ARE perfectly round, like they were stamped out of a machine.  And they taste like it.  And it is a very fine grind -- too fine.   We got the chili cheese fries as an app and split the gourmet cheeseburger.  Krystal's chili cheese fries are 100 times better than these, which were cold and devoid of flavor.  The burger, which they split for us, along with the steak fries (fries were very good), had a relish on the bottom bun that completely ruined the taste.  Our server warned us about it, but we figured how bad could it be?  It's bad.  But even after scraping that off, it was still a bad burger with little flavor.  I don't know how many better burgers there are in town than this place.  You could start with McDonald's and go from there. I really wonder how this place makes it being so bad.  Me thinks is combination of location, festive decor, booze, and the fact that evolution has caused humans to lose their taste buds.  People eat anything these days.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga
Caitanya O.,"Chattanooga, TN",31,23,14,4.0,10/26/2017,"My sister treated me out today. We split a chz burger. Cooked perfectly, the flavor was fantastic. Endless fries. I left stuffed. Love this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga
Robert W.,"McDonald, TN",0,1,2,1.0,6/15/2017,Ate here and the food was extremely over cooked. I had the fish and chips. I thought they had brought me chicken by mistake.

Pete B.,"Washington, DC",50,1,,1.0,8/13/2017,"In summary, this place sucks. From the hostess seating us to our uninterested waitress, there was no attempt to make us feel we were wanted there. We never even got our food, we left after 30 minutes after placing our order and never being visited again. I try to avoid chains for this very reason, and this experience further shows why red robin and the like are losing customers.. no passion, no attention and poor attitude.

Mikee R.,"Murphy, NC",88,973,97,1.0,8/12/2016,WTF! I wanted a bowl of french onion soup and a Royal Red Robin.  What I got was promptly seated by a friendly hostess.  After waiting ten minutes at a booth in the back of the mostly empty  house we realized that there was never going to be anyone coming over. The wife says let's go. I made sure to tell the manager as we were walking out. How many second tries do I need to give Red Robin?  I am currently the Duke of this location and I live two hours away.

Netiah F.,"Chattanooga, TN",0,7,2,1.0,3/22/2017,Black people don't go here. My server was racist my food was wrong and cold waited like 30 mins before I was seated waited another 30 mins before he took my order. My soda was watered down. After complaining about my food the manager said he was gonna fix it so he brought back the same cold ass burger and cold ass fries. And the same watered down drinks. They only have 1 black in the whole establishment and he is a cook. The staff was AWFUL and not friendly that was my FIRST AND LAST TIME eating at a red robin ever in life.

Brett F.,"Chattanooga, TN",178,67,7,3.0,7/27/2016,"Food was good, normal Red Robin standard. Waitress was courteous, although clearly very busy.

Doug B.,"Riceville, TN",5,75,,1.0,11/3/2015,"Not good. Sat at the bar, pretty much ignored. Two staff members alternated, neither seemed particularly interested, disappearing for most of my visit. When I asked to settle up, the lady apologized for the poor service and made some excuses about being short staffed. Sounds like a management issue. I got the vegan burger. For some reason,  a few places seem to believe that because a meatless sandwich won't make you sick if it's not heated, there's no need to worry about it. Well, it may not make you sick, but it's still unpalatable when cold. The ""bottomless"" fries were cold and stale, so I didn't test the bottom. Not recommended.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga?start=20
Yvonne K.,"Ringgold, GA",30,190,53,1.0,11/2/2015,This was probably my last visit at this particular Red Robin. Seated near the bar and a loud foul mouth drunk almost made us leave and we should have! The bartender (our waitress) just laughing at him! Manager lurking about seemed to be friends never once visited tables checking on customers like others in this chain. Food was average but my husband & I both thought the lettuce was bad.  Beware of the new table kiosk the games should be free but charge $1.99.  Burger prices are really high for how the quality has gone down. I can think of a lot of places much better....big disappoint!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga?start=20
Janet L.,"Decatur, GA",28,28,37,4.0,10/12/2015,"For the longest time, I had been wanting to come to Red Robin-- maybe because I had that signature ""Red Robin, yuuum!"" tune stuck in my head (Pretty good marketing there haha) but also I was intrigued by the Blue Moon shake I'd heard about.  This location is attached to Hamilton Place Mall. We came for a late lunch and had a pretty nice time. There was confusion with change of shift and seating so it took a second longer than normal to be seated.  So vegetarians beware... This is clearly not the place for you. Burgers, burgers, burgers... Dominate the menu. When you're a chain restaurant though, it's probably best to specialize hardcore on something. Red Robin does that well. I'm not typically a beef eater, but I loved that Whiskey BBQ burger with the endless sweet potato fries. It wasn't the best burger I've ever had, but for a chain, it was rockin.  As for drinks... Man, I love Blue Moon, and I love shakes... So when you put it together, that Blue Moon shake was an excellent complement to my meal. My boyfriend (also DD for the day) had the nonalcoholic orange cream soda or something to that tune. He said it was pretty good. As far as service goes, it was good. But they make it easy too because you have this touch screen pad at the table that allows you to call for your server (like the bell button you find at Korean BBQ places). We only had to use the call button once. Our waiter was pretty good.  The environment is fun and casual. There's some tvs around and lots of cool decor. The one thing I'd caution though is that they don't really make it clear that playing games or things on the touch pad adds a $1.99 entertainment fee to your bill. It wasn't a big deal when we found out, but it would have been nice to know beforehand.  Other notes- parking is easy because it's at a mall (though I guess it could get dicey as the prime holiday season shopping gets underway). The place is clean, and the bathrooms aren't gross. So all in all, not a bad place to stop and grab some grub before or after you do some shopping. I'll definitely be back... For the Blue Moon shake if nothing else!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga?start=20
Jenn R.,"Murphy, NC",7,60,14,1.0,8/12/2016,Very disappointing.  The hostess sat me and my husband immediately.  We sat there for 10 minutes without ANYONE asking to take our drink order.

Cynthia B.,"Chattanooga, TN",7,1,,1.0,4/9/2016,"Took my son there for a late dinner.  Restaurant was pretty slow at that time but there was trash under almost every table.  Even the one we were seated at.  The wait staff was just hanging out, no one trying to clean up.  Our waitress couldn't be bothered to actually come to our table to take our order, instead she leaned across the railing beside us.  I ordered my usual favorite cobb salad but it was inedible.  The chicken had gristle or something in EVERY bite.  It was horrible.  While we were eating a woman in the kitchen screamed out ""G.. Da...!""  All of the tables heard it and all heads turned toward the kitchen.  So unprofessional and not something I wanted my child to hear in a restaurant.  I don't think I will be going back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga?start=20

After all that wait,  husband got like 3 fries with his meal.  Took 20 minutes for the promise of more to arrive.  Cost us $55 to feed 2 adults and one 3 year old,  and we didn't even like the food,  and had to take it with since you just can't make a 3 year old sit 2 hours in a restaurant.  And his chocolate milk made him sick.  And I cleaned it up myself,  finally got the server's attention and she brought 3 dry paper towels.  I kid you not.

Janet M.,"New York, NY",0,23,,3.0,9/6/2014,"I think that if Red Robin had to rely on everything BUT their superlative burgers, they would cease to be. Fortunately for them, they've perfected the burger making process, so on a recent visit, we were unsurprisingly pleased with our meals.  However, we were also unsurprisingly underwhelmed with everything else.   My ""alcoholic"" beverage, for example, barely made a dent in my liver.  For $7, I expect more than a cup of ice and some pina colada mix, but that's what I got.  Tips from my bar tab can pay for a semester of college, so if your bar tending skills are on point, I will be your BFF. Unfortunately for this outpost, I didn't even want to try another cocktail had I been asked. Which I was not. What really lets down Red Robin seemingly at every location is service issues.  Servers seem trained either poorly or not at all.  Our waitress was very pleasant, but didn't ask if we wanted another round of drinks or any dessert, which was odd since we mentioned it was my birthday. The runner that dropped off our meals literally dropped off our meals and ran without giving us cutlery or napkins. We spent nearly 5 minutes trying to flag down any server for cutlery and eventually another waitress assisted us, but it's aggravating to watch your meal getting cold because you can't find one server in a place this size to help you out. This brings me to my biggest issue with every Red Robin I've been to: servers disappearing for long periods of time. Where do they go?  Is the kitchen half a mile away? Service is always so slow that I fully expect to be watching Cosmos and see Neil Degrasse Tyson explain the black hole that seems to swallow up Red Robin waitstaff. I love a good burger, but if I have to bring a book and a flask to get through a meal here, I might as well stay home and be aggravated for free.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga?start=20

Haley J.,"Chattanooga, TN",0,6,,1.0,10/10/2016,"My husband and I typically love Red Robin. We have been to many other locations, and they have always been great. This was a very different experience. The host sat us at a table in the back, and after about 15 minutes of no one stopping by our table, my husband told the host. After he told the host, it still took about 10 minutes for a waitress to stop by. Once we had a waitress stop by, she told us that we were sitting in a section that was closed (although how was this my fault...that is where the host sat us). Once we ordered, it took at least 20 minutes to get our food, and we had very simple orders. Once we finished eating, it took at least 10 minutes to get our check (we were just sitting there with empty plates), and once she brought the check, it took another 10 minutes for her to pick it back up with the card. I noticed a lot of the other customers had empty drinks or empty plates. There were a lot of tables that needed to be cleaned. However, it wasn't busy at all. There were employees just standing around in a circle talking to each other the entire time we were there. One other annoying thing was that we were sitting right by the kitchen, and we could hear very loud techno type music coming from the kitchen in addition to the music playing in the rest of the restaurant.

Brandon H.,"Atlanta, GA",3,29,,4.0,4/8/2016,"I was contacted this week by Red Robin employees and was given a 20.00 gift card along with an apology. I appreciate them reaching out and that is very good customer service. Their attempt to make up for the poor evening was acceptable and made all the difference in my returning to try them again. Reaching out shows respect for your customers and as a person who eats out a significant amount these days, businesses that show their appreciation for my patronage are placed on my go to list (It doesn't hurt my fiance LOVES RR). Went to RR again to give them another try. Ordered the Blue Ribbon burger and remembered to order it with plenty of pink. Burger came out this time as ordered and the meat was cooked perfectly. That's the good news. Now here's the bad news. The burger was mediocre at best. I've figured out why though. It's the meat. I don't know if they switched vendors, if it's prepared differently or what, but the flavor and quality of the meat simply doesn't seem to be as good as it once was. The burger cooked to medium (which is about as close to medium rare as you're going to get at RR) was still dry and flavorless. It crumbled apart. The toppings of the burger were good (I'm a Bleu Cheese lover). I ordered it with double meat on it this time. My fiance eats her burgers cooked to well, well, well done and she thinks their Guacamole Bacon Burger is heaven on Earth. Both girls enjoyed their meals. My daughter had pizza (which she said was fantastic) My other daughter had meatball bites (she said they were tasty). I'm becoming picky in my old age I suppose. Red Robin did make up the previous issue though and they demonstrated excellent customer service and commitment to excellence. The meat issue is likely something that won't be fixed anytime soon. On that note, next time I go, I'm going to try the new premium burgers which I believe have a higher quality meat. I'll update my review on those. Also, they do make tasty chicken sandwiches especially the California one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga?start=20

The Whiskey River BBQ burger with the vegan BOCA patty substitute.... NO MAYO...   Well it was after 10pm and every employee looked like they were ready to go home and were acting like they were ready to go home, but the waitress at the bar managed to take our order while continuing to talk nonstop to her coworkers.   So while my sister and I waited for our food at the bar we didn't say anything, we just wanted to get our food and go... we were tired.  And while waiting at the bar the lights went out in the restaurant, not a power outage, more like someone flipped the switch off...and it was a bit uncomfortable, but the lights were back on soon enough.   We eventually got our food, checked the contents... my sister with her bacon cheese burger, I with my BOCA patty.... the food was correct!!! or so I thought.  So we got in the car and as we drove away, I prepared my empty stomach for a vegetarian delight, but something caught my eye on that burger... something was glowing in the dark.  So I lifted the top bun and behold MAYO... globs of MAYO on my burger, which I specifically asked for NO MAYO.  So with growling noises close to an angry lion, I tell my mother to turn the car around.... we're going back.   I walk back into RR with box in hand, pissed!!!  I went to the bar and told the waitress my burger had not only MAYO on it but extra MAYO.  So as my temper usually gets the better of me, I tell her I don't have time to wait for another burger... I just wanted my money back....  So off she exits to the kitchen and up pops a manager who is nice and apologizes for the mayo on my burger and said because it was a BOCA patty it wouldnt take long to remake... But he wanted to give me fresh fries... so I text my sis in the car and she's like they'll wait.  So the manager surprisingly gives me a gift card for the mistake and again apologizes.  By then my anger had passed and when he handed me my food, I ran like a mad person out the door to the car.   The order was right this go round... no glowing MAYO...  The only thing saving from giving them 2 stars was that it's a good veggie burger substitute (firm texture and a grilled-like taste) and the manager was nice and that I've had a similar experience at this location before (I received meat instead of veggie patty) but management was helpful then.  Other than that it's usually an okay place to eat at but like all restaurants they have their off moments.  Would I go back if I was in the Chattanooga area...sure.  Will I check my food even closer next time...you betcha!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga?start=40

Stacy B.,"Clermont, FL",20,42,9,2.0,5/3/2014,"Despite coming in at 2:30 pm on a random Wednesday afternoon (4-30-14) to a virtually empty restaurant, the service was dismal. We approach the podium, the young man asked how many in our party, (2) then said ""hold on a minute"", then disappeared for about 5 min. Really? You don't anticipate customers and have a basic knowledge at any time of available tables?  We were finally seated at a booth and were at least acknowledged within a few minutes. Ordering was slow, but waiting for the food to arrive was seriously bad. I actually stood up to look for the waitress after awhile, because really, how long does a burger and fries take?! I noticed a lonely order was sitting back at the ledge at the kitchen, and since we were virtually alone in the restaurant, I knew it was ours just sitting there getting cold. And it was. No apologies for the long wait, no refills on our drinks, no clearing of the salad plates. The food was cold; so I immediately ordered a basket of unlimited fries and they came out hot and fresh. I would've asked for a new hot burger, but it was now 3:15 pm and I was very hungry by this point.  I gave this two stars because the food was good; they really have awesome burgers and fries, but for $10-$15 plus tip meal at a burger joint, you expect better service, especially at an off time.  I will definitely try coming back again due to the quality of the food, but with good management and service, they could be so much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga?start=40

Brandon J.,"Atlanta, GA",33,115,191,4.0,8/11/2011,"This being the my first ever visit to a Red Robin, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect.  I think I had an image of a ""Sonic"" type restaurant in my head.  Let me just say - I was way off.  :)  This is NOT a fast food restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised by the neat decor of the place.  Americana lined the walls, creating a very likable and retro feel.  I was so hungry when I got there - just about everything on the menu looked amazing. I settled on some Sweet Potato Fries as an App - and although they weren't the most stellar I've ever had, the unique taste when coupled with the side of interesting and tasty sauce (half ketchup, half semi-spicy Asian sauce) made this an enjoyable and much welcomed Appetizer. For my Entree I decided on the ""Whiskey River BBQ Burger"".  It's a nice, thick and juicy burger basted with their signature BBQ sauce and served atop crispy onion straws and adorned with lettuce, tomato and mayo.  Mighty delicious, if I may say so myself!   As a side for the burger, I decided to sub out their standard fries for Mac & Cheese.  Here's where the problems began (but don't worry - this story has a  happy ending!).  The Mac & Cheese was served pretty much stone cold.   A few disappointing glances and a several minutes later, I had some piping hot M&C back on my table and ready to enjoy.  It's not Mac & Cheese like you're probably used to.  It was very creamy within and  really only 'topped' with cheddar cheese.  Kinda unusual - and it made for a different experience.  Would I order it again?  Maybe, maybe not. And now for the happy ending (no... not THAT kind of happy ending... get your minds out of the gutter!).  Following the Mac & Cheese debacle, the store Manager was actually the one to bring the replacement Mac & Cheese over to the table, along with his sincere apologies and an explanation of what happened (he stated his people ""know better"" and that they must have fired the M&C at the time they put in the burger - having apparently overlooked the fact that by the time the burger cooks, the M&C will be stone cold.)  He then proceeded to comp the Mac & Cheese $1 upgrade charge.    ""That was nice"" you're probably thinking... But wait!  There's more!  Following the consumption of the food - it didn't seem right leaving the place without one of those delicious-looking milkshakes they seem to be famous for... and alas, I broke down and got one.  Much to my surprise, the very nice manager brought over the milkshake and once more let me know how sorry he was for the cold Mac & Cheese and wanted to comp the milkshake too.   Wow.... now that's what I'm talking about great Customer Service!!  It seems almost like a lost art nowadays - but the manager here ensured I left a happy customer and that will ensure I give them another chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga?start=40

Kylix T.,"Chattanooga, TN",0,5,1,3.0,12/15/2012,"Service was more interested in their fellow coworkers than us. They were also more attentive to their closing duties than to our needs. (We arrived about an hour before they close.) Very slow refills, no napkins, we even received our appetizer AFTER our main course (which the waiter thought was funny) and everything was luke warm to boot. Not hot. It was obviously made and then left to get cold instead of being delivered to our table. I like Red Robin when the food is prepared correctly, but this is the typical type of service you receive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga?start=40

Becky S.,"Compton, CA",2,9,1,5.0,1/6/2013,"Our first visit to the restaurant was a little disappointing as our waitress was more interested in gossipping and checking her nails.

We asked for a manager and described everything to him. He was very nice and apologetic and fixed the problems.  The food was not great but it was still good and we still wanted to pay for it even after his offer to comp everything. He promised it would be better next time we came back and it truly has. We've been back several times since and couldn't be happier with the dependably good service and the food, it turns out, is really good when it's hot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga?start=40

Kyle B.,"Gadsden, AL",70,179,97,4.0,11/23/2008,"I was at Hamilton Place Mall with some out-of-town family members and we were all hungry for a quick bite to eat.  We settled on the new Red Robin that was here.  When we walked in, I was really surprised at how busy it was, even before noon!  We were greeted quickly and warmly and soon we were seated.   This is a family restaurant, so if screaming kids aren't your thing, I'd advise looking elsewhere for food.  As the name of the business indicates, they have a huge selection of various burgers.  If you're looking for something other than a burger, they have entrees and salads too.  We all ordered burgers and were offered our first round of their ""bottomless french fries"".  I got the garlic, the rest of the family got regular. The garlic fries were okay, they were very hot, but the garlic doesn't really stick to the fries.  It actually tasted better with the fry seasoning they put on the table for you.  The rest of the family enjoyed their regular fries. It took a long time, but finally the burgers arrived.  They were nice and hot (so I guess the kitchen was backed up).  I got the Bleu Ribbon Burger and it was delicious!   On my first bite, I noted too much tomato, so I took off one of the two ginormous slices of tomato off the burger and *then* it was perfect.   Our server was always ready with the drink refills and checked back on us just enough to make sure we were okay and needed anything else.  The food was very good.  I really enjoyed it and will definitely come back anytime I'm in the mood for a quick bite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga?start=40
