Michelle L.,"Saint Louis, MO",68,1007,1635,4.0,9/2/2017,"I actually really like Red Robin despite the facts that is it 1. a chain restaurant and 2. geared towards kids and families. Newsflash, the bar is always 21+ at a Red Robin. I was out and about on a busy Saturday and craving a burger. I ordered the Red's Tavern Double® Burger (Two classic-sized patties of fire-grilled goodness with Red's Secret Tavern Sauce™, American cheese, tomato and lettuce.) I asked for the french fries to be extra crispy because I hate limp and soggy fries. When my burger came out the french fries were crispy and perfect! The burger was good too. I will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesterfield
O W.,"Saint Louis, MO",54,214,118,2.0,10/1/2017,The food is generally decent and I love the unlimited fries. But this place seems to have terrible service. They don't listen to what the server orders. They run out of things. And then the manager never comes over and say they're sorry    Then the waitress tells us that she took the bad food off for bill and when I hit the little device it's still on there.

Alexander T.,"Weldon Spring, MO",0,1,,5.0,1/7/2018,"Great food. Burgers were in the $10 range although I like the unlimited fries. Friendly staff and great atmosphere. It's surprisingly good food for a chain. I ordered the Red Robin Gourmet Burger. It was tasty and had everything you'd expect on a burger (pickles, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, etc).

Erica R.,"Creve Coeur, Saint Louis, MO",50,72,31,3.0,7/8/2017,"Great food. Burgers in the $10 range. More importantly, they covered ALL the bases: two kinds of veggie patty for the vegan teen; a customizable concoction for the teen who'll eat anything; 20 weird options for the ""who knows what she'll do next"" rebel. A classic for their mom, and fish for me. The garlic herb fries are worth the upgrade, no doubt. And for our birthday boy, the LOUDEST birthday song ever, with a sundae! My only disappointment was that I was apparently invisible to our server. I got refills on request, but only by request-- everyone else couldn't finish fries or drinks without them magically reappearing. They couldn't have born more attentive behavior. But I was politely ignored and I never figured out why.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesterfield
Joan G.,"Saint Louis, MO",182,334,1461,3.0,8/19/2016,"3.5 stars. I really don't like writing reviews for chain restaurants because after all, they are a chain restaurant.  I wasn't excited about meeting friends here because there were other restaurants around.  But in the end, I was pleasantly surprised with my meal.  The only thing I didn't like was that I felt that I needed a booster seat to sit at the table because the chairs were so low. The menu is pages of different burgers (and I know they have fish also). I scanned the menu until I found I word I don't pass up - chili. In fact, it was called the chili chili burger.  I ordered fries with mine.  And if you love carbs, they have bottomless fries.  And if you don't like ketchup, you can order an aioli (a fancy name for flavored mayonnaise).  My burger was good and cooked the way I liked it.  The chili was also good.

Jim W.,"Chesterfield, Saint Louis, MO",30,16,24,3.0,7/2/2016,"Menu is getting waaaay toooo complex. Too many levels of burgers and options. Starting to feel like a sit down Sonic as far as menu is concerned. As for this automated menu...well I'm ok with automation and cutting cost but when the only time I see the server is when I place my initial order and when they scurry by to drop off my second drink (which I had to type in myself on table top gizmo), don't expect the same level of tipping as when I have people being much more attentive to my at other places down the street. This time I paid the auto-suggested 20% tip on the screen. But beware, the less I see your servers and the more I see of you table top computer, I will start taking advantage of your cost cutting technology as well. My tips will be reduced from 20% to 10% The more you save, RR, the more I will save too until my tips are down to 0%",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesterfield

Cyndi S.,"Chesterfield, Saint Louis, MO",103,28,83,4.0,1/8/2017,Red Robin is one of my favorite chain restaurants. You can always find good burgers and bottomless fries. Today we went as a family and my husband and I tried Different burgers than we usually get. I tried the black pepper burger with bacon on ciabatta bread and he tried his sweet Carolina as a wedgie burger (wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun). My daughter ordered her favorite simple Veggie burger with bottomless fries and ghost pepper sauce. We all loved what we ate. We loved the fact that we could order anything the way we want it.

Maqui M.,"Columbia, MO",2,62,41,2.0,8/28/2015,"Food was good, but what they mean by bottomless fries means one small paper carton of 12 French fries are set in the middle of your table, and if you and your party of 7 want more than 3 fries per person, you have to wait for the attendant to come by and offer you another 1 oz serving.   All you can eat, until they wear you down.  The unlimited fries is a hoax that relies on knowing that customers don't like to ask for more and just go away, similar to AT&T unlimited data plan 3 mb at a time, or the bistro that has all you can eat meats, but fill you up on chicken before the filet comes out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesterfield

I want to start by saying our waiter, Brian, was absolutely fantastic... cannot give him enough credit for what we went through... the fried cheese sticks and pickles were fine... nothing spectacular... the kids meals (chicken fingers for one and mac n cheese for the other) were cooked... nothing crazy there... 3 of us started with a salad- and the salad mix was brown and awful... not sure how it left the kitchen... the burgers were over cooked... a mac n cheese burger (not the name of it on the menu), a blue cheese burger (not the real name...) and the burnin' love burger were over cooked to the point they actually tasted burnt... spicy sauce that was requested on the side of the  mac n Cheese burger was also put on the bottom bun for some reason... this is also after we got a new burger because instead of cheddar, they had pepper jack on it... The French fries were nasty... they tasted like old frozen French fries that were pulled from the bottom of the freezer... my mother in law didn't even get to eat because she had ordered the salad... I didn't get more than one bite of my burger because there wasn't even enough of the ranch to douse over it to hide the taste... my husband was able to eat the mac n cheese burger because spicy things have zero effect on him... my brother in law had a fraction of his burger because of the burnt-ness too... here's to a $50 meal (just my portion of the bill btw! Not including everyone's in that total!) that consisted of 2 French fries and an iced tea... Oh yah- the ""manager"" that was here today was very apathetic when he visited our table... didn't really care if we were satisfied or not... not sure if I'll be back to this location or not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesterfield?start=20
Ben S.,"Chesterfield, MO",255,1114,616,4.0,10/12/2013,"Funny story... Last year as we were contemplating a move to STL we decided to bring the kids to town to play in the city.  One of them was familiar with a trampoline place so we went there.  After working up a powerful appetite we decided to go to Red Robin because our previous locale didn't have one of their restaurants.  Loved everything!  After dinner we needed to fill the tank but I was incensed by the price of gas at the first station where we stopped so I kept driving.  There was a gas station just up the road but I couldn't get to it because of construction so I kept going.  It seemed like I was driving into the middle of nowhere but spotted another station and reluctantly paid a penny per gallon more at this second station. Why is this funny?  Mainly because a couple of weeks after moving into our new house it all clicked...we moved into the area of town where all of this transpired. How is this applicable to the restaurant which I am reviewing?  It really isn't but this is a franchise place so there's not really a lot to say.  Personally, I like that I am reminded of this story every time we eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesterfield?start=20

Mark E.,"Chesterfield, MO",193,34,6,2.0,1/14/2014,"I love Red Robin and their burgers. I also love their steak fries, or at least I used to. In the past, the fries were on the side of the plate the burger was served on. On my last visit there the fries were neatly arranged standing straight up in a metal cup. It certainly looked pretty and changed the plating quite a bit. But there was a problem. It would seem that in order to you get those fries to stand up so pretty in the metal cops that somebody had to load the metal cups in advance. Then the cups must have been put under heat lamps.  so when it was time to eat the fries, instead of the crisp on the outside and gooey on the inside steak fries that I'm used to, I got dried out, sometimes withered, hunks of potato.  I still love Red Robin, I think their idea of presenting the fries differently is a good one, but it definitely makes them taste much worse then they used to.

Joey W.,"Arnold, MO",949,286,74,3.0,10/24/2013,"I usually like my visits at Red Robin, but I did not have such a good visit at this location. Let me explain. I came to this location with my room-mate after he was done with his shift. We decided on Red Robin. Bad move and the reason being was due to the fact that we had a very lousy server. I understand that this place was busy, but the wait and the fact that she gave us really impersonable and grouchy service was inexusable. Secondly, I didn't like her responses at all.  I ordered a BBQ burger with the fruit salad as a side. I normally like to order my sandwiches as a boca version and every server didn't have an issue, but this lady somehow took offense.  ""Are you a vegetarian?"" the lady asks with a grouchy look.  ""Umm, no"" was my response. I acutally shouldn't have come out with a response at all because that wasn't her business. However, I tend to try to act like a mild manner Clark Kent, so I brushed it aside.  We received our food, but I was never presented with untensils. I looked around for my waitress and she was not to be found.  She came back asking what was wrong and I said that I was missing my utensils. Again, came the grouchy look and I was then presented with a knife and fork. I tried to remediate the situation by saying, ""I appreciate your help."" She then gave me a scrunched up look and then said, ""you're wierd."" Like that. I almost fell out of my chair in exasperation.

I've been back numerous times and will continue to do so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesterfield?start=40
Kelly S.,"Lawrence, KS",8,59,2,1.0,10/11/2011,Absolutely the worst Red Robin I have been to. There was actually an ant walking on our table. There were a few others walking on the wall next to us too. All three of our orders were messed up and the fries were cold. Not one good thing to say.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesterfield?start=40
Mike A.,"Wildwood, Saint Louis, MO",2,52,3,3.0,6/27/2014,"I have been four times now to Red Robin. This location was the most recent visit, but the other three were all at different locations. That being said they have all been the same experience. What stands out.......  lunch, $100 bucks with NO BOOZE. It is an OK burger, OK fries that honestly, we never eat what little they give the first serving. ""Bottomless"" fries don't mean much to us...except when I went to pick up the metal bucket the fries come in, they all fell through the bottom, it was actually just a metal ring!...now I know what they really mean about ""bottomless fries""! Service was nice, place was clean and convenient location.......SMASH BURGER cost us $54 and Cheeburger cost us $61 with tip. Both also in the same area so Red Robin will probably be another two years before we might visit again. One good thing about Red Robin.......good for larger groups!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesterfield?start=40
Stephanie S.,"Saint Louis, MO",107,705,28,4.0,8/16/2009,"I usually don't review chains, but I break my own rules from time to time. Don't judge me.  This was my first time at Red Robin, and I was pretty impressed. Our waiter was AMAZING. Very friendly, and very helpful.  I ordered the fried chicken salad, which was tasty. My boyfriend ordered the chicken sandwich with fries.  Everything was pretty good. Not great, just good. Food quality is along the lines of Applebee's.  The service is what gave Red Robin 4 stars from me. Good job. I'd come back if I was in the area again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesterfield?start=40
Mark H.,"Dardenne Prairie, MO",8,377,3,4.0,7/16/2012,Great burgers. Best to sit in the bar if you don't have kids.  The Royal Red Robin +onion is my favorite.  You just can't beat a burger with a hard fried egg on it.  Don't scoff unless you have actually tried one...lol,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesterfield?start=40
Todd S.,"St Peters, MO",214,28,6,5.0,3/6/2012,The food was great an cooked to order. The fries were bottomless an piping hot.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesterfield?start=40
Emily W.,"Florissant, MO",25,9,22,1.0,10/7/2012,"Our experience started off on the right track, but we ended up getting derailed. Everything was business as usual at first.  My husband and I ordered waters and decided on the new pretzel bites as an appetizer (which were really good, actually). The derailment happened after taking a few big gulps of our waters. We realized our glasses had foreign ""floaties"" that weren't caused by us (the insides of the glasses had obvious additions that weren't the requested h2o).  I tried to get the attention of our waitress, but she seemed held captive at another table taking an order (for quite an extended period of time. Not sure if she knew them or they just had a lot of questions about the menu).  So, we received our food from a server and I told him about the waters. He took them and brought us out some new ones. Ok, fine.  While eating our meals my husband receives another water refill from our waitress.  In a new - dirty - glass. Gross. I got her attention and tell her about this current glass and the others. She apologizes sincerely and brings back a new one.  After this, we decide to just get the check and leave, but we forgot we ordered another round of fries for my husband (unlimited steak fries are a good draw-in for potato lovers).  A few minutes after we got them our waitress brings around a basket of sweet potato fries, on the house. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of sweet potato fries, so, it's not quite redeeming to me of the water situation. I'm talking about a total of four dirty glasses. I just felt like if you were going to offer something ""on the house"" could we have an option?  We ate, like, four of them. Anyway, we're going to skip this chain when contemplating options in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesterfield?start=40
Craig B.,"Ballwin, MO",63,124,103,4.0,6/19/2007,"This place is definitely a guilty pleasure of mine.  Aside from the fact that this is a family (read kids) eating establishment, its worth visiting for the burgers. For those of you who are opposed to visiting chain restaurants, and I don't blame you, you probably should stop reading.  Red Robin is a chain restaurant.  A box planted in a strip mall where families can come calm their children with burgers, a few arcade games, and fun.  The place is not on the list of healthy eating establishments, but everyone is guaranteed to find something they like. My favorite?  The Royal Red Robin Burger.  It has american cheese, mayo, bacon, lettuce and a fried egg.  Man do I love this cholesterol laden burger.  I did say this place was a guilty pleasure. Besides burgers, Red Robin has salads, fish (fried), chicken, pork and now pot roast.  Everything is almost labeled as a burger no matter the meat. Appetizers your thing?  The tower of onion rings is good to share between four people.  The mexican ranch dip that comes with it is pretty tasty. There is a bar, but most mixed drinks are fairly weak and over priced. Best of all, this place does not allow smoking inside or on their outside patio!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesterfield?start=40
Chris M.,"Kirkwood, MO",15,4,,4.0,3/29/2006,Great place to take the kids. We go here all the time. Food is actually really good and not just kids food. Good drinks and dessert. Wait is never to long and moves along quick. It is loud and noise. Only complaint is that the food comes out to quick. Make sure to order your appetizers and wait for them to come out before you order to entree. Otherwise you will will be getting both of them at the same time (or close).,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesterfield?start=40
