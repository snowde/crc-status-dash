Tiffany M.,"Flushing, NY",118,264,2393,3.0,11/28/2017,"Came with my friends after a big competition because s were just craving Red Robin! We ordered a bunch of apps and entrees. The apps came out quickly and we had no complaints about the taste or temperature. Our entrees were mostly decent but the soups could use some work.  The reason for the 3 stars is because the service was a tad slow. One of our friends waited over 15 minutes for his drink refill. By the time his margarita arrived to our table you could tell it's been sitting out and the waitress probably forgot to bring it over. On top of that we had to flag down the waitress to get our refill on the bottomless fries. After ordering, we waited at least another 15 minutes for those to come out.  What made it all worth coming here? THE MILKSHAKES! Highly recommend grabbing one before you head out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clifton
Heather L.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",166,112,396,3.0,9/19/2017,"Today was disappointing and would sincerely be 1 or 2 stars, but I normally don't have an issue here. Our waitress went above and beyond so thanks to her I added the extra star.  Today was Tavern Burger Tuesday in which you get a free tavern burger of your choice ($6.99 value) with the purchase of another burger and two beverages. There were three of us and we ordered buffalo wings to start, two tavern burgers - one was the mac n cheese style, and a Royal burger. Also ordered a soda and 2 beers.  Wings came out, yummy as usual, but then there was this long wait for our burgers to arrive. Place wasn't jam packed, but it looked like our waitress was covering both the front and back of the house. Those who come here know it's not a tiny place so imagine this woman having to go back and forth all over. Our burgers finally came out and here's where it all went downhill. My mac n cheese tavern burger was cold, not warm, COLD, but the substituted fruit salad was fine. The mac n cheese felt like it was scooped out of a fridge container and placed on top. My mother's burger was cold and her fries were room temp. My father's Royal and fries were fine. I literally asked the waitress to please take her finger and feel this. She did and apologized profusely saying this is honestly cold and unacceptable. She removed both trays and we waited for our replacements. Twenty five minutes go by and now we are getting annoyed. My father already finished his meal and we were still waiting. The waitress noticed and came over again apologizing saying she will have the meals checked on and will talk to her manager. The burgers come back out and now mine is served with fries, not the fruit salad I substituted for more money and my mother's burger was identical in temp if not colder than before. Her fries were cold and mine were hot. The cheese actually rubberized on hers.  Before the waitress could even walk away my mother said she's done. Over it. The waitress apologized again and brought her out hot fries and we simply asked for the check. Waitress said she will have this rectified and came back to tell us our entire order was covered and nothing was due. We got up and heavily tipped the waitress as we weren't looking for a free ride here, we just wanted our food we ordered at a reasonable temperature and timely.  We never met the manager to thank her or voice our concerns, but our waitress was exceptional. I don't know if this was an off day or what have you, but we will wait a while to return to try again. (Table next to us had problem with their burgers too)  Overall we typically enjoy it here and service is always great. Sadly tonight was no bueno.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clifton
Grace C.,"Washington, DC",197,36,28,2.0,9/11/2017,"not worth it. Came in just before closing on a weekday and the restaurant itself wasn't busy. The service was slow and we kept having to remind the waiter to bring our drinks.  The burgers were just okay. Not worth the price paid.  The fries were soggy and tasted like they've been sitting out for a while.  The onion rings were better, but not by much.  With so many different burger joints now, it's not worth it to come here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clifton

Perhaps it was how they prepared it at this location, because I remember tasting one before off of my friends plate at another location and it seemed good.

Robert T.,"Wood-Ridge, NJ",113,101,,1.0,10/14/2017,I think this was the worst lunch I ever had in my life. My 2 year old son who is not picky at all literally spit out the first bite of his Cheeseburger and the fries were cold and he spit that out as well. My cheeseburger as well was burned and of low quality I took one bite and left it. The toppings were mushy and basically inedible. I ordered the fruit salad on the side which was not fresh and swimming in some of preservative based syrup. Hard to fathom. It also took forever and the place wasn't clean including the Ketchup bottle unfilled. I wouldn't eat here again if I was paid to do so.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clifton
Pasquale R.,"Madison, NJ",1731,1527,245,2.0,5/12/2017,"Subpar service and food. Sat at the bar. It was dirty and sticky. Bartender was a bit annoyed in the beginning but once he read a receipt of an individual who didn't leave a tip and left a crappy note, he became overly friendly. Seriously the receipt was on the bar for everyone to see. It was on there for a good 15 minutes when I was there. Anyhoot it wasn't very busy but the place just gave me a bad vibe. I ordered a tall IPA and their boneless wings (Whiskey River® BBQ)...for $9 you get a nice sized amount (good enough for 2 people) but they don't really cover the wings so there were some that were just naked...seriously? It also comes on a few nacho chips...they were too salty. I didn't get anything else (although known for their burgers) since it wasn't a pleasant experience. 1 and done...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clifton

NOT this is NOT what a Gourmet burger should be like. A FROZEN sliver of a burger piled high with shredded iceburg lettuce. The menu boasted this big beautiful burger with a nice juicy appetizing punch line that got my hubbys mouth to a Mouth-Orgasm just waiting for his order. Nope not even close his sister who can't cook for the life of her would've made a better burger. The burger was nowhere near gourmet quality and seriously lacking any kind of taste, when you have to douse it with a 1/2 a bottle of ketchup to bring it alive there is something wrong!  My PRIME RIB DIP, Red Robin are you kidding me, this was dried up LONDON BROIL, where do you get of trying to pass off this sandwich as prime rib, did you know I am the QUEEN of STEAK, I know my steak! Horrible tough chewy GREY london broil meat with au jus being Onion Soup Mix BROTH!

While not overly packed, service was slow but amicable. When it comes to the food, stick with the basics (boneless wings came slathered in a tangy hot sauce with blue cheese crumbles atop crispy house made chips) and stick with the burgers (should've heeded my own advice: a Whiskey River grilled chicken wrap had a nice tang from the sauce but arrived overwhelmed with shredded lettuce).

Charlie P.,"Garfield, NJ",0,2,3,1.0,10/11/2017,"This is the second time at the Red Robin Clifton and in both cases service was TERRIBLE.  Does not deserve a rating. 10-9-2017. On my last visit, bathroom no TP in either stall, could you imagine. Told staff they looked at me like I had three heads. Was seated at the table and forgotten. Had to go look for the server. Server took order and got lost, went and looked for her again, she then came with three baskets of fries and drinks. Each basket had maybe 6 to 7 fries, not endless. I had to ask again now for forks and napkins. (On a side note the table next to us no server went to there table so they got up and left, the manager tried to stop them, they told him good bye.) Serve never came back until the order came out and of course my burger was wrong. I ordered a double taco tavern burger. So I went looking for the manager. He began arguing with me and telling me I order the large Taco Tavern burger and I was confused.  Mean while the burger I received was a regular cheese burger with lettuce and tomato.  You  would think he would have just apologized and got me what I original order but he had to tell me I was wrong. Later he brought the burger after that No One ever came back to the table to check on us.  We had to go look for the server and ask for the check.  After looking at the check, they took my burger off but so what. You think they would have told me that and apologized and tried to make me a happy customer? Obviously they do not care at all.  Since this is the second time I has bad service at the Clifton Red Robin I will never return. I like Red Robin, I have been to the Paramus, NJ store many times and always a great experience. SO I suggest if your local area go there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clifton

It was pretty empty considering the holiday and good weather, so we got very quick service. Food was top-notch as it always is too. Have been here during peak hours and the service and quality does not diminish given the amount of guests they have.  With the new branding the chain has, this particular location has undergone some renovations with new seating and the addition of the electronic mini-kiosks with games, app and drink ordering, and credit card checkout.

Frederick S.,"Passaic, NJ",2,20,,1.0,11/22/2016,"It's a chain, but really!?!? How bad is this place!!! When I first started coming to this red robin it was good, but lately the food has gotten horrible over time. I think they switch cooks too often or something.  I ordered the Banzai burger, medium well. I was eating the burger, it was cooked perfectly, but at the last bites I noticed it was raw and cold! Also, I ordered it with and egg on top, and the egg white was still runny. My wife ordered a classic burger, just cheddar, lettuce and mayo. The thing was raw! Like literally fresh out the freezer and straight to the grill. This is about the third time this has happened to us.  Zin Burger is up the road, they make better burgers than this place!

They added the bottomless fries to the menu and when I feel like having a cheat day, this is where I go.  The other good part about this place is that the service is pretty quick unlike some other chain restaurants I've been too.

Dexter V.,"Bloomfield, NJ",696,443,3158,1.0,12/26/2014,"I love gourmet burgers.  Before there was Zinburger nearby Red Robin was a good place to grab some good tasting patty bites.  My first visit was fantastic.  I loved their fries, onion rings, and of course burgers done right.  I was impressed and made more visits after that.  Then years passed and I haven't stepped foot into the place since.  Then an opportunity came one night.  While Zinburger would have been a good choice my buddy said we should go to Red Robin.  I didn't hear any objections so we decided to go for it.  Alas I wish we hadn't. This place has lost it's charm since my last visit.  I don't know if it was that particular night but the experience was just not good.  Walking to the restaurant it was a good size crowd but it was nowhere near busy.  That is why I don't understand why the table we were given was dirty.  I mean they took away the dishes and attempted to wipe it but the table was still dirty.  It looked like dirt had been baked into the very fiber of the table.  The seats were rickety and the couch was ripped and looked like it hadn't been taken care of for years.  Now I understand the chain restaurants can never be compared with traditional ones but still the management should try to keep the appeal of the place and at least make an effort to keep it looking new. The food was another disappointment.  We ordered the bar wings and pork riblets.  Both were cold and the chips underneath were soggy.  Probably because they had been sitting out in the open for so long.  Not a good start!  Then my Whiskey River burger came out and once again I was disappointed.  I asked for medium and they gave me medium well and the ""crispy"" onion  inside was the opposite of crispy.  I didn't even finish the burger which is something I never do.  Oh well there's always a first. It's too bad this place is not as good as it used to be.  Guess time changes all.  For this Robin time was not on it's side.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clifton?start=20

This Red Robin used to be the gold standard of Red Robins, and other chain restaurants as well but now, it takes some arm-twisting for me to drive far to come to this RR location.  The space of this RR is pretty nice though. Good layout and atmosphere.  The food is usually on point although the burgers quality has slipped recently, but they handle special requests pretty well.  The service here is definitely lacking. Past few times I've been here, I feel like I've had to struggle to get the servers' attention and it seems to take way to long to receive simple requests like refill on water or honey-mustard condiment.

Nettech N.,"Bloomfield, NJ",0,3,,1.0,7/2/2017,"This was my first time using curbside pickup from any restaurant.  I had not been to Red Robin in a long time but was craving a Royal Red Robin on Saturday July 1.  Their website advertised 12 minute pickup, so I ordered and headed over.  I live less than ten minutes away.  My online order was placed at 8:04 PM with a pickup time of 8:16 PM.  I arrived a couple of minutes early and parked in the curbside pickup spot - there's 3 of them, and there was one other car waiting.  The parking lot was maybe half full.  The other car had their order delivered within a couple of minutes, so I waited patiently.  Another car soon pulled in to the curbside pickup spot and waited with me.  After about 5 minutes he went inside and a minute or so later came back out and sat in his car.  Now it's getting to about 8:25 and we're both waiting.  I pass some more time in the car and finally can't take the waiting anymore and go inside at about 8:35. There's a hostess at the hostess stand and a separate pickup stand.  I wait by the pickup stand for close to 5 minutes.  The hostess doesn't acknowledge me nor gets anyone to help me.  There are several receipts laying on the counter, and I find mine with a time stamp of 8:05.  Finally someone comes to the stand and I point out my receipt, and they respond that they'll check on my order and disappear into the kitchen.  Shortly after someone not in uniform came by and asked if i was helped (manager?).  I said yes and they moved on and never talked to me again.  The other pickup customer comes back in and I ask him if he'd ever ordered curbside before and he said no, but he was as frustrated as I was.  In a couple of minutes the server came back and said my order would be right out.  The other pickup customer waited with me. Finally at 8:45 my order came out.  I asked if there was a problem with my order and the response was no but they were 'busy'.  The restaurant wasn't much more than half full - with plenty of empty tables - so i asked ""if I placed an order with a waitress at 8:05 would my order have come out by now?"" and the answer was ""yeah - probably"".  I then said that the website stated 12 minute service (didn't really expect that) and he said there was a third party website that processed the orders.  Yet the the ticket on the counter was printed at 8:05!  He finished with ""look I just work here"" to which I responded ""well then pass it on"".

I went with something totally out of the ordinary for me - the Red Robin Royal topped with a sunny side fried egg. It went beyond my expectations of what it would taste like. The egg was cooked just right and when you cut the sandwich in half the soft yolk of the egg dripped down the sides of the burger just right. The uncommon combo of the quality burger and breakfast staple was like having breakfast and dinner at the same time -soo good. Will definitely have another.   The server was very good as well. She was bringing refills quicker than you put down an empty glass. A dinner companion of course ordered the onion ring tower, the large one. They were good, but way too much for our party of 3.

Bathroom had more toilet paper on the floor than on the roll, no paper towels. After our check was paid for by credit card using their kiosk on our table it was telling us there was another balance for $2.99 (not sure why) but waiter said we owed for a drink.

Steve A.,"Newark, NJ",298,815,172,3.0,4/6/2014,"The good: Bottomless fries. Steak fries, my favorite kind. Bottomless dipping sauces. The... looked like honey mustard, but it had poppy seeds... and the Thai chili are my favorite. My choice of bun (the cornmeal jalapeno was really nice). Bottomless drinks that no one else can match, including root beer floats! Not so good: The floats were made with soft serve - vanilla only - not real ice cream. I still downed four of them, but I know I'll be unhappy about it later. We had a group of seven, and we needed multiple refills at a time, so they ended up being a bit slow to get there. I can understand why. It's a negative of my experience, but I can't really deduct for it because I can only imagine how much more crowded we made the bar. Decent: The burger. They do pink or not-pink, so my request for ""as rare as they'll allow it"" still came out pink. So it goes. Nothing terrific about the flavor - like your standard Five Guys type pattie. Unfortunately, nothing terrific about the other toppings, either. The onion straws were flavorless. I asked for ghost sauce on my burger, and for the extra 75 cents, I barely tasted anything resembling spicy. In fact, there wasn't even much BBQ sauce on it either, and that was standard. Verdict: On the better half of the burger chains, but not worth the elevated prices for what they claim to be ""gourmet."" You want gourmet, go to Smashburger, Elevation Burger, Zinburger, or many other places in North Jersey. If you want to shove massive amounts of food into your craw, for the same price you can get a triple or quad patty at Five Guys, all the free toppings, and a massive side of fries, along with unlimited trips to the soda machine.

Fred D.,"Pequannock, NJ",4,23,,2.0,1/4/2016,"I am being generous on this one. Our server Amy was the only high point to this meal. I went to this location a couple of years back, but though maybe I hit it on a bad day so I went back.OMG what a bad choice it was.. We had a tower of onion rings which were not bad, but $9.00 for 13 rings. Two out of the 3 of us had burgers and my daughter has a chicken dish. She said the chicken was ok, but it was nothing special. She also ordered the speckled lemonade which was a bottomless drink ,but with the way it was carelessly prepared getting past one is hard enough. For a place that is supposed to be a specialty burger shop it leaves much to be desired. the burgers themselves look to be frozen blanks. They are flavorless where you would be better off buying frozen patties at a wholesale club. There are many different ways you can top it off but it is like putting lipstick on a pig...it is still a pig. Here's is an example...My wife had a Royal Red Robin burger and I had what is called a Pub Burger. The version I had was called Fiery Ghost. The way they are listed on the menu is that they are 2 completely different style of burgers and the process is much different . In reality they look to be the exact same burger with just different toppings.. The care in which the for was prepared was disappointing. There was no care put into the process or preparation .If our food had slightly resembled the picture it would not be so bad, but these burgers were not even close .I know you are saying I could have sent the food back ,but I against doing so, because you never know what is going to come back to you. 2 soda's ,1 Speckled Lemonade,1 onion ring tower,2 burgers & an order of Ensenada Chicken..$69.00 (tip included) .That comes to $23 per person without any alcohol for a burger place.The tip was the best part of the money spent. There are much better places to go close by You can get a 5 guys burger done the way you want it fresh juicy & full of flavor for 1/2 the cost.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clifton?start=60

I was out there with one of my good friends to get a bite to eat and I was excited coming back to this place.  It wasn't that Red Robin was hard to find, but its sign is overshadowed by the large La Quinta Inn sign, so if you see that La Quinta on Rt 3 East in Clifton, then that's where you need to be for Red Robin. The restaurant was sort of packed at first but it really winded down after USA won their World Cup match. We didn't get appetizers, but I did order a couple of Yuenglings after we learned that they were out of Stella Artois. No big deal personally because I am not a huge beer drinker. I asked which burger was good and the server (who had a striking resemblance to the Tampa Bay Rays' Pitcher David Price) ended up suggesting the Black & Blue Burger, which was one of 3 new burgers at Red Robin. It tasted great! It was a burger with sauteed onions, mushrooms, and blue cheese crumbles on ciabatta bread. The fries were very good too; there was this dipping sauce, which I believe was for the burger as a tangy, cheesy mayonnaise but I used it for the fries. All in all, the service was good and quick, it wasn't too loud and we were able to catch up and watch the rest of the USA game! I will be definitely going back as there are two burgers that I haven't had in forever that I need in my life...the Royal Red and the Big Kahuna.

Previous Visits: Have dined in a few times with decent service and the food was prepared well and tasted good.  Previously ordered pick-up once before (Cobb Salad) and it was good as well. Last Week's Visit: I placed an order for take-out over the phone.  I arrived to pick up my order and they said it would be a few minutes, fine.  I waited and then was handed my food.  I peered into the bag and saw utensils, two containers of salad dressing, and a large box that had a considerable weight to it (presumably my burger and salad).  I drove home and settled in at my kitchen table to enjoy my dinner, but I was in for a rude surprise when I opened the box.  Inside the box was just my Bleu Ribbon Burger with an empty compartment next to it where my salad should have been.  I called the restaurant up to notify them of my missing salad.  The employee said, ""I realized right after you left that I forgot to give you your salad.""  So, I left my burger, and drove back to Red Robin to pick up my salad.  The employee actually gave me two house salads because he felt bad.  Well, by the time I got home, my burger was no longer hot, but just warm.  It still tasted good though.  Great flavor!  The salad was alright, probably not worth the gas money of driving back to pick it up though. Morale of the story: Check to make sure everything is in your bag before you leave the restaurant to avoid an extra trip.  The employee was very apologetic and sincere which is why I decided to ultimately give 3 stars instead of 2.

My friend said the banzai burger has a unique taste that no other restaurant can recreate and is worth coming back for. I got the whiskey BBQ burger which was tasty if you're into BBQ. The fries are great and are bottomless so the goodness never has to end. Campfire sauce is boss... it's amazing they should sell it in bottles like ketchup , I would buy it. The red robin seasoning blend add good flavor to the fries and is recommended. The drinks were ok. My friend said the dr. pepper tasted watered down. The freckled lemonade was perfect according to another friend. The onion ring tower was delicious.  Conclusion: Overall good experience because the food is like crack. The wait to be seated sucked especially when you see empty tables.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clifton?start=40

He responds ""finish those first"". WOW I'm not a child to get more food than I can't handle to not eat..

Kristina H.,"North Bergen, NJ",315,131,64,3.0,10/31/2015,"I have never been to a red robin before! My first time was due to my dear husband who has a love for greasy, junk food....preferably from a nationwide chain. We could not be on more opposite sides of the dining out preference spectrum. Anyway, after trying to convince him to go eat some Turkish food I finally gave in to my rumbling tummy because I was hangry!  I wasn't sure what to expect but my expectations were low. The service was excellent. We ordered Thai chicken wings to start and they were seriously DELISH! I was hoping to find something healthy for my entree but it wasn't easy. I just said screw it and ordered the bourbon bbq grilled chicken sandwich. It was also good. I loved the crispy onions. Towards the end of the meal I decided to check for calories online and read that the sandwich I just consumed was.....wait for it......982 calories. I literally wanted to stab my husband, who then asked if I still wanted my last bite considering my findings. To which I said....uh yea I made it this far, might as well! So is Red Robins good.....I guess, if you want some junk to splurge ALOT of calories on. But please do not eat here frequently unless you want a combo of hypertension, diabetes and heart disease.

I hate that this very good Red Robin requires me to cross tolls & drive in NYC traffic from Queens (not to mention that crazy turn around on NJ 3 East).  Why can't the one in Long Island take a cue & be more like this one?  They had space, they weren't condescending jerks & the employees were friendly and accommodating.  Oh, and we were there at lunch time on a Friday afternoon & had NO WAIT AT ALL.

My boyfriend had the whiskey BBQ burger. It came out cold and had hardly any BBQ sauce on it. His fries were cold, too. I had the blackened chicken sandwich which was very spicy and salty. Others sent their food back because their burgers weren't cooked right or there food was cold. One had the ribs and they were dry. We did talk to the manager and he was nice and apologetic.

I've been to a few of these stores and they're all relatively the same, you wait an hour to be seated, you get friendly service and good food for a decent price.  I can't say that I was overwhelmed by the food at this location but I was definitely overwhelmed by the crowds of surburanites, probably due to it being the only one for miles and miles.

I can assume that's were my cheese and bbq sauce went too. The French fries are the ""wide plank"" style and are never cooked enough and this time had a strong onion flavor. They come in little metal rings and are called bottomless. You can order more at no charge but you need to track down your server and then wait for them to be cooked.  My  wife had the crab cake sandwich which says jumbo lump crab meat but in reality is a mushy mess more like tuna from a can.

The steak fries are straightforward. They still give you unlimited ones with your burger, and the special seasoning remains on the table. I've gotten a salad or veggie burger in the past but tonight I opted for a meat burger. It had guacamole, bacon, cheese, lettuce, onions, and tomatoes. I was expecting a hearty, oozy, carnivorous feast. Instead, it tasted like nothing until I hit a bacon shard.  Not worth the calories at all. I ended up leaving half the bun and just eating the unexceptional patty. My diet soda was bitter like they didn't put enough syrup into the machine. My partner said his Peppercorn burger was good. Not the best one ever but not awful. Our bill for two burgers and two sodas was $26 before tip so that's a plus - it is economical. Service was good, too.

We where seated right away and the resturant was not by any standards packed no one at the bar or no crowd considering the game was about to start but having said that maybe its because of the service . We where looking over or menus and our waitress came over and asked of we where ready to order . I asked for a sam adams and my wife got an angry orchard and 2 waters an a wedge salad for my wife and 2 burgers. It took 22 mins to get our waters WATERS ! By the time our beers were brought to the table our glasses where no longer frosted nor was my beer really that cold. At this point we have waited another 15 mins an the waitress comes over and say she is really sorry about the wait but either they lost our ticket or the order was never placed and she spoke to the manager and he was ""pushing our order thru"" The manager at this point should have come over an spoke to us but he didn't . My wifes salad finally came out with no dressing and we had to ask for it .  Because everything was so late my wife could not finish her salad before our burgers where on our table . There was a table of 4 who came in after us ate and paid before we where done .  So as we where finishing up we saw someone  who looked to be a manger and asked if he was and he said yes he was so we started to explain or terrible time here not just this time but the time before this visit and he said he knew our order was delayed for whatever reason because his server told him IF YOU KNEW WHY WOULDN'T YOU COME OVER AFTER WE ATE TO AT LEAST SAY SOMETHING TO US! He told me that we could keep the gift card that we already had been given from corporate because of terrible service last time . I will never set off into this location again with all the burger place that are popping ip all over the place you would think that you might want to make sure your service stands out above others.

Vee H.,"Buffalo, NY",1,82,,4.0,6/5/2012,"I love burgers. Period. So why wouldn't I love this place? Honestly, I usually skip most of the fancy burgers and order the bison or turkey burger. I find that the more I try to add or change - no cheese, medium well, etc - the more mixed up the order arrives. I keep it simple and order the grilled turkey burger nowadays, which is (usually always) absolutely delicious. The best part: chipotle mayo. *sigh. I might ask for some on the side just to send it off for analysis. Really. I know everyone loves the unlimited fries but I've never cared for them here, oddly enough. I LOVE that they now allow side substitutions - I get the coleslaw or side salad with ranch. I'm tempted to ask for the melon but am scared to find out what type of melon Red Robin has lying around? I can't imagine many people ask for it. My complaint: what happened to the spinach and artichoke dip?? It used to be thick, stick-to-your-chip ridiculous good. Now, it's thin, runny and smells funny. I'm not sure what happened to the recipe, but it's awful. I'll never order it again and it sadly used to be one of my favorite starters anywhere. This was one of the few times I've ever ordered something and didn't eat it after just a few bites. Yuck. :P Sure - the place sometimes could use some extra cleaning. The women's restroom on weekends looks like it was hit by a hurricane. It goes without saying - lots of kids if you don't sit by the bar.

We checked the online menu, and it said they'd substitute any of the burger concepts with either a Gardenburger or Vegan Boca burger, so I was actually kind of sold. This is a really decent chain restaurant, no lie. Places like Applebees, Chilli's, Fridays, etc. have AWFUL vegetarian options - this place at least tries to mask the usual veg burger with some cool options. Even the chicken sandwich options could be replaced with a veg burger.  So I got the guacamole ""garden""burger - sans swiss or bacon - and it was really good! My boyfriend and I love to get a run for our money so we got our basket of fries filled like three times each - how many bags of fries must that be?! I ate half my sandwich, and had lunch the next day.  Our waitress kept trying to avoid us because she knew we were fry-thieves, but whatever, the menu was plastered with the fact that they have bottomless fries.

Oriana B.,"Bloomfield, NJ",62,14,,3.0,11/9/2013,"I've been wanting to try Red Robin since that damn catchy jingle invaded my TV years ago...so Saturday night, my boyfriend and I decided to check this one out. Being that it was a Saturday, we clearly had to wait 20 min to get a table, no big deal. When we were seated, we needed a few min before we ordered, which we were given. Once our waiter returned, we ordered our drinks, appetizers and burgers (including how we wanted them done), along with the dipping sauces for our fries. The waiter wrote nothing down which usually impresses me but in this case I was concerned that he'd forget something. 20 minutes later we got our appetizer (the spinach artichoke dip, which was actually pretty good despite the measly portion), and 15 minutes after we were done they still hadn't cleared the table. It was only when they brought our burgers out that they asked if we wanted the plate removed (uh, duh! It was empty and what were we gonna do with it??). For entrées, I got the Big Tavern burger and my boyfriend got the Royal Red Robin burger. He loooved his, but mine was just okay. I was expecting this fantastic ""special"" tavern sauce, but there was barely any on it, so it tasted like a pretty average burger (plus it wasn't THAT big). I'd asked for my burger to have no pink (aka well done) and there was pink. Our waiter also forgot one of our dipping sauces not once, but twice. He actually never brought it out...And my final complaint is that we were never asked if we wanted another drink or given water or anything. So we sat there parched for another 20 minutes before anyone came by to ask if we needed anything else, at which point we just asked for the check.  Bottom line, I'm pretty easy to please, and I'm usually pretty laid back when it comes to service, but this whole experience was very disappointing to me, which should actually say a LOT.

When we got there we were greeted with an enthusiastic wait staff.  They sat me and my 3 friends down immediately and presented us with menus.  They asked if it was our first time there (in which we stated our travel time) and gave us some recommendations. We started off with the tower of onion rings which was stacked tall.  It was also amazing and delicious (and can easily give Outback's Onion Blossom a run for its money). Between the 4 of us we ordered 7 entrees (because we were planning on taking home leftovers, not because we eat like savage animals). The service was fast, and they didn't rush us at all or overwhelmed us with having all the plates arriving at the same time. The manager came around not once, but twice to ask how everything was, and sat with us to give a history of Red Robin, and his gratitude for making the journey over. The drinks were absolutely delicious and the fact that it was indeed free-refills was MIND BLOWING.  There was no way you can get these drinks in Times Square with free refills.  For the 2.5 hours we were there, we must have had 8 refills each (because we all had to pee by the time we got home). We ended the meal with their famous mud pie and a handful of their employees singing happy birthday to us (even though it was not anyone's birthday), but to show just how happy they were to have us there.

Gail P.,"Rochelle Park, NJ",15,17,1,5.0,5/25/2009,"This place gets five stars!! Their burgers are simply heavenly. I mean I die and go straight to heaven when I bit into one!! SOOO delish!! They give you endless fries, but might forget to tell you that so make sure you order extra for the able... they're free!! I really loved the Five-Alarm Burger & Guacamole Cheese Burger. OMG AWESOME!! The wait staff is alittle scattered, but you're there for the burgers not the service!! They also have a full bar too so you can get blasted and stuffed at the same time! PERFECT! Just don't expect a low calorie dinner here, this WILL completely destroy a girl's diet! But, it's so worth it!!! Oh, sometimes parking can be horrible depending on the time you go.. be weary.. P.S. be sure to order the Onion Rings for appetizer.. they come on a skewer, they are big huge and over the top!

Richard B.,"Dover, NJ",1,63,31,2.0,8/11/2012,"This was the first red robin I went to, and was the only one in the area at the time. I was initially impressed and really was pleased with everything. After the location in Rockaway opened it seems like this one has gotten worse. On my last visit with some out of town friends who had never visited a red robin there was a wait to get in, and I let that add to the hype for them. Once we were seated it was a totally different ballgame. The server/bartender rang up the wrong appetizer and the poor runner took the heat for bringing us the wrong food. Once we were finished (2 hours, no wonder there was a wait) we saw the bill had the wrong appetizer that initially came over and laughed it off. We ended up being served by a couple different people, and our original server/bartender was a trainwreck. the game for us became predicting the next time dishes would break. It must have happened 4 times during our visit. Drinks started coming out in the wrong glassware, I even witnessed a server pour more ice in the same glass for a refill. A huge fall from grace. I hope for the restaurants sake that the staff has been fixed in the last year, because I KNOW the food is good, but they just couldn't handle the workload on this night",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clifton?start=160

The restaurant was more then half empty.she told me to give her three mins. Then I waited while her an another girl there were chatting away. 15 more min passed an she never came over to move me. So I was forgotten about. After the waiter came he was kind but a little inexperience. So long story short. Cherry on  the cake was I got my family ready to leave an while walking out I told the girl in the front I'm leaving forget seating me. She said have a nice day. I was so pissed cause one she should have tried at least to make me stay as a customer. This was my second time there. My first was amazing that's why I went back but just because of the girl not giving two shits about the red robin brand don't think i'll go back.

I had the most horrific experience at this location. After being bullied, berated, and humiliated by the supposed manager on site over a coupon (he had on a discolored blue polo and no name tag and told me he wasnt the manager and the waitress was wrong) I stopped talking to him and requested his name because i'd was going to share my experience to corporate. He said he'd be glad to give us his business card. On the way out we asked for it he refused and also refused to give us his name. Police were called and he finally gave me his first name ""George"" (i'll be shocked if thats his real name). He kept telling me not to contact corporate because he's in charge. It was like a nightmare and I honestly thought i was on some Dateline NBC ""What Would you do?"" undercover special. But sadly i wasnt and it was all really happening.

After 20another minutes we flagged down a manager to place our order. We were STARVING so we decided to order nachos as a quick appetizer. Finally all of our food came out at the same time. The machos were cold and no cheese on these. We complained to the food runner and these were taken off our bill. Then we had to find napkins and silverware because we still hadn't seen our server. Then the fire alarm goes off. Loud bells and flashing lights! Magically our server shows up to drop our check. I can't believe I paid for that horrendous meal. I have never complained to a corporate website before,  but I was so upset I did. I received a call on my voicemail a few days later saying hello three times and hung up.
