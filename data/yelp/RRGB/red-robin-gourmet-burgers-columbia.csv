Chad A.,"Columbia, SC",106,197,67,3.0,1/2/2016,"Red Robin is exactly what you would expect from the average sit down burger joint. We had a gift certificate from Christmas and have been to a couple other Red Robins through out the country, they all appear to be very consistent. The deal, I guess, is if you have kids because of the bottomless steak fries which can fill  up some little ones on the cheap. I ordered the spicy ghost burger, and my wife had the traditional cheeseburger. Service wasn't bad, but we both hit the bottom of our beverages more than once. However, they were promptly refilled.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbia?start=20
Ted W.,"Jamestown, TN",1452,251,7,5.0,11/10/2015,"I need to be very honest because I appreciate a good hamburger went in expecting eight another fast food hamburger joint. Came out believing this was probably one of the best hamburger places I have ever been I passed this chain up many times in the past. I decided to start with one of their biggest hamburgers they have I was surprised when they let me change the side to coleslaw instead of fries. Another plus was they let me have it in a lettuce wrap instead of the high carb bun, which is also a big plus for me after the first bite I was sold the jalapeño relish and the freshness of the meat was amazing!!! And they even serve beer WOW ! I will definitely stop in if I see another one of these in my travels.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbia?start=20
Anita D.,"Columbia, SC",0,3,,1.0,3/17/2017,Horrible. One order they put bacon in vegetarian burger and second burger was supposed to be avacado burger but it had no avacado and no flavor either. No cheese and just plain boca burger. When manager came he gave 10% discount for complete mess up of order.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbia?start=20
Michael M.,"Columbia, SC",27,208,213,2.0,10/26/2015,"I actually blame myself for this one. I chose to eat here instead of McDonald's. I would've been better off. It took us more than 15 minutes to place the order for our drinks, because the server was supposed to have our table didn't take it and someone else did. She came back and told us that our server would be the other guy, but it still took him another 5 to 10 minutes on top of the 15. He wasn't a rock star when it comes to doing his job. We didn't get our food for 45 minutes. It wasn't even that busy. You would think having to wait that long they would at least get the order correct. Not a very good situation when you have two toddlers. I don't want to say that it was 30, but I've been to Third World countries that I felt less sketched out eating in. I pretty much had a tackle a server just to get refills for our soft drinks. I finally tracked down a manager who gave us 25% off our bill. I accepted that, but I won't be going back. Generally I like Red Robin, but this one is a no-go!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbia?start=20
Ginger M.,"Ridgeway, SC",49,35,49,4.0,9/7/2015,"I LOVE this place. I always sit in the bar area so it doesn't feel as ""restaruanty"". They have recently done some remodeling however and not all of it is positive. The tables are overloaded with crap! They have added Ziosk to each table which can be great unless you are sitting at a two top. The menu ""book"" is crazy. There are over 15 inserts with menu items and a condiment caddy. Not much room for drinks, appetizer and plates. The four stars are for those damn delicious burgers, jalapeño coins and endless fries.

Gypsy H.,"Elgin, SC",20,14,71,3.0,3/19/2016,"Specifically asked for a table as we have in our party someone who is unable to slide into a booth (disabled). They end up taking us to a larger booth. I said no, and restated that we specifically asked for a table....even a half table half booth would work. We are then sat for 20 minutes while several parties of the same size are sat ahead of us. The hostess was rude, and unkempt...hair greasy and coming out of her pony tail, pants falling off down so we could see her undies...finally were sat at the table.  The server took 15 minutes to come get our drink order. By that time we were ready to order our food. The food took almost 30 minutes to come out. I ordered thw guac bacon with no mayo...there was no guac and extra mayo on my burger, but our server didnt come back to the table even with pushing the server button. Everyone was nearly finished with their food when we were able to flag down another server (several passed but were not paying us any mind). He took the burger, and brought out fries and drink refills for the table. Our server finally came back to the table to ask what was wrong with the meal. She didnt really seem to care anyhow.  The manager brought the burger out but we had requested it to go since everyone was finished....for some reason it took another 15 minutes to put it in a box. Everyone else was happy with their food which is why it gets a three star, and the other server that came to our rescue gave a star boost.... The servers in general need to be more aware of their surroundings and make more frequent trips back to their tables. As a server, you should make sure the order is right before you take it to the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbia?start=20

I'll get a sangria while I wait for the to go order...If Preston is working...he'll take great care of you. The food is pricey for a burger but it's quality food. The ciabatta bread is super fresh & soft. The southern charm is my go to burger!!! For a family of 4 adults with a sangria to sip while I wait is around $60.

Bettie B.,"Lugoff, SC",1,10,4,3.0,5/30/2016,I ordered a salad.  It came with bread. I had to ask for the bread because it was not given to me with the salad..as was described on the menu.  I had to ask for a knife...it took two times of asking to get a knife to cut the chicken on the salad. I ordered tea...it was empty most of the time. The rest of the orders at our table were fine but I was disappointed with mine.  This restaurant was severely understaffed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbia?start=20
Ashley M.,"Columbia, SC",0,9,,2.0,7/23/2016,"Red Robin on Forum, quality is not so gourmet and worth the price. Red Robin, it was o-kay the first time I went, but this time, it was quite disappointing. Yes, I expected my meal to take a little while, but I didn't expect my appetizer to come and be disappointed at the proportion and take forever as well. I was 3/4 done with my drink (water with a lemon) which I sipped slowly. Our main dishes, our burgers took almost 30+ mins or so to finally arrive,because the appetizers orly chips and salsa also took about that amount of time....and well... presentation was lacking. First off, my burger, was so greasy, it was quite disgusting. I couldn't taste the smokey and spices ketchup or even the bacon that was cooked to be crisp. I tried to eat some more, but I just could not even try anymore to even eat half of it. I ordered a side of their fruit dish and it did not look fresh. I ate some of the apples, atleast what I thought were apples. The fruits were gross as well. Overall I was disappointed. Our server rarely checked on us, not even to refill our drinks, and each time he came back he smelt stronger of freshly smoked cigarettes, and that's the last thing I want to smell when I'm eating, sorry, I'm not a smoker, so yes, I'm not fond of this smell. He forgot some of our dipping sauces we ordered and still charged us for it. Our server also took a while to come when our machine went down to pay. The server mixed up our check and dishes as well when we split it with another couple. I believe in tipping a good percent, and we did, even though I felt the service should not have gotten the tip with such a disappointing service. Sigh. What's worse is I got such bad heartburn and sickness from eating even a little bit of my meal, I threw up! Then the other couple we were driving with all said they had heart burn really badly. Honestly, I'm wondering if they use fresh grease or if they overly grease the griddle or whatever because, honestly, felt like eating pure grease where you can barely taste the meat and seasoning. I guess if you like that, this is the place for you, but as for me, I would not return to this red robin again. FIVE GUYS in the area is better priced and tastes better than these burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbia?start=20

Jennifer Y.,"Columbia, SC",167,59,49,5.0,10/7/2017,"My husband and I love coming to this location, for the quality of food and the service. Whenever we go here, whether it's for lunch or on a Friday evening, we're always immediately seated.  The noise level is normally average to loud, as it is a family dining location, but it's still nice enough for date night. We normally always get the same gentlemen, and for the life of me, can't remember his name, but he's great and attentive yet very causal and nonchalant. (Which I like because he's not overdoing his customer service)  I normally always get the same thing because I LOVE my norms. I get the freckled lemonade, black and bleu burger, with fresh jalapeños and the endless fries. The only downfall is the freckled lemonade could use more strawberry flavoring, so often times is watered down quickly. The black and bleu burger is delicious! We come here nearly once a week because I enjoy it that much. It's juicy and fresh, and doesn't fall apart on me. The fries are always hot and right from the stove (or however the cook them). I like to dip them in the sweet and spicy sauce. And my husband likes the orange sauce, which I forget the name.  The cleanliness is good. There's constant business so not all the tables are cleaned off every time but they have a good system going on. The tables aren't left used for too long before a bus boy can come and get to it. So it's great for the amount of business they get.  All in all, I love this restaurant and will keep coming back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbia

Robert A.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,2,,1.0,10/22/2017,"To call what they pass as ""service"" is to do a disservice to service. 1 1/2 hour from seating to food in an almost empty dining room. Go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbia
Britt L.,"Columbia, SC",67,103,10,2.0,7/4/2017,I have passed by this location for years and never tried Red Robin so today was a first and last. There was no host at the front to seat us and there were three employee who looked and walked by us and just continued on their way. Almost ten minutes later the host shows up with an apology. We were seated at a unusual booth between the kitchen and the restrooms and this was the only one awkward booth and there were plenty I MEAN plenty of other booths and tables to sit. We asked to be moved to a booth near the window. The window area need much attention. There were dead flies and other insects around the blinds and along the bar by the windows was also very dusty as well. I liked the fact that I could order my veggie burger (soy based or garden rice and cheese) with any type of burger option with the veggie burger being substituted. The endless bottomless fries were not told to us until it was time to pay for our bill. The wait time for the food was less than 15 minutes. They are very stingy with the garlic cheese and herb topping that you pay extra for on top of your fries so if you are order that topping ask for extra and more EXTRA because they will on sprinkle it on for it.

Anthony G.,"Columbia, SC",0,8,,4.0,7/15/2017,"Bear with me to get to the good stuff. This location has been mediocre for a while now. However, we continue to dine here because we like their menu and the cooks are usually not the problem. I have yet to see a manager out doing table touches in four years which I believe is their biggest issue. If they don't spend time in the FOH it allows the crazies to run they asylum. We eat here twice a month. Our previous four trips have been 2 stars on service and 3-4 on food. Today we Brittany as our server. My one and only critique for her would be to stop and say hi to her new table on your way by. She was at the table next to us when I was seated. She was caught up with them and went to the back to get them something. This put our greet time at a little over 6 mins. At about 4, I start get impatient. A quick hi calms all of that down. She was wonderful! Happy, smiling face the entire meal. Took our entire order at the first greet per our request without missing a beat. Drinks came right out. She nailed 2 of my pet peeves the whole meal. She kept the adults drinks full and she asked if the kids could be refilled. Root beer and pink lemonade are only when we are out as a treat, normally its milk. Outstanding! For the first time in 5 visits my food came out correct. No cheese on my burger and BBQ on the side. Sounds easy I know, I used to think so too. However, it took Brittany to finally get it right. Pre-bussing was good. Asked about dessert. Thanked us and invited us back.

Jihan S.,"Columbia, SC",0,50,21,3.0,7/10/2017,Took the kids out for lunch here on Sunday. It was about a 5 minute wait to be seated. Upon being seated the floor and seats were still dirty. Fruit was still on the floor and a wet mess and seeds were in my seat and of course I sat in it without noticing it until my pants felt wet. It was obvious that only the table surface had been wiped off before we got there. The host didn't even bother to check that the booth he took us to was clean and I was not offered a better table by the waitress when I asked her for a napkin to clean the booth. I'm guessing her section was full smh...Service was slow. My house salad was served on the tiniest of plates making it difficult to mix the dressing without lettuce falling onto the table. I asked for a larger plate twice and it took forever to the point where I started trying to manage with the small plate. I finally got one after eating about a quarter of it. What happened to the long rectangular plates that they used to serve salads on in first place? I shouldn't have to ask for one. I also had to keep asking for small things such as lemons and refills as it seemed to get forgotten the first time around. The BOTTOMLESS fries were tiny portions and very slow to come out. My sweet potato fries were also slow to come out. The only highlight was the coupon I had for a free mega shake with a $10 purchase for being a rewards member. The waitress had it split into two to-go cups which I thought was nice so the kids could share it. The couple next to us asked for A1 sauce and a guy who was not their waiter brought back a small cup that had a hardened mess in it which shows that he didn't even check to see if the sauce would be satisfactory before giving it to the customer. Everyone seemed to be in a hurry but didn't take the initiative to ensure quality. Our waitress was nice but busy. She tried her best to check on us but it seems that the service here is going downhill and the basic needs of the customer are not being met.

BeenThere D.,"Orangeburg, SC",0,6,,2.0,2/22/2017,"I went to this place today with my family.  Was charged 9.69 each for the simple cheeseburger for my two kids...  Endless fries is really a joke because they give you like 6 pieces of fries when you ask for extra.  We wanted to order one of the Smoky Jack Tavern Double(6.99).  (The waitress insisted that we get the big version of the burger.)  The Big Smoky Jack Tavern(8.99) was suppose to be a bigger burger based on what Shenitra, the waitress said, however was given a one patty burger.  My husband did enjoy it none-the-less but it wasn't bigger when he could of saved 2.00 and gotten the two patty burger.  If I ever take my kids back, we would all order water and I would be creative to keep the cost down because why charge kids 9.69 for a burger and you barely wanted to come back to give us the 6 piece fries when you could have easily rung them up for the Red's Tavern Double Burger with sauce on the side for 6.99.  Plus let's not forget the advertisements for the 6.99 double cheeseburgers.  Why have these advertisements if it's not true.  Now lets get to my burger.  I just wanted a simple burger with grilled onions and mushrooms.  I have experience being a server and I normally would do whatever it takes to make sure that I took care of my customers so I will not apologize for the review.  Tip should have reflected the bare minimum 10% based on service.  You seem friendly Shenitra but you need more help involving how to keep your guest just as happy as you seemed.  I liked it better the first time I came to this location back in November 2016.  Although we hated the burgers, the guy waitress was amazing.  She could really learn a thing or two from him.

Everything on the burger from the sauce to the nice onion burger buns had me anticipating each bite. The bottomless fries were a bonus as they were perfectly seasoned and tasted really good with ranch and ketchup.  My only complaint was that our server, although nice, seemed aggravated that we capitalized on the bottomless fries twice and just said ""OK"" when we gave him the money along with the tip as we were leaving.  I would definately go here again to try the other burgers and entrees, some shakes and some of their unique alcoholic beverages in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbia?start=40

While it cant bring back that family Sunday night, at least it shows they care. If you get bad food or cold food let the manager know.  After a great experience last year. Took 40 minutes to bring our food after being ordered. Drank three drinks while waiting. For our food. Some of the food sat under the lamps for a very long time. Of course most of it was lukewarm or cold. Had to order more fries to get hot ones. My wife didnt want hamburgers so she ordered a prime rib which cost 14 dollars and it was a grey meat deli meat grey something about as far from prime rib as could be. The manager did give my wife her money back, but by then her dining experience with our family was ruined. A very bad experience. And to make matters worst we has a 13 month old baby with us.

John B.,"Columbia, SC",1,5,1,1.0,12/16/2014,"My girlfriend and I were excited to learn that red robin offered a vegan burger. However, the boca burger was by far the worst vegan burger either of us have ever tasted. It was dry, overcooked, and utterly flavorless. I forced mine down only because I was so hungry, but she sent hers back and ate fries instead. Our server's response was accusatory, as though to say ""well what did you expect"". We've had plenty of juicy, flavorful, delicious vegan burgers elsewhere, so be warned that this is NOT the place for them.

Kelly P.,"Winterville, NC",3,3,1,1.0,8/30/2015,"Would give Half a star but it wasn't possible. Let's start with checking into the resturant, last name is Pierce  (how many ppl think that's hard to spell?) Well the lady put it in as Pears (which we didn't know) so of course when they called that name we didn't answer. So we waited an extra 10 min to be seated that wasn't necessary.  Fast forward to seating, our waiter talked A LOT more than he should have at the beginning of the meal about nothing  (the resturant,  the little I pad looking thing on the table, his kids etc) not that I don't care but we were traveling and was kinda hoping for a decent yet quick meal. Anyways it seemed that this particular  server had wayyyyyyyyy more tables than needed. We waited a long time to order which again added to the already not great experience.  When food came out most of it was wrong, the lady who delivered the food looked like she could've cared less, bathroom  was nasty and ONLY had hot water(not good for me or my 4 year old).

Stephanie D.,"Columbia, SC",12,52,3,5.0,7/18/2011,"I had a bad experience here not too long ago. Why the five stars? Just skip to the last paragraph to find out. This a portion of the 'essay' I wrote to corporate after I left: I came into the restaurant STARVING. When I was seated, it took longer than expected to be greeted. It was 5 minutes at most, but long enough for us to choose entree so we could order straight away. Our server came to greet us and asked us for our drinks. The drinks arrived in a timely manner. As she placed our drinks down, she asked if we were ready to order our entree. I ordered a burger meal, a root beer float, mac and cheese, and a kid's corn dog meal. I also requested a basket of fries while we wait because of my hunger pains.  Rather than checking on us afterwards, she was tending to other duties in the kitchen like refilling ice. The basket of fries and the root beer float never came while we waited. In fact, our server never visited us until she was ready to give us the entrees. This meant I never had a refill on my drink during the wait.  I had hope she would remember my float, so I waited until she checked on us the second time after she gave us the meal. After I had mentioned the root beer float, she went to the bar to get it. It came without the shaker and the ice cream in the cup was melted. The drink felt like it never had ice cream in it- it wasn't very cold at all (which is expected after waiting for nearly 30 minutes). She apologized for forgetting the drink, but didn't offer to replace it. I was already angry about not having the fries to calm my hunger pains. I was even angrier because I was expected to pay for the sh-t of a root beer float.  The only right thing about the food were the fries. They were HOT. Everything else was cold and had hardened. The bread on my sandwich was hard and dry as if it sat out for a while. Hard enough for me to turn it into crumbs by just rubbing it. The meat was barely warm. The cheese on the mac and cheese was hard, dry, and nasty. I had the mac and cheese here before, and this was NOTHING like it. That had obviously been sitting out for a while. After she dropped the meal off, she left the check and told us not to hurry without asking if we wanted dessert.  ... (the 2 paragraphs on what they did to fix the problem)... My experience that day was TERRIBLE at first. I left very happy and even willing to come back to ask for Brittany. I will definitely recommend this place after the complete turn around in service because customers who do happen to have a bad experience can come knowing their problems will be corrected. Even though this comment is filled with more negative things than positive, I want to thank Jason and Brittany for allowing me to leave full and happy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbia?start=40

Red Robin is an awesome burger place, but they serve other sandwiches, salads, and such as well. The burgers are slightly more expensive than what you'd find at other restaurants, but their size and bottomless steak fries  to go with them more than make up for that.  Drinks are great too, whether you're getting alcohol, flavored tea, or freckled (strawberry) lemonade. if you like onion rings, this is the place to go!

The building is also kept very clean, even the patio. There are balloons available for the kids or for parties, and a nice bar for the adults. Sometimes the balloons pop because of the weak material, but the hostesses are usually good at not popping them. There is also a ""surfboard"" behind the bar, where the kids can sit and talk while the adults have a drink. Every Tuesday and Thursday the Red Robin mascot appears to entertain the kids as well. The food is amazing, and is always hot and fresh. They have awesome appetizers, such as the towering onion rings. My favorite is the Salmon Burger. They also have soups, salads, pastas and wraps. There is also a Garden Burger, for the Vegans, and the Lettuce Wrap Your Burger, for those on a low-carb diet. The drinks are great and they have a large selection. The Freckled Lemonade is my favorite (Minute-Maid lemonade with strawberry flavoring and strawberries on top). They can add strawberry, almond, vanilla, peach, and raspberry to any drink you order. They also have tasty milkshakes and smoothies. Their desserts will blow you away!

Food: The burgers here are enormous.  I love the royal robin.  The fries are unlimited here so munch away.  The appetizers are pretty good their famous one is the big onion rings.  Other than their burgers they have a variety of shakes which are all delicious.

Dave R.,"Columbia, SC",18,8,16,4.0,1/13/2011,"First of all, As Magnum P.I. would say: I know what you're thinking, and you're right. What business is it of mine, a vegetarian to review a burger joint? Well Mr/Mrs Smartypants, it just so happens, and is actually the main reason for all stars, that you can substitutes a Veggie Burger or a Boca Burger for any of the other ""real"" burgers on the menu. And yes, there is a difference between veggie and Boca burgers.  Anyways, the food here is great. Although for me, even though I'm a 6'3"" 220lb linebacker, I still recommend the smaller portion meals, if for no other reason than to save room for the amazing milkshakes. And speaking of milkshakes, it's basically TWO milkshakes as they give you the leftovers in the tin that fill the glass right back to the top. Now, I must mention the bottomless fries that come with each order. Alhough the idea of bottomless fries is great, and the fries sure delicious, even with the smaller portion burger I've never been able to really take advantage of this perk...probably due to that delicious milkshake I mentioned earlier!  So to wrap it up, get the milkshake even if it means you have to get most of the rest of your food to go!! Oh ya, and FYI, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is b/c I always feel a little sick after I eat there, not because of the food, but because a combination of me eating to much. I firmly believe in the whole ""everything in moderation"" deal but for some reason I can't practice what I preach at Red Robin. Is it fair that my glutinous ways cost RR a star?
