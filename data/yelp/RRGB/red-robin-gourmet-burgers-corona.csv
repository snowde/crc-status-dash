Autumn L.,"Riverside, CA",204,116,161,3.0,11/10/2017,"We were ushered into the bar area; which is fine because there were no children in our party. We ordered food, it came out in a semi reasonable amount of time.  Their drinks are ok; I ordered a lemon drop martini it was a bit on the sweet side and I believe lemonade was used instead of lemon juice & powdered sugar. Lemonade is super sweet for me. I'm more on a tart kick than sweet.  Our food was correct and tasted fair. We will return to this location",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-corona
Joseph V.,"Santa Ana, CA",57,5,2,1.0,7/19/2017,"I love Red Robin. This location has horrible service. I sat in the bar area so I saw interaction with kitchen staff as well as staff coming up to get drinks for the rest of the restaurant. Lots of comments were ""I'm so glad that table left."" They had a rush of phone orders and it didn't seem like anyone knew how to work the phone.  There were what looked like employees who were off the clock hanging out in the kitchen area not in uniform. There were also employees touching their hair and blotting makeup coming out of the kitchen area.  Specifically one employee had a negative attitude the whole time and make many negative comments about work and was demeaning to other employees. His name was Daniel.  On a positive note Britney was pleasant.  Hopefully management steps up their game at this location because what I saw tonight was far below par from what the rest of the company is producing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-corona
Mrs. B.,"Riverside, CA",21,116,86,5.0,12/7/2017,I am highly impressed! I haven't been to RR in over 10 years because of the poor customer service. I decided to give it another shot and my goodness it was AMAZING!!!!!!!! The food was fresh the service was great. My waitress was Andrea and she was such a sweetheart very attentive and so sweet.

Laura L.,"Ontario, CA",71,94,17,5.0,12/27/2017,Our family of four were seated very quickly and served by Hunter. She took our drink orders promptly and we ordered very quickly. Our family was super hangry and we were very surprised when our food came out in less than 10 minutes of ordering. Food and service were amazing and we are glad we stopped in. We were planning to go to the one at the mall (parking was horrendous) but it was worth the extra few minutes of driving to come to this location for the great service!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-corona

Jim E.,"Redondo Beach, CA",30,626,,2.0,5/8/2017,"Food was OK, however the service was sub-par, it took an extraordinary long time for our food to arrive, people that sat down after us got their food before we did, had to wave the waiter down for everything, they never came back to ask if we wanted more fires,   Maybe it was because we sat in the bar area, maybe not who knows,  Manager needs to work on the speed of service and or the kitchen staff and do some training to have customers checked on during the meal",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-corona
Katelyn W.,"Redondo Beach, CA",81,85,115,2.0,4/16/2017,"Best Suited Occasion: Family, Friends, Kids Gluten Free: They have burgers that have gluten-free options. Experience: The waiter was extremely helpful. In fact, the people working there are helpful and friendly. But the food was cold and undercooked. Maybe it was just a rush, but for it not being too busy this isn't what we expected. Also, the fries were hard and cold, maybe due to the ""bottomless fries"" in which maybe this should be off the menu if they can't cook these items properly. Cleanliness factor there was gum on the table, the seats still had crumbs, and the restroom had a particular smell that is not too appealing. I do hope this is not too harsh only in the hope that as a business these features may change for the better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-corona

I came in thinking it was about to close but I enjoyed myself and with no rush eating with my family whom wanted burgers and also waiting till I got off work.  Samira was great, she was all over the place...wasn't sure if she was the bartender, server, or manager but she was friendly, pleasant.

Varinia R.,"Riverside, CA",63,40,53,2.0,11/19/2017,"I received an email from Red Robin if you ordered carry out, you would get 35% off your order. Of course I jumped on that deal. I went to the restaurant at the time they said my order would be ready. Tgere was a lady in front of me also waiting at the bar for her carry out. I want to say she had to wait like 10 minutes and she finally got her food. But they forgot her drinks, so then that took another couple minutes. It looked like they were really busy and weren't prepared for all the carryout orders. They brought out some food afterwards and left it on the counter. I wasnt sure if it was mine since more people came in and were waiting for their carryout as well. I waited for like 15 minutes and had to get a waitress' attention to ask if that order was mine and turns out it was mine. At no time did  anyone ever acknowledged me to say sorry for the wait. They also forgot about my drinks and I had to try to get someone's attention so I could get them. You would think I would of received something extra for the inconvenience or at least an apology....but nothing. When I got home, the burgers weren't hot and they forgot the jalapenos I paid extra for on my husband's cheeseburger.  I called and spoke to a manager and she apologized and said they weren't prepared for all the orders and offered to send a giftcard for the amount I spent. That was nice, but wished I had a better experience at this place and wished the staff there was more attentive to the customer. I haven't returned to this location because of that, but I have gone to the Riverside location and received excellent foid & customer service there. So I now go that location only.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-corona
Brandon S.,"Chino Hills, CA",589,224,188,1.0,4/17/2016,"We called in this Red Robin to place a pick-up order. A woman named Jolie answers and takes our order of 9 sandwiches and burgers. She then asks if we would like drinks. We reply ""no thanks"", and she literally said, ""greeat, now I have to go sell 9 drinks to someone.""  So it's obvious Red Robin has a drink-to-meal ratio they are graded on. Like a quota I guess. But this was the WORST interaction I've ever heard of from a restaurant employee. Why would you say that to a customer?? But wait, it gets better. To keep up with her quota, she put 9 waters on our order. See the picture below. We won't ever be back to this Red Robin again.

Lorraine P.,"Orange County, CA",3,45,4,1.0,10/14/2017,"The restaurant was not busy at all and had several tables open. There was a couple ahead of us who was waiting for a table and we were still told 5-10min wait. I'm not complaining about wait time it's the fact that with so many tables open we still had to wait?

Donna W.,"Costa Mesa, CA",16,5,,1.0,7/21/2017,Called to place an order to go and they automatically put me on hold. Drove over to the restaurant while I was still on hold and was told where to go to place a to go order. Was told they would be right with me. The person walked by three times and never acknowledged me or even tried to take my order. The funny thing is all I wanted was fries with a variety of dipping sauces. A very simple order!

Jacob R.,"Corona, CA",57,34,11,4.0,3/29/2016,"I took my lady to this place for an early dinner/ late lunch, and we had received great customer service. We sat at the bar, and was immediately helped by the bartender. I had ordered a type of BBQ burger and it was beautifully prepared and presented, paired with a Lagunitas IPA and I was set.  The only issue I have was that when using the rewards program, if you have a promotional item (for instance, a BOGO) there is no warning or heads up from the server. Though this might not be an issue for some, it was for me as my lady and I knew a family member with one and decided to have my meal count towards her account as we don't come here often. Looked at our check after we signed and completed the transaction to see the burger came off (meaning, instead of helping the family member, I took their reward from them).  Other than the reward issue, I still highly recommend this establishment for both a family outing or dinner date, nothing beats the tasteful gourmet burgers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-corona?start=20

Go somewhere else. I'll never step foot inside again.  Beware of the old lady bartender Jolie, she is the most rude and pushy bartender I've ever met. She loves to brag about how she's been there for 24 years but she will give you a dirty look and ignore you if you order water. I can't believe management let's her walk around the place and behave so rudely. We asked if we could please get some fries before our meal. We were greeted with a ""I'll see what I can do"" from across the bar. This isn't the first encounter we've had with her being extremely disrespectful. I'll NEVER be visiting again because of her. Hopefully management wakes up and realizes in a competitive industry like restaurants, a rude and disrespectful employee can cost a lot. Go somewhere else where they care how the guests are treated.

He was phenomenal! I myself am a server at a restaurant and I am guilty for silently critiquing other servers when I go out. Daniel was everything I could ever ask for and more in a server. Polite, reliable, EXTREMELY personable, hard working and always on top of everything. My partner ordered one of the bottomless drinks and never once did he have to ask for a refill because Daniel always had one immediately on the table. He was also always busy doing something and not standing around. His suggestion for putting the cold sauce on the side of my hot burger instead of on it was so helpful.

Norma A.,"Corona, CA",0,7,6,1.0,8/28/2017,"First time in this restaurant as we usually visit a different Red Robin. Our family Came in here on a Tuesday night for dinner. It was around 7:30pm and the restaurant was super slow. It was my husband and 3 kids. We ordered our drinks: Husband asked for a ice tea. Waiter never offered any kind of sweetener and by the time he walked by, my husband was in a bad mood to ask him for any. I ordered a lemon drop martini. It tasted more like lemonade and the rim of the glass didn't have any sugar like a real martini is suppose to.  The food came and it wasn't any better. My husband ordered a bar-b-q burger. It was missing the bar-b-q sauce. My chicken wrap looked more like a street taco than a wrap. My daughters fruit looked like it was soaked in water and our fries were hard and staled. Just gross.  Last but not least and the icing on the cake, there was a huge cockroach walking in the kitchen. We got sat in the back right by managers office and we had a view of the whole kitchen. As soon as we got sat down, I got an iffy feeling about this restaurant. Worse part is an employee was pointing it out to the female manager and she ignored her. It wasn't until I told her; you have a cockroach walking in your kitchen did she go back, but all she did was look at it. It wasn't until we also pointed out to our waiter and that's when he went over there and stepped on it. To be clear it was a water bug cockroach so when then waiter was trying to step on it, it started flying trying to get away. SO GROSS!!!

The food my wife's wrap was fine.  But our french fries were raw and only luke warm.  I went with a simple burger wanting quality over quantity.  What I got tasted like anything but beef.  The quality was so bad I could not finish it. The wifes happy hour drink was s watered down she could not finish that.  It was good they had machines to pay at or we might still be waiting. The one star is for my wifes wrap.  We have been there before and expected better.  Yes we have been there before but in my world you dont get 3 strikes your out.

The bar wasn't even busy.    My husband had the Royal Red Robin Hamburger with Chili Cheese Fries and it was pretty good. I had the clucks and fries and it was also good.

Stephanie Q.,"Irvine, CA",122,111,431,3.0,3/19/2016,"So like any restaurant, the one thing that messes up a meal is cold or over cooked food. Unfortunately this time, we experienced both. My grandmother's food came out cold but our waiter, Blake, took it back and the chef brought out a fresh hot plate for her so that was great. Later we found out that Blake even got it taken off the bill for us, which not everyone does so that was appreciated. My moms burger was well done but like super well done to the point the meat was pretty dry. Blake recommended the burger though which she enjoyed other than the over cooked meat. My wings weren't exactly saucy or crispy enough, but I ordered boneless wings and sometimes that can be a problem with those. I have to say that for an appetizer size, they sure gave a lot of food.

George T.,"Corona, CA",8,30,33,3.0,8/23/2015,"This use to be an awesome place to eat (pre-2010). The service was amazing and the burgers were 2nd to none. We would drive about 15 miles from home, 3 or 4 times a month just to come here for lunch or dinner.  Now fast forward 5 years. We stop in once in awhile, usually as a last resort. This place has really changed for the worst. The restaurant looks old and rundown, there doesn't appear to be any type of upkeep, bulbs at tables are blown out, service is terrible, and the food comes out so so so slow......sometimes dishes come out 5 minutes apart from each other. So I can expect to get my food just as my kids and/or wife are finishing their food.  You have to pretty much wave down a server just to get your drink refilled.  To make matters worst we stopped in today because we were in the mood for a burger and fries and we were told there would be a 25 minute wait because all areas were full. I then pointed out to the hostess an entire section of 6 open booths with enough seating 24 additional diners and she replied ""we are not using that section"". Really? Not using that section even though you have 10 people (that's not including the people that walked out the door when told about the 25-30 min wait) waiting 25-30 minutes to dine at your establishment?!?!?!?  This is most likely out last visit to Red Robbin......there's just too many other locations to dine to have to put up with this type of service or should I say ""lack of"".

Now, l hate using the race card and I never do but I would say this is the first time I ever felt discriminated against of because of my ethnicity... there were Anglo Americans in front of our booth and in back of our booth and noticed that she was attentive to those tables, she'd asked  them if everything was good and if they needed refills.

Will H.,"Corona, CA",16,211,,2.0,2/26/2016,"This was my first visit to any Red Robin in about 15 years and I had high hopes.  Let me give you the rundown on the good and the bad.  First the good: 1.  Excellent and speedy service by Travis. 2.  Super yummy mini tower of donuts with chocolate and strawberry dipping sauce. 3.  O.K. burger and fries (with cheese dipping sauce @ $1.19 surcharge). 4.  Good strawberry margarita. The BAD: 1. NO utensils from either of 2 servers who were helping me. Man, this is Service 101. 2. Happy Hour margarita half the size of those Mega gulp cocktails served right next door at Applebees, and at a lesser cost.  WHY? 3.  Kitchen forgot to add my caramelized onions on my burger, which, at $13.45, was grossly overpriced for a chubby burger and fries.... . 4.  Like many male servers these days, mine kept calling me ""BOSS"" every 30 seconds, which annoys the Hell out of me and many customers, particularly those of us who are senior citizens. For some reason this BAD HABIT of  using these nameplates like Boss, Bro, Buddy, Dude, etc. has become the norm at 75% of all restaurants I go to.  WHY?  What happened to ""Sir""....the only really viable greeting?  Have these servers been watching too many episodes of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives with the flippant Guy Fieri?  Where are the managers with the teaching of proper server etiquette across the country? In fact, where was the manager at all at this location, as I never saw one nor did one ever greet me at the table. 5. 3 of the 4 TVs in the bar area did not have the captions running, which makes them just about useless for the customers.  It was only after I mentioned it to my server that an attempt was made to correct it.  Just lazy workers and management who may have seen this situation for months or years and never bothered to take 5 minutes to correct the issue and play multiple choice with the remotes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-corona?start=80

Christina G.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",131,62,78,3.0,11/17/2014,"Decided to try this red robin as it would be my first time eating here and I had a gift card so why not. Ordered the teriyaki chicken burger, no teriyaki and add thousand island with a side salad with a house balsamic vinaigrette. requested a water with lemon to drink. Simple order.  Whelp, was brought an iced tea with lemon. I didn't want to be a stickler so I took it as it was, I figured since it wasn't a busy Sunday night, I could swing for a water in 15 minutes when she checks back on me. 30 minutes later, no food, waitress is walking around, joking around with some very loud and very drunk people in the corner, and serving drinks at the bar. 15 minutes later food arrives, but a different waitress brings the food. I ask her for a water with lemon , she obliges - never shows up. My waitress finally comes - with food in my mouth. I motion to her another iced tea. She says okay. I never saw either again till the check. Boy was I upset and dry mouthed.  I give this three stars because the food was good. The chicken breast was juicy and savory, well put together and was delicious. the salad - they need to refrigerate the tomatoes. you could tell they were sitting out and acquired a funky taste and smell.  I wont be returning to this Red Robin, but I will try another one in hopes of giving them a five star rating, including service.

Brodie D.,"Riverside, CA",31,6,6,5.0,12/27/2014,"Red Robbin, well theres not much to say about this place besides that its probably one of the best places to go out to if your looking for a gourmet burger with bottomless fries and drinks for around 15 bucks. Plus great appetizers and entres if your not in the mood for a burger.. Ive been here plenty of times and enjoy every dine in. The burgers are cooked to perfection however you prefer,well done, medium, or watever. Theres plenty of burger combinations to choose from wether it be spicy, bbq, or just an old classin cheeseburger, plus your create your own choice. I highly recommend getting the freckled lemonade as a drink if your not a soda drinker like me, the drink is sweet full of strawberry pieces and just thirst quenching. And if your into spicy get the Burnin Love burger. Its a good one.. Not much more to say.

The guy behind the bar asked me if I'm here to pick up an order to go, and I tell him I would love to be picking up my order but I'm actually still on hold to place my order because no one has picked up the phone from being on hold.  He says ""no problem, I can take you order right now, what do you want."" I'm flabbergasted that he's not at all concerned that I've been on the phone holding, Who is in charge of this place?

However, we moved to Corona last year, and being the Red Robin lover that I am... we came to this location to eat twice. The first time wasn't great. Service was slow, unfriendly, and the food came out blah. This restaurant is never that full... so that can't be the issue. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and came back again another night. Service was EVEN WORSE. Food came out soooo slow (I am talking about 30-40 minutes after we ordered in a mostly EMPTY restaurant) and it was cold and bland. At that point we vowed never to return to this location. I happily drive an extra 10 minutes to go to the newer Red Robin at Tyler.  Perhaps management changed between 2005 and 2014.... but whatever happened... This location and staff should seriously reevaluate the way they run their business.

Teri C.,"Las Vegas, NV",1629,1012,2245,3.0,12/22/2010,"I'm not the biggest fan of chain restaurants, usually I go for the stand alone businesses where I hope there's a bit more heart and soul in the food. However, on a recent drive back from Southern California to Vegas, we stopped in Corona for a bathroom break and gas.  It was dinner time and there weren't too many restaurants showing up on the Yelp app.  But a quick tip referring to ""Free refills on root beer floats!"" at Red Robin attracted my eye.  I called them up to confirm and it was very much true! We were seated in one of those smaller booths right when you walk in and immediately ordered the Root Beer Float ""A mug of hand-drawn Bottomless soft serve with Bottomless Barq's® Root Beer."" ($2.99)  Apparently, there are other drinks that are bottomless as well, not just the root beer floats.  The waitress quickly brought them over, along with an extra mug of root beer.  Yum! The Husband ordered the Red Robin Gourmet Cheeseburger ""The Original upon which we have built our fame! Garnished with crisp lettuce, fresh tomatoes, pickles, onions and mayo. You choose your favorite cheese: Cheddar, American, Swiss, Bleu, Provolone or Pepper-Jack.  Make it truly Original -- add Red's pickle relish."" ($8.79) When you see this burger, it's a real burger.  It's huge and loaded and has all the fixings that make it a real burger.  Plus, it comes with their bottomless steak cut fries, which I really dig as well.  (I also read a quick tip about having them put garlic and cheese on the fries.  We asked the waitress about it and yep, she brought over a basket of fries with garlic and parmesan cheese on it.  Nice!) I ordered the Classic Creamy Mac 'n' Cheese ""This dish is the big cheese. Our take on classic mac 'n' cheese has swirly Cavatappi pasta tossed in a creamy four-cheese sauce, topped with more gooey cheese and baked to golden brown. Served with warm garlic focaccia bread and a side salad."" ($8.99) Ultimately, I didn't eat my mac 'n' cheese, rather I finished up the salad and packed the rest to go.  I was busy working on my second round of Root Beer Floats!  Yep, when I completely finished my first, the waitress brought back another round for us both.  Sure, not the smartest choice to be consuming so much liquid while you're on a road trip, but it was darn good!  An interesting tidbit is that they include the nutritional value fact sheet right on your table!  So, you can get an idea of how many calories and fat your lunch or dinner is going to be, you may rethink most of your order! Overall, Red Robin is what it is.  If you love burgers, then you might really like this chain.  I like steak cut fries, and when they are endless, it works for me.  Bottomless root beer floats are always a plus too!  It's generally your all-American fare though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-corona?start=80

We both had burgers--my husband had the royal red robin and i had the burnin' hot burger. It doesn't even matter whether it was good--the most important thing is that we both got TERRIBLY ILL from food poisoning the next few days!

Drew H.,"Corona, CA",0,9,,1.0,4/21/2014,"I hadn't been to a Red Robin since I was about 7 years old but I went with my parents just to get something cheap for lunch that was just a step above fast food drive through - the reality is this is worse than drive through food and it costs almost twice as much. CONFUSING AND BULKY MENU: Almost 12 pages printed front and back with ads and promotions stuck in-between each page to make it even bigger. Even our waitress was confused because the menu missed details and placed items in the wrong sections, you could tell she was bothered by it and the fact that it's so massive and full of promotions instead of actual menu items - not to mention had to be turned like a book yet didn't have page numbers so you couldn't tell someone where something was. FROZEN, CANNED AND ROTTEN INGREDIENTS: The tea here is all made from syrup so it leaves you with a lingering, syrupy  aftertaste with each gulp (every other beverage has sodium/sugar). My mom likes sweet potato fries so she payed almost $2.00 extra to have those with her order instead of the regular fries. Her sweet potato fries initially looked good until we ate them and realized they weren't fried recently, they were just reheated and then they served them to her cold - my mom doesn't cook much but even she said she's had better frozen fries at home and that wasn't even her insulting the food, that was her being prideful of the fact that she can cook better than someone who is fully employed as a chef.  My fruit salad was basically half of an apple that had gash marks and dark brown blotches all over it like sticks had been jammed into the sides.The pineapple they claimed to be ""fresh"" had to be at least 5 days old as it was limp and soggy, it's not hard to tell when fruit is fresh if you eat it every day. The strawberries in my fruit salad were the same frozen strawberries they put in beverages so.. yes, that means they were pale, bloated and squishy. I didn't even try a bite of it after I saw the BROWN, WILTED mint leaves on top - you have the laziest chef ever! The main entree item I ordered was a turkey deli sandwich... Was I expecting something rotten and oily? No. You can tell when deli meat goes bad not only by the way it smells but by the way it tastes. It will have a liquidy coating to the meat which only brings out the pungent foul stench which is exactly what Red Robin's had. I gagged after two bites and had to stop - I am a big guy at 6'5 tall and I had an appetite before we got here but after I tried their food I lost my appetite and demanded a refund (which I got quickly because the waitress agreed that my food was gross - I didn't order anything else). If you are the owner of this franchise please sell this property and allow a better cafe to come in, this place is an embarrassment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-corona?start=100

Khanh P.,"Riverside, CA",40,30,15,5.0,4/14/2014,"I've only been here twice. Recently, I went to this Red Robin for dinner and it was pretty empty for a Thursday night. We were seated within 10 minutes and we had a waiter named Blake.  Blake was a really tall guy, so he had to squat down to take our order. He folded his arms together and leaned over our table which was pretty unorthodox to me. I felt a little awkward, but Blake was very interpersonal with his job. He took our order and our drinks came out promptly. About 10 minutes later, Blake comes and brings us a basket of fries and says ""Here's something to start you guys off"". I was really surprised and happy that he brought our fries as a sort of appetizer before our meal. I was really impressed.  The one thing I noticed about this Red Robin was that it actually had male waiters. Not to sound sexist, but I do prefer a male waiter, because of style of waiting. Blake took the initiative on a couple of things during our meal, such as bringing us a cup of water when our cups were almost empty, asking to bring dipping sauce when he saw that we were almost out, and etc.  The burgers were delicious and the fries were fresh. Blake made my meal very enjoyable and I would come here over the one in Tyler.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-corona?start=100

There is never a manager in sight. Does a manager even work here? Their ""bottomless"" fries are total BS too. You get 10-12 fries with your meal and if you want some more you must wait 10-15 minutes for the server to return and then another 20+ for him/her to bring you back some more fries.

I asked the waitress if we could have this booth . She said no there's no kids allowed. I said why is that kid sitting over there then . She replied "" ya he shouldn't be up here either . I took a deep breath and said ok thanks . Walked over and this old white hair lady clearly had her head up her ass 3 groups in front of us and she could not do jack squat with out checking every thing first and still couldn't figure shit out . Then we are all standing in line like you do at restaurants and the dumb shit says ok who's next . Everyone looked at each other like this lady is a dip shit .

I ordered two entree's. Remember one adult and one child under 3 years old.  He placed the sharp knife in front of my child......I took that away. And the hottest plate in front of her. Are you freaking kidding me?!?!  I moved both plates to the side and asked him to get me an empty plate for my daughter. He came back with a small bread and butter plate. LoL Hello, commonsense???? I didn't say anything but managed it without having to use that small little bread plate.  Right after I was served he dropped the check on my table. At least let me eat half way!! Well, he came to see if I dropped my credit card in it......I didn't because I wanted to order their chocolate dessert for my daughter. He came back twice to see if I paid............ he tried to clear my table as I was feeding my daughter....... I just had enough....... I asked, ""dude, at least give her a chance to finish her food. Are you in hurry?"" He knew what he was doing......didn't have an answer but said, ""no, no-- I am sorry"" and walked away.  A minute later a female server came to me and said, the other server's shift is over so I will be taking over.""

Olaa C.,"Corona, CA",2,8,,1.0,2/5/2013,"Seriously there are so many things wrong with this location but the main problem is the so called ""management"" corporate needs to come in and clean house! As I have always enjoyed clucks and fries I was beyond embarrassed for the the staff and other guests having to be in an establishment where the manager's are so unprofessional. I choose to have my birthday dinner here which was the biggest mistake from even walking through the door. I reserved a table for 15-20 people yes I called very early in the day spoke with a morning manager which was very pleasant, I did not want the restaurant to be understaffed on a Friday night as we walked in. My friends and family showed up at 6:50 reservations at 7pm I got there at 7:20 and was told by a hostess that they stat four ladies at the end of my added on table. Never mind the fact they knew a big party was coming in they still would not admit fault for not seating properly. The first manager that I spoke with (Julie) was so incredibly rude I was shocked how she even became management as clearly she had no business being given that title. Her ""accommodations"" were to sit half my party there and the other half over there at different tables and when the four ladies left we can all move again and sit at our original reserved table. Haha NO that's not how things are done! We had five children under the age of seven musical chairs was not an option or even a logical solution to the screw up. After squeezing our party of 18 people literally inches away from the ladies of four they became rude as well since we were so close due to seating. Yes we were given appetizers 3 that took 45mins and were burned. Then as we ordered 1 hour later 16/18 orders were wrong, ,cold, burned or raw!!! Raw chicken sandwich was ridiculous! We could have gotten very sick! How about the brown stuff that was on the steamed broccoli??  We were informed that was because it was in the microwave to long. Fresh fruit? Ya not so fresh looked like the strawberries were taken from the bottom of someone's empty strawberry lemonade, gross. When we asked to speak to the manager again they sent over (Melissa) who I'm 98% sure was the kitchen manager haha another joke! Was so argumentative and also unprofessional. Blamed us for all the terrible food because she claims when it left the kitchen it was ""fine"" fine is not good enough!! Mind you these four ladies NEVER moved or left in fact went out of their way to prove a point that they were not leaving (4 hours total). When we asked the manager to just give us our check for our beverages so we could leave and go elsewhere to feed five starving kids at 9 o clock at night she said she could remake the food but we had to pay for it! Comical right?! Especially because those four ladies had there food comped due to there complaining we were to close and they felt rushed, cant blame them hostess nor ""management "" ever took blame for seating them there. The manager comes back AGAIN saying she would take care of our drink tab lol of cokes and what not if we left now! Apparently we were harassing her staff and guests. All untrue as our server (Suzanne) was great leaving with a $40+ tip I actually felt sorry for her that she has such poor management that does not have her best interest in mind. If this establishment would have taken responsibility and take fault I'm sure everything would have been different. Coming from the restaurant world and being a training server for a professional corporate restaurant its a shame other restaurants do not put the customer first because at this location the customer is not right! And management will become unglued faster than then were able to serve horrible food followed by the WORST customer service I have ever seen!!! Great birthday right??!

Shalene C.,"Riverside, CA",75,59,27,2.0,4/5/2010,"After years of smelling Red Robin from across the Walmart parking lot, I finally decided to go.  Well, actually I got a free burger coupon for my birthday, so that had a lot to do with it.  I ordered the Royal Red Robin burger that has cheese, bacon and is topped with a fried egg!  I love fried eggs so I knew it was for me.  As I ordered, I told my server I would like my egg over easy.  The point is to get the runny yolk all inside the burger, right?  WRONG.  Apparently, the cooks at Red Robin are not allowed to serve over easy eggs because they don't have some sort of warning posted.  Sounds like BS to me, but whatever.   I should have gotten a different burger because the yolk  was cooked all the way and the cook didn't even bother to salt or pepper my egg.  The bacon was skinny and limp and looked like that nasty microwave ready bacon you can get at the grocery store. All I can say is thank goodness it was free because I might have had to complain if I was paying the usual $10.   Another thing, our server who was very nice and helpful (read smiled a lot and came by every 5 minutes) completely disappeared after leaving our check.  I finally had to take it up to the bar and asked someone else to charge it.  my card didn't work, but instead of waiting for me to get another one, she took off.  I had to ask YET ANOTHER server to charge my bill.  I should have been a d*ck and walked out without paying, but I'm not like that.  So, the verdict is burgers aren't that great, way too expensive and not worth the extra money you'll have to forfeit to a server that does half  job. My advice?  If you have a grill, go to Stater Bros and buy one of their gourmet burger patties and grill it yourself.  Then you can cook your egg however you want!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-corona?start=180

A little messy but worth it.  I would recommend that or the bbq chicken wrap. I usually get that EVERY time I go.  This is one of the few places that show the prices of alcoholic drinks on the menu. That is a good and a bad thing, because it stopped me from buying a margarita, but then I bought a 6 pack of beer at the Vons next door for the same price! ha ha I was feeling cheap, what can I say.

J M.,"Foothill Ranch, CA",95,268,50,1.0,8/8/2011,"I normally love Red Robin....but this location was such a disappointment.  I was so unhappy, I started Yelp'ing while I sat and waited for my check card to be returned to me....obviously took a long time since I got to Yelp a lot!  Before I get in to my story, let me tell you about the people next to my booth who ordered their food at the bar prior to getting a table.  They ordered appetizers, which took twenty minutes to be brought to them.  When the group tried eating their appetizers, all three orders were cold.  So the server took it back to be reheated or recooked....I don't know.  What I can tell you, is that it took the manager over ten minutes to come by and apologize for the problem.  Truthfully, if I was that party I would've just left.  The manager explains the reason for the cold food is because they moved from the bar.  WHO SERVES COLD FOOD?  I've frequented this location a few other times in the past, although I believe this last time was my first check-in.  I wasn't too impressed with this branch, but our final visit to this place is just that....our final. I'm pretty good about giving a company a second chance; and I did so with this Red Robin, only to be more and more unhappy with the food and service.  Our server initially started out great.  She was sweet, very out going, making it easy to talk to her.  I ordered the Banzai burger with a side salad instead of fries.  When asked what dressing I wanted, I requested a creamy balsamic if it was available.  She happily said that they had this dressing, and that it was delicious!  The hubby ordered the Whiskey burger, and for my little one, we ordered the children's pizza.   I received my salad first of course.  The salad didn't taste very fresh.  Actually, it tasted like the precut and washed bags of salad at the grocery store.  If you buy the ones with romaine and iceberg lettuce, you can sometimes taste something funky in it.  THAT was the flavor of the salad that I was served.  The dressing ""looked"" like it was a balsamic, but tasted more like an Italian dressing....as much as I LOVE Italian food, I don't like that dressing.   The food finally came out, brought to us by another staff member.  Hubby got his burger, and I got mine.  The lady who brought the food, called mine a cheeseburger as she set it down in front of me.  I look at my burger and see why she mistakes it for a cheeseburger.  Our waitress comes by to confirm that my food was correct, although I don't know how she knew that without looking.  My bread felt like it was toasted a while ago, edges were hard.  The entire burger looked like it just sat under a eat lamp for half a day.  The pineapple looked stale, and wasn't juicy at all.  I've always loved Red Robin's Banzai Burger, but this was just terrible.  I was so unhappy.  As I continue on with my Yelp review, I sit in disbelief because I just realized that I NEVER thought to complain about my burger...probably saw the movie ""Waiting"" too many times and instinctively complain after the fact.  The sweet potato fries were super salty, and my little one's pizza was sopping wet with marinara.  Because of the soaked bread/dough my child wouldn't eat her pizza and opted for daddy's burger instead.   After our main course was done, nobody came by to top off our drinks or ask if we wanted anything else.  We finally get our check, we wait for fifteen minutes to go by without a visit.  My husband had to go find someone to give our card to, so we could get going.  Then, ANOTHER fifteen minutes go by until the card was returned to me for my signature.  All this waiting...I was so irritated, I decided to Yelp it right away!   After this last experience, I highly doubt I will ever return again.  Maybe it was a bad day for them?  Who knows?!   What I do know is that visits that get progressively worse, are good enough signs for me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-corona?start=180
Katy B.,"Corona, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/6/2014,"So I live by yelp reviews but have to be honest and don't write many myself. But this evenings experience at red robin requires one. Our family absolutely loves reb Robin . But this is no ordinary red Robin..... it's the worstttttt red robin ever.                                                                      We were super surprised that on a Friday night at 730 we came in and there was hardly anyone there. My first thought was awesome we picked the right night,, no, everyone else just picked a better place to eat. And even tho the place was empty we still waited 10 min due to lack of .....? Well I still haven't figured that out. Anyhow to make a long terrible story short... The wait after ordering once we finally ordered was ridiculous.  The fries were rewarmed not fresh. And I'm not too picky believe me. But it was that noticeable. Limp, cold, soggy fries, with a hint of microwave heat and you got urself an awful basket of fries. My Cole slaw had tortilla chips in it. (No they didn't belong there), I ordered a margarita... um that was pretty much just lime juice. And the waitress.  She must have called me sweetie and hun 30 times... my son and I made a game of counting them out of boredom and to soothe our growling bellies. Normally if ur old enough to be my mother or even close go for it and call me whatever pet name u need to but I'm pretty sure she was younger then me. Probably in her mid twenties. That is just annoying. It drives me nuts. I think that's how she attempts to get on the customers good side but there are many more ways to go about that.

One time, my guy found glass in his soda because the glass apparently broke. The beer is flat, and they're too lazy to change it. We are constantly waiting for refills on drinks or fries. We rarely complain when we go out, but they are just asking for it. BUT, the manager who has received our complaints is very nice. He tries his hardest, but some of the servers are just bad.

So we left him what we thought he deserved, which was a few cents. All he did was bring out drinks and our check, which he threw trying to be funny or something but we were offended.

Cat L.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",194,402,496,3.0,8/30/2007,"Not a bad place to hang out. I mean, I came here when I needed a change of pace from Applebee's. There isn't a single patch of white space on the walls filled with framed photos and posters symbolizing American pop culture, like Marilyn Monroe, airplanes, Fred Astaire, Statute of Liberty, etc. Coupled with the glow of neon lights scattered about and cushy red booths, I really get that old fashioned diner vibe when I'm here. The food is good but a bit overpriced for what you get, I think. It's your average American fare but I like the clamstrips, onion rings, and mozzarella sticks, basically, anything DEEP FRIED is good there. In terms of burgers (their specialty), I prefer the Burger Parmigiana and the Banzai Burger, though I think Island's makes a better Hawaiian burger. Most of their entrees come with bottomless steak fries but it gets a bit annoying when they only give you like 5 fries at a time and they make you feel like a fatty continually asking for your basket to be refilled. Don't forget to hit your fries with a bit of their seasoned salt on the table. Red Robin is also known for its drink concoctions, like freckled (strawberry) lemonade, raspberry limeade, and such. I like their blueberry pomogranate limeade, but it's one of the seasonal drinks they don't always offer. But ask!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-corona?start=200

jason a.,"Corona, CA",41,6,,4.0,11/20/2010,The food is great the service is pretty good.  Every now and then you get someone who disappears for a while...but the food keeps us going back.  Kids love the atmosphere and getting a balloon at each visit.  I think the the mini arcade needs an update though.  Seems the games are continuously out of service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-corona?start=200
