Dign G.,"Seattle, WA",132,28,232,5.0,12/19/2017,Not sure why this place has such low ratings! Came here after realizing that our group of 14 people would have to wait an hour at the location near the outlet collection. They took our reservation while we were in Auburn and said itd be about a 10-15 min wait. When we got there we werent seated right away but we didn't have to wait for long.  The waitress was so lovely! She'd make jokes and was very patient when people would change their order last minute. Her jokes weren't lame or the type that make you feel kinda awkward like at some other restaurants.  I guess the food did take a while to come but that's reasonable considering we had 14 people. It also didn't feel too long since we had one another to talk to.  Food was good but didn't expect that taco tavern to be that small seeing how big it looked in the menu. It was actually pretty filling though. My boyfriend and I shared it & it came with bottomless fries. Waitress was very nice about refilling our tables refillable drinks and bottomless fries. Sometimes other red Robin locations make you feel like you shouldn't ask (?)  It was a nice experience & was a friendly atmosphere overall. They also gave free desserts to the three people in the group that we're celebrating their birthdays!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-covington
Bradley D.,"Seattle, WA",7,131,75,5.0,11/9/2017,"I am baffled by so many of these negative reviews but I'm noticing a trend. The VAST majority seem focused on the orders that are for pick up, which tonight we didn't do. We walked in around 7 pm and were able to find a a larger corner booth for four people! It was even a Seahawks game and the bar was busy! We sat in an area where a young woman named Kiera (red hair, glasses, from Illinois, three kids!) was serving us. She was super bubbly and very cheerful! She was so so so kind and came right over! We knew we wanted milkshakes, a beer and a prickly pear lemonade! (Those lemonades are so delicious!)  After we got drinks, waters and she was back to take our order. Even with how busy it was we got our in 20 minutes! It was stunning. The buns were perfectly crisped, and I'm sorry but the fries were HOT! I even asked for the plate of sauce selections and she giggled because I seriously LOVE Red Robin sauces! Between the four different burgers we ordered we were so impressed. On a super busy Seahawks game night, it only took 1 hour and 16 minutes from start, to us paying to get out and feel completely satisfied! My mother was so impressed, at the close of our meal we got a chance to chat with Kiera! She lives in Enumclaw and seriously LOVES Washington! I was so impressed with how she connected, smiled every time she came to our table, was able to handle all of her tables and really make tonight's experience something to remember! WE WILL BE BACK!

Andy P.,"Seattle, WA",1,43,,4.0,10/22/2017,"I'm not a big fan of chain hamburger places (except 5 Guys).  Red Robin tends to offer ""gourmet"" burgers that are difficult to eat.  They're also a little pricey.  Having said that, I was favorably impressed by this location.  We've now moved to Maple Valley, so this is ""local"" for us. The occasion was a fund-raiser for the PTA at the school where our daughter works (let's hear it for community involvement by local businesses).  A big ""Plus"" for RR is that they are very responsive to food allergy issues (our grand-daughter has severe peanut and egg allergies). Everything went as expected.  The kids' menu was nutritious and offered good choices (our grandchildren are ages 2 and 5). My wife and I ordered the ""Keep it Simple"" -- or something like that, burger.  It was very good, and I enjoyed it.  The price was under $10.  It includes the choice of some pretty good steak fries or a fruit salad. For a beverage, I ordered a ""Guiness"".  That was a mistake.  I asked the server what temperature the Guiness would be.  She didn't know.  Temperature is very important with Guiness, or any other serious stout beer.  I ordered one, anyway.  Expecting a draft beer, I instead received a can of ""Guiness Draft"".  Some Irish person should be very ashamed, as this wasn't really a Guiness.  The flavor was very weak.  I dunno if it was related to post-brewing storage, or just being canned beer, but it wasn't real Guiness. In the way of background, I'm not a beer snob.  Most of the beer that I drink at home is ""lawn-mowing beer"" -- whatever is cheapest at the store -- think Busch or Milwaukee's Best.  Typically, all I want is something that is cool and refreshing.  I order better beer when away from home, and keep a stock of good beer in the refrigerator, for company, and my occasional indulgence.  My advice to anyone who appreciates good beer is to order something other than Guiness here.  It was a big disappointment. We were pleased to note that my grand-daughter's allergies were listed on the meal ticket.  RR also has a pretty decent frequent eater program.  I gave them my daughter's number, as they eat here more frequently than we do.  I canceled our account when RR insisted on spamming me nearly every day.  They refused to stop spamming me while I had an account with them.  Clearly, they have a much higher opinion of their e-mails than I do. The solution was simple for me.  BTW, the proprietary spice jar that they offer as an inducement to sign up -- it's not very good.  It ended up in my garbage can. RR isn't my first choice for dining.  However, I do very much appreciate the chain's sensitivity to food allergy issues.  I know that we'll be dining here in the future, because there are few restaurants where our daughter and son-in-law are comfortable taking our grand-daughter to dine.  There certainly are much worse places to eat -- the King County Health Service provides guidance in that area. Food inspection results are very important to me.  I generally refuse to eat at restaurants that aren't worried about poisoning their customers.  I'm very happy to report that this location has an enviable record.  Other than an issue in 2016 about cold holding temperatures, they've an excellent record of concern about our health.  Thank you, Covington Red Robin's manager.  I appreciate restaurant managers that are actually worried about not poisoning me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-covington
Krissm A.,"Federal Way, WA",128,317,1903,3.0,11/17/2017,Came here fo a birthday but it was too busy. The server was great. She didn't introduce herself but was quick and responsive.

Kari H.,"Vancouver, WA",0,36,17,1.0,10/7/2017,"We are regulars at this location. Actually, after last night, make that WERE. Several times over the last year we have received French onion soup that is too salty, fries over cooked and cold, and just overall messed up orders. But we kept coming, in part because of a couple servers in the bar.  Last night I went to pick up a to go order and was abruptly told it was at the hostess area now.  What? There isn't even a register there!! Wait... it gets worse... The stack of to go orders was huge! And they were all siting there and getting cold while ONE hostess was doing everything. Seating people and taking one To-go order and running clear to the back of the restaurant to ring up an order and then coming back to do that for the next person and so on...   I of course knew my fries would be cold, so I ordered more hot fries. (the lady next to me was worried her entire meals would be cold.) When I told the manager this was a colossally bad idea, he just basically said -thank you for that feedback--- Basically wrote me off as not important. I had to ask for hot fries a second time and yes, when I got home, my meal was ice cold.  Oh and I love the new to go containers that do not retain heat in any way at all and politely suggest you can ""reheat"" your fries in the oven.. hello? If I wanted to fire up the oven I wouldn't have gotten a ""to-go"" order! $31 bucks for a cold meal?  No thanks.  Peace out 185th RR.   We will happily go to the new Issaquah location. At least they seem to have things under control and we have never had problems with an order there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-covington
Blake B.,"Maple Valley, WA",42,1,,5.0,10/11/2017,"Excited to write my 1st yelp review! No one store has ever deserved it more than this particular Red Robin. The food speaks for itself, I only now wish we would have taken photos to give a visual. However, that's not why I went out of my way to write this review. We had a waitress tonight that just completely raised the bar for an experience we have never had before. This waitress is named: Jourdan!! Please people if you want excellent service, this lady carries excellence like a badge of honor. She seems so genuine as if she walked in integrity daily and she was a lot of fun!!!! My friends and family will definitely come back. Please show this person some blessings. Thank you, Jourdan!

Jeanne W.,"Alexandria, VA",1,16,3,4.0,7/7/2017,My burger was cooked perfected. Some pink.  I also had the simple salad with grill chicken.  That was great too.  I have to say some Red Robin Restaurants are better then others.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-covington
Bri J.,"Federal Way, WA",66,142,18,3.0,9/15/2016,"Ultimately, this Red Robin experience was slightly less enjoyable than others I've had at other locations. I came in with a friend at 4:30 on a Tuesday. Our server was Kierra, who was extremely patient with my friend and I taking forever to order. She was quick to bring fries, and helpful with checkout. My only nitpick of the experience was they did not serve my Royal Red Robin burger with a knife. And I needed one ro cut it so the egg wouldn't drip all over me. It took me awhile to flag someone down to get one. In the past, the knife has been standard. So maybe being sure to include that would help other patrons of the future. Red Robin is always delicious goodness. Predictable, but definitely yum. I'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-covington

I won't comment on what started the boycott - I feel that wouldn't be fair (but know that it'll never leave my memory). We ventured out to the Covington RR for a family member's birthday. The waitress we had was super nice, but very scatterbrained. She forgot to bring my drink, forgot to make sure somebody's regular fries were subbed with garlic fries, and other small things of that nature. Despite those small issues, the chicken tenders I ordered were pretty good, but I've had better.

Bridget S.,"Auburn, WA",0,77,,1.0,5/26/2017,"Did not have the opportunity to eat. We were told it was a 20 minute wait - understandable - it was busy. After walking in to ear splitting screams of several unattended toddlers, I specifically told the greeter we would be fine sitting in the bar. She replied that if a table opened up, she'd let us know. After standing for over 20 minutes - a couple who had arrived 15 minutes after us walked into the bar, and after a conversation with the individual clearing the table, returned to tell the greeter to remove them from the waiting list. They'd found a seat in the bar. Thanks, no thanks, I didn't realize it was up to me to grab my own table. If I intended to go that route, I suppose I could have eaten at Costco.

Bruno B.,"Seattle, WA",23,76,157,4.0,12/31/2016,"For a straight up burger, as a vegetarian I can only only talk about this fare.

I appreciate that they've taken the time to remember me. I also work in customer service, so I understand how hard it is to do that! The food is great, and what you would expect at RR.

Heidi L.,"Maple Valley, WA",0,29,9,4.0,6/8/2017,My husband and I have eaten at enough Red Robin's to know that typically the food is consistently good. The service is what changes the experience for us. We have cut back on visiting this location because of the service and cold food. Our server today was Genna and she is (no pun) a gem. She checked in us with without hovering and just had a sunny disposition. Food was exactly as we have come to expect.

T C.,"Kent, WA",0,4,,2.0,5/31/2017,"Tonight we tried ordering online, which was simple and we could pay online, which made it easy to order and have it picked up on way home. Unfortunately Red Robin either does not check their orders or do not care to give you everything you request. I requested crisp fries which were soggy. I asked for 4 campfire and 3 ranch. I got 2 of each. I also asked for seasoning, utensils and napkins which we received none of.  The Mudd Pie came as ice cream only. No sauce or whip cream, which is funny because I had the options of adding extra or none at all. I didn't realize you had to ask to have it prepared like the picture. When I checked my receipt, which was stapled to the order it listed everything I asked for or should I say everything I wished for. Disappointed they couldn't get the order correct, but not surprised since whenever​ I've called in an order they never get it 100% correct.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-covington

I'm paleo so I order my burger without a bun in a lettuce wrap, and fries are a cheater luxury for me. In the past Red Robin has done okay by me, so I thought this place would be a good ""half-cheat"". Wrong both times I went. The burger was small, poorly built, and they didn't even wrap it in lettuce either time, as requested. Also, their to-go ration of fries is laughable. I paid around 12 dollars for a joke of a meal both times. I won't be going back there ever.

If you don't mention they don't bring.  The waitresses are pretty slow and seem to not care sometimes. Especially at night. Usually the bar manager or other waitress are amazing!

No matter which location, no matter what time - the burger is always cold. It doesn't make any sense. I'm not a big fan of sending food back so I always just eat the cold burger with a disappointed look on my face. The sad fact is they do make the best burgers in town, and don't even get me started on their buffalo Cajun clucks. Delicious. But why the cold burgers??  It's disappointing and downright un-American. And I'm not alone in my critique - last time I asked a friend of mine if you wanted to go to red Robin with me for lunch he said their burgers are always cold.

Jenna S.,"Lewiston, ID",24,45,95,2.0,9/21/2012,"Normally I have a better experience at this location but this evening wasn't that great overall.  The guacamole we received with our chips consisted mostly of a full avocado.  Have you ever tried to dip chips into a full avocado?  Doesn't work well.  My waitress did replace it, however, the second batch wasn't much better. My salad was terrific.  I tried the harvest chicken salad for the first time.  No complaints at all.  However, the bread served along with it was literally so hard I couldn't bite into it.  It's not normal for your food the clang against your plate louder than your utensils. To top things off, our waitress took over 25 minutes to retrieve our payment after leaving our bill.  She wasn't very attentive through out most of this visit and we noticed her giggling and gossiping with the cute Ken Doll guy in the kitchen area.  I wish I could remember her name.

Sandy T.,"Kent, WA",1,7,,1.0,12/4/2016,"I have been very disappointed with Red Robin Covington's ""to go"" orders.  They have failed me on at least 3 occasions.  About a year ago I ordered a cobb salad.  When I got home it had no bacon and no avocado.  I called to complain and they told me they would send me a gift certificate, but they never did.  More recently, on my birthday, I stopped to pick up a black and blue burger, with ranch dressing for the fries.  When I got in the car I sampled the fries.  They were already cold.  When I got home, the burger was a mushroom burger.  I don't like mushrooms and they gave me tartar sauce instead of ranch dressing.  I threw the whole dinner away.  I immediately called and talked to Brandon.  He was less than empathetic.  I asked what he was going to do to make it right?  He reluctantly said he would send a gift card.  I gave him my address.  It is now Dec. 4th...and I'm still waiting for that gift card.  I have not been back to them since.  I now go to Hop Jacks up the street in Maple Valley where they care about their guests.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-covington?start=40
Marty S.,"Kent, WA",0,58,,1.0,1/8/2014,"Red Robin Is Going Down Hill They used to have free birthday dinners....eliminated. They used to have $5.99 sandwich and salad entree specials....eliminated. The sandwiches are better than fast food and the steak fries are unlimited; if you want to look like a fat pig eating greasy french fry second helpings a lot. The only bright spot for a $10 crowded/noisy burger joint bar/restaurant like this is their ""smallish"" $6.97 Tavern Burger and the Tuesday Seahawk bogo on this Tavern Burger. Then they offerred me their loyality card farce. Ya buy 4 more meals [within a month mind you] and can get $20 off the 5th visit....if you register from their website.....which BTW, doesn't work anyway. Its rigged. Eat at the IHOP near by.....$10 will get you a better selection dinner entree and big bowl of potato soup thrown in too.....an automatic bogo on two entrees too, if you're over 55. IHOP has occassional entree bogos with two beverages too.

Sherri Hubbard E.,"Maple Valley, WA",6,25,25,4.0,5/12/2015,"I would actually rate this experience a 3 but other visits keep them up at a 4. There were a couple of slight issues but for the most part everything was great at this location. Clean and seated promptly but it was early and not busy. Now there was a huge party table so I understand completely the couple of things that went amiss. No water, napkins or utensils. They did get them of course and very apologetic which was unnecessary but refreshing all the same to not be treated as though you inconvenienced them by having to ask for it. The food was fine. I had the crispy chicken salad so it is hard to mess up. My only issue with it was that normally the chicken in it is usually better. I have ordered them as take out and gotten better. It was still not ""bad"". They were very kind and accommodating which can make all the difference in the world!

Antoinette C.,"Maple Valley, WA",0,12,,4.0,7/14/2014,"My family loves their burgers and they are kid friendly, so we had lunch here with our visiting family member.  I don't typically order a burger while dining in...too messy and obscene to eat in front of others, but for some reason, I didn't care this time...I ordered a D.G.B. with a side of steamed broccoli and fried mushrooms/sweet potato fries combo to share. The first batch of sweet potato fries came out burned to a crisp...I asked for another batch that was served their vibrant color and perfect texture. My burger was cooked to perfection, had a very nice ""caprese esque"" flavor, and the steamed broccoli was refreshing to have to lighten up the heavy burger. Our guest had the usual Whiskey River BBQ burger that lived up to all her yummy expectations. She said the fried onions were cooked to a perfect crisp. Our son was very happy with his spaghetti order from the kids menu.  Hubster changed it up and ordered the seafood mix platter with fries rather than his usual WRBBQ burger...it didn't pack the flavor and texture punch that the burger usually does, so he won't be doing that again. Service was awesome. I would have given them 5 stars if they didn't send out a burned batch of sweet potato fries...anyone who looked at that basket would have clearly seen that there was no trace of orange color to be found...horribly burned. Our table was clean, high chair was clean, side plates weren't as clean as I'd like, air conditioning worked on a hot day...overall great dining experience.  We ordered red velvet cake  and cheesecake with strawberries to go...had them for dinner and couldn't eat anymore.

I began watching the orders pile up and just sit there so I timed it on average every order sat there for 9 minutes before being brought out to the tables.

Pat M.,"Kent, WA",0,54,1,4.0,8/10/2013,"My spouse and I meet for dinner here fairly often since the location is convenient for us both between work and home. We think the Covington Robin experience has become a little on the hit-or-miss side.  When it first opened, the food and service seemed very uniform and we often would see the manager in the front of the house checking in with the diners to be sure everything was good.  Now we sometimes encounter mistakes with the food, the staff seems less attentive, and I haven't seen a manager walking the floor in a really long time. Having said that, they still (usually) make good burgers, decent drinks, and good non-burger alternatives, and the prices aren't bad for a full service establishment.  The all-you-can eat fries that come with the burgers are a good thing when you are feeling famished, and if you visit regularly, you'll be well-treated by their loyalty card and the discounts it brings. Get a big booth in the bar and you won't have to hear the ear-splitting kids that always seem to flock to Red Robin.  In closing, here's some Red Robin trivia: ""The original Red Robin stood at the corner of Furhman and Eastlake Avenues E. in Seattle, at the southern end of the University Bridge. This building dates from 1940 and was first called Sam's Tavern. The owner, Sam, sang in a barber shop quartet and could frequently be heard singing the song ""When the Red, Red Robin (Comes Bob, Bob, Bobbin' Along)"". He liked the song so much that he eventually changed the name to Sam's Red Robin.  In 1969, local Seattle restaurant entrepreneur Gerry Kingen bought the restaurant and expanded it. The business dropped the ""Sam's"" and simply became Red Robin.""   -(courtesy of Wikipedia)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-covington?start=60
