steven c.,"Seattle, WA",17,4,,2.0,3/10/2017,Uh never again... What happened to the old Robin??? Place shouldn't be called Red Robin!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-des-moines?start=20
Sharlene G.,"Des Moines, WA",69,8,5,2.0,7/29/2017,"We are regulars and service is always hit and miss.  Today's service was blah, the guy was not focused, like we were a burden and he had other things to do.  I don't know if waiters realize that they are can make or break an experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-des-moines?start=20
Kelly M.,"Renton, WA",10,36,4,2.0,10/4/2016,"So here's the deal, for the last year or so I've come here about twice to three times per week for lunch.  I was a regular.  My service was always good, food was usually good--I mean it's Red Robins, it's what I'd expect.  Plus they always knew me and knew I didn't want to sit at the bar and I like Root Beer floats.  Until lately. Then within the last few weeks, they went thru a rotation of employees and the young friendly staff at the hostess stand was replaced by a older lady who hates her job.  And I mean this woman really hates her job.  Every time I came in, she'd invite me to the bar and I would tell her I don't want to sit in the bar, I want the dining room.  Then (every time) she'd scoff at me for taking her valuable time and seat me at a table.  It got to a point that I felt like I was going to the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld.  Now I don't feel I should have to explain myself, but the reason I don't sit in the bar area is because I am wearing my company logo and I don't want people to be telling my boss I was drinking during lunch; secondly, I don't like high tables--if I do something stupid, it is a much farther fall to the floor from a high top table than a booth. But my last visit was the last straw.  I came in on 10/3/16 at or about noon.  The place was practically empty.  There was no hostess, standing up front, hating life, so I figured I'd just sit at the bar so I wouldn't have to waste the her time.  I sat for about 10 mins while the female bar tender was on the phone.  When she saw me, she came over 5 mins later, I got my float and then I ordered a bowl of soup and sweet potato fries (simple stuff right?  After all it's note even busy).  She left me for 20 mins and my bottomless float was no longer bottomless.  So for fear of running late back to the job, I had to skip my lunch, and leave.  I did offer to pay for the float and they said don't worry about it.  So at least my not-so-bottomless float was free. I'm going to give these guys like a month to fire the folks they got working in there or retrain them.  Then I'll come back and try again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-des-moines?start=20

Matt W.,"Seattle, WA",1,1,,2.0,6/29/2017,"It's a red Robin right? Classic americana in a super casual almost cafeteria style. We've had good experiences here before with decent service and okay food (with kids there are not that many options in sleepy Des Moines) but tonight we ordered to go. Since the order was placed online the item list should have been clear...But we ended up without our drinks, silverware, and even dressing for the salad. The chicken BBQ wrap had a large bone still in and was undercooked. The salmon salad had wilted lettuce and didn't come out of the kitchen until far after our scheduled pick up time. Not terrible bit not the best experience by far.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-des-moines?start=20

Amy T.,"Phoenix, AZ",187,74,61,1.0,7/27/2016,"Man if I could give zero stars I would.  The only good thing about this place is they just updated the looks of it so now it's not crusty, more sports bar-y. But nonetheless it's still dirty... Sooo idk this restaurant looking nice is even a ""pro""  I used to go here for everything as a kid. After school concerts, birthday parties, family dinners. It was a place to get chicken tenders and play video games (which they no longer have btw) and I was a little kid. Didn't take much to please me then.  But now I HATE this place. The wait staff sucks so much, the food sucks even more, and I have had far too many ""this will never happen again"" moments here. Nuh uh this place deserves zero stars. The worst and last experience I've had here: my mom ordered take out for my family and I (just me, my husband, my mom, and my dad). I had just had a baby so I was hangry and tired and wanted a Groovy Smoothie from here cuz the couch was extremely comfortable at the time. Clucks & fries for my husband and I to split, a Groovy Smoothie, an order of fish n chips, and a bacon cheeseburger.  K she called it in and they said 20 minutes but we've ordered take out from them before and it's more like 45 min. So she went after a half hour and sure enough the food was not even ready. At all. She sat in the bar (that's also where you have to pick your food up) for a half hour before the dumbass brought her the food. She just took my moms debit card and handed the stuff and didn't say anything. She didn't have to sign anything which was weird and she asked the lady, ""is this all?"" and the stupid waitress told her yes. Note: my mom didn't check to make sure the order was right at this time. She was tired af of waiting and you really shouldn't have to check. But yeah. When she got home she was giving everyone their food but there were no clucks & fries :'( None. But guess what there was instead? A box with literally 4 fries in it. Four fries!! That was the dinner my husband and I were supposed to share LOL LOL LOL omg. Everyone else's food was correct. Except the smoothie I got was only filled halfway in one of their to go cups! And the to go ones are small as it is so I'm positive that's not how much you'd get if you sat down and ordered it. It's normally huge. But whatever.  She looked at her receipt and she was charged for TWO clucks & fries. But she received NONE! And she ordered only ONE! So wtf. She was pissed because she felt bad because it was food for me.. She went back and they gave her an order of clucks & fries but she had paid for two and brought in the receipt and everything. I'm sure she was screaming at them by then because they're so. fucking. stupid. here. I can't say it enough.  But some guy who was the manager came to talk to her and gave her a $10 gift card... Hahahahah like no. She took it and I'm assuming stormed outta there.  Bitch, please. That $10 RR gift card has been sitting on the desk and will probably get thrown away. We're never going back here.  *****this is just one horrible experience but there have been too many to even write about. Like the time when another table was given our order from someone random in the kitchen who brought it out and then after it was put in front of those people it was given to us. EW EW EW stop. Or the time my husband and I got food poisoning and could not stop puking our lives away hours after eating here. Nahhhhh. It may be one of the only big restaurants in Des Moines but just don't. I hate this place, don't eat here.*****",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-des-moines?start=20
Monica T.,"Seattle, WA",161,189,36,3.0,10/6/2016,"Really hit of miss with the service at this location.  The first time I came in the server we had was amazing!!!  She took our ordered quickly, checked up on us during our meal and made sure we had our check ready when we were ready to leave.   The last time I came in, we were seated for about 15 mins before our server came around.  She even helped a table that was seated after us first.  We had to flag down the hostess to let her know our server never came over.  After she took our order we never saw her again.  Super annoying because I was sitting there with a empty water cup and needed a box for my food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-des-moines?start=20

It took for ever for them to answer the phone I had to call in 5 times until they actually picked up. Order 4 burger meals , when one of my coworkers pick the food up he literally said he had 'to pull teeth' to get some campfire sauce and ranch. He also asked to get some extra fries with our togo order and they totally ignored him. When I actually got to eat it. My burger wasn't even wrapped all the way and my fries looked awful.

What a mistake. I will say that our server Rena was absolutely wonderful in every way. But all the great service in the world can't turn swill into gold. I guess I'm not alone because when I came to this Yelp page to write my review I was besieged by a mountain of 1 star reviews. I won't get into details, but the food sucked and Rena would truly flourish at a better quality restaurant.  She was the only shining star.

Service is really bad... took 6 min until someone acknowledge I was sitting there. After I finished my drink, I decided to move the cup to the end of my table where 9 times a server, bus, bartender walked by and didn't once ask if I need refill. When I asked for a refill for my fries, they didn't ask me. Second time I ask for refill, i sat for 15 min and had to flag another waitress... DONT SIT THERE!!!

Hollz R.,"Olympia, WA",28,98,214,3.0,1/4/2016,"I like this red robin because its always less busy than the southcenter location. Plus it always appears pretty clean. The waitresses are always friendly and usually pretty quick with service -the new machines help with that cuz I can just push a button to call them to my table.  The burgers are good, if you go to red robin you know what to expect. And if they make a mistake they will gladly fix it.  I get Endless fries, with campfire sauce and a ranch every time. I do have to mention the horrible chocolate cake I had recently though. It was so gross I took one bite and spit it out and left the rest. The cake was dry and had to have been freezer burnt or something cuz it was just hard and lacked flavor. Really gross. And the waitress didn't ask if there was anything wrong or offer me a refund for it - I just paid for it and left it at that. Lol but I'll never order one there again and will always tell my friends how gross it was. I will go to red robin or fat burger if I want a decent burger for the 10$ price",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-des-moines?start=20

They have very friendly staff, pleasant atmosphere, and well prepared food.  The few times we had an issue with something being made incorrectly, they quickly fixed it. I love the ability to pay at my table and their loyalty program is great.  My only request would be that they have more vegan options and work on the quality of the Boca patties for their burgers.  They often come out dried around the edge (I suspect they are microwaved to avoid cross-contamination), but I'm glad they have them on the menu as a healthier alternative to beef.  I also like the lettuce wrap instead of a wheat bun when I'm avoiding gluten.  All in all, I leave Red Robin feeling satisfied and happy that I went.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-des-moines?start=40

The service has become absolutely terrible and I'm not sure if I will be returning after tonight.  Our waitress, Brittany, seemed to have a serious attitude problem. Right off the bat she was extremely rude. She constantly made faces as if she were annoyed although we did not ask for anything outrageous (unless you count substituting fries for macaroni and salad). She hardly came to our table and when she did she was very standoffish and also made a few snide remarks. When it came time to pay she seemed irritated that we had asked for separate checks, and I don't think one word was spoken to us after that. It was seriously awkward when she came to grab our cards and when she brought our receipts back.  Also, our cheese sticks didn't even have any cheese inside.

Our server was also very kind and helpful, she helped us with menu questions and checked up on our table appropriately. Not annoyingly buzzing around us or the opposite, hiding in the kitchen or back like some employees actually do. Water was refilled :) Our food was good. Fries were HOT and fresh. Burgers were good, too. The size of the burgers are plenty enough to get one full and with endless fries- pretty good deal for your $. We were offered more fries before we had the chance to request, cool. One thing I may note is that I ordered a whole grain bun for my burger.

Stefanie H.,"Kent, WA",16,147,12,1.0,7/26/2016,"Whenever a restaurant or food serving place gives me undercooked food or food that should not be served that has made me extremely sick, i don't give them a second chance. I came in on June 1st 2016 after moving to the area the exact day. I had a group of friends help me move my stuff and we came down here to grab dinner and relax. Relax i say? Yeah i tried doing that but i was sick for 3 days in a row & that was NOT MY IDEA OF RELAXING!  This location has a bunch of young girls working here but they were all pleasant with us. Because they don't actually ""Take your order"" you instead just order from the table tablet (Wee technology), so you really have little interaction with them except for the food being served. The wait time was somewhat long and i made a mental note that the location seemed dark and dull. Not as lively as i remember red robins to be. So when we finally got our food, I don't remember the sandwich i got but i do know it came with avocados and we did have some fries but that was all i ate. The food tasted great but half way eating it i did notice i wasn't feeling well so i took the rest of my sandwich to go. Afterwords all i could do was take pepto bismol and lay down for hours upon hours. Then the next day i had pains in my stomach and threw up on the 3rd day. At first i didn't think too much of my Red Robins meal because i was still in the process of unpacking but by the 3rd day i understood what it was.  So i am never going to this location again & if i had seen all the one stars on yelp before i went down here, i would of avoided this place like the plague. Please take my warning & stay away. The one in Federal Way or Kent is probably a ton better with hopefully no table tablet devices.

After ordering our food we were never asked if we wanted a different beverage then water(we did) also once our food was dropped off we were left stranded. No one came to give us napkins. I had to ask a different server in the area for napkins. Our waters were never filled. I also asked multiple servers if they could grab us some sauce for our fries. They then delivered the sauce once we were done eating. I understand they said something about a shift change. But our original bartender never said he was clocking out and the new bartender on shift never completed our service. The new bartender was yelling over the bar and had servers behind the bar. Then came back up to us and said ""was I grabbing you something?"" Yes 15 minutes ago you were but we would like the check now thank you. We won't be stopping here anymore.

Tony R.,"Seattle, WA",89,7,,2.0,2/3/2016,"I used to enjoy Red Robin but they have really declined in quality the last several years.  I try to not go there anymore but every once in awhile I'll get invited to go along with a group of people and I agree to go to give them yet another chance.  Each time I leave disappointed.  My last visit recently with some friends was no different.  In general, the food is just okay.  The prices are too high for what you get.  The service is average.   My last visit was a mess.  It was so bad that the management, server, and another staff member came over to our group to apologize in advance.  I just laughed to myself and knew we were in for an interesting meal.  The onion ring appetizers never showed up (they brought them out last, they were burnt, and then they gave them to us for free).  My friend's pre-meal salad never showed up (RR then boxed him up a salad to-go after he asked where it was).  The staff was fighting in the back.  It was bad enough that people could hear what was going on.  Our waitress admitted to having cried in the back office during that night.  It was just a crazy night there I guess.  I also wonder how we would have been treated if my one friend wasn't a well-known regular there.  I don't think we would have been given similar treatment, in my opinion. They did try to make good with free desserts for us and I ended up leaving a nice tip for the waitress as she tried really hard to make sure we had as good of an experience as we could.  I'll return to my usual routine of avoiding trips to Red Robin if I can.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-des-moines?start=40

Another time I went in and wanted a window seat but was told that was not possible by the lady who welcomes people at the front, I guess it's too hard for the waitress to go up two or three stairs if it isn't in her section.

Matt W.,"Seattle, WA",1,81,5,1.0,2/20/2016,"Let me start with a couple things. One, I know it's Friday and they are busy. Two, our kids love this place. We live 5 minutes away-they see a lot of their classmates there and they like the rr menu. Three I was starving. Seating was fast, almost too fast. Drinks were quick. Then comes food. Ordered onion rings on the computer, they came out quick and were good. Then it starts. It took a little while to come take our order-understandable, they are busy. Then it goes sideways. 45 minutes for food is a long long time.  My fish was so over cooked, the batter actually cut the roof of my mouth. I had a half a cup of tartar sauce, not enough for all the fish, so I left over cooked fish uneaten. My salad was withered, scraps, nothing I would serve, nothing I would eat, but I couldn't eat it anyway.  My daughter had the corn dog bites. They were as dark brown as they could get without being black. I asked for ranch for her, she said she would bring it back. I gave my daughter my ranch from my salad, she never came back. (Why I couldn't eat my salad) My wife's burger bun was almost too crunchy to eat.  The waitress never ever came back to our table. Ever.  If I had to guess our good sat under the lights by the horrible waitress a long time, only a guess. Those darn computers allow them to not have to cone back to get your money. Well guess what, they won't get anymore of mine. We have had less than good experiences there before, but nothing like this. They are understaffed with unqualified employees and management that must be oblivious. It's deteriorated over time, we used to go every week. I noticed last night it's been two months.

Liz C.,"Santa Clara, CA",435,507,2328,3.0,12/19/2017,"Okay, it's Red Robin. You're not going to find Michelin star worthy food here and it probably won't blow your mind, but it's Red Robin. The food is decent (pretty good when you want something heavy) so don't expect the place to have 4.5 stars+ on Yelp. I sat at the bar during dinner time because it was pretty busy in the main dining room. Got the menu and then it took a pretty long time for the bartender to get back to us to take our menu. She was off on her own in the beginning and didn't return to the bar for a while. We weren't in a rush though, but it was longer than I would have wanted to order food. I always get the short stack of onion rings here ($5 appetizer menu). It comes with six onion rings and the campfire and ranch sauce for dipping. Out of all the locations, I think this place did not do a good job in making the onion rings. The fried batter was just falling off the ring, and it was falling apart completely. It was never like this at other locations. I enjoy the tavern menu here because the burgers are smaller than the regular burger menu. Because the fries are bottomless (aka unlimited), I don't need a huge burger to fill me up. In fact, the tavern leaves me feeling pretty full by the end of it. If you like the tavern, you can make them bigger for an additional charge. They come up with different style taverns, and I tried the taco one. It comes with guacamole, salsa, and tortilla strips inside. I didn't taste the strips (I wonder if they turned into mush from all the sauces inside?). The guacamole was good, but I wish there was more. The salsa wasn't very potent, just subtle. Fries came out crisp and I dipped mine in honey poppy (the good stuff!). The bartender came back toward the latter half of dinner and was very attentive from then on. She filled our water, asked us if we needed anything several times throughout our dinner and was available if we needed her.  Checking out is simple now that they use the little electronic pads at each table. You can split the bill easily as well and then head on out as soon as your done! No more flagging down a waiter and waiting for your check, hurray! Overall, food was pretty good and service was decent. I still come back for the endless fries time after time.

Service is good here although sometimes slow when they get busy but that's expected. I watched a waitress deal with a problem customer very professionally one of the last times I was there.

Hint 2:  as soon as you get your burger with endless fries, order more fries as they come out very quickly and are very hot.  Better than the ones that come with your burger..  But do not wait until you our of fries to order, you will want more and they are supper good hot.

We visit this Red Robin probably about once a month because our daughter frequently has swim meets in the area.  The reason for the 2-star rating is the service. It is consistently bad. Even though the servers are friendly, orders usually come out incorrectly or it takes forever, even when the place is empty. I hate hate hate when people don't write down orders because they almost always screw it up. For example, hubs asked for no guacamole and add avocado on the side -- he received burger with guac AND avocados on it, kiddo asked for cheese on her burger and it didn't happen, plus no side of ranch for me.

Smaly K.,"Tacoma, WA",110,421,1554,2.0,3/13/2016,"Did not have a wonderful dining experience here.  We were going to get some Chinese food for dinner, but at the last minute, decided that burgers sounded good.  So we came here, ready to eat some burgers and bottomless fries.  Our waitress was friendly and brought us menus.  It seemed to take a little longer than usual for her to come take our order.  But that was okay, it gave me extra time to go over the menu, which I always like to do. After ordering it took about 40 minutes, if not longer, to get our food.  I was starving by then.  I finished my burger, fries, and water in less than 10 minutes.  We wanted more water, and refills on our fries and sweet potato fries, but out waitress had disappeared after taking our dinner order.  We were finally able to stop another waitress and ask if she can put in an order of sweet potato fries for us. Another long wait, at least 10 minutes, and no fries.  Another waitress came along and asked if we wanted more fries.  We told her we had put in an order already.  She came back with regular fries, and we asked if the sweet potato fries were coming, which we had ordered.  She said there were no sweet potato fries out, which I'm sure the other waitress had never put in the order for us. So we finally got our refills of the regular fries and sweet potato fries, but by this time, I'm highly irritated because we spent so much time here waiting.  And one of my pet peeves:  no refills on the water.  I hate eating with no water. Our actual waitress still had not come around since taking our order, and we were definitely ready for the check.  I couldn't even pay using the electronic pad sitting on the table because it had other people's orders mixed with mine.  Took some time again to find another waitress to give us our check.  I really really regret not getting Chinese food like we had originally intended.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-des-moines

Wet, nasty, dirty, sticky tables no matter which direction you looked.  It also appeared that a shift change may have been going on as we had more than one server. No one was rude, but the place was filthy and the service was inexcusable slow based on the fact that there appeared to be an employee for every table in use.

We waited a very long time for our food.  The good news is that others who had been seated about the same time also didn't have food.  The excuse for the late food was that the kitchen was slow!!!!  When our food finally arrived it was cold.  My chicken was rubbery!  At the end of our meal we were served a sunday with two spoons for the three of us in appreciation of our long wait.  I told the waiter that I'd rather have a discount.  He said that he couldn't give me a discount because all of the other diners would want a discount.  Well, they all deserved a discount.  We won't be going back soon, if at all.  There are too many good places to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-des-moines?start=100

Thomas S.,"Des Moines, WA",67,31,7,1.0,11/18/2015,"It's got to be really bad if I'd rather write this review than eat the food. This visit 11/17/2015 negates our 3 previous 4-5 star visits. It was that bad. It's not that it was unusually busy for a Tuesday night. That was taken into consideration during our long waits. So, this place is newly remodeled. That part is good. The service was terrible. And I mean terrible. One of the top 10 worst experiences ever. So, our server comes to our table relatively quickly. I order a coffee, my wife a white wine. Server comes back a few minutes later and informs that a fresh pot needs to be brewed, no problem there. Several minutes later, she returns with my coffee and the wine. Takes our order, and is gone. 30-40 minutes gone. Empty coffee cup, empty wine glass. No server in sight. So, 45 minutes post order, I use the handy-dandy call server button on the automated table doo-hicky. Flashing red beacon blinking. This might get us a refill, right, WRONG!!! Several servers and staff walked right by us. Finally 10 minutes after pushing the button, our server carries some drinks past our table, clearly looks at the light. So, we figure she'll serve the table she is headed to and check back with us... WRONG AGAIN!!! She checks the table next to us and bails. I push the blinking red beacon to the edge of the table with our empty cups. Several minutes still. And finally. But, my wife now wanted coffee instead of the stale tasting wine she had before. The server seemed annoyed at this. Fancy that, SHE was annoyed. She the says ""I'll go check on your food, I wonder what's taking so long"". Yeah, I wonder. So, here it comes. I wish I could post the picture to this review but, you'll have to see it up there. I substituted sweet potato fries. And, that's what I got. A tiny handful of old, dry sweet potato fries. At this point I am ready to walk out. After sitting for an hour, that's what I get. I really no longer had an appetite. I pushed my untouched plate to the side. The server apparently noticed a few minutes later and asked if everything was OK. A few minutes later a fresh basket of fries was brought to me. But, apparently what was taking so long was our food sitting, getting cold. Mine was a borderline acceptable temperature but, my wife's burger was cold. She waited to tell me until after we left, knowing, I was on the edge of talking to the manager. I was irritated enough to want to walk out before the food came. After the fries, I really didn't feel this place deserved my money. One simple note to the manager. If you have staff unaccustomed to working on a busy night, actually train a TEAM. The fact that all of your servers have tunnel-vision and will not at least give a ""thank you for waiting, I'll get your server"" gives you as a manager a big FAIL. So really, this is your failure. The waits, and food mishaps could have been heavily softened by some kind attentiveness by the staff. This is basic customer service. It does not take a rocket scientist to figure that out.

We were very clear with the server as to what we expected in our order. However, from the appetizers to the main course our order was filled with negligence. Finally, when we were able to speak with the manger, Sam Walton, he feigned interest in our concerns and questioned our experience by expressing he had to view security footage to corroborate our story. Rather than taking any efforts to make the customer feel at ease, he continued to escalate the situation. Then we waited another 20 minutes with no response from Mr. Walton, finally another manager helped ease our exiting transactions.

The prices are on average $3 more than fast food and the ingredients taste like they could be used for fast food. The burgers need the red robin special salt to make them enjoyable. There are probably 100 better burger places within a 15 minute drive of this place.  The service is and always will be slower than acceptable. For whatever reason when this place is empty it takes longer to get your food than when its packed. If you call in an order for pick up and they say 10 minutes that really means 20 if not 30.

Firebreathing D.,"Kent, WA",0,6,,1.0,12/16/2015,"So I went in earlier with my kids and was seated somewhat near the kitchen, the wait staff was nice however I didn't even bother ordering any of us drinks. Within ten minutes of being seated all we hear is someone in the back (female) screaming at their staff. Way to go, no wonder no one wants to come here. All I heard was screaming about this and that to I'm fairly sure the kitchen staff nonstop. Had it been just loud talking it would've been one thing but full on shrill screaming like someone was losing her mind. I'd be amazed if no one quit. That is seriously no way to manage your staff no matter how bad/new they are. These people working here are not your children whoever that was needs to stop talking down to her people. I cannot spend money at a place that treats their people that horribly. The waitress apologized about this after I explained what I was hearing and was especially embarrassed customers could hear this woman in the back. If you guys want to know why there's so many new people in and out of that place I'm betting that's why right there. Restaurants need a good team and you can't form one doing that.

Heather P.,"Seattle, WA",1,12,,3.0,1/12/2015,"Red Robin has been a favorite restaurant of mine for many years.  The Des Moines location is the closest to me, though I much prefer the atmosphere of the Tukwila restaurant.  Every time I go, there always seems to be a larger than average number of children and it is quite crowded.  Some of the neon signs at the bar are absolutely blinding, and the TVs are not strategically placed so I found myself craning my neck to view them.  That said, the food is usually quite tasty and the wait staff are great.  Last time I went, my date was prepared the wrong burger (I believe the waiter wrote it down wrong) and he had to wait another 10-15 minutes for the correct one.  Much to my surprise, there was no discount on the bill to reflect the error.  I wish I liked this place better, but the atmosphere is quite poor.  There are no divider walls and the tables are close together.  It makes you feel like you are sitting next to all the other people in the room.  I much prefer other Red Robin locations for this reason alone, but this may be less important to other patrons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-des-moines?start=120

We were all in our Army Uniform. It was kinda akward being out in uniform, but we were hungry. And one of the guys was on crutches. So everybody was staring. Not because we were in uniform, but because there was a guy in an Army uniform on crutches and we all looked tired and dirty like we just got done with a mission. We didn't. Just training. Our waitress was nice, but it seem like she didn't want to be there. She didn't smile much. It made the experience less memorable. But it's ok.  I had the Whiskey River BBQ Burger. It was good. I didn't mind it too much. I can't really say much about the food. It wasn't an excellent burger and it wasn't a bad burger. It was a Red Robin burger is the best I can describe it.

Katlynn H.,"Des Moines, WA",0,9,,1.0,12/15/2013,I love red robin in general but I absolutely detest this red robin location. let me tell you why: so my grandmother and I decide to eat here one Saturday afternoon and she and I both ordered our burgers and each of us took a couple of bites just too discover that both of our burgers were burned charcoal black! We asked the waiter if we could get a refund and if the cook can remake our burgers. So he comes back and offers half off our order but they wouldn't remake the burger! Are you kidding me???!!! You expect us to eat an inedible cheeseburger! So we asked to speak with the manager and he said the same thing but this time didn't charge us for the meal but charged us for our drinks and still wouldn't remake our burgers! We just walked right out and I later called corporate and complained and they sent me a $25 gift card. I will use that gift card at perhaps the tukwila or at the Bellevue location. Never again will I dine at this particular Red Robin location! You should only dine here if you enjoy eating burnt burgers and not getting another burger after you were served an inedible one!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-des-moines?start=140
Kiki M.,"Seattle, WA",145,449,6,3.0,1/20/2009,"I remember being in high school and going to Red Robin all the time thinking this was what a great burger and fries tastes like. Thankfully I matured and realized Red Robin has ridiculously sub-par food but where else can you get huge burgers, bottomless french fries, an atmosphere that's supposed to get you happy and excited, and a bird mascot that scares the shit out of little kids? Today, after not being in one of these eateries for a while, I decided to grab some lunch before a doctor's appointment. I walk in and sit in a booth at the bar. The bartender didn't notice me. After about 5 minutes I get noticed and she brings over the huge menu and apologizes for the wait. I take the enormous menu from her and look at my options. Meat, meat, meat. Damn, it was much easier to eat here when I consumed cow.  The waitress came back and I asked if it was possible to get a gourmet  burger and substitute the meat patty with a gardenburger. Sure! Awesome! I get the mushroom swiss burger with a gardenburger. Shortly after it arrives and its piled high with mushrooms. I sink my teeth in and it was...uneventful. The gardenburger was hard in spots and the mushrooms weren't all that soft. No problemo. This damn burger was almost $10 so its getting eaten. I took advantage of the bottomless french fries and got another fill.  For my burger and my Bud Light it came to $14. 54. Yikes. Was this place always this pricey? If only my memory of a stoner would let me remember.  If you've been to one Red Robin you've been to them all. Take your kids so they can get a free balloon, have indifferent waiters and waitresses sing a song for their birthday, or so they can cringe in fear at the mascot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-des-moines?start=140
