Ted H.,"Louisville, KY",0,11,4,5.0,1/3/2018,"It was around 1 p.m. on a very cold and snowy day.  As a result, the crowd was light.  I was greeted quickly and seated at a table near the bar, which turned out to be a great thing because Debra was my server, who was working behind the bar.  If there was a picture in the dictionary next to the word  ""server,"" she would be there!  She quickly took my drink order while I looked over the menu.  I ordered the veggie burger with ""bottomless"" fries.  The burger was very good.  Lots of fixin's on the burger, avacado, lettuce, tomato, special sauce.  Delicious!  The fries were crispy and I was so full I couldn't eat the ones on my plate, so no bottomless fries for me today.  Debra anticipated everything so that I never had to ask for a thing.  When my Coke was half full, she was there with another one.  She checked back with me frequently to make sure all was fine. My experience was what everyone hopes for at Red Robin, good food, great service.  I'll be back.  Thanks Debra!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit
Lucy C.,"Ashland, OR",0,19,5,3.0,12/19/2017,The burgers here were okay I had a bacon cheeseburger the fries weren't as fresh as I expected the service was nice though not too many people we were seated in a cozy little section not too many people in our business. I recommend the strawberry lemonade it's always phenomenal !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit
Erin B.,"North Charleston, SC",6,27,26,4.0,9/25/2017,"This is my family's spot to go when celebrating one of the kid's birthdays. Yesterday we were here with a party of 9. The wait seemed a bit long, but the service made up for it. Patrick was our server and he did an awesome job. Even my mom commented on his attentiveness on our drive home. Patrick took care of all of us in a friendly & bubbly way. He knew what we needed before we asked for it and made sure our dining experience was a good one. The birthday girl lost her balloons which floated to the ceiling and Patrick was right there to assist by using a chair to get them down. Thanks Patrick! Keep drinking those coffees!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit
Angela S.,"Westland, MI",77,119,386,4.0,6/18/2016,"More than just great burgers here...  Whenever I visit Red Robin, the host staff always greets me and seats me right away with a smile. The service is pretty standard; friendly but sometimes a little slow for my liking.  The food is good with a nice selection of specialty burgers with clever topping choices. You can substitute a chicken patty or veggie burger if you so desire. Nice apps and desserts, a full bar menu, dessert options and shakes; even a beer shake! The signature blend seasoning on every table adds a extra touch. We went for non-burger selections with the fish and chips and Ensenada chicken platter. The bottomless sides (we chose garlic parm fries and steamed broccoli) are a nice plus.  The atmosphere is buzzing with voices and laughter. It's a great place for kids with brightly colored decor, fun art and a small arcade.  Fun choice for a Saturday night...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit
Reginald T.,"Detroit, MI",5,15,4,5.0,3/18/2017,"This is the kind of place you want to meet up with some friends so you can have a good burger, drink of beer and enjoy the ambiance.

Carl W.,"Detroit, MI",84,2,,4.0,12/22/2016,"Well it's been a while since I've been been here, but last time I was here, I met a server named Dwight, this guy is very attentive to your requests and he doesn't even write anything down, and yet brings it back just as you ordered it.  I give big points for that. I'll always look for him when I visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit
Francis F.,"Chicago, IL",163,417,4444,3.0,5/30/2015,I dont know if it ws just the fact its friday night but I didnt like the terrible wait time 45 mins for getting and serving our drink orders and 30-45 for the food. I definitely felt they could have done a better job preparing the tables to accomodate party of 13adults and 10kids..I have to say though I really enjoyed my turbo q tavern double burger with bacon!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit
Scott M.,"Canton, MI",122,190,41,4.0,2/18/2015,"I went here for a Quidditch Team outing. Everyone left happy. The food was good. I had the Patty Melt. I devoured that whole thing in 6 bites because it was so yummy and delicious. They always made sure everyone had fries, all the time.  The service was awesome. We had 20 people come in at 8 p.m. and they were kind, caring, and gracious. The food came out so fast for everyone too. The management here runs a damn good ship. Keep up the great work. Also - Red Robin's Fish and Chips, very under-rated. Their Tarter sauce is soooo good. I think next time I roll here, I'm getting the burger with the egg on it. It looked so good and everyone who ordered it, destroyed all of it. Must have been good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit

LaToya E.,"Atlanta, GA",1,43,3,2.0,7/25/2016,"Not good at accommodating a large party. Took 45 minutes to get our drinks an 1.5hours to get food. Hard pressed to get refills, napkins, and condiments.

Erik B.,"Dearborn, MI",0,1,,2.0,3/4/2015,"I love a good burger, like any American. Service was horrible.  Only thing that was done right was being greeted at the door. Took 15 minutes before a waitress came over to take our drink order, and the only reason she did was because we got up and asked for a server. I ordered a gourmet (not) burger. Wife ordered fish. The bun on the burger was old and stale and the food itself was warm, not hot. My wife's fish wasn't cooked thoroughly. Waitress said I will have them take it off the bill...after we had been there for almost 45 minutes. I could understand if the place was busy, but it wasn't. As far as I am concerned, her drink and soup should have been comp'd as well.  This restaurant needs to hire some competent staff and train them. They make the chain look horrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit
Jax J.,"Detroit, MI",0,10,,3.0,11/20/2015,"Service is Ight, took about 20 min to get our food.... Waitress wasn't alllll that, but burger was on point so I ain't even mad",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit
Suni S.,"Chicago, IL",30,25,36,1.0,5/16/2015,The service is terrible.The food timing was the worst some in my party were finished before I got my food. Refills were problematic also.

Tina B.,"Almont, MI",0,26,,5.0,7/26/2015,"I love Red Robin, wish they had free wi fi like every other restaurant.   I got the barbeque burger, my husband got the tavern double and my son got the new nacho burger.  All the burgers were good, cooked exactly how we wanted them and very fresh.  They have very good french fries and a variety of dipping sauces, we got the sweet and spicy ketchup and ranch dressing, both were good",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit
Steve M.,"Studio City, CA",7,67,,4.0,11/19/2014,"It was snowing, I was cold, and the choice of food at my hotel wasn't the greatest. What to do? I'm sniffy about chain restaurants, but this place knocked it out of the park. Ghost chili and jalapeno burger, fries and a couple of beers, plus the bartender and my server, Traci, was a gem. Thanks! Fed, happy and back to LA sunshine tomorrow!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit
Christina L.,"Royal Oak, MI",31,10,2,5.0,3/24/2013,"Alright, the only reason I'm putting a five star rating is because of Deborah, the bartender. Otherwise, my experiences as a guest isn't always the greatest at this location. Every time I've come in, to place a to-go order, I've had her to greet me. She is extremely professionals and kind. She always makes sure my to-go order is correct by showing me what I've ordered and letting me know the condiments she placed in the bag as well. She is just a sweet woman. I work in the restaurant industry as well, and she treats me the way I treat my guests, ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen.

Elisha C.,"Detroit, MI",62,28,,5.0,4/23/2015,"Just had my sons birthday dinner for his first birthday. Our waitress was so kind and the server team even sing happy birthday. The Royal Red Robin burger is my favorite. My son enjoyed his Mac and cheese and the onion tower is by far one of the coolest appetizers out there, really good as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit
Christina D.,"Farmington, MI",33,19,65,4.0,12/5/2013,"So this red robin is nothing special. As the other servers are probably not making money it's understandable. They all have resting bitch face. As a person in the restaurant industry this location is a little off upon first sight. But, once you get past the ever so Obvious resting bitch face. You can start to enjoy your server I had Breeanna she was young and kind of goofy but it worked. This location has the worst rep but it's understandable the servers seem to be good but if no one is walking they are only making 2.65 which would make me a lil annoyed. I got the BBQ whiskey chicken wrap it was delicious. Just give this location a chance it isn't bad at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit
Craig M.,"Detroit, MI",0,6,,1.0,3/26/2016,"I ordered carryout when this location first opened. The staff was extremely rude and my order was incomplete. Instead of correcting it, they went on to tell me I was wrong. So, last night I decided after years of being open, they might have improved. This was not the case. I ordered carryout, again. My fiance ordered a burger medium well. There was blood on her buns and in the carryout case. The egg on her burger was burnt. My fish, shrimp, and clams were soggy even though I was there to pick up my order 5 minutes before being told to. Our desert was an absolute joke. We got the donuts and they literally put them in a used box that had French fries and salt in the bottom. Again, the staff was rude, uninviting, and just downright depressing. I will not ever be coming back and I'll be letting everyone I know to pass up on this garbage establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit
Adam H.,"Detroit, MI",1,6,9,2.0,12/17/2014,Me and my ol lady went to red robin one night when we first walk in we were greeted at the door & shown to our seats right away after that the night just got worse our drinks were watered down they took for ever to take our order and even longer to make it my clam strips were extremely salty my burger was under cooked my ol lady Fish and chips was rubbery and very wet for some reason the waitress act like she had an attitude and was gone for a long time then when she came back and asked how is everything? she seemed like she was high and smelled of marijuana no wonder we got such poor service and food. seems to me the only good service you get at Red Robin is when you first walk in the door and are about to leave everyone standing near the door like they have nothing else better to do happy to greet you coming in and going out,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit?start=20
Harold W.,"Grand Haven, MI",5,91,78,4.0,1/4/2015,We love Red Robin.  They have great burgers and family fun atmosphere.  Join their club on line and get free burger for your birthday.  I love the bonzai burger and they have other good sandwiches.  Campfire sauce is really good with the endless season fries.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit?start=20
Jayla A.,"Sandusky, OH",0,7,,2.0,5/9/2014,We went to this red robin to have a night out to eat. We walked in and we were greeted. Once we were seated. It took 15 min for the waitress to come over. We asked a few questions about the menu that she did not know the answer to so a coworker came to answer them. My friend ordered a drink which she never got but was charged for. Our buns were burnt and service was extremely slow. The waiter had an attitude with us. I think ill be going to the other red robin restaurants.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit?start=20
Emine S.,"Detroit, MI",173,104,17,3.0,6/6/2013,"My husband is obsessed with their chili burger. He is from Toronto, so whenever he is in town I can almost guarantee that we'll be going to Red Robin. This item isn't on the menu, but they'll still make it for you.

Andrea J.,"Kalamazoo, MI",3,46,,2.0,6/29/2014,"good food, awful service.  I haven't been to a Red Robin in ages, but i have happy memories of them from when I was a teenager. I had a hankering for a burger, fries, and beer, so Red Robin seemed like a good idea.   Not this one.  Took a while for a hostess to greet me (this after a handful of employees walked right past me and studiously did not make eye contact), I was seated a booth with dirty seats in the bar, and was told the bartender would be helping me. Bar seating was just fine for me, btw.  There were a few other tables in the, and maybe two people sitting at the bar.  The bartender was expected to service these parties, mix all the cocktails for the entire restaurant, and process to-go orders.  There were two other waitresses hanging out in the bar area, but they didn't help him one bit, nor did they make eye contact with any customers in the area.  When the bartender did take my order and bring my food he was friendly, but getting his attention later was nearly impossible.  I might be judging the slow service a little harshly because i was very hungry..... but there were not that many customers in the restaurants and a ton of staff wandering around doing nothing.    Next time I want a build-my-own-burger there's a good chance I'll have my eye out for a Red Robin.  Just not this one. Not ever this one, not ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit?start=20
Chrissie N.,"Southgate, MI",15,40,,4.0,4/10/2013,"It's been a while since we've gone here but the food was delicious and our server was wonderful.  A little pricey, but what restaurant isn't nowadays?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit?start=20
Katie W.,"Detroit, MI",67,125,95,4.0,10/14/2009,"It's not often that I step into a Red Robin, but on this particular day I was meeting someone for lunch, and this was her pick. I am basing my review solely on my experience for lunch here. After reading some of the reviews, it looks like our server: Jafar, made all the difference in the world.   They sat us at a booth in the partition of the restaurant with windows. Not quite a sun-room, but whatever. Quikly brought me a high chair, and then we ordered drinks. I just got the very berry raspberry limeade.  I wanted the turkey club but I'm not a fan of it being stacked on toast, so I ordered it as a wrap- fresh spinach wrap sounded delicious. No problems substituting! I ordered the chicken and cheese quesadillas for my little one with apple slices. No issues with the food once it was brought out to us, and when Jafar heard my lil guy asking for more ""apples"" he brought us out some more- super nice, and it kept the lil one happy = ) He brought him a green balloon too, which he just relished in the fact that he finally had a balloon to jump around with, bop around, try to squeeze and bite, and watch it floating around while tied to his wrist. Ahh, free entertainment! So as you probably won't see me in here again, we had a good dining experience without any hang-ups.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit?start=20
Mary R.,"Warrendale, Detroit, MI",0,1,,1.0,1/19/2014,"The food at any red robin is delicious, usually...here is soup would be considered water and the service was horrible!!!  I would never come come to THIS red robin again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit?start=20
Frank N.,"Detroit, MI",35,49,15,3.0,1/6/2009,"Hmm....  I read Melody B's review and had to chime in.  I live just a few blocks away so I've been there several times.

Melody B.,"Hamtramck, MI",69,66,,1.0,10/20/2008,"This is not the Red Robin you want to go to. I've been to others and have had a 3-, 4- even 5-star experience before. This location is terrible. The host was extremely polite and had a great personality. That's about the only positive thing I can say.  The drinks came slow and were expensive. The appetizer was forgotten about, even though the server suggested it to us. Soup was asked to be brought before the meal and was brought with the meal. When the food finally arrived, it was cold.  The server was semi-attentive. The two bartenders were extremely rude to our server when he asked for our drinks. They did not tell him they were ready and acted like it was his fault. We didn't care, we just wanted them. Overall most of the staff was rude or overly aloof, with the exception of the host, who was a delight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit?start=20
Marshall W.,"Dearborn, MI",25,31,35,4.0,9/21/2010,"I'm writing about this place because I live(d) nearby and I have been here a few times over the years. I only go here for the burgers .. not the expensive drinks. Maybe I should make a couple disclaimers: I'm an ""el cheap-o"" (I usually only drink water and think any burger over $5.99 is expensive - but, maybe this is because I'm an old fuddy-duddy and can remember when prices were so much less - like, before the late 70's). I also own stock (not much) because I like the atmosphere and quality of food. I like it better than that stuffy Ruby Tuesday. I only go here every couple months because burgers are not the best for my diet - but, damn! they make a good one. I love the ""Five Alarm Burger"".  They are located in an old Big Boy Restaurant and they appeal to the kids, so it's great for the family. Of course, that means it's going to be rather noisy, but that's part of the fun. The wait staff gets flustered some times and waits are sometimes long.. but on quieter nites, service is just fine. Many of my kids friends are servers there. They support local efforts, too. A rather up-scale burger place with kid-friendly environment. They have some beer and mixed drinks, too - just waaayy too expensive for my tastes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit?start=20
Michael V.,"Longwood, FL",6,150,1,1.0,12/14/2012,"I travel all over the country and have eaten at many Red Robins. This was by far the worst one I have ever been in. I should have known when I walked in and noticed a $2 for 22 ounce draft beer happy hour, and there was no one at the bar. In fact, I could count on one hand how many customers were in the whole place. Most Red Robins are ALWAYS packed with people.  The service was friendly, which was the only thing this place has going for it. They were out of one of the draft beers I wanted. I ordered my burger pink throughout, and it came pink, however dry as sawdust. How does that even happen? I could understand if I ordered it well done. The fries were ice cold. Literally, they were so cold they were chewy. I waited and waited to try to get some fresh ones. Finally, I had to walk up and ask the hostess to help me. This was the first time I couldn't wait to get out of a Red Robin. I normally love this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit?start=20
CrazyforMakeup M.,"Northville, MI",5,36,,1.0,10/9/2009,"I love Red Robin... but my review is for this one in particular at Ford Road in Dearborn... I usually go to the one at 6Mile Rd in Livonia (not at Yelp) and over there is always awesome. Here however, is a dive... well, the host was okay, the waitress so so, but the food sucks. The Milkshakes, they are always on the runnier side not like thick semi frozen as I get in the other restaurant. And it is always VERY SLOW. The hamburguer is always a miss, the cook is just incompetent. If you ask for medium well, is still very pink inside ... then if you ask well done, it comes semi burned. So really, you just flip the coin and hope for the best.  From probably 12 times I've been there (yes I work nearby, so what can I do, if I want a hamburguer McD's?) maybe just once the food was done well. So the place is definetely not consistent. I would not recommend. Maybe in a year they will get better... I'm always checking them, but for now, one start is as good as it gets...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit?start=20
Nanette K.,"Allen Park, MI",0,22,17,1.0,8/31/2013,"Like others that have commented on this location I just want to say that other red robins are very good. But this one is not. It really does depend on the location. I usually go to the red Robin in Southgate, but happen to be in the area When we saw this Restaurant and we decided to try it. The hostess was on the phone when we walked in and didn't hang up for 30 seconds while we stood there. She was obviously on a personal call but did not seem to mind that she had customers. After she hung up she finally sat us and our waitress was very sweet. She was very new you could tell, but did not have anybody following her to train her. She was nice nonetheless so we gave her a chance. The food that came out was disgusting. My daughter ordered the French dip with au jus sauce. The bread was hard as a rock, the au jus was greasy, and the lettuce they put on the plate for garnish was completely dry and wilted. We let our waitress know and she offered to take the food off the bill, but did not offer anything else. The service was slow, the food was terrible, I would never go back. I'm going to post a picture of the food that we were served so you can see for yourself. The food was honestly terrible. Why pay that much money and waste your time when you're hungry for food that comes out looking like this. I'll stick to the Southgate location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit?start=20
