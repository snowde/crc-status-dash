TJ S.,"Manassas, VA",0,1,,2.0,12/23/2016,Today I placed a to-go order for a plain smoke & pepper cheese burger to be cooked rare and asked to have A1 Peppercorn sauce added to the burger. The burger was overcooked and didn't have the A1 Peppercorn sauce. It did came with about 20 french fries that were soggy and cold. I think for a place that offers bottomless fries they could put a few more in with the to-go orders. I asked for a side of macaroni and cheese which was also ice cold. The piece of cheese that's put on top wasn't even melted. The only reason I'm not giving 1 star is because the overcooked burger still had decent flavor for a burger well done. Needless to say this experience literally and figuratively left a bad taste in my mouth. I don't plan on visiting another Red Robin anytime soon if ever.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles?start=20
Mike R.,"Sterling, VA",93,235,431,2.0,2/13/2016,"For a $10 burger, they sure give you a small patty.  Taste was okay on the burger... but man, I swear I've had bigger patties at a fast food joint.   Fries were cold and floppy. But seriously, the smallest patty I can recall getting at a restaurant.  I'm not even sure it was a quarter pounder.  For $10 bucks... c'mon man!  You're supposed to be a burger joint, Red Robin.  How you going to skimp on the burger patty??? I don't go enough to know if I just ordered a small burger, but it was the ""original cheeseburger"" or whatever... the one that made them famous the menu said. Waitress was on top of things and friendly, so kudos to her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles?start=20
Mike B.,"Chicago, IL",3611,886,2008,2.0,2/3/2014,"Came in here not long ago and sat at the bar thinking it would make things go faster, this was not the case.  The two female bartenders appeared to be arguing the whole time we were there and we just watched them make bickering comments at each other the whole time.  If I were the manager I would have sent them both packing for acting that way in front of guests.   The food itself was OK when it finally came out.  The one bartender blamed the other one and we found out it had been sitting on the counter.   So if you decide to go here and get a decent burger, get a table so you do not get caught in between a cat fight at the bar!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles?start=20
Fred S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,126,3,4.0,12/20/2016,"Burgers a bit pricey. Service good. If you are an adult, they will seat you in the bar area on a high table with the drinkers. Try and catch a special when you go and join the rewards club.  Much better than BGR. About the same as Five Guys, but that place is always raising prices. Lots of burger competition in the area now.  I agree with another review of this location - needs Wi-Fi. Update: As of 6/29/17 - still no wifi. Apparently this franchisee refuses to install it (read: cheap). The Ashburn location has it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles?start=20
Tom C.,"South Riding, VA",78,3,,1.0,1/18/2016,Have to be honest.  Was seated with a table of 4. Took Bryan (our waiter) 5 mins to come to the table. He has some kind-of attitude when he took our orders. He needed to cut his hair too. Food was excellent however due to Bryan's lack of service and care I would not go back there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles?start=20
Christina R.,"Safety Harbor, Tampa Bay, FL",50,141,73,4.0,3/1/2016,"Good thing Yelp didn't ask me if they had milkshakes, because they don't. At least tonight they didn't. Besides that this place was extremely clean and the service was very attentive. My husband got the A1 Peppercorn he said it was ""okay, I just didn't like the sauce"". I got the Avo-Cobb salad. It was good, hit the spot. This was a much better visit than the last time we came. Wish I had that damn milk shake though.

Joann B.,"Fairfax, VA",162,428,133,4.0,10/28/2014,"My visit here was actually really pleasant.  We got an end booth in the bar area, it was a little awkward as the table kind of juts out into the walkway, but overall, a good experience.  Our server was attentive and refilled our drinks without asking and he wasn't obtrusive or overbearing.  We ordered the boneless chicken wings, fish and chips, and the BBQ burger.  The wings came on a bed of potato chips and was generously covered in Buffalo sauce.  The wings were crispy, tender, and spicy.   The fish and chips were also crispy and tender.  Surprisingly, they were not overly greasy and the fries weren't soggy.  The burger is very messy, but good.  If you're like me, you would need some BBQ sauce on the side to make the burger that much better. Overall, our experience at the local Red Robin was one of the best out of all the chains in the area.  This could just be dumb luck, and we showed up on a good night, but we've not had any problems with this chain anywhere else and the food was better than most.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles?start=20

Just screaming for the fun of it and the mom was not controlling her child. It was hurting my son's ears, and kept making him jump when he started dozing off. Then the server was AWEFUL. had to ask several times for her to refill our drinks.

I don't know if they can't read or just choose not to care just like the rest of the people that work here  Eating there is bad and ordering out is even worst  Guaranteed that if you don't check your order before leaving, when you get home you won't like it Unfortunately this is the closest to me ...

Whoever said it in their review was right, management doesn't even care.  Our service was ok, our food ok although I'm not sure what makes their $15 burger worth it, BUT our plates (all 3) were dirty.  My wifes was the worste and when she pointed it out the offer was a new plate, no mention of new food... just same food different plate.  Who knows, maybe something on the food we didn't order.  We asked for the manager to show him the cheddar cheese crusted on the plate... my wifes burger had bleu cheese... weird right?!  He offered a new plate but no apology.  He didn't seem to care, the fries had a burnt fry up in the middle totally taking away from the meal.  For $15 how about nice presentation and a clean plate.  No apology and no discount offered... when I received the check, no discount. .. so I asked for one... $3... so a $12 burger on a dirty plate and no one seemed really care.  Manager acted like we were bothering him.   Goodbye Red Robin!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles?start=20
Richard Z.,"Portland, OR",42,198,94,2.0,11/26/2014,"Wow, they've dropped in quality here. I doubt it has to do with the strange shift in decor, but the service has really collapsed. There are still a couple of wait staff here who know what they're doing, but unfortunately they're now the exceptions, not the rules. I was coming here about 1/week with my daughter, and every week it was some kind of messed up order, forgotten silverware, or just mistake after mistake. I'm about done with it.

Dixon L.,"Centreville, VA",41,6,,5.0,9/28/2015,"Went to the restaurant multiple times and you gotta love this place! Absolutely love their salad(Spicy Sombraro) and would come back anytime to eat it. I'm not a big fan of sweet stuff, but their milkshake is decent. Bottomless fries and chips is fantastic, especially with the Capfire sauce. Service is great, friendly host, and attending servers, and hardworking bussers.  I went to this place multiple times during different appearing hours, I've gotta clarify about some of those bad reviews to be fair to the restaurant. Service ONLY drops slightly during rush hours, which is totally understandable. I wouldn't go to a baseball game and complain there are too many people and too noisy, why should I go to a restaurant during its peak busiest time and start complaining??? Even though service may drop slightly during peak hours, but it is observable that EVERYONE put in their best effort to provide the best service to the customers.

I originally ordered the Putin Fries and fried cheese curds, but they were loaded with so much garlic, I had to send them back and order something totally different which finally came out piping hot.

Baby L.,"Ashburn, VA",30,67,46,2.0,8/18/2014,"I went here to pick up food without reading Yelp reviews and  in particular, reviews by my esteemed friends, whose wisdom I've come to appreciate over the last few years. My mistake! The Chicken Cesar wrap had too much dressing inside. The fries were fresh when we got them but turned stale really quick. They were not seasoned, not even salted, which is fine by me. I liked the fried Cod. I received 4 pieces that were fried well except for one piece that was a bit raw. The tarter sauce was delicious even though it was served at room temperature. That wasn't the worst though.   The worse aspect of all the food was the French onion soup! Not only did they forget packing the focaccia bread it comes with, but this bowl of Red Robbins French onion soup was the worst tasting French onion soup I ever had in my life! All it was was a nasty bowl of bland beef broth with added water. It had no flavor! It was disgusting! I thought they forgot the onions until I noticed they were sunken at the bottom. I had to stir the soup to see the onions. The 'cheese' was a small mass of bubble gum lost in the murky water of the broth. It was awful. The whole thing was extremely watery that it was splishing and splashing in the container the whole way home. After a couple spoons, I just poured it down the sink. I could've easily flushed it down the toilet, too, because it was basically just water.  I don't know how this place stays in business. In the least, it should be a fast food restaurant and not a sit-down establishment. I can't believe they actually have waiters serving this crap. All in all, the food I got was not worth $30!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles?start=20
Joshua D.,"Sterling, VA",150,655,71,1.0,6/14/2014,"Welcome to HELL. Red Robins alone are bad enough because they're hell holes filled with rednecks and screaming children and very meh food. But this one and the whole experience was just horrible. Before you ask why I went, well, it wasn't my choice. Was there with family who has kids. Of course, the kids always order cheese pizza so why the $%!@ we don't go to a pizza place instead of a subpar burger joint is beyond me. So what was especially horrendous about this RR? For starters, it's a special kind of deafening. Forget the wide open echo chamber of brats who sound like they're in the deepest levels of the underworld's torture chambers. The booth setup had us right with our backs to the bar, and the damn phone at the bar was ringing VERY loud the entire time, and no one would answer it. The server, he was very bad at his job and the most annoying person I've probably ever met to boot. He whined about not getting enough sleep. He tried out his standup comedy routine that wasn't funny at all. He asked awkward questions. And he screwed up orders, forgot things that people asked for, you name it. Guy really needs to try something else... like maybe the mental hospital. And then there's the food. RR is usually not great anyway. It touts itself as a burger joint but I can rarely bring myself to order them because they're so bad. Like little frozen patty pucks. (Seriously, there are several Five Guys' within a few miles, GO GET A REAL BURGER IF YOU WANT A BURGER, YO.) So then I'm led to try one of the non-burger items on the menu, which is probably asking too much of a burger joint but hey, THEY PUT THEM ON THE MENU. Blech. The food was bad, though. I didn't find one thing on the menu that I wanted. I used to order the nachos here as an entree, but they took those off the menu (much like they replaced the unlimited mediocre fry baskets with tiny little fry cones not too long ago). I settled on ""Clucks and Riblets."" The 'clucks' were OK -- your standard deep-fried breaded chicken strips you can get anywhere. The riblets, however, were disgusting. You know how baby back ribs look after you finish eating the meat off them? Break one bone in half with its tiny pieces of meat remnant left on it, and you have yourself one of RR's riblets. They were dry, hell, they didn't even bother putting the barbecue sauce drizzle on all of them, but the meat was tough, dry and required a microscope to locate. Everyone who got a burger had a cold burger. The patties were cooked through, but they must've been sitting out for a LONG time. Which makes sense, because it took a long time to get our food. Start to finish, dinner took almost two hours. Oh yeah, and that fruit salad. I'll post a pic of it. I just had to take one because it was so disgusting that no one at the table who got that as a side would even touch it. It looks like the apple slices might have been done in the same day, but the other fruits *definitely* came from a can filled with high fructose corn syrup. Just a big soupy, mushy, overly sweet mess. PUKE. RR is loud. It's annoying. The service sucks. The food sucks. It has an identity crisis somewhere between a kiddie cartoon episode and a boozy R-rated film. Where else can you watch Boomerang, play with a man in a giant bird mascot suit, eat a kids meal and get wasted? STAY AWAY. KICK AND SCREAM.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles?start=20
Abraham A.,"Sterling, VA",6,5,,2.0,8/6/2016,"My wife and I ate last night and ordered a couple of their signature plates.  The food had little to no taste.  The buns for both burgers literally broke apart in our first bite.   The Coke I ordered tasted like seltzer carbonated water, absolutely no taste.  The fries were not fully cooked and the table and all the condiments were sticky, I could not lay my arm on the table nor could I grab the ketchup because of the stickiness.

Annzie A.,"Fairfax, VA",36,94,459,1.0,1/6/2018,"I always loved Red Robin burgers. The only difference this time is.... instead of dining in I thought I would try the curbside pickup. I now realize this was a big mistake. Not once but twice. My first order was a well-done Original Red's Tavern Double, No Tomatoes, No Lettuce, Sautéed Onions, Sweet Potato Fries, No Salt on Fries x Extra Fries. The burger was fine, except there wasn't any sauteed onions, only raw onions. The fries had salt, and I didn't get extra fries or sauce. The second order was a Prime Chophouse Beef - No Pink, Steak Fries, No Salt, Crispy Fries, No Onion Bun, No Steak sauce, No RR Seasoning, on a Sesame Seed Bun, with Sautéed Onions, Classic Sauces (1000 Island) on the side. This time, the beef was burnt, again no sauteed onions, just raw onions. The fries weren't crispy, and I had one random onion ring, no extra sauce on the side.

Vito M.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,8,4,3.0,7/2/2017,"So I'm dating this new Women GLENDA (Puerto Rican and gorgeous) we met on myspace. I think we are the only people who still who use that site. She's about half my age and has 4 kids and grandchildren and I got stuck taking them to Red Robin on our 2nd date. Christ on the cross help me  I can't remember all their names, as a matter of fact I called them all Charlie. So here I am trying to get the vibe going with GLENDA and these damn  kids keep screaming they're Hungary. I says to GLENDA where these kids from Somalia? So I figure I won't have to spend too much money making them order from the kid's menu. Well her Son in high school refuses to order from the kids menu and the damn Waiter doesn't seem keen on letting CHARLIE order from the Kid's menu. I tells the kid you're not 18 so you gotta order from the kid menu! I admit the kid has a beard but he aint 18 so he aint an adult.  Glenda whispers in my ear let him order from the regular menu and I give you dessert when we get back to my crib. So I say "" Okay Kid order from the Adult menu"", the damn plate was like 13 or 14 bucks and it came with those horrible steak fries. And they aint too generous with their lousy steak fries.  I asked the Waiter if they can get me real fries not steak fries since I aint eating a steak? He suggests ""Onion Rings"". So I think well ok that'll do but I don't want GLENDA to order any because I'm not going to kiss a dame with Onion breath.  So I goes to the John and do what a man has to do when the Taco Bell lunch didn't agree with him earlier.  So I comes out and Glenda and the kids, the grand kids are eating my pyramid of Onion Rings!!!!!!! Damn Greedy Bastards!  I get so mad, I says I'm gonna go in the car and get my phone.

Literally every food item was bottom of the barrel slop. Honestly I'm embarrassed to have even eaten here (and I gave a taco bell five stars!).

Our waitress made sure to keep them coming, as my boys and I kept filling the hole.  Both my boys ordered a milkshake for dessert and I can tell you by how fast it went down they were delicious.

Matthew F.,"Sterling, VA",6,3,,1.0,12/20/2016,"This Red Robin location is just terrible, there is simply no other way to rate my experience there on 12/19.  I would give it zero stars if possible.   I have been to other Red Robin locations around the country and have always enjoyed the food and service.  Big juicy burgers, and prompt friendly waitstaff.  This location was anything but that.   We walked in around 830 in the evening and took a seat in the bar area, which had 2-3 other tables occupied, other than that the restaurant was pretty empty.  I ordered a beer and my girlfriend ordered a Citron and water.  At the same time we ordered chips and guacamole.  The first thing that struck me as odd, was the bartender/server telling us that ordering a vodka/water was wierd.  I tended bar and waited tables to put myself through college and this is a pretty common order,  but okay, maybe he was new, whatever.  I told him him it was a pretty common cocktail, and he looked like he took offense, even though I said it really casually just to make conversation.  Anyways, he gets our drinks and comes back a few minutes later to take our entree order.  We both ordered the exact same burger (Blue Ribbon) except one had a salad substituted for fries.  The server of course didn't write anything down, which is fine it was an easy order.  Also, he kept trying to get my girlfriend to order one of the ""specialty"" cocktails even though she clearly stated what she wanted.  She had to tell him no 3 times before he relented.  Seriously? We had been sitting there for awhile and we needed another round of drinks, we tried to get the attention of the server numerous times as he went to other tables in the bar, but no luck.  He never came back and asked us how drinks were, checked if appetizer had arrived,  or if we wanted another round.  He was basically hanging out in a booth on the other side of the restaurant the entire time.  There were no employees in the bar area, not one.   By this time we had been seated  for close to an hour, have only been served one drink, not asked if we would like another round, and our chips and guacamole appetizer never came out to the table. I finally went to the booth where all the employees were hanging out and asked for our server.  A minute later the server came over to our table with two crusty dried out burgers, and said ""Sorry, our broiler was turned off"".  The burgers were not made the way we ordered them, and one had no toppings on it at all. WTF?  On top of this he didn't ask if we wanted more drinks, and our glasses were clearly empty.  And he never questioned the absence of our appetizer.  I might add that in this amount of time, a table that came in after us, ordered and had eaten their ENTIRE meal.   At this point I just told him we didn't want the food or another round, we would just pay for our drinks.  A manager came over and tried to make it right, but it was pretty unprofessional, he just said sorry repeatedly and insisted we take the food home in take out containers even though we didn't want it.  I told him we didnt want the food and why, but he still brought boxes to the table.  The food just looked really unappealing (wilted lettuce in my GF salad, dried out crusty buns, cold fries), and wasn't prepared the way we wanted it.  Not only that, the manager looked and acted like he was high as a kite. This server/bartender was just 100% not interested in doing his job.  That's all there is to it.  He had 3 other tables to take care of, and could not manage to get a really simple order to the kitchen.  We would have had atleast 2-3 drinks apiece had we been asked.  Isn't that the point of a restaurant, to sell drinks and food?    Clearly, the server forgot to put our order in TWICE.  Clearly this restaurant is mismanaged.    So, long story short, we waited an hour for two drinks, two jacked up disgusting burgers, and a pretty unprofessional response to the situation from the manager on duty I don't know the server/bartender's name because he never told us, but he had glasses, had his a hair in a hipster ponytail, and had an attitude problem. If any managing partner reads these reviews, I would appreciate a response because my opinion of Red Robin was drastically changed in a one hour experience.  I have dined at Red Robin for years in different parts of the country, and always enjoyed it, but probably won't ever go back after this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles

In the midst of taking my order, the waitress stops to cheer her alma mater on (watching the tvs). I asked for extra fries since they are unlimited. I also asked for the Caesar dressing (for my wrap) on the side as well as a side of low fat ranch dressing. Got home and we had about 10 fries in each box (no extra). The Caesar dressing was on the sandwich and no ranch. Funny thing is while I was waiting, the bartender got a call and yelled out to a manager that there was a to go order that was screwed up.

Citizen P.,"Reston, VA",0,18,22,4.0,10/19/2016,"We have been fans of Red Robin for more than 20 years. When we lived in CA it was a favorite spot in the mall for my daughter and her friends. We went as a family and when we lived in MI, we went often. We now live in VA and still go to Red Robin. We've also been to locations in other states. I will confess and say that the bottomless fries is one of the main reasons we are dedicated to Red Robin. Of course we love the burgers and food, plus the free lemonade refills!   Our most recent visit was pleasant because our waiter, Andrew, was very attentive. He was friendly and helpful, but not intrusive and annoying. It was near closing time, but he was still enthusiastic and attentive. He made our dining experience pleasurable. I had my laptop and needed to submit something online before midnight. I must say that I am disappointed that Red Robin still does not have wi-fi. Maybe Red Robin's CEO is thinking that if they provided free wi-fi, bottomless fries, and free refills on lemonade, they would probably have to evict patrons. I'm sure I could sit there for hours. :-) I love the bill-paying machine they have on the table. This eliminates the need for a waiter to take your credit card out of your sight. I really prefer patronizing restaurants that allow you to pay at the table or pay at the register. Again, this decreases the chance of dishonest servers  stealing your credit card information. I wish other restaurants would adopt Red Robin's pay at the table system.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles

Sophie S.,"Sterling, VA",8,100,,1.0,3/18/2016,"Have some pride. I hate leaving no tip and in many places I have accepted minor problems and live with it. This experience was one disappointment after another. Not greeted at the bar for 5 minutes, our beers were flat. Got one from one keg and another from the new keg, but am convinced the second was just the pitcher of the dregs after a foam out. Onion rings took 20 minutes, and it was not busy at all. I ordered a cod fish sandwich (yes I should have ordered a burger but my husband wanted red Robin and it's Lent!) and they brought out fish and chips that were fried to a crisp. Seriously all breading burnt and inedible. Hubby ordered a burger and garlic fries, but got regular fries only.  Look in the end I am not an avid yelper and sometimes things happen. But the employees were congregating at the bar and in a booth nearby, there were dirty glasses all over the bar next to us, and while waiting for the check we couldn't find anyone to flag down.  This restaurant needs a manager that takes pride in customer service and understands that at red Robin, the food is not the draw. It's about making sure the mediocre food is presented with a smile and attentive service. In many cases we have found this to be the case. Tonight the service at the bar was a joke.

Sam M.,"Bristow, VA",6,13,4,1.0,12/20/2015,"Was here yesterday before Christmas shopping at the mall. We arrived early around 11:30am to a virtually empty dining area that had the AC blasting-it was about 40 degrees outside. Things started off promising as our tower of onion rings arrived piping hot and delicious. BUT from there, it went downhill quickly. The waiter kept referring to my grandson as ""the kid"" which I know doesn't seem offensive, but somehow it just came across that way. ""Let me repeat your order, blah, blah...and for the kid..."" Maybe it's just me.  After the drinks arrived, the onion rings were shortly after. My 3yr old grandson had inhaled his chocolate milk, so we ordered another for him. Our ice teas were nearing empty when it was delivered, but we were never asked for refills. After about 10 minutes we hailed someone down to ask for a refill and then our waiter brought over unsweetened tea. When they brought the food...an hour later... It was cold and my grandson got french fries instead of apples. We hailed the same guy over and it turns out he's the manager. He brought the apples and a replacement burger for me.  Finally, they have placed a little kiosk machine on the table to play a trivia game and my wife was exploring it but stopped when it wanted money to play. When reviewing the bill, I mentioned the ""entertainment"" charge and he said, ""oh yeah, these things have been doing that when it shouldn't, did you want me to take it off your bill?"" I said, so you knew about this and didn't say anything? I suggest you let your customers know in advance and you should check the bill beforehand! He said, ""Oh, good idea."" Wow!

Party of 9.  It was 8pm when we arrived.  Got sat and took forever to get greeted by our server.  When she came over to take our drink order she didn't crack a darn smile on her face and seemed very impatient..Trust me I've been a server before and you better work for your tips and I learned all my customer skills from being a server! Anyways we order ours drinks and entree at the same time because who knew how long it'll take her to get the drinks to us and our food out.  Yup our drinks took a while to come out then our food came out slowly...she never stopped by again to check on how everything was. We needed drinks refilled and all our bottomless sides refilled and we see her standing there texting...finally the manager I'm assuming comes by to take our refill order and brings it out to us. Our server comes up to us to let us know another server will be taking care of us and walks away.  So yep we ended up only tipping 15% when we usually tip 20%.. but I got the root beer float and bacon cheeseburger which was alright..I'm not really a fan of this place or their food even though I keep wanting to give it a try..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles?start=40

The atmosphere was live and active and with tons of unique pictures and posters to make you look around to see what's on them. I especially did this too. The service was great too.  Until I went here just recently. When I saw the outside, I saw that there had been a remodeling of the outside. The logo had been changed and the whole building's color was a dark red. Just dark red. (I thought ""how can people see this place at night when the sign lights are out"") then when I went inside, I was shocked in HORROR of what the remodels were: 1. The front lobby: the arcade was taken out, the seating was the same, and there is this 20' tall chalkboard that takes up 1/4 of the tiny corner wall. I waited about 15-20 minutes, not a waiting time to complain about too much (yet?) 2. The seating area: about 97% of the pictures were GONE. The seats were the same though. I felt like the place was ginormous instead of small because of all of the stuff that was taken out of there. The atmosphere was bland and empty. So when I got seated I ordered my drink, and it took FOREVER. If it takes 10-15 minutes to get a drink, then there is a (small) problem. While I were waiting, still about the drink, there were other waited asking me if I had been served yet. Then my drink came finally. Our waiter apologize for the long wait. Then I ordered our food and we waited for triple the time I waited for my drink. I only got checked on about once in the 9 years I waited for food. Also, I hadn't got silverware yet, and guess what? There was no silverware! So I had to wait about 5 minutes for silverware to be washed and be given to me.  Eventually I got my food. Again the waiter apologized and left. The food (as always) was delicious. Why couldn't I get food faster if it was this food? After I ate my food I waited another 5 years for my waiter to come. I got my bill and put the money in there. Then the waiter took the money without a smile nor thank you nor ""do you need change?"" Our waiter didn't return after that. And so I left, with me being disappointed with my experience. The verdict: I was sorely disappointed with my experience. The food and drinks were delicious. The service was iffy and the waiting times were ridiculous. Final rating: 8.0/10 +Good food and drinks +The honey mustard (as always) -Iffy service -Long waiting times -Bland and empty atmosphere Even though I was disappointed, I still recommend this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles?start=40

Julie S.,"Northern, VA",1,73,,3.0,6/11/2015,"3 stars overall ONLY because the food was and is really good and managed to salvage an otherwise crappy dinner experience...  My review is from a visit about 3 weeks ago which I neglected to fully finish/post. 1) 2 adults for dinner on a thurs night and they automatically seat us in the bar at a high table in an already crowded bar area that is so loud I can't hear my husband across the table.  We are seated right next to a lower table of 3 people that one guy is talking so loudly to his tablemates it is as if we are in their conversations because I didn't miss a word about his entire company and the testing going on as well as prepartions for exams and such and expected results.  His tablemates had smaller voices so I only heard half their responses. 2) Waitress took a crazy long time to come by and greet us, so long that we were ready to order our food when she also took our drink order. 3) Some other person came by while going to another table and dropped off a plate with napkins, forks, knives on it on our table.  No talking to us/no greeting, just placed it on the table as he walked by.  (Kind of weird.) 4) Our food shows up and it's good.  Price point of a $10.00 burger with unlimited fries is ok with me. ( I guess I am cheap and don't think a $14-$15 burger is going to be worth the extra dough though and stear clear of those.)  Unfortunately, waitress didn't come back to check on us for a long time (we were both almost done) and drinks had been drained for a good long time and hubs wanted refills on the unlimited broccoli - he's so healthy.  It took forever for the server to return and ask about those as I said before we were both practically done with our meal and our sides were long finished.  We still ordered them and it took a long time for the refills to arrive.  All in all, the food salvaged the rating, the setting was horrible (too loud in bar area), the food was good, the service needs some serious work.  Greet your customers in a reasonable amount of time and don't forget to check in on them about refills and to ensure everything is ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles?start=80

They've got good, huge, hearty burgers and other delicious sides like onion rings and spinach and artichoke dip. The service has been okay. Sometimes it's really loud in there - a lot of families with little kids.

Christina M.,"Leesburg, VA",0,17,,3.0,7/11/2014,"Husband and I went to RR last night.  We've been here numerous times and each time the food comes out fast and hot.   The difference last night was that they are redecorating.  They have re-done the bar area with high-top tables and it is more ""adult"".  We were seated here and noticed that while we were here, they proceeded to seat other child-free adults here also.  It is a welcome, refreshing change from the other side.  Good lord!  I went to the restroom and the mass of screaming children, running everywhere, ugh!.  It was so nice on the ""adult"" side.  When I went back to my table, I noticed that you can't even hear all that offensive screaming. What a nice change!

Antonio M.,"Washington, DC",342,401,727,3.0,2/10/2011,"**3.5 Stars** First of all, don't laugh at me for reviewing this or any other Red Robin.  Yes, I love a really great tasting burger and still think that Ray's Hellburger is THE definition of a perfect burger in the DMV area.  So why would I visit this place?  Well my friend, why don't you sign up on their website to get a FREE burger on your birthday?!?!  Hell yeah!  That's what I'm talking about!! So the burgers are okay, and they may have a ton of cool ass toppings you can pile on your burger but they're just ""meh"".  Now what motivated me to write this review is that fact that although they have ""meh"" burgers, the service was friggin AWESOME!  The best way to judge good service and the reaction of your server is when you arrive at any restaurant and flash your free/discounted food item coupon thingy. I did this on purpose when I arrived to this Red Robin and kind of expected to be snubbed or to be ignored for other paying customers.  This was not the case.  I sat at the bar (as I was dining alone) and decided I would order myself a frosty cold brew.  The bartender was a young kid who looked like he may be barely over 21 and he greeted me with a boisterous ""Welcome to Red Robin!"". After returning his hello with a similarly enthusiastic ""Thank you"", I showed him my birthday burger coupon and asked him, ""is it okay if I use this at the bar?"" to which he happily said, ""Of course sir!  By the way, Happy Birthday!"". Sir?  Hmmph!  Kidding... Anyway, I ordered a beer and scanned the burger menu.  Red Robin has a dizzying variety of burgers topped with whatever you can imagine: - Guac - Tortilla strips - Pineapple - Bacon - all sorts of different cheeses - too many to list here The bartender handed my beer and I still hadn't found anything I really wanted.  Most of the burger options looked good, but I wasn't in the mood for read meat and the chicken sandwich options just didn't have the same cool toppings as the burgers.  I called the bartender over and asked him, ""Can I order any one of your signature burgers and substitute the burger patty for a chicken breast?"" ""Sure!  That's no problem!  Which burger would you like?"" I ordered the Guacamole Bacon Burger which came with ""Freshly prepared, zesty guacamole and applewood smoked bacon with melted Swiss cheese, onions, crisp lettuce, tomatoes & mayo"" but had him substitute the burger for a chicken breast and said, ""hold the bacon and mayo son"". For those of you that don't know this, all burgers come with a never ending (basically an ALL  YOU  CAN  EAT) serving of french fries.  This is mondo dangerous for a french fries loving fat boy such as myself....  As I waited, the bartender brought over a basket of fries for me to enjoy with my cold pint of cerveza.  Oh man, carb heaven!  I polished off the basket of fries by the time my chicken sandwich arrived.  The chicken sandwich was pretty big and was served on a nice big bed of more french fries.  The chicken was perfectly cooked and tender and the topping were EXACTLY what I wanted.  The bartender kept on coming over to check up on me and probably sensed my love affair with fries, that without asking kept me well supplied with piping hot servings of fries.   After I finished up my food, I thanked him and asked for the bill.  Bringing the bill over he once again wished me a happy birthday and thanked me for stopping by.  Funny to see that the only thing charged on my bill was my single pint of beer.  I made sure to tip him generously as if I had paid for the entire full price meal.   This was THE best big chain service I had ever experienced and it passed my free food coupon test.  Kudos to the management for hiring this bartender and I really wish other places had staff that loved their job and enthusiastically worked to make their customers happy.  Way to go Red Robin!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles?start=80
Amie B.,"Leesburg, VA",28,19,,1.0,7/25/2013,"My boyfriend and I used to go to Red Robin regularly. It has gone so downhill and is so disappointing. The jalapeno coins were way greasy and hard to eat. We waited for over 40 minutes for our food. When it came, the chicken in my wrap was cold. My boyfriend's order was a chicken salad. It came with cheese, which he said to leave out and the chicken felt like it had just come out of the fridge.  When we brought this up, he was given a new salad, but nothing else was done to make up for the bad service and lengthy wait (when you are on a time crunch for lunch, it is a big deal). The biggest issue I have with Red Robin now is that about 2 hours after the meal, we were both sick.

When we walked in, the place was fairly busy. The waiting area was full. We walked up to the podium, where a young man was slouched with his elbows on the podium, face down looking at the tablet. I had to greet him, when it should have been the other way around. I told him we had a party of 3, he stated there would be a 20 minute wait, and took my name down. We stood in the waiting area, which was filthy. One bench had balled up napkins on it. I looked up and there was a huge sagging bubble in the ceiling, about 2 feet in diameter. Next to it was a spot in the ceiling where the paint had fallen off. About 10 minutes into our wait, a female employee came out and announced to everyone that they would be closing the kitchen, and that she apologized that we had waited so long and that she understood if we wanted to go somewhere else.

Our appetizer came out within 10 minutes of ordering. We finished our appetizer and proceeded to wait about 35 minutes before we had a manager come over and tell us that their ticket system in the kitchen didn't get our order in and that our burgers were just now being cooked. About 15 minutes later our food came out about 12:50. Meanwhile, every single table around us received their food on time (even those who came in 15-20 minutes behind us and ended up finishing before we even received our food). Clearly there was no problem with their ticket system for all of the other customers seated around us. And clearly there was no issue with our appetizer (which was on the same ticket as our order) coming out on time. It was obvious our order just wasn't put in. Otherwise the kitchen would have been backed up on everyone's order, not just ours. Once we received our food, we had to ask for sides that we had requested when we placed the order and waited for those to come out. The food itself was extremely average. Not great. When we got our bill we got the ""manager special"" which was $2.00 off of our total bill of $35. To be honest, I thought this was pretty poor considering we waited nearly a hour to be served 2 simple burgers.  Overall, we won't be coming back.

I should have read the reviews more carefully beforehand because this was a HUGE MISTAKE. We came in around 5:30 PM and they were not busy. There were also a lot of waiters and waitresses on duty during that time as well.  After being seated we waited for a while. I told my husband that if we don't get serve in the next 5 minutes I want to leave. He said it will be okay. We even try to call out one of the hostess but she didn't hear us I guess. Then after about maybe 15 mins of waiting a white couple was seated in the same section as us. Thus, I wanted to do a little experiment to see if they get served before us. Then I went to the bathroom and came back out and behold the other couple who sat down for just 5 minutes had a server asking them what they wanted to drink. While we have already waited for a little bit over 20 minutes now. That was the last straw and we left. I would have given them a zero star if yelp had that option.  Also, I have eaten at other at Red Robin before but never have the service been this appalling. Guess the service is consistently horrible considering the other reviews as well.  Maybe if the waiters, waitresses, and hostess wasn't flirting with each other they would have been able to do their jobs.

I really wish that they would enforce the ""Over 21"" policy in the bar area. I have no kids, so it would be nice to have a spot in the restaurant that I could sit and not be surrounded by screaming kids.

Robbie E.,"Leesburg, VA",18,38,29,5.0,2/23/2015,"We have been to this location and others many times with various experiences ranging from poor to great.  This particular time was as good as it gets.  Our server, Alvin, was outstanding.  He made sure our drinks never went dry, brought us extra sauces and made sure we had everything we wanted.  Everyone's food was great as well.  I had fish and chips this time and it was perfectly prepared.  When we asked for more fries, Alvin made sure to get us fresh one's right out of the fryer.  Highly recommended.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles?start=60
Sean P.,"Ashburn, VA",70,180,65,3.0,7/22/2013,"I've been here a few times since moving into the area, and have issues with this Red Robin... though it's not technically Red Robin's fault. The issue? It's overly loud due to kids screaming, crying and vying for attention (Parents: NO! STOP! BAD!). I don't want to drop stars on a restaurant because of this, but I find it makes it REALLY hard to enjoy coming here. It's been pretty consistent every single time I've been here, and this makes me a sad panda. The food is great, reliable and pretty tasty. Red Robin's grub is above average for burgers, and I'm a definite fan of the Royal Red (with a fried egg!) and the Chili ""I will wear this on my shirt with shame"" Chili burger. Burger-wise, I don't necessarily think they Red Robin holds a candle to their competition (a certain restaurant involving a quintet of gentlemen). It's pretty good though, so no real complaints on that end. All in all, it's a decent place for a burger (if you can stand the potential screaming/yelling kids). I'd give it 4 stars if it weren't for that, but the atmosphere really brings it down for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles?start=60
Mike F.,"Washington, DC",83,150,60,4.0,11/13/2014,"Okay it is a chain and it is not the best burger around BUT my kids love it, I do love the banzai burger or chicken version, the service is always good, and they have a very good selection of drinks.  Last visit my son ordered the pretzel bites and raved about them - they were really good and the cheese sauce added to their yumminess.  It is always in the running when we are looking to eat at the Dulles Town Center area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles?start=60
M R.,"Leesburg, VA",28,2,,1.0,2/12/2015,"Something's happened with this restaurant, and it ain't good.    Redecorating a restaurant shouldn't affect the Service and overall experience, but something has happened since that took place. Pretty much the whole staff was replaced, and the new Servers are not the greatest.   Drinks, ketchup, napkins, silverware, and even an appetizer, are typically overlooked and it seems to be the norm.  Every visit,  something goes wrong. We came in this evening to an empty host area-no host, no other customer's waiting,  the front was completely empty.   After standing around for a few minutes we are greeted and asked how many in the party.  I said 1 adult and 3 kids and the host looks at the dining area,  then at her map,  and then at me and says its going to be about a 20 minute wait.   Wait what?  I looked at about 5 empty tables and then back to the half empty parking lot and then chuckled at the host, asking if she is serious,  there's no one here,  how can there be a 20 minute wait?!   She leaves to go assess the dining room and comes back and the wait went down to 5 minutes. Why is there a wait when the restaurant is half empty? I'll tell ya why, because the place is just going down hill.   There must be management change or policy change that was put into effect and its chased any Server with a brain or half a mind to run far away. The vibe is just awful.    No music,  No sound to the TV's,  just the sound of deep fryer alarms and glasses breaking.   And it seems like no one in there has ever heard of Pre bussing a table, not even the Managers walking around with empty hands care to stop and pick up some empty plates.

We are eventually seated. We waited for 15 min.... watched all the servers standing in the server area chatting and laughing...and not taking our drink order.

Vicky C.,"Leesburg, VA",186,278,10,3.0,2/14/2013,"So it's Valentines Day which means we were at Red Robin tonight.  Might sound odd, but my son - who turned 7 today - was talked out of going to Chuck E Cheese or Pizza Go Round for his birthday dinner and opted for someplace ""fancy"" this year - Red Robin.  And there you have it.   I had the salad, it was good. The honey mustard is the bomb. The adults all seemed to be satisfied with the food.  My son, however, complained about the Grilled Cheese being ""sour"" (I tasted it - it's sort of bland, definitely made me look like a gourmet comparatively).  So we had to re-order.  He was satisfied with the chicken strips meal but they did not offer to remove the grilled cheese from our bill - and considering there were 4 adults and 2 kids, I thought they should have.  My daughter ordered an appetizer of ribs but she found them spicy, so my adult son and husband split them and we ordered her a burger which made her content. The service was good.  Everyone was friendly.  It's clean.  It's priced reasonably.   I miss the ""Mixology"" drinks they used to have (non-alcoholic and very fun mixed drinks).  Kids loved them but I am guessing they're off the menu because they were pricey and if every family is like mine, we simply didn't let the kids order the ""expensive"" drinks very often. Listen, compared to Chuck E Cheese or Pizza Go Round this was a big score.  In the end everyone was happy and no one had a headache. Oh - and my son was too full to eat much of his ""FREE"" Birthday Sunday although he definitely enjoyed receiving it. PS - if you are thinking that Valentines Day is a cool birthday, think again... well, if you're the mom.  The day after he was born it hit me:  I will never have another Valentines Day again.  Seven years later I can attest that it's true.  But it's worth it... when you tell my Devon that he is sweet he always says ""I was born on Valentines Day, what did you expect?""  My little Cupid.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles?start=60

If you eat in and get a burger you can get some fries to start off instead of blowing $$$ on an app, get some interesting dipping sauce while you're at it.  The restaurant area is SUPER noisy, there's nothing to block the sound from other people and if it's crowded you're basically shouting at the other people you sit with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles?start=60

My first impression was the bartender, Jon I believe was his name, whom I could tell really didn't want to be there that night. He was very impersonable, and acted overwhelmed although there was really very little going on. The bar area seemed to be the place for the wait staff to come hang out while they weren't working the floor and talk about their customers which I found very unprofessional. I ordered a salad as an appetizer and a burger. It seemed like at least ten minutes before my salad arrived, followed 3 minutes later by my burger so as I'm trying to finish my salad the burger and fries are getting chilled by the vent above me. By the time I got to eating my meal the fries were cool to the touch. The burger was average and I needed to get out of there so I just choked it all down and headed on my way.

Told our waiter and let it go, the food took longer then anticipated, but we were enjoying the Nats game so not a big deal. My fiancees burger came out lukewarm, but he was hungry at this point and just started eating. Then the manager came over, apologized by saying they've never had a bug problem before and they do a weekly cleanliness inspection ( I think maybe an outside inspector is in order?) and offered dessert, we declined. He told us the app would be taken off the bill. My meal was the veggies and hummus appetizer, it looked good until I picked up a zucchini slice and found a hair stuck on it. As the manager was right there I pointed this little extra he was surprised and apologized again.  That was it for me, I had lost my appetite.

The spinach dip and onion rings are great appetizers -- the spin dip comes with pita AND veggies, which I really appreciate.  And the smoky ranch dip that comes with the onion rings is delicious. My two favorite burgers are the Whiskey River BBQ and the Banzai Burger - great, interesting flavor combinations that actually taste good, even if you can only get your patty cooked ""pink"" or ""no pink.""  Seriously, I'm a rare-beef girl, and I don't even care (I actually get veggie patties most of the time) - the toppings make the meal. The fries are free refills, but honestly I've never even thought about asking for more. The service is hit-or-miss...I've learned that if you don't expect too much you won't be disappointed: this place isn't fine dining, folks.  As long as the food is right and my glass is kept mostly full, I'm happy.
