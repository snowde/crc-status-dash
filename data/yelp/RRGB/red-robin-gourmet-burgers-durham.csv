Evan S.,"Roanoke, VA",0,23,,4.0,7/16/2017,It's the basic Red Robin with the usual fare. Very good burgers and excellent service. Wait staff was very attentive and was fairly quick in bringing the items we had ordered.  Best of all our orders were correct the first time.  The food presentation was appealing and made us smile.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham
Brad R.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,5,,3.0,10/18/2017,I like the burgers and bottomless fries. Service is good. Only reason for three stars.  No wireless.  I wouldn't have come here had I Known. I often use this time to reply to emails or just relax by watching video.  Can't do it at red robin.   Get with the 21sr century.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham
Roger K.,"Raleigh, NC",466,308,3692,4.0,3/1/2017,Red Robin is always good. Great food if you love hamburgers. I'm not a beef fan so I eat more chicken. Their menu doesn't have as many awesome chicken sandwiches but it's still good food. Love the bottomless fries! The bar isn't that bad either. The server that worked on my order was friendly and she made great suggestions. 4stars for Red Robin. I tend to grade hard FYI lol.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham
Brenda Y.,"Durham, NC",259,105,76,4.0,9/18/2016,"These burgers are delicious. Pair 'em up with bottomless steak fries (fresh & crispy), table-side seasoning (what's in that?!), honey mustard (dat synergy with the fries), and freckled lemonade and ohhhhh boy! The ""foodies"" I know tend to ignore chains, but good 'ol RR deserves a shout-out. This place and Dain's on 9th are in a deadheat for my burger heart. I also enjoyed being able to pay with a credit card from the tablet thing on the table. Fun & efficient.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham
Elizabeth G.,"Fayetteville, NC",35,105,136,3.0,1/28/2016,I'm really not a fan of the change in decor. I preferred the previous atmosphere it was more fun and whimsical. The change seems more boring than upscale. Still can't beat their burgers although you can easily beat the price. $12.99 for the more specialized ones still seems like a bit much. Really like the freckled lemonade and the blue moon milkshake though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham
Steve S.,"Reidsville, NC",0,19,,2.0,12/29/2016,Waitress had a lot of trouble knowing beers and prices as well as what is/is not on tap. I told waitress to go ahead and bring me a second fry to save her a trip. She just smiled and left.  VERY SLOW. @ 15 minutes from seating to take order. After 22 minutes order came. Good taste but slapped together liked McDonald's. I asked for more fries and 10 minutes later and asking again I got more. Had to ask soft drink prices because they aren't listed. Finally settled for water. Oh well I guess I need to stick with Wendy's or the king.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham

Jorge A.,"Orange City, FL",51,108,289,5.0,2/19/2015,"Since my very first visit to Red Robin, I have been a fan. Those juicy beef patties, the never ending fries, and the thick yet smooth milkshakes. So delicious.  As we were driving on the interstate and saw the sign saying Red Robin, my wife and I instantly knew what was for dinner that night. The rest of the day was spent anticipating that savory meal. The restaurant was located right off the interstate exit, which was very convenient since we're unfamiliar with this area. There was plenty of parking as well, also convenient. Once inside, everything was properly organized and clean. Very appealing, visually.  The waitress was friendly and took our order with no issues, everything was presented to us exactly as it was ordered (which isn't always the case). Overall it was a great experience and we would happily return for another visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham
David C.,"Durham, NC",0,7,1,1.0,2/24/2017,"Terribly slow and apathetic service.  Apparently our wait staff would rather talk amongst themselves than assist paying customers.  Glasses were filthy, table wasn't cleaned for us (crumbs and sauce all over it).  Salt and pepper shakers looked dirty as well with gunk and hair on it.  Management needs to rethink how to run the business appropriately.  They will not be having my business anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham
Adam B.,"Durham, NC",154,337,1051,3.0,12/8/2014,"So if this place weren't just down the street from home, I would probably never come here. But since it is, I sometimes do and it's OK. The kitchen here is pretty consistent and they will customize your order and get it right. At least, they always have for me. There's not a lot that's particularly healthy on the menu, but you probably shouldn't come here expecting that anyway.  The bar area usually has pretty quick service and you can have a beer while you wait.

Nina B.,"Durham, NC",297,282,40,4.0,1/29/2013,"So what if it's a chain? Red Robin consistently delivers delicious burgers and great service! The real testament to Red Robin is that it's a family-friendly place with tons of kids around, and I *still* want to go. At this particular location, I've sat at the bar, at a table in the bar area, and in the main seating area a couple times as well. The main dining area might have more kids, but the bar area can be kind of tight. Take your pick. On one visit, the host sat us right next to the bathroom and we could smell something foul from our table. Luckily, they weren't busy (so someone should be free to freshen up the bathroom, no?), and we moved booths without a problem. Our server was very understanding and apologetic. I almost always get a Banzai burger (grilled pineapple, FTW), but will enjoy the occasional California chicken sandwich plus some golden, crispy bottomless fries. And if you're really hungry, get the fried mushrooms. It's cool--they're vegetables.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham
Karman K.,"Durham, NC",297,203,39,3.0,9/9/2013,"... Yum... ish?! I went the unlimited salad route so I'm not sure I really get to make a judgement call on the menu as a whole, I did share some of my hubs' burger & fries.  Our waiter Brian was great.  I was a little disappointed with the small serving sizes, though.  They used to serve baskets of fries and now they're in these trendy little silver cups.  At least a third of the previous portion, but I'm sure they're saving a lot of food that used to have been wasted.   I feel like I go to Red Robin more for the atmosphere than the food, which is kinda less than stellar.  The burgers are interesting and they have several new sauces which are fun, but the overall taste factor is lacking.  I'm pretty serious about my burgers.  Overall, based on smaller portion sizes and lack of knock-me-off-my feet flavor, I give it 3 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham

They got my refill and silverware for me. Then someone else brought out my food. I asked them for the seasoning, ketchup and another refill. 10 mins later no one has showed. Had to go to the bar to ask. Then my server appears asking if I want my check. I haven't eaten my now cold food. Oh! And to top it off, my bigger was charred black! Tried eating it. Blech.

Mohamed N.,"Durham, NC",227,336,480,4.0,5/1/2010,"""Good burgers, bottomless fries, friendly service"" Yes, it's ""corporate"", but it really is good.  I like their many burger styles a lot- I usually get the teriyaki burger (LOVE the pineapple on it), but today, I enjoyed their patty melt on marbled rye bread with sauteed onions and thousand island dressing.  That said, I've never had a burger here that I didn't enjoy thoroughly.  For those avoiding red meat, they'll fix a turkey burger or fix a chicken sandwich with the same trimmings.  The fries are bottomless but ""Meh..."" in taste (except the garlic parmesan ones- those are quite good), but you can substitute them for onion rings for 99 cents.  Shakes and floats are really good here, too, but hard to imagine how to make a bad shake. The service at this store is generally very good.  We've never had a long wait to be seated here, even on a Saturday night.  The servers are typically very attentive (rare exceptions), and the manager often swings by to confirm everything is OK.  Food is out within 20 minutes (sometimes 10).  Importantly, too, the managers make every effort to make up for any problem- we had a big delay on shakes one time, and when I mentioned it in my comment card, the manager called and gave my entire family free shakes for the next visit! The price is not cheap- most burgers are ~$9 before tax and tip.  But it is good food, and there are specials periodically for particular burgers (the patty melt meal was $7.99 tonight).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham

Nollie M.,"Chapel Hill, NC",0,6,,1.0,4/30/2016,We decided to give this particular red robin one more chance after our fiasco last visit where we were seated but waited 10 min before even having a drink order taken. And even then the manager had to be summoned to do so. This time we sat for 20 min without a server before having to go find a hostess to get us our drinks. Only some of the drinks were delivered. 20 minutes they were still making my daughters Oj at the bar apparently. 10 more min went by before a server came to take our order. I ordered a chicken sandwich with pepper jack cheese in a little wrap. It's on the menu. I got asked twice to verify my order because the cooks told the server what I ordered wasn't on the menu. Simply grilled chicken sandwich. Look it up. Apparently the pepper jack threw them off. It was ten min before the server came back to verify the order which meant my sandwich STILL had not been rung in. 45 minutes after arriving and food was just being sent through...do not come here if you hope to eat in any sort of timely manner.

Fish and Chips were delicious but could of been seasoned prior to being fried. I really like the choose two appetizer, I had cheese sticks and sweet potato fries, I would definitely recommend these two. SERVICE: My waitress was Keara, she was such a great server, she answered all of our questions, was polite, and very caring with napkins and refills.   The interior decorations was very odd, it was part carnival, air tubes, and framed pictures.  And the floors were EXTREMELY slippery, most likely due to grease build up and not because of water.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham?start=20
Andrew F.,"Kalamazoo, MI",218,107,62,4.0,5/1/2013,"Ah, Red Robin.  How magical you were when we first met.  The tantalizing taboo of a fried egg on a burger!  In my youth, I was blinded by the novelty.  Actually, their burgers were pretty rocking.  In the last decade, I've watched the quality of their patties decline but I think the menu has had somewhat of a renaissance in the last year or so.  The meat still doesn't stack up, but they offer many more healthful options including a lettuce wrap for your sandwich, which I highly recommend.  And as always, my first love, the Royal Red Robin burger w/ the fried egg on top.  DANG, SON.  ON A BURGER! For the Durham location: standard fare as far as Red Robins go.  If you haven't been in a couple years,  I'd give it a try.  We've had consistently good service (we go primarily for free birthday burgers these days), and it delivers when you want to eat a burger and dine out in a casual environment. No real complaints here, but just know that you aren't ordering (or paying for) a Bull City Burger and Brewery burger.  Just ease on in and bury yourself in some bottomless fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham?start=20
Karl S.,"Raleigh, NC",13,56,12,3.0,7/1/2013,"It has been awhile since I have been to a Red Robin. When I first went years ago in Virginia not many places could stand p to their burgers. I loved their Chili Burger which was served open faced because you couldn't pick it up.  Now adays the Chili Burger is still the best thing on the menu with the possible exception of the Tower of Onion Rings. The steak fries are good and the fruity drinks are nice as well. The food is served in little plastic baskets which I find to be a little off putting but it masks the fact that the burgers are a little small and they fill up the rest of the tiny basket with fries.I usually enjoy my food, but beware it will hit you like a lead brick about 30 minutes after you leave,  The wait staff is awsome. We have never had to wait for refills, they normally just bring them out without you having to ask. The food is always fresh and hot even if I wished they would used different patties for the burgers.  Decent food.

Lauren P.,"Bailey, CO",123,200,161,4.0,2/17/2013,"I'm a fan of Red Robin because Red Robin has gluten free buns for their burgers. No more am I resolved to eating a naked, bunless burger. Here, at Red Robin I am able to enjoy holding and caressing my medium rare burger as it falls apart into the abyss that is my mouth. No, seriously, it's a good bun, but that thing falls apart in a heartbeat. They've got some other main meals that are gluten free, but there's nothing particular else to call out about the menu. Pretty much everything is covered in flour and fried.  It is nice to know that the manager brings over your food if you mention the gluten free bun is because of an allergy. And it's doubly nice that the waiter sometimes remembers to call that point out if you do happen to order something else that has gluten in it. I've often noticed that restaurants forget to teach waitstaff that if someone says they have an allergy and then go order a common appetizer like ""jalapeno poppers"" they should say sometime. Then again, I'm not a waitress, so who knows? This particular location also has a nice outdoor seating area.

After being greeted at the door by a man dressed in a robin costume my party and I were shuffled cattle style to a booth where we were doled out picture book style menus very handy for the illiterate to point and mumble what they would like to dine on to a waitress that looked about as happy to be there as someone undergoing an out outpatient procedure. I ordered the hunk of burning love burger with the thought that if nothing else the heat of the sauce would drown out the hum drum taste. No such luck.

Duke C.,"Hillsborough, NC",52,148,4,1.0,10/3/2010,Question: What do you do when the restaurant manager tells you the reason there is dirt on your dinner is because they don't actually wash the vegetables?   Answer: Give it 1 star and Yelp and run the other way.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham?start=40
Megan N.,"Durham, NC",4,24,1,5.0,2/18/2013,"You come here for burgers that are a step up from Only Burger. They are great, and the sweet potato fries for an extra dollar fifty are GREAT. I highly suggest splurging the extra buck fifty, because the normal fries are NOT GOOD. I tend to get the Banzai Burger- with cheddar cheese and pineapple, the Bleu Ribbon Burger, with bleu cheese and onion strips, or the Sauteed Shroom Burger, with SO MANY mushrooms.   If you get the shroom burger, put the Red Robin Seasoning on it, adds a great touch to a slightly bland burger. The price is, as expected, a bit higher than other places, but the quality makes up for it. Most of the servers are very friendly, but as expected a bit busy with the Friday night crowd. Finish up the evening (or afternoon) with one of their amazing shakes, or a root beer float.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham?start=40
Jane Y.,"Cary, NC",155,347,98,3.0,1/10/2011,"Great service. The fries weren't as good as my usual location back in MD, and the burger was a little sloppy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham?start=40
Sean T.,"Durham, NC",0,5,,3.0,11/5/2014,Good food but don't go there for lunch.  They are so slow that you will not make it back to work on time....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham?start=40
Jessica L.,"Durham, NC",30,25,23,4.0,5/11/2013,"I'm a long-time fan of Red Robin. Definitely your all-American restaurant. Diner-type foods, with a much better quality. AWESOME thick-cut fries. Great burgers with TONS of options. I'm also a huge fan of the Strawberry Lemonade - alcoholic or virgin. We went there for my boyfriend's birthday (it was his first time there) and he LOVED it. He ate the whole onion ring tower by himself :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham?start=40
Jeremy J.,"Raleigh, NC",0,60,14,4.0,1/2/2014,Very nice meal at a higher price than expected. This Red Robin has a nice environment and service. I recommend their excellent burgers and bottomless fries.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham?start=40
Darrell L.,"Cedar Grove, NC",1,15,27,1.0,6/22/2012,"I drove to Durham last night all charged up for all you can eat fries.  The manager sat us at our table and we sat there for 15 minutes.  No server came and said they would be with us in a minute, no server asked us what we wanted to drink it was like we were invisible to the staff.  Then we got up to leave and I said goodbye to the manager that sat us she never even remembered that she sat us and we were leaving already.  No excuse or apology nothing.  I would not knock a buisness like this typically but they had plenty of employees working and only seven tables to serve.  Would have understood if they had been swamped with customers.  BAD SERVICE go accross the street to Five-Guy's Burgers and Fries the food is better anyway!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham?start=40
Steve B.,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",1,40,1,2.0,4/1/2011,"Dirtier than I remember. I've been to a few RR's in other states, but for some reason remembered them as being a bit more ""upscale"" (relative to other burger restaurants). The server was really friendly - though he did sit down and tell us this convoluted story about a quasi adoption situation after his sister went to prison. Really wild. Overall, not sure that I would return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham?start=40
Samantha E.,"Chicago, IL",103,1199,2058,5.0,1/31/2011,A chain but an absolutely divine burger. Every time I bite into a Royal Red Robin my taste buds dance. The garlic fries are soooo good and the cookies and cream milkshake just make the meal! Definitely a good spot!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham?start=40
joanne p.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",0,24,,4.0,4/21/2010,Great place to go if you are craving a good burger. You can pretty much get anything you could ever want on a burger. My personal fave is the Whiskey River BBQ burger it comes with bbq sauce and fried onion straws on it. The garlic parmesan fries are also very good. I think there is a small charge for them but they are also unlimited.  I've always had pretty good service at this location. Haven't really been there when it was super busy though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham?start=40
MustangQT M.,"Houston, TX",9,123,,4.0,1/3/2010,I love the burgers here! Have always been happy when I leave and my boyfriend's parents loved it there as well.  Our server was a really friendly girl and she always checked in on us and when we ordered an ice cream cake for dessert it was so big it took the whole group to eat it! I'd recommend going there for a casual burger dinner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham?start=40
Claire N.,"Durham, NC",0,64,,3.0,7/17/2007,"This was the first time I have been to this location.  I have visited the location in Brier Creek in Raleigh a few times and have been very pleased with my experience there.  This Durham location was disappointing.  The food was still great, but the service was not good.  Yes, they offer unlimited steak fries in theory, but if you can't get the attention of your server to get them, then you're really not being offered them.  Also, my tea ran completely empty twice, and it took some doing to get the waiter's attention for a refill. So, great food, just like the other locations, but lacking in service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham?start=60
