Amber S.,"Washburn, IL",57,9,,4.0,1/15/2017,My favorite thing to order here is the ghost tavern burger. I always order the sauce on the side because it is really spicy and I only need a little for the heat that I like. Plus dipping the sweet potato fries in it is delicious!  Bathrooms are clean. Service is good. Some people think the price is too high but the quality of the food makes it worth the price.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-east-peoria

Lawrence C.,"Normal, IL",36,172,219,4.0,12/1/2016,"I walked into Red Robin's wearing a shirt featuring a cat wearing a crown. One the ladies working there dubbed me the Cat King. A nickname I have kept since that day. We had a small conversation about her cats before the hostess seated us.  The thing that sells me on Red Robin's the most is the fry refills. Although, it seems they kind of skimp on the amount of fries you get in the first place to make up for it. I usually get the Pig Out Tavern burger since I like bacon. They have several choices of burgers but I can't convince myself to branch out.  The service is hit or miss. One time we faked ourselves, What happened to our waitress!?""

Curry D.,"O'Fallon, IL",21,10,21,4.0,5/28/2016,"My family and I recently ate at this Red Robin at my daughter's request. We had a large party and knew in advance when we would be arriving. I called 2 days before just to alert them we would be coming. I knew they did not take reservations, but I alerted them mostly as a courtesy. The female manager was very friendly and took down our info. When we arrived, we were not disappointed. The staff went above and beyond to get a table setting for us so we were seated all together.  I was also incredibly impressed with our server Spencer. It was very chaotic with everyone, and he was on top of everything. He split the bill correctly, got refills in a timely manner, made sure everyone's order was correct, and he had a great attitude and smile the whole time. My daughter's burger was well instead of pink, but it came back quick. My son and I both ordered milk shakes for dessert and they were just ""okay"". I expected many more cookie pieces and the shake was very thin. The prices are a little high for the quality and getting burgers at the right temp seems to be an issue, so that is why the 4 star rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-east-peoria

Every time I've been in, it's crazy. Which makes me like it even more because once seated,  you don't even realize it's busy.

Jan X.,"Peoria, IL",0,15,,4.0,7/8/2015,"I have been several times since Red Robin opened in EP.  I have had outstanding service in the bar area, where I prefer to sit, and pretty good service in the dining area.  I was not pleased when I informed my server that I had a free burger for my birthday and she told me we would take care of that at the end.  Of course she forgot and had to redo the bill.  I've also noticed if you request anything extra napkins, etc, the service is slow in the dining area.  As far as the food is concerned, I always order a Whiskey River Burger, regular fries (with 2 campfire sauces) and a freckled lemonade.  Compared to other Red Robins, the food quality is the same, but my food is never hot.  I have also tried the onion rings, chips and salsa, and boneless wings.  I love Red Robin, the taste of the Whiskey River Burger is amazing!   This is also a good place for my family as everyone loves burgers and I don't have to cook them!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-east-peoria

Nick S.,"Morton, IL",1,23,2,2.0,4/3/2014,"I've eaten at Red Robin in other cities before and liked the burgers.  The food at this restaurant is good, but the service has been consistently disappointing.  We just had our third visit, and it will be our last. The restaurant has elevated booths around the perimeter of the dining area.  None of these tables can accommodate a high chair.  If you have small children with you that require a high chair, over half of the tables in the restaurant aren't an option for you.  So, while they tell you that the wait is 20-30 minutes, they have to wait till one of the center tables opens up.  It's not the host's fault... but it's frustrating.  Our last visit was estimated to be a 20 minute wait, but turned out to be 45 minutes in their small/cold entry way with 3 small children.   Once we finally were seated, the only option was to have both high chairs on one side of a 4-top table.  Less than ideal, but at least we were seated.  We then waited over 10 minutes for a server.  None even walked by our table in that time that I could flag down.  Finally another customer flagged down his server and sent her to our table.  We then waited about 25 minutes for our food... not terrible, but difficult with children who have been waiting for over an hour at this point.  Once the food came, we waited an additional 5-7 minutes for silverware and napkins. The server was friendly, just not on top of her game and not in a hurry to do her job.  The manager visited our table, apologized for the wait, and offered us a free desert.  Very kind.  But  we've consistently been disappointed with their staff's ability to really put effort into taking care of the customer.  That's really what you're paying for at a place like this, in my opinion.  Burgers are burgers.  Service will make or break a restaurant.  And this establishment seems to be missing that mark.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-east-peoria

Upon arriving the man that sat us was cordial and polite. Our waiter on the other hand only saw us twice through the whole meal, we had to flag down another waiter to ask for refills. I didnt get part of my meal I ordered and the mayo was congealed. I saw a waiteess grab someones burger bun with her bare hand. Thats unsanitary. The server was rude the few times we did see him.

The food is good as well. I like that they have a Gluten Free bun for burgers because I have a wheat allergy. Only problem is that they charge more for it. This is frustrating because it's like I'm penalized for having an allergy! I realize this is probably a way to make money off the people who are fad dieting, but it's frustrating for the rest of us. I mean, I'm already paying $10 for a burger, you're making plenty of profit off of me.

Sierra S.,"Morton, IL",0,1,,1.0,2/27/2016,"I am so so disappointed in this EP Red Robin. I have been here multiple times before, and always great service. But this time, everything changed. First, the waitress would not let me order Mac + Cheese off the kids menu. I was stuck with nasty adult Mac + Cheese. When we got our food, I was given kids menu Mac + Cheese, so I was very happy. I started eating it, and my waitress came over and took it away. She then proceeded to give it to another family. After I ate it. There was a mistake and it wasn't my fault, therefore I shouldn't have had my Mac and cheese taken away and given the crappy adult Mac and cheese. The adult Mac is noodles with a little cheese sprinkled on it. I am thoroughly disappointed with this place. Also my Coke was warm, even though the cup was half filled with ice.

The service was great.  The server was attentive, fast, and orders were accurate.  I ordered the Burnin Love Burger but substituted the burger with grilled chicken and it was delicious.  My wife ordered the basic cheeseburger (and then added all the toppings) and daughter ordered the bacon cheeseburger and both loved it.

We were entertained looking over the decor, all the paintings on the ceiling look pretty cool. Our server was really great, very enthusiastic and full of suggestions for our meal. He immediately got us set up with the Red Robin rewards card and I registered on my phone so we were able to use it today for this order to get a discount. We are excited about the rewards they offer their customers. Our server offered suggestions when asked and we were both really happy with what he suggested. I started off by getting the bottomless root beer float! Red Robin you had me at bottomless root beer floats! Yum is right! :) We shared the half stack of onion rings and really enjoyed the campfire sauce. I got the Banzai burger and it was refreshing and delicious, I had that with the bottomless broccoli, nice to have an option other than fries. My boyfriend had the Western BBQ burger and he thought it was very good. It wasn't too messy, and was easier to eat than he expected it to be. Overall we had a great time at Red Robin. I look forward to going back and trying some of the adult beverages, very creative choices, Blue Moon mixed drinks, alcoholic milkshakes, and lots of yummy sounding fruity cocktails, I am intrigued!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-east-peoria?start=20

Chris C.,"Aurora, IL",2,6,,1.0,9/24/2013,"This was my first Red Robin experience ever and I was pretty excited about it because I always saw the commercials on TV, but we didn't have one in the area.  The commercials always made the burgers look so good (I know, I know... it's a commercial), but they advertise their burgers as ""gourmet"" so I assumed they knew what they were doing.   My wife and I arrived on a Tuesday night at around 6:15 pm and got in fairly quickly, maybe 15 minutes.  To put you on the wait list, they ask for your cell phone number and send you a text message when your table is ready.  We sat at a table for two and it was nicely lit.  Bring your jacket, because it's cold in there.  The server arrived promptly and got our drink orders.  Not sure if this was because she was new, or they just don't have any type of service protocol, but she didn't suggest any drinks or appetizers.  I ordered a Diet Coke and my wife ordered a lemonade.  The drinks came quickly.  We ordered The O Ring Shorty off of the $5 appetizer menu and I would give them an 8.5 out of 10 based on taste, a 6.5/10 based on value.  They were crunchy and not overly oily.  The entirety of the onion didn't come out when you bit into it, and it was accompanied by two sauces (ranch, and some other nice sauce... you didn't' get to choose these).  Value wise, we got 6 onion rings total and it came on some weird custom-made onion ring holder and they were stacked like a pyramid.  Overall, pretty disappointing when you take into consideration the price. For the entree, we ordered two burgers.  Weird thing... when they ask you how you want it cooked, they ask you ""do you want no pink, or a little pink?""  So if you're looking for a medium or medium rare burger, you're out of luck. For our main courses, I ordered the Prime Chophouse ($10.49) with a little pink, and my wife ordered the Burnin' Love ($10.29) with no pink (she's pregnant), no tomato and no salsa.  We both ordered our burgers with the corn jalapeno bun.  Mine came with an onion ring on top, and my wife's came with a grilled jalapeno on top (Now, I'm not sure if anyone really eats the jalapeno.  I tried to convince my wife to eat it because it was grilled, I assumed the heat would be less intense.  But I cut into the pepper and it was raw inside.  Good thing she didn't eat it, because I'd be paying for it now).  Both meals came with unlimited steak fries.  I'm generally not a steak fry fan, but they were alright.  They were hot, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, and well seasoned. The kitchen must have switched our burger patties, because my meat had no sign of pink, and my wife's was pink.  The problem with my wife's is that she cut the burger in half to inspect prior to eating, and it looked fine.  She only realized that it was pink after a few bites in... which leads to to believe the burger wasn't cooked evenly.   My burger was extremely disappointing.  The first thing I noticed was the shape.  It was extremely flat and just unattractive.  For a +$10 burger, I was hoping to be wowed a little bit.  The onion strings were extremely chewy, possibly over fried.  The mushrooms had no flavor of horseradish.  It was a tiny burger.  I would definitely give this burger a 4 out of 10. According to my wife, her burger was ""just ok"".  It had nice heat, and the fried jalapeno rings inside the burger were a nice touch.  She gives her burger a 6 out of 10.  That being said, she didn't finish her burger due to the doneness.  We told the waitress about the pink in the burger, just so she knew.  But because 3/4 of the burger had been eaten, there wasn't anything she could do (or wanted to do about it).   She offered us dessert but by that time we were ready to get out of there.  I think it's safe to say we won't be going back there any time soon.  I'm glad we tried it, but for the money, go a couple blocks down to Burger Barge, or go to Kaydee Kat's in the Heights. In all, for two drinks, two burgers, and an onion ring appetizer, our check came to $34.18 without tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-east-peoria?start=20
