Erin R.,"Granite City, IL",16,3,2,3.0,8/6/2017,"This was our first time trying Red Robin. All we knew about it was unlimited fries and heard burgers are good.  Started out by ordering 2 Gueniss 22oz draft beers. I immediately noticed that they have a drink called Absolutely Absolut Freckled Lemonade. I located the waitress right away to change my drink order. This was not difficult because they weren't busy because out visit was in between lunch and dinner. Waitress was very nice and said the switch was no problem at all.   Drinks arrived shortly after ordering. The Freckled Lemonade is amazing and I highly recommend it.  But the Guinness was only a 16oz and as you see above we ordered 22oz. My husband didn't mind just the 22oz and didn't say anything.   Food was subpar and nothing special. Unlimited fries, felt like we were begging for more. They give you about 6-8 fries with your meal. When asking for more, waitress brought 10-15 more for the 4 of us to split.  While waiting for the bill I noticed the tablet on the table and looked at the bill. Couldn't believe that we were charged for the bigger beer and $1.99 entertainment fee.   Overall I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. It's basically Applebees with ""unlimited fries"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edwardsville
Doc H.,"Edwardsville, IL",0,18,20,2.0,12/27/2017,"We've been here a number of times and, for the most part, enjoyed the food and drinks. A good alternative to some of the other restaurants in Edwardsville without a lengthy wait. A bit overpriced for what you get. This was the first time we've ordered online. I was disappointed with the portions in the carryout order. My clucks and Fries had 4 clucks and 9 fries.... Disappointing considering you get bottomless fries if you dine in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edwardsville
Sara W.,"Maryville, IL",51,130,308,5.0,5/6/2017,"Just finished eating and it was good.  Of course the milkshake is to die for.  Tonight however, the fries weren't the best, they needed to be cooked a bit longer.  I hate limp fries! Eww. The onion rings were awesome as was my chicken sandwich.  Little guy enjoyed the pizza.  The ladies restroom needed attention, it was a mess!  We had a nice dinner and I love the photos on the ceiling. Just finished lunch and food and service was on point!  Excellent all around.  I love the southern charm burger!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edwardsville
Susan Y.,"South Side, Chicago, IL",166,18,18,5.0,7/10/2017,"This place is pretty good in terms of service.  I had a server that helped answered every question that I had in mind. I thought Red Robin was fast food, but it isn't really, and so I ordered food since I was dying in starvation.  My boyfriend and I started with drinks & appetizers, we got something like ' bacon fries ' and in terms of drinks, we got ' strawberry lemonade( their special )  & lemonade itself '   The drink tasted heavenly and it was really refreshing. Not only did the drinks taste fantastic, our server went beyond my expectations.  I'm really bad at stories but like, our Dinka were able to be refilled & our server refilled our drinks without us asking. A few minutes later, she brought another one knowing we were going to finish the one we refilled. Bomb service at that point.  Our food came, we ordered burgers! We ordered a bacon cheeseburger & a mac and cheese burger, they were really good & you get to choose sides! We got fries & mac and cheese as our sides. After we got our food, the manager I think came to our table to ask about food and asked how it was, obviously said it was good! :)  A few moments later, our server comes and ask if we want anything else in addition to what we ordered. We added a side and we got it within moments!  Service was really good, so was our food! Thanks for serving us, we will def be back!  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edwardsville

Courtney F.,"Glen Carbon, IL",95,49,13,2.0,8/7/2017,You can get a better burger at many other places in town for a cheaper price. The menu In general is over priced.

Albie S.,"Troy, IL",25,3,,3.0,2/18/2017,We went here to celebrate a birthday.  I'll start with the good.... The food is exactly what you expect from Red Robin and we weren't disappointed.  The place was a disaster and on the verge of disgusting.  It was like a baby had ate at every table or there was a food fight across the entire restaurant.... and no one had cleaned it. Bathrooms were somehow worse.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edwardsville
Stephen H.,"Troy, IL",0,22,17,4.0,1/30/2017,I can't believe that we haven't been to a Red Robin in over a year. Having a toddler limits your food choices. We decided to try this location and we were not disappointed. We started with pretzel bites and cheese. I don't know what it is about these pretzels but they have a beer flavored coating on them that pairs nicely with the cheese dip.  For my main I ordered the Billion Dollar Burger. It was one of the featured burger. The burger was sublime with a potato cake and melty cheese... What's not to love. Of course you can't forget the steak fries. Our server Seth did a great job of keeping our drinks full even though the place was busy. What gave this trip a 4 Star for me was the manager personally coming to our table to apologize that our food was taking longer than the normal due to a cook not showing up to work. I really appreciated him personally apologizing for the wait. This is why I will be coming back to this Red Robin in the near future.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edwardsville
Danny B.,"Maryville, IL",77,232,106,1.0,4/23/2015,"Since its the closest RR... and the kids typically like RR, we decided to give it another try after the bad experience last summer.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised to say things haven't changed. The place was maybe 1/5 full, pretty slow when we got there. We were on a tight time frame and all knew what we wanted, so sat down, ordered everything. It took awhile to get our food. The manager was barking at the employees that he needed 'runners'.. well, we could see our order sitting in the window for a good 10 minutes before it was brought to us. Why didn't the manager take it himself (like any decent manager) instead of yelling at his workers to take it to a table that wasn't theirs?  The fries: Soggy, as usual. As soon as the meals arrived, the fries were cold and soggy so we asked for a basket of 'well done' fries. Guess what? They never came. We changed it up from burgers and went with chicken sandwiches. The chicken was cold and rubbery, WAY overcooked. Towards the end we asked for our check and a couple of boxes because everything had taken so long, and we had somewhere to be.. The waitress then went and took orders from two more tables, didn't come back for another 15 minutes, at that point everyone was in the car ready to go.. so I boxed up the two meals for the kids and left a decent tip for the bad service, considering.. One saving grace was the short stack of onion rings, pretty good, but I guess hard to screw up. I must have eaten at 10 different RR's around the country, I don't know why this one is consistently horrible both in service and food quality. Something needs to change.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edwardsville
Daniel M.,"Highland, IL",0,4,,4.0,7/5/2017,"After a bad meal there three years ago I had sworn off this restaurant, but a friend wanted to try their burgers so we had lunch there.

Aaron A.,"Granite City, IL",122,160,,3.0,4/12/2016,"Red Robin is a treat I don't always get because my girlfriend has sworn off of it for life. I, however, tend to really enjoy the place. Absence makes the heart fonder I suppose. They do have a good selection of burgers. I haven't been disappointed with any that I've tried, and the Black and Blue Cheese is my favorite. They also have some good extras like bottomless fries (Their house seasoning is pretty good too), monster milk shakes for the ice cream lovers, flavored tea/lemonade, and onion rings with a killer sweet bbq sauce.

Melissa P.,"Greenville, IL",34,84,109,3.0,3/7/2016,Went here for lunch today.  It had been a long time since I had been there and I was a bit disappointed.  The menu is really pricey. $14 for an average cheeseburger is more than I want to pay. We did get pretzel bites with beer cheese that were pretty good.  Service was ok but really with the little computer screen on the table they don't have much to do. You can order your drinks and food and then you can even pay your check. They also don't tell you there is a fee to play the games on the computer.

Mike P.,"Edwardsville, IL",47,19,,1.0,10/6/2015,"Dined in tonight and had terrible slow service. Waitress said that they no longer would bring fries out to start with, unlike like they used to. New terminals on table for games, but they seem to want you to use them for everything.  Had to use it to call waitress to order dessert. Waited 20 minutes to get another order of the ""endless"" fries. Prices went up also. Had to use the terminal on the table to pay the bill. It automatically added 20% tip to the bill.  You have to manually change it to make it a different tip amount. Asked to speak to a manager and all she could say was, ""sorry we're understaffed "".

I've been here a few times in the past, and all times were decent. The last two times I was in there I received excellent service from bartender Brad! He's actually the first server from Red Robin to actually ask me if I wanted more fries (usually I would have to ask the server many times for a fries refill).

However, as they say ""the more it changes, the more it stays the same."" The part that earned them the three star's, where their variety of appetizer's. If you want to keep on paying for your selection, long after it is been eat, I would suggest The Full Tower of Onion Rings; with extra house dipping sauce. But, if this is not your style, there are plenty of variety to choose from. Their burger's were very dry and over cooked on the flame thrower. It was only 8:00pm, so still too early to give you an adequate report of their bar activity, but judging by the heavily stocked selves (as you can see in my picture), they are ready for an entire platoon to stop by and pay them a visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edwardsville?start=20

I told her that I wanted my burger medium rare, my boyfriend proceeded with medium.  After about 20 minutes I told him that I knew they were going to be overcooked,  and when they arrived they were. I opted to eat my fries only,  but she insisted that she could fix it.  Alas,  the 2nd burger came back almost as well done as the first one was.  I found it sad that a place that is known for the burgers couldn't make a burger cooked to order medium rare and medium.

Rachel D.,"Granite City, IL",0,6,,2.0,1/17/2016,"We love Red Robin normally, but last night was a different experience. We had a server who was a little busy. She said she'd be right with us, and then took the order of a big table. I get that. However, then she left to go put the order in. Five or so minutes later a hostess came to get a drink order. Wouldn't it make sense to finish taking their order, take our drink order quickly and then run back to get what you need? So after about 15 minutes we get our drinks and order. While waiting a ridiculously long time for our food, endless fries are brought to our table, including sweet potato fries, which we said didn't belong to us. The food runner left all the regular fries on the table. When our server came back over, she knew they had mixed up the table, took the fries off our table, and gave them to the large table she had.

Jacob C.,"Glen Carbon, IL",5,5,1,1.0,4/10/2013,"We attempted to eat at this Red Robin location on Friday. I was looking forward to watching the Cardinal game while enjoying a burger and bottomless fries with my family. However, after being seated and waiting for over 5 minutes (yes I even used the stopwatch app on my phone) we still hadn't seen a single server. It would be understandable (though not entirely excusable) if they had been busy, but we were one of maybe 4 or 5 tables in the entire dining area. At that point, we got up and went to the St Louis Bread Co next door (which was great btw).  Understanding that employees get breaks, it did not help to see a group of 5 employees hanging out on the patio as we left. After placing our order at Bread Co, I walked back over to talk to the manager of RR (Jim) to tell him of the atrocious LACK of service, and that we would not be back for quite a while (if ever). It had been some time since we had tried Red Robin, due to receiving poor service in the past.

Cherie O.,"Saint Louis, MO",111,371,117,2.0,12/5/2011,"I've been on the quest for an awesome burger in St. Louis, and Red Robin is definitely not it.  Burgers are greasy and slimy and just totally fall apart when you try to eat them. The patty is super thin and they load up the sauce pretty thickly, which is probably why the burgers fall apart. The fries are your regular kind of fries, and the sweet potato fries are marginally better, but not the amazing ones that I have come to crave from other places in St. Louis. Personally, I think Five Guys burgers are more ""gourmet"" than Red Robin's...honestly, what has the world come to where you can throw different ingredients together that you usually wouldn't think of for a burger and call it gourmet?? I order something different every time, and I still have yet to find something on the menu that I like.  Our waitress was sort of absent-minded and ditzy, in a nice way. She had maybe four tables, including us. She forgot the utensils and napkins and asked us if she had brought the check to us already (she had). She didn't bother bussing the table either, and I think the manager or the assistant manager actually did that for her.

Amy C.,"Greenville, IL",17,10,,4.0,5/12/2012,Love the appetizers and burgers plus the bottomless fries. You can't beat that.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edwardsville?start=40
jessica H.,"Edwardsville, IL",5,35,11,3.0,1/16/2010,"Red Robin is easy.  I'm not a burger and fries kind of girl, but, it makes my kids happy and I can give them a handful of quarters to play with and grab myself a drink and maybe even a conversation. Now, if I were a french fry girl, these would be tops on my list.  They are so salty and yummy.  But, I try not to partake in this fried finger food, as hard as that is to do.  I've heard great things about the burgers, although, I'm not sure why they can't offer anything less than ""medium"" (does that say something about the quality of their meat?)    Happily, they do have enough healthy options that I don't find it difficult to eat here.  The Chicken sandwich with pineapple is a great option.  I also enjoy the chicken and rice bowl and a few of the salads.   As far as the mega-American burger joints go, this is the best in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edwardsville?start=40
Judy C.,"Edwardsville, IL",0,12,,2.0,5/20/2012,"Food is tasty, if pricey.  We typically avoid Red Robin because of ever-present groups with screaming children, who think it's ok to let their children scream because other parents are letting their children scream.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edwardsville?start=40
Andrea D.,"Wood River, IL",1,23,1,3.0,4/10/2012,"My husband and daughter LOVE Red Robin.  I think it's decent, but not my favorite.  It seems like every time I fall in love with a burger there, they get rid of it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edwardsville?start=40
