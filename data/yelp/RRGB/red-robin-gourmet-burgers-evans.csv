Lori E.,"Athens, GA",4,64,1,4.0,9/25/2017,Great service on this Monday afternoon. My fries were not real hot but great tasting. We all liked our burgers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evans
Spencer V.,"Thomson, GA",45,246,1304,5.0,7/4/2017,"This place is absolutely fantastic. Me and my boyfriend came here for his late birthday dinner last Saturday and we were able to get a good seat. Our waitress Shea, was very polite and well mannered and made us feel right at home We ordered the towering onion rings, burgers, and we ordered the newest dessert on the menu. It was a red,white and blue ice cream cake and it was awesome. This will definitely be one of the regular spots to go to in Augusta and we'll definitely be coming back. Keep up the awesome work. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evans
Chris S.,"Evans, GA",0,3,1,1.0,11/16/2017,"What a colossal disappointment. Ate here last night with a party of six for a birthday. Everybody in a good mood, having a beer, looking forward to a great burger. I ordered the black and blue, and when asked how I replied ""medium rare"". I was told that my two options were ""some pink"" or ""no pink"". I told her ""as pink as I can get it - medium rare"". Similar orders were placed around the table, with one exception.   My burger came out burnt, no pink at all, super well done. As did the others at the table.  This was a birthday celebration, and I did not want to be the one to make a scene, so I choked down my burnt burger. If I pay $15 for a hamburger, and you ask me how I want it, why do you have to give it to me ""your way""?  I can get a better burger at Cracker Barrel - very didsapointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evans
Kevin G.,"Alexandria, VA",5,148,236,5.0,11/11/2016,"Hey it's Veteran's Day and the meal is free so I'm indulging.  Honestly it's the bottomless steak fries that get me more than the burger. It always a great atmosphere and even better when it's mostly Veterans and especially listening to Vietnam and Korean War Veterans tell their stories they are my heroes.  It's a great place to eat and hang out, but my five stars is for today's company.

J E.,"Augusta, GA",3,10,1,2.0,10/13/2017,"Do you like getting ripped off?  Because Red Robin will help you with that. Almost every item on the menu is marked up like 30% more than its worth. I ordered a bowl of chili for about $5.80, and basically received the amount any other restaurant would put in a ""cup"".  It seems like somebody designed the chili dish to look fancy, but then used the cheapest quality meat possible while still charging a premium.  Then, for some reason, they covered it in tortilla strips which, turns out, make no sense in chili.  So this is quality and quantity comparable to Wendy's chili for twice the cost.

Carolyn H.,"Omaha, AR",4,28,,3.0,10/8/2017,"Sunday evening at about five went for Burgers and bottomless fries, it was raining out stepped in greeted instantly but Floors are super slippery I had on rubber soles.Server was good better than most I have encountered while visiting.

Cory W.,"Charlotte, NC",177,216,269,2.0,9/7/2016,"Stopped in here for dinner to grab some burgers and the bottomless fries and had a less than stellar experience. We were seated immediately as the place was almost empty on a Monday night. After waiting for 10 minutes or so, we were finally greeted by our waitress, which I thought was a customer as she had been sitting at the table next to us talking to some customers since we had walked in. She came over and put in our drink orders and then went to sit back down at the table next to us for another 20 minutes chatting.  Finally someone decides to bring our food out to the table, whooo. I ordered the southern charm burger and my date ordered the new mac and cheese burger with garlic and herb fries. The first note was the fries were cold, and the garlic and herb fries had no garlic or herbs on them - just a tiny bit of cheese. After requesting more fries 2 more times, we finally got a hot batch. The southern charm burger was good and about what is expected. The mac and cheese burger tasted fine but was tiny, so I wouldn't suggest getting it unless you just want a snack or are a child. All in all our experience could have been much better with better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evans

B J.,"Capitol Hill, Seattle, WA",80,505,3281,3.0,6/7/2016,Ambience. B Service. A Food. B Price. A Hostess was nice helping with the door and sitting quickly at table. The chairs were dirty with sticky drinks and table had leftover food hidden between menu.  Not the cleanest table.   Server was nice introducing and accommodating and checking back frequently.  Flaky fish and crispy battered fish and chips.  Bottomless all you can eat fries and I substituted for ice berg lettuce. Ask for green leaf. I used as wraps around the fish.  The burger was really good cooked nice pink medium well. Good flavors of the beef and fresh veggies.  Bottomless fries and salad or other options. The fries could come out hotter.

Allie S.,"Evans, GA",112,1,,2.0,11/10/2017,"Rarely leave reviews but I felt so uncomfortable eating here today. Me and a friend went and waiting to be greeted by a host for at least 10 min and were never greeted so we saw spots open at the bar and at a lot of restaurants bar is first come first serve. Alex the bartender was extremely welcoming and sweet. She gave us menus and silverware and got our drink order all within the first 2 minutes of sitting down. Then, her manager (Im guessing) came up and standing right next to us is talking to Alex about us pointing at us and it's making it very obvious she's talking about us then as she walks away she said ""well Im not going to get in trouble because of them""... then Alex ask me and my friend if we are 21, and we tell her that yes we are and that we heard them talking about us. Alex apologized for that. Then the other girl rudely comes up to ask asking if we are ""even 21""?? We explain yes and tell her we will show ID if need be and we have already been asked this. The girl continues being rude telling us that we aren't supposed to sit here.  We apologized saying we didn't know but the entire time eating we felt so unwelcomed and felt like that girl was still talking about us, considering she kept walking by and starring at us as if we were doing something wrong by eating at this restaurant...

After speaking with her I wanted to come back and today I did. We ordered the Cluck and shrimp meal and the Pig Out Burger...both were AWESOME! The fries were fresh and we'll seasoned. The chicken tenders and shrimp were crispy but not overcooked. Most importantly, the burger was perfect. Well cooked, crispy bacon and all around awesome.  Great customer service this time around!

Paul F.,"North Augusta, SC",33,362,84,2.0,2/23/2016,"First time back since the restaurant has been renovated.  I don't really like the renovations to be honest the restaurant feels closed in and claustrophobic.  Think it was better how it used to be as it used to feel spacious and more open. Burger took for ever to come out, felt like the people that came in after me got their burger before me.  My burger was actually cold.  Hardly any one in there for a Thursday evening. Extra order of fries did come out pretty quick like right on top of getting my burger which I find not normal for this restaurant.  This is why I order my extra fries straight away as it normally takes 30 minutes or so to get more. This is the best bit though.  They were actually out of Ketchup.  A burger restaurant without ketchup - that's like a bar without beer.   When I inquired about it I was told the manager had forgotten to order it !!  What's that about ?!

David W.,"Augusta, GA",7,105,15,4.0,5/25/2017,"It has been a few years since we have eaten here. Haven't been since 5 guys and Farmhaus opened in Augusta. My wife had a craving for it, and we decided to go. We had multiple problems. We had 4 orders. All 4 were incorrect when brought to the table. The worst was we specified none of the seasoning on one of the fries ordered, due to allergies. It had seasoning. Other problems;  they put bacon on a vegetarian burger. They did not put guacamole on the wedge sandwich. They put about 1/8 of an avocado on an avocado salad (a 11$ salad). They brought plain fries out when it was garlic fries ordered. They brought fries on another order, when it was broccoli ordered- instead of fries. We asked to see the manager. They never showed up. We called the restaurant later and the manager blamed the waitress. I updated the review from 1 star to 4 stars after the Manager gave us a new order no charge. Everything was correct the second time.

Jessica K.,"Augusta, GA",366,1203,1284,3.0,1/10/2014,"This is a place to bring your kids and drown out their shots with the other families for sure. I never noticed how loud it could be until I came in with a migraine and some bad sensitivity to light. I probably stuck out with all the families and young couples but I missed the strawberry lemonades and fries.  I notice each time I come into a Red Robins, some sort of change is made to the menu, the servers schpeel, the plates or adult beverage menu. For a corporate place, it's not very consistent at all. I come here for a blue cheese burger about once a month and I've noticed in the past months, there's a lot more veggies and less cheese and meat. It's $11 for a 1/4 lb. burger that gets cooked through basically the same kind of mechanism the pizzas as Costco are. Kinda makes me rethink my burger restaurant choice.

Lady N.,"Decatur, GA",8,149,135,1.0,7/11/2016,"Horrible inattentive service. Horrible Food. Never will eat here again. I ordered the bleu ribbon burger and you can tell from the inside of the sandwich picture that a lot of elements were missing. It wasn't worth sending back to the kitchen a third time. The last thing anyone wants to do is piss off the cook. Ate as much of it as I could before completely giving up on it. Most of it ended up to the side in a discarded napkin. Look at the texture and thickness of the bun. Very poor quality. Looks old and tasted stale. Bottomless fries were nothing to write home about. Just regular steak fries with hardly any taste and seasoning that keep coming. That would be nice if I didn't have to beg for more. I didn't experience bottomless anything. And I didn't even get a drink refill. She practically took my initial order, disappeared, came and brought my food, and then disappeared again until it was time for me to get my check. Took forever to get my food and then it was very unappetizing when it arrived. I am not happy with the service nor quality of what I received. My burger was even cold. I should have paid attention to the negative reviews. They are telling the truth. Apparently, I'm not the only one that had issues with barely there service. Check out the so called steak fries. It looks like I was served chipped pieces that they scraped up. I see the commercials all the time and couldn't wait to try this place. I wasted my money. Never will I ever darken these doorsteps again. Red Robin is just a bunch of hype. Don't waste your time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evans?start=20

My brother suggested this place for our birthday since it was one of our favorite places to eat and receive a great meal, were we ever so wrong. This place has changed the menu so drastically and some of my favorite things are not on the menu anymore. The once amazing Avo-Cobb salad has changed and this is one of the reasons why I loved this restaurant. Instead of a large bowl, they now place the salad on a plate. This was so messy because the salad would not stay on the plate while eating it. The salad is half the size and a lot of the things that was once in the salad have been omitted. The lettuce has also changed it's now Romaine lettuce instead of Iceberg lettuce. I'm fine with that but my mother hated this change!!!! The bar wings are still the same and pretty good. I told my family we will have to stop coming here for the salad and eat the burgers again. I hope they don't change them. Red Robin please go back to the last salad formula because this one sucks!!!

I used to go to a Red Robin when I was younger and was expecting more.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evans?start=40
Amanda-Isabelle K.,"Grovetown, GA",10,19,13,4.0,5/5/2015,We were seated right away and recieved our apps fairly quickly. There was a long hair on our food which the food runner quickly noticed. A replacement was immediately brought out! I enjoyed my gluten free bun for my royal robin burger which was delicious. I also ordered a margarita which was equally as good. Overall I will definitely come back just for the gluten safe items on the menu.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evans?start=40
Joel C.,"Evans, GA",49,101,331,3.0,2/17/2015,"It's a very good burger joint for a chain restaurant.  So if you can't make it downtown to someplace better, and you're in the mood for a solid cheeseburger in a loud environment (good for kids), this will scratch the itch.  I enjoy their fries with the Red Robin seasoning sprinkled on top, and I've always had good experiences going bunless with their burgers.  The service has always been friendly, though we've been forgotten about on a few occasions when things get busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evans?start=40
Stephanie H.,"Severna Park, MD",34,9,2,2.0,2/12/2016,It was a good place but now they are more concerned with portion control. The kids meals are both more expensive & have less food. If a kid orders spaghetti or Mac n cheese they will not get much. Not worth going to since the remodeling.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evans?start=40
Chris D.,"Lithonia, GA",0,3,,2.0,7/3/2015,Would have loved to rate the food but after 45 minutes waiting for service decided to leave instead. Tried to get a manager but the hostesses said they would bring one but decided to continue to chat and clean the glass on the front door instead.

Louise M.,"North Augusta, SC",3,34,9,3.0,12/28/2013,"I'm not a huge burger fan so I ordered the crispy chicken salad and seafood scatter. The salad was AMAZING! I almost ordered a second one. The honey mustard sauce was really good, and they weren't stingy with the bacon bits.  The seafood scatter was okay. The clam strips and shrimp were my favorite but the fish was nothing special. Maybe because I'm not used to the taste of cod.  I was too full from the salad to really enjoy the fries but they're pretty good. I ordered a merry moscato punch and it was really strong. I was not a fan. I barely tasted any mango. It took about 20 minutes for our order to be taken and I spent more time waiting than eating. With that said, I'd totally come here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evans?start=40
Joey Y.,"Grovetown, GA",18,43,40,4.0,4/12/2015,"This is a good place to get a good burger. I'm not going to rave about the burgers because, well it's a burger duh, but if you like variety when it comes to your burgers then this is the place for you. I had the Royal Red Robin it came with cheese,tomato,lettuce, bacon and a fried egg to top it off and all the fries you can eat. That meal alone with a drink will run you about $13.00 including tax. So yes it's a little pricey for a burger restaurant, but in all fairness this is a upscale burger restaurant if there is such a thing. The meat was cooked perfectly and the burger was good. The fries were pretty good as well. So over all not a bad meal. If you are watching your waist line this is not the place for you. There is no light items on the menu at all, yes they do have salads, but they are all loaded with calories. The service was good. We were greeted at the door and shown to a table. Our server was very polite, attentive and kept our glasses full. The restaurant was clean and odor free, bad odors anyway that is, the smell of the food wasn't bad as it filled the restaurant. The only reason I gave them four out of five stars was this and I know I'm being picky, but it did bother me and that was that the menus were sticky. If someone had taken the time to wipe down the menus I would have given them five stars. Let's face it when it comes to Hamburg type restaurants this is pretty fancy, but you will pay for that fancy stuff in the way of higher priced burgers, but hey sometimes you just want to be in a fancy atmosphere while eating a burger. Give them a try if you are in the area I don't think you'll be disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evans?start=40

Janina M.,"Harlem, GA",5,39,100,4.0,7/5/2011,"This was my first time eating at a Red Robin. The Whiskey River BBQ Burger: The bun was light and fluffy, the vegetables were fresh, and the fried onions on the bottom were crispy. The burger was cooked perfectly to my liking, and the drinks and fries were plentiful. Bottomless fries, and freckled lemonade made for one full tummy! The onion ring appetizer was HUGE, and easily satisfied the 3 of us. The staff at this Red Robin on Washington Road were super friendly and courteous, and our drinks were refilled VERY swiftly. It's certainly a good buy for your money, and a safe bet for those who only want to be slightly adventurous. Haha! :D After all, how can you go wrong with burgers? I enjoyed this first trip to Red Robin, and I certainly want to return to try their other interesting concoctions. Specifically the teriyaki burger, and bbq chicken wrap, along with their sweet potato fries. All of them looked good. I've posted a video on Youtube documenting my experience, and of course the food.

Mr. T.,"Santa Clarita, CA",386,121,11,3.0,5/8/2011,"I am always reluctant to go to Red Robin, I've been to a few around the U.S. and their food is usually ""eehhh"" and their commercials annoy the crap out of me. Gave it a shot today with my son since Fatz Cafe was backed up. The people there are nice and its a very family orientated atmosphere. I ordered the Guac Burger with an extra paddy (they use the term ""Monster"" size it). The burger wasn't bad, but it was tasteless. If i'm going to chow down on something that's going to pollute my body, I want it to taste like its my last meal. Needless to say, get your burgers elsewhere. Pros: - Great place to bring your children, they give out balloons and crayons to draw with (in my sons case it was their walls) - Service is friendly and quick Cons: - Burgers are not so great, go to Fatz Cafe if you want a good burger - The balloon popping is a little jarring for veterans",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evans?start=40
Russ G.,"Decatur, GA",29,276,,2.0,9/24/2012,"This weekend the lady and I, with chirren in tow, went to Augusta for the day. On the way down we all agreed on a really good burger for lunch so I scanned my phone to see what would come up nearby where we were headed. A few choice places as well as a bunch of junk came up, but Red Robin stood out as we've never eaten at one and all agree the advertising does seem to encourage trying them out.  Got there right at 11am as they opened, quickly greeted and seated by a very enthusiastic hostess. This confused me for a sec as I thought the place was a regular fast food joint, not a sit down and order type of place. I quickly noticed the full bar but was reminded it was Sunday, no sales until 12:30. Dammit.  Scanned the menu, decided quick, and ordered. Food came out a little slower than I would assumed, there was already a crowd inside but nothing a big place couldn't get through, but it was hot and ready to eat, albeit a little displeasing. For all their hype, the burger was a letdown, cooked right (medium) but charred to death outside, and small. The bun suggested a big, thick piece of meat but inside there was a little filet of meat, not much bigger than a burger from a lesser place (Wendy's, King, McD) and just lacking flavor. The fries were soggy too, good sized order but unappetizing. I ate it all and got full but was really disappointed in the experience, especially when the bill came. For $8 Fuddrucker's BLOWS them away by miles, as does virtually any other place around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evans?start=60
Sheila T.,"Evans, GA",0,6,5,1.0,1/3/2015,"For all the people on here giving this restr a 5 star rating:  You must not eat out very often.  I cant imagine what you could possibly be comparing this burger to.  My husband and I ate here last night and were VERY disappointed, to say the least.  Red Robin is a total rip off!   For an appetizer, we ordered the Chili Con Queso & chips.  $7.00 bucks for a small bowel of cheese that was served in the same little bowl that most resturants serve a vegetable like corn or green beans in.   Save your money on this one, get it at the Monterys Mexican restr for same price with better chips and served in a HUGE bowl!!   My husband ordered the Smoke and Pepper Burger, which according to advertisement is a HUGE , tasty, flavorful burger....for about $13.50.  What came out was a totally tasteless (except of the pepper bacon), VERY small patty on a whole lotta bun!! I ordered the bacon cheese burger for 9.99, and decided to upgrade my patty to the Black Angus patty..which costs me an additional 3.50. I knew there would be an obvious upgrade charge, but with the waitress would have warned me it was 3.50 because there was absolutely NO difference in this patty and the normal patty on my husband's burger.  So for 13.50 I got the same small, tastless patty.   They must not season their meat, because all I could taste was the mayo, cheese and bacon ..which was the only thing saving this pitiful burger. The ""bottomless fries"" were soggy and boring and tasted like they mixed fresh ones with cold ones because some of the fries were cold and some were warm.  All the fries needed to be cooked a few mins longer!!   If you want a lot of fries, go to 5Guys Burgers! This place is waay over priced for a tiny burger.  For 2 burgers, 1- iced tea, 1- water and cheese dip....my bill was  $40.00!!   You can get a burger at a number of other places in town that blow this one away.  Save your money!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evans?start=60
David C.,"Augusta, GA",56,475,93,3.0,9/18/2013,This is the first time I have been back to red robin in a while and I was disappointed. We were warmly greated and quickly seated. I got the a1 peppercorn burger and my gf got the blue ribbon burger. They were busy but we got our food in a reasonable amount of time.  We both ordered the burgers a little pink and they were cooked correctly. The burgers tasted good but having been gone for over a year it is noticeable that the patties they use are smaller despite over a dollar price hike. The fries are now served in something that resembles a napkin holder. I dont like it because the holder is just in the way. You cant season nor add ketchup to the fries in it. Just plop the fries on the plate so I can season them and put ketchup on them. Forget the the gimmick already.Then there were the fries. Some were cold and tasted either reheated or been sitting for a long time. I asked for a fresh basket of fries and it was brought fairly quickly. They were piping hot but they just didnt taste good. Overall the atmosphere and service was ok.. the burgers were good but the fries were bad and the patties small for the price being paid.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evans?start=60
Pieter H.,"Orlando, FL",74,30,4,4.0,1/29/2013,"Had my first ever trip here a couple days ago, and I suppose I was pleasantly surprised having the preconceived notion that  this was just a regular fast food burger joint. It is certainly not, with a full liquor bar and varied menu, I was instantly impressed considering my very low expectations. Had I gone to this place thinking it was a full regular restaurant, it is entirely possible that I would have been disappointed, but I didn't and I wasn't and here we are with a positive review. It was much busier than I expected, however, we had no problem getting a seat at the bar right away. This man waits for no one! Though the bar tender looked a little weeded and a bit slow to take care of us, we still got our drinks and orders in without too much hassle. Decent drink selection and average beer selection. I had myself a pint of Guiness as I watched sports on the TV above the bar as I waited for our orders to arrive. I can't remember the name of my burger but it had a killer horseradish sauce on it that sealed the deal for me! The burger was cooked perfectly, albeit, a little too greasy for my liking. They also offered broccoli as an alternative to fries which is a big plus for me! I feel bad enough eating at a place like this, so it was mitigated by the fact that healthy alternatives were available. The fries I tried were nothing special, and I was truly horrified how the gentlemen next to me had a HUGE burger and full plate of fries, and still managed without any problem to get through another two dishes of their ""bottomless"" fries. The man was clearly determined to eat himself into an early heart attack. Aside from the man vs food show going on next to me, it was overall a pleasurable experience.
