David J C.,"Everett, WA",73,129,95,5.0,11/26/2017,"This review is based on our take out experience that we do almost on a weekly basis. First off, Red Robin's has a pretty easy to use online take out order system. This allows us to come in, get our favorite food, and eat it in a more calm and comfortable place. I say that because sometimes you want the Red Robin food, but not the busy and loud atmosphere that it often has. Because it is takeout, we haven't had much interactions with the servers, but for the most part they seem active in their work and friendly. As for food, I wouldn't steer far from what they are known for- burgers. The classic gourmet is what they are known for, and possibly their only real home run as for 5 star food.  I've noticed they can be pretty skimpy with the sauces and fries, so don't be afraid to ask for more. We love this place-more for its takeout and classic gourmet, and will definitely return for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett
Rebecca P.,"Seattle, WA",241,761,96,4.0,11/25/2017,"I had never been to a Red Robin before I moved to the PNW, and I was pleasantly surprised by the food and service. I think there's something a little weird about being called ""honey"" but a server, but there's also something weirdly nice about it, too. And the burger -- damn, yum! And I even got the chicken version of Madlove and felt that way. As for the fries, they were pretty good, too, though I will say they need about 3x the garlic. (I ordered the garlic fries.) Bottom line: Why 2.5 stars? The servers here are great and burgers yum.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett
Crystal T.,"Seattle, WA",9,57,81,1.0,10/9/2017,"Came here tonight for a friend's birthday and waited 20 minutes at our table before we were able to flag someone down just to order drinks and starters. Another 5 minutes passed and the waiter finally came to take our order. We decided to get drinks, appetizers, and entrees at the same time, because it was already getting late. Tonight's service was extremely poor. This was the first time I've been back in about 3 years. I think this will be the last time. One star, because that's the lowest Yelp will allow, and because the ladies at the front were helpful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett
Cassie K.,"The Colony, TX",66,7,,1.0,1/4/2018,"Are here over the weekend with my husband. I ordered a sandwich and he got a burger. Both items had lettuce. I took two bites of my sandwich and something tasted off. The kitchen manager was very rude and assured me everything was cooked to kill bacteria. I advised him bacteria exists on produce which is not cooked and he rolled his eyes at me. Three days later, we are both exhibiting symptoms of e. Coli, for which there is currently an outbreak in lettuce. His symptoms are markedly worse than mine because he ate his whole sandwich. 0/10 will ever eat at Red Robin again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett
Connie L.,"Olympia, WA",10,1,,1.0,12/20/2017,Went to Everett Red Robin today.  The meal was gross............egg on burger was burned and side of apples was not any good period.  Staff is not well educated on jobs.  Very poor service.............very poor management.......they would not do anything about the poor food.  I will never go to Red Robin again.

Michelle V.,"Seattle, WA",2939,929,879,5.0,2/16/2017,"I've dined at many Red Robin restaurants in my day and this location has got to have the fastest and friendliest service! If you're like me, the only reason why you hit up a RR is for the bottomless fries, right? Well, here at this location if: 1. You want a refill of fries? Coming right up, literally within a couple minutes.  2. You want some more campfire sauce for your fries, sure thing! Literally the next time you look up, your waitress or one of her fellow waitstaff is already setting your request on your table. 3. You want another beer or drink, no worries...sit at the bar area and you'll still receive the super fast service!  And you actually don't have to order a burger in order to get their bottomless fries deal. Just order any of their $7-$9 appetizers and you're golden! I was all potato'd out that night...however, as I'm writing this review, my mouth is already watering for more steak fry goodness at Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett

I went back to talk to a Manager. A very unprofessional guy showed up with the name of WILLY. claimed himself as a Resturant Manager. I explained him the situation and also told him to verify with the servers that we were here but he refused to do anything and said its too bad.

Tami H.,"Kirkland, WA",42,428,9,1.0,8/21/2016,"Really horrible location of Red Robin.  Avoid it at all costs. It's dirty, not a nice location. Service is horrible.  I asked twice for an allergy menu and finally looked it up online as the server kept forgetting to bring it.  He brought the wrong drinks for the kids.  Then he forgot to put in one of our hamburger orders so we waited forever.  To top it off, the manager or supervisor came by to ask how things were going... I told her we still were missing an entrée and she acted as if it was my fault!  Once she finally realized that no one put in the order, she came over to apologize, but really it's not acceptable to blame the customer for poor service!  Everyone was just really unfriendly and unhelpful.   At least they comped us for that entrée! Food was average at best.  There are better Red Robins out there. BTW, the new interactive screens they put at the table are not a good idea.  I don't think we should be training our kids to play video games during a meal and by having it so front and center, it just creates friction if you don't want your kid to use it.  There are better ways to keep kids engaged at the dinner table!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett
Karan S.,"Marysville, WA",3,61,28,1.0,11/20/2017,"The worst red robin I have ever been to. Came here on Tuesday around 8PM. Was not busy at all. Took the front greeter almost ten minutes to seat two of us. Once seated (to the right of the entrance area they have a dining area that's less attractive then McDonald's dining area. It's right next to the kitchen.) The waitress took almost 10 minutes to get our drink orders which at that point we decided to put our dinner orders in as well since we didn't want a long wait again. She took our orders and I specifically stated NO PINK in my burger. Another 15 minutes go by, drinks have been empty for close to 5 minutes and she comes out with the food. My friends fish and chips were burnt. I took 2 bites of my burger and it was PINK. Not even a little bit but completely PINK. I ate my fries and we waited for her to come back. I told her the burger was pink and she took it to the back,  manager came out and asked if I would like a reorder of the burger I said no she asked if I'd like something else I said sure chicken Caesar wrap to go. The manager was going to comp the meal and obviously since she asked and wanted to remedy the situation the wrap to go as well. The waitress comes back to ring us out and took a measly $5 off the total!! Horrible service and horrible food. Won't be back here and won't refer anyone to visit this RR location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett
Sery K.,"Bellevue, WA",66,23,6,2.0,4/30/2017,"With two kids that are 6 & 3 1/2, over the years we've learned our lesson to not go on any family lunches or dinners, maybe only once in awhile. Well today our boys decided to behave themselves (wait, what?!  there is a higher power!!!) My husband and I thought, 'Omg, we finally get to sit down and enjoy our lunch, for once!' Well we were wrong; despite our boys' best behavior (okay, maybe a little bit of scolding to put the fear of momma bear in them) we received really bad service  Waters were not brought to us; had to ask twice. Bottomless fries were forgotten, twice.  I surveyed the restaurant, it wasnt busy, so I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe they were short staffed, or the BOH/kitchen was short. Our server was pregnant so I did sympathize and had empathy for her but my hubby's burger he ordered, was NOT the one he ordered. He doesnt like to complain so he just ate it  By the time we really wanted to leave the fries finally came out, service today sucked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett

Nikki H.,"Everett, WA",24,11,,3.0,5/29/2017,"I'll start by saying usually the food is good and service decent. Tonight was an exception. The pretzel bites were highly over cooked. Nearly burnt. The salad was underwhelming. I ordered the bbq chicken salad which comes with Baja veggies, lime and garlic bread. The salad was a thin layer of green leaves. Some small cut tomatoes and chicken with a little bit bbq sauce. All the items that make the bbq salad unique were.missing. no baba veggies, no lime, no garlic bread.... my husband is uncomfortable with complaining so I just ate it and left disappointed.   Yelp is my outlet.

Heather J.,"Mountlake Terrace, WA",193,643,282,3.0,11/17/2015,"This place was super crowded on a recent Friday night visit. The parking lot was full and people were standing everywhere waiting for tables. I tried to avoid this and sit in the bar, only to find a table with one seat and another chair off to the side. I moved the seat to the table and was quickly told this was a 1 seat table due to the blocking of the aisle way. The design of this part of the bar section seems very poorly laid out. It appears this location is in the midway process of some remodeling and looks pretty awful at present.  I got seated quicker than the quoted wait for the main dining area and had my beverages super fast, but it took forever for the food to come. The whole section I was sitting in was people with beverages only who waited a long time for food. It appeared many of the servers were standing in the kitchen area waiting for their food orders to come up. The table next to us was lucky enough to get some fries ahead of time, but we had not realized this was something we should request in advance. Food eventually came and was delicious.  I love the customizability of the food here. I am huge fan of the nutrition calculator on the website. I was hoping to have this kind of maneuverability on the new table machines, but seems you can only order appetizers, desserts and drinks from this. I was also disturbed to learn that the machine offers games which could have helped me pass the very long wait, but they require an additional charge of 1.99$ which is then added to your bill. It seems very easy to click on this and end up paying which I am sure could upset some parents with curious children. I did appreciate it had a few free features, the ability to join the rewards program and a faster way to pay.  A manager was nice enough to stop by and apologize for the wait on more than one occasion. I also was able to get 2 refills of broccoli which can be exchanged for the never ending fries. Our server was highly attentive and made sure we had a lot of refills and also kept us informed on the wait. I love that you can sub a boca burger to any sandwich here and will continue to frequent but may wait til the remodel is completed and its less hectic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett
Brad G.,"Everett, WA",33,18,10,1.0,11/15/2016,"Since the remodel and menu revision, this specific Red Robin is just sluggish an a drab. The server was super nice, but incredibly way too busy. She tried her best, but her section was way to big...causing her to not allow for enough attention to be devoted to each table.  We were sat a table that still needed to wiped off, so we were loved to another table. The food came out incredibly slow, the appetizer came out after the 3 of the 4 entrees...the 4th enter came out after the 3 were eaten 3/4....so I didn't get to enjoy my food with the company I came with. We actually had to call the manager over to inform her that the salad was less the edible. She did take it off the bill, to sum it up.  I don't think I'll be coming back...which is a major BUMMER, cause we loved this place. :-(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett
Dan C.,"Everett, WA",1,14,,2.0,2/28/2017,"Been dining at Red Robin for years. Food in Everett is still good, but couple of real turn-offs: Ziosk's on tables, and service. We quit eating at Red Robin a couple years back when Ziosk's were first introduced. Tried them again, and they are still the center-piece on all tables. First Ziosk's. Who wants to go out for lunch or dinner, and have a tablet in the middle of the table pushing advertising and games? Very distracting when having a conversation, so we just place it face down on the table.  The Ziosk's also have a microphone and camera. How does Red Robin use audio and video from tables? Lastly, we had to pay using the Ziosk. Apple Pay did not work, nor did the chip reader, so we had to use the mag strip/swipe method. Really unsecure. I wonder when a hack or skim will take place. Second, wait staff pretty underwhelming. There were a group of them near our table having a great conversation with each other, at the expense of paying customers. Will give them a try in another couple of years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett
Trista H.,"Everett, WA",40,376,2729,3.0,12/27/2015,"RR is undergoing quite a few renovations. I assume the face lift is due to the surrounding competing restaurants such as Bob's Burgers and Brews, NYP Grill and Buffalo Wild Wings. Tablets have been placed on every table. The tablets can essentially take all personal interaction out of the equation if that is what one prefers. Notifying the server, placing orders, paying tabs and playing games (for a fee) can all be done through these. It's still disappointing that RR doesn't offer a happy hour. Because of this, I will always choose to dine and drink at the above establishments.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett
Jes B.,"Everett, WA",41,8,2,1.0,3/3/2017,"Ridiculous wait time for any parties over 4 people. We had 1st asked for a table for 5. We had 4 people that needed to sit & an infant that was being held the whole time. They said it would be a 20 min. wait & then we said to the front lady that it was actually only 4. They took in 4 different groups of 4 people before we were seated. Then when we were we were put in a booth that hardly fit 4 people & was right acrossed from the people that were seated right before us & they arrived at the restaurant 20 mins after us. We waited 40 mins. total. It was obviously poorly manage up front & when We had asked about the wait they had looked clueless & said you'll be next, they are cleaning the table now. That was said before they took in a bunch of groups before us. Then I wasn't impressed with the food at all. It was all half par. The waiter was the onky good thing there. He was nice & a tentative.

Danni L.,"Spokane, WA",0,13,4,5.0,8/6/2014,"Gluten free was truly kept GF, thank you! My allergy is a severe one so I appreciate the care. When I asked for a GF menu, our server surprised me with an iPad allowing me to explore my options (and they had so many more options than most restaurants!). I was thrilled at the thought of having fries. GF fries! Oh baby, that was going to be my entree. No other place I've been to makes their fries separately from the gluten contaminated foods.  In fact, I was so eager that I opted for the ""lettuce bun"" for my sandwich instead of the GF bun just so I could have room for bottomless fries :)  (No pic of the food. I dove in too fast and don't touch my ph once I start eating) Aside from the delightful fries which were perfectly hot and crisp, I had the California chicken sandwich.  A wonderful side.  The chicken was juicy, the bacon was thick and cooked to that just-right mid-range of a little crispy and a little soft. The iceberg lettuce was stacked a bit thickly but was easy enough to peel away to my preference.  Our visit was a Sat nite and the place was packed but we had no problem getting an immediate seat in the bar section. And prompt service! Our server was great (sorry I'm poor with names). He was friendly and checked on us frequently. That was especially nice given the busy-ness of the night. The sign of good staffing? I think so! Our drinks were nummy too.  I had a type of berry margarita and my friend had a summer beer that she liked enough to order again ;)  Next time I'm in town I'll gladly revisit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=60

Our server was nice and caring. We ordered two burgers and it took about 35 minutes to get to us. When we finally got our food, it was cold and over cooked. The patties were burnt too. You only get about five fries with your meal as well. So if you're a Fri person, you're gonna have to order more. The refills aren't free anymore, they charge you each time. Then while eating , we kept having different people survey us on the food and the restaurant. We waited all this time for our meal and when we finally get it, we kept getting interrupted to be asked questions. We finally finish and are about to leave until one of the managers pops up out of no where to ask us MORE questions.

Ashleigh G.,"Virginia Beach, VA",37,43,220,4.0,5/26/2014,"This is my go to spot before seeing a movie, and on several other occasions because of a recent addition to there menu: The Smoke & Pepper Burger, it's simply amazing. It has bacon,cheese, lettuce, and pickles in addition to its 1/2 lb angus beef patty. Priced around $14 it's definitely more than I typically pay for a burger but well worth it. I add grilled onions to mine and ask for an extra sauce (it comes with it's own sauce on the side, not sure what it is but MAKES this burger). So since this discovery I have purposefully come here just to get my burger fix, I actually find myself luring others in to coming with me so they can share in my new discovery.

They took the chili away and brought me another. Halfway through me eating this chili, I found a square plastic bread bag tie. I was so grossed out and both of us felt sick after the food. Will never come here again. They did however comp our meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=60
Gail D.,"Everett, WA",0,3,,1.0,10/21/2016,"My husband and I went here (Everett Red Robin) for years and it was consistently good but in the last year something has happened.  Service is horrible, food takes forever and 90% of the time food is cold.  Thought we'd try it again last night just hoping something had changed for the better....but nope.  Horrible.  Runny warm milkshake brought after we received our lukewarm meal.  French fries were cold so we asked for some hot ones.  Guess what? We finally got them served by a runner while we were paying our bill.  Huge disappointment!  We have been apologized to by a manager so many times saying sorry they are understaffed that evening but they are ALWAYS understaffed now.  Don't waste your time here.  Go to the Smokey Point Red Robin.  The atmosphere and food are never a problem and great service too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=60

Every time we got walked to a table the table is sticky, there is sauce and food all over the seats, and the floor is disgusting. This time before we left I asked to speak with a manager. I told her that she needed a customers outside review on this place. I told her exactly what I just said earlier and she said she just fired the last busser and hired a new one but maybe she should have kept the other one too! I am just a little shocked because what was going to be our waitress agreed that it was disgusting and so did the manager but yet I don't see any of them doing anything about it. If you know as a manager your restaurant is gross then why don't you pick up a broom or mop... Why is it Everytime we go in there it gets worse?

Morgan J.,"Washington, DC",0,20,,4.0,7/8/2015,"Went here this weekend (the 4th) with my parents. My mom and I both ordered a Nacho Tavern burger without a bun. The burgers came out with no bun, but no nacho sauce or anything ""nacho-ey"" about them. Mine had pepper jack cheese, my mom's did not. They also don't put tavern sauce on it if you don't get a bun, but we didn't know that.  After letting the waitress know, she apologized and the manager came over and righted the mistake. It was great to not be made to feel guilty for not getting what we ordered! We were treated very well and will definitely be back to this location after the experience.

Kristi H.,"Edmonds, WA",48,197,7,3.0,4/1/2013,"2.5 stars would probably be a better indicator because our experience was largely meh but another customer there made it good :) We came on Easter Sunday with our 4 kids. I expected crowds but it was empty. We were seated promptly but the extra flap they lifted at the end to make room for the high chair was tilted. In fact, both our tables had a tilt and we spent most the meal trying to catch crayons, toy cars (the baby doesn't go anywhere without his Lightning McQueen and Mater car) and even drinks and food from careening off their edges.  Our waiter was distracted and distant. He did not clear empty cups off the table even after bringing refills. Thus our table cluttered up immediately, especially since a wide swath had to be cleared in front of the toddler to avoid messes. We ordered onion rings and fried zucchini to keep the kids happy until their meals arrived. Both were undercooked, particularly the zucchini which was very crunchy. The onion ring batter was good, but the onion itself was really thick and hard to chew. Our food came and it was meh. I think we might have been spoiled by Blazing Onion. I had the Blu Ribbon burger. It was ok, but bun was untoasted (pet peeve) and the onion strings were underdone resulting in a shoelace like texture and appearance with every bite. Bleh. Husband's burger was mediocre as well. Two kids had pizza, two had chicken strips. Chicken seemed fine, but the pizza was abysmal. Cheese was super thick and not hot enough.  There was an elderly couple sitting behind us and we exchanged some kind words with them during the meal. They paid for us (not cheap to pay for 6!) and we were so touched. Its what made this kind of icky meal a great experience. Thanks anonymous elderly couple!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=80

I frequent the Lynnwood location as I always have incredible service (and they will be receiving a great review after this). I have never had a good experience here, but today was the worst experience.  We were told the wait would be 10-15 min, after 40 we got our table. It took another 20 to put our orders in and once our food came out some time later (understandable for the wait) we only got half our food. Once the other half arrived, half the table was done eating and the fresh food wasn't hot. One of the dishes was incorrect which delayed it even more and caused their food to sit and get cold while waiting for a new bottom bun. We also never received refills until we were done eating... For a Wednesday night and an arrival time of 5:45, I just didn't expect it to take so long. Our party was an average size of 4 adults and 2 kids. I understand that restaurants can get short staffed, but when there is cold food, longer waits than we were told and zero times we were followed up on until the end, it's just not a good experience for anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=80

Michael H.,"Lynnwood, WA",0,10,,1.0,8/2/2015,"I have nothing good or bad to say about this restaurant in general, typical joint that features ten dollar cheeseburgers. This location, however... I had been to this place twice before in the year since I moved to this area. After the second time I decided not to return. Today I decided to give them another shot, my sister was in town and she usually enjoys their food. This was a typical day at this location, which isn't good news. We were seated in view of the kitchen, and were able to view first hand the reason our burgers came to us room temperature. Both burgers sat under the heat lamp for at least fifteen minutes, probably more. Unappetizing as he'll. To make things worse, when the manager came by at the end to ask how it was, she couldn't accept ""no, just let us pay and get out of here"" as an answer, despite the fact I kept repeating it OVER AND OVER. She just prattled on ENDLESSLY with stuff like ""I can have them make another, maybe a different burger would be more to your liking"" and what have you. The only reason I told her in the first place was to be a nice guy, but now my patience was growing thin. Told her I needed to go (yet again). Now she starts asking me what I had to do that day after I left. I kid you not. I had more than enough at that point, told her that I didn't know what I was doing later, but it would be better than this. PLEASE GO. That pretty much sums up my trip to red robin today, do yourself a favor and drive over to the alderwood or Smokey point location if somebody else's ten dollar cheeseburger won't do. I also wanted to add that it wasn't that busy at all (go figure), it was the beginning of the day, about an hour or so after they open.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=80

Courtney W.,"Everett, WA",28,2,,1.0,3/9/2015,"I went for a quick burger and bottomless fries on a Saturday night around 7pm. I knew that coming in it would be pretty busy but that I could always sit in the bar with my friend. We found a table behind the bar really quickly, I figured we were really lucky.  We ordered drinks first, I wanted to try a new drink a Pear-tini they advertised, I thought I would step out of my usual drink for once and try something new. The drink came quickly but tasted nothing like pear, can't quiet put a finger on it but it wasn't for me and hey that is what I get for trying a new drink. I asked if I could order my regular vodka, redbull. When that arrived it tasted like mint, (funny thing when I asked for a different drink after the pear-tini the waitress asked if it tasted minty) I didn't want to be a jerk and just figured I would deal with it.  Then we ordered food, gourmet cheddar cheese burger, NO PICKLES, and the garlic fries with seasoning. My friend ordered onion rings and a double tavern (nacho). Food came out and My burger had onion rings, and pickles, and my buddies had regular fries. The waiter that came to bring us food I told them that the rings were hers and asked if I could get the garlic fries I ordered. He said sure. Then another waiter came by about 20 min later and I caught her attention and asked for the fries, she said of course shed get them ordered right now. Then our regular waitress came by and I asked about my fries and she said she would check, and ended up reordering them. We finished our food, we waited about another 30 min after we finished our food, no fries yet. I asked for my check.  SO food was wrong, drink was crap, and never got fries...

Last night we went there and although she didn't order it, they were still out of avocado. We also heard the waitress talking and they were out of onion rings, clucks, and cheddar cheese. I can understand running out of product once in awhile but to run out and be out on a continuous basis is outrageous. We asked our waitress about being out of avocado and she told us that they hadn't been able to get it from their vendor. The problem with this is the fact that the same vendor delivers to grocery stores and they have avocados.

I'm sad that this restaurant, which was my families favorite for almost 10 years, but no more. It's become a source of irritation and shock as we've watched it go down hill. Service is the main problem. Always understaffed and you know you're going to have to wait with the crowd in the tiny waiting area for a long time. You get one shot with your waiter so make sure to ask for everything you need in the beginning. They now charge $4.49 for a strawberry lemonade with free refills staff not around for refills. No more garlic fries! They have a garlic seasoning (extra charge). Not the same. Very disappointed. Bacon is cold even though I've tried to ask for it hot or extra crispy. The manager has come across as rude and condescending when we pointed out how long we waited, wrong order, our child's entree came when we were finished...he was so lacking in customer service skills that I could see my children were uncomfortable that I told him I would not accept his offer to discount our bill. The thing I dislike the most is how quickly the wait staff bring you the check. You can expect it to arrive shortly after your entrees. Last week we went for a birthday and guess what? Their free sundae (which we've always enjoyed along with their singing) has been reduced to a small 1/4 cup serving. So disappointed in this Red Robin!

Tom B.,"Mukilteo, WA",745,1348,189,3.0,5/29/2011,"I seem to have some kind of homing beacon built into me lately for Red Robin. I sincerely loved this place when I was in college, because it seemed like a place I could meet relatives close to campus and we could all have a cheap and inoffensive dinner before I turned 21. Found out later that the location where we met was the first one they built. That seemed kinda cool.  Anyway, group meals lately seem to call me home to RR somehow, like I have some kind of burger lo-jack built in somewhere and I can't quite turn it off. So not only did we end up here on a busy Friday night, but I showed up first and secured the table for everybody. Oh, well--more time to try to clear the latest level of Angry Birds to confound me. They were really nice about seating me at a big table even though everyone else was late and I was by myself. The staff is really funny and outgoing here--they're really a good bunch of kids at this location. They were swamped, they had to do that birthday song where they all have to clap and they had a bunch of birthday people to do it for, people were breaking glasses on the floor, and nobody ever seemed to miss a beat.  The food's the same everywhere, kinda like the architecture and decorations. It's a true chain through and through. I ordered a salad which was pretty decent, and big enough that I couldn't finish it. The prices were more than fair; even with a couple drinks it was $60 for 6 people. Sometimes you just have to get a bunch of people fed--if you're the only one there who really gets wound up about good food, it behooves you to keep quiet and enjoy your beer and dinner salad.

But I don't know if they have new staff, or bad management, but my experience was SO bad, that I left zero dollars as tip, spoke to the manager about my issues and still had more issues after that!  #1: When we walked in the door, there was no host waiting to seat us. There's a clear sign that says ""Wait to be seated,"" so we did. No host to be seen. Lots of waiters and other people walked past us in the distance, even gave us eye contact, but no one came over to seat us. We waited almost 5 minutes, and then I got upset and went over to the bar next to the waiting area and loudly asked ""can someone help seat us?"" I was very frustrated. So soon after that, a lady came and sat us down with the manager. The manager made no acknowledgement or apology about the long wait for us to be seated. So I calmly asked him, ""is it customary to make all of your guests wait so long to be seated,"" of which he seemed to be completely in shock that we waited at all. He then apologized for the experience of waiting and offered a free appetizer. He gave us our menus and came back less than a minute later, frantically wanting to take our order. Um....I don't even think I really had time to look at the menu. So we quickly ordered.  #2: I ordered a burger with no shoe string onions (clearly taken by the manager who helped us) and my burger comes out with shoestring onions. I was upset, because the manager took my order wrong! So they took it back and brought me one without the onions and apologized.  #3: We never even got our ""complimentary"" appetizer the manager promised us, until after our meals and I asked where our appetizer was. The waitress who finished serving us (because the manager was no where in site, or apparently had left for the day was gone) looked completely unaware that there was an appetizer at all.  Epic fail Red Robin. Thanks for making us wait to be seated way to long, getting our order wrong (by the manager) and then forgetting all together about our appetizer that you offered as free since we had a bad experience!

The staff at this location are more concerned about texting on there cell phone and talking to the bar staff then assisting guests and providing any type of true service. I dined there in the evening on 4/28 and regret my visit. My order included a Quesadea that had very very little chicken, a ton of mushrooms and unmelted cheese. The unmelted cheese tells me the order was rushed and not correctly cooked. Being it was not a health issue (the chicken was cooked) I just dealt with it. Cherry soda are served with regular coke and cherry flavoring added, but no cherry on top (like at most Red Robins). The staff is not conversational (I sat in the bar section) and did not appear to have a sense of urgency. It is sad because the friendliest person I saw was the manager when he was delivering to go orders to the bar area for pick up. He made great eye contact, smiled, offered me a soda refil promptly and I could tell he cared about his job. The staff put on a show when he was around. If I was this location management, I would review your cameras and see how things are around when there is no manager. Cell phones in plan view (chest level in the hand) will give you an idea of what associates to watch.

Veroni P.,"San Francisco, CA",34,1,,2.0,8/3/2017,The food was ok but the way the waitress was taking our order was kind of misleading. I thought everything came with the already $10 burger but nah everything was extra. Ended up paying almost $60(tip included) just for two people and a baby! Ridiculous. Patties are $3.50 extra? Are you kidding? Sauce is a dollar extra too like wtf. That little thumb sized sauce a whole dollar. I know it's my fault for not asking the price for EVERYTHING but come on. Money grubbin establishment. But of course we had to tip just because we always do. 7 bucks I wish we didn't have because she should have mentioned they were gonna be extra like wtf. Why suggest and not tell us that it would be an add on? The one fuckin time I don't ask the price for everything we end up getting a shit ton extra shit. Rather eat a casino burger than their mediocre Big Mac I could buy at BK. Never had this problem at other burger joints. To be honest I regret coming here.

John B.,"Everett, WA",0,18,1,1.0,3/21/2016,"I think I have finally given up on Red Robin. It's just not good. For the price I'm paying I'll go to one of the other nearby restaurants. I went to RR for lunch yesterday with a friend of mine and his son. My friend's son has life threatening food allergies so when we placed our order he mentioned his allergies and was very clear what he needed to NOT be on his burger. It was also his birthday so he presented his birthday burger coupon to the server and was told she would get it when we were ready to cash out. When our food finally arrived of course there was a big pile of mayo on my friend's son's burger. He reminded our server that he couldn't have that. She was nice and apologetic, and immediately took it back to get a new burger. And then we waited and waited. The manager came out and apologized for the mistake, but made no mention of the time it was taking to get the new burger out. Of course everyone at the table felt bad eating, but our food was getting cold. The burger finally came out - 30 minutes later. No offer to bring the kid more fries while he waited. No offer to comp the onion rings we ordered. No anything.  Finally when we were ready to pay the bill our server forgot to remove the burger for his birthday. And when we tried to cash out with the tablet, it wouldn't let us split the check. We called the server and she couldn't figure it out so she rang everything up on her own. And she didn't get stuff split up correctly, but at this point I didn't even care. I just wanted to get out of there.  The remodel is OK. At least the tables and booths aren't sticky, but I assume given time it will be as dirty and grimy as it was before the remodel. It seems every time I leave a Red Robin I tell myself I'm not going back. And then several months go by and I return and the experience reminds me again that I don't want to come back. It's a sad cycle really. If you want a mid-range burger go to Bob's instead (it's essentially in the same big parking lot). Better service, nicer atmosphere, and you'll pay about the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=40

We went on a Saturday at about 5:15 p.m. We were second in line and the hostess took care of us promptly. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they are Atkins/Fatkins friendly. I ordered the cheeseburger on lettuce with bottomless broccoli. My partner ordered his cheeseburger with a bun and bottomless fries. For my order I asked for butter but ended up using their seasoning at the table to season my broccoli. While waiting for our order I used the Ziosk gizmo at the table to sign up for a Red Robin Royalty membership. If you do not have one make sure you use the Ziosk that's on the table so that your meal is credited for loyalty points. Service by Matthias was on point. I used the Ziosk to ""Call Server"". Two other servers stopped by when they noticed we used the Ziosk on the table to call our server.   We ended up paying at the table with the Ziosk gizmo which is really convenient.

They recently remodeled the inside, got nicer tables, chairs, new wall paper, mobile ordering/entertainment device (I really like this electronic device because you can order refills of drinks or pay your check at any time without calling the waiter over). The food is the same which is average. It really is a hit or miss every time we come here. Some days the food is nice and fresh and crisp, other days are not so good like when we get old soggy fries.

What really got me was when I got my check, am not a Washington resident so I showed my license and also my military ID. She said they don't give military discounts or take off tax for out of staters. Well, for one you have too, the other is a privilege I get that. However, do not tell me red robin don't to veteran discounts because my royalty card they gave me was for all the neat discounts they give service members.

Eric C.,"Westmont, Everett, WA",178,4,,1.0,9/23/2017,"I was going to leave this alone but it keeps eating at me... A month or two ago my wife and I attended this location for a night out (we also had our 8 year old son with us). Our entire experience was less than 1 star worthy. To start they gave our son his menu in Spanish. We do not speak Spanish so my son was unable to play the games on the children's menu or even read the foods that were offered. It was a very long time after being seated before anyone came to check on us while we sat there trying to figure out what the menu items were. When they finally showed up we asked them about the menu and we were told that they only had Spanish kid's menus at the time (which I find very strange). OK we just ordered him something, I can't exactly remember what he got. I ordered the Sriracha Tavern Burger and my wife ordered the Smoky Jack Tavern Burger. After waiting for a very long time to receive our food the server arrives with our food. My son gets his, I get mine, and the server dumps my wife's entire plate on her, ranch and campfire sauce sides and all. OK. We decide to not make a big deal about it and assure the server that it's fine. OK. Server tells us that the good thing about it is that it bumps our order to the number one priority so we won't have to wait an ungodly amount of time for the replacement to arrive. Alright that sounds decent, I wait for my wife's food to arrive and our son starts eating his food. Now it's been about 20 minutes and we have seen multiple tables be served but our food still hasn't arrived. Our son is finished and is getting antsy and my food is now cold. OK. Then they bring my wife her food and how about that, they brought her a Sriracha Tavern Burger (the wrong burger). Alright so at this point we're like whatever I'm very hungry, my food is cold, my son is starting to act up and we are generally unhappy. The restaurant manager was present but never came by to see if we were OK or if we needed anything. Nobody even offered us any sort of compensation for the issues (we were drinking water and weren't even offered a drink upgrade or anything).

Nathan S.,"Marysville, WA",0,7,1,1.0,6/10/2016,"So.....um..........this was the most interesting experience at a Red Robin. Ever. We came at 4:30 and asked if it was happy hour. The server said, ""It's all day happy hour."" To which I got a slightly confused look on my face and said, ""Alright, well is there a happy hour menu or are there specific items that are on special?"" She replied, ""No there are no price differences and it's happy hour all day because our prices are much lower than anywhere else."" I looked at her slightly incredulously and said, ""So you're saying these are the prices and that's it? No differences at any point during the day?"" She smiled and nodded. As if her word painting somehow changed the fact that there IS no happy hour. And that's all I asked for without looking for some kind of workaround to convince me that I'm getting some amazing deal. Which I'm not. Because it's still 15 bucks for a burger. Then I ordered a drink. Mistake number two. (First mistake was asking any questions at all.) When it arrived it was very watery and tasteless. I asked to exchange it when the waitress returned, and she wouldn't even pick up the drink to take it away and instead said these words to me: ""I can't take it off the bill, you will have to pay for it anyway."" My jaw fell, just a little, and I stared at her, and said ""But I don't like it and would like to replace it."" She said ""We can't do that and you'll still have to pay for it."" I stared at her, burst out laughing and said ""Are you serious?"" She, again, smiled and nodded. I.....just..............yeah. Food took fooooorrrreeeeevvvver to come out. Bringing us extra fries or bottomless mac n cheese was probably the most inconvenient part of her day, judging from her face. And heaven forbid we ask for extra sauce with an expectation of NOT having it tossed onto the table. Finally we left without even getting the final part of our order, because why on earth should it take 20 minutes to make a kid's root beer float?

On a positive note, this location knows how to correctly prepare and serve their Ensenada Chicken- something the Twin Lakes location still can't figure out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=20
Angela T.,"San Diego, CA",120,232,542,1.0,1/5/2016,"Disgusted. Ordered teriyaki burger and my burger came out soaked in teriyaki sauce and my bread was so saggy, it tasted like a wet towel in my mouth. The veggies were placed so messy, some bites had lettuce, some bites had chicken, uh what.  The service was good because we self ordered everything on the iPad and all they had to do was bring it out. But we did get our drink refills in as well, so that's the least thing they could do since my food was ruined with over saucing.  I couldn't even finish half of my burger because I basically consumed teriyaki sauce than the actual burger. Definitely didn't want a to-go box.  Overall, I'm never coming to this location again.

Kaia J.,"Seattle, WA",45,1,,1.0,2/19/2017,"I want to start by saying my husband and I go to Red Robin 4-5 times a week. We came to RR the night we got married, for our Christmas dinner before and after my grandma's funeral and so on.  The experience we had in this location today however, will probably reduce our RR visits to 3-4 times a week. Let me tell you why.  First of all, host didn't smile when he greeted us. I could see my husband was visibly upset by this rude greeting we experienced. But we were starving so went in anyway.   We ordered without issues. My husband is allergic to lettuce and tomatoes so we made sure there wouldn't be any in his burger.  Last time we came here I counted 16 fries in my fry holder. Alas, this time I counted 12 fries. I of course was very disappointed by the lack of fries. However my I couldn't help but notice my husband had more fries than I had, and that felt like he was getting special treatment. They put lettuce and tomatoes on my husband's burger but not on mine. Also, they really should maker fries smaller, because I almost choked on a fry. When I told our waitress about my complaint with their fry sizes, she rolled her eyes and said there's nothing she can do about potota sizes. What happened to ""the customer is always right""?   Overall, I am very unsatisfied with my experience today I hope it will be better when we come again in 2 days.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=20
Elena H.,"Bothell, WA",53,45,12,5.0,9/21/2016,"Wow! I was very impressed with the service. We were sat down right away and our waitress came just as fast. She was so great, kind, and fast. I forgot her name but she checked on us often enough but not overbearingly - our drinks came out and she even brought us a basket of fries while we wait for our food. I haven't had a Red Robin do that in a long time. So cool! Definitely helped ease hangriness while waiting for food. :D She kept our drinks filled and us comfortable. My only complaint - which isn't on any waitresses - is the setup of the entire restaurant, it's so open feeling but I saw there were other places a little less ""open"". Just my small thoughts. Anyways, everything else was great, our food came out in a timely manner and our waitress made sure we were still stocked with everything. A manager also came by just to check in on us and that was also very nice.  The employees were all working very hard and moving around and helping each other out really well, which can be hard with some locations where employees often just chat or stand around. This one is great so far and I hope to go back again with other friends (I went with my sister). I recommend this location! Thank you Red Robin for a great experience.

Chris S.,"Everett, WA",142,158,22,2.0,2/23/2017,"My parents moved to WA in the late 60s so my Dad could attend grad school at the UW. They loved it here and decided to stay. One of the things they loved about their time at UW was eating at the original Red Robin on Fuhrman Ave. After he graduated, they moved to the country and weren't able to get back very often so they were delighted when Red Robin expanded and franchised which led to one being built in Federal Way which was a reasonable driving distance from our home. I swear that was the only place they really wanted to go out to dinner when I was a kid. I've never been a big burger fanatic but I did like the Monster Burgers and bottomless steak fries. I also loved the teriyaki chicken sandwich, their wings and the clam chowder.  I moved to Colorado for a couple of years after high school and was happy to find that it had become popular there as well. It was a taste of home and I dragged all my friends there constantly. When I returned to WA and met my wife, our first date was at the East Hill location in Kent. At some point I made the observation that when I ordered refills on my bottomless fries, they usually seemed to come out a bit overcooked. I theorized that this was to discourage hungry young guys such as myself from camping out and binging on fries. One of my buddies voiced that observation to our waiter one night at the old downtown Bellevue location which I believe is now a parking lot. We probably got our drinks spit in but I have no evidence of that.  Their prices kept going up and I was soon paying nearly $10 for the Monster Burger that used to cost me around $6. At that point, I embraced my love of Asian food and took a lengthy break from Red Robin. About 10 years later, I worked in an office in Woodinville that brought in discounted lunch every day from different local restaurants. On Red Robin Day, I ordered the same thing as I had as a teenager, a Monster Burger and fries. One bite and I was hooked again. The prices were over $10 by then but prices had gone up everywhere so it was less of a big deal than when I was a newlywed. Thus followed a five year streak of regular eating and enjoyment of Red Robin. At that point, I noticed a distinct drop in the quality of the food and service. I hung on for a while but after bad service issues at the Lynnwood and Monroe locations that were bad enough that I wrote complaint emails to the company I reevaluated. The waiter in Lynnwood was so rude to our friends and us that I've never been back to that location. The Monroe manager made a great effort to make things right and it was more just carelessness on the part of a server. A good manager does make a difference but I decided to go back on hiatus. We had also had many bad service incidents at the Everett location which is the one closest to where we have lived for the past decade-plus and the food just didn't taste the same anymore and gave me indigestion.  It has been a while since I ate there but the other day, my wife was craving a Mile High Mud Pie. We stopped in for  a quick dinner and by the end of my meal, I reaffirmed that I'm done with this place. The Monster Burgers cost nearly $15 now. I ordered the Seafood Scatter which I always liked but it was about 1/3 the size it was when I was younger and cost $16+. To add insult to injury, the fish was overcooked as well. They never did bring me my coleslaw and when I asked them for a small cup of pickles to eat with my fish, they told me they would have to charge me for a bottle of pickles. Seriously, that actually happened. I had to ask four times for a fry refill, once to the manager who stopped by to ask how our meal was. I had to ask two more times after that and when it came, it was, of course, overcooked and a very small portion. They're really guarding their french fry consumption apparently.  I tell you all this long story to illustrate that I've had a long relationship with this restaurant. My folks started eating there over 40 years ago and I've been eating there for at least 30. You'll never hate anyone or anything more than someone or something you once loved who/that let you down hard. So long Red Robin. In my end of town, I have Bob's Burger and Brew, Blazin' Onion and several other better alternatives now. When I'm in the mood for a burger, I'll take my business to them. At the very least, if you had maintained the quality of your food and service, I could have gutted out the massive increase in price over the years but you didn't so I'm out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=20

My husband couldnt even eat his food. I still feel sick after eating it last night. The only reason why I ate it was because i was starving. Garlic fries were smothered in oil.

She goes away and five minutes later comes back and says ""I'm sorry but my manager says we are unable to serve you a kids meal"". My wife is now embarrassed. We go to Bob's across the parking lot.

Kathie A.,"Edmonds, WA",6,14,,1.0,8/12/2014,"Have never felt under so much pressure to eat and leave! Although we were the 2nd couple in line when it opened at 11:00 AM, we were still seated by the kitchen (maybe because we had a 2 yr. old with us?). When I asked why, she told me this was the only section open. Our server, Ian, came to take our order immediately after we sat down,,,,,again and again and again! I finally  said ""could we look at the menu first?"". I ordered the Banzai burger and he said ""fries, soup or salad""? Since I knew my partner was getting the fries, I ordered the soup. After getting our food I was extremely disappointed in that I couldn't even tell what kind of burger it was; it clearly had pineapple on it but I couldn't taste it and it clearly had cheddar on it but I couldn't taste that either. Don't know if it had teriyaki on it  'cause I couldn't taste or see that either. Ian kept coming over and asking if we were ready for our bill and since we had just started eating I said ""In a bit"", he brought it over anyways and imagine my surprise when I was charged for the soup! When I questioned him about it, he said ""Oh yeah, soup is extra"". Never did he come back to ask how the food was, if we needed a refill or if we wanted dessert. Clearly, this was a man in a hurry. For what I don't know as there were only 2 other tables in his section, (granted one of the tables was quite large) . So now I remember WHY I stopped going to Red Robin 5 years ago (even though they are across the street from where I work). Lousy food and lousy service!

Still, the reason I'm writing this review is the staff. Some pals decided to have a birthday party for their 3 year old here with 30 guests!! Holy cow. I didn't know you could even make a reservation for a group that large at a place that doesn't have private rooms. The staff was amazing. They basically blocked off one section of the restaurant so we could get tables all together. They were about 20 minutes late in seating us because they had to wait for ALL the tables in that section (6 or 7 tables) to finish eating and leave. *smile* Seriously, though, the wait staff was amazing. They brought out some fries immediately (before we ordered) because some of the little kids said they were hungry, on the assumption that at least one person in our group would order a meal with the unlimited fries. Very cool. And the waitress even squirted ketchup on the plate for the 3 year old when the adults nearby had their hands full.

Jen F.,"Everett, WA",28,35,14,1.0,1/15/2016,"This has to be the worst Red Robin I've ever been to. I've been there twice now and both times were umm...pretty bad. The wait times both times were longer than at other Red Robin's. The first time we were stuck in a back corner surrounded by big parties and received lousy service (one of the reasons being our waiter was socializing with some of the patrons). Both times the staff (all of them) seemed disorganized and all over the place. The entrance/waiting area is dirty and there isn't an official check in area. The food was okay the first time. But the 2nd time it was horrible and it took us an HOUR to get our food. My chicken sandwich had maybe a teaspoon of guacamole. The gluten free bun was dry like I was eating sawdust (apparently they use the worst gluten free buns ever...Udi's multi-grain!). The chicken breast was dry and was really small. I managed to flag down our waiter and get some guacamole, so I could try and eat the damn sandwich. My sweet potato fries were cold. My hubby tried one of their new burgers but it was incredibly dry and overcooked. He loved the sauces on it, but it couldn't save the fact he was he eating a hockey puck. The staff kept running around like crazy the whole time we were there and our waiter and a manager apologized for the wait saying it's not usually this busy on a Tuesday. But they didn't comp anything. Even after I complained about my food. There were many tables that sat unclean with napkins and drinks for a long amount of time.

We needed to hurry, ordered an app, the 7 pc. boneless buffalo wings, kind of small in size. Our server, a young blonde guy, who was self-effacing about his weight, was very responsive. Since we had the app, we weren't really hungry so we decided to order an avocado burger with the avocado on the side, no tomato, with the sandwich cut up to split. It seemed a little packed on this Saturday, with others enjoying the VD as we were, food took awhile. The server, sensing our growing frustration at either having to miss the food or the movie, spoke to a manager, who came over and made sure that our food was rushed and brought to us asap. He was standing there when we got our food, which had the tomato on it (I'm alergic), and was not cut... When our server, I think his name was Brian, brought the check, he alerted us that the burger and fries were comped by the manager.  Lunch for $5.65.

I'm totally in love with their Burning Love burger and the endless fries don't hurt, either. Last night we tried the fried zucchini and it was delish... but the batter would probably have stayed on better if they dried the slices a bit before breading. As it was they were a little hard to eat. We usually are there for Happy Hour so we like to sit in the bar where there is typically no waiting (your mileage may vary on Fridays and Weekends) and the staff in the bar area is super attentive. I can't really speak for table service in other areas. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is they (annoyingly) still cater to the birthday song crowd, thus a good time may occasionally be punctuated by off-key singing and screaming children running around; and while that isn't really the fault of staff... it can detract from the atmosphere.  My advice... go late... sit in the bar... and it's all FIVES! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=120

Yesterday was probably our last time there since the food was absolutely terrible,  perfectly matching the service.   It took a very long time for our server to greet us and get our drink order, so long in fact that we were ready to order our meals. We ordered an appetizer to come before the meal,  it arrived 25 minutes later, our meals arrived 30 minutes after that. 4 of the 5 meals arrived but the fifth never came out, we actually had to flag down the server to ask if it was coming,  she told us she needed to put in a new order.  That was my 12 year old sons food so I  shared with him since he only wanted French fries.  His order finally came to the table when we were ready to leave. All the other meals were delivered to the table cold,  without any of the sauces that were ordered, and they looked as if they had been thrown together or dropped and re-plated. The sweet potato fries were burned and hard, not edible. The waitstaff that was assisting our server were totally rude,  yelling back and forth about the table numbers and whose order went to which table, it was very immature and obnoxious.  It was a really unpleasant dining experience.

Tonight we sat down around 7:15 and ordered shortly after. Our server was great, super friendly and attentive, but our food took an hour to get to our table. I'm assuming the kitchen was short staffed or something. I'm a server myself so I know things can happen and it can get backed up in the kitchen and get really chaotic. The biggest thing I was disappointed in was that the manager never made an appearance to any of the tables in our section to apologize or even address the situation. I'm used to management staying on top of these sort of situations and being more present. We had to finally ask to speak to a manager. At this point we were tired of waiting around so we just paid.

The burgers are great, never had a dish I didnt like, for a chain, it isnt bad, not 5 star quality, but a good way to cure your hunger. HOWEVER, the only beef I have is with this location in Everett.  I have only been here a few times and that was enough. The last time I came here with my bf, we saw about 3 different waitresses. Each came to our table, asked us the same questions. Of course this isnt a bad thing, just a mix up, but my god, how rude the employees are here. I dont expect much but at least look me in the eye a few times. Also, when our drinks arrived, about 5 mins later, another waitress also came up with drinks(cokes) but when she realized that we had just received a couple cokes, which were still very full, instead of taking them back, she put them on our table and left them there. So we got to enjoy watching 2 full cokes get watered down on our table, as we drank the ones we already had...we looked  like we were super thirtsy and couldnt wait for a refill, we had to have to refills NOW.  What made up for all that, was the food was still great, so after we ate, we pretty much forgot about the rudeness and the double coke disaster and called it good. When my bf checked his credit statement, the waitress double charged his tip. We gave her 10, and he was charged for 20.  Red Robin still have us as customers, however, not at this location. Considering we havent been here in a while, things might have changed, but I am not going to risk it. Make the trip to Lynnwood.

Rachel W.,"Mukilteo, WA",34,59,26,4.0,12/1/2010,"I usually don't eat much meat, but I have to say, I really enjoy the occassional Red Robin burger. If you go there in the afternoon or a week night it's usually not too crowded, you get your food quickly, and lots of attention from your server. It's basically always a mistake to go on a Friday night; kids crying, running around, and yelling, very busy servers who don't always have time to stop and ask if you need more of anything of fill your water, and overall it just seems to be a meeting place for obnoxious, noisy people. Last time my boyfriend and I made the mistake of going on a Friday night, there was a party of about 12 people sitting right next to us, all women in their early 20's wearing pajamas (weird), screaming every couple of seconds, discussing things loud enough so that the whole place could get the 411, and bouncing on the booth seat that I was also sitting on. Our server was really nice and said she was so sorry that they were so loud, of course it's not Red Robin's fault that they attrack the crazies on weekend nights, though.  The guacamole bacon burger is my favorite, and the garlic fries (extra crispy) are pretty much heaven on earth. The blue cheese burger and the mount olympus burgers are pretty tastey, too.  Only twice have I had issues with the food or service, and if you mention it there they will fix it and appologize, and if you email them they'll call you and appologize and send you a gift card, which is really nice, good service for a chain.  Last time I went I ordered my burger well done and I took one bite and it was BRIGHT pink all throughout the burger, which grosses me out beyond belief, especially since I'm sure they get their hamburger in such huge shipments that it could easily be infected with something... I didn't complain while I was there because I really didn't feel like getting a new burger, I felt more like going to the bathroom and barfing, but I know if I write to them they'll make it right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=160

I have been to the Lynnwood and Northgate locations, and have had such consistantly mediocre food, unattentive service, and an overall bad time that i used to hate Red Robin!! But im telling you this, try out the Everett location. They are what Red Robin should be. You get what you pay for and expect!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=160
Sarah D.,"Seattle, WA",174,975,638,5.0,2/10/2009,"I have to say i agree with the other review. It is an odd thing to feel so impressed by a chain restaurant, but I am seriously addicted. My girlfriends and I go here post/mid study session and the food is always great, the people are always friendly, and best of all they always give me extra pesto sauce :) I get the Bruschetta Chicken Sandwich, sub garden burger, with a side of extra pesto and extra balsamic sauce. There are not enough words for the amazingness of this stuff. If I have a little of the sauces left over I take them home and toss them on steamed veggies....so good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=180
Simon B.,"Mukilteo, WA",0,3,,1.0,9/22/2013,"Food was slow and fries were stale, likely from being out for a while. On top of it all my kids both threw up after they drank the chocolate milk. We voiced our concern over the milk but the manager exhorted that it couldn't be from the milk because ""it takes about 12 hours to have reaction from bad milk."" So he blamed our kids and gave us the bill in full. This was ludicrous but since we already made a scene we paid and left. Will never return here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=180

Matt W.,"Everett, WA",11,4,,3.0,6/11/2011,The fish and chips were really greasy and they left me with a tiny cup half filled with tartar sauce that is very good but had to ask for more and it took them 8 min to bring me some from the kitchen that was less than 15 ft away...  The breading seemed really heavy and greasy.  Not sure I will try that again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=180
Mark W.,"Edmonds, WA",0,6,,5.0,1/23/2013,"My wife, two year old, and I went to dinner on a Monday.  We arrived at 6:30pm and the restaurant was on a 10-15 minute wait.  We were seated in five minutes and out table was clean and well stocked.  Our server Erica was excellent.  She was fast, friendly to my daughter, and made a nice drink recommendation for my wife (the Mai Tai was good).  She took care of all our refills without being asked and had a casual but professional attitude.  The food quality was fantastic; one of the best burgers I can remember.  We will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=180

li j.,"Everett, WA",0,30,,4.0,6/14/2011,still good but dissappointed discontinued 'hard' icecream shakes in favor of bland soft-serve for same price everyone-spec the kids having great time. ice cream desserts shoul not be over $6-yikes! BUT the ONLY burger place to offer a truly FREE birthday buger-very generous given the economy. staff super friendly/attentive and restaraunt nice7cleanthey did not charge extra for thing like grilled onions.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=180
c l.,"Portland, OR",0,10,,1.0,9/6/2012,"Won't ever go back to this Red Robin.  The ranch dressing was watered down and when we received a dessert item that was a baked item, it was frozen which of course made me realize the desserts are frozen and not fresh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=180
S S.,"Everett, WA",1,66,,3.0,9/4/2009,"If you are looking for any of the following, you will love this restaurant: 1) Flair -- Think Office Space. There will be a small army of teens and twenty-somethings with plastic-moulded smiles. They'll speed around singing a clap-happy birthday tune and then get back to delivering bottomless french fries. When you look up the walls are covered in memorabilia--but this is Everett and nothing memorable has every happened here so-- from other places and times.  2) Grease -- The menu isn't much to write home about. The burger is good so they created about twenty versions, none of which fit between your teeth. The aforementioned fries are...fries...heavily salted.  3) Corporate Blandness -- This is the perfect place to bring someone you want to feed but don't want to get to know. With all the kitsch around, you get the sense that personality is meant to be an afterthought. Perfect for blind dates you don't want to go well, Amway presentations, and all things artifice.  4) Secret rating!!!: If you are 18 and have about five bucks (total) you can get full eating bottomless french fries and refills of Shirley Temples here. And with all the cool pictures on the wall and young wait staff you will be in heaven.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=180
