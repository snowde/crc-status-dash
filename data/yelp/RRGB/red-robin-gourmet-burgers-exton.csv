Taryn P.,"Stafford, TX",0,13,1,3.0,6/30/2015,"Food was good. Our waitress was wonderful. The trouble came when paying the check. We had a party of 9. We had to use the kiosk at the table to pay. We used a gift card but needed to add an extra payment of $11 to leave an appropriate tip.. The kiosk wouldn't let us use additional payment. The manager said the only way we could pay the additional money for tip was to buy something off the menu and open a new check. My husband had to ""buy"" beans to pay the rest of her tip and never actually got the beans so we paid an extra $1 just to leave the tip which didn't go towards the tip... So frustrating. And our waitress said if they don't have the customers pay through the kiosk they get in trouble and are given a bad section to take care of. Just frustrating and ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton?start=40
Susan C.,"Chester Springs, PA",2,17,,1.0,4/27/2013,"Three strikes, you're out. I have never had a good visit at this location and I have tried several times. Last night, I went with the family and ordered the apple chicken salad. The chicken was not moist or juicy and 3/4 of the salad was the yellow part of the lettuce. Go to Panera Bread for a better salad with a better price.The garlic bread was fine and the service was fine.  My first visit several years ago was a disappointment. I ordered the fish sandwich and it came with two pieces of fish; one was fine, the other was like rubber and not edible. Maybe it had been warmed up or was cooked twice. I will not be returning to the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton?start=40
Adam A.,"Downingtown, PA",2,62,,4.0,3/1/2014,Red Robin is a fun place to go.  If you get anything other than burgers here you're nuts!  Their burgers are soooo good!

F C.,"Downingtown, PA",0,5,,2.0,11/9/2014,"Not a great experience. No minors allowed to sit in bar area with parents, in violation of PA LCB state rules. So basically they are discriminating on basis of age. No different than if they did so on basis of race or disability, like if they only let certain races or unhandicapped people in bar area, so we have a civil rights violation on our hands. Idiot manager was misinformed but didn't much care anyway. Perhaps the ACLU should file suit, or if you are a shark lawyer reading this and want to shake down RR and its deep pockets for easy big $ settlement, go ahead look into it. Local news station might get good story out of that too. Anyway, burgers and service were sort of OK but nobody's heart was in it.

Service is about what you'd expect from a chain restaurant.  Sometimes it's great, and sometimes it's not.  It just depends.  In general, I don't hold them to much, so I'm never really let down.    Good for lunch, or a quick meal before a movie.  Or with the kids.  Unless you have a raging headache.  In which case, get a sitter and go someplace quiet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton?start=40

Yeah, that was the overwhelmingly disappointing feeling I had here at this particular Red Robin. The service was pretty bad as well. The server wasn't attentive at all. I normally like Red Robin far more than other chains, but this one is just like all the other bad chain restaurants.

Tim K.,"Cary, NC",0,13,,3.0,2/13/2013,"I have been to a couple of different Red Robins throughout the country and this one unfortunately is not quite to the caliber of some of the others I have tried. Not necessarily bad but the burger buns have been a little cold and hard and the burgers themselves did not seem to be as juicy as other stores. Fries, in one case, were a little dried out and not really hot when I got them. Service have been overall good.

Undercova A.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,392,178,1.0,2/21/2011,"I had a bad feeling about this place, but it was late and everything else was closed, closing, or a noisy bar which we were not up to.  The decor looks like a 4 year old's dream come true.  The menu and table had a certain stickiness to them.  My entree was simple enough: an ""Apple Harvest Salad.""  Sounds appealing, no?  Well it was absolutely disgusting.  The chicken was clearly a frozen patty that had been warmed up in a microwave and then lightly seared on the grill.  It was tough and had no taste whatsoever.  I literally took one bite and pushed it aside.  The ""salad"" was the stuff you buy in bulk at BJ's or Costco.  Nothing more than iceberg lettuce.  As if that wasn't insulting enough, the tough whitish core of the lettuce was nestled right under the chicken.  My H's sandwich (Prime Rib Dip) was slightly better, then again, he was starving.  I thought it was tough too.  The fries were the only saving grace, but they were only slightly warm.  Ugh.  Stay away.  I wish I could give ZERO stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton?start=40

Matthew T.,"Collegeville, PA",0,14,,2.0,6/4/2013,"Seated quickly, and was fascinated by these new electronic ordering devices on the tables. So when the waiter came over, I asked him how they worked, and what I could use them for throughout the course of our meal. He told me I could order drinks, and appetizers and deserts, and pay the bill. So he actually took the first drink order. When he came back with the drinks from the bar, I asked him if we could place an appetizer, to which he responded, ""yeah, right on the computer at the table."" Which meant to me, I don't want to do my job so use this. After placing the appetizer order through the computer, he proceeded to gather with other staff behind the bar and talk. Never coming over to ask how we were doing. After ordering the main courses through him, because apparently you cannot order the main dish on the tableside computer, we never saw him again. He and his ""buddy"" got behind the bar and started singing together, as if I am not trying to enjoy my meal. Needless to say, they seem to be pretty happy getting replaced by a computerized system, I am sure though he wasn't happy with his tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton?start=40

Joe C.,"Phoenixville, PA",86,189,1,2.0,1/7/2017,"I haven't been to a Red Robin in ages but since I got a $5.00 coupon in the mail, I figured what better time. Although they have some fairly ambitious burger offerings I went with one of my tried-and-trues, the mushroom and swiss. No complaints whatsoever about the burger; it tasted great, the mushrooms were fresh not canned, and the meat was cooked to my medium rare specifications.  My issue is that unless you have a coupon I don't think their offerings provide good value for the prices; honestly, I feel like even with my coupon, the value is questionable given these are only single burgers.  The all-you-can-eat fries is idiotic, in my opinion, and seems like a way to compensate.  Who the hell is going to want third or even second portions of fries?  I actually opted for broccoli instead of fries.  Maybe I should've had the fries because the broccoli was rubbery and wilted.

My colleague had a birthday ""free burger"" coupon which she wanted to use instead on a milkshake and the staff here made it happen. But aside from that, the rest of the food is abysmal. The french onion soup I had was so incredibly salty that I thought my blood pressure would skyrocket just from the amount of sodium - it was undrinkable. The table kiosks they have for checkout failed to print out a paper receipt for me and I needed one for my business trip reimbursement.

Michele S.,"Endicott, NY",29,1,,1.0,7/23/2017,"Attended a team dinner. Yes, there were over 40 of us and the coach made reservations. The room off to the bar was ready for our group but for some reason the hostess was now ready to seat us. The lobby was filling up and a severe thunderstorm was on the way. Thank goodness our coach was proactive telling the hostess it would be a good idea to seat our group soon as the guests could not all fit in the lobby. Then the rain came, a downpour and the ceiling began to leak everywhere. Water was pouring out from the bar and dripping on our tables. The staff did nothing but bring out two buckets to catch the rain. We had to strategically move the tables around not to be dripped on. The staff was unphased.  The meal took over an hour to begin being served. The waitresses and waiters did not have a clue. Our coaches served the food. I had to ask for a cloth to clean a table and had to ask for utensils and napkins at the bar. The staff were happy to give the items to me but just not bring it. Both my daughters had incorrect meals. My other daughter's burger was too pink and falling apart. No drink refills were offered. My husbands burger was cold. The meal cost over 70 and was a huge disappointment. We have enjoyed Red Robin at other locations in the past but will be avoiding it from now on.

Douglas K.,"West Chester, PA",2,4,,1.0,6/4/2016,"I have a lot of fond memories from Red Robin in the Pacific Northwest that date back to the last century. So, when my daughter wanted to visit our local Red Robin instead of her Parents' first choice of Uno's it was an easy sell.  Too bad we did not go to Uno's.... Our server took our order and promptly took off.  Dirty dishes and silverware were promptly switched out. The appetizers came and the server promptly took off.  Unfortunately, our entrees promptly came as we were eating the appetizers. All too prompt....  This wasn't a lunch rush.   I ordered my all time favorite- the Royal Burger.  I stopped trying other burgers, because I was always disappointed knowing what I missed out on.  My Royal burger was cold.  It was not piping hot fresh, but absolutely room temperature.  After some debate, I sent it back.  A new one was promptly made and delivered.  It was warm, except the whites of the egg. They did not see much heat in the kitchen because there were some that were still raw.  Besides the problems with my burger, the waiter was completely ambivalent.  He did what he had to do at a minimum for his tip and took off trying to avoid requests from us.   When we left there were three members of the staff at the hostess stand hanging out and talking. Not a one said a word. No ""Thank You"" or ""Good Night"".  Sort of summed up the experience for the evening - take the money while providing the absolute minimum level of service.   Simply put it out if your mind that one of the three opened the door for us when we exited.   I felt sad and let down. My favorite Royal Burger isn't Royal anymore and neither is Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton
Lori R.,"West Chester, PA",21,1,,2.0,10/28/2016,"All of my families prior visits would have been at least four stars. This one was not. The new wait  app failed due to hostess error and then we were seated at one of the tables by the TOGO door. It was a very cold night and although I am glad RR has good business, it was very cold each time they went in and out. We mentioned it to the manager who said that she understood and that they do not use it in the winter for that reason. She said she would have the server use a different door (as they do in the winter). Well either she forgot or he was insubordinate. He never stopped using the side door near our table. The family next to us were also in disbelief as they heard her statement and were also cold.

Joe G.,"Philadelphia, PA",31,13,8,2.0,12/4/2015,"It's funny. You have a certain imagine in your mind about what an experience at a moderately-priced burger joint should be, and as modest as that is, this establishment fails to live up to it. It seems like the entire staff is made up entirely of apathetic college students. I could be wrong. But nonetheless, the apathy expressed by everyone in the restaurant was palpable. Don't expect anyone to really care about your meal. Your server will probably forget silverware. Maybe they will get your order wrong. Who knows. If you want a decent burger, you can probably get it here. Just expect to put up with a lousy staff and a very slow wait time. I came here for lunch with some coworkers and couldn't get out in under two hours. Better give your boss a heads up before coming here unless you always roll back into the office at 2pm.

B E.,"Downingtown, PA",0,7,,1.0,6/24/2015,"Decent food; excruciatingly slow service time and time again. I don't know why I've given this Red Robin as many chances as I have. Every time I have gone I think to myself, ""Well, the service can't be as bad as last time"", and every time I am wrong. For example, last night we went there for dinner. They were moderately busy, but not packed. Our kids' meals came out in a reasonable amount of time, but the food for me and my wife took 45-60 minutes! Just for a burger and a wrap. We asked for tartar sauce for my son's fish. When she eventually brought it, she said, ""oh, I have the tartar sauce here, but I see that he's done."" (Maybe that should be a clue that you took WAY too long to bring it). We also asked for marinara for my daughter's meatballs. Despite stopping by twice to say, ""that marinara will be right up"", the waitress never brought it. My wife asked for a refill of her lemonade. Then the kids ordered dessert, got it, ate their sundaes, my wife and I finished or meals, and we paid at the kiosk. About 30 minutes had passed, and still no lemonade.  As we were getting up to leave, the waitress appeared with the lemonade and said, ""Oh, do you want me to put this in a to go cup?"" I've been to this Red Robin 5 or 6 times in the past few months, and only once was the service ""not ridiculously bad"". It's a shame, I like the food, but I don't think I can stand to give them another chance.

Foods good but ordered my burger medium and got it burnt more than well done and got a half empty can of fries on the side. For the prices I expected a little more than fast food expierence.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton?start=20
Steve S.,"Glenolden, PA",334,945,282,3.0,1/7/2012,"I've always kind of liked this chain, and this coming from a guy who has a bit of a disdain for chain restaurants at times.  I don't know that I would call their food the best, but they do have some things about them I appreciate.   For instance, the bottomless fries are a good touch.  Even though I don't often take advantage of the deal, it's good to know that if I demand more fries with my burger, I get more fries with no questions asked.   Actually, they tend to ask you if you want more before you get around to it.  I am a fan of their steakhouse style of fries as well.  If you like big thick fries, you'll be OK with these.   Getting a free burger and sundae on your birthday through their e-mail club makes the  cheapskate in me happy, and was the reason for my visit here.  Nothing like getting a full on gourmet burger with guacamole, cheese, onion, and bacon, bottomless fries, ice cream, and unlimited refills on iced tea, and having the bill come back at $2.63.  Even if it is for one day, it's a nice thing.  Otherwise that combo is over 14 bucks, which is par for the course for what you get.   Quality of the burger is on the decent end of the spectrum.  Maybe not the absolute best around.  But they have enough creative combinations to keep me interested.  They have a more expansive menu than the burgers, though I haven't tried much else in my Red Robin history of several visits to the chain.   Atmosphere is very chainy.  Kids will like it though.  I liked staring at pictures of blown up old tobacco baseball cards on the wall at the bar while eating my burger.  Sure it's contrived.  But it's OK.  Service was prompt, but I came on a slow day.  Everyone here was very friendly though.  Very good touch.   All in all, I say it's not bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton?start=20
Nan G.,"Elverson, PA",19,3,,1.0,2/13/2016,"I only give it one star. We were seated but we waited about twenty minutes or so for our waitress to take our drink order, then another ten or so for her to come back with our drinks. At this point we were thinking our meal will probably take forever and it did. Our food was served with no napkins and silverware. Our fingers were dripping with cheese and grease and we had to wait some more until we could flag someone down. My plate was spotted. Can't say anything more negative. Just don't go a Friday night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton?start=20
Megan W.,"Phoenixville, PA",0,2,,1.0,1/30/2016,"While I can understand a 30 min wait, I can not understand a 40+ min wait on top of that for food. Our server hasn't even checked in with us since taking our order. There is no way anything on this menu can make up for such poor service. Such a shame because this used to be a quality place to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton?start=20
Bud B.,"Louisville, KY",6,50,3,1.0,9/28/2013,Wow. That's all I can say.  No service. Literally.  Seated promptly. On the patio. 10 minutes later no one stopped at my table. Only 2 other tables occupied. A server stood within 5 feet of me 3 times without a word.  Asked to see the manager. Explained what had happened. To his credit he offered to make it right by buying my lunch. But seriously. It's a Red Robin and it was already bad. Avoid.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton?start=20
Dan B.,"Berwyn, PA",0,10,,1.0,1/8/2016,"So ... the food is OK. The server could not have been more pleasant. The price was reasonable. BUT they charge you $2 to use a machine at the table!?? My son used it for a couple of minutes. It was NEVER made clear that there was a charge to use this (which I also used to pay my bill, btw). Upon leaving I expressed my dissatisfaction at the front desk and they offered to ""take it off the bill"". Keep the money dudes ... but you will never see me there again. And, you can be sure I'll tell as many people as I know to stay clear of this place. What a scam.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton?start=20

Frank D.,"Pottstown, PA",1,7,,1.0,10/7/2014,Don't come at 4 pm.   There was no help to meet us at the check in counter.

Gibbs F.,"Middletown, NJ",0,116,36,2.0,8/28/2014,"The onion rings were fine.  The fried clams and burger was fine.  The fries were not seasoned, and the chicken sandwich was tasteless except for the onion and mayo.  The fried chicken salad - I get it all the time and this was the worst one.  It was okay, but the chicken was dry and there was less egg, cheese and bacon than ever before.  Disappointing.  Made us wish we'd have stopped somewhere else.  The waitress was very nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton?start=20
Kaitlin M.,"Lakewood, CA",130,9,,2.0,9/4/2015,Not a huge fan! Coming from a serving background being sat in a section where employees are taking a break and yelling at each other across the restaurant is not ok!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton?start=20
Kim A.,"Sparks, NV",1,25,3,3.0,7/14/2016,"The burgers here are great. My favorite is the whiskey river bbq burger. The best part of the restaurant is the bottomless fries and beverages. However, the staff almost never asks if you want a refill on either of them. I was very upset when I was here yesterday. My boyfriend and I both ordered the cupcake milkshake (which is delicious) BUT mine was barely half full. I walked over to the guy at the bar who makes them and tried to get his attention multiple times. We made eye contact twice and he blatantly ignored me. One of his coworkers acknowledged me and apologized for him because i mentioned how rude he was. I told her my issue about the half full milkshake and she told me it's because the ""classic"" milkshakes are supposed to come half full. ....but my boyfriends milkshake was completely filled to the brim? Not to mention....why pay 5 dollars for a half a cup of a milkshake? It made no sense. She then told me she would make me a new one and to keep the half full one. I walked back to my booth and two minutes later she comes back saying she actually needs to take the old one. Whatever lady. They made us a new one but we pretty much waited 30 minutes for this stupid milkshake. I was annoyed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton?start=20
Valerie S.,"Aston, PA",143,668,802,4.0,9/18/2013,"Stopped for a quick meal at this Red Robin a few days ago.  Other than my husband's fries being cold, we didn't have any other problems with it.  Not really sure I like the new Ipad type thing they have on all the tables - you can order another round of drinks or more appetizers, or summon your waitress.  You can also play games on it for $1.99 a pop I think, and you can also pay your bill.  None of this really worked for us though - only one of us needed a refill, we were paying with cash, and my kids already have games on their smartphones.  It was just kind of useless to me but I guess other people might use it.  Seems to me that it just takes the personal touch out of being waited on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton?start=20
J S.,"East Hanover, NJ",3,52,6,4.0,9/15/2015,"We sat at the bar for a late night dinner. Service was wonderful. Food was great. The bartender was very social and had wonderful drink recommendations. The coolest part is the ""Kiosk"" which allows you to pay your check, based on what you ordered, right at the bar without bothering the bartender. Would recommend coming here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton?start=20
Nick B.,"Fairfax, VA",103,260,16,4.0,7/31/2011,"Okay, call me crazy but, yes, I drove 20 miles (one way!) to come eat here. Why? Because when I lived in California, I used to live about 5 miles from a Red Robin and apparently, I seriously took it for granted. I really missed the never ending steak fries (and delicious blend of spices that many people have told me I should 'take with me' - ahem, that's stealing, so no, I haven't and won't ever do it.) The burgers here are solid. You get to choose your bun (I believe last time, mine had jalapenos in it), cheese and the like. The Red Robin Freckled Lemonade is SO good! You've got to like strawberries to really appreciate it, because they give you some heaping helpings of them with every refill. The last time I was here, service was good, granted - it was pretty late at night so that might be a factor. Oh Red Robin, how I miss you being conveniently located next to me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton?start=20
Rita E.,"Harrisburg, PA",0,3,,1.0,5/8/2016,"We arrived at about 7:45 on a Saturday night with a group of 7 adults and 2 little ones. KIndly told we had a 20 minute wait for a table. Understandable on a busy Saturday night. Got seated as promised, and the restaurant was clearing out quickly. Average wait time to get our drinks ordered but it took about 15 minutes to get them. Placed our order, and since it was late and the babies were tired asked for some fries to hold everyone over. This was promised but never arrived. After about a half hour we started inquiring about our order. By now the restaurant was quite empty and there seemed to be quite a bit of staff on hand, so it didn't really make sense. It was now more than an hour after we arrived and there was still no sign of food, so we asked if we could get it all to go. Half our party left to take the children back to the hotel across the street. We had to round up other servers, because our server apparently vanished. After another 20 minutes or so, we finally received our order, packed to go. We paid and left. Arrived at our hotel across the street and discovered that part of our order was missing. Called the restaurant to inquire, and they apologetically offered to bring it right over to our hotel. Another 20 minutes and we received a call from the front desk asking if we had ordered food from Red Robin. They received a call from another hotel that our food had been (mis)delivered there, but that it would be brought over to our hotel. Ten minutes later it arrived. Two and a half hours after we had arrived, our order was complete.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-exton?start=20
