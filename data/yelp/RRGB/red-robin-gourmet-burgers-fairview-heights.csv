Desiree M.,"Dayton, OH",198,398,704,3.0,8/8/2013,"The only reason Red Robin gets three stars first off is because of their prices, I think they are ridiculously high.  I used to frequent here in Alaska and get there kids meals for myself because the portions of salads and what not are just ridiculously huge.  They should have a little bites or smaller portions on the menu, because if someone wanted a hamburger that didn't want to eat 4000 calories in one burger should have the chance to eat here. My hubby got a hamburger and at the end after adding a few things to it ended up being $14 and some change.  I ended up getting the southwest chicken wrap with chili.  It was okay for a chicken wrap, i think it lacked in flavor.  The chili was really spicy and okay. I do like the atmosphere of red robin, its fun and vibrant.  The servers are usually pretty good.  This is just not my most fav place in the world, but again im not a huge meat eater either. They were out of balloons when we visited :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights?start=20

Elizabeth M.,"Saint Louis, MO",100,163,176,4.0,8/2/2015,"Came here with my kids. I got the garden burger bunless with tomatoes and mushrooms.  It was good, but they didn't give my lettuce wrap, and they charged me extra for the mushrooms, which I found ridiculous seeing as I got nothing else on it. Kids got mac and cheese, and a cheese pizza. Mac and cheese was ok. Pizza was pretty gross. The dough was awful, but I realize this isn't a pizza place, and my daughter's immature taste buds thought it was ok. Fries were good as usual. Waitress was nice.

Sue F.,"Fairview Heights, IL",12,7,,4.0,4/6/2014,"We have been here quite a few times in the last few months and every time we get decent service and good food.  Even our picky child eater likes Red robin and that's hard to accomplish! Burgers are always outstanding, fries are amazing, their fried cod was wonderful and the shrimp was huge and flavorful. Large selection of drinks it that is your thing.  If the server isn't familiar with something they will gladly ask management so you can make an informed choice. I recommend this Red Robin highly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights?start=20

We were a little pressed for time after that 35 minutes or so we waited for the food. Wasn't and didn't have time to send it back for another salad or wait for them to bring and add stuff. The burger our table got the top bun was hard. Even our waiter came over and said boy you must have just hated that burger....ha. Our waiter was also the bartender. It was the first time at this location and probably won't be back. $35 for a regular ole salad and nothing too fancy about the burger!!The sauce for the fries was good and that was probably sadly the best thing. There were no ""bottomless fries"" if there was supposed to be ....they were never filled never asked and never addressed and brought out for more. I've had worst experiences.

Steve K.,"Breese, IL",3,95,13,4.0,9/5/2015,"Higher-than-average prices for well-above-average burgers, Red Robin offers a quality, uncluttered menu.  I had the Banzai burger, a delicious teriyaki + pineapple creation on an artisan bun.  I paired it with a bottle of Dogfish Head 60-minure IPA, one of the world's finest beers.  I was a bit envious of my daughter's bottomless root beer, featuring Barq's, one of the world's finest root beers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights?start=20

Mike T.,"O'Fallon, IL",21,10,,4.0,10/2/2015,"Red Robin is a good burger joint and I can't add much to other reviews except this.  Tonight we went there and have been there probably 20  + times over the years its been open.  They recently updated the place and put Ziosks on every table where you can pay your bill and unbeknownst to me, play games.  My kids were playing with it while we ate and I had a $2 entertainment charge on our bill.  The waitress explained the charge, and I paid it. Will Red Robin refund or rescind this kind of charge if the kiddies get on and click on something that add to my bill? $2 doesn't break my bank, but I don't appreciate a charge like this unless I approve it. If my kid orders something from the waitress I have the option of over ruling if don't want them to have that.  With this Ziosk machine I find it a sneaky way to add to your bill. It won't keep me from going back. I just want to warn people that these types of technology are starting to pop up on your dinner table now and to be aware. Its $2 today, what will it be tomorrow?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights?start=20
Brett P.,"Saint Louis, MO",6,5,3,4.0,5/22/2015,"Call me crazy but I love this place. Service is super fast and the burgers are delicious. I am personally a huge fan of the bleu ribbon burger and the Royal Red Robin burger. The tavern double is also good for just a solid choice. Their beer selection also isn't bad for a chain. Fries always come out piping hot. I highly recommend the sweet and spicy ketchup ( you have to ask for it but it's free) as a perfect compliment to the fries. In short, if you're looking for a flavorful burger and a beer in Fairview Heights, you should stop here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights?start=20

I have multiple food allergies, this misnomer of the places I feel most safe eating at. They are knowledgable and have excellent food safety handling procedures to keep you safe. We eat there a few times a month for a while now, only one time have I had a server get rude about my allergies. I'm so thankful to have places to eat that understand the importance of allergies, and that people with food allergies deserve to eat out too! As for the food itself, it's always amazing.

Todd M.,"Belleville, IL",21,24,,4.0,11/24/2013,"Red Robin has been a good chain of burgers that are actually done correctly, they also recently added a Gluten-Free Menu items that are easy to ask for and the wait staffers know what is and it's GF. I've been here several times and never really had ""bad service"" during my visits, just slightly slow due to lunch and dinner rush times (11-1pm) and (5-7 pm) during the week days. Friday and Saturday nights are usually the most packed times, but Sundays are perfect places to have dinner; as they're usually empty or very low capacity of customers.

Tanya M.,"Cahokia, IL",210,448,66,3.0,6/6/2012,"I took the handsome nephew to Red Robin for lunch. I am saddened that they no longer offer salmon. The was one of my favorite things to get was the salmon burger or a salad with salmon.  we got there a little after 11. The other couple that was there when we walked in were sat at a small booth. the nephew and i were seated behind them at a 4 top booth. i really don't understand why she did not seat them at a regular table, unless they asked for a small table. a little after we got there the hostess sat a couple with toddler twins at a booth and moved them once she saw that she could not fit 2 high chairs at a booth. i think the hostess was a bit new.but any who....................... we ordered a small order of cheese sticks. they were hot but the breading was a bit soggy near the cheese, which gave the cheesesticks an off taste. i ordered the cobb salad. i forget what cutesy name they want to give to it. it was very good. i never knew you could order a half salad. i will have to remember that in the future. I also ordered the roasted veggie soup. it was ok but being broth based I needed crackers and it was not very warm to begin with. i sipped on it til my salad came to the table.  The best part was stealing a few of my nephews bottomless fries!!!!!!!!!!!!!  someone elses fries always taste better. the service was fine. the waitress was friendly but lacked being attentive when we needed her.   i know that the floor plan of the restaurant magnifies sound. I have been to several Red Robins and once you get kids in there screaming it can raise your blood pressure.

Aaron K.,"Chicago, IL",50,232,2,2.0,11/9/2011,"Went here for lunch with a colleague and boy were we disappointed.  The place was completely overrun by moms out with their kids, none of whom seemed to care that there were other people in the restaurant.  The noise level was rather high making it difficult for us to have a conversation without talking over loud children and parents next to us.  Now you may say that this is to be expected, but a few management choices could make it better for everyone.  Why they don't seat the families in one area (away from the bar!) and the business lunch crowd on the other side of the restaurant I have no idea. The food here is your standard Red Robin fare.  Nothing to rave about nor complain. (Like with any chain I expect you know how to google the menu if you can find my review.)

Stan D.,"Maryville, IL",9,21,125,4.0,9/6/2014,"This is NOT the best burger nor the cheapest by far. It IS a good thick burger that you can order from medium-rare to well-done with tasty bottomless fries. The quality of the beef and other ingredients is very good. You have a large variety of burgers to choose from in different sizes and with different toppings, from the classic cheeseburger or patty melt to the A1 Peppercorn and Banzai burger, and everything in between. They also serve a variety of fried and grilled chicken burgers and a cod fillet. They have a handful of dipping sauces to choose from. My favorite is the campfire sauce. If you're in the mood for a salad, they have several nice ones to choose from. One of my favorites is the southwest grilled chicken salad that comes topped with fried jalapeño coins, avocado, cheddar, black beans, bell peppers, onions, roasted corn and tortilla strips with salsa-ranch. Finally, they have a full bar to choose from; beer, margaritas, wines and cocktails. Red Robbin has a nice casual ambiance that I think you'll like. If you're looking for a better than average burger and a nice beverage to wash it down with, you can't go wrong here. P.S. They also have a kid's menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights?start=40

In fact, my last 2 visits to RR have been less than impressive. If I had only eaten at this chain the last two times, I'd not go back. I'm hoping that there was just a glitch and they are not falling down on quality control? Fries and Boca burger were not good.

Cherie O.,"Saint Louis, MO",111,371,117,2.0,12/5/2011,"I've been on the quest for an awesome burger in St. Louis, and Red Robin is definitely not it. Burgers are greasy and slimy and just totally fall apart when you try to eat them. The patty is super thin and they load up the sauce pretty thickly, which is probably why the burgers fall apart. The fries are your regular kind of fries, and the sweet potato fries are marginally better, but not the amazing ones that I have come to crave from other places in St. Louis. Personally, I think Five Guys burgers are more ""gourmet"" than Red Robin's...honestly, what has the world come to where you can throw different ingredients together that you usually wouldn't think of for a burger and call it gourmet?? I order something different every time, and I still have yet to find something on the menu that I like. Given that, it's not a surprise to say that I think that the prices are highly inflated, even with the bottomless fries, which you have to ask for instead of being offered. I wouldn't even have known about it if not for Yelp! Service is better here than it is at the Edwardsville location, but at the same time, it's a lot louder here. I think it's because it's located right by the mall, so especially on weekends, the place is packed because it's an easy stop right before you leave after a day of shopping.  Don't do it, guys...you won't like it!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights?start=40
Jeffrey S.,"Bethalto, IL",14,11,1,1.0,8/28/2012,"This is at least our 3-4th time to this restaurant, but have been to several others in the area and across the country.  This is probably the worst one we have been to, and most likely our last time at this one.  Noise level is horrible.  Not had too much of a problem with others, especially one visited to in the Seattle area. First negative was the noise.  Second was the disappointment in my beer selection.  The waiter mentioned they had the new Oktoberfest in.  Since this is late August I never thought they would be out, but he returned shortly to advise they were.  Ok, made a second selection of beer, which was good, but not what I had my mind on.  Meals were ordered, and almost there, when the waiter came back and I ordered another beer and water for the meal.  Food came.....no beer, no drink.  Waiter came back and said they ran out of the beer I had just had.  I told him to cancel the beer, as he said they were changing kegs, and bring me water.  No water....no water....no water, so I ended up sharing my wife's soda.  Then, just as I was almost finished with my food, the waiter came with the beer and water.  I told him I had cancelled the beer and I did not want it, as I was now finished with the burger and almost with fries.   Manager did come by to apologize ""for the hic-up"" as she said.  I told her was only disappointed with the beer service, and nothing else.  We were not looking for something free or for them to discount anything, and sure did not get offered anything on our return, if we should.  I doubt that we will.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights?start=40

For an appetizer, we had the barbecue pork loaded chips. I was a little bit hesitant but they were great.  For my meal, I had the teriyaki chicken sandwich.  It is absolutely one of my favorite sandwiches.  We also had a BLT on croissant.

Karen H.,"Collinsville, IL",18,9,1,1.0,11/25/2017,"My husband and I went at 12:15 on Black Friday. We were put on a wait list and told 20 minutes. Groups of 3 or more were getting seated ahead of us. We were told that parties of 2 had to wait for a table for 2., I knew that we would have to wait, no problem. After 40 minutes, I was told that there were 5 parties ahead of us (four parties of only 2). I said that this was not acceptable. We were seated at a booth in the bar. The overworked waitress had large parties and it took a while to order and receive our food. My macaroni and cheese arrived cold. It took 15 minutes for the waitress to appear and that was only because my husband waved her down. It took another 15 minutes for a new casserole to arrive.  The caeser salad was drowned in dressing, the lettuce was soft and warm. The manager delivered the replacement,macaroni and said ""I don't know why your food was sent back.""  2 1/2 hours! Miserable. No reason to seat parties of 2 at small tables only. There are only a few small tables so our wait is much longer!! Side note: fancy lemonade drinks are served in such small, fancy shaped glasses that it is very inefficient method.

My husband had the chicken wrap. I had the boneless chicken wings. They were SO GOOD. I can still remember what they taste like.

Sharah C.,"Belleville, IL",34,63,194,3.0,12/9/2016,"I was hungry and wanted a burger so i thought I'd revisit this place. Havent been here in years. They once had a fav appetizer of mine (the rib tips), but I see they have been removed from the menu.  I ordered the smoke & pepper burger. The menu hypes this bad boy up. I made some substitutions like having the burger on the standard sesame seed bun, sharp cheddar instead of extra sharp, and adding carmelized onions. The burger was ok. Cooked perfectly, the bacon was wimpy, it looked thick cut in the picture.  Service was so so. Server was friendly, but I never got my refill of steak fries because she stood around chatting it up with another table and by then I was done with the burger. Le sigh. Will return eventually but I wont be chomping  at the bit to do so. It served its purpose..I wasnt hungry anymore. ***Update**** Now that I think over my dining experience..this place is way too expensive.  My ""gourmet"" angus beef hamburger with an addition of carmelized onions, fries, added a garlic sauce for dipping, and a soda came to $19!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights
Robyn K.,"Saint Louis, MO",125,13,11,4.0,5/16/2017,"I don't typically like to review chain because once you've had one you've had them all BUT Red Robin has some of the best burgers ever. I love their veggie burgers and endless fries. Also, can't forget chipotle mayo.. my fave! I got the Burnin Love with the veggie burger and was so satisfied. The restaurant itself is an average chain place and the service is cool. If you love spicy.. grab the burnin love for sure",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights
Tom R.,"Belleville, IL",47,125,56,5.0,6/29/2017,"Great experience yet again at this location. The service is always great and this Brittany was our server and was awesome! Love the burgers, love the endless steak fries, and love that they get in and out with very little wait times even at peak hours! YUMMMMM!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights
Jessica C.,"Richmond Heights, MO",67,3,,5.0,7/22/2017,My family went here for my son's birthday and the service was great. Our waitress was very nice and helpful. Will definitely be coming back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights
Lori B.,"Canonsburg, PA",8,179,453,5.0,6/23/2016,"Well, we have been to this Red Robin location about 8 months ago and I unfortunately was not impressed. My turkey burger wasn't good, the service wasn't great, just all around not a pleasant experience.  Well, the hubs wanted a burger on Father's Day and requested we go back to RR.  Wow, what a difference.  First off, I have to say from the host to the waitress to the busboy the servers were friendly and accommodating.  I can see they must have made some changes and implemented some training because it was night and day.  Secondly, the food was great.  I had the Southern Charm Burger, so delicious, with candied bacon and caramelized onions and sharp cheddar.  Cooked to perfection I might add, with a little pink in the center. I had it open faced to save some calories and opted for a side salad instead of fries.  I love all of the new options RR has in order to save calories or for a little something different.  Check it out, great options, some are an additional cost, but well worth it.  My husband had the Smoke and Pepper burger.  He said it was very juicy and spicy, but not too much.  He also got more fries since they are all you can eat!  I recommend becoming a member of the Red Robin Royalty club to get discounts on meals.  We were able to save 20% on our meal using that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights
Suzanna P.,"Hinesville, GA",0,5,1,1.0,1/22/2017,If I could have 0 stars I would. Terrible service from our waitress Kelsie. We've seen her once since we got our meal after waiting almost an hour. My bread on the French dip was soggy because they spilled the sauce on the plate.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights
Kimmy N.,"Saint Louis, MO",55,386,1522,3.0,9/8/2015,Can't say much about the service or atmosphere but my sister brought me home a wedge salad and it was either very good because I was hungry or it was just really good lol. Honestly you can't beat it for 3$. It was a little on the salty side but still good. Will definitely buy it again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights
Lori G.,"O'Fallon, IL",0,11,11,3.0,12/6/2016,The service was fairly slow but this server was friendly and nice. The food was acceptable with no complaints except the grilled cheese sandwich was fairly burnt on one side.  My main reason for not giving it more stars is because of check out. If you're not paying cash you have to check yourself out at your table because they are too cheap to pay a person to check you out with your credit card. I'm not going out to dinner to do their job for them.  The machine would not work for anyone in our party and we could no longer get our server back to our table. We got our cash together and left it on the table. This was a very disappointing way to end our meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights
Erik F.,"Belleville, IL",6,15,3,1.0,11/28/2016,"I love their burgers, menu is great. The service is always terrible. Tonight was my son's birthday, he chose this place. They never brought out the fries (this has happened a couple times). If you have no intention of keeping to what you advertise, STOP advertising it!!! The wait staff never sang the bday song, never got the birthday Sundae. (Which is what they told me they'd do). Just disappointed with the service, again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights
Anastasia T.,"Glen Burnie, MD",399,503,303,4.0,6/7/2013,"Back in my omnivore days, I could not get enough of their mushroom swiss burger. Every time my mom would take me here for lunch, it was all I could bring myself to order. Times (and their menu) have definitely changed. They offer a veggie burger (and a vegan Boca burger) and they are more than willing to swap out one of their specialty burgers for you. I cannot remember the name of it, but they have an entree that is substantially spicy. Breaded jalapenos, spicy sauce -- the works. It's amazing and never ceases to knock my tastebuds' socks off. Although my tiny stomach does not benefit from this, I must note, their super thick, delicious fries are BOTTOMLESS. Eat all you want and they will refill your fries for you!  It's definitely a burger joint, but vegetarians (and vegans alike!) can indulge as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights
Matthew S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",85,120,1,1.0,3/18/2016,"Thanks for the Food Poisoning and violent vomiting, me, along with the people who shared 2 airplane rides really appreciate your diligence (lack there of) in ensuring your food is fresh and fit to serve; don't worry, I made them aware of who the culprit was behind my condition.

Cory F.,"Saint Louis, MO",52,11,39,5.0,2/5/2016,I really love the layout change and rebranding. This is my go to place for Burgers if I want Pizza I go to Flamentco's The Place but when it comes to a great burger I go to red robin the southern charm is my favorite burger hold the Mayo!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights
