John D.,"Knoxville, TN",37,4,,4.0,1/4/2018,Just had lunch with friends I hadn't seen in over a year. Cheeseburger with bottomless fries was great. The service was good. They let my tea glass sit empty for about 5 minutes or I would have rated them higher. Got more fries on my reorder than I got with my burger. They were hot and so many I couldn't eat them all. Overall a great experience. Looking forward to our next visit.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-farragut
James M.,"Corryton, TN",28,28,18,4.0,9/1/2017,We haven't had Red Robin since we moved from Michigan but we are happy we gave this location a chance even though the ratings didn't look great. The service was good and the food was as good as we remembered from Michigan. I had the Black and Blue Burger and it was cooked perfectly plus we got so many fries none of us needed refills. We visited on a busy Saturday afternoon but quickly got a table and did not feel rushed by our server at all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-farragut
Gwendolyn M.,"Knoxville, TN",111,138,237,4.0,8/23/2017,It has been years since I have eaten at a Red Robin and I have missed it. We had one close by in Michigan and didn't even know this one was in Knoxville as we live on the opposite side of town. My daughter was excited when she discovered this was in driving distance. We went on a busy Saturday afternoon and the staff was super friendly and attentive. The food was as good as I remembered and everyone in our group of  enjoyed their choice. I had the Black and Blue burger and loved how all the flavors melded together. We also started the meal with the towering onion rings and they were the perfectly fried. There were so many fries with our burger that none of us needed a refill. I won't be waiting as long as last time to be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-farragut
Crystal G.,"Knoxville, TN",0,4,,1.0,11/12/2017,"We had a terrible experience here our last visit. We arrived about 9:30 on a Friday night and were immediately seated. Our server took forever to get our drink orders/orders, and we watched our server touch the ends of our straws with his hands as he put them in the glass. When we finally go our food, which again... Took way longer than it should have considering the restaurant was pretty empty.. Our fries tasted like the oil hadn't been changed in a week, the pub mac tasted like it had been heated in the microwave, and the au jus was stone cold (even after sending it back once.) At one point our server came to our table and told us another server would be taking over because he ""wanted to start cleaning so he could hurry and get out of there."" Horrible service and we will definitely not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-farragut
Ian G.,"Knoxville, TN",7,139,1,3.0,1/4/2017,"Really just another ok chain restaurant. I ordered a chili burger which was overcooked. The chili was almost tasteless and barely warm. No tomato or onion on my burger so I had to ask for tomato and onion. What they brought me 5 minutes later was almost a joke.  My wife ordered a burger with guacamole which was that cheap guacamole spread and very little of it. We both had salad as our side which was a very uninteresting salad mix.  Service was ok...I didn't feel like the restaurant was very well run. We waited too long to be seated, waited too long for our server and waited too long for our food.  I think for $11.00 there are alot better burger places in knoxville.  I mean it was ok...no real complaints but just nothing to make me want to return anytime in the near future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-farragut
Brittney M.,"Lenoir City, TN",21,5,3,4.0,11/3/2017,"Very good! I had a burger lettuce wrap with sweet potato fries! It's nice they have healthier options! I'm only giving 4 instead of 5 stars because it's always a long wait for a host to show up to seat us. Plus it's a little pricey.

Alexandra P.,"Knoxville, TN",84,122,248,4.0,7/11/2017,"We love that Red Robin is vegan friendly and you can't beat bottomless fries! So, we have eaten at many RR locations. We stopped by this location at 2pm on a Saturday. It was pretty quiet but not surprising for the time of day. We had great service! We were seated right away and promptly greeted by our server. Our drinks were never empty long. Both my husband and I ordered boca burgers. The burgers were, as always, delicious. We didn't need to ask for more fries. Our server noticed when our plates were getting low and asked if we wanted more fries. They came out hot and fresh. I love that we can pay our bill at our table using the tablet. Very convenient!The only issue I had at this location was the bathroom. There were two stalls for women and despite it being slow, there was a line out the door. I got in line but after several minutes the same two people were still in there. There were at least 5 people in line ahead of me as well. I had a lot of water so I knew this would be a problem! Lol I actually left and went to Marshall's next door. When I got back, I noticed there was STILL a line. Ridiculous!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-farragut
Dave C.,"Knoxville, TN",72,17,1,1.0,3/13/2017,"A poor experience all around.

Lori W.,"Knoxville, TN",3418,1057,1568,1.0,6/5/2015,"Upon walking in here the noise in this establishment was overwhelming...echo galore. Very busy. The gal walked us to a booth that was dirty. She went to grab a rag from the bar to clean it, left it still dirty, we was very embarrassed as everyone was looking at us and that table. We then requested a different table. She gladly walked us to a different table. Ordered the short stack onion rings. They came to us, very soggy onions...wasn't a good batter. The batter tasted as if it were burnt..overcooked. The gourmet hamburger. I would assume this is a frozen patty. Nothing gourmet about this. Tastes like a burger king patty. The freckled fruit, which I asked the waitress what it was, she said it was apples, strawberries and oranges. What she failed to tell us was it was in a sugary strawberry syrup...which for my husband being a diabetic is Not good. Will NOT be back ....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-farragut
KeithandShelia B.,"Siesta Key, FL",36,1,,1.0,10/16/2017,Not good at all. Fries were cold. My order was void of the toppings that was to come with my burger so I had to wait for them to come out as a side order meanwhile my burger was cold.

Walter C.,"Knoxville, TN",1,55,5,2.0,3/10/2017,The food is good once you get it.  This place is always slow.  If son didn't love it so I would never go here.  Good mushroom and swiss burger.  My son ordered sweet potato fries but they brought regular fries.  When we asked they said they were holding on sweet potato fries and we had to get a manager ti get then eventually.  Ridiculous.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-farragut
Colby M.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",61,73,93,5.0,5/20/2017,My husband and I hear the other day I work in a hotel when I stared at this commercial all week so we decided to go there for lunch was not disappointed the service from the time you open the door to the time you said your table your server everybody that came by asked you how your food was so friendly the food was amazing and delicious she even brought extra sauces for the fries they had so many delicious choices for burgers was very hard to decide what I wanted to eat but I settled on a Mushroom Swiss burger and I was not disappointed and sweet potato fries so good we'll definitely come back to this location,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-farragut
Jeff E.,"Knoxville, TN",24,43,5,3.0,6/22/2016,"The burgers are pretty good and if you try really hard, you can find a time to go when there are few or no children around.   We all know why you go, though.  Unlimited fries.  Sometimes I eat them out of spite.  Yes, I know I'm in physical pain, but bring me more fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-farragut
Rich M.,"Knoxville, TN",14,27,17,3.0,9/26/2015,"My usual item of choice is the Blue Ribbon Burger (substituting the GardenBurger since I'm a vegetarian.)  The Gardenburger patty is very good and it's much better than the Boca.  The Bleu Cheese and special sauce make this burger a winner, although sometimes the multigrain bun often feels like it's more than a few days old.  At over $10, this is definitely a luxury burger. On this visit I decided to go cheap and just order the regular GardenBurger for $8.  Without the bleu cheese, it was a little disappointing.  Thankfully the fries and Campfire sauce saved the day. The service was pretty lousy.  They have these new touchpads on the table so you can play games (for $1.99 per game, yeah right!) and pay your bill.  I think that the servers use this as a crutch to neglect your table.  We were never asked how our food was and I had to call the guy over to order more fries.   I'll probably return someday for the Blue Ribbon Burger, but my expectations are much lower now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-farragut
Lori F.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,12,,1.0,12/31/2016,"First time at a Red Robin and last. I only write good reviews yet today I need to warn those not to bother. Don't Believe the hype that this is worth $10 for a burger. I have had a thicker burger at McDonalds. 5 guys blows this place away. Our server was nice yet clearly not enough people working. Totally forgot to put in one of our orders. Cold fries. Stale buns. Forgot cheese on a cheeseburger. Over cooked thin burger. Gross. Red Robin is known for burgers? Really? Also No ketchup. Watched another person at a table walk from table to table looking for a full bottle of ketchup. She had No luck. We did the same but scored the last bottle. Lucky us. Is it just this location?

Aaron J.,"Knoxville, TN",25,33,8,1.0,3/23/2016,"I don't know what has happened to this place besides the obvious remodeling. The serving staff looks lower class and the service shows. Here's what went wrong yesterday: 1. Molded and dry limes were brought with my drink 2. My son's meal only came with 6 meatballs instead of 9. When they brought the other 3 they were over cooked and hard.  3. I asked for a fried egg over hard and got a very runny fried egg.  4. They brought me another fried egg which was better but still not cooked right.  5.  The burger was extremely salty.  6.  It's March Madness and they had no basketball games on in the dining area. They didn't even have a sports channel on. I know this is a small thing, but given that other restaurants are playing sports during tournament season you think RR would too.  This place used to be pretty good, but I'd choose other places for a burger over Red Robin. I told my kids we weren't coming back. The time before this time it took over an hour to get our food so something has changed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-farragut
William M.,"Maryville, TN",46,220,39,4.0,11/21/2015,"Let's face it, there is a plethora of chain burger & beer joints around, but Red Robin is my favorite. Good service, good food and all you can eat fries, what more could you ask for?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-farragut
Frieda P.,"Knoxville, TN",80,4,,4.0,5/16/2016,"My husband and I visited RR for lunch so that I could try their gluten-free bun I've heard so much about. When I asked the hostess for a gluten-free menu, she told me she is celiac and could help me make decisions about what to order.  Our server, Freddie, came right over to take our drink order and overhead our conversation. He was really helpful, and I asked him the brand of the bun. He went back to ask, and the manager came back with him a piece of the box that has the name. Freddie assured me that everything I ate would be gluten-free.  Our meals came in a reasonable length of time, and the hamburger bun was the best gf I've had so far. As promised, it had good body and did not crumble. Mine stayed together better than my husband's regular bun! I saved half to eat tonight, and any other bun would have been left behind.  I asked about the extra cost, and it's just $1.00. If you are familiar with gluten-free products, you know they are expensive!  Freddie told me that I can buy them to take home, so I did!  Now, you may think that my review had more to do with the bun baker than it does about Red Robin. I'm writing the review because I was treated with such concern and interest by all three employees. Too, they offer a product that I haven't seen anywhere else.  The restroom was clean and smelled good. So why not give them five stars? Well, except for the bun, I would have chosen to go down the road to Steak and Shake to eat for half the price or less. Still, I was happy we went and that we received good food and service. Well done, Turkey Creek Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-farragut
Josh W.,"Knoxville, TN",0,3,,1.0,5/1/2016,"I have to be honest, it takes a really bad experience for me to right a negative review. I worked in the restaurant industry for many years so I know that there are just bad days. Unfortunately I now have had two in a row with this Red Robin. Last night I decided to give them another chance because by 4 year old son loved it there. It started off well. We only had to wait for a few minutes to get a table but it pretty much went downhill from there. After sitting at our table for over 15 minutes (made eye contact with multiple servers during this time) we finally had our server take our drink order. He himself was very friendly but clearly was overwhelmed. It took at least 15 minutes for my drink to come out, my son luckily got his within a few minutes. After sitting at our table for over 30 minutes he was finally able to take our food order. At this point I was still enjoying my time with my son so it was no big deal. When I placed my order I told my service that I normally like my burger cooked medium-well but at my last visit I ordered it that way it unfortunately came out medium-rare, so I went ahead and asked for it to be cooked well done. Well it came out rare and almost raw in the middle. Again I'm normally understanding and had the cook/server had but a rush on it because we had already had to wait so long for everything else I would have been understanding but it took 50 minutes for my burger to out. Yep, you read that right, it took them 50 minutes to cook me a rare burger. The manger, who I might add was very unprofessional looking, tried to smooth it over but at this point I was just ready for my check. During my 50 minute wait i ordered some fried pickles which came out burnt, I sent those back and the reorder came out a little better but we're still over cooked (I'm thinking the oil was at too high of a temperature).  I would have to say the problems with this Red Robin probably stem from poor management but it really had to judge that fairly based on my experience with one manager. He seems to just float around the restaurant with out a care in the world socializing, all while I sat there and watch people's food sit up in the window under heat lamps for up to 10-15 minutes at a time. Needless to say I will more then likely not be going back to this Red Robin, not until it is managed a little better. From what I noticed in their recent reviews on here I'm not the only one who feels this way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-farragut
Bob D.,"Hazard, KY",6,56,55,3.0,4/21/2012,"We stopped at the Red Robin, which is located in the Turkey Creek Shopping Area of Knoxville TN.  I notice that the table we were sat at was a little on the dirty side, and we were only given 2 menus although we had a table of 6 (the hostess was a little lacks in her duties).  Our waitress on the other hand was exceptional and did a wonderful job waiting on us.  The menu consisted of the Banzai Burger, Banzai style chicken sandwich, salads and some French Onion Soup.  All was delivered promptly, but the soup, which came out very much as an after thought.   All together, the price was around $70.00 w/tip which I think is rather high for a burger  place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-farragut?start=40
Ashley H.,"Knoxville, TN",12,23,14,2.0,2/4/2015,"Disappointing. I was really in the mood for a Burger and wanted to try some place new to me. So I figured why not go to Red Robin where they are well known for their burgers. I ordered the Red Tavern Double with fries and a drink. The service was awful! The waitress I had was very rude. I went with some of my friends. We ended up having to ask another waiter for a refill on our drinks. We waited 40 minutes from the time we were seated for our burgers. We did not order anything special. Just burgers with cheese. I personally feel like you should not have to wait that long for a meal. I could make a burger and fries in less time then that. However, the burger was really good! The prices are decent to. You can find meals that are less than $10 and that is always nice. I do not think I am likely to go there again simply because I do not want to wait that long for food. I was already hunger when I arrived so having to wait 40 more minutes, I was starving by then.  2/5",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-farragut?start=40

Greg S.,"Knoxville, TN",1,35,2,3.0,1/22/2013,"IMO it's a fine place to eat.  You can have TONS of fries.  But, darn are these burgers expensive or what?  I call it ""Red Robin, the home of the $10 hamburger"" ... and, they are not even that large on the lunch portion.  It's fine, the service is fine, the burgers are good - but it's just impractical for me to eat here and there is nothing that can bring me back - unless the fools that I work with say ""Lunch? Red Robin? You going?"" and I have no one else to go with - and I have to go with them.    And I'll complain the whole way there too.

Irving L.,"Killeen, TX",4,7,2,2.0,9/8/2014,"Been a few months since we've dined here. We waited 28 minutes for a burger and a chicken sandwich. The prices have gone up, as well. Specialty burgers are $10-11, and the 3 premium burgers are almost $15.  The food was warm, not hot, and the amount of fries with the order is laughable. Yes, it's bottomless fries, but the second order took 10 minutes to come out.  The staff appeared to be somewhat indifferent to giving a memorable experience to the patrons.

My burger was ok. Lettuce was wet and the tomato was an end piece that was pale orange and hard.The onion rings were tasty but fell apart when picked up. My husband's peppercorn burger was good but had no pepper corns.Requested mustard and had to flag the server down to get it because he forgot. Not too busy so am not sure how he forgot.He did ask if we wanted more fries and did deliver  our crispy fries fairly quickly. Really liked the touch pad pay feature.

Bonnie M.,"Knoxville, TN",84,19,21,3.0,1/5/2012,"My boyfriend and I had dinner here with another couple around 8 on a Tuesday night. The restaurant was not crowded even though it was ""Jim Day."" All Jims/JImmys/Jimbos could try the new Jim Beam burger for free just by showing ID! My boyfriend, was able to take advantage of this offer and liked the burger. He really liked the sweet bourbon glaze and said he would order it again. The other burgers that were not bad at all, but they weren't anything to write home about, especially for the price. My guacamole burger could have been more flavorful. It would have been better with more seasoning on the meat itself, and with spicier guacamole. The other couple with us thought the burgers were OK. They both got sweet potato fries and really liked them. We liked the fact that you can customize your burger. Red Robin has around five different types of bread to choose from, including whole grain, jalapeno, etc. You can choose from beef, a veggie patty, chicken, etc. The Red Robin website is really cool and lets you see the nutrition facts of your customized burger. Surprisingly, it was pretty easy to come up with a relatively healthy meal. They also offer broccoli and fruit as healthy side choices. Of course they have plenty of delicious fattening sides such as mac and cheese, sweet potato fries and steak fries. The service was excellent. Our waiter was efficient and friendly.

Pescetarian N.,"Knoxville, TN",17,21,162,4.0,3/21/2010,"Nom-Nom! ^__^ Yes, this place is also great for Vegetarians! I was pleasantly surprised when I found out Red Robin is vegetarian friendly! They have amazing Boca burgers. It's not the kind you find in the freezer section at the grocery store that's flat, flavorless, and microwave ready. These are thick, juicy, and strangely burger like. It is the closest thing to a real burger a vegetarian could have! (They also have veggie patties if your not a Boca person, but I have never tried these.)  You can choose from one of 15 or so ways to have your burger garnished. I have tried it Guacamole'd, Mushroom Swiss'd, BBQ'd, but my favorite is the Classic Cheeseburger. All burgers are served with all-you-can-eat steak fries. I'm not usually a steak fry fan, but these are super yummy and always hot.  Red Robin has appetizers such as Onion Rings, Chips and Guacamole, and Cheese Sticks. They also have chicken and fish sandwiches and salads.  While most places that serve this kind of food usually serve up a greasy stomach ache, Red Robin somehow makes it taste fresh and delicious! ^__^",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-farragut?start=40

Becky K.,"Knoxville, TN",2,43,,5.0,5/11/2009,"Though the name is new to many Knoxville residents, the restaurant is celebrating its 40th year.  They began in Seattle in 1969.  They specialize in delicious gourmet burgers with bottomless steak fries, plus a mile high mud pie that literally will levitate four kids into a sugar high.  We got hooked on Red Robin back in Portland, OR.  They followed us when we moved back to Texas and I'm glad to see they're here for Knoxville residents to enjoy.   What to try?  If you have a manly appetite and aren't afraid of saturated fats, try the Royal Red Robin.  It's a bacon cheeseburger with a fried egg.  If you like lighter fare, the Ensenada Platter has two grilled chicken breasts, two dipping sauces, and a side salad with dressing of your choice.  In between, there's fish and chips, fish tacoes, and a whole lot of West-Coast specialties. Get there early.  The place only opened April 21, but they are often SRO in the waiting area with a line overflowing outside.  Food is excellent and consistent.  Service is some of the best in town.  The place is clean.  Only downside are lines and noise in the restaurant.  Others have put in plexigas partitions to dampen the riot of sound across the floor.  Hopefully, this  location will do so too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-farragut?start=40
Lone M.,"Corryton, TN",0,3,,1.0,3/11/2017,"Ordered their Gourmet Cheeseburger (""The one that made them famous"" so they wrote). Not even comparable to Burger King! Slow service and the burger and fries were barely warm. My wife ordered the chicken breast and salad. The chicken was barely warm and the salad was sparse and tasteless. The chicken breast appeared to be a processed and compressed patty. It could not pass as an actual breast or fresh. The ""bottomless steak fries"" (which were mealy) consisted of 8-10 pieces and were not bottomless. We hardly saw the server and he did not ask if I wanted more fries. The tab for the food/tax was $25.00.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-farragut?start=20
Virginia T.,"Bulls Gap, TN",15,64,5,1.0,8/24/2015,"We were ripped off at this Red Robin on 8/18/15. The Tavern Double Burger was supposed to be free as they advertised in an email they sent, but because they have a new table-side tablet to pay through, we got overcharged.  The tablet also has trivia games that cost $1.99 (which is ridiculous when everyone has free games on their smartphones). My husband started a game session, not knowing we were going to be charged and we played some lame trivia games. Then the waitress, Michele, convinced us to pay early with the tablet which ended our game 'session'. So we got ripped off that money too. We were told we had to wait some undetermined number of days and the Tavern burger would be credited, but my confidence in their customer service is low. Very low. To date, we still haven't gotten our refund. The Tavern Double burger itself was dry and overcooked. The endless fries were okay but nothing special. DO NOT use the table-side tablet no matter how great the waitress says it is because they will RIP YOU OFF. And they cannot fix the mistake once it has been made. No one even tried to make us happy with being overcharged. Their big suggestion on how to make it right was to have us buy $6.99 in dessert which would offset the cost of the burger. That is absurd to suggest to 2 diabetics! Is it that they just don't care about their customers and are trying to make a few extra bucks off of us? The whole experience was UNACCEPTABLE and we will be telling everyone we know.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-farragut?start=20

He didn't even touch it yet and u could see it.  They were soooo nice and took the burger off. really? And offered a free desert. Normally mgrs  take care of the bill. Sorry we won't ever be back.

Bryan M.,"Knoxville, TN",97,39,3,1.0,5/22/2015,"I dont particularly like posting negative reviews with one star but I have to.  This is purely based on service. My wife, who recently returned to work from having our first child, went to meet some co-workers for a girls night out dinner.  When entering the restaurant she realized they were sitting on the bar side and approached them.  When she got to the table, one of the female employees announced loudly that she couldnt have our five month old on that side of the restaurant because of the bar.  If you're going to advertise yourself as a family restaurant, then have some couth and understanding with sensitive situations. This employee embarrassed my wife in front of her friends and the other patrons of the restaurant.

Michelle B.,"Knoxville, TN",4,26,5,1.0,3/2/2015,"For a place that has specialty burgers, to fail at making a burger is inexcusable and that's why I'm giving them one star. Now I can't judge for other Red Robin locations only this one and it is definitely not good. We went here on a Sunday afternoon because we had a gift card and it was busy we had to wait maybe 20 minutes to be seated which was understandable. We got an appetizer of boneless hot wings and they were good. We each got a cheeseburger and they were definitely disappointing. The worst part about the burgers is that they were cold, they tasted like they had pre made many burgers just to have them ready since obviously that's their most popular item. There was nothing special about the flavor definitely will not go back here, to be honest you can get a better burger at several other places in Turkey Creek and around that area than here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-farragut?start=20

Kevin Y.,"Philadelphia, PA",309,116,12,3.0,8/30/2013,"Ever since Red Robin opened up a franchise in Turkey Creek, it's been my favorite (and most convenient) spot to satisfy my occasional cravings for shakes, fries, and burgers. I just love trying out all of their specialty burgers, and the unlimited steak fries are definitely a plus when going out to a meal with friends. Unfortunately, my latest experience at Red Robin was not as pleasant as the previous ones. Our server seem unnaturally aggressive in getting my friend and I finished with our meal and out of the restaurant, and she would check on us every few minutes to ask if  we were ready for the check yet. We found her behavior to be really unusual because it should have been blatantly obvious that we weren't even close to being finished yet. From a service perspective, I definitely did not feel welcome or comfortable at all. On top of that, the Blue Ribbon burger that I normally enjoy seemed to have way too much sauce put on top of it. The chipotle mayo actually overpowered the rest of the burger, and I barely tasted the strong blue cheese taste that I love so much. The mint brownie shake was still as good as I remember, but the person who prepared it did not bother wiping down the outside of the glass before bringing it to the table. Milk shake was dripping from the glass, and my hands got sticky just trying to drink from the thing. The whole meal was just really unfortunate because it was my friend's first time at Red Robin, and she just didn't get the positive experience that I normally get here. While I was originally going to give this particular Red Robin 4 stars, I unfortunately have to deduct a star for this unfortunate dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-farragut?start=20
