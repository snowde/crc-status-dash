Laura H.,"Wahiawa, HI",110,113,347,3.0,8/2/2017,"The service was the suckiest part. Good burger but our server was no where to be found most the time. The little checkout thing didn't work the one on the tables so we were disappointed to be seated at the only one that was off.

Krisna S.,"Charlotte, NC",37,77,27,2.0,12/28/2017,"I love Red Robin but I don't like it here. They're so stingy with the ""bottomless"" fries and the hostess was such a jerk.  We came in at a busy-ish time, so, I let the hostility slide. After ordering, the waitress did a really bad job at tending to us and making sure everything was okay. However, I assumed the time of the day played into effect about how we were being treated. The burgers were good and like any other Red Robin as expected from a chain restaurant so nothing really strikes out on this which gives the two stars in my rating.  I've visited other Red Robins, like the one in North Lake and there was such a drastic difference in atmosphere and service when compared to Fayetteville's. It's such a shame because I love this restaurant. Unfortunately, this is just going to be a restaurant I avoid, especially if it's a bad day for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville
Kira B.,"South Haven, MI",6,17,40,2.0,12/20/2017,"This is my first visit to a Red Robin. I have to say that this review is more influenced by our server. She started by walking up, offering us the bottomless root beer floats only to promptly tell us we couldn't have them when one of our party ordered one. She was very slow to refill the bottomless drinks and fries and instead stood at a table behind us to flirt with two guys (which is where she spent most of her time).  We asked if we could switch our drink refills to a different bottomless drink and she informed us that we would be charged more if we did. We are not sure of the validity of her information, but we all believed her to be incorrect. Why would they charge us more for a different bottomless drink that was the same price or less expensive?  We ordered some pretzel bites, which came with half of a small container of dipping cheese for a large amount of pretzels. I had to ask three times for extra cheese before she bothered to come back with it and seemed overall disinterested in serving us.  The food came out relatively quick considering our larger party, but the garlic fries and burger buns were soggy with grease. Aside from the soggy bread, the burger was above average but nothing to write home about. The sweet potato fries were pretty good though.  Once we paid, the waitress never came back and ignored us. We were still eating and awaiting refills. We waited over 20 minutes before we eventually went up and asked for them.  Overall,  I think I'll pass on visiting Red Robin in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville

Keturah E.,"Richmond, VA",14,82,137,3.0,7/4/2016,"I did not enjoy my experience the last time I was here. During that visit I learned NOT to order anything except a burger.  There was not a wait even though it was pretty crowded in the restautant. Before we actualy sat down the hostess walked away. We ended up not even sitting where she was placing us. We sat somewhere else. Another server saw us and asked if we preferred to sit in a booth and she reseated us (thank God for her).  The server is great and has had a positive attitude. I feel comfortable that she is going to make sure the experience goes well.  So far we've ordered burgers. I was the only one at the table who made special requests (as usual). I asked to swap the Iceberg lettuce my burger came with for Romaine lettuce. I was told there is a $0.50 charge to sub the lettuce! I always sub the lettuce at EVERY restaurant I go to and this is the first time I've been charged to substitute nasty stinky Iceberg lettuce. My bacon cheeseburger was alright. Nothing to write home about. I don't know why I keep trying Red Robin. . . I think this was the last time.

It wasn't crowded as it was on a Monday about 6:45pm. Well the four of us got up and began walking out with still no one stopping to ask if we been served. We've been here a few times and this was terrible, and I told the girl up front that it was my son's birthday. Thanks for a great birthday dinner! NOT!!! Never eating here ever again.

Peter G.,"Fort Bragg, NC",2,51,37,4.0,6/19/2017,"What is up RR ???  I knew it would be busy because of a payday Friday but cmon !!! After being seated by a very nice server it took 15 minutes to get our drinks and another 30 minutes for food.  Now mind you I have been to RR many times , most recently last month in another state but this was my first in Fayetteville.  I always order the same burger, Royal Red Robin, always so big I can barely finish it.  To my surprise what I got at this RR was a beef patty the same size as single regular Mickey D burger, I was shocked, and to make matters worse approximately 8-10 fries, cmon.  I wanted to question the server about the size of the burger but I kind of knew what the answer would be.  Don't get me wrong it was a tasty meal, got more fries and refills on drinks but I still feel I was shortchanged.  I hope someone from RR would read this and respond.  6/19/2017 We returned to RR for my annual Birthday Burger.  The last time we were here it was not good.  I contacted RR customer service after our last visit.  RR contacted me about our concerns and was sent a credit.

Kris P.,"Crestview, FL",5,4,1,1.0,8/12/2017,"This is the worst Red Robin I have ever had the misfortune to go to. Upon entering the restaurant, we waited 5 minutes to get seated but that was understandable. Once we got seated, we continued to wait an additional 20 minutes before anyone even took the time to come to the table to get our drink order. By then, we were ready to go. When the same waitress walked past the table 3 times and took another order that came in after us. I will never come back to this place again.

Christina L.,"Winston-Salem, NC",293,518,1894,4.0,3/20/2017,"Came here for a quick, late dinner after watching a late night movie. We were informed as soon as we were seated that the kitchen was closing in 15 minutes, half an hour prior to actual closing hour, which seems oddly early....Despite this, we were still treated very well! Yes, we were rushed to order, but once we put our orders in, we no longer felt rushed by the staff. I had a bowl of Chili (beans and peppers, topped with cheddar and red onions for $5.89), which turned out to be spicier than I expected. Not one of the best bowls of chili I've ever had, but not terrible either. I would have liked some sour cream on top to help cool off some of the spiciness. My boyfriend had a burger with fries on the side. Even though it was near closing, we still received free refills on the fries! We dipped the fries in chipotle ranch sauce, which tastes awesome! And our server made sure to refill our water without us asking. I didn't order anything fancy, but considering how late it was, we had a great experience and were treated respectfully.

Joe S.,"Fort Bragg, NC",0,60,1,1.0,10/8/2016,"I would run out of space before i finished with everything wrong with this establishment. The fries are slow to come out and greasy, the burgers are RAW on the inside even when you specifically ask for them to be well done. The waitress attempted to explain that the burgers are made on a conveyor like a pizza and they run them through twice if someone doesnt want it pink. so much for freshly grilled with care and attention.

Shana C.,"San Jose, CA",0,15,6,3.0,1/2/2016,"I went to Red Robin on a Friday night. The place was packed.  Our server was Louis. He had about 8 tables it seemed, and he handled them all very well. He was attentive, but he still managed to get to everyone in a timely manner. He was courteous, and he came back just enough to let us know he hadn't forgotten us while not feeling like he was being intrusive. We recieved GREAT service. Thank you, Louis. The food on the other hand was not so great. Specifically, the macaroni and cheese. I got some kind of burger, and it was delicious. However I'm concerned about the quality of meat served because I wasn't allowed to have my burger served rare. That is usually an indication that the meat is not too quality. My BOTTOMLESS sweet potato fries were also spot on.  My husband got a different burger and macaroni and cheese. It was quite literally just cooked macaroni with melted cheese in top. No seasonings. No butter, milk, or anything else. If you come from anywhere below the Mason-Dixon line, you eill not be pleased with this side!

Angela C.,"Charleston, SC",4,33,8,1.0,11/6/2015,"So far this entire dining experience leaves me wishing we had just gotten burgers at a fast food place. The waiter took forever to come get our drink order. He seemed frazzled like maybe he was overwhelmed with the 5 tables he had.  We ordered drinks and our meals at the same time as our food as we had more than ample time to look at the menu.  Our drinks finally arrived and my margarita was probably the most poorly made margarita I've ever had. It tasted like I was drinking sweet and sour mix straight from the cup. There were no straws to stir it so I walked to the bar to get some. The bartender was rude and asked ""oh you want straws. We don't have any"". This restaurant charges for extremely overpriced burgers and can't afford stir straws?!?!???  I managed to choke down the margarita without breathing so I wouldn't taste it as the waiter did not care that I said it was disgusting with no offer to replace it. I ordered a bottled beer instead thinking they couldn't mess that up. I was wrong. Instead of my bottled hard root beer, he brought it serves over ice cream, which I did not order and which cost $4 MORE than just the beer. I said fine don't worry about it, as my beer sat on the bar for 5 mins before I even got it and didn't want to wait another 5 mins for a drink (I was in full view of the bar and timed it).  The burgers were decent as usual. Not worth $15, but tasted good. I was not able to finish the root beer float concoction because it was not only very heavy with a large burger, but because it tasted terrible.  The bartender and waiter were both unconcerned with our complaints and we paid the check in full. I didn't make a huge issue of it, I just wanted to leave.  I WILL NOT be returning to this particular Red Robin due to the terrible service and poor attitude of a very untrained bartender. If you aren't drinking this will be pretty close to any other Red Robin you are used to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville
Molly H.,"Colorado Springs, CO",83,91,24,3.0,1/2/2015,"Service is beyond mediocre. I was really disappointed in our server, who couldn't manage to bring my friend the fries or the ranch she asked for until being prompted to do so on three separate occasions.  However, with that having been said, the food and drink are Red Robin, meaning they're really good. I tried their Blue Moon/Svedka cocktail in a can, and that was the best decision I've made in weeks. Their Gardenburger is yummy and made even better with the addition of avocado slices. I do also love the concept of endless steak fries as well, as theirs are hot, crunchy, and well-seasoned.  Give it a shot. We were seated with a number of young children, so it's possible service was off-kilter because of it. The food is worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville
Tiffany G.,"Cameron, NC",0,22,24,3.0,4/21/2017,"First time here in about 6 years. The food looks great on the commercials but is just ok in real life. The atmosphere is nice, restaurant clean, and the servers were very nice and did their job. I got their burger with the egg on it. The egg was the most flovorfuk part of the sandwich. It came out room tempurture with floppy bacon. The worst part about the burger was the bun. Tasteless, dry, crumbly...like bargain bin bread that they sell when it's at the expiration date. Just not good. I give it on 5 stars on everything but the food. It was just ""ehhh"". And I don't know that that's a chef issue as much as it is a corporate recipe issue. Those are the buns they chose for that burger. Maybe a pretzel bun or a brioche roll would've been better. Go for the company.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville

Staff is friendly this is nothing against the servers I believe they are too understaffed to give you good service so it's not their fault.  The last 2 times I've been there has been on a weekend including holiday weekends Mothers Day & Memorial. They had 1 bar tender SERIOUSLY ??? The entire bar area has been full of dirty in bussed tables left purposely that way so people couldn't sit at them. That's a loss of $$$ so I really don't understand it. Plan better.  The last time we came will probably be just that... The last time.

Anthony F.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",84,380,130,2.0,12/2/2014,"After fighting our way through the Black Friday crowds, we had worked up quite an appetite.  My family and I decided a burger was definitely in the cards. And with this Red Robin location in the same parking lot as the mall, we wouldn't have to move the car through the killer traffic before eating. SOLD.  I went with my RR staple, the Bonzai Burger with bottomless fries and a strawberry freckled lemonade. The burger itself was totally fine, but the fries, which they're known for, were absolutely awful. They tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. I'm pretty sure I got the last remnants of the batch because on the way out of the restaurant, I saw some decent looking fries on other tables.  My wife ordered the chicken caesar salad and chicken-tortilla soup. The salad was pretty good she said, but the soup was terrible. It had also been obviously sitting out for a while, so the tortillas were completely soggy when it arrived at the table and there was hardly any chicken in it.  Service was pretty good, and the food came pretty quickly (which was surprising since it all tasted like it sat for a long time...).

Samantha V.,"Miami, FL",16,37,9,4.0,7/5/2015,"So I don't eat at a lot of chain restaurants, but in Fayetteville you don't have much choice.  The reviews here were pretty bad so we had low expectations, but were pleasantly surprised.  Honestly the service was fast, food tasty, and the prices are fair.  My one tip: get the onion rings!  The perfect mix of crispy breading and warm onion inside.  Soooo good!  The burgers were fine, you only get two options, a little pink in the middle or no pink at all.  Oh well, still tastes good",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville?start=40

Sometimes you get offered more fries, sometimes you don't.  I save this place for days when I am not starving because you never know. Back after 2 years some things just don't change .

They joked and laughed about the lights being out. We were seated almost immediately. At the table of our choice. Our server was training tonight so he was accompanied by another server. Our appetizer came quickly! Then our meal came. One burger was completely wrong. It took nearly 30 minutes to get it corrected. That's ever put it in the system wrong so the wrong burger came. When the correct order was delivered, I had already finished eating my meal. At the server blamed it on my husband for ordering the wrong burger....seriously!?!?!?

Marci S.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,18,3,2.0,3/16/2015,"We were craving a burger and weren't sure where to go in Fayetteville, so we opted for Red Robin. It was about 2:15 pm. Very friendly upon our arrival. We were seated at a small table when it quickly became apparent that this place isn't very well kept - crumbs everywhere, including on tables & seats; looked like it hadn't been swept or vacuumed in a couple of days. It was a beautiful day out, but it was definitely too cold in the restaurant. So we asked if we could sit outside and were told to go ahead out there. The waitress told us she would be right out. She never came out. Another waitress came over and asked if we'd been helped and took our order.  The outdoor section was also unkempt. One table not cleared after people had eaten.  Waitress was very friendly, took our order and came back with water. Food came quickly: I had the Red Robin burger and hubby had the Smoke & Fire burger. Both burgers were good, although hubby asked for his pink in middle and it was cooked all the way through. I had sweet potato fries and he had steak fries. Both came out cold, although mine were fairly crispy. Definitely won't be eating here again unless they clean this place up and serve their food warmer.

Tisha S.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,2,,1.0,2/17/2016,"For starters, I work at a local chain restaurant around the corner so I know how the business can go on behind the scences so I am not a typical ""entitled"" patron.  Ok, I hadn't been to this location in years and couldn't quite remember why not. My fiance kept bugging me about eating here so when we were in Raleigh the other day we dined in for lunch and both LOVED the food. We decided to go to this location in Fayetteville yesterday and I can now remember why I wasn't impressed initially.  Our servers name was Lisa? and she greeted us within a reasonable time. My fiance and I ordered the chilli cheese fries (which were actually good) and then the same exact thing I had ordered at the last location..the insaine romaine salad. It is two very large wedges of romaine heads grilled and drizzled with Caesar dressing and parmesan as well as a grilled chicken breast.  So here's the real review. As she was carrying the plates out I was just hoping that it wasn't our food. From afar it looked unappealing. She sets the food in front of us and it looks as though the cook got a little negligent with our lettuce on the grill, it was very scorched. Not only that but the lettuce looked as though it needed to be thrown out a week ago, it had so much slimy mushy parts. The chicken breast was so dry. I tried a few bites and was just over it as well as my fiance. Well there was no way to tell that to the server because she didn't come back to our table for quite some time. the same with the other location as well. (Maybe I'm a little biased by my restaurants ""3 minute bite check"" ) so we just ate it as to not be a ""bother"" or difficult. Nor did we want to wait any longer for someone to walk by. when she did come back I was a good way through the salad, but that's not why she returned. She asked if we were paying card or cash and if we were familiar with the tablet to pay on. I said yes and her response was something like ""okay! No rush I just wanted to make sure I didn't need to come back over here for anything"" ummmmm what???? Needless to say our drinks NEVER got refilled. And no she never did return...at all. These tablets are allowing the sever to become complacent and thats the experience from BOTH restaurants. I'm typically a very generous tipper as I know the struggle, even when they are crappy and I am teaching my fiance this concept. I literally give him a lecture every time. I didn't even bother asking if he tipped or how much as I was so disappointed that I could've cared less. We at least paid for the crappy food that's the most we owed them. I will never eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville?start=40

J K.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,19,,2.0,11/18/2015,"Arrived 3:00 pm 8-29-15. Hostess & Server were friendly & greeted promptly. Table was clean, but not seats, salt shakers or menus (quite icky). Burgers tasted like they are precooked over the flame grill, then just barely heated up to serve. 1 was ordered well done, and came out quite pink. Neither burger was hot (hence my theory of precooking and re-heating). The buns disintegrated before we were 1/2 done - I ended up using a knife & fork for almost 1/2 my burger. The fries were awesome, but it did take quite a while for the 'refills' to arrive. While the option of ordering via tablet looked interesting, I think that what it does most is to decrease the amount of attention servers pay to their tables. I'm not saying that is what happened this day, because our server did drop by a couple times, but I do see a potential for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville?start=40
