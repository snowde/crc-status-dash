Rina W.,"Federal Way, WA",0,23,6,4.0,7/1/2017,"Update: we went in today and we had great service! Marcus was awesome and he made sure we were taken care of. He was very attentive and was quick with everything. He was also super nice as well. Just because of him, we had a great time there. Will definitely be back because of him. :) They used to have much better service but now...If we could rate less than 1 star, we would. My husband, preschooler son, and our family friend had received horrible customer service. Staff was condescending, rude, and just didn't care at all... my family had to wait 45 minutes to even receive water or drink service. It took another 15 minutes to get the drinks after ordering it. Also It took over an hour to get their food. To top it off my husband saw the manager being extremely rude by talking to group of young Asian people like they are dumb. My husband couldn't stand the way the manager was being extremely rude and talking down at them.  When it was time to go, as my husband was not happy with their service so he didn't provide much of a tip...especially because he waited almost TWO HOURS to eat, from the time he stepped into the restaurant. The waiter made a rude remark about the tip, so my husband told him about the horrible service he had received, the manager (same one being rude to the Asian customers) came over and started talking to my husband condescendingly and did not even offer to make things right. If you're a manager, you should not be talking to ANY customers like they are stupid or dumb, and secondly don't talk condescendingly to customers!!  If you can avoid this location, AVOID, go to another location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=20
Phil B.,"Federal Way, WA",0,35,2,1.0,9/22/2017,"For many years, when Red Robin was pretty much it, we came here. Now they have competition and the service continues to get worse and worse. Walked in, sat at a table in the bar, waiting forever and no one waits on me. Move to the bar and wait and almost 10 minutes goes by and I have to flag the bartender down and he provides a smart ass response. If I felt like moving I would go somewhere else but this will be the last time I come back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=20

Lewis M.,"Hoquiam, WA",31,1,,1.0,9/8/2017,"The worst experience I've ever had at a Red Robin. Stopped on our way to a Mariners game, had a party of 7 told the hostess, she said 15 min, even though half the restaurant was empty. We sat waiting for about 10 minutes a party of 3 came in and was instantly seated, a few minutes later a second party of 3 came in and was seated, we were about to go ask the hostess what was up when she started counting out menus, so we waited. Then a party of 2 came in, she put down the menus and seated them in the bar, at which point we decided they must not want our business and left. One of our group went up and told the hostess that they had just lost a large group and she made an excuse about not having enough staff, but how do you have enough staff for 3 tables totaling 8 people and not enough for one table of 7?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=20
Lealoni K.,"Federal Way, WA",0,3,,2.0,11/18/2017,"I ordered a milkshake to go for my husband at home after eating there with some friends . They brought me a plastic cup that was only half full of milkshake and the other half was filled with whipped cream,and tried to say that this was right. I asked to speak with the manager and he brought a glass cup over and proceeded to poor my milkshake into the cup to prove me wrong. Granted it filled the cup but any other time we have gotten milkshakes there you normally get the metal cup too with the extra milkshake in it when you sit down to eat. I particularly didn't like that the manager just didn't take care of it, but felt the need to try and pass off the half filled cup as a full one when half of it was filled with whipped cream. It felt disrespected as a customer, by the manager. Also on a side note the server was nice but frantic and even told us that to get hours she has to rate a 9 or 10 on the surveys so she would appreciate anything we would do for her. Let's just say there was a lot of oversharing on her part.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=20
Kristin B.,"Tacoma, WA",23,15,,2.0,9/30/2017,"There was a really strange smell at this location.... it was a musty odor like that of a pet store, and there was a really strong fish smell coming from the kitchen. Not like a fresh fish smell, but more like raw fish left sitting out for hours and it overpowers you and makes you nauseous. I really wanted to leave a good review because our waitress was amazing and the food tasted good. But unfortunately, halfway through we were losing our appetite and anxious to be done because of the smell. Not sure if it was a cleanliness issue or something else, but it was disappointing. Hopefully management can look into it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=20
Cheryl J.,"Federal Way, WA",2,2,,1.0,8/28/2017,When you call in an order for pick up in an hour and they say they can either make it now and let it sit under the warming lights or we need to call back later.  What a bunch of crap. What ever happened to customer service?  How about write down the order and submit it 45 minutes later......the last time I was in this place our service was so bad it took over an hour to get 2 hamburgers and it was mid afternoon and hardly anyone there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=20
Pop C.,"Federal Way, WA",0,15,,3.0,12/11/2017,I really enjoy going here because my kids like it but they really need to clean the carpets or something because the smell in there is just terrible. I have been to other red robins that do not smell like this. Some of the hostesses could use better training such as maybe don't seat someone with a toddler in a booth where you can't have a high chair. Last time I was there my daughter found a piece of plastic in her mud pie. The waiters are really good they are quick and courteous and the food is decent. I have no problem getting fry refills or drink refills while I'm there,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=20
Debora T.,"Milton, WA",0,5,2,3.0,6/24/2017,Normally enjoy Red Robin restaurants but it's becoming a trend that restrooms are not a customer service priority.  This location had 4 stalls for women and 2 are currently taped off and out of service.   Ok but how about keeping the place clean and stocked ? Why do Red Robin restrooms always look like a bomb went off? #tukwilanotbetter,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=20
Kate H.,"Auburn, WA",185,900,77,3.0,8/4/2016,"The service was so-so. Restaurant wasn't too busy, but still had difficulty getting the service we usually expect at Red Robin. The server was training someone else, so we had two servers. They just didn't get it quite right and we had to ask multiple times for the same thing because between the two of them, they both just forgot. The food is pretty good and it was made to order with our quirky specifications.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=20
Jacqueline H.,"Sherwood, OR",0,1,,2.0,8/27/2017,"On our way home to Oregon we stopped here for dinner. It was by far the worst experience we have had at a Res Robin. We ordered a burger, a salad and sweet potato fries. The fries were cold and dripping in grease, the burger was good, and they brought us a BBQ burger instead of a salad. When the salad was replaced the salad wasn't cold and the toast that came with the salad was stale and cold. It seemed that all food items had been sitting for a very long time before they were delivered. Our waiter was friendly, however seemed annoyed when we sent back the burger for the salad that we ordered. The bathrooms were filthy and several stalls did not have toilet paper or toilet cover.  It was an extremely disappoint, we have never experienced a dining situation quite like this, especially at a Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=20
Ash C.,"Honolulu, HI",379,262,3613,4.0,12/30/2015,"There's no Red Robin (RR) from where I live but for some reason, they always show their commercials and I'm always catching myself singing the ""yummm"" part at the end lol. Talk about a big tease :( lol. On our trip to WA, my boyfriend mentioned there was a RR near where his parents lived. Knowing this information, I was determined to make at least one stop there. I've only been to RR once, but that was a long time ago when I was a little girl. So I don't have any comparisons to other locations to include in my review but I can say it's better than Ruby Tuesday lol. We came to this location on a Saturday afternoon. We found parking easily and we got sat right away. Sweet. Since I couldn't remember my last experience at a RR, looking over their massive menu was a bit overwhelming! Luckily I was there with my boyfriend and his sister who knew the menu a lot better than me. They pointed out a couple of their favorite burgers and mentioned that RR was also known for their unlimited bottomless fries that came with unlimited dipping sauces (only the Classic dipping sauces were free). Um say whaaaaaat?  Our waitress was nice, but service was a bit slow on her end. When we were ready to order, she was nowhere to be found. After we got our food and she placed all our dipping sauces in the middle, she didn't bother to explain which was which. And when we wanted to order more bottomless fries and more dipping sauces, we had to flag her down to get her attention. But regardless of the service, we still enjoyed our food. We all ordered their gourmet burgers and even though the presentation of the burger looked nothing like their picture in the menu, the taste was still there. I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ, and pretty much cleaned my plate. The bottomless fries were just alright. It wasn't as crispy as I usually like it, but the dipping sauce was what really made it delicious. The Campfire sauce was our favorite! Overall, my cravings were satisfied and I left happy :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=20
Angela M.,"Auburn, WA",125,77,31,4.0,2/19/2017,"Never disappointed in the food or service.  I will say that whoever designed the seating should be smacked upside the head.  If you are seated ANYWHERE in the middle of the restaurant, it is almost guaranteed that you will back into, walk into, or bump into another patron. That said, they have a wonderful array of gluten-free options - from salad to burgers.  My last visit I had grilled chicken on a gluten-free bun.  It actually TASTED like a bun.  Can't go wrong with the fries, but they have REALLY cut back on the portions.

Mary H.,"Tacoma, WA",48,14,62,4.0,6/8/2016,"This place is always hit or miss, but this time it was great. Our server was great and interacted with the kids. He was attentive without being intrusive. He was in a great mood, and it showed. At several times in the evening, my kids would catch him dancing as he served dinners, or cleaned off tables.  The food was good and cooked the way we wanted., and the drinks and fries never stopped coming.

Adel T.,"Auburn, WA",12,22,5,2.0,10/10/2017,"This Red Robin has gone way downhill. The once cheerful and fast servers have all left and replaced with people doing the bare minimum to keep their jobs. It's gotten slower and slower with every visit. Most recently I called in for a To Go order and it took them 5 minutes just to answer the call; after I placed the order - they told me it would be 20 minutes and an hour later I was still waiting for the food. Finally when it arrived, it was missing the extra fries I asked for and had to wait longer for them. All I ordered was two burgers. I don't know if I'll be coming back to this location any more.

The bathrooms have trash all over the place with papers everywhere.  Obvious it has not been serviced in hours, not sure if there's a manager on duty checking on this. 26 minutes to receive our boneless chicken wings and 1/2 order of rings.

Joaquin D.,"Federal Way, WA",4,14,9,4.0,7/11/2016,"I've been to Red Robin more than any man should have gone. But I go there anyways, and I have to say that my recent visit was amazing. This was the only visit that was this great. It was at a mellow time, so it was not as busy.  My waitress, Aubrey has to take the cake for this review. She was on top of everything. She was serving 3 tables at the time, but was on her toes the whole time. When our burgers came in, I'd let her know that we will finish our fries pretty fast, so she actually grabbed two fries trays right after she left.  She was on top of the drinks, questions, and everything. She got us a bigger size fry sauce when she saw us getting low on our sauces. Basically she was the top notch waitress. I couldnt ask for a better server.  Reason for a 4 and not a 5 is because the Red Robin always smells like dirty rag. I've been here a lot and every other red robin in my area, but this one seems to never get rid of the dirty rag smell. Sad, but server was amazing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=20
Edgar S.,"Auburn, WA",33,56,584,5.0,3/14/2016,"Been craving a good burger for a few days now so decided to visit the Federal Way location since it is the closest to our house. Walked in around 545ish to find the lobby a zoo :( luckily scored a booth in the bar which gf doesn't like but we didn't want to wait for half an hour.  Bill was our server and made this a 5 star experience, WAY to GO Bill! By far the best service I think we have had at a red robin even. From our initial greetings to our last farewell Bill was helpful, attentive, fast and pleasant. Ordered a sampler which we were informed a few minutes later that one of the items we requested wasn't available so we just more of Fried Zucchini . After demolishing out Mozzarella Sticks and Zucchini within minutes, Bill brought out the extra Zucchini that apparently we didn't get originally for our 3rd side. Recognizing that we wouldn't be able to eat our meals he offered to remove the 3rd side since it came out so late. Awesome! Of course, we stated that we would still pay for them if needed and he didn't want to have any part of that since we didn't eat them. A few minutes later, our meals arrived which were delicious. I had the same meal that I have had at a Red Robin for the last 10 years at least; Bacon Cheddar Burger - Well Done, Cut in half PLZ! Gf tried a new chicken burger which she liked.

Chris J.,"Auburn, WA",61,60,16,2.0,1/8/2018,"Delivered via Door Dash. I feel bad for leaving this low rating, but, it's deserved. Tonight we ordered 2 burger meals, a kids chicken strip platter, and an appetizer of Onion Rings. I also ordered a smoothie and a kids milkshake. Total, about $60.  Of course we didn't expect hot sizzling food, as it is about 10 minutes from Restaurant to home. However, I was told the smoothie and milkshake machine was down, so we would be refunded for that. Okay, things break, I get it. Anyways, I open the bags of hopeful goodness, and must say... It was not on par with what we get when we dine in. The chicken burger I ordered was good, but I think their fry machine must have been broken? They were overcooked, and I counted maybe 5 fries that would have been acceptable. It almost looked like we had some leftover fries thrown in our boxes. All 3 meals had what looked like a bankrupt burger joint portion of fries.  The onion rings are supposed to come with a dipping sauce, which didn't happen. And of course the food was cold, but we anticipated that while ordering for delivery. That's why microwaves and ovens are an essential part of our home.  Needless to say, our overall meals were not worth $60. I mean, for $60 I would at least expect some form of an attempt to deliver 2 quality adult meals, and 1 quality child's meal.  Sooooo... If you plan to have Red Robin delivered, don't expect 1/2 of what you would get dining in. I would suggest saving that $60, and cooking at home instead. Imagine the burgers and fries I could make for $60!!! LOL!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way
LeAnh N.,"Federal Way, WA",425,92,151,2.0,1/7/2018,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon and it is quite busy. As I was lining up to request a table, a man cut in front of me and the waitress helped him first. She then proceeded to take down my info with a frown and the way she talked was just monotone and unprofessional. After about 15 minutes we get sat between two crowded tables. The seating situation here is tight. They crammed all the tables as close together as possible to get the most tables in as possible. It's honestly a fire hazard. The two seater tables are so cramped you can barely fit anything on it.  After waiting about 20 minutes with no water and no waitress to help us I had to track one down to come to our table. She apologizes and proceeds to take our order anyways. After 15 minutes our waitress Kass finally decides to greet us and bring out some water.  Usually they bring out the fries first but this doesn't happen until she sees that we're a bit aggravated. The garlic fries are worth upgrading to,because the regular fries are a bit bland. Once the food comes out Kass brings out another lemonade, but fails to take the empty cup off our small table.  I then witness someone clean the tables super speedy but not very clean, even leaving behind a knife on the chair and a tie on the floor. I tried to tell him but he was in too much of a hurry because they're clearly understaff. Our food comes out and my Siracha mayo sandwich wasn't very good. My boyfriend orders one of their ""gourmet"" burgers which was just decent. Slightly better than Wendy's.  During the whole experience it was extremely hard to track down our waitress Kass. It felt more like a fast food restaurant, then a dine in. Due to the lack of service. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out, we did not receive anything close to good service.  I would only recommend coming here on the weekdays for bottomless fries and lemonade. Without expecting yummy burgers or good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way
Scotty B.,"Puyallup, WA",45,17,3,1.0,1/1/2018,"Wow. Parked and walked up to the front doors to an employee in uniform smoking a cigarette about 15 feet from the front entrance at the bottom of the stairs. Got inside, no hostess or anyone to greet me - and no one else waiting for a table. Waited for about ten minutes while being ignored by the staff with about a dozen other people filtering in for a table as well. Place not busy at all - when a hostess finally acknowledged me and tried to seat me I asked for a booth (the three directly inside the door were open), but annoying to her there was no server for that section; only tables were available. Meanwhile, every one else has walked out to go to the place next door. It was about this time where the hostess got into a disagreement with another hostess that had just walked in the door - leaving me standing there. Decided that this joint is an absolute mess - no sign of a manager conducting the team anywhere. Left and went to Applebee's in the same parking lot.

I can understand as it is hard to keep up with the times and stay relevant. I appreciate how other Red Robins have updated their buildings to stay current. This one however, has not. It looks like a relic from the 90s as I'm pretty sure it is. Food was pretty good and reminded me of childhood. I hadn't been to any Red Robin for 5+ years when they started jilting people on the not-so-bottomless fries. However this time they gratefully brought us more fries and didn't seem to be skimping to save a few bucks on potatoes. I was pleased! Love the amount of dipping sauces you can get with your fries.

The kids were fine and my mom and aunts nibbled a little bit .  Our waitress briana ? Pretty young girl with frizzy / curly hair . I'm not sure maybe she wasn't in the mood or it's her first serving job but our experience didn't make us hate the place, however ! I probably won't be taking my family out to a Red Robin for a long time . We've barely gone as is .  I Myself , not our waitress , felt the need to move most of our dirty dishes to the next table  for our desert .  I shared their new salmon burger with my cousin and it was dry and somewhat cold . The kids shakes and juice didn't  get to them until after everyone's dinner was out and we asked . Which would have been fine if the wait for our dinner wasn't close to 40 minutes .  It was funny that the waitress asked if we wanted a refill on our fries but we never actually got a basket . I wish she brought us more napkins in between dinner and deserts or napkins with our dessert would have been nice  As for desert we tried the brownie sticks and croissant donuts and to be honest both were not that great .  The young lady in red and black plaid , might have been a supervisor or manager was very nice when she helped drop off dinner . Made me feel like I was going to enjoy the sandwhich lol .  I left the minimal 20% . Would have left her more if she actually was more attentive and if the food was good .

Which I was not expecting considering my last experience (different location) took over 40min. This salad is off the chain I was in salad heaven everything was jus so perfect. I had to take half home due to the huge portion no complaints here I cant wait to eat the rest. Guest had the royal burger which was also cooked to perfection and fries were hot and fresh.

Additionally, I scanned my card several types and it never scanned, both my Royalty and debit card. Eventually the guy had to just do it on an actual cash register. Speaking of our server, he was not energetic like the gentleman who was helping others around us. It was hard to see him and it felt like he was avoiding us.

Inessa S.,"Auburn, WA",0,3,,1.0,12/29/2017,"Unfortunately, the service of Red Robin has only gotten worse and worse. Five years ago, we would come to Red Robin and they would load our table with bottomless fries and constantly come and refill. same goes for the drinks. Keep in mind that we've (our church youth) been going here at least once a month for the past 5 Years.  Last Sunday, we came in, our waiter (don't remember his name) didn't refill our fries a single time, only brought out 4 baskets, even though at least 10 people ordered items with bottomless fries, didn't even bring any sauces, came only once after to bring out our food, and when we asked for more fries, sauces, and refills for our bottomless fries, he nodded and never came back until he brought our receipts about an hour later (which he didn't even put in the system so we could pay and just leave).  Usually, we get about $50 in tips for our whole table for just an hour, but I can most definitely guarantee that it was a lot less than that this time. I don't understand why Red Robin puts new employees as waiters for a party of 14-20 if they just started working there.

Bruce F.,"Milton, WA",69,632,210,2.0,10/8/2014,"This is probably the worse of all the Red Robbins in the area - at least half the time we have issues.  Today - lets see where to begin.   First they had one gentlemen handling at least 5 tables that just sat down - we had 6 people at ours - too many tables for him - they need to get someone at the front who knows how to space customers out. We got our orders and asked for our soup to come first.     Finally I asked where our food is and he went and checked.   -  Everything came at once - the cold soup - the cold burgers - the cold mac and cheese, etc.    I am guessing he was not doing his job and checking and the soup had been sitting up there for some time - followed by the food. I had him replace the soups - but we were now getting concerned about the time - took too long - so ate the cold food.     Kids asked for refills on the Mac and Cheese and again waited and waited.   I finally went up to the counter and asked the first server I saw - should I get our food that is sitting there or can you bring it.   (Obviously she glared but brought it).    Our table had no attention paid to it - how is the food, etc.  No refills of drinks - anything we needed I had to flag down someone.  At the end I talked to the manager and he took care of the bill - letting us know his store is #1 in the area - really - hard to believe. The manager did take care of the whole meal and - while we appreciated the free meal - we did not go our to get cold food for free.   As I said this is not the first time this has happened.   Usually we go to the Red Robbin in Auburn - 100% better managed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=60

Inga D.,"Federal Way, WA",18,3,1,4.0,10/26/2014,"So, with this review I will add a photo.  Let me first start it off by saying that good service goes a LONG way. Very, long way.  We ordered an appetizer which was the fried zucchini and mozzarella sticks. They were pretty good. My spouse and son enjoyed their food and loved every bit of it. My son had mac and cheese and my spouse had the reds big tavern. I however was going to have a salad, but was won over when I saw the photo of the DGB burger. It sounded absolutely phenomenal. Fresh Arugula, garlic aioli and a nice angus beef patty. All on a ciabatta bun. Well... It was everything the photo showed besides the fact that it was completely raw in the middle. The outside however was VERY crunchy and burnt. I'm going to safely assume that it was made on a very high flame. Anyways, I tried to eat around the raw burger but couldn't do it. I ended up losing my appetite and hardly had any of my food at all. I ended up waiting for the waiter to come and take it away. I explained to him the situation, now here's where they got four stars. I know mistakes are made but when the manager himself comes by to apologize for the burger and explains how those patties are a lot more thicker than the regular burgers and are a little tricky to make. It was nice that he did that, but then he removed my burger from our bill, offered me something else on the house, which I didn't want because my appetite wasn't there anymore. So he proceeded to then to tell me that he will also take off 50% off the new bill. Which was our appetizer and my sons food and my hubby's food. Our bill was a total of 10$ I was shocked that they went out of their way to make me happy. It was nice that they admitted to their mistakes and did what they could to fix it. Not many places do this instead they just give you a small discount off your bill and send you on your way. And never apologize. I will be returning to this red Robbin, mostly because of the good service I was given.

I ordered ice water and the California chicken burger extra pickles crispy patty, he got the a1 burger extra mayo with onion straws on the side and a strawberry lemonade.  The cooks took a good half hour to prepare our meal. I was a little pissed. Our fries were slightly cold, the burgers were great aside from the fact that they forgot my pickles, and didn't put mayo or onion straws on his order. The waitress was sweet and apologized and brought us everything we needed.  Overall it wasn't my best red robin experience, but the food did the job. Not sure if she heard me complaining but I was really pleased that the waitress came back and apologized, she sounded really sincere which is why I give them 3 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=80

Scott S.,"Bonney Lake, WA",6,76,3,2.0,5/21/2016,"The food was slow but tasted ok. The problem was the overcharge--I had a double burger, my wife ordered the smallest burger available, and they brought both 20 min after ordering (which took 10 min to get help). Food was ok, warm, good taste. Fries very good but portion small. The reason for the low rating came with the bill--my meal was $7.99 and my wife's ""smallest burger in the house"" was $8.79?  We brought this discrepancy up to the waiter, and only got a shrug. We brought it up to the manager on duty ""Drew"" and got the same shrug with a weak excuse of ""we take a normal size burger price and take a $1 off""...except my double was 80 cents cheaper than her ""cheapest burger in the house.

Melissa C.,"Federal Way, WA",179,112,113,3.0,3/10/2015,"This place is my go-to restaurant when I'm craving a burger and fries. The food is good but the customer service can do some improving. Every time I eat here with my girlfriend, the waitress will serve us our food and about five minutes later when me and my girlfriend are about to take our first bite, the waitress stops by to ask how the food is and never comes back until she hands us our check. This has happened almost every time I've visited. And I visit about a couple times a month. Considering I used to be a food server, here's a tip for red robin's waiters/waitresses: ask your customers how the food is AFTER they've taken a bite of their food. And check up on your customers when they're about half way finished!  Also, I've noticed recently that if you have bottomless fries, they literally serve you about 5 fries each time.

Cameron K.,"Federal Way, WA",1,6,,2.0,7/3/2016,"So it was lunch time one Saturday and we decided to go to Red Robin. We usually go to the one in Des Moines or the Auburn one by the Supermall. But unfortunately we somehow decided to go here. The restaurant is terrible. I know this isn't the restaurant's fault, but it seems like this is the place where stressed, inexperienced, new mothers come to get a drink with their crying children. But the reason the restaurant ACTUALLY sucks is the cleanliness of the place. After a huge group of people left, some kid who kept running around and climbing on tables left his BBQ stained napkin on the floor. So fifteen minutes after they left, the minimum wage 16 year old still didn't pick up the floor. We had to use chairs to block our sight of the floor because it was just too disgusting. The person I went with had ordered an avocado croissant sandwich. Well it had no avocado, no mayo, no mustard, only ham, lettuce, and tomatoes. Turns out she got someone else's meal. The manager delivered the actual avocado sandwich, and while he was here she asked him how often they clean their floors. Prepare yourself. ONCE A MONTH! Disgusting. The only reason this place has two stars is because of our waitress that we weren't supposed to get, Denise. If the owner or manager or whoever is in charge is reading this, THIS WOMAN NEEDS TO RUN THIS PLACE. She was absolutely the best waiter I have ever had. She is so friendly and so kind. Took great care of us. Her alone gave this place that 2 star instead of 1. And with that, my review is done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=80

He spent 20 minutes trying to fix the stupid machine to pay for our meal as opposed to giving us a paper check, all because he claimed he would get in trouble! Than he gets to our table smelling like he just ate a pack of cigarettes!! I wish I could say this was our only interaction with this unwilling and uncaring human, but unfortunately we have had many experiences with Lester and every time has been an extreme let down.

Kii S.,"Federal Way, WA",58,124,861,3.0,3/1/2014,"Been here a few times now.. and while service can be hit or miss.. I still can't get myself to really like this chain either. I'm never impressed with their burgers. I think it's their buns that I'm not a fan of; which in turn for me.. makes me not like the burger itself. Their buns feel like they are flaky and end up falling apart, so ya.. total turn off. If I have a burger; especially while dining at a sit down restaurant, I want my burger bun to be substantial and to be able to hold up and not fall apart like their buns do here. Came here recently and while the other people I dined with got burgers.. I got a cup of French Onion soup. Their French onion soup was decent and it had gooey, melted provolone on top! It had plenty of onions inside and a nice beefy, oniony broth.  As for service, we were greeted and seated right away, but I think the hostess was a bit clueless when it comes to the fine art of sitting diners. She basically ended up slamming our server with too many tables thus she was running around like a chicken with her head cut off. Our server did her best to handle the situation and given that she probably had one or two too many tables given to her, she stepped up to the plate. After we gave our orders I knew right away our server was slammed.. and we even overheard the manager telling the young hostess that she had given our server too many tables. I don't come here too often and when I do.. it's usually by someone else's suggestion. If you don't mind somewhat over-priced burgers and flaky, fall apart buns, you'll be fine. The plus side.. they do have bottomless steak fries, broccoli, and sweet potato fries with your burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=80

We get there the menu has changed to all burgers barely no entrees. The service was prompt and we got the chicken wings and salsa dip for appetizers. So it was about a handful of chips and a ketchup cup of salsa for a party of 6. Let me not forget to mention she brings us 3 plates? Then we get the wings and the taste like they had been frozen 30 minutes ago and then left under a lamp for 28. I order hot tea and don't get any sugar for like 16 minutes later since that's how long it took for the waitress  to check back in. We get our food and before I even tasted my sweet potatoe fries I knew they were stale. I tasted them and sent them back immediately, Which I never do. She forgot to bring our kids drinks. My asiago chicken wasn't on chibata bread which I specifically asked about and  was like that on the menu. So we were just sitting there looking at microwave food and trying get on with out lives. So we visit the restroom at some point in the evening only to be further disappointed by the absence of paper towels and seat covers.

As to the food... they don't seem to mind special orders and carry gluten free buns which are few and far between for most other burger joints. If you are a frequent diner here it's worth it to sign up for their royalty club where you get a free meal on your birthday, $20.00 on your 6th visit and every 10th burger is free! The only issue I have is that they recently changed their salt and pepper shakers to those little grinding mills which can be a bit of a challenge for some of the older folks and/or those with arthritis. I'm not quite there yet myself but I've seen a few struggle with them.

I came in on 12/16 for dinner with three others.  It took too long for the waitress to take our orders but I didn't think anything of it at the time.  However, when she didn't bring or offer more fries, never refilled my soda, didn't bring napkins, and didn't clear plates the benefit of the doubt went out the window.  She gave us a sob story out of the blue when she came by to   cash us out.  We were in the middle of talking and then she came up to the table and started talking.  We stopped our conversation.  She was telling us how she was ok, things would work out, even though her life was hard.  What?  She then told us that she was trying to cope by being at work.  One of my friends, trying to show sympathy, said that sometimes work helps one deal with stress.  The waitress agreed.  There was this weird, awkward pause.  Then the waitress said she would cash us out.  Oh I get it!  She wanted a big tip for her bad service.   Red Robin has mini kiosks on the tables now that you have to use to pay.  The waitress showed my friend that graciously offered to pay the tab.  She hovered over her while she tipped her.  Not cool. My burger was fine.  Someone ordered a cup of soup - come on girl, don't pretend you don't eat.  My other friend got fish and chips and the other person ordered a burger.  No one complained but no one said it was good either.  Half of my fries were hard as a rock.  It would have been nice to get more fries.   When the server brought the food, she set all of the sauces on the edge of the table, away from where we were all sitting instead of taking two seconds to ask what sauce went to what person.  Don't be lazy, do your job.  It's not hard. The acoustics in this RR is bad.  We couldn't hear each other without speaking loudly due to the noise and large open space.  I've been here on a night when you can hear each other.  And no, none of us are losing our hearing. Saw a lot of people waiting for a table when there were booths and tables empty next to us.  Not a fan of that situation.

He was super gracious to my mom, who is not very tech savvy, and their tablet payment system. The food came out delicious and 100% as represented on the menu. The only thing knocking this down from four stars is that the bathroom definitely needs some updating, and had a stale bathroom smell. The other is that they had run out of the coloring menus for the kids, which meant we had to otherwise occupy our kids. No big deal, all told, but everything else was well executed.

After the 2nd one she came and asked if we needed anything else I asked for another basket. She then said something like okay Ill go get your last basket. Wouldn't give us any more sauce either. Then brought the check and said have a nice day.... I wasnt done though!!!! Kind of frustrating especially given how much the check was.

So we sat the table, for a waiter to come out telling us a man was sitting there that had just gotten up.. Umm okay so is he coming back? Did he leave? What?

I am a frequent Red Robin customer and I have tried this location three times because it is the closest to my house and all three times I have been extremely disappointed. I will not be back. The restaurant is dark, out dated and dirty. The floor has food all over it like it is halfway vacuumed maybe once a week. The food has literally come to our table with a hair in it. This last experience we walked out before even ordering due to the cleanliness of the restaurant. The table we we sat at was wet on one half from the dirty rag wipe down and food left on the other half from not being cleaned. My wife had to bounce back up after sitting down from sitting in water and I had to get napkins to wipe the salt and chunks of food from the seat on my side. Trying to push past all this at the beginning I then had to separate the sticky pages of the menu..... Ok, had enough of the review yet? Right? That's about the point I just decided to say, no thanks, we are leaving. I like Red Robin. Most establishments are pretty typical, this location clearly lacks the strong management that is needed to keep a restaurant clean and respectful. This place is surviving on the mall and freeway location. Sad. Updated this review (all written above) from a two star to a one star. Against my better judgment on my previous visit, my son wanted Red Robin and since it had been over a year since my last review I thought I might be able to play it safe and get out unscathed... WRONG. it was an utter failure that ended up not paying for one of the burgers and the app that was just deplorable. I'm done. Not headed back unless I have been told management has been changed and the restaurant is attempting to head in a new direction, until then I will visit the other Red Robin locations if I feel the need for Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=40

My husband and I love their food and it's one of our first choices for dining out. However, this has to be my least favorite location. It's regularly crowded and sitting in the bar dining area has proven to receive slow service for the most part. The last time we came in I ordered a salad and half of the ingredients were missing. It's a salad I order regularly so I certainly noticed, but the server/manager actually argued with me on what comes on the salad (read your menu, dummy). Also the service has been really bad in the dining area lately too. The stars of this restaurant are Marsha (I think that's her name. Asian lady who has worked there a long time and very sweet) and the hostess Rae, she makes me smile the instant I walk in and talks to me like we are best friends. Love her.

We waited five minutes and still nothing. Then a gal came up and took our appetizer order and drinks and before I could finish ordering she ran off for another 5 minutes. Um... OK! I was so hungry and it was my birthday meal. I wasn't thrilled as this seems to be a continuous theme. I almost called over the manager. She mozied (spelling?) on back and asked if we were going to order anything else. I said I tried but she walked away. She said she was sorry busy running around. If you can't handle six tables, perhaps this isn't a good fit for a Friday evening in the bar as a server. Eh?  The great thing, which I will give her credit for and giving her a tip when she was losing points at the beginning.

We had one waiter - Sean - the entire time, and he was amazing. We all ordered the silly cocktails and some apps and fries (I love those gorram bottomless fries) and we never noticed a wait. Our drinks came out fast and our food quickly. Sean took our separate checks without a single error, and he never broke a sweat with our huge group. As for the food: The cocktails (I had the red zombie thing) were a little sugary, but I expect that flavor at RR. It wasn't shy on rum though! I ordered the chicken caesar wrap for lunch and it was the perfect amount of food. The wrap was tasty, and the fries were just right. Good Job, Red Robin. You guys handled that impromptu birthday party like champs. And best of all: no singing! We never got a birthday choir of servers and waiters, and couldn't have been happier about it. Awesome.

Not to mention, the bottomless fries and a strawberry shake on the side on a sunny day? Man oh man.

Lisa P.,"Seattle, WA",13,120,21,3.0,11/2/2012,"I love burgers. It's the to-go food for every American, yet I usually don't order burgers at Red Robin. Up until recently, all I would ever order from Red Robin is the Buzzard Wings, and of course, their Fickle Lemonade. With the new addition of their Red Tavern Burger, I find myself ordering burgers again. Truth be told, the other burgers they offer are just too big for me to finish, but the portion size of their Red Tavern Burger is just right. With the addition of a strawberry milkshake and extra crispy fries, Red Robin provides that retro atmosphere with their saturated vintage art decor, bright lights, large booths, and red sticky seats.

Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals...I heard no complaints....I had the ""Red's Nantucket Seafood Scatter""...fish, fried shrimp, and clam strips.  I only got one small piece of fish, but it was good, the fried shrimp was good, but the clam strips had absolutely no flavor of clam....all I could taste was breading.  Bottomless steak fries and strawberry lemonade can't have a stick shaken upon.  Tried my mom's riblet...good sauce.

Liz P.,"Federal Way, WA",109,7,,1.0,1/27/2016,"We were at the Federal Way Red Robin last night for my son's 5th birthday. As I child we loved coming here for birthdays, awesome food, the birthday song with the balloons and HUGE Sunday (always with whip cream and sprinkles and a cherry on top) I also remember standing on the chair and wearing a mask or something of the sort. Last night was probably one of the worst experiences at Red Robin I have ever had. We had a large party and John, our server seemed pretty new. First off the location was out of three different beers, Stella, Sierra Nevada and one other. This took us about 20 minutes to find out as we ordered one, then the other then the final. Which we were aware wasn't the fault of our server but when  the first beer of choice was gone he probably should have found out which beers were available on tap, not make the person ordering find out in the period of 20 minutes. Another person finally after 15 minutes went to the bar to pick up her drink she had ordered. Everything took a really long time. We finally ordered around 7, 30 minutes after arrival. Food arrived around 8, there were 10 meals ordered, 3 of which were for children. Multiple items were wrong, I received the completely wrong burger and my sister in-laws was supposed to be a turkey burger. She sent hers back and I just ate what was given to me. Hers came back about 15 minutes later (which we were surprised it was so quick). Fries were cold, my burger was lukewarm and one of our milkshakes ordered was the consistency of heavy cream. We were there for a little over two hours. We received our check then I asked our waiter if they would please sing to my son. A Sunday came about 10 minutes later that looked like it may have been prepared at 6:30 when we arrived, it was less thick than a milk shake. There was no candle, no whip cream or sprinkles. It was a very sad evening and I am extremely disappointed in our choice to have our son's birthday her. Red robin, I would now say, is consistently less than mediocre across the board.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=140

The food was also outstanding.  I had the Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich with cole slaw.  I love how you can substitute a salad or cole slaw instead of fries for no extra charge.  The fries are also unlimited - they bring you small portions (which is great); and if you want more just ask - they promptly bring you more fresh, hot fries.  The margarita's were good too - more than just a mix, they did pack a punch! I don't know if all Red Robin's are this good, but this one really knows how to give great service, great food - and all on a very busy Saturday evening.  I was very impressed and I don't impress easily.  Great place for a family with kids - or without kids!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=140

Both really great! and super accommodating! Denise, reminded the girls of a grandma type always making sure everyone was fed and happy. We just love it!

We get a seat in the main accessible area.  It is such that the wheelchair sticks out and is about 24 inches from another customer's chair.  Everyone has to go sideways by you.   Luckily it is back close to the kitchen so not too many people are discouraged by the blockage.   Good service, Excellent blue cheese burger (I can't remember the exact name), but it was hot, quick, good taste, and with the normal Red Robin quality fries.  My wife had the Tavern Burger on a wheat bun with a salad, all of very good quality.   Actually the buns were a little oily (slippery to the touch).   The stars are for the food, If I would just rate the food and table service I would probably rate it a 5.   Accessibilty and knowledge about accessing the restaurant is a zero.  I hope the designer of the building is unemployed and I would like to see management spend some time in a wheelchair, and then train the staff.    I have been to a lot of Red Robins but this layout is horrible.  (I am from Oregon, and they have a wonderful location and layout at the Red Robin in Bend)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=140

Robin P.,"Tacoma, WA",2,17,2,4.0,3/20/2012,Usually great service. We let them know when we area in a rush and they have always been prompt. Only bad thing we ever had was the soup.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=180
Tiffany N.,"Seattle, WA",56,105,1254,2.0,8/15/2011,"I'm a fan of Red Robin in general, but this Red Robin always seems to be strange in the service department the past few times I've eaten here.  The servers seem stressed out at all times, even if the restaurant isn't very crowded.  The restaurant itself consistently smells strongly of some kind of chemical, almost like the gross air fresheners in some public restrooms - you can really smell it if you sit at the bar.  On the positive side, the food comes out quickly.  I would prefer going to the Southcenter Red Robin than this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=180
Otto R.,"Puyallup, WA",204,456,209,4.0,8/23/2008,"Red Robin. Those guys make it impossible to eat healthy.  They do have a new Customizer on their website, Basically you can make your meal anyway you want it.    But its time consuming trying to figure out what each item has in terms of calories/fat etc.  I wish there was just a list. But you can definitely find some good things. Go for the whole wheat bun, grilled chicken, add some veggies on it to make it a full burger. Ditch most of the sauces (mayo, honey mustard), ditch the cheese and ditch the tortilla strips. Also for salad dressing, they do not have anything light.  Even their balsamic vinaigrette had 200 calories and 15 grams of fat. For sides go for the steamed veggies or the melon wedges. :D I had the Jamaican Jerk chicken, only thing I had to remove was the cheese and the mango mayo.  And replaced the fries with melon wedges. Bam, reasonably healthy dinner!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=180
JoAnna L.,"Nashville, TN",141,375,430,4.0,7/12/2011,"Ate here a little while ago to take my Dad for an early Father's Day. He loves Red Robin. We decided to sit in the bar area and our drink orders were taken quickly. I ordered a Coke and my Dad got a coffee (which he said was good). He then had the fish & chips, as usual, and I had the chicken tortilla soup with a side of flat bread. Our server was nice and very attentive. The place wasn't too busy and I was glad because my Dad hates to wait. I'll be back again when I'm in the mood for some soup or maybe their bottomless steak fries :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=180
Rhea T.,"Tacoma, WA",37,29,4,3.0,8/7/2008,"I think I'm being too generous with my rating here, but eh, whatevs. In high school, Red Robin was the hot spot. I guess times have changed. Don't get me wrong - RR is still a pretty popular place as they always have a wait - but the quality of food just isn't the same anymore. I don't know if it's me - I mean, it has been OVER 10 years since high school - or what, but the last couple of visits, I just found the food to be very mediocre. And it didn't come out fresh, either. What gives, RR? I do, however; love their bottomless fries and the fact that you can have a screaming toddler and no one really gives a rats arse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=200

Should have just shared a meal with little one!  Total with tip was $28 (we just had lemon water to drink).  I usually end up paying around $50 for lunch by the time you add an app and a drink and am upset when I leave but not yesterday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=200

Diana C.,"Auburn, WA",0,1,,1.0,5/26/2013,"My husband loves hamburgers and my kids love Red Robin, I however am not a fan. With that said Red Robin has been a place we go about once a month or so. Lately the Federal Way Red Robin has turned out less than satisfactory food (my husband no longers enjoys it) and the service is awful. The last two times we have gone large parties were the priority and our table of 5 has been ignored. My rule there is if you don't have your drinks within 5 minutes of being seated get ready for a long wait on your food too. If you live in the Federal Way area its worth the drive to the Auburn Supermall to go to the Red Robin there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=200

Travis C.,"Wallace, ID",0,15,2,2.0,4/6/2014,"Usually Red Robins are pretty predictable, not today.  We waited about 10 minutes to be seated, requested a booth for our 2 little kids, they attempted to seat us at a square table, a nice couple volunteered their table for us, it was nice if them.  We ordered and requested some fries while we waited and waited, kids milk came,fries came.  Still no drinks,finally got the drinks,  drained the coke waited for our food,  no refill, still eating. Started eating the whiskey river BBQ wrap.  Tortilla was like eating rubber, kept waiting for someone to come check on us, nothing for 10 min-  we saw the couple that moved for us with a partially eaten wrap too-same issue-rubbery. Finally asked some one to contact our server, asked about the food-he runs off to the kitchen before I could finish-the kitchen said it was fine.  No response to my feedback or the neighbors food issue.  and I still have an empty coke.  I don't fault these guys but the should acknowledge my concerns. I left the plate in finished, never did get the coke refill and extra fries I requested for a refill.  We will not be coming back here.  Given it was a Sunday and they were reasonably busy.  My wife's food on the other hand was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-federal-way?start=200
