Bonnie P.,"Rotonda Heights, Rotonda West, FL",46,18,,3.0,8/6/2017,My burger was super great. What was piss poor was that most of the beers they had posted were unavailable. They did not even have an IPA on tap and I think they only had two craft/ish beers on tap.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-flint
Rod W.,"Oakley, MI",4,164,187,4.0,10/31/2016,Theo our server knocked it out of the park with superior service and an upbeat and positive attitude. You could tell he really enjoyed his job. He made the birthday boy in our group feel extra special and the sundae he gave him was a good size. The fries and nachos were good. The burgers are consistently average for the price and value. There is some down fall to the loyalty program and as a result we have loss some offers but they also lost us as guests a few times.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-flint
Sara S.,"Fenton, MI",406,528,2023,2.0,4/19/2016,"In a nutshell- Chuck E. Cheese-lite. The service can be described as lackadaisical, at best. If you're excited about the idea of bottomless sides i.e. unlimited fries, don't be, because the staff is none too keen about accommodating you. They actually seem like they're on a mission to see just how many people they can stymie in their tracks from asking for that elusive bottomless fries refill. Definitely odd. Every time we've eaten here, it's been underwhelming for one reason or another. The food is alright, especially for a chain. The bottomless fries are actually really good, salted to perfection- so good, in fact, that you want that promised refill. Good luck getting it.  The last time we dined here, we had to practically beg someone- anyone who was working, really- to grab some for us, as well as drink refills and the check. Our server had done a disappearing act. She should go on the road and headline in Vegas with that one. We never saw her again. Nope, she just disappeared into thin air. Did she leave out the back? I don't know. She never said she was going on break or that her shift was ending. I found that rather peculiar. Thus far, I've had the fish and chips and a gourmet veggie burger. Overall, the food was relatively solid, but the service has been horrendous. My veggie burger was fine, but the fries are what sealed the deal. The arctic cod was alright, particularly for a chain, but not terribly memorable.  Again, the fault was with the service each time.  Why were they mopping the floors and closing off sections three hours before closing with a dining room that was at least half-full at the time? I found it disconcerting. To me, it screamed ""get your food and get out now,"" in a not-so-subtle way. I seriously thought they were about to close and then realized they were open for another three hours! What gives? As for the ambiance, it's not that different from Chuck E. Cheese. I swear, it's so loud, with screeching three year-old's in high chairs, indifferent parents and blaring TV's overhead. I could have done without the noise and practically non-existent service. I will give them this- it is pretty clean, but that's probably because they clean all the time, including when the place is full. Beyond that, their wi-fi is slow. It was hard to get a decent signal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-flint
Amy H.,"Bancroft, MI",2,28,18,1.0,5/19/2017,"If you are making salads here you need some serious retraining. 1st if you would not put a rotten old piece of lettuce in your mouth then don't put it in my salad.  Every salad should have fresh lettuce not looking like it just came out of the trash or been sitting in your refrigerator for a few weeks. If you have hot chicken don't put it on the cheese, no one wants melted cheese on their salad. If it comes with ""toasted"" bread then toast it. Really it's not rocket science. Whoever is managing needs to wake up. Sick of bad food I'm paying the money for you to do your job! I want fresh food and people who have common sense making it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-flint
Julie D.,"Flushing, MI",9,12,2,3.0,8/29/2016,"Red Robin - Please fix your Insane Romaine salad. I've had it twice...the first time it was too small of a portion, but cooked well. The second time it was so huge (a full head of romaine cut in half and put on a small plate), I could barely cut it without everything falling off the plate. The the bigger problem was that is WASN'T grilled, as the menu claims, it was just served raw.  On the good side, the fries are almost always good, and we love them with the campfire sauce. And, my family members who get burgers are usually satisfied.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-flint
Jacob S.,"Perry, MI",0,3,,2.0,5/29/2017,"This is one of my fall back restaurants when nobody can agree on where else to go. I'm typically happy with my experience with Red Robin. However, I am quite disappointed with my visit to this location. Slow waitressing left us staring at the bottom of our ""bottomless fries."" And when my meal was brought to me, I was missing the side and had to remind the waitress before it was brought to me. All of this would be understandable if we had been there during a rush hour and almost every table was full, but we were accompanied by only a few other tables of people. The food was great. I just wish it had gotten to me easier and faster.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-flint
Chris M.,"Tampa, FL",85,13,,1.0,5/13/2017,"The food was decent but the service was awful. The waitress was friendly and all but she barely could keep up with our drinks for a table of three and she only had two other tables. She even admitted that she was drunk and getting ready for Saturday night early. My brother was also mad that his favorite part of the meal, the ranch, was not delivered with his meal. Poor service overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-flint
Gina M.,"Flint, MI",19,121,,1.0,2/21/2017,"Unfortunately for a place that raves gourmet burgers, my boyfriend & I were severely disappointed.  We will never go back, as the burgers were the greasiest we've ever had & the wait staff was pretty slow.  You're much better off going somewhere else for a decent burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-flint
Sharina J.,Metro Detroit,213,272,172,2.0,2/18/2015,"The Bad: Gave up on free refill of fries after twenty minutes.  The waitress asked the kitchen three different times for more fries.  She then told us there was no use in her saying anything because they are just getting mad.  She also informed us our fries refill was the only ticket up there.  Hmmmm maybe the cos should go somewhere else if they don't want to cook? Waitress kept sweeping around us while eating and it was really annoying.  We asked if she could sweep after we were done since she was within two feet of our plates.  Not sure if she didn't hear us the two times we asked or if she was just mad at the kitchen because another table was complaining about their fry refill.   The Good: Our burgers was excellent!  I also opted for the freckled strawberry lemonade with unlimited refills, although I did not get one.  The restaurant was not busy since we dined after the lunch masses...around two pm.  The whole restaurant is wheelchair accessible except no low seats at the bar.  If you want bar specials and are a wheelchair user the manager can adjust your bill (did this for us on previous trip).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-flint
Sandy R.,"Swartz Creek, MI",1,2,,5.0,10/6/2016,"Crystal our bartender/waitress was so nice. We were so busy talking and forgot to look at menu, she was so kind about checking in on us.

Ben H.,"Flint, MI",148,195,499,3.0,10/29/2015,"Pretty average. The food is okay, nothing special. When it comes to the so-called ""bottomless"" refills, don't hold your breath. I wouldn't say they are too keen to refill anything for you, be it drinks or fries. I had a chicken wrap, which was pretty good, not knock your socks off great. The ""unlimited"" steak fries are quite good, however, make no mistake, they aren't really unlimited at all. I've noticed during my two dining experiences here that the servers are hard pressed to make eye contact with the customers and they seem to enjoy cleaning around customer tables in a not too subtle way hours before they close. They do that when they aren't chatting with other employees while drinking sodas at an empty booth! We had to flag down at least two different servers to attend to our table while our waitress disappeared to who knows where. I've had  one of their burgers before, but I wouldn't claim it was a gourmet burger, although it was a-ok. The service is rather inattentive and could use some work. Other than that, the atmosphere is overwhelming kid friendly, which means there will be rowdy youngsters and families in abundance, so beware.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-flint
Dana S.,"Livonia, MI",30,45,,4.0,11/12/2014,"Solid place.  The family and I come here quite a bit and I don't think we've ever had bad food sent to us (pretty good for a chain restaurant).

Jeremy R.,"Waterford, MI",64,209,245,3.0,7/1/2014,"This location is conveniently located along Miller Road - so if you are out in the area shopping, it's easy to make your way to this Red Robin. When we arrived we were told there would be a 10 minute wait.  Not a problem.  We were seated abut 15 minutes after getting there.  When seated we noticed several open tables that we could have sat at.  Maybe they were short staffed and didn't want to fill all the tables... I don't know. We ordered the half order of wings and chips.  Man, these chips are amazing.  Too bad the order was kinda small.  Also, 4 wings didn't really do much, but hey... it's an appetizer so we didn't expect much. Before the dinners came, we decided to try the skinny drinks - My wife tried the Skinny Stoli Raspberry Lemonade and I tried the Skinny Absolutely Absolut Freckled Lemonade.  Remember not to push the strawberries in the freckled lemonade to the bottom of the glass because they do clog the straw. :)  These were some very good drinks! Now for the entrees.  I enjoyed the A1 Peppercorn Burger wrapped in lettuce (looked like they gave me half a head of lettuce) and with bottomless broccoli.  My wife had the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap with bottomless broccoli.  Both were very tasty and prepared just as we ordered them.  Mine was extra enjoyable because I am part of the Red Robin Royalty program which gives you a free burger on your birthday. All in all, this was a good visit. This location is a little dated on the inside - the fry ceiling fan blades seem to be hanging down pretty bad and the floor has seen better days.  Bathroom was pretty messy here too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-flint
Ann R.,"Davison, MI",2,32,8,4.0,3/5/2016,"I have to say the burgers were very good. I had the blue ribbon burger I substituted the veggie patty it had a great taste. My dining companions had the whiskey burger he thought very juicy cooked to order could have used a little more seasoning, bun was perfect it held the sandwich together. My other companion had the crispy chicken sandwich good crunch very juicy. Overall good experience good service, gave it 4 stars I found it a little pricey for 3 sandwiches.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-flint
Joe S.,"Midland, MI",67,15,1,1.0,5/17/2015,4 diners + 1 cold order of fries = unacceptable! Bottomless fries??? It takes way to long to deliver so you can only get a second order before you leave so this needs to be fixed my dear Red Robin!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-flint

Alisha J.,"Davison, MI",1,8,4,1.0,8/3/2015,"Seriously, DO NOT EAT HERE. Worst service I've ever experienced. The waitresses are the worst, they all just stand around and talk while tables are sitting around waiting. And when you do finally get one to your table they are there so quickly you can't even tell them everything you want. They act like your bothering them. This is my second terrible experience at this particular location. They have no urge to work or be friendly at all.

Rosemarie C.,"Howell, MI",1,30,15,2.0,3/21/2014,"I have been to many red robins in the past and have always had a positive experience. However, my visit to the red robin in  Flint was less than enjoyable.  My husband and I went out to dinner with our friends and their two young children. We were promptly seated and our server got our drink orders and then our food orders. She then can back to say that the milkshake machine was not working, but that it should be back up shortly. About 10 minutes later she came back to say that she didn't know when the machine would be working, and that we most likely wouldn't be able to get our milkshake.  The two small children were getting pretty hungry after 15-20 minutes of waiting for our food... Our server came over and brought us some free fries and apologized for the wait. About 10 minutes later our food came. I was given fries instead of vegetables and I let the server know.  I was brought vegetables, cold. Then I realized that my burger did not have the fried onions that I paid for on it. I caught the attention of another server  and she brought took my burger and brought it back s few minutes later.  Overall, food was ok but it took forever and was not as I ordered it. I would not return again. Go elsewhere!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-flint

Thomas B.,"Grand Blanc, MI",23,209,53,3.0,3/12/2015,"Tonight when we visited this restaurant location, it was very busy and there were people waiting for tables.  Of course my wife and I chose to sit at the bar and eat and not wait...   Prompt service was given and I was shocked to see new burgers on the menu approaching $15  OMG!    Both of us stuck with the $6.99 double stack cheeseburgers.. and we ordered some chips with some zesty dip as our starter and we also shared some stackable donut like dessert.  The burgers arrived not cooked and we were not in a hurry so we sent them back and they eventually arrived cooked much better..   Fries are always solid and fortunately endless... I liked the chips and the dip but was very impressed with the salsa.   Its been a long time since I have experienced better flavored salsa...  The donuts were just okay but hey we had to use up my entire $25 gift card from Christmas.   Ironic that my boss actually wound up paying for my dinner on my last day of work lol    IF not for the rare burgers and the time it took to bring them back out to us,  we would have given this review four stars instead of three.   Maybe next time.......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-flint?start=20

My daughter who can be picky never has a problem deciding what she wants and the sides they offer are healthy. Bonus! I like the Royal burger with the fried egg on top. Delish. I love the fact that you can choose to have a side salad or their steak fries. It works for us because I get a salad and can have some of hubby's fries. And he can always get more, which we usually get a full order to box up and take home.  I've also gotten the clam chowder and it's divine. So creamy and smooth with lots of clams.
