Brian L.,"Cincinnati, OH",18,29,11,5.0,11/22/2017,"One of our favorites. Great kids menu. Gluten free buns for the burgers.  Each table comes with a slightly outdated iPad sort of device. For $2.00 the kids stay entertained and you don't have to look like those parents that always have an iPad babysitter.  You can order drinks from the iDrunk app. And when you are so drunk you fall out your chair from all the on demand drinks and iPad babysitter, they have art on the ceiling!  They thought of everything.  Love this place!  Good food also.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-florence
Matt M.,"Florence, KY",26,234,4848,4.0,1/4/2017,"This was the restaurant we ate at for our anniversary. Visually it doesn't have anything that really differentiates it from other restaurants. Just an American casual dining restaurant with a bar and some televisions. The folks were friendly as well so let's get to the food.... Tower Of Onion Rings Turbo-Q Tavern Double Burger  What Is It: The tower of onion rings is 13 onion rings stacked up on a tower thingy and comes with campfire sauce and ranch. The burger comes with pepper jack cheese, caramelized onions, chipolte aioli, and triple s (bbq) sauce. Presentation: I love the look of the tower of onion rings as that's one of the more brilliant ways to present onion rings I've seen. The burger looks like a burger.  The onion rings get a perfect 10 for that presentation though. 6 for the burger.  Taste/ Final Analysis: The onion rings had a real nice coating on them both texture wise and taste. The campfire sauce was okayish but needed a little more kick and a little less sweet in my opinion. The ranch was like any other ranch and was fine. The burger was a very high quality burger. The meat itself was flavoured well as well as cooked properly. It really needed a lot more sauce on it to be a turbo anything. I think it was on the sweet bbq side but there wasn't enough in there to really even get an accurate reading. They did have a lot of pepper jack cheese on there to help with  the flavour but stop skimping on the sauces!!! Tower Of Onion Rings: So freaking cool and delicious out of 10 Turbo-Q Tavern Double Burger: 5.5 out of 10",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-florence
Patsy H.,"Bridgton, ME",7,28,13,3.0,9/18/2017,"It was National Cheeseburger Day and we decided to come here. Both of our cheeseburgers were well made and tasted great with just the right amount of char, yet still juicy. I loved the smoky flavor!  I had steamed broccoli instead of fries--I'd have preferred it with some butter and they would have brought it if I'd asked, but I opted to take the healthier route. Still was good. Bar service was a bit slow which was odd since it was a slow Monday. However, the drinks were fine. We'll come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-florence
Ken B.,"Cincinnati, OH",84,184,150,3.0,2/24/2017,Had not been to a Red Robin in a while and the wife and kid was all in for it so off we went .  The place was clean and looked fun and the servers were nice and good. How ever the food just did it seem to par.  My wife's burger was on the burnt side and I had to eat half my burger before I even tasted the guacamole that was on it.  The sweet potato fries and milkshakes were good. Just the burgers seemed to be lacking,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-florence
Grady M.,"Hebron, KY",3,28,47,3.0,8/30/2017,"I stopped in Red Robin to have a burger for my birthday. I think that it's great that I get a free one every year. We were greeted at the door right away and the host was very pleasant and friendly. He said that he was going to be our server but they switched in the middle of dinner but it was still no problem. When I got my burger it was cooked perfectly but my fries were cold. Well, somewhat warm I guess. I informed my server and she took care of it right away and brought out fresh ones in just a few minutes. I used to really enjoy Red Robin but the atmosphere seems to have changed along with the decor. I really liked the way that it used to be and I guess that's why I only go in two or three times a year now. I do think the prices could be a little lower, but I guess you pay for what they call atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-florence

Julie E.,"Independence, KY",0,18,5,2.0,11/23/2016,"So hubby and i went there for lunch. it wasn't crowded. The waitress was nice.  I had hoped for a restaurant with a bar, but the RR in Florence was more like a bar with some food.  I ordered the Guacamole bacon burger with fries and a drink. Hubby ordered just a soda as he wasn't hungry.  On our table was an mp computer trivia game that hubby found quite entertaining. He played games while I ate.  The burger and fries were okay - nothing to write home about or make me crave another trip to the restaurant. not 'gourmet' as advertised. I can make a better burger on my grill at home.   The floor was cement and not exactly clean. the table was wobbly. The kicker came with the bill - $23.99 for 1 burger & fries combo and 2 sodas.  OH and the trivia game had a $1.99 surcharge that the waitress *didn't* mention. bottom line?  WAY overpriced for what you get and not mentioning the trivia game surcharge was obnoxious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-florence

Sarah H.,"Covington, KY",147,223,122,4.0,9/11/2015,"Update: We did go back and I realized I have to substitute a sirloin burger for the regular burger that they use. There is an up charge but it really makes all the difference. The other burger just tastes low quality but the sirloin is awesome. And definitely try a milkshake to finish your meal! ""I wasn't overly impressed with my burger (the guacamole bacon burger), but my fiancé absolutely devoured his (the smoke & pepper burger). Even the meat and bacon on mine seemed to be a lower quality than on his. I know his is considered a ""specialty"" burger but as I'm paying $12 for mine, I still expected it to be a damn good burger. Instead, it was just meh. My guacamole was brown. The bacon was thin and chewy. My mac & cheese was really good, if not a little too cheesy. The fiancé got the pumpkin spice milkshake which tasted exactly like pumpkin pie. It was delicious. We will probably be back and I'll have to try my luck with a different burger. The service was okay. Not overly good, but not bad either.

Geri L.,"Dry Ridge, KY",23,41,4,1.0,12/2/2016,"Went there last night for supper. When we got there, they really weren't busy but Trump was in town & interstates were closed. By the time we left, they were hopping. It was our first & probably our last time there.  We asked for a booth & was seated in the bar area in a half booth, half table, this was real nice, but it was near a door & I had to put my jacket on as I got cold. We also told our waitress this was our first time there. She suggested our appiterzer of onion rings. We got an appiterzer of a short stack onion rings. They were good & the dipping sauce was very good. My husband ordered a simple burger & was told lettuce, tomatoe, onion & pickle were on the side, along with steak fries. I got a bacon peperjack cheeses burger with steak fries & ranch dipping sauce. When we got our burgers, we were hungry & ate them. Our waitresses checked on us several times. But quite frankly, the gourmet burger it wasn't. We both had to look for our burger. For the burgers to be 1/3 if a pound, I expected a thick juicy burger. The lettuce, tomatoe & onion for my husband was next to nothing. When we went to pay, the waitress asked if we had loyalty card, we told her this was our first time here, she skipped the loyalty card & went right where we paid. $40 for two flat non tasting burgers, steak fries that were all right & pretty good onion rings. For this price, we could have gone to a steak house & had a better meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-florence

Wanting to try something new we thought this would be a reasonably safe bet. The restaurant was clean with fun decor and unlike some other reviewers we had excellent service. The freckled lemonade was delightful and came with free refills. I ordered the whiskey river chicken while my partner for the tavern double. Both were very tasty and you can't beat bottomless fries!

Charles S.,"Fort Mitchell, KY",18,151,5,4.0,12/29/2014,I recently stopped in and bought a big sky burger and it's my favorite burger there now. Definitely try that one and don't worry the Sriracha isn't too strong. All of the burgers come with bottomless fries but I've never had room for additional fries. The salads are ridiculously large. Unless you need those extra fries it's a bit expensive just for a burger. The service is always pretty exceptional here and last night was no different. Our waitress had a table next to us that seemed like a handful and she handled it really well.

We were seated with a very short wait at a table that matched our need for seating.

Yes yes yes!!!  This was my very first time at Red Robin because I don't generally like to go to chain restaurants for burgers (one of my favorite foods!).  I came here with a group of 25 for a friend's birthday dinner.  I ordered the mushroom burger which I was disappointed with.  I ordered it to be cooked medium but it came out pretty much well done.  Also, it was underseasoned for my taste.  The steak fries were amazing though, but who can really mess up frying french fries?   The service, however, was top notch!  The waiters were very attentive and quick.  They noticed almost immediately when a drink was empty or when an order of fries needed to be refilled.  This was especially impressive with the large party I was with.  They were also very gracious in printing out separate checks for each of us.  Absolutely wonderful service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-florence?start=20

Additionally, in terms of the service, they are always quick  and attentive about refilling your drink the moment it gets low. Pluls, they're always so friendly!

Geekar L.,"Brooklyn, NY",86,320,1195,4.0,1/8/2013,"It's the closest RR, but still quite a drive away. I come here every time I visit Kentucky and I'm talking 2-3 times during one visit. I can't shake their bottomless steak fries paired with their seasoning! The service is always great and they check up on you without overdoing it; they bring more fries when you're almost done and the same goes for their bottomless drinks. My most recent visit I had the RR cheeseburger, which was pretty good. I also got the Freckled Lemonade, yum!  I also really like their bruschetta chicken sandwich and love their mint brownie shake. The towering onion rings is heavy stuff, but good and worth a try, at least once. The spinach and artichoke dip is pretty good too.

Andrew A.,"Las Vegas, NV",55,96,59,4.0,5/9/2015,"Great concept of having bottomless fries with your meal. I have been to RR a few times and it depends on who waits on you as far as your satisfaction. If you have to wait for the fries to be replenished at the end of the meal then it's useless to have bottomless fries. I had this experience once at RR. Another issue is the replenishment of drinks. If you get halfway through the meal and your drink is empty, you have to wait until your server notices that you need  a refill and your food may be cold by the time you get a refill to wash the food down. I like the food and the concept(s) of free refills however this has to be sync'd to work.

Donielle W.,"Covington, KY",82,151,12,4.0,1/6/2012,"I really like this place. So far I've been twice, and both times the food was great. The first time I had the Red Robin Gourmet Cheeseburger which was a really good burger! My husband had the Bacon Cheeseburger and he really enjoyed that as well! For an appetizer we had the Game Day Nachos, which was also really good. The second time I went was during happy hour so the appetizers were cheap. Since it was so cheap, we decided to have 2 appetizers because it never hurts to have leftovers, and that way we could try more things. We had the Cheeseburger Con Queso & the Triple S. Riblets. I really enjoyed the Cheeseburger Con Queso, but the Riblets... not so much! They were too sweet and I just didn't care for the sauce at all. Plus the price was way too high for the amount they give you.  For my meal I had the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap with a cup of Potato Soup. Both were really good. My husband had the Whiskey River BBQ Burger which he also really liked. Over all the food is really good, but it is overpriced. The burgers are about $9.00-$10.00, and although they do come with unlimited refills on fries... the fries are just okay, and the burgers are so big that I would never get a refill anyways.  They do have a Red Royalty card though that's perks are pretty sweet so it kinda helps make up for the overpriced food. You get a free appetizer that has to be used within 14 days of registering the card. You will also get a free burger during your birthday month. There are also other deals like buy 9 burgers get the 10th free.  I also enjoyed the fact that when I bought a couple of gift cards from here for Christmas, I got 2 free 5.00 gift cards for myself. Overall I give this place a 4. I'll definitely go back. I would give it a 5 if either the price went down a bit, or the fries got better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-florence?start=40
Jay H.,"Florence, KY",270,235,175,3.0,9/7/2011,"For the longest time could not figure out what was going into the corner of Hopeful/ Houston rd and 18 next to K-mart in Florence. I was thinking it was going to be a Ruby Tuesday for the longest time, then they finally put the sign up. Red Robin. I said""great can not wait to to there"". first time I ate at a Red Robin was up north off of Union-Cincinnati Day rd in Ohio about 3 years ago. Was very impressed with the food.  So we go there a week later when it opened. It was packed. I ordered the egg on top of the burger, it was not bad. The endless fries were ok. The service was great. Really like the ambiance. Busy busy busy. Would probably go back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-florence?start=40

Mike W.,"Park Hills, KY",93,121,,5.0,3/7/2011,"I had been playing Angry Birds on my Droid on our way to Red Robin, and it really got me thinking - there should be some tie-in between the two. I hadn't been at a Red Robin in nearly a decade, and have yet to get a chance to eat at the one that just opened in the area. So, there was certainly no objection on my end when we all decided to stop in. Teenage Weg has fond memories of chomping down on a burger with mozerella sticks on top. 'Cause that's how I roll. Sadly that burger no longer was on the menu, so I went with their Mushroom 'n' Swiss offering. I really like Mushroom 'n' Swiss burgers. For me their scale does not go from Bad to Great, it goes from Awesome to Phenomenal. This burger was in the phenomenal camp, if only because they had about a pound of shroomy goodness on it. (Which actually was the name of my hippie cover band during my ""wild days""). If you like mushrooms, you'll have a good time. They're kind of love it or hate it food, so I'd imagine you'd dislike it if you're in the latter. My only minor gripe with the whole experience is that our server was super, super helpful. Way too helpful. ""Are you sure there are other customers in the restaurant?"" helpful. No exaggerating, she probably visited our table six times after receiving our food to see if we need anything. I guess if there's any problem with a restaurant, ""Too concerned with needs of customers"" is a pretty good problem to have. So no points docked from them for now, but if it were to happen again I'd consider it. So yeah, Red Robin. Good stuff. It's gonna be a thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-florence?start=40
Stephen G.,"Cincinnati, OH",22,128,,5.0,4/19/2012,"Yelp is all about personal opinion and my personal opinion is that in the land of family-friendly chain restaurants Red Robin is king, reigning over mere proletariat pretenders to the throne. Somehow, they always seem to get it right, from the very first impression as you walk in - bright, colorful decor, friendly faces to greet you - and right through the whole concept of proper customer service and the dining experience. We have visited a dozen or more Red Robins across the country and it's difficult for me to fault any of them... and regular readers of my reviews will know I find fault easily! The attitude must stem from the top down and it shows in the response of the servers. Always friendly, generally willing to joke and laugh and work with whatever quirks you might have. For instance - and I don't know if this is the result of my European upbringing - I refuse to eat out of a basket when eating at a proper restaurant. To me, eating from a basket reminds me of standing in a motorway lay-by in the early hours of the morning chucking a greasy kebab down my throat to soak up the effects of too much alcohol from the night before. Now, some may be happy to eat a $10 'gourmet burger' (Red Robin's specialty) from a plastic basket, but I always ... ALWAYS ... request to have my food placed on a proper plate. And a server has never raised their eyebrows at me, or questioned my decision. Now, granted, they may have gone back to the kitchen and shouted ""the English twat at table 37 wants his burger on a plate"" but I personally have never felt embarrassed about my quirk. So kudos to the staff for that! Then there's the food itself. They have managed to concoct some spectacularly-tasty burgers in the time we have been going to Red Robin, but for me their Whiskey River BBQ Burger certainly takes some beating. A couple of years ago - when I was on a temporary bread-free diet and tried this option - I asked for it to come in a lettuce wrap and for whatever reason it has made the taste even more powerful and scrumptious and now I always ask for it that way. The lettuce seems to add a marvelous level of 'crunch' to the proceedings, setting off the crispy onion straws and various fixings just perfectly. (As always, and dependent on your taste buds, your mileage may of course vary) And then there's the fries. Bottomless steak fries, never stale, fresh and always cooked to perfection. I eat too many of them every time. They may be bottomless but I am certainly not, the size of my rear end growing larger with every visit. I am somewhat thankful there is not a Red Robin within easy walking/driving distance of my home, otherwise I would be a regular customer at the Big & Large shop and ordering my pants in a size with way too many X's. All because of the yummy fries. It's not the only menu item that is bottomless... they do something called a freckled lemonade - a blend of real strawberries & tangy lemonade - which will be served to you until your bladder is ready to unceremoniously go bang. The phrase ""sugar rush"" doesn't even match the initial sip and it won't take long before you're bouncing off the walls. There's lots of cocktails too. And beers. And desserts. And onion ring towers. And they do a mean cod & chips which surprises me with its fresh taste given we're usually some 1000+ miles from any coastline. It's a perfect place for families and seems very kid-friendly indeed, younger diners offered their own special menu at keen prices. My advice would be to sign up for their Red Robin Reward Card which you show to the server and which not only gains you a free burger for every nine that you buy but gives you a free burger during the month of your birthday. Plus, as I found out earlier in the year, you might also find yourself with a free birthday sundae to share with your guests at the end of your main meals. Be warned however, that you may also be sung at by all the staff, so there IS a price to pay for that sundae! Yummmmm! indeed!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-florence?start=40

Jamie M.,"Harrison, OH",3,8,,3.0,7/25/2011,"Went to this Red Robin location last night with a friend. Food was good and loved the Very Berry Raspberry Limeade- not too sweet, tart and refreshing on a super hot evening. DJ our waiter couldn't do enough for us. Attentive without being over bearing. I rated this as A-OK, just because I'm not a huge burger fan. It was good but not like awesome so I've not rated it super high. Was very pleased to see I could get it w/o the bun- since I'm trying to make healthier food choices. Pleas don't tell me how much sugar is the the limeade- it will ruin all the pride in not having a bun. DJ (our waiter) told us their shakes are to die for, can't attest to that but the person next to us seemed to be enjoying one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-florence?start=40

My husband couldn't finish it & took almost 1/2 of it home.  The Southwest grilled Chicken Salad was a lot smaller, actually, perfect size for a lunch salad.  We were very surprised/impressed.  For a chain restaurant, this place is pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-florence?start=40

Glenna M.,"Elsmere, KY",16,46,20,4.0,4/8/2012,"Annoying commercials led me to avoid this place for so long. I was wrong. Red Robin is a good time. The food is consistent and good. Not fine dining, not even really creative, but it's good every time and when it's not they take care of it.  My recommendations are the Grilled Chicken Alla Caprese Salad, the sweet potato fries and the veggie burger. That Boy is a fan of the regular cheeseburger and the chicken tenders (not shocking to anyone who knows him). We also love the endless steak fries.  The service is usually attentive and fast. Especially for a chain. The tables and restroom are always clean and usually the wait isn't that bad for a table. The one time my order came out wrong my server quickly replaced it with the right dish and it was taken off our bill completely without even having to ask. That kind of service is what encourages us to return here. I also suggest getting the Red Royalty card. After 9 entrees you get one free, you also get a free burger and fries during your birthday month and other surprises throughout the year. The volume in the place can get kind of crazy as it is a family place and there are always kids there screaming and running amuck. So be prepared for that.  So, if you're stuck for a place to go in the Florence area, check it out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-florence?start=40
