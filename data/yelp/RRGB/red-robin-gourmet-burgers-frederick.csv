Kay S.,"Frederick, MD",4,39,52,4.0,12/31/2017,"Fast & casual family burger joint! Always a winner ! Went out on a limb this time and created my own burg. The ciabatta roll is pricey but saves you 70 calories and really fancies up a classic burg. I also added a fried egg-cooked perfect. I forgot to order my burg pink-my own fault-but still it came out super juicy for a no-pink patty! Donte was out waiter and did a great job keeping up the bottomless sweet tater fries (not pictured because consumed too quickly!) lost a star for price. Having to pay extra for every single little substitute (bun, egg, sauce, sweet taters) is obnoxious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-frederick

Taylor T.,"Harpers Ferry, WV",0,1,9,1.0,12/16/2017,"Walk in on a Saturday night not very busy at all after shopping at the mall. Where do I begin....service was horrible, manager horrible! My mom said straight to the manger when checking on us ""You suck, your kitchen sucks"" The manger said I quote so very rudely ""So I suck?"" My mother ""Yup."" As manager if you don't have any integrity when why are you still working as a manager. Okay let me tell you horrible bathrooms,horrible manager took criticism personally he just didn't care,server was pretty good, food was okay not horrible but not the best. It's sad you can't even go to a nice bathroom there was paper towels on the floor and toilet paper everywhere. Food my bun was soggy I had the Chicken Bruschetta Sandwich it had three spoon fulls of onions to many way to many onions.

The service was terrible, the attitudes of the staff were just unbelievable & the burgers sub par. We never returned. That was a year ago. I coach basketball & the team wanted to have our end of season gathering at RR so I figured I'd give it a second try. I called a day ahead and asked if I could reserve an area for 30 people and was told flat out NO.

Dave L.,"Frederick, MD",1,34,,1.0,8/19/2017,"Not a good sign when, on arrival, you (and your fellow diners) grip the booth and surrounding chairs to avoid slipping on the greasy tile floor.  My ever-observant wife noticed the intersection where the wall meets the floor was shiny and the lower wall was discolored from what looked suspiciously like mold.  We arrived. We were seated and ready to order.  No problem with the drinks & we then placed our order.  Then the wait.  At this time you would think the wait staff would provide our silverware and napkins... an oversight, it happens.  We wait.  The observant-one sees that one of our gluten-free burgers is sitting out, waiting for our server to deliver.  We wait.  My wife's tension rises, and when that happens, tension ions are flying like crazy - even a neanderthal like me notices.  We wait.  We call the waiter over and he confirms that, yes, our one burger is sitting (5 minutes now), because they can't find a gluten- free bun for the other burger.  He will see what's up....we wait.  He returns and apologizes.  My wife instructs him to serve the complete meal and the other burger, bun-less.  He brings half the order.  We wait.  His manager brings the other half and apologizes. We have to remind our server that we still have no silverware and napkins.  We wait.  Finally, with utensils we commence to dine.  Food:  Burgers too cool and old, shiny cole-slaw and a salad that was was just fine (whatever). After waiting for just about everything during our meal, we did not wait to pay - thanks to the neat electronic pay box at our table.  We steeled ourselves to slide out without falling.  Admittedly, Red Robin is not the restaurant for us, we should have known better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-frederick

Over the course of the meal He dropped off 2 tiny plates with about 10 fries each. Hardly ""Bottomless"" They didn't wear hair nets in the kitchen and one girl working had long hair down to her butt flying all over as she moved around. One other lady was playing in her hair before taking food off the counter to serve. You are better off going somewhere else. Oh ya, best part...they had ""Beast"" on tap for a beer selection.

The Mac and Cheese my kids got looked like it had sit in the heating window for 15-20 minutes.  I ordered the Signature Smoke and Pepper. That signature must have been in crayon and done by a 4 year old. Ive had this before and it had never looked like this. The cheese was almost melted off of the burger. Like it was put on the meat 2 minutes before going on the bun. And the bacon looked nothing like real bacon. It was microwaved bacon with a sorry attempt for peppercorn crackles. The fries were old and when I asked for my free refill I received only 6 fries (my kid thought it was funny that he could count them).  And by the time I saw my server again my kids were ready to go home.

The sauces they come with are good. My mom and I both ordered the Tavern Double burgers. Food was good, the fires were hot.  The only downside to the experience was the waiter.

Keisha C.,"Frederick, MD",7,50,33,2.0,3/29/2016,"I have received a Red Robin Loyalty Reward for a free burger on my birthday (3/17). On March 26, I have decided to phone in my order and picked it up at the RR by the FSK Mall.  When I got to the restaurant, the lobby where the hostess was standing behind the podium had a really funny smell. After I told the hostess that I was going to be picking up my food, she told me to sit at the bar and the bartender will get my food for me. No problem. I sat by the bar and watched some college basketball. The atmosphere of the restaurant was okay, but the smell from the lobby was approaching its way into the dining area. The restaurant was full, as it was the evening and it was Easter eve. Also, the bar was very clean, free of dirty plates and glasses.  When my food was ready, the bartender gave me my food which was neatly placed in the box with some fries. The gourmet burger I ordered was the Whiskey River BBQ Burger. I ordered that particular burger because I really wasn't feeling the other burgers that were on the menu via RR's website. As far as the fries, I felt that if I redeemed a free burger for my birthday, then I should've gotten at least 2 or 3 handfuls of fries. As far as the burger, it tasted good, except that I had to scrape the shredded lettuce because it looked and tasted soggy and I did not get a tomato in my burger. Overall, this place gets 4 stars for a nice interior, including the bar but 2 stars for the smell of the restaurant, soggy lettuce and no tomato. However, I will come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-frederick

Michelle h.,"Frederick, MD",28,37,32,4.0,5/22/2017,"We returned at urging of management to give them another try. We found service much better this time. Travis was our server. He was friendly and attentive. Food and drinks arrived promptly. Food was good. My husband and boys loved their burgers. I had a salad and enjoyed it. Glad to see management has made changes for the better! Horrible service. Our waitress was nice enough and trying but they were short staffed in the kitchen. So management sent her to the kitchen. So we never could get anything we needed. Plus saw at least 3 managers walking around but none offered any assistance. In our section a man at another table even stood up and yelled ""can we please get some service"". A manager looked at him and then walked away. I don't fault our server at all, this is a clear failure of management. If you need to put a server on the cook line, assign her tables to someone else. Don't just leave customers with no server.  The food is barely mediocre. My chili cheese fries were burned and the chili tastes like dog food.  Won't be coming back until their Yelp reviews improve indicating they are getting their act together. Used to be a decent place to go, but based on the other reviews and our experience they have gone way down hill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-frederick

Rizma W.,"Washington, DC",106,591,510,4.0,6/12/2015,"4.5 stars, for fantastic customer service!  Kudos to Kristen, the manager at this location. From the moment I stepped in the door, she  was super helpful. Her hostess was swamped, so she stepped right in to seat me.  I ordered a Western BBQ burger with sweet potato fries and a Freckled (strawberry) lemonade. I noticed the burger was taking a little while, but I didn't think much of it. A minute or two later, it arrived. It was huge! Really tasty too... a little to much ""char"" on the edges for a medium-well burger, but still very good. Wouldn't go as far as calling it ""gourmet"", but it was a satisfying lunch.   My sweet potato fries were limp and cold, but before I could finish my first fry, the manager showed up to my table with a fresh, piping hot basket of sweet potato fries. She explained that she accidentally sold my burger, and that they had to make me a new one, which explained the wait. She said she also ""didn't like how my fries looked"" on my plate, so she took the initiative to bring me some fresh ones. She really didn't have to do that and I was really impressed at her level of attention to detail.

Pink or no pink. Sad. Really sad. I like my burgers med rare at most and was not an option. Servers where milling about doing nothing. Got father in laws order wrong. How hard is a hamburger with just mustard and onion?  Had cheese and lettuce and tomato. When asked to fix it they did but had another one out within 4o seconds. Fresh made, probably not. Final straw was the fact that the servers don't even take payment. Pay on tablet left at table.

Maria P.,"Colesville, MD",336,175,348,5.0,7/12/2013,"I must say, Red Robin is definitely living up to its hype.  I walked in expecting it to be slightly dirty and full of greasy men chugging beer...but it was the exact opposite. The crowd was a mix of families, friends, and older people enjoying some delicious food while watching the huge TV. A young friendly host brought us to our table and it only took a minute for the waiter to arrive. Extra points.  After looking at the menu for about 15 minutes (the abundance of options made a selection very difficult), I settled on the guacamole bacon burger. Now, let me point out that its a general rule to never mix meat on a burger. I think it's strange and takes away from the entire burger-eating experience.  Thank goodness I broke that rule.  The guacamole bacon burger comes with a grid of bacon (yes, grid) that's perfectly cooked over as many patties as you'd like. I chose ""no pink"" because in the event that  meat does enter my mouth...it shouldn't be moo-ing.  It was love at first bite. All the toppings (lettuce, tomato, onion, and guac) blended together perfectly. The crispy fries were a perfect compliment to the burger, especially after I sprinkled their special seasoning and ketchup all over it.  My only complaint? That I didn't ask for it on a whole grain bun.  They also have a variety of salads and wraps for ""healthier"" choices.

Nicole O.,"Germantown, MD",3,15,,1.0,9/30/2015,"They started separating parties with kids to one part of the restaurant away from other guests.

Nobody at the host stand. Weren't approached until 5 minutes later. But prior to finally being approached, I saw management and other employees from a distance see us standing there and didn't let anybody know nor come up and approach us. The place had about 5-7 tables sitting down and there was only one server on. Never saw any other employee help him out or take a table for him. Looked like an every man for himself deal.  Got approached 10 minutes after sitting down since the server was overloaded with tables. Our servers name was Matt Cluckey or something like that. Thank god for this guy cuz he made everything better. Took care of us and made up for everything.  Final thought- for all those that didn't acknowledge us when we walked in, don't make me feel uncomfortable coming in during the last hour of operation. Your open. I'm a paying guest. Don't treat me like I came in 15 minutes to closing. And I heard from across the restaurant that our server had to remind the kitchen that they're still open and that there was food to be cooked.

It lost the Friday's or Chili's vibe which is where it seemed to wanted to be going in too. They took away the Happy Hour after 8 pm which is a small perk when get off late from work and wanting to have a reasonable priced beer and watch the end of a sports game. They cut back on the selection of alcohol to a bare minimum. I am fine with the changes if they would just choose what direction they want to go. Only other change which seems to be the norm is that all apps and drinks are ordered on the touch pads.

Sam C.,"Frederick, MD",6,38,,1.0,12/16/2014,"Since its grand opening a few years ago, the Frederick Red Robin has been locked into a tug-of-war battle with the Germantown location for the title of ""Shittiest Franchise in the Red Robin Chain."" And while the Germantown joint is slightly ahead (based on my last miserable experience there), Frederick is fighting hard to reclaim its rightful crown. How will they do it, you ask? By continuing to serve up undercooked burgers, flavorless watered-down drinks and shakes, cold (recycled?) fries, and nonexistent service. And I think this may be their year! Admittedly, I'm a glutton for punishment. Despite repeated abuse at the hands of incompetent cooks, witless managers, and a team of indifferent waiters, I keep going back. I know, I hate myself for doing it, but it's my memories of a better Red Robin from long ago and far far away, one with fantastic food & friendly staff that have me trying again and again to relive the great time that Red Robin was meant to be. Alas, I'm in denial. I refuse to admit to myself that this restaurant is so poorly managed and so dreadfully staffed that it's incapable of delivering the goods; i.e. a pleasant dining experience. During my last ordeal an impatient waitress took our orders and then disappeared. She never came back. Nearly an hour later an overgrown teenager wearing a black shirt (a manager perhaps?) stopped by the table and offered us refills on our drinks (the first and only time that night), but no explanation regarding our missing waitress. Did she go home for the night without handing us off to another server? Was she ok? ""Was the food ok?"" ""Can I get you folks anything else?"" These questions were never asked or answered. To answer them... who knows, who cares, the burger was grossly undercooked, and I would have liked a refill on the fries. Not that any of it matters since later that night I was doubled-over on the toilet, shitting my brains out. They advertise bottomless fries, but fail to mention the complementary E. coli that comes with your entree. The Red Robin concept, when properly executed, is awesome.

David D.,"Frederick, MD",0,7,,4.0,5/21/2015,"Time of Visit:  May 21, 2015 at 11:45 am My Order:  Bleu Ribbon Burger                      Steak Fries                      Peach Iced Tea Total Rating = 3.9 (Four Stars) Red Robin is, of course, a large chain with many locations.  I visit this location often, as it is close and you can get a good meal.  I'll admit I made this trip because I'm a member of their Royalty Club and I had a free burger coming.  Because of that, I ordered a burger I had never tried before, the Bleu  Ribbon Burger.  Although the food didn't score exceptionally well, the non-food factors bump up the overall rating. Location and Access, Overall Rating 5 The place is real easy to find, just off I-270, right at the entrance to the Francis Scott Key Mall.  It's situated across the parking lot from Sears, so there is a LOT of parking available.  Great Access and parking, so it gets a 5. Facilities, Overall Rating 4 This building is only a few years old and was recently remodeled when the chain did a reimaging.  There is quite a bit of seating, but none outside, so you can't eat outside on a nice day.  Restrooms were adequately sized, clean, and easy to find.  Overall, a 4. Staff and Service, Overall Rating 5 I sat at the bar this trip, so I didn't have much interaction with the hostess, just enough to tell her I was going to the bar.  The bartender recognized me, as she had served me many times before.  As usual she was very friendly and responded quickly to my needs.  The menu has lots of options, including several non-burger entrees.  Even though they had to cook my burger to order, it still didn't take too long.  The service was excellent, a 5. Presentation, Overall Rating 4 The food comes out on a small platter, with the fries placed in a silver-colored cone/cylinder.  Very attractive, but not something that takes your breath away, a 4. Meat, Overall Rating 4 My burger was cooked just as I like it, cooked all the way through with no pink, yet there was still some juiciness to it.  Not dripping down your arms juicy, but not dry either.  It was char-grilled but didn't have an overwhelming charred flavor.  Very good in my opinion, a 4. Bun, Overall Rating 4 The standard bun option for this burger is an onion bun and I didn't change that.  It was a good, firm bun that held up well in the sandwich, but wasn't tough or dry.  It had a good flavor and went well with the burger, a 4. Toppings, Overall Rating 3.5 Bleu cheese:  The cheese had good texture and tasted really good.  Bleu cheese doesn't melt well over the burger, but just softened instead.  Because it was crumbles instead of a slice, the distribution across the burger wasn't even and some bites had a lot of cheese while others had only a little or none.  Pretty average for Bleu cheese, a 3. Steak sauce:  I can't say this did a lot for the burger, but it wasn't bad, a 3. Chipotle aioli:  I didn't really notice this and wouldn't have known it was on the burger, except for the slight heat it gave the sandwich.  But, again, it wasn't bad, a 3. Tomato slices:  This was just very average tomatoes, like you can get in any supermarket out of season, so they didn't add much flavor to the burger.  But since they did add a nice fresh juiciness that the sandwich needed, I'll give them a 4. Shredded lettuce:  I don't think shredded lettuce adds much to a burger, other than a few greens for your diet.  When the lettuce is shredded, you lose the crisp bite of a lettuce leaf.  It didn't detract from the burger, but sure didn't add anything either, a 3. Onion straws:  These were certainly the dominant topping on this burger.  They were crispy and held up well until the end, a 5. Balance/Taste, Overall Rating 3 The burger maintained its integrity all the way to the end, which I think was mainly due to the onion bun.  The standard bun Red Robin uses sometimes doesn't hold together, especially if moister toppings are used.  The onion straws dominated the flavor, although the bleu cheese bite did come out at times.  The bun was just a little too big for the patty.  While there was a little meat in each bite, in a few bites there was very little.  Good flavors, but the balance was a little off, so I'll give it a 3. Sides, Overall Rating 3.5 Steak Fries:  I'm not a big fan of steak fries, as they don't seem to get the crispiness I like.  Except for when they first came out, these fries quickly become soft.  You can have as many refills as you want, but I really only got a refill because I could, so only a 3. Peach iced tea:  This tea had a good peach flavor, and I wasn't overwhelmed with sweetness.  A good flavor and balance, but some might want it a little stronger, 4. Value, Overall Rating 3 Since I got this burger for free, it was a good value this time, but I don't think I would get this particular burger if I had to pay full price.  It costs a little more than most of their burgers and just doesn't warrant the extra cost, in my opinion.  I'll give it a 3.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-frederick?start=60

Great burgers! I love the Tavern Double burgers (they are actually smaller than their normal burgers), and I usually get the Pig Out burger with bacon and bacon aioli. I get the jalapeno version when I'm feeling spicy. The beef is very good, as are the buns. The bottomless fries are delicious, but you can get a salad as a healthy option. I have gotten the ribs that come with mac and cheese and coleslaw--yummy comfort food! I am also a big fan of their cheap happy hour beers and margaritas! My favorite chain restaurant and I love the cheesy diner décor with nostalgic posters and plaques.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-frederick?start=80
Shelly A.,"Leesburg, VA",11,84,107,2.0,12/22/2013,"Way too loud and bad service.  The burgers come with ""endless"" fries... probably a good thing because the burgers were served with about 8 fries.  The food was served by a runner and we didn't see our waitress until our dinner was done and the water glasses were empty.   The food was good but the music was so loud it was ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-frederick?start=80
Justa D.,"Frederick, MD",0,58,,3.0,2/14/2015,"Love the burgers, service consistently bad.  Visited this location a number of times and there will be a line only to find half to 3/4 of the tables in the bar area were empty.  Took my son one time who was 20 and they would not let us sit in the bar area (at a table).  Then told me we could not get the bar happy hour specials outside of the bar area.  Done with this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-frederick?start=80
Billy M.,"Frederick, MD",4,34,21,4.0,6/27/2013,Very kind service. My burger was messed up but the server kindly took it away and ordered a new one. The manager then brought out the new burger (with extra fries) and apologized. The food was very good. And we received the bill to find they had given me the burger for free. The service definitely made up for some mistakes with the food but I will definitely be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-frederick?start=80
J S.,"Frederick, MD",0,7,5,2.0,2/19/2015,"We were immediately ushered into the bar area to be seated at a table with high standing chairs. Problems with my back make it difficult to be seated in this situation, and when I asked to be seated at a booth instead, the response was somewhat frosty and cold from the hostess. Not the helpful and inviting response I expected. We were then left to be served by the bartender who was clearly too busy to provide any decent customer service to anyone. We sat with a view of the kitchen counter where the orders are placed for pick up. It was disappointing that our meals sat for nearly 10 minutes before the bartender could stop making drinks for other patrons and get our food. The food came to us warm not piping hot. During the course of our meal the bartender kept leaning over the bar asking us how our meal was. We felt somewhat disrespected as getting our attention from behind the bar and calling me ""Buddy""  instead of coming  over to our table and providing service should have been. When I asked for the check the bartender told us that he would bring it right away. He obviously forgot. I had to take my credit card over to the bar to pay. While standing there waiting to have the bill processed another waiter asked ""can I help you there Buddy?"" Apparently ""Buddy"" is what they call all their male customers. I left there feeling like I paid for a sub-par meal with horrible customer service. We will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-frederick?start=80
Chris P.,"Williamsport, MD",69,45,7,4.0,6/25/2012,Love the fried zucchini strips! Get a double order and some ranch dressing and you'll be flyin high!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-frederick?start=80
Taylor H.,"Walkersville, MD",1,10,,4.0,7/11/2013,"I went to the Red Robin in Frederick for the first time about a week ago with my boyfriend, and I loved it! The location is great, right across the street from the FSK mall and just off of the highway. The interior was nice and cozy, if not a little cramped, but everything was very modern and clean.  This is one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants, and he convinced me to order the freckled strawberry lemonade...it was AMAZING. There are real strawberries mixed in and the whole drink is just mind-blowing, take my word for it. For $3.99 you get unlimited refills...and I took advantage of that by having 4 (including 1 to go!). Oops!  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger, and he ordered the Bonzai burger (a burger with pineapple). Both were really great, and they didn't fall apart like many burgers do. The beef was cooked perfectly too.  My only complaint was that the fries were kind of cold, and the burgers were a little pricey! Other than that, it is definitely a restaurant I will be back to again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-frederick?start=80
Kseniya P.,"Gaithersburg, MD",0,4,,2.0,5/18/2013,"We've gone to several Red Robins in the DMV, it's one of our favorite places. This location is by far the worst we've dined at. The servers have absolutely no team effort and need to re-learn basic serving priorities. Your table should not still be waiting on a drink when they are more than half way through their appetizers. We were watching our beers sit at the bar. We even reminded the server that dropped off our appetizer and then when our waiter came by reminded him. Instead of taking less than two minutes to bring our drinks that had been waiting, he decided to go to the next table, take their dessert order and then continue to put it in the system. Several staff walked by without delivering let alone glancing over at the numerous drinks waiting to be delivered. I had to walk up to the bar when a manager walked over and asked him if I could deliver my own beers. The manager replied with, ""Let me check that they're yours and I will bring them."" Our server ended up delivering the drinks and of course no courtesy or apology. You would also think the manager would do a table touch to see why a customer tried to come to the bar to pick up their drinks. The waiter also never once even offered waters while we waited. After our meal he asked if we wanted anything and when we said no thank you he replied with, ""Okay, good. I'll bring you your check.""  We will not be back to this Red Robin again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-frederick?start=80
Karina G.,"Frederick, MD",0,4,,4.0,2/21/2012,"I went today. Great prices, great service. The food is usually good. I love their riblets, but today they just felt really dry. Manager came and delivered our food and made sure we were properly attended. Their drinks are not heavy, so you can always have a glass without worrying about getting liquored up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-frederick?start=80

Meredith L.,"Gambrills, MD",0,1,,2.0,3/29/2014,"The food was decent, however the service was lacking. None of our empty plates or glasses were cleared off of the table during our visit. Several tables around us had never been cleared off and cleaned. However, employees were just standing around doing nothing. Not impressed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-frederick?start=80
Francis S.,"Frederick, MD",6,65,13,5.0,5/30/2011,"OMG to the Max ~ I have waited for Frederick to get a RRB forever and folks today this place opens up.  The food is great and the staff (although new) is eager to serve you the best burgers in-town.  This place rocks, but be cautious they just opened today and they are new so they will make mistakes.  But let them get going and this will be Frederick HOT SPOT!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-frederick?start=80
Leah L.,"Frederick, MD",1,11,1,2.0,12/19/2011,"Love the burgers, but I don't like the way the restaurant is set up.  It's so crowded and tight. Most of the restaurant is set up so it's a big long couch seat stretched across the whole middle of the restaurant, with tables down the line that are put so close next to each other, and regular chairs on the other side of the table. There is absolutely no privacy. I was literally one foot between me and the old man next to me. I felt like I was eating with a group of 30 people and not a table of 2. It was so uncomfortable and I'm definitely not eating there unless its the middle of the day when it's not as crowded and I can get a private booth seat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-frederick?start=80
N K.,"Upper Saint Clair, PA",0,21,,5.0,3/30/2014,"We were pleasantly surprised last night!  It had been well over a year since our last visit and what a difference.  Clearly new management as every aspect of the restaurant has changed.  Friendly, attentive staff and the kitchen was on its A game.  Food was delicious, hot and delicious.  Our server Bailey provided great service and kept our glasses full and was personable.  We'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-frederick?start=80
Daniel D.,"Thurmont, MD",1,4,4,2.0,1/26/2014,If your going to be a good burger joint you have to hand patty your burgers it was fast service but highly disappointing when I got a very thin beef patty I got the burning love sandwich witch was tasty the beer is ice cold though,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-frederick?start=80
Rob R.,"Frederick, MD",1,27,2,3.0,12/31/2011,"Picked up four burgers  to go on thursday night. I got the Bonsai Burger and it had pineapple (not enough) and bacon additionally (not enough). It was OK but far from remarkable. Portion of fries was small. Ruby Tuesday or Applebees can provide a better burger at a smaller price. I had previously eaten at this restaurant shortly after they opened with a similar impression - not particularly pleased but not particularly unhappy. For a place that is all about burgers they should be able to do better than this. I give it three stars for the fact that it's great to have a ""burger joint"" in town, but at $10 per burger plate and with Freez King and Beef N Bunz in Paradise in town at equal or better prices and with my Red Robin experience so far being lackluster, it sure isn't five star and four seems too generous. They serve beer, which is always welcome. As a side note, on my first visit to Red Robin there was a completely seran-wrapped car in the parking lot. I took out my cell phone and took a picture. The manager walked up to me and told me to erase the picture off of my phone. Really, he did. I just laughed it off and walked away from him. Not a big deal at all, I was just taken aback about it and how silly it was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-frederick?start=80
Hannah M.,"Frederick, MD",0,65,,3.0,9/10/2013,"Had dinner at Red Robin tonight with my grandaughter. The food was delivered quickly and was very good. The only problem we had was the waitress brought us our check without asking if we wanted dessert. It kind of felt that we were being rushed out. I asked for the dessert menu and ordered. She took the check back and updated it. She seemed a bit surprised that we wanted dessert. I would think it would be to their benefit to ""upsell"" the dessert. Would have been a higher star rating except for that. Don't get me wrong, though. The waitress was nice & polite. I actually think it's a training issue.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-frederick?start=80

Katie S.,"Thurmont, MD",2,7,1,4.0,7/24/2011,"I have been to many other Red Robins, but today we went after church with 10 other people.  The wait was only 25 minutes which I thought that was pretty good considering the day/time/# of ppl.  The food was good, as I expected.  I really want to rave about the waitress.  She did an awesome job!  We have what can be a pretty rowdy group and she kept up with us really well!  We never waited for a refill, she was extremely friendly and incredibly accommodating to our request for multiple checks.  Great job Meghan D!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-frederick?start=80
