Daniel V.,"Pearland, TX",63,138,137,3.0,8/5/2017,The brand new place looks pretty nice but it's smaller than the other locations. The staff is friendly and very helpful recommending a good burger. The salsa and guacamole is not that impressive. It's something 1 person can take down pretty easily. The burgers were pretty good but the bottomless fries took a while to refill. Overall we had a pretty good meal so I would come back and give it another try.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-friendswood-2?start=20
Ryan W.,"Houston, TX",75,1,,5.0,12/2/2017,This is my all time favorite burger restaurant. I have never seen the many ways that you can fix and decorate a burger. My favorite burgers are the Royal Red Robin and the new Smoke and Pepper bacon burger. This place is worth every penny you will spend. The service needs some improvement but I give the place 5 stars because of the food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-friendswood-2?start=20
David A.,"Manvel, TX",2,149,34,1.0,11/11/2017,Mistakes after mistakes. I Just do not understand why they can't give better service.

A M.,"League City, TX",0,21,,2.0,12/23/2017,Took way too long to get our order. Enough to where our waiter apologized that he had to get the Manager on it but we never saw the manager come over. One waiter working on at least 5 tables with other staff members sitting around and just talking.

Herr M.,"Buda, TX",0,61,,2.0,10/23/2017,Service and wait time were fine. Was the burger good? Yes. Was it $15.00 good? No.  Whataburger is better value for the money than they are.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-friendswood-2?start=20

Austin M.,"Seabrook, TX",137,48,11,1.0,11/15/2017,"We tried Red Robin for the first time and was extremely disappointed. When we walked in we were welcomed by three different parties all waiting to be seated. Turns out there was no host, and after waiting several minutes someone's had to go grab someone to be seated. How do you have no one at your front door welcoming people in? When we were seated our booth had a horrible hanging light that gave us both headaches, it took the entire meal to get used to it. A table got seated behind us and they requested to move because it was so awful. This is definitely a place to ask for a table over a booth, so you don't have that light right over you. The burgers were okay, not the best but a good quality burger. The ""bottomless fries"" were small portions (which was definitely okay) but came out lukewarm at best. Our server was great (I wish I had caught her name), but the rest of the staff looked like zombies. Likely will not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-friendswood-2?start=20

Jay G.,"League City, TX",5,7,,4.0,10/15/2017,I love Red Robin. We usually have to drive all the way from League City to the Pearland location if we really get a craving! This one is much closer and just as good. I got the blue ribbon burger with bottomless fries. The blue cheese on the burger was in three fat chunks. Bummer. Would have preferred them to be crumbled evenly for that perfect bite. Our waitress was moderately attentive but the food seemed to take a long time to cook! Very long for what we ordered. The building being so new means that it was extra clean. They were fairly busy there too. Definitely will be going back with the family again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-friendswood-2?start=20
Robert A.,"Houston, TX",1,4,,2.0,10/13/2017,"Walking in to the restaurant the host seams like she didn't want to be there you can tell she had an attitude. Our waitress was awesome, but she didn't get my co worker order right so we had to wait about 10 15 minutes for another burger to come out as we waited my burger was getting cold.

OT S.,"Houston, TX",0,58,13,3.0,8/4/2017,"A-OK ... They were quite busy for a midday Friday.   The walking space between table-seating, bar-seating, etc. could have been slightly more generous. There was a LOT of RR-staff running around ... probably  more  ""in-training management | supervisors "" than would be normal.   The pattern for servers through the store is chaotic and not well thought-through.  Someone always seems to be in another's way. The layout is similar to Chili's, with table seating on each side of the U-bar. For a hamburger joint, the menu is very extensive.; including many options for toppings, condiments, buns, whatnot ...   Their ""Whiskey River BBQ""  burger was pretty good, but the burger-patty does get lost in the fixins.   When I asked to explain the difference between the $15 burgers, $11 burgers and $7 burgers, the server did not really know, so eventually someone from the kitchen showed-up to ask me what I wanted to know .... geeeze.  in a nutshell, cheaper burgers  are made with 80:20 ground beef, middle priced burgers are supposedly 90:10 ground beef, and then there's Angus Beef  (fat content not disclosed). Even accounting for bottomless-fries, I felt their burger prices were at-least 25% too high.   I was not really impressed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-friendswood-2?start=20
Jenn S.,"Cypress, TX",0,57,15,2.0,8/10/2017,The service was really good or I would give it a one star. The patties tastes frozen. Worst burger in a long time. The fries were cold. Dessert was chocolate something with vanilla ice cream that tasted old and horrible. Usually I can eat any dessert but not that one. I left it in eaten Hopefully over time this place gets better,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-friendswood-2?start=20
Christine B.,"Clear Lake, Houston, TX",26,1,,3.0,9/15/2017,"The burgers were just ok. Nothing special that's for sure. Also, any of the fries are extra. Way to expensive for a burger.

P R C.,"League City, TX",0,23,,4.0,11/13/2017,"I have eaten at Red Robins in other cities and come away with so-so experiences. Today at the Bay Brook Mall location, my experience improved.  Service was a bit slow at the beginning, but the managers stepped up to fill the gap. We arrived after lunch hours and before the dinner rush.  So training was occurring at several spots in the dining room, but the managers moved away from the trainees to seat us and then bring our drinks.  Our server, when finally available, suggested a tasty burger for my husband.  He enjoyed it immensely. My burger was a little salty but very tasty as well. We will return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-friendswood-2?start=20

C D.,"League City, TX",0,12,1,2.0,10/1/2017,"Well, I went in with such high hopes. But, waiting 1 hour and 15 minutes for my food is a bit long. I did have the tower of onion rings and they were crispy and delicious, and I ordered my burger , but it got to me really late. I asked for a to go container because I was ready to leave at that point. Perhaps they need more servers on busy weekends...too few employees and too many hungry people.

Derrick R.,"Austin, TX",0,2,,1.0,8/14/2017,"We stopped by the Red Robin Baybrook Mall location in Friendswood, TX for a late lunch. We were seated next to a couple RR staff in uniforms and noticed one waitress showing her bra strap to a fellow seated at another table. On to the food... My friend ordered a BLT with ""bottomless"" fruit (refills were delivered in a pill cup sized container, seriously).  I ordered the prime rib au jus sandwich that sounded delicious but came to the table as thin sliced previously frozen gristley deli cold cuts. It was pre-sliced, packaged grocery store roast beef. It had that iridescent coloring of bad meat and it smelled rotten. Rubbery and microwaved. Imagine expecting PRIME RIB and getting a 7-11 quality sandwich for 15 bucks, much less a serious case of food poisoning. RR should take this off the menu or call it what over processed spoiled product it is.  Manager acted confrontational and rude upon us pointing out the problems with the food and treated us in an unfriendly inhospitable way.

Vincent N.,"Sugar Land, TX",243,4,,4.0,10/14/2017,"I went here for lunch today and had an overall good experience. My two friends and I ordered Fried Pickle Nickels as an appetizer, which came out rather quickly and was quite delicious! Campfire Mayo served as a dipping sauce and was a nice touch to bring out the flavor of the appetizer.  I ordered the Burnin' Love, a burger that was cooked well done and quite spicy due to the jalapeño pepper that accompanied it alongside the fried peppers present in the burger itself. The burger was pretty good and was served alongside bottomless fries. However, the french fries were okay, nothing special in my opinion.  The entrees took awhile to come out though. We had to wait about 20-25 minutes to eat (busy restaurant likely due to lunch hour rush on a Saturday afternoon). Overall, I would recommend trying this place out for a gourmet burger!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-friendswood-2

Jonathan Y.,"Houston, TX",2,9,18,1.0,10/2/2017,"Service was sub-par, wait time was acceptable, atmosphere was family friendly, but oh my god was the food awful. The best part of the meal was the milkshake which was actually pretty well made so hats off the the bartender who made it for me. (and that is not saying much cause i'm a huge sucker for all things ice cream)   Appetizer- Northern Poutine fries, 9$ for gravy, mushrooms, and a couple cheese curds. Taste was edible... Burgers- I've had better burgers at fast food places, and I think would prefer every burger on the McDonald's value menu to this, The worst part of the burger is that the patty was burnt, after my 2nd bite only thing i could taste was burnt beef it was disgusting. I would give it a 0/5 and say it was almost inedible, my brother's burger wasn't as burnt as mine but it still had the gross burnt taste on it.

Maria W.,"Houston, TX",321,849,3943,5.0,8/6/2017,"The manager came to our table to thank us for our service, he mentioned Red Robin's Webster location just opened on Monday, July 31st.  I had no idea, really, I knew the waiters and waitresses were messing up on where plates were supposed to go, but it wasn't anything that wasn't understandable.  For only 2 guests, we were seated quickly on a Saturday night. The restaurant was packed, and we were seated in the bar area. It was nice, but not too noisy. Our waitress was Ivy, a nice quirky lady with a love for makeup and her job. She was the  , so attentive, caring about her customers and her tip. She was on top of it!  Options for a pescatarian? The Salmon burger, Cod burger or just go completely vegetarian and get the Gardenburger or the Boca Veggie burger. A pretty good selection, as most burger places barely any selection for non-meat eaters. Sadly, say you want to Banzai burger, but minus the meat they can't do the no charge like Cheddar's, every substitutions is charged no matter what. No big deal, I ended up getting the salmon burger and a friend got his FREE birthday burger since he is an August baby and apart of the royalty rewards program. After being indecisive, he settled with the bacon cheeseburger with a extra runny egg.  Oh yeah, the bottomless steak fries!!! However, there is an up charge on the garlic parmesan fries and the sweet potato fries.  The garlic parmesan fries were on point delicious. Hot and crispy. The signature steak fries were perfect: hot, crispy, and paired greatly with those different sauces. If you plan on getting any sauces: the campfire, buzz ranch, thai chili, and buzz sauce is so good!! It beats your regular fries with ketchup, or fries with mayo, or even fries with mustard duo.  The salmon was cooked perfect: light pink color, no skin, and tender. I opted out for the blackened seasonings because I'm no fan, but I'm pretty sure it would have tasted good. My friend's egg wasn't runny enough, but our awesome waitress, brought him out another super uncooked yellow part of the egg just for his burger.  I had the best chained restaurant experience here and I hated big chained restaurants. Very well!  Also, I haven't been to Red Robin's in years, last one, I went to was the horrible one in Pearland. It's the worst! I told the manager of this one and he said, ""not to tell them."" Now, that I'm thinking of it, maybe he could be managers for both restaurants? Uh, oh well, at least now he knows I like this location better!!  Kudos to the Webster Red Robin's!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-friendswood-2
Troy K.,"Kemah, TX",335,352,1113,4.0,9/25/2017,"Just gonna say I'm impressed. Yea the patty was a bit thin but it was pink in the middle cooked spot in. I had the royal with bacon and a fried egg on it. I also had the gluten free bun. The bun was legit and not to big. The toppings and the patty were spot on. Service was friendly at the bar.

Ken H.,"Houston, TX",38,231,1177,3.0,9/28/2017,"Several years ago we ate at a Red Robin outside of Humble and since then I've commented to several people on how good the burger was.  When I learned there was a new Red Robin in the mall we went.  Very different.  The one we went to before was in a fast food burgerlike place.  This is an uptown restaurant.   We ordered a bacon cheeseburger and fries extra crisp.   Our server made it obvious she wished she was working somewhere else or maybe just not working.   Our burger was tasty enough (though not as good as I remembered) but smaller that ordinary burgers today and too expensive.  The fries were not crisp, actually they were mushy.

The building sits in the parking lot with Dick's Sporting Goods, Total Wine along with other stores.  The store is teetering 3.5-4 stars. The food was good. The service was fast and friendly. There is a family atmosphere. Being that it is new to the area and there is mall parking, the parking was pretty bad. We were able to burn some calories walking back to the car after our meal. Upon arrival we were seated promptly. Hostess was very hospitable. The waiter arrived promptly and took our drink orders.  We had a party of 4 with two indecisive teens, so it took us a minute to decide on appetizers.  Once ordered, they came to table hot!  The fried zucchini is pretty good. Cut too thick for my liking but flavorful.  The burgers are good as well. Not as juicy and tender as I would've liked but ok. The star of the show was the chicken tortilla soup.  I ordered it on a whim as the kids and my dude wanted bottomless fries of which they did not finish their initial serving.  The soup is superb. Full of chicken, avocado, beans, sour cream...don't sleep on this soup at the burger joint!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-friendswood-2
Lynne W.,"Dallas, TX",47,9,,1.0,1/2/2018,Nothing gourmet about their burgers.  For that matter they do not even know how to cook one to order.  After having to send it back three times it finally came out pink in the middle.  But by that time my appetite had left me.  Garlic Parmesan Fries were soaked in oil and inedible.  Sad to see what was once a favorite go to disappear into the land of forgotten restaurants.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-friendswood-2

During the wait process, my coworker food got cold as he didn't want to eat his food without me having mine.

To set the stage, it's Saturday at noon and the store is very busy. We chose to sit at the bar, which is being taken care of by Alex and Cayla. Both are friendly and personable. Ordered a plain cheeseburger, But when it first came out it didn't have any cheese. They offer bottomless fries, and that's a good thing. Our first order was ordered extra crispy, and it shorter kind of was.... The next order of fries came out we didn't specify extra crispy and they were mushy.

Though with a name that caters to a specific type of food, hence, gourmet burgers, I was still surprised at the variety and options available.

The burgers and sides are mighty tasty as long as you're not counting calories. Bottomless sides are a nice touch, and it's good to see the brand has included other things than just fries to their selection.

Tim K.,"League City, TX",0,21,4,2.0,9/18/2017,"Today, is my birthday and I chose to eat at the new Red Robin in Clearlake. I was so excited and even signed up for my Red Robin Royalty membership.  The waitress promised me a birthday sundae after our meal and asked if I would like them yo sing happy birthday too. Of course I quickly accepted and was even more excited to be there.  We ordered and the food came. My wife complained that her fries were cold and soggy and she ordered an onion roll for her burger (she got a white roll).  My burger was okay but definitely not 'gourmet'. The patty was small and pretty dry.  My wife asked for additional mayonnaise to add some moistness to her burger.  We complained to our waitress about the cold fries and dry burgers. She did bring fresh hot fries but did nothing to rectify our burgers. She blamed the kitchen staff about my wife's burger not having the correct hamburger bun. She only said, ""It's not my fault because I entered onion bread"". She did nothing to rectify and never offered to remake her burger. She reluctantly ate the burger.  When we finished our meal we were waiting for my birthday sundae and birthday song. It never came. My wife asked the waitress about the birthday sundae she promised beforehand. The waitress responded that she will enter the sundae and add it to our check.  Well, this was not a good birthday dining experience. It was stressful and VERY expensive. Two burgers, two fries and two drinks costed me $32.00 without the tip. I'm a kind guy so I left a $5.00 tip .... Wow! $37.00 and I never got my birthday sundae and a birthday song!  In summary, this place is much too overpriced for an average burger. Five Guys and Smash burger are half the price and twice the burger.  My wife promised to take me out to dinner tomorrow for a 're-do-over' so I can have a birthday song and maybe a little birthday dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-friendswood-2
