Andrea S.,"Kemp, TX",133,192,764,1.0,1/13/2018,Pretty sad when you go for your birthday burger and they don't even sing happy birthday to you.   You watch all the other tables get sing but you are left without.   Really bummed out and sad.  Choose this place in lieu of my 50 other free birthday meals and then get treated this way.   Know to skip this place in the future for my birthday or any other celebrations.  Make matters worse; tell manager and they could careless.   That is the real cherry that pisses you off!!!   Drive almost two hours to come here to be rushed and ignored.   Screw this place! Finally got the dumb football off and Will & Grace on only to have it taken away within 10 minutes.  Multiple TVs.  Could have left something decent on instead of the sports crap.  Even news is better.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland
Isela V.,"Garland, TX",171,261,57,3.0,9/28/2017,"Went in for my Bday Rewards burger.  Their service is always consistently friendly and uneventful.  The fact that you can pay for your order at the table and not have to wait for the check or on a waiter reduces your wait time. Can't say I've had their food, other than a variety of burgers.  For the most part, they are cooked to order and their ingredients seem pretty fresh tasting.  You can get a side of fries, sweet potatoes or onion rings.  All of which I recommend.  They serve a variety of local and state beers to pair with your food.  They even have beer flights for your convenience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland
Chris G.,"Richardson, TX",50,21,1,3.0,9/17/2017,"Let me begin by saying our waiter Nathan was awesome!  He in NO WAY caused me to give this visit three stars.  Nathan's performance was a solid five stars.   My issue is with the speed at which we received our food.  There were four of us and we ordered two burgers with fries, the grilled cheese with fries and a salad.  To be honest, I always expect the speed at which we get our food to be a little slow.  It always seems to be that way, but this afternoon was especially slow.  Nathan was even concerned with the speed of the food and he went above and beyond and brought us out an order of fries to munch on while we waited on our main courses.   Once we received our food, the speed of getting our fries refilled was very fast.  Whoever was in charge of making sure the fries were readily available was on the ball.  Those in charge of the burgers and other menu items, not so much. This will not stop us from eating here from time to time, but we may stay away during the busier times to avoid the slow service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland

Iris A.,"Dallas, TX",4,32,52,1.0,9/16/2017,"As this was my first ever visit to RR, I was pretty excited. The place was packed but the atmosphere was pretty good. The sandwich look very generous with size; the sesame seed bun didn't even bother me. It was love upon first bite , soooo much flavor! ...But for the rest of the bites not so much. The breading kind of divorced the meat, then the meat divorced the bread and I'm now I'm stuck with what looks like pieces of a food puzzle that I really don't feel like putting back together. As Red Robin is a well known burger staple, the problem with these burger staples is that since chicken sandwiches are just thrown on the menu to make it universal; chicken sandwiches are always second to beefy patties; the power to carefully craft the perfect chicken sandwich will always go un-honed. Why did the chicken cross the road? The cows took up all the space.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland
Ritz L.,"Plano, TX",97,196,259,3.0,8/25/2017,"While my husband was out visiting his folks in San Diego, CA, his parents took him to Red Robin out there and he swore it was the best food he's ever had burgerwise and it's gotten so much better since the late 90's, so I agreed to try it. When we got there, we got seated right away and the server came to take our drink order. It was very quick and the place was pretty packed. I looked over the menu to find that there were so many items I had a hard time deciding. I don't eat meat, but I eat some fish/shellfish and there were salmon dishes on there. Then, I saw ""VooDoo Fries"" with Bacon, Jalapeño, cheese with Ghost Pepper sauce and Ranch sauce, so I ordered it(Bacon on the side for my husband). I also ordered Peach unsweetened ice tea(it was sweetened, but it's ok)and veggie burger. This place gives out all you can eat fries, but of course I didn't need seconds as that's way too much food. The veggie burger was very delicious with fresh slices of avocado. However, I must say that I was disappointed in ""VooDoo Fries"". It's more like ""BooBoo Fries"", because they forgot to put the jalapeños and the cheese was like velveeta/nachos cheese texture and quality and the ghost pepper was more like Louisiana hot sauce degree of spiciness which is nothing. Over all, it wasn't nothing spectacular, so don't order it. If I'd known that, I wouldn't had ordered it. That's the only concern I had and like I said, my veggie burger was great though I couldn't eat it all. I took the rest of the fries(steak cut fries)and the veggie burger to my doggie children and they ate every crumb of it. I was too full, I had no room for dessert. Maybe, next time for sure. My dining experience was a good one. I will definitely return again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland
Randall R.,"Sachse, TX",217,257,62,4.0,12/4/2016,"It had been about ten years since my last visit, during which I found decent burgers and over-priced beer.  This night, I had no choice, as it was picked for my weekly night out with eight friends The burger is a little better than I remember, hot and dripping, a little heavy on the mayo, which I neglected to request none of - my fault.  Those onion rings that come stacked on something that looks like a dish towel holder are legit, hot like they should be and encased in a batter that clings well enough. One feature I liked was the opportunity to sub a dinner salad for fries/rings - next time. The beers are still a little pricey; this isn't the place to lube up for happy hour, in fact I don't even think they have one. WIGB?  I wouldn't whine if I was forced to.  That's about the nicest thing I can say, except maybe, ""this place is firmly A-OK"".e",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland

Crystal P.,"Coppell, TX",43,77,33,3.0,9/17/2017,"I love going to Red Robin because of the unlimited steak fries but this particular location always seems a bit slow about getting your burger out to you in timely manner. If it weren't for our Waiter, Nathan, I'd probably have given it a 2 Star rating today. Nathan went above and beyond by bringing us steak fries to hold us over until our burgers came out. We're use to this location being slow but never THIS slow. Nathan was on top of it and made sure we were taken care of ...even when they brought only 2 of our 4 orders out he asked where the other 2 were and promptly got them for us. I honestly can't say enough about how pleased I was with our Server. I'm guessing the hold up was whomever was on burgers because when we asked for more fries they were ready really fast. The food is always good as long as you don't mind the long wait after you've ordered. I know that, that's the biggest reason we don't come here as often as we could.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland
Kevin M.,"Dallas, TX",295,112,26,4.0,3/7/2017,"The burgers are really just great. They taste super fresh and have lots of different ingredient combinations. My favorite is the bonsai burger with teriyaki sauce and pineapple, very unique and not too sweet. Fries are thick cut steak fry style, crispy outside and soft inside, even better with the discussion seasoning. The kids menu has 10 or so choices too, it's definitely not just an afterthought. We drove well out if our way to come here because the burgers are that good. The service was mediocre and the waiter was forgetful, or I'd happily give five stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland

My husband got the Burnnin Love Burger and I got the Turkey Burger. Both delicious and bottomless fries!! Yes you heard it,  bottomless fries!! I also want to say that if you are a sauce person like me then try all their delicious sauces. My favorite is the Camp Fire Sauce! For desert we had a cookies n cream milk shake it was so tasty!!

Amanda S.,"Dallas, TX",507,175,133,5.0,5/25/2017,"Holy smokes! This place was packed for a Wednesday night! I'm not sure if it's the area, or because of graduations, but everyone in Garland was here with there moms ;-) including myself and my mom and her mom, haha. Anyways, my family and I decided to meet up here on the fly because my little brother was raving about their fries. There was 8 of us, and we were seated within 30 minutes. They put us at a booth which was odd, and we were a tad crammed but hey what says I love you better than elbowing your neighbor right? Real bonding experience. On the real though, service was ridiculously fast, our server never let our drinks get half full ;-P  and she knew the menu very well. They have a crazy amount of different burgers, I tried the burnin love, a bunch of spiciness on a bun, it was super yummy! Their fries are good too, bottomless, not that anyone could really eat a large amount of them anyways (their burgers themselves are huge) and they have fry seasoning on the table. And they do have veggie options as well (shout out to my mom meat eaters out there). I don't know why I said that.

That was pretty good! Staff was very accommodating. Overall the burgers and beer are overpriced. I'm disappointed the food is not served on a real plate.

Ashley R.,"Dallas, TX",20,124,174,4.0,12/9/2016,I had a good experience tonight. We waited about 10 minutes for a table on a Friday night. Not bad at all. Ordered short stack onion rings for 5$ off the app menu. They were great. Loved the sauce that came with it! We got the poppin purple bottomless lemonade and it was amazing. They filled it 4 times. Our waiter Christopher was so attentive and such a pleasant person to have wait on us. The fries were great and I love love love the seasoning salt. The only issue I ever have at Red robin is that the ketchup is always empty when I'm seated. They should keep those full if they offer bottomless fries,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland

Joselyn G.,"Richardson, TX",47,20,24,4.0,7/9/2017,This review is based on their vegan options. I have been able to get a better vegan meal from Red Robin than I have at vegan restaurants. The veggie burger with a whole wheat bun and veggie toppings is vegan. It is really good and so filling. The fries are vegan as well. The waitress we had was careful to not give us egg or dairy in anything we ordered. A good place to go with non-Vegans.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland?start=20
Dave F.,"McKinney, TX",69,47,23,4.0,1/31/2017,"This is a chain, but I'm including it on my DFW burger joint tour.  There are not many full-service burger restaurants and Red Robin does a nice job overall.  The ambience is bright and cheery.  It's popular with families, but you won't find kids running amok like at Fuddruckers.  There is a large selection of specialty burgers and you'll probably find something that appeals to you.  I had the Burnin' Love, which was juicy albeit not spicy enough for me.  The standard steak fries are ho-hum, but there are many other options to substitute and several have no upcharge.  I opted for steamed broccoli, which was surprisingly good - fresh, dark green, and steamed just right.  Both the steak fries and broccoli were bottomless.  A number of special sauces are listed on the menu.  We had Campfire and Sweet & Spicy Ketchup.  Both were tasty.  It wasn't an inexpensive meal (almost $40 for two), but a good experience nonetheless.

We arrived around 7pm and the place was full. We had to wait a few minutes before we were seated. We were greeted and service was pretty good. I ordered mushroom and swiss and the wife ordered an open burger (no top bun) our food was not hot when arriving. Fries were cold. My burger had a hand full of mushrooms. Now I like mushrooms on my burger but the amount was ridiculous. I scraped off half of them. They had little to no taste at all. My wife loves mushrooms I asked if she wanted some she took one and ate it and said ""no thanks"".

I was impressed with the burgers here and the fries were bottomless which was awesome ! The burgers were big; I could only eat half.  The service was really good. It was an older man, so I was impressed with the service that we received. He was attentive and thoughtful.  When we came it was because my husband had a birthday voucher for a free burger or something like that. You get it when you sign up to be a member.

I didn't want a burger, so I ordered the blackened chicken sandwich with their steak potato fries(which are unlimited by the way).  The chicken was perfectly seasoned, and I enjoyed every bite of it.  The fries were seasoned, and they tasted pretty good.  My friend ordered sweet potato fries for the table, and they were good as well.   If you have room for dessert, they have a variety of shakes and a small section of actual desserts.  I wanted to try the cookie shake, and it was pretty DAMN good.

Gabe B.,"Garland, TX",78,89,77,1.0,6/3/2016,"This rating has nothing to do with the staff, service, or atmosphere. None of that bothered me, and in fact the waitress I last had was actually very nice. This one-star rating is purely about it's food. I'm not quite sure what it is, but the burgers are very sup par. I can't bring myself to come here and choke down one of their terrible burgers. Personally, I think Wendy down the road is miles better. Even Sonic has better burgers than this place. In addition, the fact that they call themselves gourmet and charge what they do turns me away even more. It doesn't matter what kind of gimmick they try to cover it with, the beef itself is so bland it ruins it for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland?start=20

Beckie G.,"Sachse, TX",73,28,1,1.0,3/12/2017,"Okay it is time for me to review this place.  It's a chain so I usually know what to expect.  However, I think everyone should know what is going on at this specific restaurant.  We have dined at this place many times over the last few years.  We like their burgers, the salads, and usually have decent enough food.  But this last time I have had enough.  The management is the worst in the area!  First, the last FIVE times we have been there, the two of us are told there is a 15-20 minute wait.  The waiting area is full.  Yet, YET, there are numerous tables in the restaurant.  So many once I counted and then counted the waiting area....enough to sit every single one of us.  The first time this happened, I said, ""Why?  You have a lot of open tables."".  I was told by the teenager at the front it was because they were short staffed.  Okay, I gave her that one.  I understand that people call in and puts the restaurant in a bind.  Then it happened again a couple weeks later.  Same scenario and scene.  There were even open booths in the Over 21 seating area.  And we were STILL told they were short staffed.  Well yesterday was the  final straw.  We walked in at 1:30 and found standing room only waiting on tables.  Yet, there were more than 10 tables open around the restaurant.  I was told by the young girl, it was because the kitchen was behind and they were short staffed.  I asked to see a manager which she said she would get.  She went back and I watched the manager look my way and but not come over.  Instead, the girl, miraculously found a table for us.  Moving us in front of all those people ahead of us.  I said, no, these people deserve seats before us, but she said they can't sit in the over 21 area and proceeded to take the two of us to a huge corner booth that could easily sit 6 people.  WHAT?  She said the manager apologizes and would be over to talk to us.  I could tell that was not going to happen and quite honestly the whole thing left a horrible taste in my mouth, so we just got up and left.  We opted to take our business elsewhere.   Summary: Expect long waits while staring at empty tables all around you.  We will not be back for any reason whatsoever.  You have had many chances to get your crap together with your staffing issues or kitchen issues or whatever is causing this issue.  But in all honestly, it's a management issue.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland?start=20

I tell them but don't want them correcting it because I don't want them to spit in my food or something because they tell me that's what I order when in fact it's not. My order isn't completely different, it's just another burger on the menu so I'll eat it because I love burgers and I always order burgers there.  The waiters and waitresses aren't the best, they're not very attentive to you, and if you want your order of bottomless fries you gotta ask for it, multiple times before they give it to you. Last time I went there our waiter was EXTREMELY flirtatious, to the point it was very uncomfortable that I couldn't give him eye contact because I was just VERY uncomfortable to look at him. He was attractive and I could tell he'd flirt for bigger tips, but dude, too much. I felt like I was being freaking smothered by you.  Overall it's an OKAY area, they get your order wrong and they should better train their waiters/waitresses and there's usually a long-ish wait for you to be seated, but the food is really good and have fun decor in there.

It's been years since I ate at a Red Robin, and I just wasn't impressed with my burger. Neither was my wife. I can't say that it was bad, it just wasn't great. The fries were good, though. The service was excellent.

Then the flavors of the whiskey BBQ sauce. It was sweet and robust at the same time, make since? Probably not..lol.   They add a heap of onion straws to the bottom of the sandwich along with lettuce, tomatoes and mayo. It got alittle messy but dang it was worth it!

I was with company when I ate here so I didn't complain much, but I knew the second I had my first bite that I would be throwing it up.

The wife approaches the podium and asks how long the wait will be, and surprisingly, the hostess replies with ""10 minutes.""  Not too bad.  I was getting ready to go somewhere else to eat, but we can manage 10 minutes. We get seated quickly and our waiter comes up to us and says, ""Hi guys, welcome to Red Robin, my name is Fabio and I'll be your waiter today.""  I notice his name tag says Rudolph.  Me: ""Um...  Okay, you said your name is Fabio, but your name tag says Rudolph.  What's up with that?"" Fabio: ""Well, I was wearing a red nose and antlers earlier, but without them, people would think I'm weird"" Me: ""Your name could actually be Rudolph..."" Fabio: ""Yes, but who's parents would name their kid Rudolph?"" Yes... yes indeed, Fabio.... Onto the food! I get my go-to burger, the Burnin' Love burger.  I like trying their new burgers, and this was one of them 3 years ago.  Since then, I get this burger about 50% of the time.  It's a regular burger with pepper jack cheese, deep fried jalapeno slices, mild/medium salsa and all the regular stuff.  It's really good if you like burgers with a kick.  It's not that spicy.  Probably a 3 on a scale of 1-10.  As with all their food, if you don't like it, they'll make you a different one free of charge. The wife gets the Petite Bonzai.  A teriyaki burger with cheddar cheese, and a pineapple slice with all the fixins.  She loves it and up until she tried the Mushroom Swiss, she ate this one exclusively.  The petite burger is just a smaller burger that's $1 cheaper. Since there were so many people in the restaurant, the fries were piping hot as they should be.  The Wife's petite Bonzai was delicious she tells me.  I don't like pineapple on anything but dessert foods, so I have never tried it.

Fanta B.,"Wylie, TX",53,90,1,5.0,4/10/2014,"I've been to plenty so-so locations of Red Robins.  Not surprisingly (maybe), is that most of the bad locations are in malls.  I suspect because indoor malls are dying and the clientele isn't great there, and thus, food and service quality suffer. I have found, by in large, this Red Robin to be great.  Hardly ever a wait for a table (unless you show up right after an event just ended at one of the nearby gymnastics places), great service, and great food.  There have been a few times where I had to wait a while to get my extra serving of fries, but that was the exception, not the norm. I think the burgers at Red Robin (here and generally) are pretty good, but really we come for the steak fries.  You could go cheap and get the smaller ""Red's Tavern Double"" and just stuff yourself with fries.  As long as you tip well (and you should, I overtip like crazy compared to most, but I appreciate good service), you only end up paying a few dollars more than some other counter-service burger joints. My wife and I come here A LOT these days (like 1-2 times a week), so we have had many, many servers help us.  Several stand out though for fantastic service, and well, not gonna lie, they are really friendly and really cute too: Aurora, Amelia, Amy, and Heather.  Red Robin is not exactly the place you can request a particular server, but if you get into sections with these servers, you're good to go.

Jooky D.,"Richardson, TX",0,25,1,2.0,1/10/2015,"Short Version: Expensive burgers and horrible service (hostesses are awful), If the parking lot is full keep driving because you won't get seated or get timely service. I'm basing this review on numerous prior experiences since we didn't eat on this visit and the fact that if you charge premium prices you should have premium service. This place used to be good. We used to go there every Wednesday night before going grocery shopping and get seated in our favorite waitresses section. She's long gone and we don't go as often as we used to and now I remember why. We Arrived yesterday (Friday) a little after 8:00pm and to our surprise it was busting out the door with people. We usually sit at the bar when it's busy but this time the bar was also full. The only non-wait table was this little Popsicle-stick looking bar height behind the bar seats so we sat down. There were also 3 clean tables in the bar area that were empty. So we sit, and we wait, and we watch at least 10 wait staff and a manager walk by us without even acknowledging us. The bartenders can see us and they ignore us as well. I guess this table isn't in anyone's section. We ended up waiting for 10 minutes before we walk out and go down to check out the newly remodeled Wendy's. To the Management: Get rid of your current group of hostesses and find someone who knows what they're doing. Or maybe make all seating in the bar first come first served. Re-train your staff to know what section they're serving and acknowledge people even if they're not in that section.

My daughter ordered two appetizers to share, cheese sticks and fried zucchini which were both good, but both breaded. I do OK if I eat just a little gluten, but a whole bun would have cause problems. Who knew this place had such great burgers! Definitely a fan and our waiter, well how can you not like a guy named Fabio! Guess we know what kind of books his Mama was reading when she was pregnant with him.

Daniel S.,"Dallas, TX",22,144,6,3.0,4/13/2012,"Pros: * Burger (Mushroom swiss burger) tasted good & was cooked how I ordered it (medium well) * Bottomless french fries when you buy a burger or sandwich! Cons: * Expensive (cheapest burger or sandwich is $7.99, that's about $12 after tax and tip without a drink, appetizer, or dessert) * While the fries are bottomless, they're nothing special, just average steak fries. Also, I don't know if this is a ""rule"" but when I went with a friend and we both ordered burgers they would only bring out a small individual portion for both of us to share, it seemed to take 5, 10, or more minutes to get a refill of fries. * The bottom bun of my burger was soggy 2-3 minutes after I got it, I'm not sure if it was because of the mushrooms or the burger itself. * While the price says this is a sit-down nicer restaurant (like Chili's), the atmosphere doesn't seem that way.

I don't get to come here very often because of the distance, but if I want a good burger and fries and I have the time to trek out here, it is my go-to preference.

And even though I only come in 3-4 times a year, those RR servers remember me!  RR has pretty good burgers for the prices, and since I now have a teen with a hollow leg to fill, the bottomless fries make it a particularly good deal. They have always been accomodating to wishes for a different cheese, add or subtract toppings, etc. I prefer ranch to ketchup, and unlike Chilis, RR does not charge extra for this sauce.  Sodas are a little expensive, but I somehow raised a kid who prefers lemonade to sodas and water to lemonade!

Sebastian P.,"New York, NY",34,72,,4.0,4/21/2009,"I'm fan of this because I still haven't tried all the burgers. Decent prices for gourmet burgers. I love the blue cheese and anything with pineapple or avocado in it. I wouldn't recommend their fruity smoothies or drinks. They're too sweet for my taste. I would stick to the water or tea. Great service and family friendly place. Also, this is a gourmet burger place and I wouldn't recommend anything else that wasn't a burger on this menu. I went there with my family and my dad ordered something that wasn't a burger and wasn't too pleased. The burgers cater to all tastes. I'd definitely recommend giving it a go. Especially, since it's one of the few gourmet burger places around town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland?start=120
Lori S.,"Garland, TX",10,85,28,3.0,3/22/2010,"Red Robin calls its burgers ""gourmet"".  They do have a lot of choices in burgers with many toppings.  The beef, to me, however, does not have the backyard grill flavor that I love so much.  No charring here.  But the meat is juicy and big.   My husband's bacon burger was too much for him to finish, but he liked the flavors.  You get to choose your cheese from Swiss, Cheddar, American, Pepper Jack, Provolone and Blue Cheese. I had a Garden Burger with Pepper Jack and Avocado on a whole wheat bun.  It was really good, and I substituted slices of cantaloupe for the endless fries.   The prices are upwards of $8.00 and more, but you are thoroughly full when you leave.  I enjoyed my sweet tea, and my husband loved his strawberry shake, topped with cream & served with a refill 'tin' on the side.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland?start=120
Rick G.,"Austin, TX",1,22,1,4.0,2/3/2009,"I have heard of these but I didn't know there were any in the Dallas area! Originally intended on another eatery but it was closed and a friend suggested Red Robin.  Why not, eh? The greeter was friendly, we were seated promptly and our server was quick.   I had the Jerk Chicken Burger - wow, excellent sandwich.  Everything seemed so fresh.  I enjoyed the Caribbean flavors, spices with a hint of sweet pineapple.  The bun was perfect, not dry, nice texture.  The chicken was very tender and moist.  It came with fries, and it's hard make bad fries so nothing exceptional here but for the fact that they are bottomless or endless - so when my fry to sandwich ratio got a little out of whack I just asked for some more fires; that's a nice ""feature"". I will have to give 4 stars based on my initial experience.   Cheers",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland?start=120
Jennifer G.,"Dallas, TX",344,608,123,2.0,9/23/2008,"I had heard many good things about Red Robin over the years and when we happened to pass by this one on Saturday I was excited to finally try it. The menu looked promising. I got a Hawaiian heart throb smoothie and my fiance got the raspberry limeade. They were both really delicious. We started with an onion ring tower. I ordered the mushroom burger and my fiance got clucks and fries. The onion rings were good for the first 6 or so and then I was over it. The sauces that come with it are good - its a yummy ranch and a creamy BBQ of some sort.  The real food took longer than I'd expect and when it finally arrived I was seriously underwhelmed. My mushroom burger was really dry and had approximately 2 trillion mushrooms on it (that's about a trillion and a half too many). My fries were unmemorable - and not very delicious (I didn't even eat them). I tried the clucks and fries plate and it wasn't any better than my own. Sad.  I'm not sure if this is Red Robin's fault or not.. but I felt like I had eaten a deep fryer when I left there - to the point that I didn't even finish my meal because I couldn't taste any more grease. I want to say its my own fault for eating such crap but I'm sad to admit I eat plenty of greasy crappy food and I never feel this disgusting about it so it has to be partially RR's fault, right?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland?start=120
Tom F.,"Allen, TX",4,5,1,4.0,5/5/2009,"A great place to get drinks, burgers, & sandwiches.  Very courteous staff, fast service, and good eats. Had the Jamaican Jerk chicken sandwich this last time - good stuff!  Had enough spice that you could taste it, but not too much to blow out the other flavors on the sandwich.  Usually get the Teriyaki chicken sandwich which is always good.  They have a great selection of drinks (both leaded and unleaded) and the drink prices are pretty good compared to other chain restaurants.   The burgers are really good, and here's a tip if you get cheese on the burger - if you like the cheese pretty melted, you need to tell the server, otherwise it will be only slightly melted and completely intact.  The bottomless steak fries are a nice touch, and are good. It can get a bit loud since they usually have a fair amount of kiddies in there, but it's not as bad as some other places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland?start=120
Susan B.,"Waco, TX",29,17,28,4.0,3/16/2009,"My son had visited a Red Robin in Oklahoma City and had been after me to take him there for a meal. We went yesterday, Sunday, at around 2pm.  The greeters took a little time to greet us when we walked in the door, and the hostess tried to seat us at a table that was dirty. She actually put the menus down on the food crumbs on the table. We were quickly seated somewhere else. That said, the food was hot and good. Our server was polite, and checked back after the food was served. We had the Onion Ring Tower, Bacon Cheeseburgers, and Chocolate Shakes. I highly recommend this restaurant as one of the best burger joints I have eaten at. Your kids will love it!

TJ H.,"Richardson, TX",0,17,,4.0,11/7/2011,"I've been to this location several times.  The service is hit or miss.  Sometimes I get an excellent, attentive server (say hello 25% tip), and sometimes I get a server who just seems to have better things to do (10% if you're lucky).  I think the management at Red Robin should let the servers know they actually have to earn their tips.    The food is really good.  They make a thick patty burger, and this is one of the few restaurants  that consistently hits meat temperatures.  The burger is always cooked properly, juicy, well seasoned, and delicious.  I've read another reviewer recommend the fish and chips.  Every time I go to Red Robin, I see the fish  and chips on the menu.  I almost order them, but then a cheese burger calls to me instead.  Maybe one day I'll give them a try. I love the steak fries, but I prefer soft fires to crispy fries.  Red Robin also gives you unlimited steak fries, so you don't have to worry about not having enough.  I very rarely ask for more, but they're available if you want them. I have not tried dessert, but nothing on the dessert menu jumps out at me.  That is the one part of their menu that really needs improvement.   The price is a bit high for a burger, fries, and a soda.  With tax and tip you can easily spend $15.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland?start=120
Mary S.,"Garland, TX",109,223,8,2.0,3/18/2011,"I have been here several times, surprised I haven't reviewed it yet.  I'm not sure why I went here, I live smack between here and Twisted Root in Richardson.  Atmosphere is dated and cliched, though there is a slight diner element.  They serve pretty drinks, in pretty glasses to help dull the pain of their overpriced mediocre burgers.  $10 for a bacon cheeseburger, which upon arrival didn't actually have bacon on it.  I begrudgingly ate it without sending it back as I was pressed for time.  Really nothing spectacular, not a lot of flavor.  Also for whatever reason there were no onions on my burger, I don't know if that is standard, but no onions FML.  Save your money and skip this one, McDonalds Angus burgers are better than Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland?start=120

john b.,"Round Rock, TX",74,16,1,4.0,11/24/2010,"I didn't know about this Burger chain until giving it a chance one day and experiencing ""endless fries"". I ordered a burger with jalapenos and sauteed mushrooms and onions and it was OFFICIAL! I mean this burger was fu*kin' great-flavorful, juicy, and just great! I loved how my fat ass could keep ordering fries without having to worry about the final bill. It is officially one of my default burger joints thanks to a sista that knows her food spots!

Lisa P.,"Dallas, TX",78,51,,3.0,5/19/2008,"Q:  What do Howard Jones, Richard Marx and Robbie Nevil have in common? A:  They all sang for me while I ate my lunch today.  (P.S.  Robbie who?  I have three words for you, baby - ""C'est La Vie"". ) I'm hip, right?  I know my way around town.  I've even been called ""snobby"" a time or two, and yes, I took it as a compliment.  So, what was I doing at Red Robin today?  Well, I'm a North Garland girl through-and-through.  Not born, but certainly bred.  I was back in my hometown for lunch with my brother and his wife, my Dad and the neice and nephew (2 and 4 respectively).  We chose Red Robin for its family friendly vibe and were happy with the result.   We were seated right away at 12:30 on a weekday, so I presume the rush here is at dinner.  Our server was prompt and friendly, though a little annoying at times in an over-specific-question sort of way (""Would you like a to-go container?  How about a plastic bag to carry it in, too?""). Our food pleased all around the table.  Both grown men had the prime rib dip and it looked and smelled awesome.  I gathered from their grunts and slurps that the sandwiches lived up to their looks.  My sis-in-law had a wrap and tortilla soup which quickly disappeared and the young 'uns had quesadillas and pizza from the kid's menu.  By the way, that kid's menu had a lot of choices, and each meal came with a side - choices included actual whole foods, even, and not just more fryer-fodder. It was the Ensenada Chicken for yours truly (and it's all about me, right?) and it was nice.  Two breasts - the skinny kind - coated in a colorful but not too spicy rub accompanied by a generous side salad.  It was perfect penance for the double scooper with hot fudge I ate last night after dinner. For the record, I actually love Howard Jones.  I kinda grooved on the 80's flashback soundrack at this place.  At least for the first 45 minutes.  I also love Ms. Pac Man, and I kinda sorta taught my nephew how to play on Red Robin's machine after lunch.  I left feeling all warm and fuzzy, wondering what it would be like to head back in time to my days of poufy bangs and Bonne Bell lip gloss.   Back before I was so cosmopolitan :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland?start=120
Kenyatta A.,"Garland, TX",2,3,,5.0,8/22/2011,Maybe you people should read the menu! it's a great burger joint. yes the burg is a 10 bucks but you  spend 7 bucks at mcdonalds and burger king. they have lots more choices and all you can eat french fries. they have great salads as well. remember is a hamburger joint take it for what it is,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland?start=140
Tara D.,"Plano, TX",0,13,,5.0,1/1/2011,"This place is great!  We go there a lot, and the best thing about them is how consistent they are.  Every time we order something, it tastes the same, which is great!  They have very good burgers and a great selection of different kinds of burgers.  The chicken is good, too.  Usually, the food arrives very quickly, and it always arrives piping hot.  Highly recommended!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland?start=140
