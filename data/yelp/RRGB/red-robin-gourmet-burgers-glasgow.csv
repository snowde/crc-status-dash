Kara G.,"Newark, DE",2,8,9,4.0,12/20/2017,"I am majority vegetarian, so this is not an establishment I would frequent. However, the veggie burger is quality and I am grateful for this option. James was our server and he was FANTASTIC!!! One of the best servers I have ever had, in any establishment.  Thank you James!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glasgow
Janille D.,"Glen Mills, PA",28,61,284,2.0,8/28/2017,"I came here with coworkers for lunch and decided to take advantage of the beautiful weather by being seated outside. After being seated, a server came by with menus and drinks.  We each put in our orders--two salads and a wrap. We assumed it wouldn't take very long to prepare, but we were waiting for at least 30-35 minutes before our food came out. When my salad finally came out it looked less than appetizing. The description for the southwest sombreo salad reads:  ""A Southwest classic with a twist-Ancho-grilled chicken breast, black beans, avocado, fried jalapeño coins, red bell peppers, onions, roasted corn, cilantro and lime on a bed of mixed greens. Topped with a crunchy tostada sombrero with Cheddar cheese and jalapeño spread. Served with salsa-ranch dressing"" Not only did my salad take forever, but it was missing avocado, and probably had 1/2 tsp of every other topping. I basically was given a giant bowl of iceberg lettuce with fried jalapeño and overly seasoned chicken. Also, corn was not roasted, but instead reminded me of sweet canned corn. The sombrero looked like what you would get if you sprinkled cheese on a tortilla and put it in a microwave to melt. Don't get me wrong, I love melted cheese and I love tortillas, but this did not impress.  The server took a pretty long time to come back and check on us, so we decided to just get up and ask to be rung up.  I've heard decent things about this place, and I was luckily in good company, but my first visit wasn't a great one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glasgow
Bernie C.,"Newark, DE",0,18,25,4.0,7/15/2017,"There are vegetarian options.   I had the Mac and cheese, with a side of bottomless broccoli, and bottomless fries.   Mac and cheese was creamy.  Would get it again. Fizzy Moscato was tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glasgow
Michael M.,"Indianapolis, IN",24,67,203,4.0,3/24/2017,"It's been years since I visited a Red Robin...But I'm glad I gave them another shot. They have made changes for the better if you are not in the mood for a high calorie burger(which are always great).  I'm giving this a 4 for 5 reasons, the healthier options now, the alcohol selection, endless sides and the kids menu. The healthier​ option is called a Wedgie (not how I remembered them). This wedgie is not painful at all. It's dropping the bun on your burger and using two wedges of lettuce instead. It also comes with tomato, onion, pickles, bacon and Guacamole. You can actually drop the bun on any burger. I had a wedgie chicken sandwich. It was really good. The bar is a full bar and you can get just about anything. The Kids menu is like 10 options. It is a good selection. Also the sides on the kids menu is endless. So they can eat endless fries or endless fruit. Adult sides are all endless. Which it is great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glasgow

The waitress assigned to our table wasn't very attentive.   We were not satisfied with our food, I don't know what happened because in the past our food at Red Robin's was usually good.

But then my daughter found a hair fried onto a french fry (which was no surprise since the cook had a heavy beard and wasn't wearing any netting over it). She quickly lost her appetite. The burgers tasted like they were frozen and recently thawed. Once we were served, the server never came back over to check on us until it was time to get our check. She never asked us if we wanted refills on our drinks, even though our glasses were sitting there empty.

Robin W.,"Bear, DE",0,4,,2.0,3/11/2017,"They use to be really good, now they try but fail. They cut the zucchini into strips that are way too big and you stand a 75% chance of most of them being raw. The last visit the server told use the apps were 50% off, what she forgot to mention was that it is only the apps on the small menu at the table. The soup comes with this  burnt piece of bread , so hard not worth breaking teeth on. We have a royalty card but go so infrequently now that the food and service has deteriorated.

David R.,"Elkton, MD",3,26,2,3.0,6/6/2017,"As usual, I don't write reviews unless it's really great service and food or something went wrong. Well, this is the latter of the two. I stop by for lunch and order my Burning Love burger. Server asks how I would like it cooked. I told him ""Well done, burgers (ground beef) should always be well done"". Well, that's what went wrong! My burger comes out and I bite into it, totally pink inside. Of course they redid my burger. In the meantime, the server and mgr come out several times to apologize. I appreciate the apologies, but I'd rather have my food done right the first time. Plus I was pressed for time and had no wY to take it home as I was on my bike, so I had to gulp it down. Then I get my check and was surprised to find that there was nothing deducted for the mess up. Had there been, that would have eased the pain of the situation. I still tipped the server as usual because it wasn't his fault. But I might have tipped more had they discounted the check a little. I still have them 3 stars because the food was great once it was cooked thoroughly. Sorry Red Robin, but I'm looking for a better burger joint to replace you.

Catherine A.,"Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD",175,10,8,5.0,6/5/2016,"This was my second experience at a Red Robin, this one being a different location from the first.  But it was still a great experience.  I came with a couple of girlfriends for dinner before our movie.  We ordered the towering onion rings to start and they were fresh, hot and delicious.  One girlfriend ordered her usual chicken tenders and fries, and had no complaints.  I ordered a french onion soup which was hot and flavorful.  Then my other girlfriend and I split the Red Robin Bleu Ribbon burger without lettuce and it was delicious!  We ordered the Absolutely Absolut Freckled Lemonade and the Tropical Mai Tai and both drinks were well made with a good amount of alcohol and flavor.  Our server was very attentive and always came around to check on us and our waters were always filled.  Good food for great prices and even better service! Edit:  At this particular location, because there is a Regal Cinemas next to them.  If you dine in, Red Robin sells discounted tickets to the movies.  The tickets are $8.50 per ticket and you can exchange them for any movie at Regal provided they are not sold out.  The only thing you would have to pay additional is if the movie you want to see is in 3D.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glasgow

I ordered one of signature burgers and it was delicious. A little over cooked, but not too much to make a fuss over. Because I ordered a medium it was on the low side of well done. The Bacon on the burger was so thin it was somewhat comical. Still not a big deal. It was tasty though. I would just say hen someone is paying almost $15 for a burger the presentation should be better. I also tasted the kids burger my daughter got and it was horrible.

Jennifer D.,"Bristow, VA",0,16,1,2.0,1/2/2015,"This was one of the worst dining experiences we have had in a long time. We were a party of 6, and were given a 20-25 minute wait. We went to the bar for drinks and appetizers. Sean came to our table pretty quickly and took our drink order. They only had enough iced tea for one of our orders, but were told they were freshly brewing more. 20 minutes later still no drink. Our appetizer came pretty quickly, but when we asked Sean for more chips and refills on our drinks, he disappeared for 10 minutes. My husband ordered a margarita and they either didn't use the right mix, or the mix was bad. After waiting 45 minutes our table still wasn't ready. Sean brought refills, no chips and didn't clear any of the dirty dishes.  After an hour and a talk to the manager we were finally seated. We ordered dinner and it came out quickly. The chips that we ordered 30 minutes earlier showed up when we were half way through or meal. Despite being attentive, our second waiter never pre-bussed our table and we sat with dirty plates for quite some time before he cleared them.

But for burgers they are really good have never been dissapointed with their burgers Steak fries are really good as well.

Emily F.,"Rising Sun, MD",1,31,6,1.0,12/6/2015,"We hadn't eaten here for a little while and now I remember why.  It doesn't seem to matter how you order your burger cooked, because it is coming out charred.  Period.  It will be well-done and probably charred.  It just seems to be how these kids cook here.   We got seated quickly as a party of 3 on a Sunday night at 5pm.  We ordered 2 apps and 3 burgers.  Apps were great, came out fast.  Once we put in burger order waitress disappeared so we couldn't tell her our daughter actually wanted to add mac n cheese to her order so when the kitchen gal brought our meals out, we told her and she passed the word to our waitress.  15 mins later waitress finally appears to ask if we need anything and says she is about go to check on the mac n cheese, and tells my husband she will get him a drink.  Another 10 mins later she finally appears with mac n cheese and drink and husband asks for fries since its supposed to be bottomless fries, right? I've realized that is how they get you on the bottomless fries deal, they just never come back around where you can ask for more fries, so you are finished with the rest of your meal before you could possibly get anymore.  So a good 10 mins after that she finally brings a plate of fries out and we just tell her to take them back away because why on earth would he want them now, we are ready to leave and wanting our check.   We get the check and walk to the front rather than wait for her to find the time to come back to our table (she was NOT busy was just missing in action, hiding in the back somewhere or something, she only had one other table that we could see besides us).  I handed our check and credit card to the host at the front and asked if he could take care of this for me because we were not waiting on her to come back, and instead of asking if anything was wrong or if he could do anything for us, he just takes the check to her with our cc and they run the card and he brings me the receipt and has me sign and tells us to have a good night.  Didn't have one ounce of concern that we were upset and felt no responsibility to inquire or offer to get someone to talk to us.   Will NEVER return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glasgow?start=20

Cooked perfectly with the right amount of juice, a nice bum and seasoned to perfection. The fries were crisp and not over oiled.

You better plan to only get one beer though because you won't hear back from the bartender until you are ready to leave. You might be thinking the place was busy... If one other patron accounts for a packed house then I better get into the bar business!  On top of getting the beer he left off part of my order and the beer itself was stale.
