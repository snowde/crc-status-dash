Deb E.,"Mechanicsville, VA",4,28,55,1.0,4/15/2015,We arrived at 4:30 on a Wednesday for dinner three of us. We were seated by the bartender at a dirty sticky table. I looked around to ask someone to wipe it. The manager was chatting with a server eating. Another server was seated texting on her cell phone. I asked the bartender who has a couple of patrons. Jeremy our server came and wiped it off. The food was ok. Burgers were very well done! Jeremy was the only working server. For the whole hour we were there the manager (black man) sat on his iPad while other servers talked to each other or texted. Like the food but the service and management is horrible,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen?start=40
Russ C.,"Mechanicsville, VA",63,8,43,3.0,1/2/2015,"Service was great... Appetizers were over cooked, Nachos and boneless wings.  Lunch was ok, average... I didn't expect my socks to be blown off by the food at Red Robin, but I've been here several times and it was prepared better in the past. Quality depends on what high school kid is cooking today I suppose.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen?start=40
Kathy C.,"Ashland, VA",0,56,1,1.0,12/28/2014,"Maybe it was just tonight and it being after Christmas.  We headed over to Red Robin after seeing a movie at Virginia Center Commons. the time was approx 6:30 p.m.  Lots of people waiting to be seated.  We decided to sit at the bar.  Waited over 10 minutes for a menu and not even a nod acknowledging us being there.  I think they're short staffed tonight or something but definitely not a good experience. We headed to Plaza Azteca instead--great, fast service and good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen?start=40
Michelle A.,"Frederick, MD",168,795,205,1.0,12/6/2010,"We were here on Halloween night after we ran out of candy at 8pm, and our server was AWFUL.  Her name was Melisa, and she spent most of her time chatting with fellow staff members, or sitting at the table next to us chatting with another set of customers.  Meanwhile, our cups were empty.  Or our food was waiting to be run to our table.  We heard her say that Red Robin was stupid for being open that evening, that they probably lost money by being open.  I think she was just pissed that she had to work on Halloween.  But whatever, she at least could have pretended like she cared. It's a shame because the food here is decent, and we were really in the mood for burgers, so we were looking forward to a relaxing meal.

Robert M.,"Ravenna, OH",100,748,784,3.0,11/6/2012,"This is a tough one.  I went with the family for dinner so I will give you all of the feedback. First, the server, 'Addo' was his name.  He is a huge bright star for this place.  5 stars for hiring him.  Very friendly, provided suggestions, was engaging with the family to include the 5 year old.  He was really fantastic. Onion Rings, fantastic. Guac burger was really good according to my daughter.  Will repeat. Whisky/Burbon Burger - Wife has had before at other locations and was a little disappointed, but in general it is still quality burger. Bacon Cheese Burger - This was mine.  According to the menu, they feel this is the best in the burger universe.  I must say if what I got was their best, they need to get out more often, even to BK.  This was sad, sad, sad.  First, I ordered no tomato, with slaw.  What I got was with tomato and no slaw.  Then, I opened the bun and there was one slice of bacon in total, that had been cut in half and layed side by side, in the edge of the burger.  Let me tell you that the bacon is paper thin and even laying side by side only occupied 1/4 of the burger space.  Addo recovered with an additional 2 full slices of bacon.  I believe it supposed to have 3 total slices.  So, either the kitchen was instructed to cut corners by completely screwing the burger up, or the staff does not know how to read.  Or something in between, but none of the options look too flattering. So I would return, I would not order their Bacon Cheese Burger and I would make sure you check.  Addo is the man, so I hope you get his service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen?start=40

Anthony C.,"Glen Allen, VA",31,51,58,3.0,4/1/2012,"Neat burgers pretty good onion rings rock... got salad avoid cobb The RR has great specialty burgers.  Always good portion, but you do pay for it.  Think they might be a little overpriced, but normally you a great burger.  I love there onion ring tower.  Thick onion rings piled up on to form a tower and a few dipping sauces to plunk them down in.  I can put it in words, they might not be your normal onion rings, I have had better, but none like these,  They do taste good, just a different kind then what you get at most places.  I normally always get the tower.  Tonight I got the Avo-Cobb Salad.  Was pretty tasty.  Again good portion.  Most of us all enjoyed our food. Biggest complaint that I have with RR is the wait staff.  I have been there and have great service, but more than not,  we don't get good service.  Usually young kids waiting on you.  Don't know if they can handle the amount of tables they get or just ""disappear"", but we got horrible service tonight.  Slow to refill drinks or get our food out.  Asked if our kids food could come out first, since they were starving and it came out with the rest after a long wait.  She did, bring us some french fries early to nibble on, but don't like feeding my 9 month old french fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen?start=40

Melissa M.,"Columbia, MD",1,3,,1.0,10/6/2013,"I've never been to Red Robbin before -  I've wanted to go, but just don't have one near me - plus we were staying at the hotel right next door so we decided to stop in for dinner. Took the server 15 minutes to greet us - then made excuses saying ""the other girl was cut and no one told me that I had you"", took another 10 for drinks - 15 for my brothers shake - then his burger came out wrong (all he said was no tomato, lettuce, onion so it was nothing complicated). My brother needed a refill on his water and she took another 10 minutes getting that - then when I guess she realized she had forgotten it she said to him ""Oh, are you ready for that water now?"" ..like what? What I found interesting was that the manager actually dropped off our appetizer - I was hoping that he would apologize, or say he was going to take something off the bill or something but none of that happened - he came over and sneered at us. I can only assume the waitress went in the back and said we were a problem table.  Never checked back on us - took too long to get the check, then she finally dropped it off and I got my card out right away but I watched her walk over and start a conversation with a coworker - I was going to give her the benefit of the doubt but after 5 minutes and her moving to another terminal to continue the conversation I had to get up and give her my card.  It was our waitress' birthday that day - we watched everyone sing to her. It's the only reason she got a tip from us - otherwise she would have gotten a big fat 0.  Her name was Ashlee.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen?start=40

Stephen B.,"Glen Allen, VA",0,2,1,1.0,6/28/2010,"So...today's service at red robin was an abomination. The server, Patrick, seemed to be in a daze. He couldn't get any of our order correct.  Although the food (mainly the fries) were great and came out piping hot, that was NOT enough to make up for the subpar service.

Hannah G.,"Henrico, VA",12,204,3,5.0,12/16/2016,"My family started coming here on Sundays and since our party is all over 21, we always are seated in the bar area. I do not say this lightly: Ardecia is the best waitress any of us have ever encountered. If Red Robin is smart, it is only a matter of time before corporate snatches her up and sends her around the country to train employees in customer service.  Half this rating is based on Ardecia alone. Without her, it would sit at a solid 2.5-3 stars. Ardecia is what keeps me and my family returning so consistently. She is fast, friendly, and everything is accurate. Definitely not one of those waiters/waitresses who gets annoyed when you ask for sweetener in your tea, if you know what I mean.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen
Deborah B.,"Mechanicsville, VA",75,147,194,2.0,1/2/2018,"We visited on a Tuesday night and the place was almost empty. We were promptly greeted and seated. We we're shocked at the $13-14 burger prices. We ordered  the tavern burgers for $7ish. Our server was friendly enough, but service was super slow and awkward. When the food finally came, they brought out a single side first. Several minutes later they brought the matching entree and one other entree . A few minutes after that, the third person received their entree. Sadly, the wait did not lead to hot, fresh food...it was all barely warm. The glasses were pretty dirty.  The chalkboards for kids didn't really work. The kids menu was a black and white photo copy that read ""flip for more fun"", but the other side was blank. The restrooms were disgusting, the door lock was non-existent, and the towel dispenser fell open and nearly smacked my son on the head.   When it was time to pay the check, we were told to use the tabletop machine. It wouldn't accept my number for rewards, yet when I tried to sign up for rewards, it told me my number was already in use. So, the server attempted something for 10 mins, but still didn't get it working. Finally, we paid the bill, and in true Ziosk fashion, the machine was out of printer paper.  IMHO, this place is probably not far from closing down. I'd rather hit Five Guys for fast burgers or Burger Bach for gourmet burgers. We will steer clear of this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen

S M.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,30,12,1.0,11/11/2017,"We have been to several Red Robins and have never had a problem. This place is terrible. We came at night and there were only a few people there, yet it was so dirty. Employees were just hanging around so I don't know why they wouldn't just start cleaning. The silverware looked so smudged and cloudy like it had been washed in dirty water. Every drink I tried was watered down. I told the waitress it seemed that the machine was messed up and she looked at me like I was crazy. I always get a freckled lemonade which tends to come in the wavy cup and it's usually fairly red. Mine came in a large glass and it looked like sprite and tasted like water. I then tried the orange crush and same thing...water. I gave up and ordered a coke which came out looking like tea and tasted terrible. Worst of all I was charged for it. The fried egg on my burger was burnt and that's the easiest part to cook. That was after waiting 40 minutes for 2 meals when no one was there. You would think after 1 or 2 problems with the drinks they would be apologetic and take it off the bill but they don't seem to care..all the employees were talking about was not wanting to be there and wanting to go get drunk. It pained us to even tip at all",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen
Gismo B.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,5,,1.0,10/24/2017,Seems like a lack of management at this location as there were several employees roaming around aimlessly while it took me at least 10 minutes just to order a drink.  When I realized that it was going to take another 10 minutes (possibly longer) to order food I asked to move somewhere else. After moving still noone bothered to take my order.  I would understand if this place was busy but i think there were actually more employees than customers.  I will not be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen

Tony A.,"Midlothian, VA",145,213,636,4.0,7/17/2014,Red Robin has become a birthday tradition in my family. For some reason we always seem to go here for a birthday lunch. The burgers are always pleasant and the milkshakes are to die for. I've been on the Whiskey River BBQ burger lately. There is something about that flavor profile that I can't get enough of. The staff has been pretty consistent over the years. They usually go the extra mile if you want to split a burger. I've never had an order wrong and that's probably why I keep going. This place can get jumping but I've never had to wait more than 5-10 minutes. The fish and chips might also be a hidden gem if you want something instead of a burger. Over all I have nothing negative to say about this location.  A+,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen
Cattleya A.,"Glen Allen, VA",9,6,,3.0,4/23/2017,"My experience was mostly good but a couple of things disappointed me. We were promptly seated and didn't wait long for the waiter. I had the raspberry tea which was sweet and wonderful. For appetizers we ordered clam chowder and bacon cheese fries. I was a little skeptical about the clam chowder but it was really nice. Now, the disappointing part. You would think that no one could mess up cheese fries, but Red Robin found a way. First this dish cost $7 dollars yet there weren't that many fries in the basket. Secondly, the cheese was melted kraft single squares. They melted sliced cheese squares! And they only gave us two squares. I don't know if all locations do this but this was not worth $7. I could go home and make better cheese fries with melted shredded cheese or a homemade cheese sauce, but never just cheese squares. Well after that our burgers came and they were good. I had the big buzz mac-n-cheese burger. I notice that they don't give you a lot of fries with your meal or the refill. They only give out kid portions which is annoying. We got our refill of fries when we were basically done with our meal also. The waitress did give us drinks to go however. In conclusion the cheese squares just really disappointed me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen
Keegan Z.,"Richmond, VA",88,225,672,4.0,7/31/2014,"I love Red Robin, and this particular location definitely lived up to what I have to come to expect of them. Great food, great service, good atmosphere. Came here to use my birthday burger reward with a friend. It's nice that some places still give you more than just a buy one get one coupon, and Red Robin is one of these places. The service was stellar and the food came out just how we ordered it. While this place doesn't necessarily offer anything that unique, it's still nice to be able to have consistently good experiences here. Whenever I see a Red Robin on my search for restaurants in the area, I know I have at least one solid option for dinner. Overall: 4.0 stars ----------- Pros: - Consistently great food. - Stellar service. - Prices are mostly reasonable, especially when one considers the unlimited fries included with the sandwiches. Cons: - Nothing really unique about their offerings relative to other similar establishments. - Don't ever try their claw machines, it's like every location goes out of its way to make their particular machines impossible to win on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen
Lauri W.,"Richmond, VA",1508,536,966,2.0,1/19/2016,"Let me tell ya'll about last night.  I don't usually write bad reviews, but I gotta keep it 100% honest and my experience at this Red Robin was horrendous last night. I just have to leave a little bit of feedback.  Whenever we go to Red Robin it's never my idea; it's the fiancé's. I admit, they do make a good burger, but when I am craving a burger (which is rare) I prefer to go to Burger Bach. Keepin' it local: It's what I do! Anyway, back to Red Robin. So, we walked in and were promptly greeted by the sweetest hostess, bless her heart. We waited for about 15 minutes until a table was ready for us, so they said.  The table was ready, but the waitress was not. I couldn't even tell you who our waitress was because we never saw her. Another poor guy halfway waited on us the entire time we were there because he was nice enough to cover for the overworked waitress. He saved the day, though. He had one of the best attitudes I have ever come across from someone working in the food industry. He admitted that things were a hot mess but never lost his cool; he was always very polite and did the best he could.  So what made it so bad besides not having a waitress? Well, we never got water refills. It took them forever to come back with anything we asked for. Extra ranch? Sure, but it'll take 20 minutes. First they forgot my fiancée's fries, then when they brought them up there were like 7 fries in the basket. Come on, Red Robin. Really? My chicken tender salad was cold and the tenders were not meaty at all. I was not pleased. If it weren't for our johnny-on-the-spot waiter, I probably would have walked out. This is coming from someone who is far from a service snob!

Fries were great. At the end we were again instructed to pay with the machine. I guess customer service is not their thing. Just a tip, ditch the machines and train you servers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen?start=20
Harold T.,"Martinsburg, WV",0,48,,3.0,3/6/2016,"To start off a group with the same number came in after us and got seated before us.  Secondly, the table we were at was terrible.  The varnish on it was peeling off and felt tachy.  Felt like it was not cleaned.  Service was ok and friendly.  The burger was very good and seasoned well and juicy.  The price was more than what is was worth though.  The endless fries is a sham.  Your first portion is small and they'll bring you one more then give you the ticket.  Same goes for the drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen?start=20
Andrew M.,"Mechanicsville, VA",0,25,2,4.0,8/11/2015,"After my initial review, the owner of that location got in touch with me and apologized for falling short. I was given a gift card for the mishaps that occurred that day. I also did not write a negative review in the hopes of receiving anything in return.  So let me cut to the chase. My wife is pregnant and it was her birthday tonight so I had ZERO say in where to eat. I agreed we could go back to Red Robin and give it another shot. It was seriously amazing! The waitress was terrific, she was also the bartender and covered our section. We were offered a loyalty card, we were given the happy hour offers, we were asked if we had been before. These are all things that were never mentioned last time.  We ordered an appetizer of fried zucchini and jalapeños which were really good. The entrees came out and you could tell someone cared about the appearance. The food was presented identical to the pictures on the menu. This time around my fries came in the decorative metal container.  I will absolutely go back to this location. We are both full and happy and I'm glad we have it another shot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen?start=20
Don J.,"New Kent, VA",0,15,,1.0,1/10/2016,Went there today. One of the dirtiest restaurants I have ever been to. There was about 3 inches of food between cushions in booth with mold growing on it. Table was sticky and service was terrible. If it is that dirty in the front just imagine how bad it is in the back. Don't waste your money here. FIRST time here and the LAST!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen?start=20
Hugh H.,"Fort Myers, FL",1,30,6,5.0,7/10/2016,"Good burger, I ordered the basic burger or the original I believe it's called. It came out without the lettuce tomato onion I ordered. The bartender took it back and it came back with what it should have. Eric the manager came out and apologized and was more than generous adjusting my bill. The service is good,it was quick and prompt. Other than the snafu with the condiments on the burger,the only other thing I would say is leave off the red relish that they put underneath the original  burger it's funky. Some may like it . But I would say put it on the side and apply it on at your own choosing",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen?start=20
Kristen W.,"Harker Heights, TX",3,23,,1.0,7/14/2015,"Horrible!  The worst Red Robin I have ever been to!  We expected a normal lunch, it turned out to be a TWO Hour Lunch due to poor service, and the place was empty.   Our server was training someone, which is generally ok because you essentially have two people working a table.  We watched our food sitting in the window for more than 15 min, you would think with TWO potential servers someone would notice this food...nope.   Finally our food came, and one person was missing their food.  The server came back to see if everything was ok, we pointed out that someone was missing their food and they returned with the plate, the toast was cold and rock hard from sitting.   Summary--terrible service, good luck to the trainee because your trainer is failing you! Red Robin has bottomless fries, only if you ask for them, they were never offered.  When we requested them we were still eating, by the time the refill came we were waiting to pack up to get our checks. They only came to even check on us within a minute of getting our food, then they only came back for money.  Summary---request your refill as the first plate comes.  The service was very ""going through the motions"" without ZERO thought to the process of what they were actually doing. Mothers with a baby, good luck.  Their changing table is in the small stall and comes down over the toilet, so you stand at one end of the table and hope nothing drops over the edge, if it did drop off it would land in the toilet.  Maybe they could put the table in a larger stall or even just on a wall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen?start=20

Tiffany Y.,"Fairfax, VA",29,74,10,2.0,3/31/2014,"Everytime I go to a red robin it never seems up to par. We walked in, four of us around 3.  Hostess asked us if we were all above 21. That's an odd question. No, as my niece was with us, so it took about 4 minutes for them to seat us in the back of the restaurant where everyone else was scrunched in. Whatever. Well then it took forever for our bottomless fries to come out and when they did literally seven fries came out for the four of us. For a place with bottomless fries they sure didn't keep up on making them.  Needless to say, never impressed when I go here. I need to remind myself why not to go back. I recommend going elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen?start=20
Crystal R.,"Henrico, VA",36,5,3,1.0,8/31/2015,"Never in my life have I had such bad service in a chain restaurant.    Every single point of service was bad.    We sat for over 10 minutes waiting for a server to greet our table before I finally asked a hostess if someone was ever coming.    We ordered chips when we ordered our drinks and it took 17 minutes for them to bring chips to our table.    Chips!     Our food took about 40 minutes to come out although we were a large party so this was expected.     What was not expected is that half of the orders were wrong or undercooked.   The food was not even as described on the menu as far as ingredients.   Even after multiple complaints to the manager he did nothing but look at us with a slack-jawed face and say ""OK"" and is there anything else.     No offer was made of even so much as a free drink.     Our waiter continually did not check on our table at all and over 80% of the time Our party had empty drinks.   I'm not sure what the point of the ""service buddy"" was as I clicked the ""request server"" button, started a timer on my phone and eventually gave up AFTER NINE MINUTES and asked the bartender for the napkins I wanted.  Do not ever ever ever go to this Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen?start=20
Geoff J.,"Mechanicsville, Richmond, VA",19,9,2,2.0,8/30/2015,"We had to ask for a manager before we got seated, and then we noticed that the table was covered in a greasy film. He reseated us in an adjacent table, which had the same greasy film. Then I noticed that all the tables in the vicinity were in the same condition. So we stayed there. But then we received the wrong drinks and had a long wait for the server to come back to our table so we exchange them. There were so many issues with the service and the food that the manager comped the entire meal and then gave us two gift cards. The gift cards are a genuine attempt to make the experience something less than a complete failure, but we are more likely to give them to someone else than to ever eat at this location again. Yet they did add one star to this review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen?start=20
Julia M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",25,27,37,3.0,6/20/2015,"Probably one of the worst Red Robins we've been to when it comes to gluten free and service. Usually managers or even chief comes to the table to assure gluten free but this restaurant did nothing to make sure our son's food was good to go. At other RR gluten free usually brought to us separately by Chief or Manager. We were also abandoned from the start by our waitress, she had large group to take care off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen?start=20

Austin M.,"Richmond, VA",35,132,11,2.0,1/3/2014,"Place seems to be slipping.  Hardly got refills, my food sat in the window under lamps for seven minutes.

Riley F.,"Richmond, VA",128,33,1,1.0,11/19/2014,I will not say much in this review... my turkey burger was raw and tasted like blood.

Bill S.,"College Park, GA",0,4,,1.0,8/18/2015,Awful service.  We waited to get seated and there was seats open.  The couple before me walked out.  It took forever to get our food and we had no silverware.  When I asked a manager who was just talikng to someone for silverware she didnt get it but blew me off .  Awful service go elsewhere,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glen-allen?start=20
