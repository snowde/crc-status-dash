Now I can remember why it's been 4 years I haven't been here, this place seems like high school kids are running it and no one knows what they are doing. It took almost a hour to get our food and this place is only 50% filled. This place needs to re-train or get a new manager that knows what they are doing. I know I won't come back here!!

Nancy A.,"Glendale, CA",562,421,1370,2.0,12/17/2015,"It's been a while since I've been to any Red Robin.  I got the pig out tavern burger with their famous unlimited garlic fries. Wow, things have changed. The pig out burger was so small. I don't remember the burgers being that small. It tasted okay, just not as delicious as before. I think I could have gotten a better burger at Carl's Jr. The 6 dollar burger at Carl's Jr is much better and bigger than the overpriced Red Robin burger. Also, I was so disappointed in the fries. I used to love their garlic fries. It was made with real garlic and the fries used to be so flavorful. Now, the garlic fries have no real garlic and they just sprinkle it with garlic powder.  Such wasted calories for a less than mediocre meal. I definitely will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=20

Deborah N.,"Glendale, CA",14,16,5,4.0,3/5/2017,"I live close to Red Robin but had never gone to the restaurant. The restaurant was not crowded at all but the waiters seemed to be running around like it was, a bit odd. What was strange that in addition to our waiter, two other waiters brought our food in stages which was ok because at times, we could not even flag him down for refills of the drinks, etc. The food was excellent and on point. The sweet potato French fries are the way to go. The onion rings were good as well.  The Teriyaki burger was the best and grilled pineapple made this burger awesome. I would go there again.

Paige P.,"Los Angeles, CA",244,9,2,1.0,11/23/2016,"TMI, but imma just come out and say it: after eating here, i got the worst stomach-ache and diarrhea i've ever had in my life. immediately after eating, i felt sick to my stomach.  Now normally, i'm really good with food and i LOVE spice, but i've never felt so sick like this before. i felt sick the entire night afterwards and now it's 2 and i've spent the last little while just in agonizing pain. ): EDIT: its 3:30 now and i'm miserable and nauseous still.. it wasn't too busy and service was alright, even tho our server did come to the table a little late to ask for drinks. (he was easy to flag down to ask for more condiments, etc, and was there to help with the little pay/game machine at the end).  the food was alright while we were eating. I was starving so i dug in right away.  i ordered the A1 peppercorn burger and my mom ordered the fish & chips. the fried onion in the burger was really wilted and slightly greasy but i love fried onions and it wasn't too bad. the presentation was a bit lacking, especially compared to the images in the menu (and i know, of course there would be a difference) but i did think to myself it was a little depressing how different they were  can't comment on the fish & chips since it's not my favorite dish anyways, but my mom liked it.  but i will definitely never be coming here again ): this was my first time trying red robbins and i'm not ending my night a happy camper.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=20
Mish S.,"Long Beach, CA",386,504,682,5.0,1/27/2017,"I don't know where all these bad reviews are coming from... I came in on a super busy Saturday night and was attended to right away, this is by far one of the BEST burger spot I have been to in the whole of LA and I am a burger fanatic (this ranks next to Umami Burger)  The service was fast, the food was prepared very well (and in under 20 mins) - the meat was perfectly tender but properly cooked (I am very picky about my meat being properly well done). The servers were sweet and friendly, and never gave us any attitude for continously asking for condiments and they were always attentive.  I love their concept of bottomless steak fries (i love potato) and that their burgers are so gourmet but also comfort-food styled. They have really unique blends and combinations, from avocado to caramelised onion blends to teriyaki pineapple.  I loved my southern burger, I highly recommend the sweet bbq and caramelised onion combination on their nice bun that wasn't ever soggy! The meat portion was just right too, any thicker and I would have felt nauseas from being overfed.  The oreo cookie lover milkshake was JUST right too, I loved how it wasn't too thick or sugary, it made it easier to enjoy the whole milkshake without feeling sugar high.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=20

Katrina M.,"Burbank, CA",98,2,,3.0,4/30/2017,"*WORST RED ROBIN EXPERIENCE EVER* I am an avid fan of Red Robin, and I really enjoy the food and service of most Red Robin's I visit. I am giving a 3 star rating cause this only happened once out of the many times I have come here after the incident occurred. Which they have been absolutely terrific, and amazing since, plus, I have not seen this server since the incident so I am hoping he was fired or something. This is what happened:  Now every server I get at this location is great and very friendly, except for one. We were seated in a booth closer to the bar, and at first had a pretty decent server. He took our drink orders and when he came back to take our food orders, he was EXTREMELY rude to only me but not to my father or boyfriend(Sexist?).  Here is how it went down: He looked at my father first and said ""Hey man what can I get you, Sir?"" of course being very friendly, then my boyfriend saying ""alright boss, your turn. What can I get you?""  Then it was my turn.  He will barely even looked me in the eye and said ""what do you want?""  I turned and said ""I would like the crispy chicken sal-"" he cuts me off and said ""what dressing?"" I turn and say ""may I please have 2 cups of Italian Dressing, oh and please no bacon on the sal-"" he cuts me off, says ""K"" turns to my father and boyfriend and says ""your food will be here shortly guys"" ignores me and leaves. Now, I have religious beliefs that prevent me from eating bacon and the salad I was ordering had bacon on it, so I was hopeful that he understood that I didn't want it on the salad.  About 10 minutes later the food is here. However I had a HUGE scoop of bacon right on top of the salad. I tell him I asked for no bacon, again he made no eye contact and he just grabbed my plate and walked away. I get my salad back, with no bacon. Finally. I ate my salad. All was fine. Until I needed a drink refill. I said I would like Diet Coke. He leaves and then he brings Sprite. I said Diet Coke. He leaves and brings Dr. Pepper. I said Diet Coke. He leaves and after 10min I realize he isn't bringing me a Diet Coke. I go to the hostess who was glad to get me my actual order.  After all of this. We were set to leave. When my father requests to speak with the manager and reported his horrible behavior. He was rude, mean and a just a mega jerk!!!  Luckily I haven't seen him since.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=20
Olivia O.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,9,3,2.0,3/16/2017,"We were at Red Robin this past Saturday..Looked forward for the Burgers they are sponsoring on TV ($6.99 Tavern) which also shows on there site..When arriving they said the price went up to $7.99.. Every additional toppings will be extra about $1.00 (sorry, can't clearly remember). I was afraid almost to ask our waiter for things needed around our table, about the menu.. etc..because he seems he was getting bothered..I had to explain to him this is our first time coming.

Alyse T.,"Torrance, CA",207,158,859,3.0,11/30/2015,"Decent burgers, fries, and milkshakes. I came here at about 9PM, an hour before closing. The restaurant was quite empty so the service was very quick. I came with my sister and we split a burger and milkshake. We ordered: Whiskey River BBQ Burger with bottomless fries:  The burger was tasty but was cooked a little too well (we ordered medium, it came out well done). My sister and I have lighter appetites, so this was the perfect size to share. Nana-Nana Moo-Moo Classic Milkshake:  This is a banana and chocolate milkshake. They use artificial banana flavoring which is a bit too sweet for my taste. While the restaurant looks a bit run down, it was generally clean, including the bathrooms. If you're looking for a quick bite after the mall closes, this is a good spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=20

Kat T.,"Las Vegas, NV",1446,1037,12313,2.0,6/9/2015,Is it me or did the burgers get smaller? Did the fries get well smaller in portion! I have to ask for more often than I usually do. Two would be cool but lately it's three request! Quick sitting and no wait even though it looks busy. I can't believe grilled onions you have to pay extra! It's part of the veggie section why do you have to pay? Kids spaghetti seems pretty dry this time around. Greedy smurf on the marinara sauce.  Bathroom seems to be messy now and not well stocked.

Marie K.,"Agoura Hills, CA",10,40,2,2.0,12/19/2016,"Our waitress was lovely and we were seated quickly, but the food was dreadful!  I'm a vegetarian and Red Robin doesn't offer much in terms of meat-free choices (even the salads have meat). I decided to get the grilled cheese, but it was the worst grilled cheese I have ever had. It seemed like they left the sandwich sitting on the grill for too long on one side, it was thick with burned, greasy cheese. This made it really crunchy and hard to eat. My sister got the clucks and fries and said the chicken nuggets she makes at home are much better, and she makes those in the microwave.

Kîm S.,"Burbank, CA",10,13,21,3.0,3/27/2016,An update to my review below. I had a talk with the manager his name is SHERWIN. he is super nice and understandable. He apologized for the inconvenience that had happened and he offered us either a 25$ gift card or our money back in which we decided to get a refund. He also put the reward that BIANCA had used back on my account so now i had a chance to get my 10th burger for free. He also explained to us how the rewards program works. He was very nice and i had to give only the managers work and the way he handled this situation was 5 starts . He also said he will have a talk with BIANCA. But its kind of unfortunate that we had to have a talk with tha manager instead of just the waitress doing her job This place used to be good. First i wanted a 2 for 15$ deal that they have and then i asked for a birthday burger since it was my birthday. The waitress her name is BIANCA FI and she was very rude. First she didnt even understand what I wanted then she was like you cant get a 2 for 15$ deal with a b day burger. Then she told us it will be cheaper if we just get a burger and appetizer. We said ok just to later discover she had put our 10th burger instead of our b day burger for free. How funny that our total came out literally equal to the 15$ deal like 1$ cheaper. Over all she didnt give us the b day burger and didnt even check to tell us we didnt have the burger for free. She was over all very rude didnt know how to do her job and although we tipped her she didnt know how to do her job. DEFINITELY NOT GOING,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=40
Jacqueline Teresa M.,"Los Angeles, CA",139,146,111,3.0,1/15/2017,I love Red Robin. This location is probably the closest to me. Therefore I tend to come when I'm craving a juicy burger. Today was a different occasion though. We came in to satisfy mom's craving and celebrate my mom's birthday. We were seated in less than 10 minutes. Our server seemed really nice but quite stressed. While eating I noticed his manager or superior getting mad at him and talking to him without taking him to the back. It was very obvious and we felt really bad. Half way through dinner I mentioned to my server that it was moms birthday if they could sing to her. He agreed in a nicely matter. He took quite a bit to come by but it didn't bother us. He then came to us and brought my mother her little complimentary dessert and apologized because his coworkers didn't want to sing along with him. I felt really bad for him. I think it all had to do with his manager and that incident. This was very disappointing because incidents behind the dining area shouldn't affect customers. I don't blame our server. I blame his manager for not handling the situation in a proper matter. Will I visit this location again? I don't know. Maybe not.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=40

I unfortunately didn't read the reviews cause we were starving and we had the kids with us, so we needed a place where they have high chairs, kids menu...

That threw a huge wrench in their system lol.  We got our order our food and got it pretty quick.  The food was really good!  The server was really nice but I think they were so busy that they didn't pay too much attention to us.  That didn't bother me too much though.  Their payment tablet thing is pretty awesome!  It allows you to do everything right t your table.  It saves a huge hassle of dealing with the waiter/waitress and going back and forth, waiting to get your change/card back, Etc.   I am not sure why ppl give this place bad reviews, but for the most part we enjoyed our lunch, even though there was a million ppl inside, it somehow was still enjoyable.  I would recommend trying it out.  Hopefully your experience will be as good as mine!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=40

When we got our appetizer  (pretzel bites are dry and the cheese is gross) the plate I got was unclean. The all American patty melt was nothing special (or even okay).

Even better because the bartender was good at making drinks, personable and friendly.  Bottomless fries? They were great, but I have no will power so had way more than I ever would have had. The burger was good, very filling.  The Mai Tais were tasty, not too strong but not weak either. I didn't get the bartender's name, but he's fairly new to LA from Wisconsin.

Then we sat down ad realized they're basically short staffed. I'll give them a chance, no need to judge right? Well this was not the case when I got my food. I tried to be fair but my food was over cooked and dry. Burgers are the specialty right? They should know how to cook burgers! And the fries were overly done. Hard and dry! Even the extra order!

Rola T.,"Burbank, CA",193,179,116,3.0,2/21/2017,"I'm giving 3 stars for this place. My reasoning being: 1) the hostess (Suzanna) is really unwelcoming. 2) food is oily  We arrived at the restaurant and Suzanna was talking away with another co worker. we waited about 10 minutes and we were not helped. Finally we decided to just sit at an open booth. we didnt know if we were to seat ourselves, or wait for this chick to finish her long conversation, but we got tired of standing around. so we sit at a booth, we are a table of 2. she sees us, walks over, and rudely remarks ""what are you doing, you need to wait to be seated"". we politely explain, we thought we seat ourselves because---and she immediately cut us off and didnt let us finish the reasoning why we sat ourselves. anyways she proceeds to find us a table, it takes about 3-4 minutes. she was just really rude and unwelcoming. Red Robin- you are lucky I was starving or I would have taken my business elsewhere. The wait time for the food wasn't bad, and the server we had was actually quite nice and helpful. I wish I could remember her name, unfortunately I can't. The food was good. The wings were pretty tasty, and the burgers were great, just a tad on the oily side. I thought that the garlic fries would be good, but they weren't. They're drenched in this oil that tastes like garlic, but the oil is too much and its just overwhelming. the whiskey BBQ burger is really tasty though. also, the smoke and pepper burger was wonderful. we also had an order of the spinach and artichoke dip. its pretty basic, same as everywhere else that you go and order that appetizer.

We were seated right away in a booth and after getting seated and presented with menus, we waited for about 10-15 mins before we were approached for help? She said she was filling in while our waiter was on break. Still, the service could've been faster. We ordered our water and food at the same time since we waited a while. Finally got our food. I had ordered their Billionaire Burger which came with a potato in the burger and supposedly melted cheese, tomatoes, lettuce. I asked for a medium well. Burger came out and nothing like the picture. Cheese was barely melted and the meat was more rare than anything. It was hard looking for our waiter since I was never asked for a water refill. I just went ahead and ate it. I like the bottomless fries but the fries though they were steak fries were really dry. I love burgers but the service and food needs to be better.

The food gets a HUGE smile everytime! the sauces and bottom less fries do as well! only down side is sometimes you walk in and no one is there to greet you and you are just standing there staring at the empty host spot like hellooo?

Rita W.,"Rockville, MD",527,337,1553,4.0,4/12/2014,"Steak fries lovers, come here! You get them with your burgers, and they're BOTTOMLESS! Well, the container they put them in doesn't have a bottom, but the important part is that you can eat as many of these beautiful steak fries as you want.  I started coming here often after my daughter fell in love with her kids meal: corn dog, mandarin oranges, and chocolate milk. Whenever we're at the Glendale Galleria, she would request to eat here, and each time we do, we've never had a horrible experience. My biggest complaint is that there is no reception here (I'm on Verizon).  Their burgers are good. I've had their: Regular Red Robin Burger/Keep it Simple - simple. Not really special, as it's your typical burger that you can get at most burger joints.  Red's Double Tavern Burger - close to their regular, but with 2 patties/cheese. Their tavern sauce is similar to thousand island.  They also have a burger with 2 patties that's a dollar cheaper than their regular burger, but the double patties burger is smaller than their regular.  Royal Red Robin - the burger with the egg on top. If you like runny yolk, then yum! Burning Love - their burger with jalapenos, on jalapeno roll and such. I wish it was more spicy, but it's a good choice. Bonzai - yum yum. I love teriyaki and pineapple. This is one of my faves.  Guacamole bacon - typical California burger. It's great with chicken.  They have a variety of sauces you can get, and some of them are at no additional cost. I love dipping my fries in their Thai chili sauce, and the financee/bf loves dipping them in the tavern sauce. Free sauce! Better than McDonalds charging for extra charges, ha.  Feel free to customize your orders. You can opt out of fries and get something healthier, such as broccoli or fruit, but not all sides are bottomless/unlimited as the fries are.  The people that work here are very nice. We were able to get seated promptly each time, and none of our food came out wrong. They did forget my daughter's chocolate milk a couple times, but no biggie.

Cristina Z.,"Glendale, CA",0,11,6,1.0,5/14/2017,"My family and I visited Red Robin on 3-12-17, and we had the worst possible experience. We visit this location pretty often, but after this visit I do not think we will return. I usually do not like to name individuals, but unfortunately it was the people that made it horrible for us. Our waitress Giselle seemed to lack the skills needed to waiter, she wouldn't pay attention nor would she write down the order to be able to deliver it correctly. We asked for two cocktails, we received a margarita over ice when we initially asked for a blended one, then when she took that back they just blended it not considering the ratio between the alcohol strawberry and ice(water). This left the drink absolutely diluted in water. Same with the second drink, the coke was so much it couldn't be considered a cocktail.  After we ordered, it took around 40 minutes for the food to be served, one of the entrees was a burger which was requested to have the bun ""double/triple toasted""(exact words used) for it to be crispy, it was delivered with a bun not toasted at all. A salad we requested to have iceberg lettuce not romaine lettuce was delivered with romaine, even though our waitress assured us she would allow the cooks to know. [Understand the requests we made are due to health reasons, even though that should not matter] We made our concerns and complaints known to the individuals helping us. This led to the manager taking over, she too was unprofessional and rude. She basically explained that the salads are not fresh and are tossed out of a bag into a plate that they could not replace the lettuce, instead she gave us the opportunity to choose another salad, which we did... during this time to wait another random waiter.. came to take the burger with the non toasted bun away to replace it with the salad we just ordered. This was even worse because it goes to show the team lacks communication. The salad was replacing a salad, not the burger!!!!! We asked for the manager's name but we were never answered.

I used to go to the Fresno Red Robin all the time as a ""fancy sit down"" meal option in high school. The service is always an average to skimming below average at the Fresno/Clovis Red Robins. Food quality wise, I always order the pineapple teriyaki burger and the last few times I went, the bun was drenched in teriyaki that it was impossible to hold together. This was the same story at the Galleria Red Robin too, maybe there's a flaw in the recipe or the mere stacking of the burger itself. But I digress, I went here a couple days before Christmas because I had relatives from out of town in LA that wanted to eat close-by in Glendale for my mother's birthday. Considering it was the holidays, my family wasn't prepared for the 2 hour waits in restaurants around the area near the Americana. The only option was a seemingly smaller wait time at the Galleria Red Robin but I was sorely, sorely mistaken. I'm not sure where to begin about my experience here.  First, in summary, the hostess was incredibly rude. An odd vibe lingered around her similar to an air of ill-precieved self-appointed superiority from the hostess to over all the various families with their different party numbers, waiting to be seated in a hunger induced dazed after possibly skipping lunch. These families were ultimately at the mercy of the hostess and she abused that power by attempting to seat different families ahead of families that came before those seated. It was not only annoying to see those before my own family who were waiting a lot longer get passed up with a family of similar party size needing to be seated.   Second, after standing for the first 30 minutes and watching the families be seated first. I began to notice the way that certain parties were seated. You know that game Diner Dash and how the 2 party characters will typically be seated in a 2 party booth to get bonus points or something like that? If so or if not, the point is that there were just 2 people taking up a booth capable of holding a party of 8. The lack of... I guess what could it be referred to? Table seating strategy? Whatever it is, it was the same story. Big booths holding just 2 people where there were little tables throughout the restaurant that could have easily accommodated the much smaller 2 people party sizes.  I stayed optimistic. Maybe my impression of the Galleria Red Robin had gotten off to an bad start. Then another 30 minutes passed and another... about an 1 and a half into my wait time, I began to observe a little more about the function of this Red Robin. The tables that sat the parties of 2 began to clear and I anticipated having the my family's party of 7-8 people to be sat. Another 30 minutes pass and we've hit the 2 hour wait time. The tables weren't cleared off and the dirty dishes sat there as another 20-30 minutes were tacked on until a table cleaner? Busboy? I'm not sure what to call the staff member that clears off tables. He finally cleared off the tables in a very agitated, purposely slow manner, throwing a few annoyed huffs there and side glances here to the families waiting outside the area. Third, the manager had to intervene. In hopes that the management intervening would fast-track our wait time, once again... we were mistaken. Another 15 minutes tacked onto our wait time. My mother had to take a more assertive tone in requesting a table. We get sat down. The server has noticed the ""trouble"" we've caused the management and hostess. Proceed to eat in an awkward vibe that comes with also having your waiter throw really off-putting attitude towards everyone by having her take a really abrasive tone when answering questions and placing orders. We get our meals after 40 mins. Get the check done in another 20 and by the time we were out, it was really late at night. Somewhere after 9. It was one of the most single-handedly weird and awful dining experiences I've ever had in my life. But please, for those who've made it this far in my review. I don't want you to think that my family are those people that purposely cause disruptions in restaurants and will seek out to make any restaurant staff member's life, while serving us, a living hell. It's never been like that. They're actually incredibly patient and thoroughly enjoy leaving huge holiday tips because they all understand what it's like to have to deal with customers. However, keep in mind the potential quality of service you might receive here at this particular Red Robins in the Glendale Galleria.  Use this information wisely.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=60

Paige R.,"Glendale, CA",144,68,139,2.0,7/14/2015,"Since I live walking distance to the mall I find myself here when in need of a good burger and fries fix.  It's not necessarily known for being fancy or gourmet but usually hits the spot just fine. Yesterday 7/13 was just a big miss.  The onion bun I always get was unsually hard. It was strange and off putting. It felt like maybe it was stale, someone zapped it in the microwave for a few seconds and then maybe forgot about it. By the time it reached me it was rock solid. Like I jabbed it with a fork and the fork got stuck. It had the consistency of a thick cracker.  I also always ask for my fries extra crispy and usually they come out perfect as requested. Yesterday I found a nearly raw fry in my order, very limp and undercooked and the opposite of what I asked for.  Usually I'd get an extra helping but was so put off by the meal I didn't bother.  Our server was fine if a bit over worked. I almost complained but did not want to bother him.   We initially came in that night because of a free dessert with purchase special.  Then our dessert (a lemon cake) came out frozen. Kind of a fail. We used to come here pretty often but I'm just not so sure I'll be back after this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=100

Anastasia B.,"Los Angeles, CA",139,23,5,1.0,3/23/2015,"Taken aback by the lack of customer service at this location. Our visit started out okay; we didn't wait long to be seated and our server, ERIKA, was prompt to ask for our drink/food order. It all started going downhill once we got our food. I ordered the bruschetta chicken burger and it was inedible. The chicken inside my sandwich was chewy and rubbery. I've never had anything like it. So gross! I took it upon myself to let the server know (because she never asked) that the chicken had a rubbery texture and asked if she could sub it out for a beef patty instead. She sort of just took my plate back without really addressing the situation, which is fine because it really wasn't her fault. What struck me as odd, though, was that she never once took it upon herself to check in with our table while we waited for her to replace my rubber chicken burger. My boyfriend and I just split his burger and fries while we waited, but we eventually ran out of fries and just sat there for a few minutes with an empty plate. Our server never came by to ask if we needed more fries, nor did she stop by to ask if we needed a refill on our drinks. She actually walked right past our table a couple of times without ever acknowledging us. Eventually, my boyfriend flagged her down so that we could order more fries. By the time she came back with the fries, she had my burger with her. She sort of just dropped everything off without saying anything. The chewy chicken was never addressed and we were never, throughout our entire visit, asked if our food was okay. Not. Even. Once. I've worked at restaurants before and I know that you're supposed to check in with your tables frequently to ask how everything is tasting and to offer refills. This never happened for us. Everything was on us. We were never asked if we needed a drink refill. We were never asked if we needed more fries (they're bottomless). We were never asked how our food was tasting. We had to ask. Erika seemed completely indifferent, bored even. Pretty sure she knew we were upset, but she really couldn't care less. Maybe it was her last day and she just stopped caring? Whatever the case, we will not be back.  Do not come here. Go to Islands down the street.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=100

I am a loyalty member of Red Robin and always get emails with new deals that they are having.  Overall, Red Robin has great burgers, yummy bottomless fries, and great service. The last time I was here was with my mom, aunt and my boyfriend. I wish I remembered our servers name, because he was amazing! He kept coming to check up on us, and refilled our drinks constantly. The burger I got was too spicy and I told our server and he offered me another burger that was not spicy, and was so quick to bring it out too!  He also split our check in two separate transactions, so we can get maximum discount. And I didn't even ask him to do this! He was really nice, and attentive to us.

What the heck is wrong with the quality of the burger meat here? The buns were crumbling apart. The meat tasted like a generic office backyard bbq meat that had been previously frozen. Something is just off about this place. One other gripe I had was when we were seated. A party of 2 before us was sat in a long booth that could easily sit 6. We (party of 3) were sat in the back in one of the smaller booths. My husband is not a small guy (6'1"", muscular build), and I had to squeeze next to him as my brother sat across from us. Whatever.

Denise V.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",15,4,1,1.0,6/17/2016,"I AM SO FUCKING PISSED!! I went to red Robin and ordered a vegan Boca burger. The server was awesome and very knowledgable and accommodating. I get my food, cut the burger in half and start eating. I notice what I thought was mushrooms under my grilled onions. I pulled them out because I don't like them. I keep eating. I get to the second half and find black beans, weird, I pull them out and keep eating. Henry at this point took my son to the restroom. I finish eating and then thought about how some vegans have mentioned finding meat in their food and I freeze. I think, ""No, someone couldn't have possibly done that to me..."" I inspect the beans and stuff I had pulled out and sure enough I found a chunk of ground beef. What. The. Fuck. Seriously?? I immediately call over the server and told him and he looked mortified!! He ran off and told a kitchen manager. He comes over and I explain and he is apologetic and says that never should have happened and that he would take it off the bill. I sit there and it just starts bugging me more and more. Henry comes back and I tell him what happened. He is instantly pissed (he's 90% vegan). As I talk to him it bugs me more and more and my server comes back and I tell him that I'm really upset because I could have been allergic to meat or something and that they don't know why I have dietary restrictions. He said he would let them know again. This time the manager comes by and I explain what happened and that its fucked up to do that to someone and that many vegans get very sick after eating meat because we don't have the enzymes to digest it anymore. He asks what he can do to make it better. And I told him I wasn't trying to get free food out of it, that I just wanted to make sure this wouldn't happen to someone else. He said that he understood and that someone was going to be leaving his kitchen. That there were only 4 guys that handled the Boca burgers and allergen section. He said whether accidental or not it was unacceptable and that they were opening an investigation. He said a manager was already on the phone with corporate in the back and that I could have the number to corporate so that I could follow up. I took the card and you better believe I'll be calling to follow up.  whether you're vegan or not it's not right to fuck with someone's food. What if I was allergic to something (like peanuts) and someone snuck it in there to be mean and I ended up having an allergic reaction and had to go to the hospital or I died?! They're being paid to cook something a particular way, not to bully someone and violate their rights! I will never be returning to red robin, I was a frequent customer but this was unacceptable.

Angela A.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,3,1,1.0,5/28/2016,"My mum, her friend and I were deciding to eat at a sushi place one nice Sunday to have brunch but instead we decided to go to red robin's since it always caught my eye.  So we went and we were very excited since it was our first time. We got immediately served by a waitress and she sat us down and when we did I noticed there was a fork on the floor.  I was like ok, and we didn't think much of it.  Then the server asked what would we like, so we ordered and I wanted to try the regular fries and the garlic fries for an extra .99... We agreed. We got the fries and the regular ones were so stale and nasty. The garlic fries lacked flavor. We ordered another batch of both of them and they came back the same. We were waiting and we decided to play the free games they had on the screens, and we were unaware that they charge you $2 for games. (Always read the fine print!)  Our waitress walked by and she didn't ask if we wanted refills or napkins, as a matter of fact she didn't ask how we were doing and what we needed!!! We also had the light to signal a waitress/waiter and they all kept walking by. I eventually found the waitress and asked her if she can get me more water and when she came back, she spilled the water on me, and said oops, sorry. It got me furious and pissed off. It looked like she wanted to laugh and I had to honestly keep my cool about this. She didn't look like she wanted to work, because she was in the back just talking to an older man.  We brought this to the managers attention and a middle aged Asian lady came by to see what was going on and then she said she was going to come back but never did. Instead a man named Sherwin came by and he said he was the manager and he was going to attend to us here on out. We were grateful for him helping us, we got a 7-8 dollar discount including removing the game charge and we were out of there.  Although Sherwin helped us out and he was nice and patient about it all,  This will be our first and last time that we will be there. Very bad waitresses.

Samantha W.,"Burbank, CA",0,2,,3.0,10/12/2016,"The food was pretty good, but it was incredibly difficult to get the attention of any of the three people working the front. Our official waiter was supposed to be working the other side and, while he was enthusiastic and friendly, we almost never saw him. The two women who were working on our side of the restaurant didn't seem to notice we were looking for help, and never looked over to check. On a couple occasions, I had to walk over to them to ask them for service which, while I don't mind doing so, seemed like it should not have been needed since ethe restaurant was not especially busy (at leats on the side I was sitting on).  I didn't think the food took very long to arrive, but the woman from the kitchen seemed to think so. She let me know that my food was cooked the way I'd asked, but then proceeded to let me know that my order was why it 'took so long.' Which, while I understand was likely an accurate explanation, seemed to be an unneeded rude comment since it mainly just heavily implied that my order had been an inconvenience to her. I know she may not have been super excited to be there; some days in a restaurant are tough, but I always hate to see it taken out on a customer. Overall, my dining experience wasn't too bad; I would come back. I'm hoping it was an off day for many of the people working there since I've been there in the past and had better experiences.

I don't like to be the person to complain, especially when it's just little things... But the first time I came here, our server didn't speak up at all and ended up getting my order wrong. I was so hungry that I just told them to not worry about it because my friends burger came already and I was just ready to eat. Thankfully, they gave me my food for free so that definitely made up for that. They also sent out a manager to apologize (which was cool, but maybe getting my order right from the start would have been cooler haha).  Anyways, so I went again last night, and I felt like my server was rushing me and it sort of made me grumpy, which is a shame because I really enjoyed my Whiskey River BBQ burger.

In all seriousness, the burger was really good! I ordered it well done, and they listened! Praise! Usually when I order, they still undercook it. This burger has fried jalapeño bits, which weren't spicy at all! It also came with pepper jack cheese, and a whole jalapeño on top!(best part, it was actually spicy)  I really like their fries, mainly because I liked dipping them in the sauces! I had the Thai spicy and sweet sauce. It gave the fries that extra kick!  It was pretty busy on a Wednesday evening. Still, Bianca was able to keep us happy and do her job efficiently.

Frank Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,37,8,4.0,7/10/2015,"Red Robin has always been great - but the server usually disappears once your food has arrived. I always suspected the bottomless fries to be the culprit. It seems like they would intentially hide so that you wouldn't ask them for fries after you've finished the first five they serve with your meal. Your server will be prompt and friendly in taking your order and will hide out while you eat. Once you've finished they are back again to ask if you'd like dessert, as if they were hiding and watching from afar.  However, service was definitely MUCH better tonight. I'm not sure if our waitress Bianca was new, or if there was a change in policy. She was very nice and helpful right from the start. Gave some good recommendations on the menu (by the way, the garlic fries are just fries with garlic ground onto them but they taste so much better). For the first time, we were checked in on every so often to make sure everything was OK. She offered to bring fries before we even thought of asking - I was astonished.  As for the food, great as usual... I think. I'm not sure if the D.G.B. burger is supposed to be served in a puddle of its own grease. The bottom bun was definitely soaked through and the arugula leaves were dripping - but it still tasted great. As I mentioned, the garlic fries are worth the upgrade especially if you ask for a side of garlic aioli.  I always drop by every now and then but if the service continues to be anything like what Bianca has shown us tonight, I will definitely be eating here more often!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=80

Our server was friendly too, he talked to us and helped us with our order.

That's my regular order. The burger is good. It's a decent size... About half a pound. The american cheese and the bacon with shredded lettuce and some tomatoes really top it off. They usually pack me a small plastic container of ranch dressing to go with the fries/onion rings. I keep forgetting to just let them know that all i need is a lot of ketchup...

Henry T.,"Burbank, CA",29,81,17,2.0,11/29/2015,"The customer service here has definitely gone downhill. It could really use a revamp. The new kiosks with games now at each table that are supposed to improve your ""service"", are just a excuse to provide even less interaction with less staff. Obvious ploy to try and save on labor costs. Kiosks are convenience when paying if they would work properly. Have gone a couple times and it has only worked properly once. Two times it was out of paper, one time it would not read my rewards card and apply the appropriate discount. If you're going to introduce new technology, make sure it works. Maybe this place needs some new management to return it to the restaurant it once was. Food is still good and unlimited fries are appreciated, even though the initial side of fries they bring you are considerably smaller than before since they use a small metal ring to supposedly improve the astethic look of the burger when it arrives. The refill will be the plastic tray as they used to do with all sides of fries.

Christian F.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,7,,1.0,11/12/2014,"I took the time to download the app so I could write this, I just want you to have an idea of how motivated I was by my experience here.  Last night me and my boyfriend were running errands around the Glendale Galleria and decided we'd splurge on a sit down dinner at Red Robin. Both of us have had good experiences with this establishment (not necessarily this location)  In order to bypass the wait we sat in the bar area, we didn't have a drink menu so we made our food selections first and when the waiter came by we ordered our food and a drink menu.  I got a ""sand in my shorts"" and Jerred got a Blood Orange Margarita, both were delicious, however I wish I had savored it more. We placed out orders roughly at 7:30... At 8:50 ONE AND A HALF HOURS LATER we FINALLY received our food, after watching several customers get up and leave without getting anything. I had ordered a chicken sandwich with a side salad, Jerred had ordered a burger (which they had to downgrade to a petite because they didn't have the normal sized patties) note to restaurants, if you don't have the requested item, upgrade them for free.  Needless to say we were starving when the food finally arrived. Jerred ordered the second round of his bottomless fries immediately, unsure of how long those would take.  After eating our meals entirely and waiting ANOTHER 15 minutes, our waiter somehow managed to make it to our table to say that the fries would be a little longer. We took the check.  The restaurant didn't seem super busy, and I get that sometimes this happens, but after all that j expected a comped drink, or a dessert sent out way (not that I would have wanted to wait for it) no dice. Just a ""visit us again soon, guys"" as our waiter shrunk bank to the kitchen in what I hope was shame. Needless to say I will NOT be coming back.

Jeff B.,"Los Angeles, CA",617,801,7330,5.0,12/17/2011,"(Dined 12/16/11 F): Red Robin is simply one of my favorite chain restaurants (and that's saying a lot for me!) with wonderful burgers and unlimited fries! After an evening of Christmas shopping, I met up with a friend for dinner and some catching up. It's been awhile since I've had the pleasure of eating at Red Robin (and I love the Glendale location), which to me is a travesty in itself. This location seems to have so much more space than others I've been to. After having to wait for about 15 minutes to be seated (gave us a chance to begin catching up), we got a booth in the bar area, and I taking the seat facing the TV so I can catch whatever sports was showing. Our affable waiter, Derek, was immediately on us offering to take our drink order. After the customary water, I decided to take advantage of their evening happy hour (yes, you read that correctly, as I've always been harping about how unjust it is not to have extended happy hours...8pm-close Monday-Friday in this case), and ordered a frozen mango margarita ($3.50) while my friend a bottomless raspberry iced tea ($2.89). I've had both before, so needless to say, they both are thirst-quenching. You get real pulp in the mango margarita!   The rest of the meal consist of happy hour ""zukes & shrooms"" with ranch and sweet Thai sauce (fried zucchini and mushrooms - $5.00), the Sweet Jim Beam burger with unlimited fries ($9.79) for me, and the fish & chips ($11.99) for my friend. With the exception of the new Sweet Jim Beam burger, I've eaten everything else before, and as always, all very scrumptious. However, I would have liked a bigger portion of the zukes & shrooms. The fish & chips was a bountiful basket of steaming fish...bite-after-bite-after-bite. As for the burger, the size seemed a bit scaled down from their other burgers. However, the meat was perfectly prepared medium and all the rest of the toppings wasn't so overbearing. Although, I wouldn't complain if they wanted to use more Jim Beam. I would suggest even a little container with extra Jim Beam sauce on the side, like what TGI Friday's does with their Jack Daniels burger.   The service was great, even at this busy dinner time. Our waiter, Derek, had a great personality, was always checking on us if we needed more drinks, and filled out water glasses when they were getting low. If you get him, make sure to tip him well; he deserves it. Parking is ample since you are in the Glendale Galleria, located on the first floor close to Target. Overall, as I already prefaced, I love Red Robin. They offer a wide range of burgers (that's all I come here for), but they also offer salads, sandwiches, and full-meal entrees. Another fine dining experience with value-priced food (total bill before tip was about $36.00). Although they have unlimited fries, I have yet to ever request for more. And they take my credit card of choice...AMEX!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=120

Bryan G.,"Alhambra, Los Angeles, CA",127,33,8,2.0,12/27/2015,"Went to this location for dinner on a Saturday night. Being the day after Christmas we excepted it to be pretty busy and were prepared for a wait. When we arrived the hostess told us it would be approximately 20 minutes. 20 minutes is a fairly short time for a Saturday for a party of three. 10 minutes later a server comes by and discusses with her about open tables, which lead to us being seated. We then over bearded the server discussing the arrangement of the tables and were switched servers but were never notified.  Honestly I don't care about being notified I just would like to know who I need to flag down because the entire night it felt like we had to keep playing where's Waldo because she never brought anything to our table. Starting with ordering food and then asking for utensils and napkins once they brought our appetizer which should be a given. I mean we only ordered the onion rings but at least bring us some freakin' napkins. She passed by several times and could clearly see what was on our table because we were in front of the kitchen, but she just seemed so ignorant and blind as to what we needed. Other workers were more helpful with refills. It was not only the server but the kitchen as well because I order medium for my burger and my girlfriend order medium-well, and both our burgers were burnt on the edges are were extremely dry. We felt sick after eating those burgers but we were waiting 30 mins for our food that we were just staring, after am approximately 50 minute wait period from the moment we walked in. I guess the overall timing on when we arrived was bad because it was just about 90 minutes before closing but I feel like there should be no excuse for the way the food should be cooked. As far as the waitress, I would rather wait an additional 20 minutes for a table, then to be seated early and receive A has ass service, with a waitress who seems to try to avoid our tables which is right in front of the kitchen (That table being the easiest to accommodate for since everything is so close). I do not hold this against the store or the establishment of Red Robins because there burgers have always been good, but I'm just very disappointed that someone could receive such a unsatisfying burger and service from a Red Robins...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=140

I looked online to see what boca burgers were supposed to look like...no where near what I got. That and the bartender was so short with me.

Derek S.,"Los Angeles, CA",220,90,193,3.0,2/25/2014,"Came here the other day with my Bro & friend. It wasn't my 1st choice but majority rules so we ate here. This restaurant location has kind of a strange lay out structurally which I imagine can't make it very easy for the servers when it gets busy. Luckily it wasn't busy so service was no issue. My friend ordered the BBQ wrap ($10), My brother got the Chicken Bruschetta sandwich on Ciabatta ($12.50) & I got the Simply Chicken sandwich ($9). They both opted for bottomless steak fries & I tried to be healthier and got the ""fruit"" salad. My friend loves the wrap & ordered it without ranch and honey mustard on the side... I clearly heard him say this but his wrap came with the ranch on it, which if you are trying to be healthier you know that ranch instantly makes the sandwich 2X as bad for you. Anyway my friend is too nice and didn't want to complain/have it sent back... that doesn't mean I can't put it on yelp though right?! Our server was nice and everything else service wise was fine besides this.  My brother loved his chicken bruschetta sandwich, and the steak fries were good and the waitress kept them coming. My sandwich was simple and good, just what I wanted, however the fruit salad was very forgettable and anything but fresh. If I had known it was basically out of the can I would have just gotten the fries heads up to those of you debating getting the fruit salad here. This is a good spot to stop for a chicken sandwich or a burger if you are ok with spending $15 per person. We enjoyed most of our food some minor issues but overall fine casual dining experience. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but if I am at the Galleria again and a group wants to stop here I wouldn't be opposed either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=140

There was a large birthday party ahead of us, and they let us know right away that there might be a short delay. Because they told us, we were happy to wait. We didn't have to wait long at all for our food, which was delicious. I had the chicken tortilla soup, and it was fantastic.

The service is always really poor and the food takes forever and isn't very good.  This past visit was the worst yet. We waited a really long time for our food. My friend had ordered a burger well done, but it had pink in it. The bacon cheeseburger came without bacon and my gluten free burger came on a regular bun. We didn't receive discounts for any of this, and the waiter brought me a dry gluten free bun with nothing on it so I could move the burger over. He also switched our credit cards when we paid our checks.

Hailey Z.,"Glendale, CA",301,626,508,3.0,4/28/2012,"This is Red Robin. Nothing spectacular can really be expected here. Food is good, service is always hit or miss. My past experience here wasn't fabulous but wasn't horrible either.  Came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch, we were greeted, given a table and a high chair for my friends daughter. I know that the waitress we had was really busy, I was watching her and could tell that the amount of tables she had was a tad overwhelming, so for that, I can cut her some slack. She was nice and you could tell she was really trying to make everyone happy. Can't complain about that.  I ordered the blackened chicken sandwich, fries and I got a side salad with ranch. My friend ordered the buffalo chicken fingers and salad, and a corn dog and fries for her daughter off the kids menu. The chicken sandwich I got was mediocre, I wouldn't get it again. I enjoyed the buffalo chicken tenders more than my meal. I was disappointed that our salads weren't at our table before our meal though, like we had asked. Again, waitress was overly busy so I wasn't going to complain.  She brought the check and forgot to order a to go order we were taking home to a friend of ours. I had to remind her of that, she was very apologetic, and of course I understood and reminded her that I know shes very busy which I think relieved her. I waited around while my friend took her daughter next door to Target while I paid for us. I asked for change and instead she charged all of it to my bill and brought that change. Ugh. Maybe I wasn't thorough though, so I had to tell her that the change I wanted was so I could pay for my share. She was very quick to give me all of the change and I put my cash in and gave my friends card to pay for her share. In counting the change back, I realized that she had short changed me $20.  Waitress came back with the to go order and the bill. Before I could even tell her about the $20, she opened the bill up and told me that I had accidentally put the $20 in there. I really appreciated that as I must have done that by accident, as I know that most people wouldn't risk their jobs for an extra $20, and I let her know that it wasn't a problem, I just appreciated that she was very quick to point it out and it made me feel bad that I think she thought I would complain about her regarding the ordeal. If anything I wanted to let a manager know how hard I saw her working to please all the tables she was waiting on and had a good attitude while doing it. I would definitely come back here during a less hectic time to try another dish.

When it came time to pay I paid on the little tablet they have at the table I swiped my debit card and left her 9 dollars tip cash !

I'm sure she saw her tip as a server I know we stay on top of our tips ! And if someone were to pass buy and take it why not try and use it at the 200  plus stores at the  galleria I'll tell you why because the dumb b*#^{h  had to wait till she got off work and by that that time the galleria stores were closed and why not use it safely at home where no cameras will catch her  !!

We had to ask the host for silverware and napkins. We ordered bottomless root beer and lemonade but the waitress rarely came to our table so we didn't even get a second refill. The guacamole was brown. The waitress did give us a new guacamole but no new chips. The waitress blamed the kitchen and said that they were super busy but we got to the restaurant at the end of the dinner rush and tables were leaving. Our fries were cold and the soup didn't come with the bread because the kitchen was behind. The waitress rarely came to our table. When I asked her for the check I told her we needed to leave and she still took 2 minutes. As soon as she gave it to me I gave it right back with my credit card and told her to please take it. When she brought our check back she brings us the soup bread in a to go box and apologized for the third time. The apology was very fake with no emotion and I did not want the bread to take home. The bread is thin and cut in to triangles, it is not a special bread that you crave after you leave the restaurant.

Andrea S.,"Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, CA",86,28,,1.0,11/10/2015,Absolute terrible service and terrible food. Our waitress hardly paid any attention to us. It wasn't even busy. 15 minutes to get two drinks? And I'm not even exaggerating. We told her we were ready to order and she seemed to have forgotten about us because we had to flag her down again ten minutes later. We came to celebrate a birthday but she made the experience awful thanks for that. We had a couple people join us after and it took them 20 minutes to get their drinks again no exaggeration. The waitress finally seemed to care when I started talking to the manager. I'm a server and a manager at a restaurant so I'm very understandable and patient but this was just terrible. Our orders came out all wrong too and it was cold and fries were stale. The only person who seemed to help us and cared was the male host. We planned on getting dessert for my husbands birthday but after food taking 30 minutes and hardly any attention from our server we skipped it. She couldn't even get us the napkins we asked for. They need to not hire inexperienced servers because they are going to lose customers that way. I was 9 months pregnant and tackling the whole restaurant serving by myself with no complaints from any table. If she can't handle a few tables with basic needs then you guys need better servers. Never coming back again. ----my mom paid for dinner she just checked her bank statements and she got charged twice!!! Really?!

It's basically the only sit-down restaurant in the Glendale Galleria, so it's nice to be able to take a load off after some shopping. Yesterday I went back for the first time in over a decade, and it was a disappointing experience. The food is not bad. In fact, the bottom-less steak fries are really good. They serve your basic hearty and unhealthy burgers, sandwiches, and a variety of fried stuff (onion rings, zucchini, clam strips, fish, etc.). It's not easy to mess up this basic fare, and they don't. But the service ruined an otherwise good meal. I know this is not the Ivy, and I'm not expecting 5-star service here. But I would like to have my drink refilled once in awhile or even a quick ""how you guys doing?"" But our waitress all but disappeared during our meal. We had to wait forever to get our drinks, have our order taken, and have our check delivered. The ONLY time the waitress acted nice was when she brought the check, no doubt hoping for more than a 4-cent tip. There seemed to be a morale problem with the wait staff in general.

Kenneth S.,"Glendale, CA",45,98,9,2.0,2/9/2015,"Not worth it. I took my family to Red Robin yesterday, and the two stars are for the friendly service. I ordered a Gardenburger with green chili and pepper jack. For almost ten bucks, the burger was on the small side. It tasted OK. The bottomless fries -- well, they start you with a small amount. They tasted fine. No one ever offered to bring more, although I'm sure they would have if we'd asked. My wife got a Gardenburger and asked for the ""freckled fruit"" on the side. We asked our server why it was called freckled fruit, and she said she had no idea, maybe the strawberry seeds? It didn't matter, because they messed up and brought her fries instead of the fruit. My son got a kid's grilled cheese with that infamous ""freckled fruit,"" which turned out to be a tiny little ramekin of mushy-looking fruit. Was it compote or fresh fruit? Couldn't tell, and my son didn't want to touch it. Our Cokes were $2.79 each -- only order those if you plan to drink a lot of it! (And yes, they did bring us refills promptly throughout the meal.) Overall, the food at Red Robin is edible, but the prices are verging on too high for what you get. For my money, I'd say Islands has better food when you're out looking for a burger. Islands is right across the street from the Glendale Galleria, so that's where I'll head next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=180

Kudos to him!  I even flagged down his manager to complement him. Ryo was very knowledgeable of the menu, and very kind and attentive. Drinks were always full, fries were always being refilled. Great waiter. The burgers were delicious. At least I though so at first. I had the jalapeno burger and my boyfriend had the guacamole bacon burger. So why the one star?

First our drink order was wrong and that was because our waitress didn't write any our order down. Then we order and one of our orders came out with the wrong cheese on the burger so they took it back which was nice. Then we get the order back and we find out that all they did was tear the cheese off because there was still cheese on the bottom of the bun and then to top it all off, when we got it back, the sandwich was chicken, not beef, which it was before. And our waitress seemed very put out that there were issues. And then argued with us about what we ordered.

Ryan C.,"Los Angeles, CA",96,161,1199,3.0,10/23/2008,"I've been to the Glendale Galleria countless times especially as a kid growing up, but I never experienced dining in at Red Robin until today. Today we got dinner.. And a show. The show consisted of the fire that was started up outside of the building when there neon sign burst into flames. Seems that the ""E"" in ""RED"" caught fire maybe due to a short circuit. The chaos and pandemonium of all the employees running around holding extinguishers had the customers wondering what was up... and before you know it, we and 4 other tables were told to move to another booth since the fire marshall requested they evacuate one side of restaurant for our safety. It was all good, we picked up our drinks and moved along.. the only thing that was on my mind was ""these 10 dollar burgers better be worth it"". Soon after, LAFD arrived and put out the weak flames.  On to the food.. I ordered the shroom swiss burger.. she asked how would I like it cooked.. so of course ""medium"". I like my beef juicy and a tad bit rare in the center. The burger was great and comparable to the Hula burger they offer at Islands, but here they don't mess around and use a massive amount of shrooms which I definitely enjoyed. The best way I can put it is that the slices of shrooms were stacked inside the burger like poker chips (it was assembled perfectly, I know, I should have taken a pic, but that's what happens when your starving and way too excited) ... they had to have used at least 10 whole mushrooms for each burger. TERRIFIC!  They also come with bottomless steak fries which were also great. An extra half star (3.5) for having a seasoned salt shaker on each table... Its always good when you can add as much salt seasoning goodness on your fries as you please. I also thought that I would be able to devour at least 3 baskets of fries, but after the first batch you could have stuck a fork in me cause I was done. Of course each of us still ordered another batch of fries because it's a must when you know there bottomless and that was another reason why I wanted to try this place out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=260

After standing for over 10 minutes waiting for Steven or some other waiter to approach me the same waiter returns because there are other people behind me again and instead of 1st saying I'm sorry did Steven take your order... He says good evening ladies and was about to walk away when I said 'sorry but is anyone going to help me'? He say I told you Steven will help you-Steven at the Bar and I told you 3 times' pointing his 3 fingers out to me!!! OMG!!!! Really? I said 'u never said to go to the bar'.As if I know who Steven is!!! Bad customer service. I was treated very poorly and felt like I was a NO body just because I was taking out and not dining in. The fact that Steven ended up helping me with my order which I ordered a good amount worth I ended up tipping Steven pretty well for being nice and taking my order.

She responds that there's no server for the other table but then offers up the table to a party of 3 a few minutes later compared to our party of 7. Took the time to count, waiter was decent, I believe she was offended by one of my friends remarks but she didn't purposely try to ruin our service. Burgers took at least 10 minutes to come and it wasn't even busy at the time. While eating, we asked for more baskets of Bottomless fries and they took forever to come. ( At the SD one I've been too, they would have been here instantly.) I ordered the A1 peppercorn burger for the first time. Honestly.. it felt like I was eating meat from a microwavable pizza. It was tasteless and just had no flavor at all. I ended up picking at it while waiting for the infinity time it took for the bottomless fries to come. Friend ordered the burning love burger and from personal experience, it isn't a great choice either. NOT spicy and the whole burger just ends up kinda soggy.

Melissa A.,"Austin, TX",132,191,38,3.0,11/22/2011,"My bf wanted to try this place out, so I went along with it. Apparently in Ohio, they have good burgers.  The decor was very similar to what you would see in a normal chain restaurant, very similar to Applebees, but admittedly slightly nicer, and more spacious.  My bf ordered a coke, and I ordered a skinny margarita. The skinny margarita was great. For $6.49 it was a pretty nice drink.  We ordered the nachos as an appetizer, which where reasonably priced, and I did like that they separated our order into two plates for us, but on the other hand, the nachos where kinda dry. Not the worst nachos in the world, but not the best. Next came our actual entrees, I ordered the Red Robin Gourmet Cheeseburger with sweet potato fries, and my bf ordered the Burnin' Love Burger with steak fries. Both our burgers were cooked medium, and we both agreed, that for what they were, we'd rate them a 6 out of 10. They aren't your typical fast food burgers, but somewhere around the realm of diner style burgers. I'm not sure I would call them ""Gourmet"" but they were good. Our server brought over some water for me, which was a plus since I hadn't even asked for a water. The manager then walked around with the kitchen chef and asked if our meal was ok. It was a little awkward since I tried to compliment the food, but the chef seemed so annoyed that he had to do this. Our server had weird timing, and appeared in complete dismay when my bf said he didn't want another coke. I personally would have just brought the new soda over, seeing how I now find out at HOME that his soda was unlimited. We specifically asked him in the beginning what the drink specials were. I figured that if they had unlimited refills of soda, that would be one of the first things mentioned when asked about drink specials. He could have taken the menu and recommended one or two or his favorites, and directed us to where we could find more information, but he didn't. He also didn't ask if I had wanted another drink, more fries (aren't they supposed to be bottomless?) or if we even wanted desert. He just placed the check on the table, proceeded to occasionally walk by and glance at our plates. At first I thought, well maybe the poor guy just wants to go home and its the end of his shift, but then I over heard that he was infact one of the closers for the evening. With your section not being full, the restaurant not being packed, and you being one of the closers of the evening, having more then enough time....why rush us?  We also sat right next to one of the servers computer systems, which my bf and I got to occasionally hear the servers gather /huddle over and gossip about the customers. Maybe this wouldn't have happened, if Red Robin had a manager that focused more on his staff  then forcing his chef to prance around the restaurant begrudgingly. Our meal came out to $40 and though our server lacked in some ways, he did check back on us occasionally, and seemed sincere when asking if our meals where ok, so having been a server myself (back in the day) I decided that he must well intentioned but somehow inexperienced even though they apparently have him as a closer. I left him 20%, which put our meal at $48-49.  My advice, come here during happy hour, and only during happy hour, otherwise it is completely not worth it. This place is between 2-3 stars. Three for the happy hour specials and the alright food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=240

I tried to call to talk to a manager, but they put me on hold for such a long time that I ended up hanging up and calling back.  This time I waited for awhile before someone told me that they were too busy to talk to me, and I should call back another time.  I told them about my burger so they made sure it didn't happen to someone else, and they just curtly replied ""sorry"" before hanging up.  They didn't even offer to make it up to me. If you plan on eating inside you can at least make sure they get your order correct, so here's what I recommend: Garden Burger: Only this burger has the Garden Burger patty -if you substitute any other meat patty for a vegetable one, they'll use a Boca Burger patty because it's cheaper, which doesn't taste the same. Whiskey River BBQ Burger:  Personally I don't like all of those onion straws, so I ask to replace them with their ""angry onions"" instead.  I think they're healthier anyway. Lone Star Burger:  You notice that this isn't on their menu.  It used to be popular 10 years ago, and most of the chefs remember how to make.  If you ask nicely they'll usually make it.  I forgot all that's on it, but I remember it does had pepper jack cheese and jalapenos! Spicy Clucks and Fries:  These strips are so spicy you can smell them coming!  Delicious though -just make sure you have a drink around and plenty of ranch or blue cheese dressing to cut down that crazy sauce! Speckled Lemonade:  Strawberry peach lemonade with chunks of frozen strawberries in it, and served in a fun swirly glass!  Yum. Garlic Parmesan Fries:  Sooo much better than their regular fries -covered in pieces of garlic, shaved parmesan cheese and parsley!  I prefer to dip them in blue cheese dressing! Great place for kids and groups, and the prices are worth the amount of food you get!  The fries and drinks are bottomless too!  Also they have a great website where you can customize your burger, and it will tell you how many calories it will have!  The high calorie count is shocking, but don't beat yourself up too much......you can make it up to yourself by having salads the rest of the week.  ;) FYI:  Stay away from the clam chowder -it's nasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=240

OUR WAITRESS WAS NICE AND ATTENTIVE, WHICH DESERVED  THAT SINGLE STAR.  MY COUSIN ORDERED THE BCB W/FRIES AND A LIMEADE.. I HAD THE MAC&CHEESE WITH SALAD AND RANCH DRESSING..(although i requested my salad to be caesar, i guess it was a good thing i also Like ranch!) he consumed the burger.. we parted ways cause he had to be at work by 3:30.  texted me 20 minutes later that he felt weird and was not feeling well at all. I did not think much of it cause he's a hefty individual. A few hours later, i receive a call from my mother who had told me he was vomiting consistently and could not even talk nor move! I called him and he asked for me to call The Restaurant.. SO I DID! I ASKED TO SPEAK WITH THE MANAGER, BY THIS TIME IT WAS AROUND 6pm.  HE WAS A COMPLETE JERK. INSINCERE AND COLD. THERE IS A STRAIGHT REASON WHY HE IS THE *MANAGER* OF ""THIS ESTABLISHMENT"" AND NOT AN   M.D -- FIRST I TOLD HIM WHAT TIME WE DINED IN AT, WHAT WE ORDERED, AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED.. HE THEN STARTED TO GIVE ME SMART REMARKS, LIKE ""IT HAS ONLY BEEN 4 HOURS, USUALLY WITH FOOD POISONING IT TAKES 8-12 so there is no way it could be from my burgers.

My boyfriend and I weren`t in the mood for burgers at the time, but I ended up getting the Guacamole Bacon Burger (minus bacon), my boyfriend got the Prime Rib Dip, and his niece and nephew both got the kids pizza with apples. What I love about Red Robin is that their big steak fries are bottemless, so the fries are always coming. My Guacamole Burger was okay. It was cooked nicely medium with a pink center so it was juicy, however the guacamole was missing something. I couldn`t even tell that it was there. My boyfriend`s Prime Rib Dip was good. I actually liked it better than what I ordered. The sandwich had sliced prime rib that was tender and juicy, with carmelized onions and provolone cheese. It also comes with an au jus dipping sauce. Dipping the sandwich in the au jus makes it all better because the baguette absorbed the au jus. Yum. The kids seem to enjoy their pizza very much. They ate everything. The kids meals come with a small kids drink that are bottemless as well. After we finished our meal, the waiter brought over an ice cream sundae and sang happy birthday to my boyfriend`s nephew.

The fries were under my fish and they were cold but the top of my fish were hot. So needless to say, the fries were gross. My fish were very greasy and mushy.

Lily T.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,44,,4.0,4/29/2012,"I never thought I would ever eat at a Red Robin, and this one in particular, because when I was a child we were at this mall and the Red Robin mascot stalked us all the way to the other side!  (In hindsight, I can almost talk myself into believing the person had just gotten off work and was heading to their car, but then I remember that he/she was in costume the entire length of the mall, so there was definitely something sinister going on :/)  But my friend and I were both craving burgers, and she wanted to eat at a Red Robin.  I looked up the menu online and it wasn't too bad so I decided to give it a try. She got the mushroom burger (something 'Shroom?) and I got the Bleu Ribbon burger.  Hers looked gross hahahahaha.  Granted, it didn't look all too appetizing on the website, but it looked a lot worse in person, I couldn't even look at it while I was eating :D.  On the other hand, mine was awesome :D.  I asked for medium well, and while I don't know enough to be able to tell if it was actually medium well, it wasn't overcooked (the first time I ever ordered a non-fast food burger I asked for ""VERY well done"" and it could've been used as a hockey puck) or undercooked (to me that means it doesn't look raw and definitely no oozing blood if I poked at it).  I loved how they cooked the onions (I don't really like onions, especially raw), I think they called it onion straws, they were like thinner and more lightly battered versions of onion rings.  The bun it was on was also really good, it was nice and soft too, definitely felt and tasted fresh. Our server was nice, he came by quite often to ask how everything was, but in a very polite manner that didn't make you want to scream ""stop bothering us!"" (I've had waiters who would refill your glass every time you drank more than an inch from the rim -______-  made me feel like they just wanted to eavesdrop on the conversation). They also had unlimited fries!  I didn't know that until the server asked if we wanted more fries, but by that time I was pretty stuffed.  I think the fries had more of a wedge shape (I prefer my fries in a stick shape lol, they just feel more like fries that way), I don't remember much else about them because I drenched them in ketchup :D, though I don't think they were dry, because no amount of ketchup can save fries that are dry.  Next time I'm going to eat all my fries first and get refills :D. I definitely want to eat at Red Robin again, if only to confirm this experience wasn't a fluke.  I want to try a chicken sandwich next time, and their cod sandwich too (I can't decide if it sounds delicious or if it sounds like a bad idea :D - it might be a better idea to just get fish and chips).  I also want to try their Cobb salad (I love Cobb salad), but I don't know if it's a good idea to get salad at a restaurant that prides itself on burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=280

Joseph M.,"Elk Grove, CA",10,45,151,2.0,1/31/2009,"I'm kinda overdue on this review for Red Robin as it hasn't been the first time I've been to this place or any of the other RR places in SoCal.  We mainly come here because of it's family-friendly atmosphere, unlimited steak fries and drinks.   If memory serves me correctly, this was the first place where I had a burger that had a fried egg in it.  The Royal Red Robin burger has been a favorite of mine since. On my most recent visit, I decided to try something different.  I went with the Prime Rib dip which also included the unlimited garlic Parmesan fries.  Sad to say, I was pretty disappointed.  The prime rib meat was not only dry but it tasted pretty old.  Nothing ""gourmet"" about this prime rib at all, I felt like I was eating roast beef sandwich.  The garlic parmesan fries was pretty weak as well.  The garlic/parmesan looked nothing more than just a simple side garnish.  I was thinking the fries would be covered/seasoned but it wasn't.  It was like taking their usual steak fry and scooping the garlic/parmesan garnish like you would dipping a fry in ketchup.  Was it good?  If it wasn't for the fact that I liked anything garlic/parmesan, I would've never gotten it had I known that's what I was gonna get.  A mouthful of garlic isn't exactly what I had in mind either. Another common item we order is the creamy artichoke and spinach dip.  I have had this many times in the past and never had I had it this bad.  It was very bland and tasted like paste.  Nothing creamy about it.  It was nasty.  We actually made a comment about it (not a real complaint) and they ended up taking it off our bill which was nice.   It's not often that we come here but when we do we usually have a pretty good meal/experience.  This past visit was just plain bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=300
Brian R.,"Burbank, CA",214,112,46,2.0,1/8/2008,"So I frequent the Red Robin in Calabasas, and I decided to try out this location with my girlfriend. There were only a few other people eating here when we sat down. First, I have no idea who our waiter/waitress/dog/cat was, because after we ordered I dont think I saw her again.  The food came out slow and NOT HOT. It was obvious it sat for awhile, which is INSANE since it wasn't busy. I ordered a drink, which was great, but after I drank it, I sat with no water, or beverage for the rest of the meal. I couldn't find anyone to order another drink, or even get a water. I had to get my own ketchup from another table, and after we finished, it took us 20 mins to track down someone to get our check (not even our waitress).  We wanted a togo box, but we gave up on that... and the change for our bill ($5) was left as a tip since we just wanted to get out of there, instead of waiting for change. So maybe thats how the wait staff gets their tips, they give you such bad service that you end up leaving before getting your change back! I could understand if the place was busy, but it wasn't. The food was ok, but I know its better at the other location. We also overheard another waiter selling food like it was a late night info-commercial, which made us feel gross.  ""So tell me what your favorite food is on the menu"" -the fake waiter ""Uhhh... the wings"" -customer looking confused as he sits down ""So let me put in a order of that for you..."" ""uhhh... no?""

Marcelo K.,"Glendale, CA",52,95,6,2.0,4/10/2008,"""Where to?"" ""I don't know...I don't know what I want"" ""Red Robin"" ""Fine""  Normally all you can eat fat fries and the best strawberry lemonade I tasted so far would always be worth going to, but my red robing days in Glendale are long gone long gone...why? SERVICE The Glendale location has a funny L shape to it, but maintains the movie poster, funny pictures, colorful lampshades, colorful booths motif that RR has going for themselves. It doesn't take them long to seat you, and you start thinking about you want.  I love their Royal Red Robin Burger because of the fried egg that they put in it. Then there's the peppercorn thing...I would always get sauce on the side because you don't know how much of it you like in your burger, and I bet each of the short order cooks puts a different amount. After a while I started buying the same thing, The Turkey Burger!!  I was not very impressed with the meat quality on this either, but it was juicy enough to eat. The main course of the RR meal really isn't the burger though. I think of the burger as a buffer for the fries. Try the fries cooked crispy, if they do it right, it should feel like you're eating mashed potatoes that have been packaged in kettle chips.  So that is my take on the food, but back to the 2 star rating and the service. The last time I went there, the fries did not come out as good as I was used to, and each basket was worse than the previous one. It felt like each fry had given up on being tasty, and brought down the other fry's confidence. It also didn't help that the Honey Mustard ordered tasted like watered down water with a hint of horrible flavor.

So we were on vacation and we were looking for a place that was decent and great for kids, so I suggested Red Robin's and this one was near our hotel. We got there and was seated right away. Our waitress was very friendly and served us promptly. We were all full and stated how good the burgers were. It was not until we got our check that our entire experience went down the drain. There was a bus-boy who was clearing a table right next to us. I look up and the bus-boy who was chewing tobacco spit directly into the bucket that he was collecting the dishes in. Then part of my other party said that they saw him do it again. Needles to say I have never been so disgusted in my life. We told our waitress and she asked if we would like to tell her manager. The manager came over, we told her. She just looked kind of puzzled and left our table. She never returned back to our table to say anything further about the situation. However our waitress did return just to say that the manager would speak to the bus-boy. While we were waiting for our change, we proceeded to get dirty looks for other waitress' as if we broke some sort of code for telling on this person. I will never frequent another Red Robin again.

I'm pregnant and was CRAVING fries and red robins are my favorite. But once we sat down at the bar, we knew our experience was going to be terrible. We are both in this industry, so we know what to expect when dining out and how we should be treated. First off, the older bartender Mike, took about 10 minutes to take our order, which seemed to be a big inconvenience to him. We had to ask for the bar to be cleaned, never got silverware, or refills. My fiancé got the quesadilla and I got just a regular cheeseburger. Mike kept wiping his nose and never once washed his hands and I watched him serve beer,glasses of wine, AND my finances sprite. DISGUSTING. We said please and thank u and never got a response from him. A server had brought back a martini that a guest didn't like and he made the biggest ordeal about it for nothing. I am a bartender and what the guest was asking for, which was for it to be colder, is about as simple as filling a glass of water. My fries I was craving was a child size handful, and when I asked for more, again, it seemed to be such an inconvenience. 10 minutes later, my Luke warm child sized handful of fries came. By this time, we were ready to go. Might I add, mike still never washed his hands. Mike was off doing whatever, and the server Derick came and cleared our plates and gave us our bill. I'd like to make a note that the 30 second experience we had with Derick was the only nice thing about our visit. Mike came and cashed us out, and we were off.

Tasha H.,"Portland, OR",223,243,9,4.0,3/13/2008,"yaaaaay i love bottomless fries! everytime i go here i can never decide what burger i want. never. i take like 20 mins and by that time the waiter is a pissy like ""what the hell is taking you so damn long?"". never had a bad experience here... the waiters/waitresses are super nice and on top of thier job and the food is always always good. get anything with the crispy onion pieces on it... your breath will stank but you'll enjoy it like its your last meal on earth!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=340
Sarah A.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,70,13,2.0,10/8/2008,"the food is ok, the waitstaff is friendly, but i swear on everything that once I ordered a salad and there was a LIVE LADYBUG IN IT. Not a joke. I was pretty grossed out. It was just crawling through the salad, having the time of it's life eating my food. WTF. If it had been any other bug rather than a ladybug I probably would have thrown up, but I think ladybugs were cute so I wasn't TOO upset.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=340

Syniah M.,"Pasadena, CA",6,93,,4.0,9/23/2008,"What I love about this place is that you can substitute a Gardenburger on any of their hamburgers. I get tired of the same ol' Garderburger offered at other places so variety is much appreciated. i had the ever so juicy BANZAI Burger sans the funny lookin' cheddar. The chocolate malt was hell-a good,  so damn good you feel naughty.But the bottomless fries looked like they were found at the bottom of something so I didn't eat them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=340
Rick K.,"Los Angeles, CA",132,552,22,4.0,4/7/2007,"2 words for you: UNLIMITED FRIES! and those aren't just any fries... THICK ONES TOO.  I usually don't write reviews on chains like Red Robins, but I think i'll make an exception this one time. Red Robins is one of those places you go when you want quality gourmet burgers and lot of fries. You will for sure come out of that place a pound or two heavier. haha. So if u are on a diet, dont plan on going there.  I personally like their Hawaiian bbq burger (and the blue cheese burger). But they have other great things as well.  The staff and service is outstanding, and you will hear animated waiters singing happy birthday there all the time.  5 stars for being the best burger joint ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=340
Sintiea S.,"New York, NY",119,332,,4.0,6/10/2007,Haven't been in agessss..but from what i remember it was pretty good. It's in a mall so you can't expect tooo much. But overall good food and good service.  Good place to go during the holliday season when the mall cafeteria is PACKED and you need to take a break from all that shopping.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=340
S. S.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,89,,3.0,3/20/2008,"Okay, so it's a chain.  But the turkey burgers are really good!  I don't eat a lot of this kind of food, so I'm picky and consider it a treat.  I am never disappoionted.  The service is fast and efficient, and the booths comfy.

Danny G.,"San Diego, CA",11,100,1,4.0,2/11/2008,The burgers are made with a thick ground beef. Their Mushroom Burger is the best. Unlimited fries that aren't bad at all.

T H.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,61,104,3.0,12/2/2008,"Nov. 29, 2008: After window-shopping at the Glendale Galleria, food was the next best thing.  We chose Red Robin, which I haven't been to in such a long time.  Glad that I got to return finally because I've been waiting to take on the bottomless fries that they have.  Me and two friends all ordered the Clucks & Fries.  It's a Red Robin specialty that includes the bottomless steak fries.  My friends all got the fries without salt and ate them with ketchup.  But for me, I got the garlic fries...hmmm garlic...all chopped up and diced into itty-bitty morsels and sprinkled atop.  Even so, the garlic taste was not too strong...it was enough of a kick to make it enjoyable.  The chicken fingers were crisp and well-proportioned cuts thrown into the right amount of peppered batter.  The ranch dressing went well with the garlic steak fries, which I prefer over ketchup sometimes.  If I wanted to switch it up, I could've easily ordered another basket of them anyways and eat them with other condiments so there's plenty of room for mistakes or experimentation!  I also felt like drinking a lemonade so I ordered the bottomless blueberry pomegranate limeade (made with Monin pomegranate), which was a new beverage on the menu.  The drink came in a beautifully aesthetic twist glass.  The glass was crafted and blown with a streak of red to accent the tastefulness that was about to be sipped.  A halved fresh lime wedges, squeezed and thrown in, added to the fizz from the Sprite mixed in.  The round blueberries were also swirled into different edges and layers of the cup along with the lime syrups.  I popped the blueberries in my mouth with the straw and it was so sweet!  This was a great yin-and-yang for the slight sourness that I was craving...no wonder Red Robin says in their menu that uncontrollable ""yummy"" noises might result from it!  For $3.99 and having to drink 3 cups...it was pretty worth my penny.  Plus, our waiter Erick was the perfect server because we didn't even ask for a refill and he brought a whole new cup, without getting our order wrong and right when we were about to finish our drink...such great timing!  Good, good, good...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=340
Lina O.,"Orange County, CA",404,485,1970,2.0,10/11/2008,"i usually have a good experience when i go to red robin in general. i ordered a lemonade. regular or strawberry? mmm... strawberry! my mom gets an iced tea. we order a onion ring tower and i get a california chicken burger and my mom gets some wrap. the strawberry lemonade was really good. the onion rings were pretty good. piping hot but a little salty. my chicken burger was... not so good. the bread was so dry and brittle, it fell apart when i tried to eat it. it made me feel like the bread was old. i dont know. then the bacon in it didnt even seem real. i dunno, maybe its always like that but it seemed like some precooked kind that they just have to heat up. did they even heat it up? i dunno. my moms wrap was ehh ok. she didnt even eat it. we had to decided if we really wanted to take the leftovers home, because would we even eat it at home? no. we got our check and OMG $40 freakin dollars?!? are you kidding me? geez. how come this time everything seemed so much more expensive? is it the economy? our waitress was friendly though. a little too rehearsed but eh ok. i felt like she got me when she asked me if i wanted strawberry lemonade or regular. and then again when she asked me if i wanted a refill. damnit!!! no free refills on the strawberry lemonade. i should have known.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=340
Jessica K.,"Los Angeles, CA",166,253,111,2.0,1/8/2008,"You know what. .i like this place a lot. Their french fries are great with the yummy red robin seasoning (almost a cajun spice to it) and i like how many of the orders come with melon but the service was just terrible at this location-maybe they were having a bad day? the place was not busy and there were a lot of staff but i honestly didnt know who our waitress/waiter was - REALLY was it a man or a woman? I think most of the time we were there, we were looking for someone or anyone to help us - at one point i had remembered the hostess' face and confused her for our waitress..the food took forever to come out, our condiments were not full on our table, the food was not as hot as i would like and the bbq sauce in my wrap was nothing to brag about (but being from the south i will give them a break). it was obvious that other people were not too enthused about their service either. We overheard a waiter that sounded like a car salesman..Annoying! Hopefully,( if we even go back) we will not get snubbed like this again and maybe the busser wont have to clean our table then bring us our check..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=340
