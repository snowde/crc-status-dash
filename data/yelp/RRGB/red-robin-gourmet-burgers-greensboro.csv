Robert Y.,"Greensboro, NC",497,377,267,3.0,7/30/2017,"I have never been a Red Robin fan, but after coming here several times with my coworkers, I am a convert. I really like coming to this place and I usually enjoy the food and the great service. I really have fallen in love with their grilled cheese sandwiches though, and I tend to order that with their French Onion soup, which is delicious.  The service here is excellent, and was on display recently when I had an issue with mold on my sandwich which I spotted and alerted the waitress about. This issue was rectified and the sandwich was replaced free of charge, though I couldn't really eat the second one because the chef put too much pepper on it which rendered it inedible. I didn't say anything because I didn't want to be seen as the guy who keeps sending his sandwiches back . I was very disappointed on that day. On a positive note, I did receive the meal free of charge, though I still paid for my appetizer.   I'm trying not to dock this place another star because the other visits were fantastic, but I'm more skeptical now, given my recent experience. On a positive note, I came up with a short jingle to honor my recent patronage to this establishment: Green Robin is the place to be If botulism is your fantasy",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensboro
Beverly B.,"Greensboro, NC",42,7,12,5.0,11/6/2017,"Ok they were so nice to invite me back to get the birthday celebration started! Had the Red Tavern Double with a twist! I added pepper jack cheese and avocado. It was served with its never ending fries. Was served nice and hot and their Original Seasoning topped them off great! Wonderful service and attentive staff made it a successful outing! Because I signed up for for their Royalty Rewards Program, mine was #FREE! But, the others in my party enjoyed theirs just as much. But, don't take my word for it, try it for yourself! And the Sweet Treats Dessert was shared by all....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensboro

Janet P.,"Greensboro, NC",14,10,,4.0,8/10/2017,"Today was my first time dining at RR. I had the Guacamole Bacon Burger; it was well cooked (a little pink like I like it) juicy, tasty, loaded with flavor and almost too much for one person. I enjoyed the endless salad and my daughter had the endless fries. Our birthday burgers!  Our server, DeAndre was exceptional. He explained the menu in detail, gave us tips about how to change things up if we wanted, showed us how to use the tabletop technology,  was attentive to our needs (drinks and side seconds) and took care of us!  He was the very best server we have had at ANY restaurant (fast food to fine dining) in a long time.

Sterling V.,"Greensboro, NC",13,9,6,2.0,11/2/2016,"mwh,.. is right,... Average burger with lots of fries if you put pressure on the server. Plates and accessories specially picked to make the sparse portions look more important. Ridiculous prices for frozen hamburger patties at over ten dollars per plate and ""special"" offers if you buy one, get one half off. Good birthday program, free burger on birthday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensboro
Nick D.,"Greensboro, NC",50,50,20,2.0,9/11/2016,"I am writing this Yelp to you while sitting on my toilet in shear agony and pain. This restaurant has many problems and few qualities that make me want to return. Our waiter looked like she fell in a tackle box due to her extreme amount of piercings which made me uninterested in eating. Her General hygiene was just appalling and disgusting, nothing personal to her however a well run restaurant would have some type of restrictions on how many hooks you can have through your nose. Now the food was good, my burger was thick and juicy (wink, wink). The steak fries were also good, very steaky. Now my last problem was the drinks. My dr.Pepper was obviously watered down and after the waitress brought me two I decided to just get sweet tea. But wait there's more! It was unsweet tea because I guess they didn't think they could make my experience worse. Never coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensboro
Sarah G.,"Raleigh, NC",70,433,279,3.0,7/18/2015,"We have not been to a Red Robin in about a year or more, and the last time was in NY. I think I rated it a 5-star. Today's visit was just ""average"" in my opinion. Cleanliness: I believe we arrived shortly after their lunch crowd left because the floors were filthy. Tons of food debris, used napkins, straw wrappers, etc littered the floor. It wasn't until we were about to leave that I saw an employee begin to start sweeping up the mess. Our table was kind of sticky as well. Atmosphere: Again, meh. I have been to a brand new RR before and it was classy... Almost ""too fancy to be a RR."" This location needs a definite update. The whole, ""TV in the floor"" upon walking in seems so dated and of course, it wasn't on anyways.  Food: I wasn't in the mood for a burger so I tried the California chicken sandwich and got it wrapped in lettuce instead of on a bun. It was pretty good. A little tough to eat on the lettuce but I managed. Like another Yelper mentioned, the ""bottomless fries"" was a measly portion. I only had one order brought out to me because I didn't want to feel like a pig asking for another but I could have gone for another 1-2 orders because there were so few given to me. I'm sure they do this to reduce waste because people probably ask for more and then don't eat them.  My husband got the Whiskey River Burger in a lettuce wrap... Originally the chicken version was brought out for him but the server caught that mistake before placing it in front of him. No big deal, the correct meal was delivered after a few more minutes. Again, he had a tough time with the lettuce wrap because it really wasn't a ""wrap"" it was more like 2 stacks of iceburg ""buns"" hence, when you'd bite into it, everything slipped out the backside. If it were actually WRAPPED in lettuce, it would have held it all in better. We ordered the meatball kids meal for our daughter with broccoli. The meatballs were pretty good. They came with these little breadsticks you could stab the meatball with to dunk it in the marinara sauce. She seemed to really enjoy them. The broccoli seemed to be not steamed enough... It was pretty hard still.  Service: Our server was ok. She was friendly but I felt like another server was at our table more than our actual one was. And after we were done eating, the bill was dropped and we waited sooooo long to have it picked back up... As our daughter was meting down because she wanted to leave .  All in all, I think I would try out another place around the area before returning to this RR location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensboro
Patrick H.,"Trinity, NC",80,138,90,4.0,12/1/2015,"I've always like Red Robin and this is the location I visit most often. The staff here is friendly and attentive on every visit so far. The restaurant is large and has its own style, right down to a television in the floor when you walk in. We opted to kick off the meal with pretzels with beer cheese. I was not disappointed, the flavor of the cheese rocked and the pretzels were soft and soaked it up nicely. For the main event, I opted to get the hottest burger Red Robin could throw at me, the firey ghost pepper tavern double. The burger was cooked perfectly, had a ton of flavor and was overall very delicious, but had virtually no heat. That's the issue I have with not just Red Robin, but most burger places I try. If I see ghost pepper/fire/volcano/molten/death in title of a burger, I want a my tongue to melt. The fries are awesome here, crisp, flavorful and my favorite part of all, ENDLESSLY ENDLESS. There were several sauces that you can choose from that are free for dipping,  and others with a small fee but more upscale ingredients.  Overall, I have not had a bad experience here, though it does hit me in the wallet abit hard being a bit overpriced. But as long as the service is consistent, burgers delicious and the fries ever flowing, I will return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensboro

Erik S.,"Greensboro, NC",87,211,198,3.0,12/9/2015,"If this is where you are going for your burger fix in Greensboro, you're doing it wrong. Get back in your car and go a mile down the road to the original Big Burger Spot and enjoy a much better burger combo than what you would get at Red Robin. That said, you could certainly do worse. There is something to be said for bottomless French fries if you're really hungry. It also helps they are the big wedge style steak fries. Burgers here are pretty good, if it weren't for a wealth of other locally owned and operated burger boutiques I could see it being one of the better spots to enjoy some Angus goodness. But, since those places do exist, I wouldn't recommend Red Robin to you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensboro

Kenny P.,"Eden, NC",3,22,,2.0,11/2/2016,"I went here for lunch today after coming form the doctors office.  I walked in, and had to stand around for about 5-6 mins before anyone acknowledged me, even though the waitresses kept looking over at me.  Finally a lady came over and took my order.  I ordered a chicken sandwich, chili cheese fries, and a drink.  I waited for my food a good 25 minutes before it was brought to me.  Let me add that this place was not busy at all either! After all of this, upon leaving I had tomatoes on my sandwich, which I asked them to be taken off.  The chili has big beans in it, and the fries were nasty honestly.  The price of the food is not worth what you get by far.  The customer service was horrible! I ordered a crispy chicken sandwich, chili cheese fries, and a drink that costed me 16.83 with tax.  I will probably never eat at a Red Robin again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensboro

No longer can you sit in the back of the restaurant and look straight through to the front. My food was delicious, as usual. I ordered a southern charm burger, no cheese & no mayo. My order came with both CHEESE & MAYO. The manager came and brought me a new burger & removed the charge from our bill. I would have preferred to eat with my dinner party but it was fine. I was shocked when my freckled lemonade, which is non-alcoholic, was $4.49. I think I was in an exceptionally good mood lol.

Danielle R.,"Greensboro, NC",46,381,145,4.0,10/13/2012,"I went to Red Robin a few years ago and wasn't impressed with the food and hadn't been back in a while. I decided to go all out tonight and get a 3 course meal. The appetizer was a pick two of onion rings and fried zucchini. The onion rings were yummy and the zucchini, not so much. For my meal, I ordered a burger with onion straws, horseradish mushrooms, provolone, and some sauce and it was so huge I could hardly fit it in my mouth. It came with big fries as a side, and I will say, Red Robin does know its burgers. For dessert, I ordered the Mudpie. Think ice cream cake with chocolate and cookies and cream ice cream, cookie crusts, fudge, and whipped cream. Definitely big enough for two, or two helpings when you don't feel like sharing.

Charlotte H.,"Wilmington, NC",92,197,32,4.0,8/1/2012,"Good chain restaurant. I have always ordered their veggie burger and added guacamole; but you can actually substitute a veggie patty for any burger on their menu. They've recently changed their veggie burger from having the ""regular"" toppings like lettuce and tomato to caramelized onions and grilled zucchini. It was tasty! Their appetizers are well priced and you can get a single order of mozzarella sticks for about $3.

A bus person showed up with a bus tub and removed everything. Very unusual service. The food was delicious. Everyone loved the chili cheese fries.

Amanda K.,"Morrisville, NC",35,74,84,2.0,4/12/2015,"When I first experienced Red Robin it was great. The burgers were big and juicy, and the garlic fries were amazing. Ever since my first visit, overall quality has gone down hill. My husband and I decided to eat here mainly for some bottomless garlic fries. We were seated promptly, but I noticed there were about 3-4 waitresses around the Hostess area. They were all talking and laughing, and it pretty much stayed that way the entire visit. They would go take care of customers, but then come back to their little station to talk. The worst part was that a manager (who I assumed to be the manager was in the middle with them) After we were seated we ordered our drinks and we took a minute to decide. Our waitress was nice enough, but after she took our order and brought our food, we didn't really see much of her. She checked on us once after our food came out but she was almost nonexistent after that. The food itself was just ok. I ordered the mushroom swiss on texas toast with garlic fries. The burger was cooked as I ordered, toast was good, and mushrooms were seasoned with a lot of fresh garlic. However my fries were not good at all. Since when does Red Robin skimp on the fresh garlic for their garlic fries? What I got was fries with sprinkled garlic powder and grated parmesan. The garlic seasoning even tasted off. My husband ordered their new Nacho Crunch Burger with garlic fries as well. His fries were the same, but his burger was incredibly thin (almost to the standards of McDonalds.) We usually save half of our meal for dinner at night, but his burger was so thin it wasn't filling enough and he ate the whole thing. We came for bottomless fries but ended up not getting any. Our waitress finally showed up after we sat not eating/talking for about 5 minutes. We paid and left quickly. It's becoming apparent that Red Robin is cutting corners with their food and is turning into the type of restaurant that wants to get you in and out as quick as possible. There are plenty of other places around Greensboro you can go to for a better burger than here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensboro?start=40

Alex R.,"Greensboro, NC",249,359,155,3.0,11/30/2011,"I'm going to change up the same format because this is a bigger chain then the other places I've rev Let's say this, Red Robin does know burgers. Any combination of flavors you want; they got it. The fact that they can take any burger and make it a wrap is an awesome concept for those that are watching their calories. The never ending thick cut fires with the nice camp fire sauce is nothing short of an addiction.  I will say, however, that I've never had ""great"" service at any Red Robin that I've been in. Decent, good, fair service, yes. But not great.  I do think that the burgers need more seasoning actually on the burger as oppose to just throwing a ton of toppings. Those of us that can tell the difference can tell the difference. :)  The value of the Robin is great. I would pay that much for an epic burger with those fries any day.  At the end of the day it is what it is. A good burger joint.

We ordered the chili chili con queso for an appetizer, which was very tasty. I ordered the prime rib dip sandwich. The bread was great but the prime rib was a little lackluster in the flavor department and was a bit chewy. The onions didn't quite make it to the caramelized stage of cooking. There were definitely other choices on the menu that made me curious and I will most likely be back to try them out.

Ben H.,"Danville, CA",301,360,247,4.0,7/14/2010,"This is one of my favorite burger joints.  I know, I know, it's a chain. But growing up with a Red Robin where all the high school students ate, and then when I was working, my co-workers and I used to try every burger they ever put out. So I was ecstatic when they came to the Triad area.   I have had a bad service experience at this particular location with a floor manager, but that person has since been let go, or left (45 minute wait for food, and the floor manager only said she'd comp the fries and drinks and didn't even put in a new priority order when apparently the original wasn't put in). For the most part, they have fantastic service.   We usually eat a bit earlier here and then hit the movie theater since on the weekends, this area doesn't really have as many things to do so restaurants have entirely ungodly wait times.  The food is fantastic, it's cheap, and you can get it quickly.  You can't beat that at a sit-in place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensboro?start=40
Sue P.,"Greensboro, NC",43,34,2,4.0,6/9/2012,"Red Robin is one of our standards and usually everything is just fine, including tonight. A few too many ""how is everything?"" interruptions, but the food was exactly what we ordered and tasted great. I loved the server's recommendation to try the ciabatta bun - I ate half of it and it was better than a ""plain"" bun. One of our reasons for going there is they offer gluten-free but we were told tonight that a gluten-free bun cost $1 more. I don't recall that from prior trips but perhaps we weren't told.  They're very careful with gluten-free customers and I applaud that. If a person is gluten allergic (I'm not), then a manager has to bring the food to that person. I just prefer gluten-free products but not for $1. Really, that's unnecessary. Again, we like the place. It's always clean, usually fast (not always so at lunch, which is surprising but tonight was great) and accurate and they refill our drinks and fries without our having to ask. They even offer a to-go cup of diet soda if we want one.

Not sure why but we waited another 5 or so minutes before she returned to take our order. 30 minutes later we received our food. The whiskey wrap had way to much ranch dressing, and the French onion soup had so much salt you couldn't eat it. The manager came over and inquired on our food. I told him about the food issues and asked if he had tasted the soup. He offered a different soup which was better and took the wrap off our bill.

Kristi W.,"Kernersville, NC",32,1,,1.0,3/23/2015,"I decided to go to this location on my lunch break, which is a 15min drive from my work. Once I arrived, it took roughly 10min from the time I walked into the restaurant till someone actually took a drink order for me. Once my order was taken the food came out relatively quickly. I sat for at least 5 minutes before the manager came by and brought me silverware (my server had not checked on me). Then once I cut into my burger it was cooked well done and I had ordered it medium well. Now, this ""gourmet"" burger I had was the equivalent of a McDonald's $1 menu burger. It's really no wonder it was overcooked because it was so very thin! I had also asked for the relish to be on the side, which it was left off completely! When my server finally came by to check on me I informed her it was cooked improperly and she offered to have them do it again. By this time I had exactly enough time left to get back to work and so I declined and walked out. I will never ever eat at this restaurant and most certainly never this location again!

I am especially impressed with how helpful the head manager is at this location.  Laura's birthday this last January I knew she and some of her classmates where going to eat there for dinner.  Wishing I could be out there to celebrate with her, I gave the restaurant a call and asked the manager if I could pay for Laura's meal and have it be a surprise to her.  She was delighted to help and it worked out perfectly!  About 90 minutes after I got off the phone I got a call from Laura telling me ""pal!  I can't believe you did that!  I wish I would have ordered booze!"" haha!  So it went off without a hitch.

Lauren P.,"Bailey, CO",123,200,161,3.0,9/20/2010,"Well the food is good, that is if you ever get it and it comes out right. My mom is a fan (like a 5-star fan) of this Red Robin. It's got a convenient location for her and a colleague to meet and have a business lunch. They'll entertain the colleague's kids if he has to bring them. And they have an endless basket of fries. Overall, the place is good. Our server was super nice and helpful (however a teensy bit slow on the drink refills) but she was good. The food however, took FOREVER and my order came out wrong.  We were a party of 4 and perhaps 1/4 of the entire population of the restaurant. When my family hears ""free soda refills"" or ""free french fry refills"" we take advantage of such offers. We sat down, got our drinks, and at least 3-4 times asked each other why the food took so long to get out. Plus - if the fries are endless, why not bring us out a batch while we wait? They should be ready to go on order, right?  So once the food arrived (3 out of 4 orders arrived, somehow a turkey wrap is a lot harder to manage than 3 cheeseburgers), my cheeseburger was missing cheese. Not the end of the world, the veggie black bean burger was delicious and I wasn't complaining. I just didn't want to get charged for cheese when I didn't get any. Well, then we finished our first round of fries and couldn't find the server to request more. My dad, being the self-service sort of guy, went to the exposed kitchen window and asked for some. Due to the wait we had for the fries, it was obvious they had to cook some fresh ones. But I saw two orders come out before our fries did. Both orders had fries! How come our fries weren't ready?! Ugh. So we tried again. More water, soda and fries please. Again, 7-8 minutes for all of it. Sodas & water don't take 7-8 minutes, bring them out first. So that was disappointing...maybe it was a fluke or an off-day but really, first impressions go a long way and while the food was good, it wasn't good enough to make me want to try again. By the way, Red Robin, if you're going to offer ""endless fries"" make sure the kitchen is prepared!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensboro?start=40

Michael R.,"Greensboro, NC",546,161,13,1.0,9/5/2014,"I wish 0 stars was an option. I went to Red Robin at least 1 time per month back in 1991-2 when I lived in California. Over the years it's always been a ""safe"" stop in any city, especially with a young son. A burger and a beer, simple, easy. We decided to try the one in Greensboro about a year back when we moved here. Summary of 3 different visits: Visit 1: Waited 15 minutes to sit in a half-full restaurant. Finally ordered at the bar with my wife and son. Burgers took over 30 minutes to come out-this IS their specialty right? Visit 2: Ordered takeout and the order was completely messed up. Had to run back to get the right food. Visit 3: Restaurant is 1/2 full but there are at least 20 people waiting. We are told it will be 15 minutes. Empty tables with old meals sit everywhere. Finally we are seated after 30 minutes (too tired and late to go elsewhere). They seat us at a partially cleaned table-and finish cleaning. There is a steak bone that sits at the table next to us. We converse and are laughing with the other family sitting next to us. Nothing comes out right; all overcooked. We complain but nothing. Had left a message with corporate. Someone called our home phone but left no message (caller ID).  I hope the District Manager reads this (not the GM) as this is the worst Red Robin I've ever been too-and it's consistently bad.

Marcus W.,"Fletcher, NC",9,98,2,3.0,1/27/2016,"I really enjoyed the Habanero burger I got here. Forget the name but the flavor was amazing. The disappointment was I ordered it MEDIUM. Came out almost well done. Some of my bottomless fries were over cooked slightly (turning white and transparent) So I'm not sure if they are sitting around pre-cooked in a heater. But there was only like 3 tables there, so why would they not cook fries to order? I don't understand honestly. That's just pure laziness.  This place has so much potential. I don't come to Greensboro a lot. But I'd be willing to try it again sometime. But someone mentioned a place called ""big burger"" under me. I might try that next time I'm in town and see how it is, before I gives this place another go. The Red Robin in Florida I went to was just a lot better overall. I mean, where's the passion? If you over cook a burger or fries you start over. It's fast food, it's the easiest menu.  Overall as a company I love them. Lots of unique stuff. I hope it gets better, but I probably wont try it for a few years, again because I'm hardly ever in the area.

Muranda D.,"Greensboro, NC",9,139,,2.0,2/8/2016,"I decided I wanted to try Red Robin, because I saw a commercial on TV for the bottomless fries, and I was like, ""I have to have those!""  I ate very little Saturday morning/afternoon because I was so ready to smash some bottomless fries.  My boyfriend and I got there probably around 5:30, so we were still a little ahead of the dinner rush.  There was a wait, but it wasn't very long- maybe 10 mins.  The lobby was spacious, and the pictures on the walls were entertaining enough to pass the time without watching the clock.  We were seated, and shortly after greeted by our server.  She was friendly enough.  They have little playmakers for you to do trivia on for a charge; we didn't partake in that because we still try to be frugal.  We didn't have an appetizer, again, preparing for the bottomless fries. When we ordered our food, I confirmed with our server that the fries were in fact bottomless (I wanted to make sure she understood why I was there and what was up.) My boyfriend and I each got burgers.  I got the burger with guacamole, bacon and mayo.  It was wonderful.  I like the colour of the beef, it was nicely presented and it tasted amazing.  The first thing I did was pour my fries out of the little metal thing it comes in, into my basket, and placed my fry container on the edge of the table, in my head, what would mean ""I'd like more, please!""  She promptly ran by and grabbed up my fry thing, and kept moving.  I was hoping that was like.. An unspoken understanding.  I realized shortly afterwards it wasn't, so I wasn't upset about that.  I shouldn't make assumptions.  I asked her if she could bring each of us some more, and she said she would.  After that, she seemed very rush to get us out of there, which I understand.  I've severed and bartended and the amount of money you make is usually correlated with how quickly you can turn tables, but we had not been there that long, and I wasn't finished yet.  After she brought us our first refill of fries we were both sitting there without any drinks, and she says, ""Can I get you guys some to go drinks?"" Maybe she legit wanted us to take some with us, but it seemed more so that it was our que to leave.  For our second refill of fries, she only brought us one; my boyfriend didn't get any, even though we asked. Anyways, I was really underwhelmed and a little upset when I left.  I don't think I'll go back, which is sad because the food was good enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensboro?start=20

My problem in the past at all of them across the board is the bottomless fries campaign. It has always been a struggle to get them to bring back more fries without a long wait in between! I will say that this recent visit was quite different, with every request for additional fries being filled in a very reasonable fashion so that we weren't done with our meal and left with just fries! The burgers are indeed good, as well are the chicken sandwiches. They aren't anything to rave about, but not as bad as a meal at Applebee's for sure!

Their reputation has been that of a kid-friendly, family place with all that that entails. Now they are trying to grow their bar business with daily drink and app specials, and are even considering closing in the bar area, thus discouraging some of the kid traffic that flows thru there in the current setup - open at both sides. Pricing on their cocktails and wines is pretty attractive, beer specials as well. The burger is the food item here for most folks, and they are big,and they are not inexpensive - ranging from $8.89 to a little over $10. They are big enough for a lot of folks to split - and all the burgers come with their   Bottomless Steak Fries, which are good in their on right. The Seafood Platter is nice, a little pricey at $13.99 (again, with all the steak fries you can eat), but plenty of food, and very tasty. Great tartar sauce, also. Nachos, onion rings, wings, chili, etc are all good. Other sandwiches, wraps, soups, and salad are available as well. No steak, chops, etc on the menu.

D P.,"High Point, NC",0,1,,1.0,11/5/2016,"We went last night to Red Robin in Greensboro, and they said it would be a 20-25 minute wait, and that was okay. So we waited, after 15 minutes we saw many people leaving, 20 minutes and more people leaving, after 30 minutes goes by even more people have left after they got through with their dinner, but there was only a few people that were let in to be seated.  Now 40-minutes have gone by, so I got up and went to an area where I could view the dinning areas, and about 40% of all the tables and booths were cleaned and empty, so I asked them if they had a shortage of servers for all the tables, and after a few minutes they  finally told me that the kitchen wasn't able to keep up, so they were slowing down letting people in to be seated, and they couldn't tell us how much longer we'd have to wait before being seated. So after waiting 45-minutes, with no information as to how much longer of a wait time there would be, we decided to leave and we found some other place to eat super. This was a Friday night around 7:30, one of their busiest days of the week, and they couldn't keep up with just over 50% of their seated guests. I've been to this same place many times in the past and there was a reasonable small wait time, and never have I experienced anything like what I just experienced last night. I have to assume there's been a change in management. The staff should have inform the people waiting that they were experiencing issues in the kitchen and there waiting times may be a little longer, and let the people decide if they wanted to wait longer or leave, instead of continuing to tell everyone coming in that there is a 25-30 minute wait time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensboro?start=20

I'll start with the good- our waiter was friendly and helpful. Drinks and fry refills were brought to the table quickly.  Now for the bad.  My husband got one of their ""double"" burgers, which come with 2 smaller patties. This turned out to be about the amount of meat on a double burger from Wendy's, but with less flavor. I'm not sure why they ask for a preferred temperature with these burgers, because they will all inevitably come out well done. The fries on both the initial order and the single refill we got were cold. My spicy sombrero salad was more like a sad sombrero salad. The chicken came out burnt on one side- of course, it was the side on the bottom that they tried to hide from me. The salad was missing black beans, cilantro, lime wedge, and bell peppers. After pointing this out, beans and peppers were added but the other toppings were still nowhere to be found. To top it all off, the avocado was brown. I know this place serves enough avocado between burgers and salads that there is no reason it shouldn't be fresh. My son's mini corn dog poppers were ok, but to be fair, that's a really tough item to screw up since you just have to throw it in the fryer. Finally, the floor on the way to the bathroom was so slick, I almost fell down on the way there and back. Oh, and it would be nice if the doors all had functioning locking mechanisms.
