Dana g.,"Monroe Township, NJ",1,36,17,5.0,6/17/2017,Love this place. Service is always great! They are accurate in their wait time and service is always perfect! The menu is plentiful and everything is always fresh. The wait service is always friendly and happy Robbie there. I love that I can get burgers wrapped in lettuce and not worry about all of the carbs. This is one of my favorite burger joints.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamilton?start=20
Ron P.,"Yorktown Heights, NY",53,303,39,4.0,10/10/2015,"I stopped in for lunch while on the road, mostly because I have that ""Red Robin"" tune stuck in my head and there isn't one on my normal track. The place was more or less empty so service was spot on. I picked one of their custom burgers (had 2 in mind and the waitress tipped it towards The Southern Charm). Burger was solid all around and comes with fries.  All in all, it was pretty good but a 14$ burger should be!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamilton?start=20
Lisa C.,"Trenton, NJ",1,5,,4.0,5/24/2017,Three of us went for lunch yesterday. It seemed like it took a little longer than usual for the food to come out.

Frank A.,"Levittown, PA",1,17,,4.0,7/12/2017,Celebrated the wife's birthday with the free birthday burger. Actually she wanted a chicken salad but our server said she had to order a burger.

Kate Z.,"Alexandria, VA",29,77,88,5.0,10/1/2015,"Guys, I've been here a few times and never once had a poor experience. The servers are always attentive and go the extra mile to make sure you leave happy. I always end up telling a manager how great my service and food was here.  I want to give a special shout out to Andrew. My girlfriend and I stopped by for lunch yesterday and decided to split a sandwich. Not only did we receive equal portions of everything we ordered, Andrew even set aside an order of piping hot fries for us to take home and enjoy later!

Fiorella A.,"Elizabeth, NJ",20,9,,2.0,11/29/2016,"I am, or at least I was, a big fan of Red Robin, and I said I was because I just ate there tonight and Im extremely disappointed. I ordered the burning love and my boyfriend ordered the guacamole bacon. Both burgers didnt have any seasoning whatsover!! My burger was extremely spicy and that was all I can taste. The avocado in my bf burger was so plain it wasnt even guacamole. And to top it off, the fries were hard, it was like chewing gum. I used to love eating here but after spending $30 and leaving half of the meal uneaten, I dont think Im coming back.

Fred I.,"East Brunswick, NJ",4,86,14,4.0,2/15/2016,"Went here on New Years Day, with our granddaughter.  Was not optimistic, based on trying one of these off the PA Turnpike near Reading, PA a couple times.  Very busy, but no wait for a booth.  Service was prompt, friendly and thorough. Looking good.  We all ordered burgers and were very happy with the results.  Cooked correctly, large size, good variety of choices.  Juicy, not greasy. Huge soft drinks that precluded the need for refills.  Nice surroundings.   Got enough fries with the original order that endless refills would have been gluttonous.  Overall, really enjoyed it, and want to go back and try some of the other menu items.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamilton?start=20

Terri J.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",3,48,5,5.0,8/18/2016,"I love Red Robin and this location did not disappoint. I went twice during my weeklong visit to the area and brought different folks each time.  It was a hit with everyone, especially those that had never experienced a Red Robins. I had the black n blue burger the first time and the royal red robin the second time.  Fantastic both times.  I'm a picky orderer - I want this but not that, etc.  and they were accommodating each time.  Service was fast and courteous.  Did NOT disappoint!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamilton?start=20

Sean F.,"Richmond, VA",103,241,1526,3.0,5/18/2014,"This place is huge. But even so, the wait can be long at times. For a chain, it's not bad at all. They have over 20 burgers to choose from along with a whole regular menu of other foods. Best of all, their meals come with endless steak fries. Speaking of fries, they have frie seasoning at every table that's pretty damn good! Another plus is that they serve alcohol and the drink menu has a great selection.  I guess my only complaint is that they don't offer a monster burger. So with that said, 3 to 4 starts is the most that I can give any chain. Definitely not bad for the price though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamilton?start=20
Amanda G.,"Crum Lynne, PA",232,583,377,3.0,1/12/2014,"It's a Red Robin...it's the same as every other Red Robin. The location is quite large and our waitress was kind. One part of our order was forgotten but when the error was realized it was brought out quickly to our table. The drink sizes are absurd. They must give you a 26 ounce glass filled with liquid. It was a little ridiculous, but I guess they don't have to bring refills as often. The one thing I will say is that the honey mustard was frightening. It was toxic yellow and had SESAME SEEDS in it. What?? WHY?? So gross.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamilton?start=20
Gwenn C.,"East Windsor, NJ",1,6,11,5.0,7/22/2015,"The service has always been very pleasant. Never an unhappy server. The burgers are always cooked to perfection.

We got seated as soon as we walked in and our server Amber came right up to our table, took our drink orders, got them right away, dropped them off and then didnt come back for 10mins. After returning she took our appetizer and meal order then never stopped by our table until we were almost done with our meal. Luckily another server Joe who was passing by stopped by to check on us and was more than happy to get us what we needed. It wasn't until our server Amber, who seemed to be to busy taking care of the table next to us then to come check on us, saw us tip Joe for being so helpful and attentive that she finally came to ask us if we needed anything. We kindly told her no we're good and that Joe got us everything we needed, but before we could ask for the check she cut us off with a much filled attitude of ""oh great"" and left. She eventually returned with the check and a box.

Dave B.,"Trenton, NJ",23,18,14,3.0,12/23/2017,"It's fast casual dining. My biggest gripe with this place is the prices for their food. $11.50 for chicken strips and fries. That's a lot for a place like this. $2.99 for an iced tea. That's a little high as well. I want to like this place more, but it really seems like their corporate management is trying to squeeze some extra pennies out of folks who, if they dine at RR-type places regularly, probably could use that money elsewhere.  tl;dr: Pricey, average quality food.

Tatiana W.,"Little Falls, NJ",47,76,93,3.0,11/3/2017,"Server was great even though very busy. Had two spots while waiting for the rest of our party. Had the pretzels pieces  with beer cheese dip and the fried pickle nickels with the Ranch dressing for dipping. Both were very good. The pickles although a bit greasy were not overly spiced or salty like most are and were tasty as well. Having filled Up in spots I ordered a soup and salad combo. Had the loaded cream of potato soup -new to menu. It was tasty and plenty loaded with cheddar and bacon pieces but it did taste like a big dollop  of sour cream was stirred in. It could have been hotter for my taste.  The salad was the house salad with lettuce, chopped tomato, cucumber, shredded cheese and carrots. It was fresh and crisp and the blue cheese dressing was adequate.  One complaint, being near the kitchen with a straight on view into the kitchen -it was very messy. The floor was very wet, I do not know how any employees didn't skip and fall! There were paper sheets that may have come from between burgers all over the floor because the garbage container was overfilled. This garbage can was right up against what looked like a food keeper. Yuck. Over an hour and nothing cleaned up. The bathroom not too clean either! Clean up it up Red Robin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamilton
Feny S.,"Princeton Junction, NJ",80,90,311,2.0,6/17/2017,"Mmmm .... didn't quite hit the spot for me.  I've been craving for a ""big, fat, juicy, melt in your mouth"" burger lately. Walked in to this join with that expectation. I thought ""hey it's a BURGER place! At least they must have decent burger"" Wrong! I've been to Red Robin's other locations and it wasn't bad.  So that day I ordered the smoke and pepper burger.  It didn't enjoy it. The burger was dry.  The plate had grease mark and finger prints all over it.  The fries came in half full that it looked like a left over from the other table.  Yes the offer bottomless steak fries if we want more but that's not the point.  Prices are a little high too. I was going to give this join one-star.  But then I remembered how the waiter called me ""Miss"" (not ""Mam""!!) ... for that, I added another star, to two-stars!  Lols ...

Rebecca C.,"Clifton, NJ",25,65,77,3.0,11/28/2017,The burgers are great as well as the tower of onion rings with ranch dressing. Service is a disaster.

I know this is just a burger place but some days the burgers are cooked well with fresh ingredients and sometimes its like getting a fancy burger king. The appetizers are good our favorite is the mozzarella sticks when these are hot truly best around.  I will agree the menu can be a bit  pricey but its more of a sit down place so you aren't getting for less anywhere else.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamilton

The burgers though were disappointing to say the least.  I don't understand how a restaurant that prides themselves on burgers aren't pumping out patties consistently at a high rate.  When we wanted a refill on our ""bottomless"" fries it took 15 minutes before I grabbed my server and told him I just wanted to check and to forget about the fries. Only went there because I had a gift card and certainly won't go back. Five guys could teach them a thing or two.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamilton

April H.,"Warrington, PA",33,112,580,3.0,10/11/2016,"Perfect for an inexpensive meal. Typical chain restaurant food. I would stick with burgers and sandwiches. They offer bottomless fries (steak or sweet potato) which is a nice perk if you are really hungry.  Recently, I had the grilled romaine salad with chicken for lunch and I liked it well enough (although it had too much dressing). I also tried the chicken and waffles sandwich, which was tasty. My husband had the black and blue burger and liked it.  The service is consistently good. The bar drinks are a little slow to come out especially when ordering a second mid meal, and it arrives when you've just about finished eating.

They have the option to make any burger entree a vegan boca burger or a garden vegetarian burger which is great with no extra charge. All burgers come with bottomless fries.

Gerald S.,"Newtown, PA",1012,2191,6425,4.0,2/6/2016,"I was completely unaware of the existence of the Hamilton Marketplace uber-commercial zone until I returned to work in the area last year. Slowly, I have begun to visit the many restaurants there. Red Robin Gourmet Burgers is one of the offerings.   I stopped in for a late lunch last week when I had an urge for a good slider, but something better than the fast food variety, less greasy than Five Guys, and priced for most of us (sorry, Smashburger). Red Robin was bright and airy, with glass walls, high ceilings, and effective lighting.  As I approached, the front door was opened for me by a greeter who welcomed me and pointed toward the angled bar when I asked if I could sit there for lunch.   The bartender approached easily, asking if I wanted a drink and menu.  Indeed, I did.  The All American Patty Melt (medium) and Ice Tea would do me, thank you.  My meal arrived within 10 minutes on a large platter that held the Grilled Marble Rye Sandwich, the aluminum collar holding vertical French Fries, and a small container of dipping sauce.  After lifting the top lid and squirting ketchup over the Sautéed Onion and Pepper Jack Cheese that covered the beef, I lifted the first half of the triangle for a bite.  It was very good. Accurately medium finish; never frozen patty that held its shape throughout; softly translucent sweet onion and mildly spicy cheese.  Do so love a properly created patty melt!  But, it was a bit leaky with so much pressed within its rigid borders, that I resorted to fork and knife to devour the rest of it.   All the while, good rock & roll played a mix of songs I like, the HDTVs broadcast sports and news without sound, and the customer at the stool to my right kept the bartender occupied with a string of commentary about various innocuous topics.  I was happily alone with my tasty lunch.   With soft drink, the meal came in at just under $15, with tip.  Quite a deal for the enjoyment of good burger, attractive surroundings, and a little peace and solitude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamilton
Pea K.,"Trenton, NJ",0,71,145,4.0,8/7/2016,"Haven't been here in a while. The bar staff were really great and made us feel welcomed. For appies, lightly breaded broccoli heads and spinach and artichoke dip which came with chips and celery. We had the Mad Love Burger with two kinds of cheeses (Parmesan and mozzarella), bacon, avocado, onions, and tomatoes, with garlic and Parmesan cheese fries - they had me at cheese.

The not so good?   Well, the restrooms were not clean at all.  The service was hit-miss.   Our food came reasonably quickly, but we missed out on the ""bottomless"" fries.   Our waiter never returned to our table after our food was dropped off until we asked for our check.   So there was a full 20-30 minutes where no one asked or offered the bottomless fries refill.   Sure we could have randomly stopped someone else who worked there, but it would have been nice if our waiter had checked in on us at least every once in a while.  And no, the waiter wasn't spread thin  just didn't bother to stop by.   There also weren't that many tables seated at the time so stopping by just wasn't a priority.

In the crowded burger scene, Red Robin is head and shoulders above the rest. Service is always good, with friendly and attentive staff. Food is always cooked exactly as ordered and tasty. Sure its a chain, but it's one off the best chains in my opinion. Tried just about every one of their burgers over the years; Prime Chophouse is the best of them all.

Cheeburger's theme and harsh lighting are not my favorite, Bobby's Burger Palace feels slightly overpriced, I don't love the fries at 30 Burgers... I'm sure there are others around here that I've tried, but that's the peer group I'm going for here. I always leave a little fuller than I feel like I should allow myself to be, and I usually steer clear of chains, but so it goes. If I'm in a steak fry mood, this is my go-to.

I ordered some kind of Guinness milkshake and my friend had the Blue Moon one and both were amazing.  My only complaint is that my burger was way too overcooked to be considered medium rare.

Sometimes overcooked but more hit than miss. I do like the condiment options for the fries including buzzard sauce and tasty ranch. The gingerbread shake that is served during the winter holiday is fantastic. It seems that when it is very crowd the kitchen staff preparing the food gets very overwhelmed and you could be waiting for a long time. Less crowded brings a better experience.

Morton F.,"New Castle, DE",83,922,3709,4.0,9/4/2013,"I think I say this about pretty much every Red Robin location. Their burgers are expensive for what you get. Creative? Maybe. Unique? Perhaps.

Cindy L.,"Trenton, NJ",1,13,10,2.0,1/2/2016,I went here on Friday with a party of 6. The hamburgers are half the normal size at this particular red robins. No I'm not joking. For me it was enough but not for a man expecting a red robin hamburger. The food tastes great however the fries and root beer floats ( with purchase ) are endless if your waiter/waitress isn't busy running back and forth to several other tables. It seemed as if they had one to many hostesses standing around the front and not enough waitress/waiters to cover tables. I went to use the restroom on our way out and a little girl was on the john complaining to a family member that she had an upset stomach after eating her meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamilton?start=40

Freyjah S.,"Glassboro, NJ",0,3,,2.0,10/5/2012,"The Pros: Lot's of hamburger choices with various toppings and hamburger buns, endless french fry options, no charge for replacing fries with a healthier alternative such as a salad. The Cons: Your waitress will leave and other waitresses will bring your food/ wait on you only for your original waitress to re-appear at the end asking for a tip. Loud children everywhere, can't hear yourself talk.  Overall: Disappointing experience overall. My first time at Red Robin and it will probably be the last. Within a one hour span I've never heard a ""birthday chant"" repeated so many times in my life...This restaurant seems to cater exclusively to families with kids. The restaurant was noisy both from the kids and the people cooking the food (me and my mother were seated at a table located right next to the kitchen. The cook had to scream in order to be heard over the overall ""loudness"" of the restaurant itself.)   Recommendations: Go to this restaurant if you want a big hamburger with endless french fries! Otherwise, stay far far away. This is not a good date spot nor is it a quite place to enjoy a meal and chat with friends. I highly recommend just doing their take-out option.

Eddie L.,"New Egypt, NJ",129,179,58,2.0,1/5/2010,"Stopped in here with Melissa Leigh and Joey the other night. I've been here several times and it's usually pretty good. Unfortunately this last time was by far the worst. We were seated immediately and our waitress asked us for our order a minute later. We said give us a minute and then we waited, and waited and waited some more. Finally the manager saw us looking desperate and sent our server over. Somebody else brought out our soups and salads and somebody else brought us our meals.  I had the New England Clam Chowder, a dish upon which I'm a world renowned expert and the Chowder here is GREAT! Each and every time I have it. The place is allegedly famous for its burgers, and I've had em before and they are good. I had the Fish and Chips this night for a change of pace but regretted it when it came. The fish was downright greasy and the chips were merely the same fries everybody else gets with their burgers. Extremely disappointing. I figured if they got the Chowder so right the same might be true for the other seafood dishes, but I sure was wrong.  I've eaten here with Debbi Faye and we like to sit at the very small bar, maybe 8 or 10 seats because the place is often, as it was this last time, over run with little, screaming, ill behaved, bratty kids. Not sure what it is with this place as I can't think of any other place I've been to like that. Must be something in the local water.  After we got our food this last time we never saw our waitress again until we were ready to leave, and i was really in the mood for a second brewskie. It took another eternity to get our check and the place was not crowded. To be honest, the service has always been fine before here so maybe we caught our server on a bad night or maybe she just sucks as a waitress.
