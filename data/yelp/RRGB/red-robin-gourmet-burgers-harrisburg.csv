The last time I was there I ordered French Onion soup and sent it back twice, the first 2 times it was only marginally warm.  Even the 3rd time it was only slightly warmer.  I guess they just can't serve hot soup.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-harrisburg?start=20

Brooke C.,"Santa Clara, CA",1,1,,1.0,3/30/2017,"I just called in and spoke with the hostess to ask for them to sing to my Dad for his birthday. I am 3,000 miles away and would have loved to be there, but since I'm not I thought he would enjoy being surprised with some singing and dessert. To my surprise.....no one ever sang or acknowledged his birthday. I know his server was Kat, which I told the hostess. I'm not sure if it was a miscommunication or not but it was upsetting especially being in the hospitality industry myself, I love to create memorable moments for all of my guests.......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-harrisburg?start=20

Christopher C.,"Conshohocken, PA",168,1318,6419,3.0,7/19/2014,"A place like RR truly defines a solid but never overwhelming three star experience. The kids meals are a decent value as the entrees are of a good size and they have a decent array of healthier sides with fruits & vegetables instead of most chain places that only offer fries or look at you like you're nuts if you ask about subbing out said fried items. The adult entrees were a Banzai Burger and a Turkey Burger.  The Turkey Burger was cooked alright but they added way too much of the spicy sauce to it so that each bite turned into a slop fest.  The lovely wife proclaimed her Banzai acceptable although it was almost a bit too pink for her tastes/what she asked for. The infamous bottomless fries now matter more than ever since RR started practicing portion control by putting your first round of fries in that stupid metal cup.  I suppose it's a great idea for their bottom line but it's annoying no doubt to the service staff/the paying customers when only eight fries show up with your burger so you know right away that you likely are going to be asking/waiting for more. As for the service, nothing extraordinary as it was after the lunch rush and even though our server had quite a few tables to look after she more or less kept up with clearing plates & drink refills. On a ranting sidebar, the Ziosk is still the most stupid & annoying thing to ever enter the world of chain dining.  We're not one of those modern mutant families that must be entertained/titillated at all times so  the rare times we visit a RR the first thing to get removed from the table and put either on the window sill or the floor is the Ziosk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-harrisburg?start=20

The server was top drawer, but told us jokes, and there were plenty of jokes on our plates and table.  The server would put down plates noting that 'be careful!  this is very hot!'.  This is normally slightly funny because usually they are not very hot -- in this case, given that the food came out quite late, it probably was true at one point.  But, when she said that for a plastic basket, we were LOL, rolling in the aisles (once she left).  The all you can drink rootbeer floats were tall, but skinny.  tall means that the are big (skinny means that if you are an adult and past that Piagetian stage, you know better).   The bottomless fries were literally bottomless, they came in a small ring (that is, no bottom!, haha, lol).  The burgers are meh, and I am not so keen on burgers to start with. the wrap next to me was meh, the water with lemon was good, though.  the burger across from me was meh.  the nachos were meh, the buffalo chicken boneless, that might be worth trying again.   The ordering kiosk offers games, but you have to pay (but only after you order your drinks, AND the drinks are entered, AND you can't order water (wags finger)).  And, there were not enough to go around, batteries not charged you know.  And, a button to call the waitress, but she can't see it, I'm told.  HaHa!

B T.,"Harrisburg, PA",3,59,2,2.0,11/26/2015,"I was so excited to eat here because I LOVE a good burger. So a place that says they have the best, specialize in it, and whose menu is filled with different kinds and options should be able to nail a good burger, right? Let's talk temperature. Any ""burger joint"" should have this down to a science. But I ordered a medium rare burger and it came out beyond well done. The bread was really soggy, the fixings not fresh at all, and I opted for the broccoli instead of fries and almost threw up when I ate one piece. It was that bad, and really overcooked. I didn't send it back because I at least try to be a really easy customer. I just wanted to pay, give my excellent server Ian a good tip, and get out of there. My fellow diners had similar terrible food, but I'll leave it to them to review it. The good thing, if there was one, was the bottomless drinks outside of fountain drinks. The lemonade, etc., was all good. But, they put a TON of ice in it and it took forever to get a refill. I resorted to just drinking their water, which was disgusting because it was unfiltered and had a nasty taste. I thought most restaurants these days have industrial water filters, especially if the city water is nasty. If it was all super cheap I could probably forgive it. But for a comparable price you can get a great artisan burger cooked to perfection at any decent restaurant. Really a shame...and a ripoff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-harrisburg?start=20

I've never been disappointed going to Red Robin and this last dining trip was no different. Exceptional dining experience. Although, Emmey wasn't very fond of our waitress. She was a kind young lady but too often ran her gossiping mouth with employees (where the customers could hear). Emmey didn't care much about the gossip if her salad and drink were getting refilled.

Mike M.,"Lewistown, PA",91,224,318,2.0,5/3/2014,"I enjoy burger joints. so with that, I decided to try Red Robin with the family. I probably should have just cooked on the grill. It wasn't all bad, at least.  Without really getting into a full fledged and detailed review,  I will just give it something simple as I really don't want to waste much time on this one.  The problem with this page isn't with the servers. They were great. they earned this page two stars.  The food didn't.  Honestly, I was a little shocked at the bill after the subpar food. The French Dip was nearly flavorless and the onions were soggy. The cole slaw was also nearly tasteless. My family all got burgers. They complain about the mediocre taste. The fries were standard steak fries. They were decent. But not overly impressive.  So when in the Colonial Park area and you are itching for a burger, maybe try 5 guys. Around $65 bill for two kids meals, two burgers, a French Dip, sodas and a beer. Oh, and really tasteless pretzel bites. That was before tip.

Danielle K.,"Washington, DC",80,84,4,3.0,4/8/2014,"When I'm in a place that's not  a bastion of veg-friendliness, it's nice to know there are chains that can accommodate me.  Red Robin can substitute a Gardenburger (vegetarian) or Boca Vegan Burger on any burger item on the menu for no extra charge.  Just ask them to cook it on a separate part of the grill.  I don't go fancy--just a veggie burger with lettuce, tomato, onions, ketchup, and mustard; plus a side of fries is fine by me.  That they are endless fries is nice, but I've never needed to take advantage of that. So the food is decent and filling. The service depends on time of day and how full the restaurant is.  On our most recent visit, they got hit with a large group, and in spite of it being late and not otherwise crowded, the service at our table suffered a bit.  But it happens.  I know from experience that large groups are difficult.

Now I know it was a Friday night but it was 9 pm place is open till midnight wasn't packed but yet seemed like most of the staff was already wiped out for the evening! I ordered a Yuengling Lager and I have to tell you if I was Dick Yuengling I would have been ticked because it wasn't all that cold not sure if their tap system was low on the CO2 or the coils not iced or if the fave me a mug straight out of the dishwasher but I am definitely not used to warm Yuengling! Well the 1 Star  is for the Second order of fries of their bottomless fries they came out hot crispy and delicious!

Joseph S.,"Catonsville, MD",358,44,74,1.0,10/14/2017,"I am writing this for catharsis. My recent visit to the Red Robin in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania was a complete disaster. I get emails every week from Red Robin for their BOGO burger specials. I am away from home during the week so I decided to invite the friend that I am staying with to get dinner with me at Red Robin. 1. We order. Food comes out. Everything is fine. We ask for drink refills when our food is brought to the table. 2. The waitress sets my drink on the table, and then proceeds to spill my friend's large Coke all over him, all over his food, and all over his phone. We scramble to dry off his phone. 3 other staff members come over to help clean up the mess. We are moved to another table. The phone seems to be fine. However, my friend's dinner was ruined because the bun soaked up the coke. The staff tells us that he'll get another burger pronto. Everyone makes mistakes, so we are fine at this point. Coke-soaked and wet, but fine. 3. We wait another 15-20 minutes. Don't see the waitress, and then she finally comes over to the table and asks us if we need anything else. I ask when they are going to bring my friend's burger. She gets annoyed and asked why he would get another burger. I said, as nicely as possible, because the first burger was ruined. She storms off to the kitchen. This young lady just dumped a large coke all over my friend and now she has an attitude about the situation. 4. Manager brings over the burger after another 10-15 minutes. 5. Try to pay the bill, but since we were moved to another table there is no computer pay station at the new table. I don't see our waitress at this time so I get someone else to help. They bring a computer pay station to us. But there is no bill on the pay station. 6. I then click the CALL WAITRESS button. The waitress comes over and puts the bill on the pay station which takes about another 10 minutes. But it isn't at the special price, it's at full price. She says that she can't help us with that. At this point I am in disbelief and I lose it. I go and find a manager. I explain what has been going on, and the manager then tells me that the food is on the house because of the situation. What a mess. Red Robin, get it together? I know that working in food service is not a fun job. But you can't hire young kids to wait on tables that are going to give people a terrible attitude AFTER dumping drinks all over the customers. OMG get it together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-harrisburg
John B.,"Lebanon, PA",13,13,1,1.0,8/30/2017,"Ordered their $14 ""finest"" madlove burger. Smaller than expected for a $14 burger. The citrus-marinated tomatoes and onions consisted of two of the worlds smallest tomatoes and one little red onion circle. The shredded Romaine lettuce was old and slimy. The jalapeño relish was almost nonexistent, perhaps they were trying to save money by putting only a teaspoon on?  The candied bacon was missing and when I asked our server she seemed irritated. She brought me regular bacon. I asked about the candied bacon and she said it doesn't come with candied bacon. I shouldn't have to inform the staff what ingredients come on the food they serve, but she did bring me candied bacon then. Overall, the burger was gross and certainly wasn't worth $14.  One of the kids ordered the pasta with a side of fries and they brought a side of tangerines or oranges or whatever the hell they were. Won't be eating at a Red Robin robin again.

I guess they're trying that burger and beer ""pub"" feel.  Not really working.  Its still a family restaurant to me.  They do have a great rewards program that's all digital now.  You simply put your phone number into the tablet on the table and it will calculate your transactions.  I've often been surprised with a free burger upon check out.  What I don't like are the fact that the prices went up.  Plus their alcohol prices are insane.  And not in a good way.  You could get a domestic draft and pay about $7.  Its a chain in PA why $7 for a miller lite?  Oh well.  Also the place is not always very clean which takes away from their burger bar feel and back down to the kid friendly family place.  The bathrooms are ALWAYS dirty.  Everytime my daughter tells me she has to go I cringe.  I've  never been to a place that has had a bathroom as consistently dirty as this Red Robin.   Anyway I'll return when I have a free burger or I am getting a craving for their fries.  But I am disappointed at the decline in cleanliness and consistency.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-harrisburg
Dayna R.,"Harrisburg, PA",189,369,55,3.0,8/14/2017,"A for taste, C for service. Upon arrival the hostess was extra frazzled and kept referring to my boyfriend and I as ""these people,"" which although unintentional, was super off-putting. We finally arrived to our seat which was next to a huge table of dirty dishes and mess, which was strange, because it did not seem like they were too busy on a Thursday evening. While leafing through my menu, there was some food on the pages and sticky spots, but I tried to ignore it. Having recently given up meat (who knows how long this will last...) I decided to get the Garden Burger and a side of ranch. I requested that we receive our fries ahead of our meal, as all locations typically accommodate. The fries took around 10-15 minutes to receive, sans sauce. Then, it took until my meal come to finally be able to get my sauce, as my server was nowhere to be found to request my dipping sauce for my fries. My meal, which by the way, I watched sit under a heat lamp for about 10 minutes before someone finally took notice and brought it to my table. When my burger arrived, my boyfriend's burger had items on it that he had requested not be on his burger, luckily I eat pickles, so I got those. However, my burger was practically falling apart. Luckily, it tasted delicious, but I may as well just ordered a burger salad, because this was not a handheld meal, but rather one that required extra effort to keep it all from falling out of the bun.

So I said why don't you go get a list of the gyms you have and come back to me and tell me what you have. 10 minutes later she finally comes back with a few genes that they have. I order my Jen and at this point my husband has still not got his beer that he ordered. Three or four minutes later go by and we finally get our drinks and our appetizers. The cheese for my pretzel bites was cold. When the burgers came out the quality to me seems mediocre. Unfortunately I don't think we'll be back. To top it all off my husband got their special fries.

Harrison F.,"Waynesboro, PA",54,49,31,3.0,3/17/2017,"Red Robin's claim to fame is the wide variety of burger options plus bottomless steak fries but this restaurant fell short of the mark. The food was satisfactory and likely worthy of 4 stars; however, the poor service caused it to drop a star.  A group of 4 of us stopped in for a late lunch and after a short wait were taken to our table. Walking through the seating area is a little tricky. I understand the desire to pack as many tables as possible into the building but when there isn't room for me to slip past some of the larger customers it may be time to redesign the layout.  Our waitress quickly took our food and drink orders but then disappeared until bringing our meals. I asked for mustard but she forgot about me and didn't bring it until my last bite of burger.  The food is decent when it comes to burgers but in my opinion the menu needs simplified. Too many options and choices especially when they push the idea of ""build your own burger""... why even have such an option if every burger imaginable is already on the menu. The fries are great but don't buy into the idea of bottomless. The second serving is smaller and after being brought to the table the waitresses seem to disappear - mostly bc you use the kiosk on the table to pay your bill so they have no reason to come back around.  Food is worth coming back for again and hopefully service will be improved.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-harrisburg

Kimberly A.,"Harrisburg, PA",61,9,,2.0,6/20/2013,"Came in here for a lunch break with a friend.  My main complaint about the restaurant is the new ""ziosk"" feature.  It's basically an iPad on the table where you order your drinks, requests for refills, order your appetizers, and pay on the Ziosk.  My friend and I haven't been there for some time, and when our server seated us, she quickly explained what the ziosk was and zoomed away.  We figured our server would come by and re explain the machine or at least get our drink order (since she only had one other table), but she didn't come by for a good 15 minutes until we had to flag her down.   When we ordered our drinks and apps, she just put them on the Ziosk and walked away.  A different server came out with our orders, and when we paid on the Ziosk after our meal it automatically suggested we tip 20%. 20%. Really? You want me to pay 20% on what basically was an experience I could have had from just going to Sonic? Needless to say, I readjusted the tip to what I saw fit and we both left unsatisfied.  The Ziosk would be convient...if you are not expecting to be served.  To be honest, what's the point of having servers?  The stupid thing was also taking up obnoxious amount of space on our small 2 person table.

Whenever I've gotten burgers there the rolls have been stale and so dry they crumble apart.  The burger I had today would have been good if not for the stale roll and the unfresh lettuce. That's the other thing- their shredded lettuce always tastes like old lettuce that was soaked in that chemical they use to refresh produce that's on the verge of 'going over' .  It's unfortunate really.

Jim K.,"Harrisburg, PA",10,12,,1.0,1/23/2010,"Even the balloon was a flop! Red Robin has been a dependable performer for our family for several years and we expected much the same for our recent dinner. Unfortunately, the fact that my 9 year old's helium balloon sank when we brought it from the lobby to our table was an omen of things to come. We waited nearly 15 minutes before I was finally able to make eye contact with a server, any server to take our order. It was to be burgers for the parents and fish and chips for the kiddo, with an order of onion rings as a starter.  One of the (dis)advantages of an open kitchen is that patrons can spy upon when orders arrive at the pass. I was able to watch the sad story of our ""towering onion rings"" as they sat tall and proud on the shelf for several minutes until some other server noted that they looked lonely and cold. She then proceeded to pull them off of their tower, place them in a basket and stick them under a warming lamp for several minutes. Finally our server reappeared (from where we don't know), to then reassemble the ring tower and bring it out. Predictably, the rings were cold and greasy. I instructed the server that we wanted fresh rings and wanted them before our meal arrived. Sure enough, the meal arrived before the appetizer, so when the 2nd batch came out a few minutes after the meal, we sent them back as they were no longer relevant, and perhaps to help this poor server understand that when people ask for an appetizer to arrive first, that she must do more than simply be passive and hope that the kitchen staff can read her mind. The meal itself was underwhelming. Each entree was missing components. The bleu cheese burger had no bleu cheese, another burger was missing a topping as well as missing aside order, and a request for honey mustard dipping sauce was apparently ignored. Then after asking for it a 2nd and a 3rd time, we were given a poppy mustard salad dressing and then a dijon dressing by an apologetic manager who explained that they do not have honey mustard (curious that our server didn't tell us this when we ordered it with the meal). I am usually quite tolerant when I go out to eat, but the lackadaisical approach of both the service staff and management at this place was really quite galling. A table next to us (also with child) was waiting for their meal when we arrived and was still waiting when we got served, despite repeated calls for the server and then several managers to remedy the problem. They ultimately left after their order finally arrived and it was the wrong food.  Our server would disappear for 10 to 15 minute blocks of time. All in all, bland food, rotten service, and even a helium balloon that couldn't float.
