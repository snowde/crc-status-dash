Karen C.,"San Jose, CA",163,507,424,3.0,1/8/2018,"My mom and I were shopping at the mall and decided to have lunch here.  They were quite busy so we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table.  Not bad at all. Our waitress came by pretty quickly and said she would be right back.  She came back shortly and took our orders.  She was a bit slow explaining the check process with their on-table machines.  So we did end up checking out through the machine but it was out of paper so we never got our receipt. I started with the fried pickles.  They come with a spicy sauce but the waitress asked if I wanted ranch for them.  I said yes but when they came they had the spicy sauce.  Later though she brought me ranch. I had the Banzai burger in a lettuce wrap.  This is a tasty burger with pineapple and lots of cheese.  A bit hard to eat in the lettuce so you end up knife and forking it but its still good.  And I love their fries.  The serving of fries was a bit smaller than normal but I think they are unlimited so we could have asked for more. Mom had the Southern Charm burger.  She had asked for no produce but still wanted the grilled onions, bacon and cheese.  Well they messed it up and brought tomato and no onions.  Mom ate it anyway and said it was okay. So a bit a miss on a few things but overall not bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2
David M.,"Las Vegas, NV",62,25,14,1.0,12/22/2017,"I love Red Robin. It's always a top 5 restaurant when my wife and I are deciding on where to eat. This particular location is the worst I've been to.  The floors are sticky. The hostesses were unhelpful and dismissive. The bathrooms look like they havent been visited by a cleaner in hours. Our server didn't introduce himself and got right into ""are you guys ready to order?"" Followed immediately by ""hold on I'll be right back. I forgot my pen"".  All of this still isn't a dealbreak for me because of how much I love the food.  The way the kitchen looked when I left the bathroom is another story. The photo I posted speaks for itself. This place is filthy. I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2
Brad D.,"Las Vegas, NV",24,103,10,3.0,12/6/2017,Standard burger fare. I get a salad as I don't find their fries good enough to warrant an endless option.

Alex B.,"Henderson, NV",3,4,16,1.0,1/14/2018,"I am a regular at this place but I wonder why I insist to come back. I always ask for a specific table and always tell them I don't like booth because is too tight for my big body. They continuously ignore me and take me to a booth. Today, after been taken to a booth again I reminded her the table requested. She took us there but a family was just given the table.

Lauren C.,"Henderson, NV",284,984,2581,3.0,8/13/2017,"Every once in awhile I let my husband choose where to eat and chains are his jam. This chain makes for an okay meal option. The restaurant was packed for lunch on Saturday so we sat in the bar area which didn't have a wait. The service was good with multiple servers checking on us and making sure we had everything we needed. The food did take a little longer to arrive than I expected, but they were busy. My husband really enjoyed his burger. I enjoyed that I could substitute grilled chicken in one of the burger options. Since it is a chain it's so easy to Google the menu options and quickly get calorie counts. This made is much easier to make a somewhat smart choice for lunch. The food isn't too bad, service is good, and it's an economical choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2
David P.,"Las Vegas, NV",25,133,1965,3.0,1/29/2017,Located adjacent to the entrance of the mall. Generally good vibe. Always a din of sound due to the high traffic of people that frequent this establishment.  Adequate seating for dining or for sitting at the bar. The TVs could be a little bigger. But the full bar makes up for that :-) Always a good selection of unique burger combinations. Bottomless fries are a plus. But be sure to get the garlic fries. They are the best! The servers were very professional and pleasant to work with. Mid range prices for mid-range burgers. Overall very good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2
Jared N.,"Henderson, NV",269,546,370,3.0,5/27/2017,"I like Red Robin in general. They have some interesting burger options aside from the standard. I especially like their mushroom burger as it is garlic heavy and loaded with mushrooms. But I always try to get something different when I come in. Usually I get a burger but I have tried a chicken sandwich as well. One thing sticks out in my mind at this location in particular. The food doesn't seem as fresh as it should. The fries are thin and over cooked for being steak fries. And the bun, whether on a burger or a chicken sandwich, always seems to be dried out. Dried to the point of breaking and crumbling. Almost stale you could say. The over all taste of the sandwich is alright but having a disappointing bun just leaves me feeling less than satisfied. I've not noticed this at other Red Robin locations. Mostly just this one.  I will say the service I recieve once I am seated is usually pretty good. I am typically shown to the bar section to sit either at the bar or a high table. Being a single diner I suppose is the reason for that. But the person behind the bar, despite always being busy, is rather attentive. My order is taken right away and typically comes out quickly. Hard to complain about that. I don't always end my meal with dessert but when I do, Red Robin has me covered. They have some cool alocholic desserts. Just the other night I had a root brewskie float. Alcoholic root beer poured over vanilla soft serve. I've also tried their Guiness beer shake. Any of their adult geared desserts are a fun departure from chocolate cake and ice cream. Why not end on a happy note.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2
Erica C.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,9,26,5.0,10/21/2017,This location gets pretty busy as it is located inside of the Galleria Mall. They've done some remodeling and it looks very modern and nice.

The waitress was terrible, we had to ask anther waiter for utensils after our meal arrived. We ordered our food before 2 other tables and got our food last. The food came out incorrectly. We asked for a manager and when she arrived she did not tell us she was a manager she asked if we wanted refills on our waters.

Crystal M.,"Las Vegas, NV",168,268,14,4.0,3/5/2017,"Love their menu options...everything is always good.  I really enjoy the garden burger option & low-carb lettuce wrapping option.

Shelby V.,"Grandville, MI",13,31,2,1.0,11/11/2017,"I have not been to a Red Robin since 2010 so I don't know if it's a decline in food quality or the fact that I was in high school and had no taste at the point but we visited the other day and it was meh. The server was decent and we noticed that three tables in 5 minutes were getting something comped from their bill. We weren't sure if this was the server or the restaurant but we should have paid more attention. My chicken sandwich was average, but not worth the 10.00 and my boyfriend was the least satisfied. He asked for the bottomless root beer float but instead of rootbeer he'd like coke. The server brought the rootbeer float AND a glass of coke, even after explaining, again what he wanted, no fix. Then his burger came out and he took two bites and wanted to leave. Thank god we can pay by card at our seat or we would have waited ten minutes to flag someone down. Next time I know to save the 40.00 and go elsewhere. Oh and he asked for fresh jalapeños on his burger as that was an option and got deep fried instead. He said it was all mush and that also killed the burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2
Deon D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,68,836,5.0,8/17/2017,"I can honestly say that this is the best overall burger joint and casual dining restaurant in Las Vegas or even the country. Why? Three big reasons: One, the offerings will fill you up unlike some restaurants that still leaves you hungry again within 2 hours. Two, the rewards program that not only you can earn points to get the free burger but also automatically get the free burger on your birthday. Three, is the endless French fries or potato wedges. You can order chicken and veggie burgers also. Just the point you can get the best burger with endless fries if this restaurant was around when I was a kid, I be like what's a McDonald.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2
Biruk S.,"Henderson, NV",0,2,,5.0,11/13/2017,"I went to Reb Robin on Friday (Veterans Day observed) and say they had the ""Table Set for One"" on display for customers to observe. I thought that was very heartwarming given the Holiday and I love how they included that touch to honor Veterans. On top of that the service the waitress provided was exceptional. Unfortunately I cannot remember her name but she was the nicest lady who did her best to ensure we felt comfortable and had everything we needed. When the food came it was exactly how we ordered and fresh off the grill. Amazing service, great food, and they honored our veterans.. what more can you ask for?

Richard R.,"St. Joseph, MI",0,5,,4.0,12/22/2017,"I like their burgers and fries. My complaint was about the cleanliness at the Galleria-Henderson location. I noticed really bad greasy finger prints all over the glass divider where I was sitting. It was disgusting and I'm a guy. You need to look through this glass to see outside. I mentioned this to the waitress but received no real response. I later emailed corporate with my complaint with the location. I received a response a few days later saying that they have notified the manager of the location. Problem was they had the wrong location listed, not even the right city. If you can't respond correctly don't respond at all. Obviously they don't much care.

Tanya B.,"Henderson, NV",1,16,13,1.0,3/13/2017,"Please, please do not dine here.  Service is soo slow.  I was with a party of 5 people. It took 10 min for the server to order drinks. 25 min for an appetizer and 40 minutes to get to the main entree. We didn't bother with desert.  Food was so disappointing. Sorry I didn't take photos of the food. I had the BLTA turkey croissant sandwich. Bread was dry, 1 thin piece of turkey and the texture of the bacon seemed like it was microwaved. Did I forget to mention the amount of mayonnaise that was put on both sides of the bread?! No exaggeration, about a 1/4 cup!  I had a side of broccoli that was flimsy  over-cooked and slightly browned. I had a side of fruit that was browned and dry.  Seemed like my food came from a run down gas station deli. My refill glass of strawberry lemonade had previously dried strawberry seeds on the rim! The manager was called over. We explained our experience. He came to our table dragging his feet. He didn't care to hear a word and was quick to say we will deduct the meals and sides from the bill. By the way, the manager admitted to the broccoli being microwaved. I'm not going to mention the disaster of the other entrees.  Just terrible. I will not recommend or dine at this Red Robin again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2

Not to mention I told the hostess Mallory that it was my birthday and mentioned it to the server. No birthday song and all of that stuff.

Arthur M.,"Henderson, NV",103,451,1748,3.0,1/3/2016,"I came here with my reptilian blooded wife because she was cold and didn't want to go outside of the mall to eat somewhere after shopping. This place is OK if you want convenience in the mall and if you keep your expectations low. I've got no problem with the burgers, but you're rolling the dice with service. After a five minute wait to be sat on a Saturday night around 7 PM, we had about a five minute greet after being sat in the bar area and the service seemed to be a step behind for the rest of the meal especially with order delivery and refills. The burger selection, which they group into three categories, is actually pretty large: gourmet, finest, and tavern. There are also salads, $3, $5, $7, and $9 apps, chicken entrees, and soups. We kept it pretty simple ordering the Tavern Double for my wife, the Sautéed Shroom burger for me, and sharing regular fries. I can't complain about my burger, ordering with pink, it was juicy with healthy serving of mushrooms and melted Swiss cheese on the burger. The fries were sufficient. I have had most of the gourmet burgers and they're all good depending if you have a craving. The Chili Chili Cheeseburger is a combination on a burger that I like that is isn't offered in a lot of places. I swiped my credit card at the table and paid. After I asked my wife if she wanted me to pull the car around to pick her up, she declined and braved the 47 degree weather trek in the tundra to the  car. I see us coming back as a tertiary option or if we want a burger and don't want to leave the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=20
Chris V.,"Henderson, NV",773,898,4988,4.0,11/18/2015,"I said I would've given it four stars last year if not for the fries. Well, I figured out a fix for the fries. Went back to Red Robin for my birthday again. As I said before, sign up for their rewards program (Red Robin Royalty) and they'll load a free burger onto your account annually during your birth month. You'll hardly have to buy your own food if you find enough places like this. Anyway, the fries thing. I asked for them to cook 'em longer on both occasions. It didn't work perfectly the first time (only a little better than the standard cook), but the bottomless steak fries definitely came out golden brown with mostly crunchy potato pieces on the second attempt. This batch was almost everything you want from fries. They're underseasoned, but just add sufficient amounts of ketchup and the Red Robin Seasoning (salt, pepper, paprika, other various spices) and you'll be fine. Or you can do with the salt and pepper grinders if that's your thing. (UPDATE 11/7/17: You can just say ""extra crispy"" to order the fries this way. I also suggest checking inside the menu for 5 complimentary sauces which you can request on the side. The ""Secret Tavern"" sauce is that creamy light-orange stuff that you'll often find everywhere by different names.) The burger was good too. This year, I went for the Whiskey River BBQ Burger (normally $10.69) with ciabatta. I listened more closely this year and realized that the server told me that my options were ""no pink"" or ""a little pink."" This gave me more realistic expectations for the meat color, and I'd say that the patty was indeed ""a little"" pink. The ciabatta was a nice, sturdy alternative to the standard bun. The burger overall was a sweet and savory treat with the namesake BBQ sauce, crispy onion straws, cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo. I might consider asking for it again without mayo since that dulled the BBQ sauce's flavor a bit. Service felt a bit sluggish with my order taking longer to start than I thought it should've, compounded by server confusion. The host didn't explain upon seating me at the bar (not my request) that I'd be ordering with the bartender-esque server, and that server didn't really introduce herself and/or explain that she'd be taking my order. I guess it wasn't so bad because the place was pretty packed at about an hour past peak lunch. After I finally got in the order, things ran smoothly enough. Well, aside from the air vent expelling cold air directly onto me, but I was fine in my jacket. Your mileage may vary. As I said before, I'll be back here or at another Red Robin every year. It's not a premium burger, but it's solid casual dining and it's fantastic when it's free. (UPDATE 12/10/15: fried mushroom app is decent, fried mozzarella stick app is very average, and #NameThatChicken burger might not even be as good as some of McDonald's ""premium"" chicken sandwiches. But at least the burger was free to people with names similar to Saint Nick or Kris Kringle. Hooray, promos!)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=20

Nate M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",3905,670,4519,2.0,6/15/2015,"Wow. I can't believe people eat this stuff on the regular.  This was my first time ever at a Red Robin and it was pretty much what I thought it would be... cookie cutter food, mundane vibe, and terrible service. Normally, I save the bad reviews for my second visit, purely to be fair. I mean everyone has a bad day, but I don't ever foresee myself coming back here. When you're with the parents, sometimes you're just too hung-over to fight for a better place to eat, hello Red Robin. After waiting fifteen minutes for a table into a partly filled dining room, we were escorted to our seats. As we walked past the miles of screaming kids and sad looking overwhelmed parents. I noticed that not only was the place was relatively empty, but the empty tables were covered in dirty plates and old food scraps. Yummy.  We sat down and were literally passed by three different servers for about ten minutes until finally a served stopped before walking by us and asked if we had been helped, ""No, not yet"", ""oh man, well you're not even my table, so I'll be right back"", wow. He did come back to take our order, but you have to realize at this point we have been in this place for almost twenty five minutes and haven't even received a glass of water.  The food was a strong meh. I ordered the Ensenada Chicken Platter, with a side salad, pre-seasoned bagged frozen food, limp salad, and tons of dressing, because what do you do to mask bad food? Drown it in sauces and salt-based spices. I know this pace is known for it's burgers, but I wasn't feeling it, sorry Red Robin.  The beer menu also confused me. They have the Stone and I believe Lagunitas logos on their beer menu, but when I asked, what kind of Stone they had on tap, the server said they didn't have any, wait what? It was all Sam Adams and Miller brands, so I ordered Iced Tea. Why add this logo to permanent, laminated alcohol menu and not even have it in stock?  Beyond the bad service, lack of good beer, and questionable food. Our bill was still pretty pricey, over sixty dollars for three people at chain restaurant?

Our waitress had an attitude whenever we got her attention, as if we were a major bother to her. Not that we were able to get her attention often, as she was nowhere to be seen for most of our visit. When our food was served, we had to ask for silverware. We had to ask for water refills and be patient about getting them. It took ages to get anyone's attention to ask for more of the bottomless fries, and it took about 20 minutes after asking for them to bring us a measly amount. We would've like to have had more, but decided against asking as we didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for them. At least the food we *did* get was good. The new little ordering tablets they have on the tables would be awesome if they were there to supplement the service (as I imagine they're intended to do), but it appears some of the staff view them as a replacement for face-to-face service. We come here for the food. We don't expect to be waited on hand and foot.

Bonnie P.,"Henderson, NV",217,601,120,2.0,3/17/2016,"Time after time, terribly slow service. This past visit was definitely my last for quite a while. I wasn't asked how I wanted my burger cooked. It took 40 minutes to get our meals and then the burger might as well have been hockey puck between 2 buns, because it was black and rock hard. If you're going to assume how someone likes their burger cooked... I wouldn't guess ""charred"" would be the correct answer.  Then we sat with food on our table for another 10 minutes with no one coming by to check on us and no silverware. By the time they finally came over I decided I didn't even want the burger remade because my infant was getting fussy and I didn't want to wait any longer.  They took my meal off the bill but no other action was taken. You would think, at the very least, a gift card for a free burger or 20% off next time or something. I won't be back any time soon but, given the poor level of customer service, they probably don't care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=20

Our server Victor's customer service skills need some improvement. I was greeted with a very nonchalantly ""Hey buddy"" which in my opinion is not the best way to greet a customer. Didn't introduce himself, when I asked him a question after ordering our food and he kept walking away as he vaguely answered my question. I'm still here, almost done with my burger and hasn't been back once to check on my table. The guy definitely has potential to be a good server but didn't make a very good first impression.

Chad S.,"Las Vegas, NV",425,554,1319,3.0,4/2/2015,"The last time been to Red Robin was back when lived in Colorado. Talking over twenty years ago. It was ok. Just another mass marketed chain burger restaurant. I came for lunch with visitors from the 808. This location its inside the Galleria Mall. It actually decent size for shopping mall location.  I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ Burger. It really comes down BBQ burger with fried onion rings and the basic works inside. I had no idea you could order half size or smaller size they call it. I ordered the regular size. My friend she ordered small size even then felt like that decent size. It came with your choice of sides stuck with tradition steak cut fries. The fries was not very good, under seasoned, not very hot and crispy out of the fryer. The burger thought was good. I definitely had better the same concept at other burger joints around town. We all shared the stack of onion rings. Again just ok. The presentation was kind of cool but once grabbed one nothing special about them. If anything tasted like frozen pre battered onion rings then fresh ones. Overall would say not the worst place in the world could go for burger but probably be my last last choice. The service was ok. I thought was odd that the server was passing us the bill from behind our booth in service station. Rather then coming up to the table more professional. Never rude just felt like he not engaged and came to drinks not on top of keeping full glass.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=40

I'm not even sure why I went here except as usual the line for In n Out was long, and I craved a burger. I had to do some shopping at the mall, so I went in the entrance and the photos looked delicious, so in I went. They have quite a few gourmet burger selections, and the prices were as high as I remembered from my first visit. But considering the prices of burgers, especially gourmet ones, they didn't feel outrageous as in the past. I went with the Royal Red Robin burger, with egg and bacon. It was really very good. A milkshake for $3.99 added on, it was about $18 all in with tip.  No complaints here, service was good, and you do your check out right at the table with the electronic pad. Interesting that the auto tip starts at 20%....you can adjust if you like.  Nothing fancy, but it was a good burger so 3.5 stars overall.

There was more dirty tables than people dining. Horrible and nasty. My appetizer and side fries came out 10 min after my main meal. They completely messed up my order and when i ordered extra bottomless fries took them 30 min to come out. They never refilled our drinks and the food was horrible and burger was burnt. Fries were dry and hard and burnt. They sat us outside and forgot about us. I had to call them 5 different times.

Brock H.,"Henderson, NV",0,5,,2.0,11/16/2017,Only reason they're getting two stars is because the food was alright. Ordered the ghost tavern.. Burger was good and I love their fries.. That being said the customer service was horrible! This seems to be a recurring issue every time we go. The only reason we go back is because the food is decent. We only saw our server once and that was to take our orders. I ordered an appetizer and that was never brought out..when I finally did get the attention of another server to let them know we were out of ketchup and needed more they brought us back a bottle that expired in June and  was PURPLE! And when they advertise bottomless fries I expect to get bottomless fries. Not one small basket of 6 fries throughout my entire meal. I've also eaten at the red Robbins on eastern and the service there was not much better..Red Robbins needs to get some serious training on customer service asap because I'm pretty sure a 10 year old could do better!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=40
Andrew A.,"Las Vegas, NV",136,167,256,3.0,7/18/2016,"Meh. The fries were very good. It's supposed to be unlimited but you will be hard pressed to be able to have them come fill up your glass with a second cup of water. So the unlimited fries is basically 1 refill because they take forever to refill, as in 20-30 minutes. The little red blinking light to summon your server is a farce. I turned it off after 15-20 minutes. Burgers are ok. We all ordered pink in the middle since the waiter asked. No one in our group of 3 received it pink. I got the BBQ burger which was made of bacon, patty, and some other accoutrements I can't think of. Pretty much every burger had bacon in it. Bacon is usually a filler when they cannot make it tasty using other ingredients IMO. I think avocado, or grilled onions would've made this gourmet-ish but bacon is just meh for me. Five guys burger is tastier is the verdict. I would say the server sucked but he was busy serving others and not standing around so I am going to assume the Galleria Mall RR is understaffed due to personnel shortfalls.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=40

This location is a bit difficult to get to with all the mall construction, but if you're looking for it from the inside it's in the middle of the upper level.  LOVE the bottomless fries! Had the California Chicken sandwich, and should have paid more attention because bacon, mayo, and avocado is really overkill on the same sandwich. Ended up ditching the mayo-soaked bottom bun - we're not counting calories on vacation, but damn! Decided to grab a couple drinks, and I wouldn't recommend the Long Island - ironically it tasted pretty much like a virgin mocktail, and had about the same effect. The Blue Moon shake is friggin' delicious, though, if you have room for some ice cream. :-)  Service was alright - I feel like this location is putting a lot of pressure on their staff to upsell drinks and desserts. Can't fault my server for that, so tone it down, management!  If I'm staying out in Henderson again, I'd return with a more selective eye.

After eating the dry over cooked burger the manager came to our table and asked us to pay our bill (as if to say-- you are going to pay).

Shanie A.,"Henderson, NV",40,10,12,1.0,6/24/2017,This Red Robin used to be a frequent visiting place. Now it is a place to avoid at all costs. The only good food that is served is the fries. I received a chicken sandwich with a completely soggy bun and limp lettuce. I took the sandwich apart ate the bacon out out and nothing else. My water was empty my entire meal and never got refilled. Our waitress never came to check on us while eating so there was never a chance to complain. And when coming to tell us how to pay she didn't care to acknowledge the fact my food was barley touched so I did not care to leave a tip higher than a dollar. This has now occurred on three separate occasions we have waited for around 20 mins for drinks to be taken and had terrible service through out our meal as well as very very poor quality food. I don't understand why the restaurant was upgraded in the past only to lose a lot of business and not seem to care about customer service or the quality of food any longer.

Sadly execution wise the handmade Angus Beef burger was a fail here.  I didn't taste a hint of pepper or smoky flavor at all.  Now that I think back on it could be they gave me the wrong order since it resembled more like a bbq burger with fried onions and bbq sauce.  Either way though, the patty was dry and no flavor.   I really liked the service though this time around.  The side of  Yukon potato chips and onion dip is pretty good and I like the price points for the sides 3,5 and 7 dollars.  So maybe I'll just keep this place in mind for happy hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=60

You don't go to a steak house for their mashed potatoes, right? Same thing here: you don't go to a burger joint for their fries and shakes. I can say that my waitress was a doll and was constantly checking up on us. I'm a big fan on excellent customer service, which is probably why she got a decent tip from both of us.

This time we decided to try the red Robin near us after a shopping putting. We were famished when we arrived we were sat at a table in a timely fashion and we had a waitress take our order within the first 10 minutes. After waiting 30 minutes the waitress came back apologize for the slowness of the food, filled up our drinks and told us that it wouldn't be much longer for our burgers. Despite this we waited almost another 25 minutes before our burgers came out and we could finally start eating. My burger was not very hot when it arrives and the fries were soggy. My friend's burger was dry and the meat was over cooked. She told the waitress this when she came back to check on the us and the only compensation she would offer is to make her  another burger. This was after we had waited over an hour for our food and were so hungry by the time the food finally arrived. Quite disappointed with the service and the quality of food this time for the prices we paid. I am not sure would dine there again.

There definitely needed to be some retaining with that remodel!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=60

We ordered the clucks and they came out with soggy breading.  We have been to the location on Eastern and it is way better. This location in the mall is mall quality, I guess. I could have had better food and service at the pretzel stand.  Very disappointing visit, and this is the 2nd time my wife has been here, both times with the same results.

Ignacio always goes for the Guacamole burger here on a Jalapeno bun and Uriel always gets the Burnin Love Burger on a Jalapeno bun.  Me, I love the fish & chips.  The frys here are nice crispy fat steak frys and we love em.  Ask for some before your meal and they will keep them coming free of charge.

So glad they dont look down on you or give you worse service for cashing in on a free birthday burger offer.  2 star missing because the burger came out warm. I mean the burger had no sizzle or steam. ive had fast food burgers hotter than that thing. They offer endless fries but offer about 12 with the entree. Necessitating my request for another round of 12 fries. It seems silly to be honest. Put enough on the first plate so I dont have to ask for more. Jeez oh man.

The location was very busy (around 8:30 PM on a Saturday night) but we were seated within 5-10 minutes. Our server was friendly and helpful, and we were able to watch several football games on different TVs while we waited for our food. The only reason this review gets four stars instead of five is because we waited a pretty long time. When the food came out, I realized I had ordered the wrong burger entirely (my mistake!) and they immediately offered it to replace it for me for free. Thank you Red Robin! Another thing I liked about this location is the little iPads at every table. You can either pay $1.99 to play trivia games throughout your meal (no thanks!) or pay right at the iPad by credit or debit card instead of waiting for your bill (yes please!).

Jasmine H.,"Las Vegas, NV",490,155,122,3.0,12/5/2014,"It's changed a lot since the first time I went a long while ago at least to this location, wayyyyy before I started yelping.  I guess they're trying to class it up a bit? The burgers and fries used to come in baskets but now they come on a plate which is cool but it's whatever to me. They'll still always be the same in my mind! But really we're here for the food....or at least some of us are. I decided to try the guacamole burger, minus the bacon (I don't do bacon, sorry!), and substituted mayo for chipotle aioli sauce and the regular burger for a gardein burger. So the subbing the burger for a vegetarian or vegan (they got those too) option was no charge....subbing the mayo for chipotle aioli was $0.50, it would be no big deal if there was actual sauce and if they asked me if it was okay/told me there would be a charge for subbing it. I tasted practically nothing but saw a smudge on the bottom of the burger. I'm not too happy about that. Not to mention the guacamole was a puree and well you could hardly tell it was there either. So this burger was a big bust for me and a serious disappointment.  Bottomless steak fries? I can always go for fries! They tasted the same as I always remembered. Nothing too special about them, I like it with a little bit more of their seasoning so thankfully they leave a bottle of that on the tables!  I rarely get dessert while I'm out eating dinner because I always over stuff myself, but this time I decided to treat myself and wished I didn't. I got a the red velvet cake. Normally you get a rich cream cheese icing with a moist cake. Well I got a dried cake that tasted like it was a couple days old not to mention left out all day and the rich cream cheese icing tasted nothing like cream cheese icing that I know. So I was doubly disappointed. They also ran out of all the seasonal taps that night but had one IPA on tap that I decided to try. It had a goose on it, I forgot the name, but I liked it. Nothing too special about this beer though.  I'm not a fan of being sat at by the bar, but that's where they put me and so I dealt with it. Next time I'm going to the Eastern location even if it's a bit farther from me. I think I'm a bit too disappointed with this visit to go back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=80
Briana M.,"Anthem, Las Vegas, NV",0,12,2,1.0,1/21/2017,The waiter was very nice but I'm so disappointed in the service. We waited 20 minutes just for them to take our drink order. Never coming again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=80
Gerard M.,"Escondido, CA",41,38,9,2.0,3/21/2016,"I have been a fan of Red Robin since the beginning. I generally love the fries and the Royal Red Robin burger. I recently moved to the Las Vegas area so I was used to quality service and food in my old Escondido, CA location. However, I tried eating at the Galleria location for the first time back in October and the service was slow and the fries were cold. I thought it was a fluke, but I went again with the same result, slow service and cold fries. After the 4th visit with the same results, I've concluded that this place has a problem. Then I went to another Red Robin on Eastern and had the same problems. Is it truly impossible to receive hot fries without complaining about it? Maybe these Red Robins in Henderson should reach out to the Escondido location and emulate their practices, because these two have been disappointing.  Also, the Galleria spot has a section that I always seem to be seated at that sits flush up against the mall entrance, so you essentially become a spectacle for about 1000 people as they walk into and out of the mall. It makes it feel like I'm eating at a hotdog on a stick in the food court, when all I wanted was a nice atmosphere to eat in. I don't want an audience to stare at me while I stuff my face with a Royal. The extra star I give them is for being on point with the burgers, those did not disappoint. Update: Since writing this I have been notified by their corporate office that these locations will be reviewed and might be remedied. I will be heading back to the Galleria location and I'll update my review with whether or not they are still dishing out cold French fries or not. Hopefully they will put up a wall in that section in front of the entrance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=80

Chris V.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,9,,2.0,9/21/2015,"After several hit-and-miss visits to this Red Robin location we decided to try again with a free Tavern Double burger offer.  Our previous visit in August had been wonderful, with good food and great service, so we figured what the heck. The visit included me, my daughter, and my wife.  My wife got the chicken and shrimp, my daughter got the poutine fries, I got the free tavern double burger, and we all got a tower of onion rings.  Our server started out pleasant enough, but after we ordered he essentially disappeared, only checking back once.  I'm not sure when Red Robin decided to stop filling the ketchup containers, but the one on our table was nearly empty, we grabbed the one on the table next to ours and it was almost empty too. My daughter liked the poutine fries, which were hot and flavorful.  My wife didn't care for her dinner, although hot it was lacking in the flavor department.  My tavern double was also hot, but had absolutely no flavor at all.  Onion rings were perfect.  Red Robin now utilizes the Zoisk table interface for most features you would have originally used a server for, which I'm not certain is such a great thing.  Upon reviewing the bill I noticed my tavern double hadn't been taken off the bill.  I used the button to call over the server, who explained that once I entered my loyalty number the burger would be removed from the bill, and indeed it was.  Paying through the interface is hassle free, and the ability to leave comments immediately is nice, however I was asked if I'd be interested in the longer survey which would be sent to my e-mail, so far no survey has arrived.  This isn't the first time that Red Robin hasn't seemed interested in the opinion they seem to be seeking.  After my last Yelp, Red Robin Management contacted me wanting my e-mail so we could correspond, but once I sent my e-mail I received no further response. Longer story short, we went back the very next night, due to a friend having a free birthday burger.  Food quality and service were no better - and again I left a long response via the Zoisk interface and also agreed to a longer survey by e-mail and still haven't received any response by management.  For example, waited at least 10 minutes to have our drink orders taken, being asked if we would like some fries while we wait - 20 minutes later, food comes, and we're still waiting for the fries...the table next to us had been their before we came and we got our food first and this was after almost a 45 minute wait!  I can't see spending good money on mediocre food and service when there are so many better places to spend it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=80
Anthony C.,"Boulder City, NV",0,22,,3.0,8/1/2015,"Good overall experience but I HATE BEING LIED TO! Beware the FALSE ADVERTISING!  Upgrade to a mega shake with a refill and don't expect a refill.  After asking for the refill two employees explained that they don't have bottomless milkshakes. We didn't ask for a bottomless (unlimited refills) milkshake, we asked for the refill as advertised in the menu. One of the employees then explained the small extra portion in the metal mixing cup served with the glass was supposed to be the refill. Would that have refilled the glass cup? No way!  Milkshake tradition dictates that the milkshake be served with the leftovers in the mixing cup. This has NEVER been considered a refill.

Jennifer F.,"San Jose, CA",19,82,20,5.0,5/30/2016,"Lots of gourmet places here in Vegas. Since I live in Henderson, the closest will probably be the one at the M casino ( some gourmet burger and brews place ) anyhow, there are also a few places around town claiming their burgers are gourmet and some knock out fries ( will not mention that place ) come to find out when I get there that most of these places are just another Restaurant Depot ( good place to shop for business ) material product that are pretty much very pre made added with some seasoning. but I have to admit that Red Robin gourmet Burgers are pretty dang good with the bottomless garlic fries and ranch ........ Yum. Just writing this review makes me wanna go back there tomorrow and get down on some crazy Banzai Burgers with garlic fries, unfortunately I can't be pounding on burgers because I can't afford to get any bigger than I am already. But I shall be back. And soon.... When I have a cheat day which is almost everyday. I am so down to pound down that burger. The price of these burgers are almost as much if you go to fat burger or Carl's Jr. It's crazy.... So red robin for me is the way to go. I am not too crazy about burgers but when I am craving for it..... Yes let's go. Plus this location is so perfect ( galleria mall ) eat ( red R ...shop .... dessert ( Cinnabon).  My experience with service in this location has always bee gnarly....

Jessica G.,"Eastside, Las Vegas, NV",69,78,42,2.0,4/7/2013,"I hadn't been to a Red Robin for a while and remembered really liking it (as far as a chain burger is concerned).  When my husband asked me to meet him there for lunch after he and his daughter were done shopping, I readily agreed.   Big Mistake. 1.  Filthy.  Really disgustingly dirty.  There were plates and food on tables that was there before we got there and was still there when we left over an hour later.  Our waitress spilled some iced tea on the table and the floor next to us while she was pouring.  I'm going to guess 4 oz or so.  No big deal - it happens... But then, she didn't clean it up.  We were probably there another 20-30 min after the tea... there was still a puddle on the floor.   2.  Miserable service.  I got there last & my husband had asked the server to bring me water so it would be on the table when I got there.  That was there... but she never refilled it or asked me if I wanted anything else.  I wanted a soda - but never had the opportunity to order it.  My husband had also asked before I got there, when I sat down and again when we ordered, if we could have a basket of fries as a starter (we ordered burgers, so it was part of our food).  They didn't get there until the rest of our order got there.  I was there over 30 min before we got food - he'd been there almost 10 min before me.  40 min.  And it wasn't particularly busy.  There were a few groups at tables, but at 3pm on a Sunday - the place was over 50% empty.  We weren't checked on, even after we had issues with the food (see below).   3.  Mediocre (at best) Food.  When we finally did get food, it was mediocre at best.  My fries were ice cold.  They felt like they'd been sitting under the AC duct for a while.  I actually refused them because they were so cold.  My burger was passably warm and not particularly tasty.  It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't wasn't great.  I could make something better at home.  My husband's burger was even less warm than mine.  He said it was ok, but would have probably been tasty if it was warm.  His daughter had a turkey sandwich and soup.  She says hers was excellent.... so 1/3 of the party was happy.

I've been here quite a few times, and never leave disappointed.  This time was no exception (other than a small snafu with the service). They have a new addition to their menu, where they are offering small plates at different price points.  We decided to share the wedge salad for $3.  It was small, but since we were ordering meals, it was perfect to share and really good!  I also received a beer, which I never received (more on that later). My Mom had the seafood platter, which was surprisingly REALLY good.  The clams were perfect, as were the shrimp and cod.  We would definitely order this again, and it was reasonably priced at $13.99 (a lot of food). I had the patty melt.  It was good - nothing too exciting, but it's hard to really screw up a patty melt.  I love that they serve thousand island dressing on the side - more places should do so.   When our food was delivered, our server also brought a 3rd entree, which we didn't order.  When we told him this, he said that I ordered the ""Oktoberfest,"" to which I explained that I ordered the BEER, not another burger.  What kind of fat asses does he think we are?! Haha...anyhow, he took the extra burger away, removed the charge from our bill and brough my beer, so all was well. Prices are decent, and I like that you get bottomless fries.  Also, the freckled (strawberry) lemonade is refreshing and good.

Amelinda L.,"Las Vegas, NV",956,641,6517,2.0,2/12/2013,"It's been a LONG time since I've been to one and I wasn't expecting too much since the only thing I recalled was liking the lemonade and bottomless fries. Anyway, Ruben and I met up with a couple of friends on a busy Sunday afternoon. They were thoughtful enough to mention to our server that I would be looking for Vegetarian eats, so I was given the allergy binder (yeah, no information for Vegetarians, just FYI). I ordered the Bacon Guacamole Burger with a substitution of a Gardenburger® and removed the bacon and mayo. I did indulge in the bottomless fries, but was really disappointed that you're given less than ten fries to start. Seriously? I know it's unlimited, but give people a nice amount and maybe you won't have multiple orders of more fries. Our server was really great though and I asked her to bring us more as soon as we got our orders (this took a while, but like I mentioned, it was busy). I liked the Gardenburger® (first time trying it, but I had done research between this and Boca Burgers; I like the idea of vegetables in a patty form rather than soy meat) and the guacamole was okay. There was barely any flavor and the vegetables were blah (the shredded lettuce was sad). The bun was all right, a tad dry. Overall, not pleased. The fries were disappointing too! I remember them being so much better too. I know they're probably just from a frozen bag, but it was not cooked well (WAY too oily) and the Red Robin Seasoning I remember enjoying was just meh too. Anyway, I thought maybe I didn't enjoy my burger since it was a ""healthy"" version, however, I took a bite of Ruben's Burnin' Love Burger and it was just okay. He, not being as picky as I am, thought everything was just okay as well. My verdict? That was my last time dining there. Nothing phenomenal and with so many awesome burger joints in the valley, you can absolutely get something more for your money (and for just a couple dollars more).

The beer my husband wanted they ran out. He asked her what she would recommend and she didn't have too much suggestions so my husband end up having water. Then our food arrived. There was no utensils and waited for our waitress but she was no where in site so we used the device. On top of the device it was blinking red so the staff could see we needed help. We counted 10 staff members passing by looking directly at the device and did not check to see if we needed help. Our fries was cold and stale and we got our food.

Right when we entered, the service was quick and our server was really nice. The waiter came around multiple times throughout checking in when we needed refills on drinks and french fries. I had ordered the Burnin Love burger hearing from my friend that it was really good. And he was right! Though Burnin Love consist of fried jalapeno circle rings, it did not make the heat too spicy or ruin my taste buds. Rather, it gave a smokey taste in the burger. I usually can tolerate spicy really well, so that may be the reason as well. In addition, the burger is really filling! And the portion is decent! The seasoning that is available to be placed on your fries, be sure to try it! I love the dry spice seasoning, I never thought about such an idea! It made the fries have an explosion of flavors in your mouth. In addition, our server also brought us two sauces, ranch and a mustard poppy-seed one. Mustard poppy-seed was a new sauce for me, however, it was pretty good. If you are into a sweeter sauce, that one is a definite to try! I was very satisfied with the service and the food here.

Fun kitsch ambiance (like Appleby's/TGIF); casual American dining. One of three locations left in Las Vegas. All good reasons to come on down.  The best ones to try: Whiskey River BBQ Burger (my husband's favorite, so he always orders this one), Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Sandwich (my favorite), Blackened Chicken Sandwich, Fish sandwich, and Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap (I might order this one again- that's how good it was). I don't really like steak fries but theirs is very good. My husband always asks for ranch. The lemonade is really good. Both the fries and the lemonade are bottomless.

JoAnne M.,"Las Vegas, NV",10,18,,2.0,12/21/2015,"Here's a recent update:  Having returned because of a very nice manager, we were unhappily surprised by changes.  To wit:  They have now put on the tables those electronic things where you order your food (yes, I know they have them at Applebee's, and that's why we never eat there).  You use them order your appetizers, drinks and desserts.  The only thing you order from the server is your entree.  When our server showed up - after a really long time - she told us she was late because she was tired from having worked a double shift the day before.  I don't care.  Your job is to be on time, not making customers wait.  Then when I questioned her about the little kiosk, she told us everyone has them now (no, they don't) and also told us she didn't have to worry about her job because she was 'irreplaceable.'  Really?  The cemetery is full of irreplaceable people.  After we ordered, we never saw her again.  (The food was brought out by an expediter).  She never even refilled our drinks, or came over to see if the shake we ordered was any good. So here's the bottom line:  Order appetizer from kiosk.  Order drinks (non-alcoholic) from kiosk.  Order entree from server.  Order dessert from kiosk.  Pay with a credit card at kiosk.  Practically self-service now.  Since the server is doing 1/4 of the work (3/4 being done by machine) does she deserve a full tip?  No.  Only 1/4 work deserves 1/4 tip.  If I want self-service, I'll get fast food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=120

This salad is finished with diced red and green bell peppers and onions, black beans, roasted corn, cheddar cheese and crunchy tortilla strips.  This salad was good!

While the staples were all still there such as the bottomless fries and strawberry lemonade, the Clucks (chicken strips) were sub par at best. Not sure if they were left under the heat lamp to long or what but they were barely warm at best. Also, being that I ordered them buffalo style, I am used to them drowning them in hot sauce but this time it looks like they barely dipped them on one side only. Lydia N's sandwich while good in theory came out soggy and with a funky tasting sauce that just didn't seem to compliment such as simple item. See her review for what she ordered.

Other waiters were bringing fries out before people even got their food.  I spoke to a manager twice, she ended up comping the entire check.  I do think it was an issue with the server as I didn't observe a restaurant wide problem and it was a very busy afternoon.

I haven't gone to Red Robin for over three years and I finally decided to come back again.   Food (3) I ordered the Whiskey River, BBQ Chicken wrap a few weeks ago. I was pretty excited to try this entree and it was okay.  I wish there was a little more sauce in it and the wrap was really dry and hard.  It didn't taste fresh like it should be.  In addition I tried a Baja-Turkey sandwich Club. Please do NOT order this. It tasted horrible, the sauce that they mixed with the sandwich did not compliment the turkey club the way it should be.  I was hungry, so I kept eating it.  However, the more I ate it the more the sandwich started to taste gross and the sauce makes the bread pretty soggy.  Drinks: (3) I ordered the Bourbon Honey Lemonade, mmmh it reminds of something that you should drink if you have a cold or sore throat. It was o-k, but not something I would ever order again.  Service (4) All the hostess and waiters/ess were all very friendly and super easy going.  Very attentive and they did a great job serving all the customers that they had in their restaurant.

After hearing all the hub bub from people over the years about Red Robin, I decided to  throw in the towel and give them a try. Hailed as gourmet hamburgers, I took the bait hook,line and bacon. The place wasn't too crowded my waitress was very kind and attentive. I browsed over the large menu and was quite famished after not eating all day, so everything looked good. I asked the waitress for her recommendation, and ordered something similar. I believe it was the steakhouse burger or something like that. I also ordered pretzel bite appetizer to calm the hunger beast inside my stomach. The pretzel bites weren't anything to yelp home about. So there wen't 5$. The burger finally came, and looked to be pretty above average. Each burger comes with endless steak fries, which are very delicious. The burger was kinda meh.. I was expecting more razzle dazzle based on their reputation. I've experienced better and cheaper burgers at establishments that aren't even famous for their burgers.

Tim B.,"Henderson, NV",22,23,24,1.0,2/17/2015,"To begin, I'm not usually one to dine out at chain restaurants. It was late though and a few of our usual spots were already closed on a Tuesday night. After settling on Red Robin, we walked in to be greeted promptly. The hostess than had us wait a few minutes as she walked away, which I assumed was to clean a table. Needless to say, she returns and takes us in the opposite direction and attempts to seat us at a dirty table. She quickly noticed it wasn't clean and took us to another.... Which was dirty as well! WTF.... Clean the damn tables please. So we stand there awkwardly as she heads to find someone to clean it. I look around the corner and there is a dining area of about 15 tables that are all empty. I have worked in restaurants and know that the section was already closed and detailed but why keep us hovering awkwardly. Finally someone, who I guess was the manager comes and wipes down the table but leaves it much too wet. She tells us she will be right back to dry it off. At this point I am irritated, and not one person has yet to apologize. We sit finally and immediately notice how disgusting the floor is. That shit hasn't been swept in months it seems! Food, napkins, utensils and everything in between. I was horrified at this point and after waiting another 5 minutes for a server just got up and left. What a nightmare this place is!! I wish I could give it negative stars. I will literally never again dine in any Red Robin again in my life.

Decided to pop in and relax while I had a little lunch - seeing how shopping can really drain your energy as well as your wallet.  I know what you're thinking - Red Robin? There's a TON of great places to eat in Vegas - why the hell would you end up there?  Well- I was craving a great burger, and I needed one FAST. This RR is probably just like all the other RRs you've ever walked into in your entire life.  I was seated in a small table near the window, looking into the busy Galleria mall.  After checking out the menu, I decided on a ""Keep it Simple"" plain burger.   The server apologized for the longish wait and took my order.  It took what I thought was a long time for my food to finally arrive - but I was pleased with both the quality and how large my burger was.  I wasn't in a big hurry, so the wait didn't really bother me. If you're in the mood for a gourmet burger, check out RR in the Galleria mall.  I'd like to explore the menu and try different burgers the next time I'm there. 3 outta 5 stars from me - worth checking out if you're in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=160

Raina M.,"Las Vegas, NV",192,294,234,3.0,6/1/2011,"I have always liked the food at Red Robin. My husband and I have been regulars at the Irvine Spectrum location for the past few years when we lived in California. So I am kind of disappointed that there are only a few locations here in Nevada.  Here are some of my favorites on the menu: 1. Creamy Artichoke & Spinach Dip: I think the best one is at CPK, but this comes in at a close second! I could eat this as a meal. 2. Clucks & Fries 3. Caesar's Chicken Wrap 4. BLTA Croissant (Bacon, Lettuce, Turkey, & Avocado) 5. Freckled Lemonade 6. Bottomless Steak Fries - of course! What really disappointed me about this location was the service. Our server wasn't too friendly and it took her a while to finally come to our table and take our order. I ordered the Caesar's Chicken Wrap, which comes with melon and steak fries. I told her ""No melon, just fries."" Well, apparently No melon = More melon and NO FRIES! I was disappointed when I got my order, which was delivered to us by another employee. Since our server was nowhere in sight, my husband and I just shared the fries that he got with his burger. We figured it was bottomless anyway, and would just order more if needed. Also, there were no utensils or napkins on our table so we had to ask for those as well. The Red Robin restaurants in California always gave us a set of utensils wrapped in a napkin as soon as we sat down.  The food here is great! Too bad the service is pretty horrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=160

But let me elaborate with a few examples.  1. One day I get a ton of fries, the next visit, I get like 12 fries. Literally, it was a sad little portion. They do bottomless fries, so it's totally not a big deal, again it's about consistency.  2. Service!!! One day I am blown away by the host, to server, to the management. Most recent visit, total opposite! Our waitress went missing. I literally seen everyone but her. She didn't check up on us, by the time she did, we were ready for boxes. She forgot my side of dipping sauce, as well as my ice water. Just basic, easy, not paying attention mistakes.  3. The freckled lemonade. I know they have a recipe, no reason for it to be watered down- EVER.  I like the burgers here, which is why I return. I love the decor, the new look. The family style concept.

Anthony G.,"Las Vegas, NV",186,155,17,3.0,11/26/2012,"Had a bit of a hiatus from writing reviews.  Needed to clear my head a bit because as you know this is very important and soul crushing work.  Well so begins review-a-thon 2012! I've been to this Red Robin several times over the years, back in the day it was a regular stop on Galleria Mall shopping trips.  Since the Internet has nearly completely taken over my life and I don't have a need for such a thing as a ""shopping mall"" I rarely find myself there anymore.  Somehow, someway it's become a meeting place for a group of friends of mine lately when we've all been in that area, so here goes: I've got to say that years ago Red Robin was probably my favorite Burger joint in Las Vegas with the exception of In N Out.   At that point all that I really knew was fast food burgers, so RR was always a breath of fresh air from those.   Well times have changed, and much like my Motorola RAZR in comparison to my iPhone, RR's burgers have taken a backseat to newer, sexier models of burger that I can get from places like Bachi, Fuku, or one of the 50 burger places that opened in the last 12 hours.   That being said, Robin still puts out a decent quality product for my money.  The beer is cold, the ingredients usually taste fresh, service is generally friendly and I'd be remiss not to mention the bottomless steak fries that you get with every order.  My favorite is probably the Burnin Love because jalapenos and burgers are one of my preferred combinations.   Ultimately I wouldn't recommend seeking out a Red Robin if you're craving a burger and are near one of the Bachi locations or even an In N Out, but if you find yourself trapped in the Build a Bear Workshop, Hot Topic, Abercrombie and Fitch or some other shopping mall clone at the Galleria one day and you don't feel like Sbarro, Red Robin might be worth a go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=180

Ashley B.,"Las Vegas, NV",392,719,51,3.0,8/21/2012,"Red Robin is and always will be a mediocre hamburger restaurant with a variety of appetizers. The entire menu is burgers, that's their thing. I guess you also have to mention they have the speckled lemonades and decent iced tea as well.  My last venture to Red Robin was because I was out with a friend in Henderson and we needed a place to grab lunch. Well, I hadn't been to Red Robin in awhile so we figured hey why not. We arrived a bit after lunchtime so the place was pretty dead. We were seated fairly promptly and the service was good. Our waiter didn't mess up our order, he checked up on us, etc.  I ordered a chicken sandwich. Honestly I can't even remember the name, but it was of the grilled variety. The only thing I can really say about it is I did not enjoy the super white breaded bun it came on. I just think I've become used to better slices of bread. I've become spoiled by other places I suppose. My friend ordered a chicken sandwich as well and I believe hers had some pineapples on it.  Their large steak fries were tasty and add a bit of variety to the meal. The waiter also asked us if we would like certain types of sauces to dip the fries in, which was nice of him. Overall the food was okay, the service was very nice and competent, the restaurant was clean, and so was the bathroom. They do have a bar at the back of this location. I didn't realize that came standard with Red Robin, but hey, it does. Would I be back? Hmmm. Possibly. But there are a lot of better places to get a burger in Vegas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=180
Renae G.,"Henderson, NV",0,1,,2.0,10/30/2015,"Terrible service.  Upon arrival we were seated and our server promptly came over to ask for our drink order.  She was very matter of fact and certainly didn't exude friendliness. When we tried to order our appetizer she was a bit snarky telling us she doesn't take appetizer orders and that we should order them ourselves off the kiosk on the table.  She attempted to show us how to order from the table then got frustrated because the machine wasn't working. She said she would be back after she activated the machine.  She walked away annoyed.  She returned, placed our app order and her demeanor was a bit nicer, she took our dinner order at this time as well.  We then proceeded to wait 40 minutes with no appetizers nor visit from the server. We were just about to walk out and go somewhere else for dinner when our meals arrived.  No appetizers just our entrees. (cold) We told the kind young lady that brought our food we hadn't received our appetizers but no longer wanted them.  A few minutes after we received our entrees our server showed up with the appetizers.   We sent them back. The likelihood of us returning is slim to none however, I gave this review two stars for one reason alone and that would be the assistant manager Doreen.  She tried to make everything as right as possible.  She took over for our server and was extremely attentive.

Thought red robin would be a great choice as opposed to Chevy's, hostess greeted us just fine got us our table in a timely manner. However the server we were given, seemed as if he was under pressure, in a rush, and rude. Asked us what we'd like to drink so we got our water and coke. Never received a refill after that, When I asked said, ""I'll bring it right over!"" Never came and asked again and never got it. Got my order wrong, never came by for refills, was rude to neighboring tables and could clearly see the look on their faces. Asked for a basket of fries and get them shoved in my face before I could even finish my sentence. And they were clearly from the table behind us that didn't want theirs with salt on it. Watched as the bus boy cleared a table and wipe with a dry rag. Cleaning our table as we usually do before we leave a restaurant, and dropped a cup of ranch on the floor. Asked another server for a rag or napkins, given 2 napkins to clean it up I asked the hostess for a rag because all I did was smear it, she said I'll bring you one, never did. As I saw our server to get the check he was bringing drinks to the table behind us, left a trail of water spilling out of the glass and 3 other employees walked right over it over a 5 minute period. I got the check left the money our server immediately grabbed it walked away and then said thanks for coming in. On the way out alerted the hostess that she never got the rag, then she said , ""oh I'll get right on that "" Didn't get a thank you or have a nice day. All in all poor service, can't get a simple order right and no one has any concern for safety.

Denise S.,"Las Vegas, NV",170,15,1,1.0,12/15/2011,"So, I should preface this with sharing the fact that I used to work at Red Robin (for 5 years) and I was a trainer (both in store and on a regional level). It's been awhile since I've gone to a Red Robin, so either the company model has fallen to the wayside, or my experience today was a fluke.  Either way it was unacceptable.   My friend and I went, and upon walking in there were 2 employees talking at the host stand..when the Hospo (host) finally acknowledged us, it wasn't with a warm greeting, it was mere eye contact, and dull at that.  Sensing a disconnect, I piped up with ""There's 2 of us Please.""  He took us to our seats, sat us and told us in a monotone voice that ""your waitress would be right with you.""  I know it's not a big deal..but at Red Robin, branding is everything..and the wait staff is referred to as ""Servers"".  But whatever.    Expected the 30 second greet, I was disappointed,  but I remembered what it was like for me sometimes, so I shrugged that off.  Though we did sit there for a good 5 minutes.  Long enough to go back and forth on which burger to order and what to have as a side, etc.   The server finally got over to us (I kick myself for not remembering her name..I think it was Mitzy or something uncommon.  She was on the older side, Caucasian, brownish hair.)  She was pleasant enough at first.  So we ordered our drinks and placed our food order.  Since it was my friends birthday, she informed the server that she had a credit for a free birthday burger in case it mattered either way.  The server didn't offer any birthday wishes, but instead seemed kind of blah about having us at her table with that new information.  Having been a server for this company that (used to) basically bend over backwards for the guest, I was surprised, but again, whatever.  It's important (and only fair) that I mention that she was never outright RUDE.   Our food comes, she brings us additional napkins and topped off my iced tea.  At that point I looked around at all the servers to note the collective disposition:  only 1-2 seemed happy or at least GOOD at faking a sense of happiness.  The rest seemed a range from blah to outright angst at having to be there. The bill comes and the server leaves it without asking for the Loyalty card that had my friends free bday burger credit on it.  I get that perhaps her memory isn't incredibly sharp, so I can't hold that against her.   We put the card in with the extra payment for our drinks, etc.  She comes, takes it, and brings it back.  It's only as shes turning to walk away from the table do we hear a ""thanks"" in a monotonous tone.  The change was $2 (on a $20 bill discounted down to $7) so that's what we left.  *shrugs*  I didn't feel that she did anything to deserve more.  The final straw of this decision was that she never once said a simple ""Happy Birthday"" to my friend, even after it was mentioned in the beginning and, of course, when she ran the promotional credit for the bday burger.   Essentially she treated us like we were going to be a waste of her time/not tip well, so I had no issue helping her to fulfill her own self-made prophesy  :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=180

Gio C.,"San Diego, CA",23,17,2,2.0,12/15/2013,"Had lunch at this location while visiting recently. I've never been to Red Robin before  so I was really looking forward to their burgers. Took about half an hour to get seated, but it was busy and at a mall location. Our initial waiter was nice, but the wait time for the food to arrive after we ordered took an hour. In that time I watched two tables finish their meals, and two new groups get seated and finish their entire meal before our food arrived. We had drank all our water while waiting so it would have been nice if our server came by to check on us and refill our water glasses. When the food finally did come it was delivered by the manager who apologized and blamed the cooks. A waitress came by a few minutes later with the sauces for our burgers. She said she noticed them in the kitchen and assumed it was part of our order. She seemed annoyed and unfriendly, but I couldn't tell if it was because of us or something else. The burgers and fries were decent -- not great, but not bad. We could tell that some of the burgers had been sitting a while because they weren't warm at all. The milkshakes were amazing. I was starving so I wolfed down my ""bottomless"" fries. I wanted to get more fries but our waiter had completely disappeared at this point, and I wasn't sure how long it would take to bring more out. Our waiter did show up again at the end to bring us the bill. I wasn't the one who paid the bill, but I was disappointed it wasn't discounted since we had to wait an hour for the food, that hour wait affected the quality of the food, and the service was not that great. When I've had bad experiences at other restaurants before, our bill was discounted/comped or we were offered some food as a make-good to make up for a bad dining experience, and those times weren't as ridiculous as our visit to this Red Robin. Verdict: if you want a warm/fresh gourmet burger next time, you'd be better off ordering a Six Dollar Burger at Carl's Jr. Or really, any other fancy burger chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=180

I also ordered a beer while I waited for my food.  The burger and fries came out pretty fast and was delivered with ranch as well, which is always nice to not have to ask for. Amanda checked on me shortly after it came out to see if I needed anything. While I enjoyed my meal, the manager (didn't catch his name) who was working on various things said hello several times and asked me how the food was and called me by name (apparently he had been told I was taking them up on the free burger promo). Overall I found the staff to be very pleasant and I actually felt like they were glad I participated in the promo and appreciated me coming in as opposed to being treated like a freeloader who just came in for a cheap meal.  To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of the food at Red Robin, the burgers are good and the fries are okay, but I keep coming back to this location because the staff has always been consistently pleasant at this location. 5/5 for service, 4/5 for food, rounding up because I was treated right.

Nikki W.,"Henderson, NV",0,6,,1.0,2/23/2015,"Where to start...well let's just say we will never come back to red robin. we went at around 230 in the afternoon and didn't leave Red Robin till after 4. we were told the wait would be about 15 20 minutes which turned into 30, fine I understand that some places get busy not a big deal. We sat down we were greeted by Irene she seemed very sweet. She took our drink order and we also put in the kids meals right away too. my sister was visiting out of town so it was me, my mom, my sister and her daughter and my son. we also ordered chips and salsa. we got our drinks right away but couldn't get our appetizer for at least 15 minutes and the kids meals never arrived. I asked her what was going on she said she didn't know all that she knew was that the kitchen was backed up. so no explanation as we just sat there and continue to wait.  no manager ever came to apologize or ask us if we were okay, we also watched three different tables walk out. our food finally got there after 40 minutes but it was just me my sister and my mom's food, still no kids meals!!! we said that this was unacceptable and we asked to have our kids meals and why they were not there. a girl came by and said to Irene it was never put in, the kitchen had no ticket for it. finally the other girl ran back to the kitchen and got our kids meals after another 10 minutes. we still were missing one of the sides with the kids meals and it also never came. all of our food was cold it was awful but we still ate it because we were so hungry and had waited so long. finally we got the bill because we just wanted to get out of there and nothing had been discounted or taken off for all that we had been put through. so I asked for the kids meals to be removed, which they did and it took 12 dollars off of our bill. not to mention that the place was pretty dirty and it seemed like nobody really cared. We also watched one of the male servers walk by and wipe his nose with his hand like he had a cold, at that point I put my burger down and was done eating. I am a former server myself I have done this my whole life and never have I been the type to complain but this was the worst thing that we have ever seen in a restaurant and the lack of people to care. usually a manager comes over and tries to reassure the table or will give you some type of comp or let you know that they care and this did not even happen. never have we been so disappointed.

Needless to say, this place isn't all that great. I can come here to eat every now and then, but it's not off the wall where I tend to want to come back more than often. We ordered an onion ring tower which was HUGE! and ok tasting. I'm not much of a onion ring lover and that might have an impact on why I didn't think it tasted great. Me and the wifey also shared a chicken pasta which wasn't all that tasty in my opinion, probably won't ever order it again. But what I do like about this place is their fish, fries and shrimp sampler appetizer, although we didn't order it at the time we came to this place, I did have it a few times when coming to another Red Robin and I do recommend it to others when coming here. All in all this place doesn't deserve more than 3 stars as food wasn't that great here when we ate.

I will say the food was pretty good, hence the one star, but we did rush to eat and regrettably had no dessert because we just wanted to leave; it was that unpleasant, and we honestly took it very personal. this was my VERY FIRST review, and I never do this, but the service there to me was that unpleasant to break that chain!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=220

Taylor C.,"Las Vegas, NV",239,155,1,4.0,4/25/2010,"This place opened up in the Galleria Mall about 10 years back. While a national chain, I had never heard of it prior to this.  I had been missing out. Red Robin is American-style food at its finest. The place has an upbeat, colorful atmosphere, along with a few arcade games. The menu is pretty diverse, and it's highly unlike you'll be coming here and not finding something that appeals to you. They even have shakes/malts, and I guarantee they will be some of the finest you have ever tasted. The place has excellent fries, and with pretty much any food item you paid for you get an unlimited supply during your meal. Not bad for all the people that can't get enough food. The service tends to be a bit hit-and-miss at times. Sometimes I have gone for minutes on end with no one coming to me. During one visit I didn't even get my malt until after I had received my food! Plus, they are terrible at taking the request of not including ranch with your chicken fingers - and this IS a big deal, considering it is an unsealed container and CAN spill out onto them. Still, the faults are minor in the long run. I've been going to this place since they opened up here, and probably always will. Nothing is so wrong with this place that it will keep me away.

As I have said in a few of my other reviews everywhere has its off days. Being a frequent customer here I walk in knowing what I am gonna get. I always sit down order my drink and a few baskets of their BOTTOMLESS Steak Fries which come with any burger order. I almost never order an appetizer but when I do they are a taste treat :) I have tried 90% of the burgers on the menu and my all time favorite is the Bruschetta Chicken Burger. The Garlic Fries are a great addition to the plate and the burger itself is amazing. Another good choice is the Royal Red Robin Burger.

Now, other places (like my esteemed Otto's) definitely do burgers better, but this chicken sandwich is absolutely dynamite.  A big, thick, juice chicken breast smothered in cheddar, bbq sauce and onion straws.  It's served with bottomless steak fries, but if you get through the sandwich you're not going to have any room. If you're more of a burger fan, I've tried them before and they're definitely good!  Again, I've had better, but these puppies aren't anything to thumb your nose at if you're in the mood for some red meat.  May I suggest the Banzai Burger with teriyaki and grilled pineapple?   Boo, it's in a mall.  Boo, it's a chain.  But man, that's one tasty bird on bread.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=240

I wasn't happy that when I held the burger and noticed that the bread was cold.  Toasting or warming the bun should be customary, otherwise, why am I buying a burger when I can make a better one at home?  Good thing that the bill was less than $30.  We will not come again.  Was it a disaster?

After a 40 minute wait we finally got the salad (which had been sitting for awhile). So of course we spoke with the manager who in turn gave us an apology and a $20 gift card. Mind you, we'd already paid for the salad ($11.77) so it wasn't much of a GIFT considering it wouldn't even cover the cost of a new salad after the difference. Nonetheless, we were happy with the offer and went home to eat. Opened the salad... And the lettuce was wilted and filled with water in the bottom of the container. I called back in to speak with the manager who was kind enough to put in a rush order for not only 1 but 2 new salads and said to still keep the gift card. Thanks, Jim!

The last time we were there, we requested to sit in her section and we were informed that she was getting ready to serve a group of 24 people.  She found out that we were there and insisted that we be sat in her section and by the time we got to our table, she already had our drinks, a hot basket of fries and our special ""cold"" buzz sauce waiting for us!  Tonight, we were on the Strip and decided to go to a popular ""burger bar"" at Mandalay Bay.  We had the worst service ever, the bartender acted like we were bothering her and she was so unfriendly.  Weird enough, I think that her attitude affected the way we felt about the food there...we paid over $40 for 2 burgers and 2 sodas and left feeling ripped off.  A restaurant can have the best food around, but it is the SERVICE that makes us keep coming back to Red Robin.  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson-2?start=240

Ronald P.,"Las Vegas, NV",27,44,,3.0,6/10/2011,"My last visit to Red Robin was a perfect example of bare minimum service. What I mean by that is the lowest amount for the standard tip. 1. The 12 min. wait for a seat even though there was 9 free tables, 6 of which were in between stationed areas- the remaining 3 was probably closed off. 2. The server provided one refill for drinks. 3. Service was relatively quick, but server was not aware of terminology on their own menu. (I ordered ""bunless"" and printed on the menu, a note says, ""Order it BUNLESS, get your burger wrapped in lettuce."" Yet she still asked me if I wanted my burger to be wrapped in lettuce.) This would normally warrant a 2 star rating but oddly enough this sub par service was not as bad as most of the places I've been to as of lately. I wanna say keep it up, but you can do better.
