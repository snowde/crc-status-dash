Marisa C.,"Las Vegas, NV",9,49,24,5.0,12/31/2017,"We usually get our orders to go from the bartender Christina! My family that visits from out of town loves to eat here as well so we usually like to sit in the bar area.  I usually order the crispy chicken sandwich and the fries are bottomless when you dine in. They also have a rewards system that you can get some discounts with too.  Also their onion rings are really good, not sure what other sauce that comes with it but it does come with ranch and something else.  When my mom comes to town she loves to get her mushroom burger craving fix from here.   The mudd pie dessert is usually what we get too. It's a huge slice of ice cream pie and it's amazing! Enough to share with someone else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson
Abbey K.,"Henderson, NV",1,10,23,2.0,12/29/2017,"Wait: Came in around 2:00pm on a Friday and waited 10 minutes although there was plenty of seating to be seated right away. Service: Kind but slow. Food: Removed vegan patty option entirely from the menu and made the dishes smaller. Salads not worth the price after removing meat and cheese and other things that aren't vegan. Good options for vegetarians, but not good for vegans anymore.  Overall: Don't recommend for vegans. My dad eats everything and still is not a big fan of it. Good for kids.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson
Derek M.,"Glendale, CA",27,52,151,1.0,12/5/2017,"First and foremost I'm a huge fan of the brand. I've been a customer of RR for over 10 years. So much a fan that my family and friends typically get me a gift card for RR for the holidays or birthday. Sadly this has to be the worst RR I've been too.  Started out as soon as we walked in. They seemed extremely under staffed for lung time. We came in around 130 last Thursday. We were seated at one of the only clean table in the dining area. We counted 9 tables that hadn't been fully bused. Drink glasses everywhere. Ok, I get, slammed and short staffed. I work in the restaurant industry so I get it. We went ahead and ordered and I as always got the bottomless rootbeer floats. It's a bargain for 4.99. Tree the Blue Ribbon burger also with my bottomless fries crispy. That was the first time we saw our server. Didn't catch her name. Tattooed brunette. Well I was thirsty so the float lasted 2 minutes. Put my glass politely at the edge of the table to signal her. A runner or another server brought out our food. Our server didn't come back to see if we needed anything. We sat there for about 10 minutes waiting on someone to ask if we needed anything because we did. We needed a side of their chipotle mayo and a side of blue cheese dressing and I was in desperate need of something to drink, a refill on my route beer float. Our way to finally saw that we needed something as I politely called out to her across the dining room. I guess there were a couple of regulars and she was busy attending to them. Mind you no one has attended to the nine tables with dishes and drinks on them. She came up give us a look and we asked for the refill on the route beer float and the sides of dressing at which point she made no apology and just informed us there be a surcharge for the chipotle mayo. She brought the float back first. By the time she went to the kitchen and came back with the dressings I had already finished the second float and aspirate third. Both empty glasses remained at the table while she rushed to the bar and brought me a third glass. But now I had already finished my third float and my crispy fries were soggy from sitting around. I went ahead and ate them because I was starving. Another 15 or 20 minutes past and my fries were empty and I still had half of my burger left and yet another empty float. She came back after I had to call out to her once again. Asked for one more float and another order fries. The float came and added to the three empty glasses that I had. After she cleared the table the fries finally came out along with her pointing out that we can pay online. Not sure what the issue was, maybe they were just all having a bad day. But it's definitely not the Service and attitude I'm used to when I go to RR. Definitely won't be back to this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson
Katherine H.,"Las Vegas, NV",47,3,,1.0,1/9/2018,"Our family used to come here once a week for lunch or dinner.We stopped that with the new management that came in and things were always messed up.We decided to give them another try and to our pleasure it was great. Now comes my experience today.Pick up orders are to be picked up from the hostess now.Great...Not.We were told 19mins for our order.I arrived at 20 after 5(20mins from order time) waited in the bar due to no hostess to be found.She finally appears and ask if I am waiting for a pick up,I said yes.Now mind you it is 15mins more by now.The hostess takes care of the gentleman ahead of me.She makes eye contact,I said I am waiting for an order For Katherine,she says it is not ready yet.How does she know?She didn't even check.So I took a seat and waited.5:44pm I paid for our food.5:50pm I received our food.So I waited another 30mins for our food.Unacceptable.We are done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson
Stefany V.,"Las Vegas, NV",2180,3988,9966,3.0,9/15/2017,"Red Robin isn't my first choice for burgers, but I'm not opposed if someone else suggests it. That said, I can't remember the last time I went to one and it seems like they've made several changes: menu has expanded to offer a premium line of burgers and they have more chicken sandwiches, salads, and other non-burger entrees. There are also a lot of customization options from buns to fry sauces (some with an upcharge) and ""premium"" sides that I don't recall from previous visits. The Bleu Ribbon burger was decent, with fried onion straws and a good amount of cheese. I upgraded my fries to the garlic-parm version, which were just a sprinkle of fried garlic and a pinch of cheese added to the regular steak fries- the flavor was pretty subtle. Note that burgers here must be cooked to at least medium, for some reason.  Service at the bar was adequate and one guy in particular was especially outgoing. All seats/tables are provided with a touch screen to summon your server, review featured specials, or play games while you wait. I'm all for using tech to streamline services but pushing a button to summon the bartender right in front of you is just weird.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson
Brad D.,"Las Vegas, NV",24,103,10,4.0,10/5/2017,"The service at this location was well above what we received at the Galleria location. The fact that one can get lost in a burger menu is amazing.  You get unlimited refills on your fries or salad and we were able to actually get our waitresses attention and order a second helping (not that it was needed). I had the big Sir Acha Tavern with a salad and the wife had the Whiskey River BBQ with fries. Okay, they do not explain the Big burger to you so I asked. It is $2.5 more so you expect a bigger burger.... well hold on. It is the same 1/3 oz patties, but they are made into one burger. So same start weight, theoretically you end up with more meat in the end because the thicker burger will not cook down as far as two individual burgers. Did I notice a huge difference? No. I did notice that there was more moisture left in the big patty than when you get the smaller ones. The fries were rather good tonight, crispy outside and soft inside and the salad was actually refreshing. I had the Ghost pepper burger on my last visit, the Sir Acha seemed spicier to me. Dining room was clean and quite quiet. Waitress was attentive and our water glasses never went empty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson
Teri W.,"Henderson, NV",134,833,390,4.0,9/12/2017,"I am a fan! This is the location nearest to our house and we've never had a bad experience. This is a great place to go when you are looking for a reasonably priced variety. They are most known for their burgers, but have many other offerings as well. I joined their loyalty program awhile ago because they give you a free burger on your birthday every year. This program is pretty great - I am regularly receiving discounts, BOGO burgers and other offers. They keep track of your purchases and every 10th burger is free. I love the freckled lemonade, they have awesome shakes and you can also get bottomless root beer floats for only $4.99. Add that to their bottomless steak fries and you've got a winning combination! The service can be hit or miss, but it hasn't really been a big deal. We always enjoy our visits there and it tends to be the place we go when we can't really decide on anywhere specific.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson
Scott G.,"Savannah, GA",1,20,,4.0,11/12/2017,"The food is good. The waitress was good.  If you want to get food without hassle this is the place to go.   *the only thing that kept it from 5 stars was...* They use an on table kiosk where you can order, add to the order so on so forth and PAY.  When I went to add the tip the number is off.  My bill was $28 and change.  20% of $28 is $5.60 right??  Not at this Red Robin.  At this Red Robin 20% of $28 is $7+.  She was good but not that good.

Gerard M.,"Escondido, CA",41,38,9,1.0,1/1/2018,"Another bad service experience at Red Robin. Host sits us at a table and probably waited 15 minutes before the host noticed us sitting here with no drinks. Then she went and got our server, and he blamed it on a miscommunication between the host and server, BUT common intuition would tell you that a family of 5 sitting between two of your active tables might mean that you are assigned to serve us. Still sitting here waiting for my kids beverages to show up, if they show up at all. This place is soooooo bad consistently.

Crystal C.,"Las Vegas, NV",143,76,37,5.0,3/14/2017,"My fiance and I came here on the 12th (which was a Sunday) at 12pm for lunch on his birthday. We were fully expecting some sort of an after-church lunch rush, but were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away by a hostess who was very cheerful and kind. This essentially NEVER happens to us because we come in with a double stroller containing an our 8 month old special needs foster son and our 14 month old daughter. And to top it off, we also have our 4 year old son. We tend to enter restaurants expecting to get a ""could you please wait one moment?"" while the hostess frantically searches for an empty area somewhere that she can stick our circus. Which, by the way, we honestly don't take offense to.... we totally get it. Lol.  Anyway. We were seated right away, and greeted right away by our waitress, Vanessa. Vanessa is AWESOME. She was prompt, polite, and didn't look at us sideways NOT EVEN ONCE for bringing 3 kids under 4 out for lunch. She had our drinks and appetizer out within minutes. And by minutes, I mean MAYBE 3-4 tops. We placed our order, and even our food arrived to our table within 15 minutes. All of our food was steaming hot and SO good. I stick to a mostly vegan diet, so Red Robin is somewhat of a ""rare unicorn"" thing for me. I went all in (since it was the fiance's birthday and all) and had the new salmon sandwich. HOLY SHIT. Order this damn thing! AT ONCE! I can't even explain, it was just perfection with each bite. My fiance always gets the burnin' love burger made with chicken and swears by it.  Suffice to say, the service, the Vanessa, and the salmon were ah-mazing. Hands down the best Red Robin experience I've ever had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson
Jessica K.,"Las Vegas, NV",176,132,343,3.0,1/29/2017,"I just moved to this side of town. So, while I'm a fan of Red Robin, my 1st visit to this location left something to be desired. We popped in at around 630p on a Sunday night. The restaurant wasn't full, but the lobby area was. I'm not sure what the reason was, but we didn't have to wait any more than 5 minutes and the host was pleasant. When we were walking to our booth all I noticed was how filthy the floor was. Straw wrappers, French fries, napkins. It wasn't a few spots, it was the whole place. It was a huge turn off. We ordered 2 iced teas, an order of the pretzel bites, and split a Black Pepper Burger ($32 with the tip). Even though it seemed like a long time to get our food, I may have just been impatient. Everything was good, but the burger was like warm at best. Our service was excellent, though, so I might give them another chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson
Breanna C.,"Henderson, NV",1,24,64,1.0,11/27/2017,"First and foremost this rating does not reflect the quality of the food I've had but the management or at least one manager.  I called in and ordered a free birthday burger I had earned. After picking up the burger which was a veggie burger and getting home ready to eat it and realized that I had been given a BBQ bacon cheddar burger. I then called up and spoke to a manager who was super nice and told me to come back up and they would remake the burger and comp me a free dessert. Great I thought, well I ended up not making it back up there (long day at work and I was tired).  Fast forward to today, I make it back up there and bring in the incorrect uneaten burger to show. The manager who I spoke with the night before along with another manager who already seemed to have some sort of attitude. She told me that I'd just get the burger but no dessert. Anyone who has ever ordered from RR knows they tell you it takes 15-20 minutes for any of the burgers and fries to be prepared. The female manager came out in LESS than 5 minutes with the burger.  Obviously she couldn't be bothered to remake a fresh burger for me and the free dessert I was told I'd receive as well. I get it, some will argue and say ""But it was free anyway"", well I'd hate to see how things would've been handled had I paid for it. As a manager you can't be mad for a mistake one of your employees made when boxing up the order or that I did not come in again the same night. What if I didn't have a car or had the luxury just to come whenever? Bottom line is this whole situation was not handled appropriately and now I have two burgers I can't even eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson

Sat in the bar at a high top table there were about 4 other tables sat in bar area with one bartender which is not busy at all. Our bartender took 20 mins to take our entree order after we received apps. Which usually they would have been back shortly after putting an appetizer order in. Finally got our entree order in...20 mins after that I got up and walked to kitchen and asked for them to bag up our food as we had plans to meet friends for New year's Eve..the girl nicely said no problem and she would being it to our table sat for at least another 7-10 mins a female manager came over with our order and said here you I explained to her no one should wait Almost an hour to get a burger when the bar wasn't even busy.

With that being said, the manager (Blake) stopped by shortly after I began my meal, to ask how everything was. I said their signature cheeseburger and fries were great but mentioned that the Sangria was not so great. I had consumed about a third of the Sangria and it just tasted like flavored water. He simply said ""I'm sorry"" and walked away. I always give management a chance to make it right. I ALWAYS mention the result of that, good or bad. Nick, my waiter was great and I let him know that I wasn't happy and that I did food reviews for a hobby. The manager stopped back by and said he never ""comps"" alcohol. He said I had consumed most of it, which I did, but had he offered a replacement (or something) the first go around, I probably would have left happier. I've had alcoholic beverages with meals before, that were ""off"", and management has always made it right. I'll probably come back because the food is great.

Katelyn P.,"Las Vegas, NV",163,223,42,4.0,10/5/2016,"I have always loved this Red Robin's location. They recently updated the interior, which makes it seem even more inviting. Last night, we visited to celebrate my Dad's birthday. After some confusion by the woman at the front, we were quickly seated. I really appreciated that they removed a chair so my grandma's wheelchair could fit in place of the chair. It's the little things. Since we are regulars, we ordered as soon as our waiter came over. Our waiter was Marquese (I hope I spelled that right!) and he was super awesome, funny, and just a great guy. I asked him about the dairy free options since their online allergen menu was finicky, and he was able to answer all my questions. He took our orders back, and was quick to let us know that the kitchen was out of one of the items we ordered, but we picked something else. And, when we finished eating, they brought my dad an ice cream and sang to him! It seems silly, but I really wanted to make sure they acknowledged his birthday for him. Like I said, it's the little things. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I absolutely hate the stupid tablets on the table.  For some reason, we had 3 on our table when we sat down, and we moved the other two away without realized that they were all registered to different tables. So when it came time to pay the bill, we sat around waiting because our little tablet never lit up, because it was on someone else's table. I wish the waiters would either teach us how to use it, or just do it for us. I haven't been back here since before they started using the tablets, so I was lost when it came time to order and pay. I also dislike that their online allergen menu is wonky. I know this isn't a problem specific to this Red Robin, and luckily our waiter was knowledgeable about allergens, but I would hate to go back and get a waiter that didn't know. I just hope this review gets passed on to the people that can change this information. Overall, this is a great location to visit and I will definitely be back. Hopefully I learn how to use the tablet by then!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=20

Bradd F.,"Las Vegas, NV",299,295,172,4.0,9/19/2016,"Love Red Robin, Burgers are not super high end, but consistently good.  They have a new item on the menu, Poutine.... that I really dig.  It is not quite the same as the traditional Poutine you may have had in Canada, but it is really good...and with their garlic Aioli, it is perfect combination.   Can't beat bottomless fries either!         This time specifically,  one of my kids choked on something and ended up throwing up.   The staff and manager was excellent to deal with... they were so helpful at cleaning things up and making us feel comfortable.    Additionally, the last time we were eating here... we saw a mother and daughter eating.  The daughter was probably 9-10.  Her mother got sick and went into the bathroom.  You could see the little girl was nervous sitting there on her own.  The manager came over, sent a female staff in to help the mother, got the little girl comfortable and helped them to get their food packed up.  Very caring.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=20

Delaney P.,"Las Vegas, NV",110,101,52,2.0,8/4/2016,"Was sorely disappointed with this location. I've been to Red Robins before and have always had stellar service. This location that was not the case. It took some time for a server to even acknowledge us. Once she did we at least got water quickly but that was the extent of it. Waited some time before she came back and took our order. I had the fish and chips and the oil used to fry both was definitely old. Both tasted stale and were very dry. I did not finish my fish. As far as ""endless"" fries are concerned they gave us very few to start with and only brought one refill. Had a milkshake that we had ""split"" which means they give you two child sizes for the price of a full one. Overall not impressed and will not return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=40
Melanie V.,"Henderson, NV",96,94,9,1.0,2/6/2016,"I am super annoyed tonight. I am updating my review of this location to 1 star.  Let me say, my kids and I used to come to this location literally about one a week, several years ago. It has drastically gone downhill over time.  My little one for some reason remembered that this location has a chalk board in the lobby when we were walking through the parking lot. Got inside, only to realize they are out of chalk. First disappointment.  We were seated, and the hostess didn't give my little one any crayons or paper like they normally do. We asked the server, and we were told they are also out of crayons, but that the manager was trying to find some in the back. Second disappointment.  I ordered the freckled lemonade, which was very watered down, and only had 2 pieces of strawberry in it. Third disappointment.  I ordered the Royal burger, no bacon, with a veggie patty. The burger came out with 2 giant pieces of bacon it. Normally I would ask the kitchen to remake the burger, but based on my last experience last week at this same location, I didn't bother.  Side note, last week I ordered the croissant blta, no bacon. Of course, the sandwich came out with bacon on it. I asked them to remake the sandwich, and it was brought out just a few moments later. I took off the top piece of croissant to see, and sure enough, there were 2 holes where the wooden sticks had been put through the sandwhich. They didn't remake anything, just removed the bacon. I could have done that myself I guess. Good thing I'm not allergic!  Back to this visit. Ate my food, and drank my water I had ordered in place of the lemonade. Decided to order dessert to go. I ordered the freckled lemonade cake. I have had this dessert about 4 times now.  Well, I just opened my cake and there is no strawberry sauce or strawberries! Seriously?!? Isn't that the point? I told the manager about most of this when she stopped by our table. She didn't have much to say other than ""I'm sorry"" and ""we will try to do better."" Then she took our $4 onion rings off of the bill.  Ugh.  I am really disappointed. We used to come all the time, and have been customers since this location opened in 2005. We most likely won't be going back for a while. The service has slowly been declining. They won't even take your payment if you are using a debit card. You have to do it yourself on the little kiosk things. Super annoying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=40

Aubrei G.,"Las Vegas, NV",166,7,1,2.0,9/12/2017,"It was my first time eating at a Red Robin location. My husband and I had to wait 5 minutes for the hostess, there was only one which we understand. The first server said that he would take care of us but after 5 or 10 minutes he did not return another young lady came up and asked us if we would like something to drink over the shoulder of my husband without looking at him, and gave us water. I asked for lemon and never got it. We also ordered my husband's burger no tomato and tomato was present on the burger. We also ordered my husband burger no tomato and to meet it was present on the burger. The food was otherwise absolutely delicious which is why it makes me sad to make this review. None of the servers that we spoke to introduce themselves or apologized for any inconvenience. After calling over a supervisor he also did not introduce himself but did apologize saying that they were ""swamped, and only had 2 servers"". Me being a server I can understand that.

She said the whole restaurant was loud so we shouldn't waste our time unless we wanted to sit in the bar. We asked if we could at least try another part of the room and she again said the whole place is loud and should go to the bar.

The server was nice and replaced the plate and drink after we pointed it out and she called the manager over for us.  We talked to the manager who was, of course, very apologetic and told us not to worry about the check because ""he'd take care of it"". We debated leaving at this point, but decided to stay. The meal itself was ok, but I asked for some things on my burger that never arrived. Even after I asked for them a second time.  When it came time for the check the manager did NOT ""take care of it"". We got a bill for the full amount. Even if he wasn't going to comp the meal I at least expected he'd comp the soda.

Lucas K.,"Las Vegas, NV",65,3,,1.0,8/4/2017,"This particular location has SERIOUS issues.  Food is good (Red Robin food).  Servers lose their minds if you ask for anything out of the norm like ""do you mind if we sit somewhere that's not RIGHT NEXT TO THE KITCHEN?  Maybe in one of these 20 open booths throughout the restaurant?""  Music is too loud, manager was actually on point and I was really impressed until I watched him and one of the servers set up a table for themselves in the middle of the dining area with full blown table cloth, gloves and several bags of ""hot and juicy crawfish"" from their competitor next door.  Indulging in their food while the rest of the servers gossip behind the counter. Can't make this stuff up.  Totally unprofessional in my opinion as I look around at the crayon all over the walls, garbage all over the ground, restrooms destroyed and tables from said server are completely filthy with dishes left from the last customer.  We've been burned at this same location twice before but thought we'd give it another go.  NOPE.  This place is garbage.  Head down the road to the galleria mall location if you want to enjoy a meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=40

I have had ok service in the past and that is why this is a two star review instead of a one star review. My fiance and I came here the other day before seeing Jurassic World down the street. He ordered a Hawaiian Burger and I ordered a Chicken Ceasar wrap like always. Everything is going great until our food comes out and there is no dressing in my wrap. (Insert sad face) just a dry bed of lettuce, tomato, and a few pieces of chicken. I let our server know and he apologized and had them make a new one. The only problem is now my fiance has his food and his is getting cold because he of course doesnt want to be rude and eat while im waiting for mine so now were both in a lose lose situation. The manager brought out my food and was very nice and i really do appriciate that, (Another reason this is a two star review and not less) So I start to eat my wrap and the first half I ate was almost completely empty. Like one tiny square of chicken and a little bit of lettuce. It might as well of been an empty tortilla with dressing in it.  The worst part for me was when I bit into my second half and almost broke a tooth an a huge hard chunck of what I can only guess to be bone or cartilidge...

After 20 years of killing my poor hubby's steaks, I finally watched enough Food Network to be able to make him a perfect steak. He licked the plate. Anyway, I finally gave in and tried steak. Turns out, I LOVE beef. I started slow, but finally tried a hamburger for the first time about a month ago. I did not like it at all. Ground meat has a very odd texture to someone who has never eaten it before. It was a homemade burger. Fast forward to today. I had a gift card someone had given me, so we came in to check it out. We ordered the onion ring tower (awesome!), I got a bacon cheeseburger (huge!) with the garlic fries, one of my daughters got a burger and fries and my other daughter got the mac and cheese and steak fries (this daughter is vegetarian). I was terrified I'd hate it, but I totally get it now!!! That bacon cheeseburger has changed my life! It was simple, but exactly what I wanted. No, it was exactly what I NEEDED. I am now a fan of burgers, for the first time in my life. I'm very picky, so you can count on me to come back and order the same thing every time because I know it'll be great. I also need to mention that my daughter's mac and cheese was to DIE for! We live across town, and I almost ordered more to go so we could have it again for dinner.  Cheyenne was our server, and she was crazy busy, but super nice and really great, as was everyone else who helped us.

If you ask me, part of the fun is trying to scoop out the strawberries with your straw.  The one thing I wish they hadn't done was put the steak fries in these small metal holders so they're all standing up instead of having a little mountain of them nestled next to your burger.

You never had to ask for anything. The second time we had him he remembered us and our order and was such an awesome waiter! Our previous visit had been with Jessica and it was terrible.

When his hamburger came out the chili look like it was four days old ,I've seen better chilli come out of a can. I asked him if you need a fork and knife to eat it and he told me no the chili was like glue and everything stuck together .My sandwich was ok the bottom was soggy  and you could tell it had been sitting for awhile . The french fries seem like they were cooked and left in a warmer for hours . I ordered a second batch of fries thinking they would make them fresh I was wrong same crappy fries. You also only get apparently eight fries with every order, but they claim endless fries. Needless to say I will never go back the food was crap as well as the service .

Anyway, we went to this location 2 nights ago.  Fries were still good.  But they seemed to come out slower and in less quantity that I had recalled from my youth.  Also, the burgers seemed to be smaller and of inferior quality than I remember.  Balloons are no longer filled with helium.  Instead, you get balloons that are attached at the end of plastic sticks.   To me, it seems as if the bean counters got too much influence over the folks in charge of product quality.  We could be witnessing a slow death...  Mr. Red Robbin Chairman, please take this company back from the cost-cutters.  You cannot shrink your way to growth.

They said bottomless fries and coleslaw, but be prepared to wait a long time to even get a replacement side. The tablet on the table is sneaky, you might press on a game and there is no confirmation screen. You will be billed for it if you don't look closely.

We asked how he knew - and he told us how he could tell.  It's not because he has served us before, he can just tell by the age of the patrons, and his experience with the menu.  With all of the items on that menu, it amazed me. Anyway, the Tavern Double didn't fail to disappoint, Shane was excellent, and we'll be back, for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=60
Creshaun O.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,1.0,8/29/2016,So we drove across town to eat Red Robin's bottomless fries. Once we placed our order we were told they were out of fries? Crazy huh?

James S.,"Henderson, NV",45,111,143,3.0,3/26/2016,This is my updated review for this location. 1 star for the quick response to management for messaging me about my previous review and trying their best to fix my bad review. The service this time was good. The host quickly greeted us and food was tasty. Our server rachel asked me if I wanted my burger with some pink in it (which made me happy since that's how I always want my burger and my previous visit the server told me the meat is too thin and it's not possible). Overall I will give the return experience 3 stars since it was fast and the server was very polite. Only drawback was it seemed a little rushed probably due to the restaurant closing in an hour. I will try this place again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=60
Amanda F.,"Las Vegas, NV",744,23,14,3.0,10/27/2016,I would have given 4 stars but the food was not as tasty as the one in Downtown Summerlin. We usually get the same burgers and some reason the quality was not the same. We walked in about 9:00 pm and a host didn't show up till about 2 minutes later and finally greeted us. It wasn't busy at all and had to wait for 5 minutes to get a table. Server was nice but not as attentive after order was taken. I would still go to Red Robin because I do enjoy their burgers but I wouldn't go out of my way this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=60

The service is so-so, we've had some great servers, and some pretty crappy ones.  Sometimes you just need some fries and campfire sauce :) -- If you haven't had this stuff yet, do it. It will change your life.  Great for family dinners or dining with a mixed crowd. Good selection of burgers, salads, chicken burgers, and other tasty options. I'm also a pretty big fan of their specialty drinks, but sometimes they can go terribly wrong.  Favorite dishes include: Whisky river BBQ burger (the chicken version is pretty good too - both are delicious when lettuce wrapped), Clam Chowder, fries, garlic fries, sweet potato fries, mango margaritas, and the mud pie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=60

Mike F.,"Las Vegas, NV",214,619,4077,5.0,8/27/2013,"We've lived in the area for over a year and this was our first visit to this Red Robin. Reading the reviews I wasn't really sure what we were going to get but this ended up being such a great experience! Granted, we went at around 8pm on a Monday night, so the place was pretty slow. In fact, I believe there were maybe 5 other tables occupied in the entire place.  So when we first walk in, we are greeted at the door and seated by the greeter and less than 2 minutes later we are greeted by our server, Steven. We order our drinks and Steven mentions a few suggestions since we had mentioned this was our first visit here. Upon his recommendation I ordered the Royal Red Robin burger(10.49), while my friend ordered the Chili Cheese burger (9.99). Both burgers came with ""Bottomless steak fries"". They do give you the option to switch those out with a different style of fries, if you wish. We stuck with the steak fries and figured we'd just go with that.  I had been craving a burger all day, so sinking my teeth into that tasty burger was sweeeeet! Very fat and juicy! Plus I love the over-easy egg on top! That was the first time I had tried that on a burger and I definitely enjoyed it! The steak fries were the thick cut variety (which I love) and were pretty tasty as well. After 2 servings, that seemed to be plenty for me. My friend seemed to thoroughly enjoy his chili cheese burger and also indicated other burgers on the menu he wanted to try out on future visits. The service was great! It was perfect that Steven was attentive and brought refills in such a timely fashion! He repeatedly checked in on us and attended to our needs during the meal. Just because a place is slow doesn't necessarily translate to great service. Trust me, I've experienced that first hand many times. But that certainly wasn't the case here! In fact everybody here was so friendly, we even had 2 other employees wish us a good night as we were heading out of the place. We were both like, ""Damn""! lol  I honestly can't think of a reason why this wasn't a 5 star experience. It was pretty much a flawlessly pleasant experience and we will DEFINITELY be back for multiple visits! I just hope future visits are as good, they've set the bar pretty high for themselves. So, based on my experience, I have to give Red Robin.. 5 stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=80
Jenny D.,"Las Vegas, NV",881,393,2599,1.0,10/17/2015,"Nope. I'm pretty sure I will never eat at another Red Robin again.  Woke up Sunday morning hungover as a mo'fo. Actually, I was probably still drunk. But I wanted food and i wanted football.  Red Robin was suggested.  We sat in the bar where they had several tv's, even tho my game wasn't being televised. Damnit. It happens tho.  I immediately ordered a bloody mary. It was mediocre. Nothing to brag about.  I couldn't decide what to order. I opted for a chicken sammich. The California Chicken or something? Add jalapenos.  Friend ordered some type of bbq burger.  Mine came out and had huge slices of raw jalapeños on it. I don't even mind the fact that the jalapeños were raw, bring the heat! But they were sliced SO thick it just makes them NOT good. The chicken was nearly inedible as well. It tasted super fake and just gross.  Friend initially said the burger was good, but half way thru came to realize that it actually WASN'T.

The waiter was great, but the burgers took a really long time, and then they weren't very good at all! I ordered the Red's Double Tavern burger and the mushroom burger. Just two burgers and fries cost $24! I don't think I have ever eaten a drier burger in all my life!! Even when I dipped each bite in ranch, I had a really hard time choking half of it down. The other burger was just as hockey puck dry. I was truly disappointed,  since these burgers cost an arm and a leg, I thought they would at LEAST taste good.

You can obviously tell the difference in the two burgers based on size. I eat there all the time. When I told them to take it back, the manager came out and yelled at me in front of other people saying it is the royal burger, which it wasn't. When I tried to explain that I know the difference between the two, she began to immediately yell ""call the police."" I was so embarrassed, I wasn't yelling or causing a scene at all, and she yelled for her staff to call the police out loud so everyone could here.

From there things went down hill. We waited 10 minutes for our drinks, a half hour for our food, our drink refills came with our checks, never had a chance to order more fries, and all of our checks were wrong. In addition, we were there over an hour and a half!   I had their $7 Tavern burger and garlic parm fries.

Our party of 15 were crammed at a table meant for a smaller party and they told us that once the table next to us clears up, that the table would be combined. Unfortunately, they forgot about it and had another party sit there instead when there are other empty tables. Needless to say, our meal somewhat felt like eating in a crammed bus. Very up close and personal.  I think the drinks/shakes here are pretty good. I ordered the Hawaiian Hearttrob and enjoyed it. The fries are also decent. But I was really unimpressed by the rest. I ordered the Prime Rib Dip, which was on the dry side. The meat was dry and flavorless. The au jus lacked flavor. The salad and coleslaw were both not fresh.

Amanda B.,"Lancaster, CA",0,6,3,2.0,2/25/2016,"I am SO ANNOYED with this location's to-go service!  I am giving two stars because things I enjoy about this establishment are: 1) They've never gotten my order wrong and 2) The food has always been up to par and consistent with other locations.  HOWEVER, I call to place an order to go on a weekday, and they immediately put me on hold to transfer my call. Like, why does my call need to be transferred? Aren't most calls for to go orders? Why is there no designated person to answer the phone, ready to take orders? On top of that, I'm on hold for 6 MINUTES before I hang up and try again. My call gets answered in just two rings, and I get placed on hold again...FOR FOUR MORE MINUTES. That's when my husband and I decided to get dinner elsewhere. Obviously they don't want our money, they don't value our business.  Other times I've gotten through and placed an order successfully over the phone, I show up the 15-20 quoted minutes later to have to wait around the bar (once a whole 20 more minutes--yeah, my fries were soggy).  My take-out experiences with this place are just so bad that I am not sure it will even be an option for us anymore. It's not worth the battle. It makes me mad to get bad service, and then I don't even get the food I want out of it, because I can't justify sticking around for bad service--and they don't care. I could yell or speak with the manager or whatever, but then I just become ""that"" customer. I'd rather just vent with this review and encourage the staff to STEP THEIR GAME UP.  Please.

Well things have changed. The burgers are now mediocre and the presentation is lackluster. The ""bottomless"" fries are now served in a tiny tin cup thing that gives you 10 fries at most which means you eat them in the first two minutes, and that leads to the reason for my low 2 star review. Service is less than adequate. The company in trying to save money has increased their servers work load to the point of ridiculousness. If you have 3 people eating and everyone eats at a different pace that means the server will have to refill each persons side at least once, that's minimum of three refills per table and if the server has 5 tables that's 15 trips to the back to get just refills on sides, not to mention taking orders, running food, refilling drinks and any other responsibilities they may have.

This time our waitress brought them in normal soda glasses right away. Which we loved. Not only did we not have to keep bugging her for refills but she didn't have to keep running and getting them.

We just assumed that they would be bottomless just like the regular fries. However, when we got our refill on fries they were just normal fries.

Jenae C.,"Las Vegas, NV",77,30,5,1.0,8/13/2015,"Let me start by saying that I adore Red Robin and visit about once a month. I'm well-familiar with the food and service typical of Red Robin. My mother and I went on Sunday, after church. Our server was Bruce, who was very friendly, but extremely harried and forgetful; a lunch that should have taken less than an hour took us two whole hours!! That's Olive Garden slowness, not typical Red Robin speed. Our orders were simple: two burgers. Mine was fine, but mom ordered a chicken Whisky River BBQ and it was so salty that she had them remake it. That wasn't a huge issue, though. If you ever eat here, only eat with Bruce if you're not in a hurry - he was slow when refilling our drinks, we had to ask for boxes three times because he kept walking away and doing other sidework for his empty tables. I overheard how he forgot things for one of his other tables next to us. And while he was pleasant, he would essentially come by, set your food down, and rush off to do whatever else he was thinking about. Not a good Red Robin experience at all; probably my worst.

Overall it's still a reasonable spot to dine in. I would recommend coming here for lunch not dinner.  The food is average although the last time we came we enjoyed their parmesan fries so I ordered it again only to find out they changed the recipe it was better before. They also say us in the back which at the time obviously had 1 server assisting multiple guests. Almost a hour into our meal no refills and honestly it wasn't the servers fault he was slammed. I had to walk up to the front to get someone to help us.

Excellent service, quick refills on drinks and fries. Food was great. Burgers cooked correctly. I had the ""über burger "". What a meal. It's very messy but awesome burger. The brat tops is nicely.

Most places wouldn't offer that right before closing time.  Still ordered to go and the food was delicious!! For anyone who loves sweet potato fries, get them here and order the Chipotle sauce on the side to dip with.

I kid you not, after an hour of waiting for our food (thank God for Facebook time stamps on posts) our server came to the table and told us that our order was only showing 22 minutes on the ticket, and all of their managers were working in the kitchen.  As a former server, I wanted to give him he benefit of the doubt, after all it was busy and he and everyone else was obviously in the weeds too.  Two people from our party of 8 had to leave, so they obviously didn't get their food.   About 10 minutes later our food started showing up slowly.  My order in-particular came last.  I'm not upset that it took terribly long, I'm disappointed in how the management handled our experience. The server has no control how fast the kitchen turns tickets.  With that being said we saw 2 different managers who tried to be accommodating, however instead of asking if there was anything else we needed, I feel as though they should have comped the ENTIRE bill, not just 2 burgers.   Poor management style in my opinion.  Now don't think that we didn't take care of our server.  He still made 20% off of our table (before food was taken off, etc.) Bottom line, going to Red Robin?

My clam chowder was pretty tasty as well. Nothing gourmet obviously, but it quenched my soup craving for the evening and for that I was appreciative. My fella enjoyed his burger quite a bit as well. We're both big fans of the endless refills on steak fries available. Not that we took full advantage of that, but it's good in theory.Try the fries with some honey mustard. Yum!

Stan C.,"Henderson, NV",135,380,203,4.0,12/30/2014,"Ambience: There were six of us for dinner including two grandchildren ages 4 & 7. Showing up with 6 people for dinner at other restaurants has presented a major problem, not so at this Red Robin. Despite the fact that the restaurant was crowded with people waiting, after just 5 minutes they seated us at a round table that was an appropriate size for 6 people. We were far enough away from other tables that we didn't feel like we were bothering people at the next table with our children and the other tables were far enough away from us that their kids didn't bother us. The restaurant provided balloons and crayons and paper to draw on for the little ones. This is a major asset. Food: you don't come to Red Robin for gourmet food. You come for good food at fair prices. The children's menu is fairly extensive. And it is reasonably priced. We had one mac and cheese and 1 grilled cheese sandwich. I sampled each and both were really good. It came with sides that included a choice of a couple of fruits or vegetables or the omnipresent french fries. I had the Southwest grilled chicken salad. The salad was fresh, the chicken was tasty, and they had fried jalapeno that were surprisingly delicious. The portions were large so no one left hungry. Service: our waiter came to our table fairly rapidly after we sat down. He took our drink orders immediately. He came back for a food order in a timely fashion. He got everything right. Service with a smile. I especially liked that the restaurant manager was present throughout the meal and stopped by our table at least 2 times to make sure that everything was going well.

Doesn't get too busy and service is always good here.  Their burgers are good, juicy, and the thing that sets any burger here apart is based on what you put on it.  I forget all the different types of burgers you can get, but they make pretty much everything.  The turkey burger is also good.  I tried the Oktoberfest Burger and wasn't too impressed.  I should have stuck to what I usually get, which is their Tavern Double.  So good.   Other Try's: -Cod Sandwich.  Not bad, but Bachi's ruined it for them.  Haven't found anyone that has a better cod sandwhich than Bachi Burger. -Patty Melt:  Okay, but small.

Our waitress, Sonia, was dragging her feet the whole time! Never cleared the empty appetizer dishes from the table... I had to! Drink refills? Nope! Bottomless root-beer float? I got one refill that I had to stop the waitress and ask for. The fries were cold and stale. Like I mentioned, the worst service I've experienced!

Second time we have been here since the remodel, and AGAIN the menu has changed. The biggest change was the raise in prices. A $10 to $15 Hamburger is not a family friendly price. But I will admit my burger was tasty, but to call them gourmet because they have different con sauces and toppings is an understatement to charge so much.  Instead of fries I chose to substitute with a cup of French Onion soup which cost extra, that's fine, Surprise, they have new dishes, that include a small square shaped bowl that probably holds 3 ounces, but by the time they put in the bread, I may have had 2 Tsp. of broth,  My one daughter ordered a burger which she ate 1/2, saying it didn't have much flavor. The other daughter a pizza and my husband a soup and salad. No complaints.  Our server was very busy with large groups of tables but was still very attentive to us.  Here's the topper, they have an electronic pad on all the tables. It advertises specials, let's you pay your bill, or you can play games. My one daughter looked at it briefly to see what all the pad did. When we got the bill, there was a charge for an entertainment fee. When I questioned it our server said it was from playing the games. I thought for a moment because no one played a game. But my daughter did hit the click on the button here for games when she was looking at it. When I looked at the pad, I waited for the game screen to pop up, when it did in white lettering along a blue sky with white clouds reads that you will be charged.

It was packed but we were sat quickly. Looking around I should have known we were in for a helluva night since everywhere I looked there were snot nosed little monsters getting high on soda and shakes. One Little blonde girl started crying as we were sat and I felt sorry for the girl. That sorrow quickly turned to annoyance as the parental unit ignored the crying and it turned to ear shattering screams of pay attention to me!  The waitress saw us flinching and apologized for the noise and the long wait for our food saying it was busy tonight (37 minutes for our food and the musical accompaniment of that little blonde girl and her monster back up screamers). Food was normal Red Robin,  the manager came over and apologized for the screaming kids and took our drinks off our bill saying he wished parents had the sense to take their kids outside when they acted like that.

I am a huge fan of their onion ring tower, but by the time my hubby and I split one of those, we never have room for the burger and fries. I asked our server if it was possible to sub the small order of rings for the fries with our burgers. BTW, you can do that for a $1.49 charge. Totally worth it.  I ordered the whiskey river BBQ burger, medium, with the onion rings. Burger was cooked perfectly. Onion rings maybe could have been pulled about 15 seconds earlier. Not too big of a deal, just a smidge darker than usual, but certainly not burnt.  Our server, Tony, was awesome.

Justin G.,"Las Vegas, NV",584,256,234,2.0,12/11/2013,"I'm usually down for Red Robin as I love a good burger, but my recent visit to this location had me running for the door. Red Robin is great spot for some pretty decent burgers and chicken sandwiches. The bright colors and décor scream family friendly and they definitely go out of their way to please young children. (The TV in the floor is cool touch) On an average visit you will hear their rendition of the birthday song several times. Fortunately, there is a full bar and good happy hour for the grown-ups.  It had been a while since the last time I was here so I convinced some friends to check it out around lunch time. We were promptly seated by the host and greeted by our server, little did we know that this was going to be the last time we saw her. I decided to get my usual, the peppercorn burger and onion rings to share. After we made our selections, we waited for our server to return... and waited and waited and waited. About ~20minutes later one of the bussers came over looking confused and asked if someone had helped us. He acted like we had just taken menus from the front and just sat down randomly. Soon after a new server appeared, for whatever reason she seemed annoyed that we were there; as if we had done something wrong. For whatever reason our food came out in waves; after the onion rings I was the first to get my food. We were expecting the other two dishes to come our soon but they took almost 30 minutes. My friend who ordered the bruschetta chicken sandwich was brought out the fish and chips instead, I have no idea who they mixed that up. They brought out her correct order later but our other friend and I were long finished with our food. My request for an additional serving of the ""bottomless fries"" also seemed to have been quickly forgotten as well.  Not sure what we did to deserve the neglect but it sucked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=160
Andrew W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,2.0,11/1/2015,"Red Robin often bills itself as a family friendly restaurant, however this location is anything but. Specifically designed to partition families into a separate area of the restaurant, making it noisier louder and in general much poorer experience. Servers are more stressed, service is slower, equipment that has been pointed out before on previous visits has never been fixed (such as broken lights).  Find it a bit disrespectful to be segregated to a run-down corner of the restaurant just because we have children. We pay the same prices as everyone else, so I would expect the same courtesy and service. This establishment is not recommended if you have families. Other Red Robin locations in Las Vegas area are better suited, like the location at the Galleria mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=160

We were seated near a window and right away I noticed dried food on the window sill. Not a good sign. I ordered the fish and chips which, even though I wasn't hungry, I enjoyed and finished all of them. I also had to try a tasted on my girlfriends burger. That was okay I've had better.

We came in and instantly got greeted by our seater, I forgot what our servers name was but she was the best! Usually when I go to a Red Robin in a different location it takes forever for them to bring me what I need whether it be napkins, campfire or ranch sauce, or a refill on my bottomless lemonade! But I can't stress enough about how my server was on top of everything! I didn't need to ask for anything at all. She brought like 5 napkins right off the bat, the shortie rings with ranch and campfire sauce and then another ranch and campfire sauce when our burgers came. The thing I noticed the most though was when I ordered the strawberry lemonade it came in a curvy glass and when she brought me a refill without me asking it was in a huge glass! That's never happened before because at other locations I would just get a refill on the curvy glass but I wasn't complaining! ^-^ the manager even stopped by to ask us how we were doing and if she could get us anything and got us our 3rd refill! So basically, we will not only be coming here because it's the nearest one to us, but for the great service and all the kind employees!  + I recommend anyone who loves red robin as much as I do to get a red robin royalty card!

I used to come here years ago for garlic fries but it doesn't seem up to par this time. Granted, it's been a few years, or maybe they were kind of soggy or maybe the appetizers filled me up already. It just didn't taste quite the same. I split the burger (prime chophouse?) with my friend cause we can't finish one whole burger. To be honest, we didn't even finish our half burger nor our fries.

Ginny P.,"Henderson, NV",252,81,580,4.0,6/27/2013,"This Red Robin is 100x better than its sister restaurant at the Galleria Mall. It's like walking into a completely different restaurant, it's just decorated the same.  We visited on a Saturday night and got seated at the bar right away. I initially thought ""here we go...the bartender is also our server and he's going to forget about us"". Boy was I wrong. Our server came over right away and took our drink order. We weren't quite sure what we wanted for dinner yet so we started with the jalapeno coins and some french fries & ranch (their ranch is seriously like crack. I love it here. It's creaminess and consistency set it out from the rest). Our server accommodated us and got us our apps hot & fresh right away! P.S. their strawberry lemonade is heavenly, has fresh strawberries floating in it and has unlimited refills. YES! I did notice that Red Robin had a newer menu. It's more condensed and organized, which I found helpful, as their last one was like a bible. So thick and took forever to get through. My fiancé chose the Royal Red Robin Burger which is like breakfast on a bun - meat, cheese, an over easy egg, bacon, mayo and garden. I chose the Crispy Chicken Burger - just chicken and cheese only. When our food came out we were excited to see our fries presently beautifully in a little medal cylinder. It made it look like a fancy dish....not just scattered amongst the plate. My fiancé's burger was cooked perfect and he enjoyed it (more like inhaled it! lol). My chicken sandwich came out with black bubbles of cheese and was burnt :( The bartender took control of the situation and got me a fresh one right away. It was juicy, tender and flavorful the second time around so I was a happy camper. My fiancé really enjoyed the spicy dipping sauce that came with the jalapeno coins. He kept dipping his burger in it and asking for more :D  For dessert we ordered the Mud Pie. It was delicious, tasty and they put extra hot fudge in the dish for me. YAY! The cookie crumb crust was delightful!

Hubs and I went with a bacony burger on special for $7.  He ordered more fries but never got them - good thing - 1 burger and fries is plenty.  Additional fries would have caused pain.   It's relatively cheap and it will definitely fill your belly.  Great place for kids.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=180

I don't usually come here during Happy Hour but when I do, I switch out the lemonade for the beer!  I haven't had bad service here yet and they're pretty quick, even when I was with a party of 10. All of us ended up getting freckeled lemonade and we cleaned them out of glassware! Didn't know that was possible, we were quite entertained by it.

This is burger heaven, and I love the fact that you can substitute the typical red meat patty for a Boca or Gardenburger patty if you're vegetarian like I am. This past visit was pretty decent. The server we had was very attentive and friendly and the food was right on par. Only downside is that our server forgot to ask if we would like fries while we waited on our lunch. I didn't bother to ask because they typically ask or just automatically bring them to you. So we waited for ten minutes until our lunch arrived and once it did, they brought my mom fruit instead of fries as her side. So then I asked for a basket of fries. Mom ordered the Simple Burger and it didn't come with cheese. Neither of us noticed that it didn't from the menu, so we had to ask for a slice of cheese on the side.  At the end of the day, the food was great and the fries are always great. Only downfall is that we were both starving and didn't get the bottomless fries treatment. All in all, I'll be back in some fashion, whether it be with coworkers, mom or friends.

Then when I ordered the drinks and appitizer it took at least 15 minutes then I noticed that the sauce for the pretzels there was very little and when I showed her Rachel said ""oh but we will have to charge .25 cents"" so I said no thank you!! If you would of made sure that it was filled in the first case then I wouldn't have to pay...here's the best...my our drinking glasses had lipstick on the rims!!!!

Upon entering, met by a snarky host- seats us by the bathrooms, after we clearly requested not to be. Place wasn't even half full, and there was a table, (clean) further away. Requested that table, he mistook one that was dirty and immediately replied ""I am not cleaning that table for you"" and walked away. Next, ordered spinach dip without onions. MANAGER delivered them to the table. Pointed out to her dip was ordered without onions. She asked if it was because of allergies, we responded no, just don't want onions. She gave us a nasty look and said ""Fine, we will fix it""- when she returned with it, they had scooped out the center of the dip, covered it with a tiny bit of cheese and slammed it down on the table. Mind you we are in los of the kitchen.... so we saw it in action. Our food order sat in window for ten minutes, waiter and manager were giggling about it sitting there. Finally one waitress overheard our comment re be nice to get our order... brought it out, food quality was HORRIBLE. Chicken was old and rubbery- nasty. So, they get a star, not because they earned it, but because I can't  choose lesser value. Kenny- get it together, manager- take a nap or something- you are not a good example of quality service. It is no wonder why your staff are as poorly responsive as you are. Never again- matter of fact- considering call to corporate- so many more nasty little occurances, too numerous to list here.

The food runner came and was very nice but we were not checked on for at least 15 minutes. As a waiter myself, I would get an ass chewing for doing so. Meanwhile she continued to serve everyone around us, while having a smile on her face. Everyone except for us. After another 15 minutes of waiting she came over to see if we were ready to pay. I informed her of the charged drinks, she fixed it, then slammed the computer thing in front of me. At this point I'm pretty pissed off. I honestly contemplated leaving the restaurant without paying. Sadly I don't remember her name because I would've put her on blast on here. I find it shitty because I frequent this restaurant and always get really great service. Just not this time.

FOURTY-FIVE minutes later we got our food. We have already been here for an hour. Why on earth could it possibly take this long for 4 burgers and fries? None of our drinks were refilled. Ever. The manager brought us our food and my husband asked him to bring a new drink and refill our sons drink, I also asked him for the two sides of honey mustard we were missing. He proceeded to tell me we were asking for to much. Sorry sir, but if my waitress ever came by I'd ask her instead. Waited Almost ten minutes for honey mustard, which was brought by two members of the kitchen staff... Not sure what that was all about.  My burger was sooooo greasy that within two minutes the bun was a soggy disaster. The burger was falling apart faster than I could eat it, and the bun had turned completely to mush.  Fries and especially their honey mustard, great as always. So I guess the two stars are for the honey mustard if I'm being honest. We sat there as our two year olds who had finally had enough started getting antsy and knocking everything to the floor. It was probably 15 minutes before we were actually done eating before we saw our server again, in which she dropped off the check and walked off. Had to hunt her down to actually get her to run the card so we could leave. Awful awful customer service.

It's just like movie theaters, they have all the same movies and expensive prices for snacks. The difference that separates each chain restaurant is the service and etc. This Red Robin's service is inconsistent. Though our servers are always nice, I remember one in particular who just showed no personality or emotions. I felt like I was talking to a wall. She made me feel that I shouldn't even be there and that she shouldn't be there. Otherwise, most servers are courteous. The only issue I have is their inconsistency. They're not as timely as other Red Robins but I would actually blame the fact that there aren't enough waitresses. When I was there, I would only see 3 maybe 4 at most servers working.

The broth was just a bit on the greasy side but that's probably where a lot of the incredible flavor comes from.  The onions floating in the soup were cooked just a bit more than crisp-tender so they weren't soggy and slimy but rather kept their form and texture without that raw onion bite I detest so much. The soup came with pita bread doused in garlic and cheese sprinkles.  Yum, my tummy was not just satisfied but ecstatic and (in case you wonder) the soup stayed exactly where it was meant to stay, in my stomach... my apologies if you're eating a meal whilst reading this and have a vivid imagination...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=200

My wife was craving a loaded cheeseburger so along with my 2 year old off we went. Being a Friday night the parking lot was almost full, my wife and I took the last two open spaces as she met us there. Once we stepped inside things went South. Rather than write war and peace let's just drop the facts:  1: They called that iced tea?  2: You quit carrying spinach and artichoke dip? WTF?  3: The Mushrooms / Zucchini appetizer picture had to be Photoshopped. What we got, well the mushrooms were edible. The zucchini was, well, ugh! 4: Normally the Fish and Chips are good. I've had them in Kansas City, Denver, and Vegas. Tonight's batch failed. Blah, boring, undercooked. Why mince words, it sucked.  5: I asked for malt vinegar sauce. 3 requests later someone finally gets it.  6: I would like my steak fries to be warm, preferably when they come to the table I want them hot enough when served that I don't want to keep my fingers on them for long. What I got made me wonder if the cook was celebrating 4/20 prior to coming to work.  7: 1.19 for two lame little bitty slices of avacado that looked like it was on it's last legs? Really? Pathetic.  8: My 2 year old thought the mac and cheese sucked. He ate two bites, thankfully the orange they served with it was good as that's all he ate. And it's hard to make kids food suck but they rose to the occasion.  9: On the way out we had to walk past a bunch of servers and a manager who wouldn't clear a path and they were talking about a large party that came in. The manager said and I quote ""I don't know where in the f*** to sit them, either they wait or they can sit on the damn floor"".  Needless to say I was happy to leave. Thankfully the Cupcakery that shares the same parking lot was still open to provide some sustenance that actually tasted good.   On my way home the way my stomach feels it made me wonder if I might need some Syrup of Ipecac before the night's over.  2 Stars: Our server was overworked but tried his best.

Retired L.,"Henderson, NV",0,12,,1.0,11/14/2014,"We ordered the Bottomless Root Beer Float and a burger with so-called endless fries - GUESS AGAIN.  After one root beer float, they suddenly had no more of the featured mugs they advertise that they come in and shifted to a small glass at least 1/2 the size. The restaurant was half full at 8 PM on a weekday, and they claimed they ran out of glassware, hmmmmm. The endless fries got one refill for two of us, and then the wait staff just disappeared.  When we finally cornered our waitress and asked for another refill, she said she would take care of it, and after a long 15 minutes we got our last refills. If they advertise something, they should serve it. As a former pro football player, I do have an appetite, but to have deceptive service of avoiding refills we will NEVER go to Red Robin again.

His welcoming was not robotic and for the 1 minute he spent with us... we knew the restaurant was well managed. He also made sure we had a booth that we requested so extra plus for that. Momentarily we were greeted by Katy, our server for the evening. She is.... so.... good. She's happy, and you can genuinely tell. What impressed me the most though is how the colleagues interacted with one another. They tell each other Thank you and excuse me. Without a good team environment, you can't offer great service- they've obviously nailed both down. We came at a busy night.... sat down for about an hour and there were 4 birthdays around the restaurant. Came during Tuesday night 6-7. ( I really hope my server name is Katy lol... If not she is the blond, thin, tall, and nice of course!) 4.5 for food: I ordered the A1 peppercorn burger, as I love A1 sauce. The flavors are definitely there. My friend ordered the whiskey river bbq burger... now that's one delicious burger. it's worth the calories, take my word! Only order that if you love bbq sauce just an fyi. I ordered the sweet potatoe fries for an additional cost and that was very good too. Only reason why I gave -.5 I request for medium rare... meat was completely cooked through. Maybe cause the patty is quite thin or while it was sitting on the warmer plate it may have cooked on its own. This is my first Yelp review I am writing so thank you red robins for a great dinner.

It was a busy night and I understand that, but we had to wait 10 minutes for our waiter to even approach our table for our drink order. Not to mention the random stop he made at our table, barely acknowledging us, because he mixed up another tables receipt in the ziosk . When he got to our table he was rushing us through our order and when we finally got our food one of the orders were wrong. So we had to wait again for the correct plate to arrive. Half way through our dinner we were all out of drinks and we tried using their new ""Ziosk"" to order drinks, which personally I don't think is the way we should have to order our drinks, but the option wasn't even available so we sat waiting. While we were waiting for drinks the waiter told us his ""trainee"" would be getting our drinks. That is so unprofessional, calling her a partner or letting us know someone was helping him out wouldve been more respectful in my opinion.

Adina C.,"Las Vegas, NV",236,121,17,2.0,8/1/2011,"Came here tonight and it was the epitome of ""Meh, I've experienced better"" which is why I am rating it as such. We also came here before grocery shopping as I make note not to shop on an empty stomach after my $150 Whole Foods extravaganza of 2010, and because I was lazy due to not being able to cook with no food, thus we came here. I wish I would  have known what was coming or else I would have taken the effort to make a much more satisfying meal at home.  As a vegan, there are very few things I can order and I do not think my order is too complicated in the least, but our waitress just did not get it right. In fact our waitress is the reason why this visit was especially horrid. We had to ask for EVERYTHING, while waiting forever to ask it as she disappeared at full-on ninja status most of the evening. We had to ask for silverware, ketchup, refills; the works. The burger I had did not come out with how I ordered it, and when they did get it right it was just - bland. I know that they microwaved my Boca patty which is fine, but I felt like they microwaved the mushrooms I had on top as well. They were supposed to be sautéed! It was not a satisfying meal, and we were also there for an hour and a half. A meal like that should not have taken so long, but our waitress was nowhere to be found for a majority of it.  The service and quality is usually decent, but tonight it was horrific. It really makes me not want to go back anytime soon. Next time I will break my rule and shop first, cook later. The headache from this visit was not worth the effort I would have put into a much tastier meal at home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=220

Me: Alright Per the kids' request, we visit Red Robin every one to two months. They like it because of the miniature arcade in the front, balloons, crayons, and kid's menu/coloring page/activities. I like it because it is always super loud so no one can hear when my 1 year old gets fussy or when my 4 year old isn't using his inside voice. All of the craziness at my table blends in with the ruckus of the remaining restaurant into one big, happy, burger-eating union. I'm sure you know that they give you unlimited steak fries, but did you know that for $0.99 extra, they will turn those into Garlic Parmesan fries? I'm quite certain they use garlic out of a pre-minced jar and pre-shredded parmesan, but they are still delicious. Make sure to ask for their ranch, which is scrumptious, and the perfect pairing for their fries.  My husband and I usually share the guacamole bacon burger which is a decent burger. I honestly can't say it's much better than the one from Carl's Jr. but we're paying for the atmosphere and bottomless fries. Our bill usually comes to around $20 for an appetizer, burger, and kid's meal. For a family of 4, I think this is a bargain.

Jessie B.,"Henderson, NV",75,776,124,3.0,8/2/2010,"I had lunch here last week with 3 coworkers. If I had dined alone, I would be giving Red Robin 4, perhaps even 5 stars, as my experience was great. Sadly two of the three people I was with had issues with their food though, so I am giving this Red Robin experience a 3. We started out lunch with a basket of fries. Red Robin has delicious steak cut fries which they will give you unlimited refills on. It's pretty much impossible to leave Red Robin hungry because you can always fill up on the tasty fries.  I had the soup and sandwich combo which was a BLTA sandwich and a bowl of clam chowder. One of my coworkers ordered a turkey burger. Another ordered the crispy chicken tender salad, and the third ordered red's rice bowl.  My order came out fine, as did the crispy chicken tender salad. (The salad looked amazing, I will probably order it the next time I go) The turkey burger came out as directed but it was under cooked. The person that ordered the rice bowl ended up with a chicken salad.  Our server did a good job of rectifying our issues, but I still have to base my review on everything that happened. I have had many good experiences with other Red Robin locations over the years, because of that and the fact that our server fixed our problems I will certainly go back and give this location another try in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=260

Tonight I discovered the drastic change in portion as well as the increase in price. Red Robin is NOT gormet.  It is a American burger place known for fries, shakes, and burgers. They should not charge higher pricing and give their customers bearly half of what used to be given.

That was about the worst thing that happened the entire night. Now for the good stuff. They have a bottomless root beer float. Yes you read it right, free refills on a root beer float. That made my night over the top. It was a good float too not made with cheap ice cream and crappy soda. The food came out really quick and was prepared well. Everything was put together in a really nice presentation. Plus they can sing a mean happy birthday here :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=240

I ordered the mushroom burger and not only does it look absolutely gross, the bun was very soggy and mushy. The food prep put tons of mushrooms which spilled all over my plate and the oils have soaked up the buns. It was very difficult to eat. I also ordered a strawberry milkshake that was about $5.00.

Thomas B.,"Las Vegas, NV",104,8,,1.0,6/12/2015,"If I could rank this place a zero I would. But not for food or management. The food is always great. It is a zero for customer service. Now, I go to many other red robins. I usually order a chicken sandwhich without the bun to keep it on the healthy side. But what I really want is the bottomless fries. So four or five months ago I go to this location and ordered my drinks. I then asked if I could get some fries to start as they are bottomless. I was told no they dont do that. I had been to that location many times. That was the FIRST time i was ever told no when asking that. Usually I also tip 20%...actually always. After leaving there, i felt ashamed because i didnt leave a 20% tip for the first time ever. Now today, after going to many other red robins and even that same one, I get the same waitress. My mind was made up; If she told me no fries to start I was leaving. Sure enough, nope can have fries. I immediately said ok we are leaving ( i was with two others). The manager rushed over to correct the situation. He told me that she meant to say that it will be a bit, not no we cant. So either one of them was lying. I dont deal with horrible customer service.

I sat at the bar which is within the smallest section of the restaurant and counted 4 tables that were empty but still had the dirty dishes on them.

David S.,"Las Vegas, NV",570,1050,274,4.0,4/3/2011,"There must have been a time when you have felt ravenous and want to devour everything within sight. Red Robin is the epitome of this desire. With their ginormous burgers and bottomless baskets of fries, you will feel satisfied and ready for the self hatred that comes with it.  Walking past the first set of double doors, you will be greeted with a warm welcome and open second set of double doors. The hostess inquire about your day and lead you to your table. The interior is strictly classic American. It does not pretend to be a 50's diner, but gives you the feel of what I guess our country use to be.  The food is over abundant and fast. I normally prefer the whiskey river BBQ burger on a whole wheat bun. When I substitute the meat patty for a boca burger, I am still not disappointed. The last time I ordered their new menu item, the chophouse burger. It is delicious, but I felt my arteries clogging up. Overall, I enjoyed it, but do not remember everything that was on it besides the onion straws and the horseradish mayo. I think there was some sauteed mushrooms as well. It was tasty, but I would order my usual. There are so many different tiers in the Vegas burger world. For being a family establishment that is unassuming and basic, I enjoy this for when I want something simple or classic.

($9.99)  Entrees came in a timely manner.  Fries are good steak fries with seasoned salt on the table and a number of dipping sauces available.  I got my fries with the mayo/mustard sauce called campfire.  I should say I ordered my fries with it because when the fries arrived the sauce did not come with it.  By the time the sauce arrived the fries and wich were long gone.  I did use them on my second order of fries which came a good 10-15 minutes later.  Iced tea came pretty regularly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=240

And I want to say I do miss the Red Robin on Decatur.  I do not get to RR as much as I would have liked because they are all a distance from me anymore. So when I go to Doctor on that side of town I try to get there. Only once about 10 years ago I had a bad experience with them and up until yesterday they have always been the greatest in every way, Walked before 4pm, was mostly deserted. A first for anytime I have been to any RR. We were seated and then had to wait a bit before we were asked what we would like to drink, me? Iced tea, my guest coffee.My tea cam and it looked like a drop of color was added to water. NO TEA. So called server and he said he would get some from another station which was not really much better. Should have just had water. My guest was still waiting for his coffee. We had decided what we were going to have, mine always the Seafood Scatter. My guest chose a burger, Finally his coffee came. Long wait and we were finally served. My guest, his burger he said was good, We needed more napkins  and finally got a bus boy to get us some.My shrimp and clam strips were good but when I bit into the cod it was like a piece of gristle, The cod pieces were VERY small any way. I had fished a good part of my life off the CA coast for every cod imaginable and this was truly BLAH. Fries were not many and at no time were we asked if we wanted more fries. That has never happened before. Nor were we asked for or got a refill on coffee or tea. Almost 3$ for a drink of watered tea. By that time I was to tired and not happy and did not want to create a scene even tho there were not many to hear me if I did. The server put the bill on the table. I asked for a to go box and most of the time when the servers see there are NO MORE fries they will add a few. But not the time. There fries are excellent if you can get any.  Well I got the bill ready and waited and waited and again flagged a bus boy and asked for out server. He came and we paid the bill. Took the teeny pieces of cod with NO fires home. Normally I will snack on my doggie bag in the evening, Got the teeny piece and a half home and a couple hours later decided to have it. The cod was tough!!!!!!!!! First time in my life I have had tough cod and I am 78 years old and fished for years. Was barely a bite in the  piece to just tossed in garbage disposal.  Extremely disappointed and will not go back and I cannot count the times I have been to Red Robins and in the past so looked forward to the seafood platter, Should have turned into In'N""Out just down the street.

He was very polite, asked us how we were and how many were in the party. When we told him the number, he said politely ""give me just a few moments while we set something up for."" He was super energetic and I could clearly tell he loved being there. When he walked up, we had a manager come over to ask if we had been helped, we said yes. I think he said his name was Matt. Plain blue shirt and no name tag. He started talking to us and I'm sorry but he was VERY arrogant. He kept on making the same jokes over and over. We laughed it off, but I was unimpressed. Our host Michael came back and said I have it all set up for you and I take you back now with a smile. We gathered the troops and headed back. He politely waited for us all to take a seat (and we we're long lol) but he had a good spirit and laughed with us as we tried to find our positions. Kameya was our server. And she was WONDERFUL! Very joyful and helpful. As we got our appetizers, Matt came back around to (again, sorry to say, BOTHER US!) He repeated the same jokes again. And I kept thinking, does he not remember us from 10 minutes ago!!! He stood there for about 10 minutes continuing to talk and I just grew tiresome.

I have never been to any restaurant that I've had a manager come over and give up a 15 comedy sketch of unfunny jokes. It was just restless and annoying. Thanks RED ROBIN, but we're all consider a different location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=300
Michael P.,"Las Vegas, NV",185,342,143,3.0,1/20/2010,Red Robin has a classic diner image in both the food and the restaurant decor itself. The are a fusion of old diner style burgers and shakes with a TGIF/Applebees blend of modern comfort items. The even change up their burgers from time to time and theme them up like the 5' alarm burger.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=300
Ronald P.,"Las Vegas, NV",27,44,,2.0,3/26/2011,"As a hunter for the perfect burger, and a 20 year cook, I have already realized that perfection is in the mouth of the beholder, and you really have to share the taste of chef who developed the combination in question. Today, I had the chophouse burger. It was different than most burgers I had tried, but well prepared and refreshing. I may even opt to have it again, so long as I am seated and tended to by a food server.      I have gathered that food service from 2000 to present has become disgraceful (compared to that of pre-2000) so I don't set my expectations too high when I dine out.      But eating at the bar was nothing short of piss-poor. I have queried 3 different employees on information of the a couple of menu items- 2 of which admitted that they were in the gray and my server- the bartender- said she would find out. It took her 12 minutes to retrieve that information. I had already finished one glass of water which was placed under a dusty tapper, which I wiped off myself (witnessed by another employee) before my order could finally be taken and sent back to the cook. I can understand her distress as she had to tend to 2 others who were sitting at the bar and keep up with after-work plans with her co-workers (said sarcastically.)       Before I finished my only round of fries (if I had been seated, I would have been offered a refill), I added an entree to go. Just a bit over five minutes later, she returns with my order, already bagged, and to any one else with a 5th grade education would have recognized that I had no other business but to pay for my food. She placed my order beside my two empty beverage containers and continued doing what she was doing- not wiping down service areas and gossiping with her cohort. Another 10 minutes had passed when she finally asked if I wanted to pay my bill. Duh! I would've waved her down for the bill, but I wanted to be able to justify her $1.16 tip, far more than she deserved.   I would have liked to hear her complain of the sickly gratuity, but I had already spent 1hr and 3 minutes for business that could have been resolved in 25 generous minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=300
Aaron F.,"San Francisco, CA",8,25,1,3.0,7/27/2009,"I simply love burgers and love trying every burger that anyone has to offer.  Something new that I found here that nowhere else had was the Bleu Cheese burger.  The burger was good, not great.  The meat was salty, partly due to the bleu cheese, but that comes with the territory.  I don't blame them for trying.  Also, pay attention to the bread that your burger will be served on, as I got a jalapeno loaf, that was okay but dry compared to my girlfriend's normal sesame seed bun.   They have bottomless steak-cut fries, which I don't think too many people take up the bottomless offer.  Just think about large, unseasoned potato wedges.  But they do have their own seasoning on all the tables. The staff are very friendly and service is excellent.  They refill your drinks with brand new ones when they see yours get down to half or less, at least our waiter did.  Also, very fun for birthdays as they sing and encourage the other patrons to join in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=300
Ameeluz C.,"Las Vegas, NV",62,11,3,2.0,8/27/2012,"only two stars cuz the food tasted good. i had the bonzai, which is ok. i think the carls jr. teriyaki burger tastes better though. my bf got a royal red robin and it was ok for him too. we also had some coleslaw and mac n' cheese but they never brought out napkins and utensils. we asked for some and we got napkins but the guy said the utensils were being washed. we thought that was weird but w/e. halfway through our meal and we still didnt get it. when we finished, we sat around for probably 10 minutes before we were noticed. they gave us to go boxes for our stuff and asked if we needed our check but we waited another while before we got it... maybe the staff has memory issues or something... our server came by and asked us how we were doing and i mentioned that we never got our utensils so she apologized and told her manager. the manager ended up comping the whole meal so we didn't have to pay at all. i'd prolly go to red robin again, just not this location...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=300
John L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,32,,2.0,2/21/2011,I always had a good experience at RR with their hamburgers but last night me and my wife decided on their pasta and chicken. Well what a nightmare... We were seated next to the kitchen and could see everything. The cooks were all Mexican guys and couldn't speak English and didn't understand the waiters and couldn't read the order tickets. Just getting the order in took 10 minutes. We saw the pasta coming out of a microwave and they messed it all up and had to remake it. By the time it got to us 35 minites had passed. The food was ice cold and tasted horrible. We walked out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=300
Matt K.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,18,,4.0,3/22/2010,"What a difference location makes. Notice this Red Robin has a higher rating than the others. They are flexible with menu changes or substituions (which I often ask for). The food is tasty, portions gererous, servers friendly & the prices reasonable. It's kid friendly, so for my tastes it's a bit noisy, but that's alright. They are worth driving out of your way for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=300
