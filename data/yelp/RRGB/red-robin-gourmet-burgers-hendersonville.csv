Christeana H.,"Sparks, NV",42,61,64,5.0,11/4/2017,Great food.  But got it took along time to get our food.  A table got their food before us and we order before them.  We only had 3 ppl and they had 4.  The appetizer that we got was burnt.  The waitor was nice but when we asked why they got there food first he couldnt tell us why.  He got a manager.  Needless to say we got our meal paid for.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hendersonville
Brittany F.,"Nashville, TN",129,235,79,2.0,8/24/2017,"Hmmm....Red Robin...I don't get your slogan...Red Robin - Yum, more like Red Robin - yuck or meh or no thanks, really anything but yum. The Nashville area is filled with burger places, like you can't go a mile without hitting a burger place and Red Robin doesn't even compare to any of those places, even the overrated ones.  I ordered a chicken caesar wrap because I wasn't feeling a burger when my family decided to go there. The server was really nice and brought out some fries before the meal because we had several kids at the table. Those fries, I get that they are bottomless but why would you want a lot of those things? The fries were limp and fat and had zero seasoning, I added some of the seasoning from the table plus ketchup and they still weren't worth eating. Seriously, why waste the calories on those things! Then the food came out and my caesar wrap was pretty gross. The chicken is that refrigerated, slimy prepackaged chicken, not even a little fresh and if I'm wrong on that then however they are storing it makes it slimy. I ended up picking most of the chicken out of the wrap so that left lettuce, some parmesan and tomatoes and a butt ton of caesar dressing, which isn't very good.  There was one bright spot in the whole experience and that is that one of the kids in our family has a lot of allergies and the server took all of his requests like a champion, she did a good job dealing with our group!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hendersonville
D. H.,"Hendersonville, TN",17,258,192,2.0,1/3/2018,"Okay, I don't know--I recently gave 4 stars to the Red Robin location in Nashville and here a couple months later I'm going for 2 for this one. Red Robin is a generally a guilty pleasure meal for my wife and I and for what they do I'm usually a big fan--bottomless fries, great burgers, fattening milkshakes (with or w/o booze), good desserts, decent beer choices. However our recent visit here was a bit of a disappointment. The service was friendly and my burger was pretty good (though not the best I've ever had at RR, good nonetheless). The onion ring appetizer was a let-down: the onions tasted old and at first bite slid completely out of the batter. We requested fries to munch on while we waited on our food ('cuz if you're going to pack in the calories before those NY resolutions and you're at Red Robin might as well take advantage of those bottomless fries) but were told they were no longer allowed to bring fries before the meal. I mean, isn't that kind of their thing? To give you all the fires you want? We literally just had pre-dinner fries at the Nashville location 3 months ago. My wife was pretty disappointed in her fish and chips in that the fish was soggy, the batter was mediocre, and the flavor was bland. She said she took some responsibility for that one by ordering something outside of what the place is famous for (never order chicken at a steakhouse rule, right?) but if it's on the menu make it worthwhile or remove it from the menu. Lastly, the dessert really bummed us out. We ordered the sampler and while the chocolate truffle stick things and doughnuts were good, the sundae was atrocious (frostbitten, icy, missing whip cream, cherry AND chocolate syrup---it was just bad ice cream on top of hammered oreos): for $9 that was a misfire. Maybe it was an off night, it was closing in on the Christmas holiday but after dropping $60 on a meal and only really digging the burger and the beer we will be giving RR (at least this location) a break for some time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hendersonville
Ashley P.,"Nashville, TN",31,75,39,3.0,10/1/2016,I wanted another burger and the food was so good last time I came back here. I sat at the bar and I was the only one at the bar.  There were two bartenders and one was constantly complaining. It was her knee hurts and she wants to leave and if she couldn't leave they shouldn't expect her to work tomorrow. I was shocked at how much she didn't want to be there. Her name tag said Julie and I almost wanted to tell Julie that maybe if she was hurting so bad she shouldn't have a job she had to be on her feet all day. I do understand people who have pain because I also have pain but work is not the time nor the place especially when you work in customer service!  I really wanted to have a couple beers to relax but I ended up only having one because I was pretty disgusted after I finished my meal. I gave three stars because the cooks do a phenomenal job!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hendersonville
Silas A.,"Hendersonville, TN",3,16,5,3.0,9/11/2017,"Ordered to go for myself, my wife and two friends about a week ago. The food was packaged very well and the burgers were great, Mac n cheese very good. One of the burgers was for a Birthday girl and her toppings were all wrong but burger correct, she was ver disappointed that the request she submitted on website order did not happen. Also my wife added ""avocado"" on her Bonzai Burger for an additional 1.50 and when she got her burger there was barely two thin very small slices of avocado. Rip off. Otherwise everything else was great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hendersonville
Sarah R.,"Columbus, OH",189,15,1,1.0,3/21/2017,"If you look at my track record I've only ever given one negative review. Sadly, today will be my 2nd ever. My husband and I went to this Red Robin (I was starving and pregnant so it's not hard to please me these days if you just give me food haha.)  Pros: 1. We're seated immediately because they were dead 2. It was clean and the atmosphere was nice 3. Our server was nice and apologized a lot for mistakes that the kitchen made. That he might have made too not sure. Maybe he was new.  CONS: 1. I ordered the soup and salad combo and received ice cold French onion and a huge Caesar salad with chicken when I just ordered a side Caesar no chicken.  2. I was charged separately for the soup and salad instead of a combo which cost more. 3. My husband ate all of his fries before he received the sauce he was supposed to get with his burger and we almost took it home to go so he could have some A1. 4. I asked for the check and a Diet Coke to go. Never got it.  5. I asked for butter to go with a side of broccoli and was told they don't cook with it? Not sure if that was true or not or if the server didn't know. Normally I complain and would ask for my soup to be warmed up or at least fix the overcharge but I just wanted to go home as soon as possible.  I feel bad that we had such a bad time but it is what it is.... :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hendersonville
Nina N.,"Hendersonville, TN",7,18,,3.0,4/22/2017,I like that some of the burgers are 6.99 instead of all being 10.00. Of course the chubby fries are bottomless. And they have huge salads. I bought 2 appetizers and left with a carryout box  two of the orders were messed up at our big table one burger was served cold and the other had some ingred and the bread wrong. The avocado slices were dark and gross.   the place was absolutely packed.  Had to be assertive about what was wrong. Ranch dressing is delicious. Tastes homemade. Everybody loved their shakes. 3 people had a bill each over 13.00. The 3 dollar wedge salad with blue cheese is adorable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hendersonville
Keith S.,"Hendersonville, TN",22,27,13,4.0,9/2/2017,"Nice burgers and some good chicken sandwichs. All you can eat fries. The service is good. Nice selection of beers. Sometimes they have the ""Bees Knees"" which is a take on chicken and waffles - it's a waffle sandwich that has honey and some good heat with a jalapeno relish.  Nice staff",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hendersonville
Jenna M.,"Hendersonville, TN",0,3,,1.0,11/9/2017,"Waited 30 minutes to be seated . Tables were beyond messy after a party and nobody cleaned the tables for a good half hour . Ordered food and root beer floats . Got voodoo fries and chicken strips . The fries were cold and just yuk . I was hungry so I ate them . Parts were hard in the fries like freezer burned. The waiter was excellent but about 20 minutes after an expensive no so great meal ? Both my husband and I got severely ill . This is going on to day two of horrendous stomach issues . Food poisoning 1,000% . Never eating there again ! A 40$ meal isn't worth a lifetime supply of sickness .

Bianca B.,"Nashville, TN",170,238,1391,4.0,4/22/2017,Really cant go wrong with Red Robin. Ethan was our waiter and he's the nicest guy.  People like him  just makes your eating experience so muchh better,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hendersonville
Rosalee L.,"Clarksville, TN",3,3,2,4.0,4/20/2017,"This is my first time at this particular Red Robin location. My family and I stopped in for a quick bite to eat for lunch. We had a positive experience from start to finish. Our waiter Kenny, is the equivalent to a burst of sunshine!  He is so down to earth and a great asset to his workplace, in my opinion. We ordered the Smoke house Jack Tavern Double burger with the bottomless steak fries. We had an accompaniment of the house made hot sauce and Honey mustard sauce. They are awesome. We also tried the Campfire bbq sauce. Everything was hot and delicious! I look forward to visiting when I'm up in Hendersonville, again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hendersonville
Doris B.,"Hermitage, TN",0,16,,2.0,3/10/2017,"I've been a fan of Red Robin for a long time, and was excited to find this near me.  Over the past 3 years, we have been a frequent visitor, with up to 5 people in our group. However, there is limited seating for larger groups, which means a longer wait. Therefore, we have not been coming in as often. The last visit was the worst!  As I stood waiting for 45 minutes for a table in a half empty restaurant, I watched as the seater put people close together 'to make it easier for the server' who then had to reach across one table to grab the used glasses or other items from the next table. Really? I struck up a conversation with the greeter, who promised we were next as soon as a big enough table freed up. Then, the seater tried to move someone else in front of us. She argued with us and with the greeter, saying our name was no longer on the list and we would have to wait. I argued back, and she rudely seated us.  The table was in a corner in the ""family area"" (as opposed to the ""bar area"" where there were children who looked to be 5 or under), and like all the other corner booths, has very little space between the table and the wall, so if fits most children just fine, as well as skinny adults, but larger people have a tight fit. We eventually got a server, Amy, who was very nice if a bit overworked. She tried to hustle and get our food and drinks to us, but the kitchen was slow. The food: we got extra fries, but I'm not sure they counted as extra, as the first set were inedible. My burger was burned. There were only 5 pieces of fresh jalapeno and 2 pieces of fried jalapeno on my ""Burnin Love"" burger. The burger itself was okay - edible but not all that tasty. The tea was good. My daughter had to ask multiple times for a refill for her float, and Amy was able to get one from the bar after several attempts. Overall, the fact we had to wait so long to be seated in this place, the rudeness of the person seating people, the way people are crammed as close together as possible, and the mediocre food make this a place I will wait a long long long while before returning to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hendersonville
Tammy L.,"Hendersonville, TN",0,34,,3.0,11/13/2016,"Enjoyed the food, service was good, I just wish they would sit the kids all on one side so the people without kids can enjoy their meal without hearscreaming kids.

Richard A.,"Hendersonville, TN",0,44,,3.0,11/11/2016,"NOT the premier spot for a burger. I've tried to give it a chance several times but it's just average.

Tammie C.,"Sevierville, TN",15,5,2,2.0,3/2/2016,Well I was looking forward to coming here. But I was somewhat disappointed. My burger was Luke warm at best. Managers walked around with attention on there phones.  There were a total of 6 customers in the restaurant. My server allowed my drink to get empty even though I was only her second customer.  Another server noticed and ask if I would like another drink. I was able to here manager discussing changes is the appearance of restaurant I wondered why he would t begin on customer service first.  My server was flat nothing inviting about returning.

J M.,"Flower Mound, TX",0,13,5,2.0,5/29/2015,Ate lunch here with my son recently. We've enjoyed the Red Robin where we live in Texas but this one fell short. Service was friendly but took a long time for our first contact with the server. We were already ready to order when he first came up for drink requests. Then it took a long time to actually get the food. On top of that there were ants by the wall in our booth. I mentioned it to the server so I hope they follow up on that issue. The food was good but nothing better than any other average place.  We like RR but may not be back to this one next time we visit friends here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hendersonville?start=20
Melissa B.,"Gallatin, TN",27,32,,4.0,7/25/2011,"Maybe it's the milkshakes, the kid food, or the balloons...but my children love this place. My husband and I enjoy the family friendly environment, where we have the option of ordering and adult beverage if we  want something stronger than water, tea, or lemonade.   My biggest annoyance with this place is the lack of utensils, and napkins at the table every time we go in.  I understand wanting to save money, but c'mon napkins are a necessity.

My kids love the bottomless french fries (and a great tip - you can ask your waiter to bring some as soon as you sit down and order your drinks. Every meal comes with them anyway, so they are happy to do so and it keeps the kids eating and quiet.) While perhaps not the healthiest of menus, they do have a great vegetarian selection. Every one of their burgers can be made with either a Boca Burger or a black bean burger. Again, I have to speak kindly about the fact that they have a very nice bar.
