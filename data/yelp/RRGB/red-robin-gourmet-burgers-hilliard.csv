Elisa M.,"Hilliard, OH",39,29,1,5.0,9/18/2016,Red Robin Royalty card - get one if you don't have one. Burgers are nearly always the best around. Big and cooked as I prefer. The seasonal specialty burgers are worth trying. Bottomless fries - seasoned exceptionally. Try the donut tower if available. Freckled lemonade - whether spiked or no - is quite the yum.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hilliard
R C.,"Hilliard, OH",9,11,1,1.0,12/3/2017,"Horrible! This place has gone downhill... so sad. From the minute we walked in, until the minute we left~ dissatisfaction.  Under-staffed, rude customer service, incorrect orders, waiting, waiting, waiting... the restrooms a complete mess.  This used to be one of our favorites, unfortunately (well fortunate for us!)  we will not be returning for another lackluster experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hilliard
Jason S.,"Hilliard, OH",0,6,,1.0,11/17/2017,"Red Robin used to be the go to place with the kids. Went tonight for my sons birthday and it was by far the worst experience we had there. Received a pig out burger with no bacon, a burger with hair in it. The replacement burger was noticeably thrown together quickly and was terrible in appearance so we didn't want that one either. So my wife left hungry. My bottomless root beer floats came with warm root beer that melted the ice cream instantly. Waste of a night, waste of $100. Sorry for the crappy birthday dinner experience son, we will make it up to you.  Booooooooo Red Robin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hilliard
N K.,"London, OH",0,15,,2.0,1/14/2018,"Red Robin is one of my favorite places to eat! However, our past 3-4 visits at this location we've had not so good service. It takes forever to order and get your drinks and when you order appetizers they don't come out until right before your food comes. Their never that busy either. A week ago I ordered a side salad and the Taco Tavern Double. The salad came out and about the second bite in, I noticed a hair. I went to pull it off and it was very long and disgusting. I did get a new salad but my appetite was ruined for the rest of the time. This is the second time I've gotten the Taco Tavern Double and it didn't have the crunchy tortilla strips on it. The meat was low quality also. I think I will find another place for burgers until I get my appetite back for this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hilliard

Tiffany C.,"Columbus, OH",149,455,73,1.0,8/15/2016,"Stopping by this chain on a late Saturday afternoon has completely affirmed to me that this chain has completely sold out and lost it's soul.  Everything was of poor quality, and taste. Like we're talking, I should've just walked my butt down to McDonalds instead. Same quality of garbagey, chewy, burgers to ingest. The saddest part is that this chain didn't really start it's decline until the past few years. There was a time Red Robin was known for decent burgers.  The fries are just totally crappy, lifeless, and usually luke warm (if you're lucky).  I came here for a juicy, hot, cheesy, mind blowing burger, but I have so viciously fooled myself into thinking that this chain produced such quality, and I was left with complete and utter buyers regret, considering the amazing places we have here in Ohio for some beef.  Hell, just drive a few minutes up Trabue Rd to Johnnie's for some REAL meat.  I want my $50 back.  The dessert sucks, too. Don't bother.... All frozen, mildly warmed, and slathered with pathetic, wilting strawberries.  Just an outright shame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hilliard
Michelle M.,"Galloway, OH",0,15,,2.0,12/28/2017,"I saw a 20% off coupon for take out orders on their website and decided to place an order. I went through the whole process and at the end of it, it forces you to enter a credit card to finish. I wanted to pay with cash, so I called it in. I told the woman on the phone (who was friendly) about the 20% off and she said they would take it off when I arrive and pay. When I get there, they send me to the bar to get my order. The bartender is obviously busy and I wait for a few minutes. When he gets to me, I tell him I have a take out order and that I want to use a coupon. He disregarded that and rang it up at normal price. I showed him the coupon on their website and he said that's only for people who have some kind of rewards card or something. I responded that it says nothing about that and it's just 20% off a take out order. He gets frustrated and has to get someone else, so I wait. When the next guy comes, he says he knows nothing about the coupon and didn't want to honor it, but after my persistence he finally re-rang it, but wouldn't take my money, so I waited some more. The bartender comes back to take my money. I hand him a large bill to which he says ""If you want to pay with that, you'll have to give me some time because I don't have change."" Ok, so I dug through my purse and found exact change.  I paid and he did say sorry about the coupon thing. After all this, I get home to cold food. I paid for extra guacamole which I did not get. There were no tortilla strips for my soup which are supposed to come with it. My NachO.M.G. which is basically chilli nachos barely had any chili. The jalepenos were sweet which was weird. There was no cilantro-as the description states. To top it off, I found a hair in my food. The food was not worth the money even with the discount and the staff has an overall air of being bothered or annoyed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hilliard

Meggy M.,"Hilliard, OH",118,1,1,1.0,11/17/2017,"Tonight we went for our sons birthday. He got the pig out tavern double, now the description of this sounded amazing since he loves bacon yet there was no bacon to be found on the burger. The burger I received had small blond hairs in it. They did replace the burger, this burger was burnt to a crisp, cheese was not melted what so ever, a pinch of lettuce and everything else just splatted on. I did not eat this burger either and left hungry, we stopped by Wendy's on the way home and my Jr. Deluxe cheeseburger which was $1.19 was great compared to what I was served at Red Robin. My husband got bottomless Root beer floats that came with hot root beer which melted his ice cream instantly. The manager stopped by our table and asked us if we needed a box, did not apologize for the hair in my food or anything. To top everything off we waited 25 minutes to be seated and walked past at least 15 empty clean tables. Our bill for 5 well 4 since mine was taken off was $100 with tip for food that was sub par.

My boyfriend and I went to red robin cause we wanted some ""gourmet burgers"". God, how could've I have been so stupid?  We got our food. I got a whiskey bbq burger and he got the bleu bbq burger.  I was up all night crapping myself and throwing up and praying that hell would be over soon. Yep, that's right. I got food poisoning. It was my first time getting it and god it was freaking awful.

Gina M.,"Columbus, OH",0,13,6,2.0,10/30/2017,"We arrived at 3  p.m. to have a late lunch. There were lots of empty tables that needed to be cleared so we ended up waiting for 25 minutes for a table. We were a party of only 3. The floors were covered with disgusting smashed food which was really appetizing!  . The floors remained dirty the whole hour and a half we were there!  The waiter took his time bringing our drinks; at least 10 minutes. We ordered an onion ring tower which arrived fairly quickly but the waiter hadn't brought out any napkins, utensils or plates which we had to ask for. Of course it took another 5+ minutes to bring those out so we could eat. Our burgers were delicious and hot but we were NEVER asked if we wanted fry refills by the waiter. We had to ask several times!  We placed our empty water glasses at the end of the table in hope that he would see our glasses were empty. No such luck. I had to flag him down and ask for more water. . Apparently they were short staffed but the Manager should've stepped in to sweep floors and bus tables instead of just walking around looking at her iPad. We won't be back even though we used to love this place. NEED NEW MANAGEMENT SOON!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hilliard
Jay P.,"Hilliard, OH",26,92,1,2.0,4/13/2016,"Got home last night and the first thing my wife says is ""I want a burger for dinner"" Not Hello Honey or How was your day? This told me she had been through a long day and needed some comfort food. We talked about going to a few other places but quickly settled on Red Robin, as we had always had a decent experience there. We walked in and were seated right away in the bar area, which was fine. Our waitress appeared after a minute or two, with a trainee in tow. She took our drinks order and then was soon back to take our food order. My wife had a basic burger with fries and I ordered the Guacamole & Bacon Burger, also with fries. We had not been to a Red Robin for about 6-9 months and noticed they now had these tablets sitting on the table. They are loaded with games, information and more. Before we received our food, our waitress came bye and explained how to use the tablet in full. Not only does it let you play games, but it also let's you sign up for their birthday club, will allow you to pay for your meal if using a credit card and most importantly, will let you leave feedback on your dining experience. Our waitress told us about this particular feature 3 different times during our visit, requesting we give her a ""10"" rating each time.  When our food arrived, my wife's burger was fine, but mine was missing the guacamole. We asked a passing manager why the guacamole and bacon burger had no quac and he was  shocked but quickly went back into the kitchen to get some. Of course, even though he was quick, the burger was now growing cold, as was our feelings about the feedback we were going to leave. We've eaten at this same restaurant about 3 times now and until this meal, never really had any complaints, but we also were never blown away by any of the food. Between the multiple requests for a great rating from our waitress and the burger without guacamole, it will probably be a while before we go back. it used to be that a wait staff would be tipped well if they provided great service, but last night we wondered if being given a good review was more important? My advice to Red Robin, take away the tablets, take away the server reviews and let the wait staff worry about the customers, not their ratings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hilliard
Nick G.,"Columbus, OH",29,3,,1.0,4/1/2017,"Ordered take out tonight (4-1-17) and when I got home my wife and I noticed our burgers were undercooked ( blood dripping from burger onto French fries). Drove all the way back to the restaurant to return food and get properly cooked burgers. I have a seat at the bar and have a beer as I wait for our sandwiches to be recooked. Manager comes out and asked what happened and I simply say ""your cook served us raw meat."" His response is "" is someone getting you taken care of?"" And my reply was yes. He said he would bring my order out when it was done. When he finally brought out our food he says ""you don't owe us anything""............. WTF!!! I'm not one looking for a hand out, but when you serve my wife and I raw burger and I have to drive back to the restaurant to have it corrected, they should have at least bought my beer as I waited for them to refire our burgers. I cannot believe the manager said ""you don't owe us anything"".

Corey S.,"Hilliard, OH",19,53,14,2.0,10/26/2015,"This is a difficult review to write. My rating has changed over time from very good to below expectations. The complaints that I have now are mostly situational related to our local restaurant and perhaps not indicative of the experience you will have at a different location.  Let me start with the good: we have always been happy with the menu and the food. My wife gets a salad with lite dressing, I substitute sweet potato fries. I like the turkey burger, my wife usually likes one of their fancy options and often customizes. The fare is simple, but has always been prepared well and we often look forward to what we are getting. Put simply, the food is good. The bad part is the management of the restaurant and the service. A few years back, we would go at least once a month because we always got seated quickly and the service was fast, friendly, and efficient. Lately, they've gone completely down-hill. Over the last three visits we have had consistent problems 1) getting seated quickly, 2) getting a server to acknowledge us in a reasonable time after being seated, and 3) getting our food to our table in a time frame comparable to previous experiences.  The first of our last three visits, I had to flag down the manager after 10 minutes sitting at our table without a server. She dealt with it well, but it made the whole experience not enjoyable. The second of our last three visits, our service was slow and then we had to wait an extra 15-20 minutes at the end to get our check dealt with because our server lost my credit card. It took half that time for the manager to acknowledge that there was a problem and she made no effort to push to a resolution, instead leaving quickly to go back and expedite orders. Eventually, another server found my card and the manager decided to comp our meal, but it was a complete customer service disaster. This most recent visit, we waited between 5-10 minutes after being seated to be acknowledged by our server. I meant to time the whole visit but forgot until I got frustrated with the delay. I did start the time late when our server finally acknowledged us and from then until the time our food hit the table it took 42 minutes. That is not an acceptable wait for this type of restaurant. To top everything off, they have switched to using the Ziosk devices on the table now. My wife noticed they had trivia on it and so she started playing. It wasn't until we were reviewing the bill that we realized that the stupid thing charged us $2.00 for the short time we spent playing trivia. It does tell you it is going to charge money, but the workflow is very misleading and easy to mess up. If you have a kid or a toddler, keep them completely away from the stupid thing unless you want to pay the extra money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hilliard?start=20
Amy G.,"Hilliard, OH",96,92,2,3.0,6/16/2016,"Service is always just, ""ok.""  It is my understanding that this restaurant is a training restaurant, so I usually let it go when the service is bad.  The food is always good, with the exception of cold sweet potato fries every time we order them.  We always send them back, and they always give us new ones.  The kids menu is great and we enjoy their burger selection.  We will continue to go back, but never with high expectations of service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hilliard?start=20

Mel C.,"Las Vegas, NV",238,1504,8275,3.0,2/13/2013,"In Columbus for a business trip and the group decided on Red Robin.  One thing that I need to get use to when I travel is eating at branded restaurants.  In Vegas, most of the Yelpers eat at locally owned restaurants or one of a kind type joints.  Oh well, I will follow the group and see what happens.  I've been to Red Robin a handful of times, usually for their Turkey Burger and bottomless steak fries.  Yes, I love me some steak fries.  At this Red Robin, I was undecided and I know they are known for their burgers.  I held off a burger because I was having Bachi in a couple of days.  The waitress arrived and I was still undecided.  I freaked out with the pressure of being undecided that I ended up choosing their Nantucket Seafood Scatter.  This consisted of battered cod, fried shrimp, clam strips, and fries.  The food was okay, but to be honest I couldn't tell the difference between the cod, fried shrimp, and clam strips. Everything was covered in batter that it was just that what I tasted could remember, just the batter.  The fries were good like always and they are endless.   When it comes to a Red Robin, there's something for everyone.  Everyone that loves bad for you food that is.  Next time, if there's a next time, I'm at Red Robin I'm going to stick to what I know is good and okay for you...their Turkey Burger.   PS:  Their chili is back on the menu.  Been a long time, but it's some of the best chili you'll find out there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hilliard?start=20

Bottomless fries are great now that Ruby Tuesday's have all but disappeared from most of the area however if they'd give you more from the get go you wouldn't have to go bottomless, kind of like a good date.

There is nothing to special about Red Robin that makes the prices worth the food. I mean a burger is a burger, minus fast food joints. But for a burger fries and drink to run you $10+ is kinda mind boggling. Its not like they use secret ingredients.  If you want a expensive burger this is the place to go. You can get the same quality at Steak n Shake, Applebees, etc, which a number of them will resemble Red Robins prices.

Marissa C.,"Columbus, OH",58,418,33,4.0,10/16/2011,"Red Robin is great when you just want a big ole messy burger and fries.  The fries are unlimited, and the burgers run the scale from your usual hamburger to chicken, salmon, turkey, or veggie, with a wide variety of toppings.  There is usually also a special burger featured for a limited time.  Not into burgers?  That's ok, there are also a variety of entrees.   My husband enjoys the Guacamole Bacon Burger in particular, while I go for a lettuce-wrapped Chicken Caprese - I just love the pesto sauce and fresh mozzerella.  The burgers are large, and I often end up cutting mine in half to enjoy the rest later.  The fries come out piping hot, crunchy, and delicious with a nice seasoning.   We do prefer to go at less peak days/times to avoid the large crowds, and the service is always quite good here when we go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hilliard?start=40

Now if I'm going to eat out I'm going to do it up right. So I order them with garlic,  I tell the waiter I want some garlic on them,  not dry.  Well they come out DRY so I ask for a side of the garlic he brings that out along with another side of ""garlic fries"" the garlic was so scarce Dracula would have eaten them.

That's what made RR great...especially the Carousel horses. Second service seemed a bit slow and my bacon cheeseburger came out without bacon!!! We also ordered the Chocolate Fruffles and I have to say I wasn't impressed. They had too much salt on them. And I would offer a Carmel dipping sauce instead of the whipped cream and the berry sauce needs to be thicker.

What is fun, if you seek an experience more laced with enjoying the experience of life on this absurd planet, is that this is the ""remedial"" restaurant. It is as-if the focus group participants were unable to fathom a menu or ordering and required careful verbal direction. The staff at Red Robin is trained to deliver this treatment and listening to how they do that  is very enjoyable. I really want to go there and say ""So, if I tell you I want something from this list of foods printed on this sheet of paper clad in plastic, that, even though we are not blood kin and i just walked in without an invite, you will make and bring it to me just in exchange for some money?

Even if this is a chain, I really enjoy their burgers.  I have only been disappointed once with coming here dozens of times.  The place is great for kids and now that I have a little one, I feel a little more normal here.  Their burgers can be a little expensive especially if you don't make use of their unlimited steak fries.   Last time here, I ordered the Banzai Burger with Pineapple and a teriyaki sauce.  I really enjoyed this burger as it was think and juicy with a wonderful flavor.  I would utilize the option to change the bun on the burger along with the order.  I ordered it on a jalapeno onion bun.  I also ordered it with southwest black beans instead of the fries, so i would say I spent a little too much but I had a gift card so I wasn't too worried.  I would order the Banzai, Royal Red Robin, the burger with Guac, or the whiskey burger and be happy here.  They have a good amount of choices and do pretty well with making a nice looking burger.  Once I did get sick from eating here, but that was many years ago.  I avoided the place for awhile but my free burger along with my wife's love of this place brought us back.

Erin W.,"Hilliard, OH",3,13,,1.0,10/24/2015,"We have been severely disappointed the last couple times we've been to Red Robin. We used to enjoy this restaurant because the food was good, it was reasonably priced, and it didn't take a long time. Now that we have a toddler, the length of time it takes to get food becomes even more important. My husband was so annoyed at the wait to take our order that he started a timer- I think it was over 26 minutes by the time we got our order in.  We also had issues with the machine on the table- the buttons are misleading so that while thinking I was playing a free trivia game (after all, I did not select ""$1.99 play as many games as you want"" as you want) I accepted charges without being aware of it (the ""cancel"" option is actually where the price seemed to be listed, upon further inspection after receiving a higher than expected bill). Perhaps it's technically my fault for not reading the fine print but no one likes to leave an establishment feeling like they've been taken advantage of. This really should be unacceptable anyway, especially with these devices within the reach of children and, to my observation, most frequently used by them. I was also disappointed to find that instead of taking my more expensive birthday burger off the bill, the billing system removed my husband's less expensive option. Ever since we started patronizing Red Robin they always took the more expensive burger off, regardless of who ordered it, and brought a little birthday sundae at the end of the meal. However, I can understand that this policy might have changed but the other two issues are frankly not forgivable. All of this is on top of previous visits with similar (or longer) wait times at the table and even worse, a waitress who lost our credit card when we tried to pay (which added another 50 minutes to our stay while she walked around aimlessly with absolutely no confidence that she was even looking for it, let alone had notified her manager and asked for assistance from team members).

We got the pretzel bites to start which were pretty good, followed by a shot and some beer, followed by an amazing prime rib sandwich. They served it with au jus on the side, mmm loved dipping the sandwich and fries. They have a really good seasoning mix that you can add to burgers, fries, soup, ice cream.

casey b.,"Columbus, OH",7,20,1,4.0,7/7/2010,"I second the reviewer who said this particular Red Robin is top notch for the chain. I've never left here disappointed-- mostly because the staff is always attentive and perky. The last time I went, I was so impressed with our waitress, Keena, that I had to take the time to contact corporate and tell them what a great job she did. The food is at a very minimum good, and usually great. The royal robin is a fantastic burger, the fries are good, and those smoothie drinks are among the best I've had. My only complaint would be they seem to be a bit stingy with those so called bottomless fries. Don't get me wrong-- there's never any eye rolls about requests for refills of the fry basket.  But on a recent visit, we were starving and asked for our fries to come out before anything, and they brought a basket that was skimpy enough that we couldn't help but start counting them.
