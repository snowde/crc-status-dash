Roxie G.,"Portland, OR",133,131,39,5.0,10/3/2017,We always sit in the bar. No wait. And great service from the bartender. Food is always hot when it gets to us. The beer is always cold and refreshing. The busser Lupe is a sweetheart! I really enjoy this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro
Edward R.,"Beaverton, OR",1,5,,1.0,11/21/2017,"First of all let me say that I am definitely not one to review nor am I one to complain but this has definitely caused some frustration.  For the last 10 years I have always thrown a Christmas party for my employees. This year we chose to go to Red Robin near Hillsboro as we typically go to the one near Mall 205 in pdx. I called two locations, the one on TV highway and the one near 185th letting them know that I would like to host my Christmas party there, I do not need a banquet room I just need to make sure they have enough tables and chairs for my employees to have a good time. I also let them know that I would be putting this on my corporate credit card and that this tab ranges anywhere between $1000-$2000 for this type of event. (They will not make that much money in 1.5 any other way). The first location I called which was the TV highway location gave me a definite no and told me that they were not able to accommodate my request. ONE MONTH IN ADVANCE!! I did express to that manager (Sherri) that that seemed to be poor business and that I could not understand how any business with decline this amount of customers and a paid tab. I asked to speak to her manager. I left my number for a call back.  I then called the location on 188th and asked to speak with the manager Julie unfortunately Julie was not available as she is on vacation so I ended up speaking with the gentleman who was the manager of the kitchen named Pallino. Pallino told me the same thing Sherri from the other location told me and that was that they were not able to accommodate my request because of the hours indicated 5:30pm. I then asked to speak with his general manager and that is when he told me her name was Leanne stein. I called Leanne and left a detailed message and asked for a call back. I revived a calla round 40 mins later from Leanne.  So here it goes.... I cannot express enough the amount of unprofessionalism and lack of customer service that I have received from the general manager Leanne Stein. I am appalled that this restaurant would decline a party of 30 people because it was during their peek hours even though I called to to inform them a month in advance that I would be bring my staff to this location on 12/22/17 arriving at 5:30pm and would be done within 1.5hrs.  I was told they will not accommodate me and my employees as they will loose money on a number of tables that are not able to be turned over because of my large party. She tried to break it down to me in a way that felt was very condescending and not needed, she stated she would need six tables in order to accommodate my party and that's too many to lose money on. She said around 3 years ago they used to take larger parties but those larger parties would stay at the restaurant for way too long and they were not able to make the revenue that they would if they would just stop accommodating large parties. I felt like this is VERY poor business and I am not able to comprehend her reasoning from a business standpoint. There is no way that they are going to make in between $1000 and $2000 within an hour and a half no matter how many people they see. This is guaranteed payment!!! I asked if I could speak with her manager she said she did not have one I asked her where the corporate office was located she told me Denver Colorado she also told me that I could escalate this as far as I want but it will end up back on her desk as she is the regional general manager for this area. Her uncalled for comment about escalating this issue is why I am writing this review because I felt she was unprofessional and felt as if she felt she was the ""Person in charge"" of customer issues or complaints which I know is not the case.  I feel she should have done something to accommodate my large party and since I am not getting a call back from the corporate office I decided the only way for my concern to be seen is to leave a review on each location.  Thanks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro

Jesy B.,"Portland, OR",168,572,29,3.0,11/30/2016,"It's....Red Robin. Neither spectacular or awful. It's consistent, reasonably priced and we can bring the kiddo until late at night - which is a huge bonus because we're late eaters.  It gets super duper busy around dinner time so we avoid it until 9pm. Typically around then you'll get seated in flash. Their menu is extensive - there's pretty much nothing you can't get here. They also have many options to make your meal healthy such as broccoli vs fries. I typically get the BLTA which is surprisingly delicious - fresh croissant and everything.  Service is usually pretty good, though sometimes a bit scatterbrained. There's a tablet on the table that I've never used to order food, but you can if you so want to. More importantly, you can pay your bill instead of waiting.  So...it's perfectly A-OK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro

Kymberly D.,"Snohomish, WA",40,42,69,5.0,2/27/2016,"Tonight our family had dinner at this Red Robin location to celebrate my 11 year old daughter's cheerleading national championship win. (She is writing this review with me and asked me to add that.)   Our family was waited on by Cory with the mustache as our little girl called him. Not only was our food yummy but our waiter Cory was absolutely outstanding. His attention to detail was impeccable. His awareness  of when we needed beverages or condiments as well as to go containers without being alerted was spooky. As if he had a 6th sense. This guy is a god damn mind reader! He   .how much barbecue sauce was on my husbands boneless      Buffalo wings and he put some extra sauce in a cup on the side of the basket! He stated that he was not comfortable with the amount of sauce on the wings and he took the initiative to remedy the problem on his own.  So to the Waiter we are referring to as Cory with the Mustache.....

He kept an eye on our drinks and refilled my girls lemonade without even being asked! He offered the bottomless fry refill as well which we always have had to ask for.  We tried the Mac and cheese in the past and it was ew so we stick to the burgers and fries now. They are always delish as well as the chicken strips! The burgers were done to our liking, juicy and they have a variety of burger fillings.. I was impressed with this Tom fellow. He was on top of our service and I saw he interacted well with the other tables he had. And he made sure that I knew the ""biggest beer"" was a huge mug, sadly I was not able to finish my second mug  The only criticism I have is the children's menu being in Spanish. My daughter does not read Spanish so I had to read it to her and she likes reading the menu options herself..

Brent P.,"Beaverton, OR",33,3,1,2.0,7/1/2017,Red Robin used to be one of my favorite burger joints but not anymore.  Their burgers seem to have gotten smaller and less flavorful.  For today's visit their once fantastic fries were limp and under-seasoned.  My wife always requests her burgers well-done with no pink and 75% of the time they can't get this right.  At this point we will have to think twice about even going for the free birthday burger.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro

Took so long for special desert before our 3 yr old need to leave for bed. Waited for ever for bill. Tried to pay it with iPad which wouldn't take my card. Asked for assistance to get ignored.

Oliver N.,"Hillsboro, OR",102,120,206,1.0,4/19/2016,"Racism still exists I guess, at least it does at this RR. And yes, I'm writing this review while having dinner at RR because we didn't get any attention from the servers.  Came here on Tuesday night with my cousin who was also Asian, yep, Asian hangs out with each other is a thing. We got seated on the bar which is the closest area. We closed our menu like 15mins and nobody came to check on us. The only thing that I got on the table was menu, not even a cup of water. If it was busy, I wouldn't have blamed them. There were 7 people on the bar and they already got their food. We still waited for someone to come and take our orders. Meanwhile, 3 of the waitresses were chatting, to each other and customers and then to each other again. We were so close to leave but my cousin was barely able to walk because she was so hungry so I decided to stay. It took them 15mins to finish their conversations with others to take our orders- unhappily. The lady who took our orders didn't even want to look at our faces, she just looked at the screen and nodded after I said anything for my order. No ""thank you"" , no ""do you need anything else"" or anything, just walked away like we interrupted their conversations.  We smiled, we waited to be seated and we didn't show attitudes because we are nice people and always try to become friendly customers. I had no idea what I did wrong to be treated like this. The guys who sat next to us were taken his orders before us by the way.  I'm a very positive Yelper who always try to ignore negativity and give 5 stars for all the restaurants where I have been to, apparently not this time.  The Asian racism might be my assumption but with everything that I observed today, I guess it must be it.  Me coming back?

I ordered the crispy chicken burger (which is my go to burger whenever dining at red robin). The wait time was pretty long to get our food, but I was there with two other friends so we didn't mind too much. What I did mind was that the server who was serving us kept coming back asking if we were finished, even as we had food on our plates. I noted that there were still several open tables around when she started pestering us, and that got on my nerves. I don't like to be rushed when I'm eating. After feeling like we weren't wanted there, we left. I would give the place two stars, but I guess you can't blame a place based on the actions of one bad server.

Fine, it's New Years Day and other restaurants are closed so I'm sure it is busy in there. We placed our order for a Royal Red Robin Burger and Fish and Chips. Nothing crazy. We were told it would be 15-20 minutes. Great! We arrived 25 minutes later. My husband went inside to grab the order. He was ""greeted"" by the bartender and asked if he had a To-Go order and what his name was. (Also I must point out that he was the only to-go customer). She then did nothing with that information and continued to very slowly help the barside patrons. She then told my husband (5 minutes later) that somebody would help him shortly. Another waitress approached my husband and asked his name. She said ""great, let me get it together for you"" At this point he had been inside for about 10 minutes (so we are sitting at 35 minutes of that 15-20 minute window). 5 minutes later the waitress returned with our food. My husband paid and we went on our way with our food 45 minutes after ordering. We made the 5 minute drive home and opened our boxes. Everything was hardly warm and the fish and chips didn't come with tartar sauce. So we are sitting here with soggy cold fish with no dip and a burger that needed to be microwaved.

Liz K.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,3,,2.0,12/17/2014,this is an update for the review that I did for the sunset Esplanade Red Robin restaurant. Three days after I wrote the review I got a message from someone that was interested to hear about my experience. And wanted to documents what happened so it could be used for better training purposes with there employees. And of course they message many apologies. I think it's a wonderful gesture to take interest in your customers experience . And I appreciate them taking the time to get back to me. So they asked for my contact information and I gladly give it to them. I just got a phone call today and an email from a woman that works at this particular Red Robin location she was extremely apologetic very sympathetic. And wanting to make the situation right. and I didn't ask for this but they gave me a $25 gift card for any Red Robin location. I declined and said that I did not wanted I didn't ask for it that's not what I was looking for. But I appreciated the gesture and she insisted but she gave me the electronic gift card anyway.  So I guess only time will tell if this situation comes of anything. The woman I spoke with today gave me a gesture of faith so I will return the favor and return to the restaurant sometime. I just hope that when my family and I go there that there are changes I hope their staff treat the customers like human beings and not just rushed cash cows. I'll let everyone know how it goes.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro?start=40

So, it is easily our favorite place to eat. That said, we have visited this location many times but up until recently we have had a good experience. The last several times we visited, the service was slow and the food came out cold. We don't tend to complain about food or service because we think maybe it's a bad day or someone called in sick.

Kelly B.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,18,1,3.0,10/12/2015,"Red Robin serves gluten free options, which is a big reason why I come here. Over the last year or so RR has gone through a re-branding. Out went Red, the large bird costume, that used to visit each location on a weekly basis. The menu was revamped with alcoholic beverages moved to the front of the menu. The wait time has increased too, though it's not uncommon at this location to have a long wait with empty tables in the restaurant.  If ordering soup or salad before my meal, it will often come out just before our food arrives. When they get it right, the food is delicious. Having a food allergy, I have never gotten sick while eating here. One of my favorite soups, French onion, now comes out in a tiny square dish with hardly any broth in the dish, which is very disappointing. Recently this location added an electronic tablet at every table. Now people can order electronically and be bombarded by online adds for games people can play for a small charge while sitting at the table. I find these units annoying and refuse to use them. I have enough electronic devices in my life, I like to put mine away at dinner.

Brian I.,"West Linn, OR",62,256,33,3.0,6/26/2012,"I hesitantly checked into Red Robin via the Yelp smartphone app when we were here 2 weeks back, instantly knowing I'd regret it.  You see, I'm not one to ignore Yelp's little reminder that you need to review a restaurant that you checked into.  Yes, you can kill the little reminder, but the OCD portion of my brain won't allow me to do that.  Maybe some combination of therapy and chemicals can help me...?  On a similar note, I intentionally avoided checking into Red Lobster last night for that very same reason.  HAH, I shall foil you yet, Yelp check-in-reminder. So, as the eloquent Bob M. put it, ""what were we doing in here?  Getting a fine burger and good fries.""  Yep, same.  I wanted to try the ""Tavern Double"" I'd seen advertised recently, because I'm a good, traditional American consumer.  I typically avoid RR's burgers because I don't think they're impressive in any way, shape or form.  I will admit that the Tavern Double was fine; even better than their standard burger offerings, I dare to say.  I like Red's steak fries.  I do NOT recommend their ""Three-for-all"", which is the aforementioned steak fries, onion straws and sweet potato fries.  It's not necessary to get fancy, just stick with the tried and true steak fries.  Back to the burger: 2 smallish patties, cheese, lettuce, tomato and thousand island.  That's really it.  I think it's Red's ode to an In-N-Out double double.  You know what, it works.  It's fine.  It's not in the same league as a double double or a Rachel's double, but if you're trapped at Red Robin via gunpoint, it's a good burger choice. *Cue the Debbie Downer music* Three-For-All appetizer: 2,764 mg of sodium Red's Tavern Double: 1,086 mg of sodium That's just the sodium.  No, I didn't come close to eating even half of the appetizer, but still, I'm confident I pushed the 2k barrier for salt.  YUCK.  On top of that, I noticed that their seasoning (in those nifty jumbo dispensers at each table) contain MSG.  Don't let their website fool you: anything that says ""hydrolyzed protein"" IS, in fact, a variation on MSG.  So, is this an indictment of Red Robin?  No, not at all.  RR is FINE, in moderation.  For me, in this case, ""moderation"" = 2x a year, at the most.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro?start=80

I spoke with management asking why people were being seated before our group (at tables that could've been combined to accommodate our group)  and was told they were waiting for ONE PARTICULAR GROUP to finish to put two tables together. That is ridiculous and terrible service. We've had long waits before and the manager has always offered a compensation, such as free appetizer, and nothing was given this time when it was their fault we waited so long. We will not be going back here, and will not be recommending it either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro?start=60
Rita P.,"Hillsboro, OR",11,19,26,2.0,6/4/2013,"Where do I begin... I waited until the next day to write this because I was so angry that I was concerned it would effect what I wrote. To be honest the burgers that my husband and I ordered were really good, once we got them. We were seated right away (because they were not busy three waiters/waitresses were waiting with the hostess doing nothing) but then waited 20 minutes to have our drink order taken. Another 20 minutes to put in an order for food. My daughter was so hungry she was tearing up. When food finally came 30 minutes later our appetizer did not come first. My daughter's Mac & cheese was soupy and cold. The waitress never came back to make sure we were happy with it. Lucky for us but unfortunately for the table behind us they also ordered the Mac & cheese and called the manager over. So we got the manager right after them. Now this may be the only person who cares if the restaurant does well. He was very accommodating and the only reason I give this place two stars instead of one. He comped the app and my daughter's meal and half of the rest. But unfortunately there was no saving us as customers at this Red Robin. This was there third chance. It was an awful 2 hour experience. We ended heading to the Shari's next door to get a to-go-order for my daughter who was understandably still hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro?start=60
Allie A.,"Portland, OR",17,79,21,4.0,12/3/2013,"We are no strangers to Red Robin. The food is yummy, and the service is usually good at this location. I say ""usually"" because our hostess just stared at me when we walked in. She literally didn't say a word to me. I told her how many people and waited to be walked to a table. Seriously? What do they pay you for? Way to bring the only good Red Robin in the area down a star lady. You need to learn a thing or two about customer service.The waitress tonight is great however, and turned the night around with great service and recommendations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro?start=60
Eric L.,"Portland, OR",250,213,3,2.0,1/3/2011,"I've liked all the Red Robin's that I've been to in the past but something, just something, is wrong with this one? My friend and I both couldn't put our fingers on it? Strange. It's called Red Robin, it looks like Red Robin, but it didn't seem like Red Robin. Make any sense? Probably not. Well, after a day of running around, we decided to stop by Hale's to get some omelettes. Unfortunately, we turned in one stop too soon and ended up at the wrong strip mall. We were both starving after running errands all day and just wanted to get our grub on. And Red Robin was right there next to us so we just decided to forgo the omelettes and eat burgers instead. It was an off hour so there were only about 6-7 other tables in the place. We were promptly greeted and seated. We both already knew what we wanted so we just placed our orders. I got the bacon cheeseburger (provolone) medium with garlic fries and my buddy got the avocado bacon with garlic fries. I asked the server to bring us some fries beforehand because we were starving. A short while later, he came out with our drinks and the fries. Very prompt service. Then less than 10 minutes after that, out came the burgers. Herein lies the problem, I think. It looked like a Red Robin burger, but it didn't taste like one. Now I'm not saying they have the best burgers because quite frankly, they're far from it, but their burgers are usually decent. I go there for the garlic fries anyway. But my buddy and I both agreed that there was something wrong with both of our burgers. Was it the meat? Or the bun? The veggies? A combination of things? Who knows because we couldn't figure it out. It just didn't taste good, not even decent.  I probably wouldn't visit this RR again because there are two other locations near my place. The service was good but the burgers weren't. It's a shame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro?start=60
Avery P.,"Beaverton, OR",108,18,1,3.0,2/19/2014,Service was slow tonight.  Tok almost 30 minutes for our food to come out.  French onion soup was too salty.  But my sandwich was really good as always.  New renovations are really nice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro?start=60
Julie A.,"Portland, OR",1,7,,5.0,8/9/2013,"My husband loves to come here for their sweet potatoe fries! My daughter specifically asks to come here for her birthday because of one waitress- Rachael. She absolutely loves her! She is very friendly and on top of drink refills and meals coming out in a timely fashion! She knows what to offer for those that are eating clean, which is a top priority for me. Overall, my family always has a great time and a great meal at this Red Robin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro?start=60
B P.,"Forest Grove, OR",0,9,,1.0,7/13/2014,"This location has consistently bad service. My experience in the last two visits (6/17 & 7/13) have been food not coming out as ordered, food coming out slow, & not being able to get the waitresses attention because she never comes back. The waitresses in particular are unenergetic, inattentive and with flat personalities that really don't care. I feel this is limited to the Hillsboro location as I found the Tanasbourne/185th location to have excellent food service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro?start=60
CodyandTiffany H.,"Newberg, OR",2,36,4,1.0,6/7/2013,"We eat at Red Robin weekly. It's convenient and moderately priced. That being said... one week we had to order take out b/c 2 of our kids had bronchitis and they were going to try and eat their favorite meal, Mac and cheese. When we ordered and asked for the Mac and cheese refills to be included the server argued with us stating that they don't give the refill on to-go orders. Longer story short, the GM had to get involved, eventually we were able to order. Tonight we ordered Togo again, the order was incorrect, they said they would remake it if we came back. No offer to compensate for the incorrect food, fuel or time. Those were just two instances, I could go on... I won't. I need to move my family closer to Helvetia Tavern. Great service, locally owned and incredible food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro?start=60
Brittany H.,"Portland, OR",95,45,,3.0,5/31/2011,"Ah, good ol' Red Robin.  This is a great stand-by when you want something familiar.  But unless you want a side of baby with your dinner, then sit in the bar during peak hours.  All of the items aren't very experimental, but good.  My boyfriend and I first ordered way overpriced drinks; he got a very tall beer, and I got their ""famous"" T.N.T. which was $7.99 (!!) and was basically a Long Island Iced tea.  Then we both got side salads.  They were decent, but we were over charged.  Our server did fix it without fuss though.  We weren't even done with our salads when they brought out our entrees.  That was a nice change.  You gotta love quick service.  I decided to try something different and got the Ribblets & Mac 'n' Cheese.  There wasn't much meat on the ribblets, but the mac and cheese made up for it.  My boyfriend got the Burnin' Love Burger, which wasn't all that burning. Overall, good food, good service, good atmosphere, but really overpriced for what you're getting.  Is it just me, or are all the chain restaurants blowing up their prices recently?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro?start=60
Rebecca W.,"San Diego, CA",20,249,42,3.0,7/25/2011,"Good 'ole Red Robin. Nothing fancy, family friendly, good food, decent prices. Some days food and service is worthy of 5 stars, others maybe 2 stars. It just depends on the staff that day. But one thing that stays the same is my kids get fill their bellies filled with food they like, I get a break and we all leave happy. The place seems to be run fairly well. There are never any big issues to contend with.  The food is almost always cooked properly, staff is friendly enough and usually competent enough, and the joint seems clean enough. All very important to keep people like me coming back. Most everything they serve that I have tried is good; loaded in calories though! I stick to the salads usually these days.  I have only had negative issues with the food on a couple of occasions out of the hundreds of times I have eaten here. That isn't too bad.  As with most chain restaurants, it can be very loud, crowded and a lot of turn over with the staff. You really never know what you are going to get when you walk in the door. However, it's a quick and easy choice for families or large groups as there is something on the menu that should please almost everyone in your group.   The down side of Red Robin is the high calorie foods, lack of gluten free or organic foods and vegetarian options, lack of creativity in food preparation and cramped seating.  All of which are common problems with all chain restaurants unfortunately.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro?start=60

Andy J.,"Hillsboro, OR",1,7,,1.0,12/10/2014,"I'm not sure why this restaurant has two stars, maybe as more current reviews come in it will average out to the one star it barely deserves.  As many others have said service is extremely slow the bussing  is slow so you have to eat amidst a pile of dirty dishes and leftover food.  French fries are usually cold and there is no point in ordering the ""bottomless fries"" because you will be done eating before they ever arrive.  At the very least you would like to say that the staff is friendly, but they are not! If you're in that area and need a substitute chain restaurant, we now much prefer Shari's, next door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro?start=60
