Ginger W.,"Grand Haven Charter Township, MI",81,39,31,2.0,1/21/2012,"I agree the burgers are great and the fries are super yummy but even with 10 waitresses and a bartender and only 3 people eating here, we sat food and drink free for 20 minutes. The ladies seemed more interested in social time than helping customers. My hubby and I were super bummed. The red robin in Granville has much better service. What a bummer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holland?start=20
Nicole S.,"Chicago, IL",41,156,19,4.0,7/6/2011,"I enjoyed my first ever experience eating at this Red Robin very much! Our waitress was sweet explaining everything to us having never been there before but knowing they are known for thier burgers I ordered the Guacamole bacon burger (bunless) wrapped in lettuce it was absolutely fantastic! I would have loved to gobble up bottomless fries with thier special seasoning blend, but I'm laying off the carbs so I opted to have a side salad. My burger was cooked perfectly and quite filling. I don't live in the area but travel that way often so I will most definately stop in again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holland?start=20
Leang E.,"Chicago, IL",406,2004,522,4.0,1/4/2009,"I had such a great experience with the location in Minnesota, opening my eyes up to guacamole in burgers and other things that I have eaten that I tried the California Chicken Burger and loved it as well.  It had all the elements of things that I like in a burger and it was so tasty.  It's going to be a toss up the next time I come here.  I was disappointed in the service a bit.  Our waiter seemed really tired or something.  I know it's near the end of the night and I don't expect enthusiasm but it seemed like everything he did felt like it required so much effort.  It was strange.  I didn't taste the A1 Peppercorn burger, but a couple people did and said it was salty here.  Love that you get unlimited fries, but kind of dangerous if you are trying to lose weight.  The have really good drinks here too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holland?start=20
Sean M.,"Holland, MI",8,163,,4.0,9/10/2009,"Found a new sandwich that is very good.  The Baja Turkey club is tasty, a little spice and like all Red Robin meals very filling!  I just enjoy this place and I am glad they opened one in my home town!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holland?start=20
Bob K.,"Normal, IL",202,438,597,5.0,7/16/2017,"Best Red Robin that I've ever been to.  We stopped in today with a big group of 10 and we're easily accommodated.   Service was top notch. Since we were a big table, our server, Bronson, had a lot of work to do but we didn't see one empty glass the entire meal.  The manager and another server helped a bit to get all the fry refills and food out in a timely fashion.  I'm not from the Holland area, but if travel through here again, we will likely stop again for another visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holland
R V.,"Holland, MI",1,28,14,1.0,12/26/2017,"It's possibly the worst service in Holland.  My prediction for 2018 is that Red Robin will be the next franchise restaurant to fall to the wayside.  Slow service, overpriced food.  Bottomless fries if you have an extra half an hour to wait for the undercooked fries.  My guess is a managerial problem because there seems to be a lot of people working but no one is doing anything.  This was a great place 5 years ago but this will be the last time for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holland
Meatstick R.,"Holland, MI",0,1,,2.0,7/29/2017,So I'm giving Red Robin 2 stars not on there quality of food but the fact the promotion of there bottomless fries you never use have to ask to get them then now apparently I have to ask for more . So apparently they don't have bottomless fries an there burgers are good but  not worth 14.00$,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holland
Marie M.,"Grand Rapids, MI",93,117,688,4.0,6/1/2015,"We visited on 5/31/2015 @ around 1:30ish LOCATION:  easy to find being located on West Shore Dr. STAFF:  Our server (Chelsea, had glasses), was very kind, but we did have to flag her down for things (napkins, refill).  On her behalf it was busy when we first got there. STORE:  Seemed clean for the most part. Didn't see any huge messes. FOOD:  My Bleu Ribbon burger was cooked perfectly (Medium), nice & juicy.  Fries were excellent!  I love their campfire sauce, yum!!  We were very happy with the food.  Kids didn't like the freckled fruit. I would return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holland
Kelly M.,"Niles, MI",0,19,6,1.0,5/6/2017,Stopped here for lunch today.  Everyone was friendly.  The appetizer was set down not even 2min before our burgers.  Wished they'd have waited a bit. The real issue was later. Both of us have been violently ill since eating there.  I will spare the details but we are seriously regretting stopping here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holland
Nick B.,"Holland, MI",0,13,,5.0,8/20/2016,I only go to eat here once a year with my family and every time they never disappoint me. But this time I brought my sister from Canada and she thought it was the best restaurant in America. I would recommend this to anyone.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holland
Steve P.,"Holland, MI",0,36,,1.0,4/16/2016,"Just played Red Robin Roulette again.  Placed a carry out order.  Who knows what you get.  This time we ordered 2 entree salads, they forgot the salad dressing.  Also Very Little lettuce.  It is an entree, not a side. How hard can this be?  Lettuce is cheap. Called the manager, have us 2 gift certs, but basically blew me off.  He thinks Ben and CJ can do no wrong.  Wow, what a blind spot! He refuses to recognize that he has a problem.  I will use the certs and never order carry out again, if he actually sends them.   I can rate them higher for in restaurant, but not for carry out",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holland
Mercedes D.,"Hamilton, MI",44,18,,4.0,12/7/2016,Food was awesome but the service was okay.  The waiter was okay but needed to be more friendly.  Okay service and awesome food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holland
Timothy D.,"Traverse City, MI",48,13,2,3.0,10/24/2015,"My family went back to Red Robin after having been away for a while. Since we are a family of seven, it's a splurge to go out even to a restaurant like this.  We love their fries and the kid's enjoyed their meals. But I, along with my children, were disappointed with the service. It wasn't as attentive as we would have hoped and it took a while to get our bill after we had finished. I felt like this Red Robin has begun to skimp on their fixings. I had the Whiskey River BBQ burger. It used to come with tons of onion straws and a good portion of BBQ. This time it was minimal. Are they trying to make even more money on a $10 plate?  Because of cost and wait time, I'm not planning on coming back much with my family. I do hope this was just an aberration, so I probably will try it again to see. We really love their fries and the atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holland
Riley H.,"Holland, MI",44,29,7,4.0,1/8/2016,"I love Red Robin. The day I found out it was coming to Holland, I was overjoyed. My family and I would always have to go out to Grandville to enjoy its food, so I'm glad it became local. As the years have gone on, the trips have come fewer, not because I'm not 13 and want to go to the same place over and over again, it's because it's been slacking. The food is still good, but the management/staff hasn't always been incredible. The fries though...cmon now, I know for a fact that 5 years ago those ""bottomless fries"", weren't about 7 per basket. I can literally see the bottom of the basket. The atmosphere is lit though, as it usually always is. Don't get me wrong, I love Red Robin, but bro pick up your game.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holland
Grandma T.,"Hamilton, MI",0,10,,2.0,10/27/2016,"Food is good. But service is very, very slow. The last two times we were there we had to ask for a server to wait on us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holland
Chris D.,"Buffalo, NY",5,22,2,2.0,2/3/2016,"Not my best RR experience. First time at this location. Burger was over cooked and wait staff was not as attentive as they could have been. But they were friendly. If this was my first time at Red Robin, I probably wouldn't ever go back. But I've had good burgers at other locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holland
Jay S.,"Grand Rapids, MI",52,207,34,4.0,5/9/2013,The food was good as we have come to expect at Red Robins.  The wait staff was a bit scarce after she took our order even though it was a pretty dead night.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holland
Alan K.,"Holland, MI",0,16,49,5.0,2/26/2015,The service was great the food was above average. The staff went out of their way to attend to our every need!! Our  experience was great. Recommended by our 3 food critics,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holland
Jeff K.,"Marco Island, FL",0,19,1,2.0,5/31/2015,Love the food but it seems every other time we get horrible service.  Food came out cold and the waitress was indifferent. It's a bummer because this place could be so much more.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holland
Bronx C.,"Holland, MI",0,5,,5.0,1/10/2015,Every time im craving a burger i go here! The 5 alarm burger and banzai burger is the best burger spicy to perfection! For the past 6 years on my birthday my wife knows where i want to go eat! Nice and friendly staff!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holland
Franklin D.,"Indianapolis, IN",360,781,166,3.0,7/11/2012,"Friendly girl waiting on us (6 people) spent most of her time refilling our drinks and bringing out more and more fries....enough to almost ruin our lunch with ;) The fries have a delicious magical powder on them that makes them irresistible. Purposefully went here because it was someone's birthday, and they did not disappoint. They sang one of those horrible corporate birthday jingles which we decided was not embarrassing enough, so we re-sang it our own way. yay! Tried the new ""Nantucket Nasty Bucket"" that features ""lighty breaded clam strips""... which means heavily breaded clam necks...no bellies. Also a few shrimps that tasted pretty good, but again super heavy breading. Finally, two pieces of fried cod that I doused with malt vinegar. It's ""seafood"" for people who hate seafood! Quick, drown it in tartar sauce!  I could liberate the shrimps from the bread prison, but the clamish bits were melded into the breading through some secret corporate processing technique which made it impossible to peel them out.  One nice thing I will say for RR.... I hate when I peel the breading off the shrimps and they haven't been deveined... that is so gross. But they used some larger shrimps here, and cut out the veiny parts. You know what though.... $68 for 6 people before tip.... not so bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holland
John B.,"Macatawa, MI",1,34,2,4.0,5/10/2014,"Noisy, but distraction driven atmosphere. Burgers are made to ore, with a wide variety to choose from.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holland
Jennifer N.,"Covert, MI",0,13,,4.0,8/2/2014,"Good, friendly service, server accommodated special requests with no problem. Burgers are great, though the fries could've been a little hotter.

James D.,"Holland, MI",0,5,,4.0,11/7/2013,"While I'm not crazy about chains, I dig Red Robin and I like our Holland Red Robin particularly.  The service is great and I appreciate having a place  where my gluten sensitive wife can dine.  She loves the gluten free buns and I love that RR offers them.  I also love that RR cooks burgers to order.  It's amazing how hard it is to get a medium rare burger anywhere else.  My only beef is the bar.  Typical chain selection.  No decent porters or stouts and lousy cheap liquor suited for the college age crowd.  But I will suffer a poor drink selection for a great burger any day!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holland
