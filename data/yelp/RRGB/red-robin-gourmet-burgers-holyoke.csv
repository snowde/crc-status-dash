Chris R.,"Easthampton, MA",16,7,3,2.0,2/13/2016,"Although the food is ok, how bad can you mess up a flat burger. Well you can. The waitress asked if we wanted pink or no pink and my three kids and wife said no pink. Guess what? They all had some pink after waiting 45 minutes for them. The place was full, but they just cheese burgers.  I got cheese stick. They must of sat in the window   wile the burgers were being made because of course they were cold. That was my third and last time. For $65 I should've gone to Wendy's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holyoke?start=20
Dan R.,"New York, NY",94,101,2,3.0,9/20/2016,"This place is easily the best chow on i91. The burgers are good tasting real meat. They have nice combos too. I just enjoyed some smoke ketchup with a giant Angus burger. They lose a star because their employees make a lot of mistakes. Last time they forgot the cheese & returned with the same burger, only very well done. This time they forgot the sautéed onions I wanted to pay extra for. Oh and that yummy smoked ketchup that came included on my $16 burger? They charged me for it. Still, for road food, it's great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holyoke?start=20

Steve D.,"Northampton, MA",0,4,,1.0,2/11/2017,"Was just there for a quick lunch. We placed our order for two burgers and fries, nothing unusual or elaborate. We waited over 25 minutes. Our waitress was great. She was clearly very busy. She apologized for the wait. Eventually we just left. People at a table next to us who had been seated after we were got their food about 10 minutes before we left. Not sure what happened.

Ashley p.,"Three Rivers, MA",7,42,,3.0,5/8/2016,I don't usually write reviews on chain restaurants because I don't ever have high expectations for quick stop.  I've been here before and always have had decent service and pretty good burgers without a complaint except for last Saturday my friend and I went there for lunch. We waited about 10 minutes for a table and then we started walking towards the back of the restaurant. We must of passed 10 tables full of dirty plates and food. It was gross. I don't want to be walking in a restaurant full of dirty tables. We get to our table and our table was clean but the floor was dirty with old food on it. I was annoyed and wanted to speak to a manager because I thought it was unacceptable. I didn't end up speaking to them but I knew I was going to Yelp about it. I hope a manager sees this and makes an adjustment.. Maybe under staffed that day who knows! Just don't want to eat in a filthy restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holyoke?start=20
Shawnee M.,"East Hartford, CT",93,24,5,1.0,7/13/2015,"My sister and I were in the area shopping yesterday and stopped to eat here. Service started out good,  we were seated,  ordered and received our food.  Upon biting my sandwich,  I noticed a hair in it!  We told the waitress,  she promptly took it off the bill, the manager came by to apologize and offered a free dessert and mentioned that some of the people in the back had beards,  so he would go back to see who ""needed a trim"".... I ate a piece of sisters hamburger and tried the dessert....We paid & left.   We got on the highway heading back home to connecticut about 15 minutes into our ride,  my sister stated feeling nauseous,  we stopped at a nearby store and she immediately ran to the bathroom with vomiting and diarrhea,  I experienced the same once I reached home. I know this is TMI but this should never occur after eating at a restaurant. I'm convinced there was something wrong with the beef,  I had to stay home from work because my stomach is still in pain.

Brendan C.,"Brighton, MA",0,7,,1.0,1/30/2016,Firstly waited for 40mins but the expectation was set and this could not be helped.  Found out after finishing my Soda that the glass was crusted with crud from a previous drink.  So gross that I had to cancel my food order because my appetite was shot. Waitress and Manager were very apologetic and this was appreciated but still I felt sick so not a good experience.

Dawn P.,"East Northport, NY",82,55,1,4.0,2/13/2016,Red Robin always has awesome burgers. The Black and Blue burger was out of this world. Cooked to perfection. The only weird thing was the little cup of something like parmely an blue cheese to dip in that was yucky. The sweet potato fries were delish so was the Artichoke spinach dip! The one bad thing was they say us next to the bar and it was freezing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holyoke?start=20
Mitch W.,"Monterey Park, CA",960,856,7750,4.0,1/31/2012,"Great Service!!! We decided to try this branch of RR on Sunday night (1/29/2012) and from the time you walk in the door to time time you leave, the people who work here are practically all smiles.  The attend to you as if you were on your death bed.  They cater to your every need. The place was packed to the gills when we arrived around 7pm, but there was no wait and we got a small booth in the back of the restaurant (near the kitchen area).  It wasn't too close to hear all the kitchen noise, but close enough to see all the orders coming up and servers scrambling to get the hot food to their tables. Our server, Rae, let us know they had run out of fresh melon and were out of two types of bread, but other than that everything was available.  After getting our drinks, she brought an order of french fries to our table (BOTTOMLESS STEAK FRIES!).  I haven't been to RR in many years, so I was surprised to see bottomless fries.   We split a natural burger and a chicken salad.  Both items were very good and our burger was cooked to order.  Our water glasses were filled before we asked (a plus) and Rae checked on us about 3 to 4 times after we got our food. Overall, an excellent experience and I like superior customer service! Xie Xie!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holyoke?start=20
Luke Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",145,230,34,5.0,12/1/2014,"Strangely I went to this Red Robin for dinner and then again for lunch the next day. Not planned, but I wasn't sorry. Their training is very good, the servers are all very helpful and positive. The food is consistent, and they do a good job with allergy stuff (they kept our unseasoned fries flowing, because they know what's up). It was also not freezing for no reason like several other Red Robins I've been to. Insider tip: Though they got rid of sizes on the menu, you can still ask for a small of the salads. The regular size is so enormous!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holyoke?start=20
Dan R.,"East Falmouth, MA",103,1615,5633,4.0,2/1/2014,"We went to Red Robin a few weeks ago for dinner and the food was amazing. I had a Whiskey River Burger and loved it. My partner got the Teriyaki Burger and thought it was delicious as well. The onion rings were great and the other appetizers we had were great as well.  The only downside to the whole meal was that they ran out of french fries, and we ended up only getting one order with our burger instead of two. They were also extremely busy, so we had limited face time with our waiter.

Literally an hour (HOUR) later, we got our very cold very unappetizing food.  It was actually just not good.

First, the burgers. Yes, they're very good, every single time. The meat is quality, it's always cooked just right, and the gourmet cheeseburger (our favorite) is stuffed and juicy. Add in a good bun -- not too chewy -- with French fries cooked crunchy as we prefer, and we rate it well above other burger chains (like Five Guys, for instance). The service at this location has always been uncommonly friendly and efficient; we've never encountered long waits even with crowds. Other likes: chili, milk shakes, Whiskey River burger and the beer selections. Our only complaint: they aren't closer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holyoke?start=20

I asked them the day before if it was possible to accommodate a party of 24 people and they said they can make it happen as long as I call a half hour ahead. I did as so, and when I arrived they had the table ready for my entire party and had two waitresses to service my table immediately. It was amazing service and the food was delicious!

We had an AWESOME Red Robin experience.  Our waitress was extremely friendly and courteous, offering us fries as soon as we sat down and extra dipping sauces!  I ordered a Mai Tai (hey it's Sat night) and it was absolute perfection. My fiancé was nothing but pleased with his never ending Sprites that always made their way to the table before he was finished with the last.  I ordered a burning love burger, which is my go to and was absolutely Yummmmm. I don't like cheese, but forgot to ask for it to be withheld. When the waitress saw me picking off the cheese she insisted on taking it back and giving me a new party, which was super sweet.  My fiancé ordered a Tavern burger which he loved. $6.99 for double patties and secret sauce, who could ask for more?!

Scott L.,"Westfield, MA",36,39,71,4.0,8/2/2013,"I eat here like once or twice a month.  Not because it's high on my list of choices but because the rest of the family likes it. A LOT. Additionally its one of the few places we can all agree on eating at together with minimal complaint and the restaurant fits a large party in easily on most nights.  Overall they do a bang-up job here. The staff tends to be attentive and the food is delivered hot and tasty if you're into honest-to-fried-goodness.  Only had one recent incident of slow service and cold food. Management was notified and they cheerfully deducted the offending items from the bill without a hassle. For that, they earned an extra star.  Beer geek tip: Always ask whats on draft if you're getting a beer.

Angie R.,"Pasadena, CA",55,149,381,2.0,1/1/2013,I had not been to red robin in awhile so I was eager to go here post Xmas celebration. The place was busy due to the lunch crowd but we had no problems being seated. The waitress was attentive and cheerful. I'm sad to say this is not the red robin I remembered. I had their original cheeseburger and it was nothing special. I could have made a better burger by going to the local Stop N Shop and making my own with George Foreman grill. The burger was cold and tasteless despite having it with melted pepper jack cheese and all the usual burger toppings. The steak fries were the only thing that I enjoyed. There were hot and crispy which were welcomed company to the cold New England winter.

Mark T.,"Chandler, AZ",409,574,963,1.0,5/19/2010,"First thing to note - there is nothing to eat in Holyoke. I continued down the road and stumbled on a nice area of town with some shopping and dining opportunities. I have been to multiple Red Robins and they typically are always good.  The hostess seated us and mentioned she would take our orders and told us the name of our server. She said ""she's good"". We ordered water and it arrived quickly. One of the people in my party ordered the regular cheese burger. Using the menu and Red Robin's list & description of the ingredients, she indicated she did not want mayo or pickle relish. When it arrived, it had pickle relish. She pointed out that wasn't correct. The waitress said she wrote down pickles and did offer to make a new one, but at that point, the others had scarfed down half of their meal and it would be a hassle. She said they would take it off the bill.  The manager came around and said the server explained what happened and it would be taken off the bill. She said feel free to order some more fries to munch on or whatever. Pretty big, I thought, considering they are bottomless fries. To my surprise they may not be bottomless fries because we never saw another one. A second person in group had eaten her fries halfway through her burger. Any refills? No. How about that water? It sat empty for a long time. Eventually the server came by to fill that up as we were about to leave. Mistakes do happen and they did try to fix it, but at that point it wasn't worth it. Still, the fries should be bottomless and the drinks filled. If you know there is already someone who is unhappy, you should give some attention to try to perform some service recovery to make the experience at least tolerable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holyoke?start=40

The problem is that the past half-dozen times I have been, the burgers have come out cold.  At first we gave it a pass, then we told the waitress, and even gave it a few more chances.  But we're done now.  If I need a good burger in the area, I'll go to Longhorn or Local Burger.

Props first to the service, our server (also the bartender) was excellent conversational and offering great recommendations. We asked many questions and she never batted an eye.  Her recommendations were perfect too. We both really enjoyed our meals. The portions were a good size for the price (unlike some chains, eh, Bar Louie). And the fries were as good as advertised (and UNLIMITED)!! I tried the recommended campfire sauce - excellent!  Only two small complaints. One, RR is super popular with the kiddies.

Dae M.,"Southampton, MA",4,6,,5.0,9/3/2013,This was my first time eating here since going gluten free after being diagnosed with a gluten allergy. Sadly my experience with other area restaurants has left a lot to be desired. I get a lot of strange looks when asked to leave out the bread and such but tonight was a whole new ball game. Our server Kurt asked if my request for a gluten free bun was due to an allergy and from the moment i said yes he made sure the staff was sure to make everything safe for me right down to the fries. Personally i didn't feel he had to go that far but the service was incredible and it really meant a lot. There were no weird looks and no rolled eyes. Just concern that i was well.

Alicia C.,"Silver Spring, MD",107,241,64,3.0,12/28/2008,"Great way to end the week of gluttony that was my return to my hometown for the holidays... 'gourmet' burgers... tons of selection... flexibility with add-ons... all things that made for a good meal that left me stuffed. There were some questionable parts to the dining experience... like putting my name in for a table when I first arrived... It was pretty busy, I expected a wait, but wasn't in a rush since I was meeting people and was early... when the hostess told me 20-25 min, I thought 'no prob, I'm by the time we're called everyone else will be here'... so I tell her that's fine... her reply? 'really? you want to wait that long? what if I said 1 hour... would you wait then?' -note to red robin- you probably don't want your hostess turning away people at the door by making them question a wait time... especially when it isn't particularly long. Overall, the experience was a mixed bag really. Some other lows were them being out of the mix to make the baileys Irish cream shake, and our near constantly absentee server. But then there was some good to balance it out... the towering stack of onion rings! the burgers (pretty good, but would have been better if they were medium like I asked instead of well-done...), the fries (even better with the seasoning, left on the table so you can control how much to add), and the chocolate shake... though I wasn't able to finish all of it. Bonus points for the decor, liked all the wall art... but the sheer amount of it was distracting to the point where I began to wonder if I have a touch of ADD... To top off the night, we tried to get our waitress to take a group pic of us. When she was nowhere to be found, we headed up to the front to ask the host (different person than when we first got there)... he obligingly took a pic for us in front of their replica of the statue of liberty (holding a burger of course)... on 3 of our cameras... OK maybe 3 cameras was a -bit- much... but oh well, at least we had our fun!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holyoke?start=60
Lisa B.,"Chicopee, MA",1,3,,4.0,7/2/2014,"We always enjoy the food, atmosphere and value. The only downside for me is the mixed drinks have been on the weak side.

Chris M.,"Weymouth, MA",20,114,11,4.0,5/21/2011,"I can't relate to the service complaints from other reviewers here because I've never once had a problem at Red Robin.  I've never had to wait more than a few minutes for a table, even at the busiest of times, and never had an issue with table service.   As far as the food, come here for the burgers.  I can't speak on the other food (why would I order a noodle bowl at a burger joint? ) but they do burgers right.  The Whiskey River BBQ burger and All American CheeseBurger are my 2 favorites.  Drinks, beers are always fine.  Fries are the steak variety (not my fav) so don't fill up on just those.   Overall, its a solid place for a burger.  Don't expect the red carpet rolled out for you and you'll be fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holyoke?start=60
Greg L.,"Deerfield, MA",9,3,1,2.0,3/20/2012,"Overpriced. Hardly a ""gourmet"" burger. The fries may have been ""bottomless,"" but since I never saw my server again after she delivered the food, how would I know?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holyoke?start=60
Mary Ellen B.,"North Haven, CT",12,2,,2.0,10/28/2014,it was my first visit to any Red Robin and was served a room temperature burger.  I had to ask for napkins and silverware.  I ordered a chipolte sauce - that was never delivered.  I was told by the manager that my burger was probably done before my onion rings which was yet another add on to change from french fries.  I thought a cook should know how to coordinate a meal so it all arrives hot and edible.  NEVER going back to any Red Robin.  YUK!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holyoke?start=60
J H.,"Somerville, MA",0,4,,1.0,12/26/2013,First - I have never ever written a review in my entire life.   Best part free wifi.  This helped keep my child calm during this extremely negative experience with food and staff.  Thank god for netflix Worstever experience I have ever had in my 30 years as an adult. 1. Child given rotten chunky milk.  2. Asst manager explaining the frequency of milk delivery.  3. Salad dropped off waited 10 minutes. Finally I got up to get my own silverware 4. Waitress was never seen until we requested the bill. 5. Chicken Alfredo after 45 minute wait was cold. 6. Same Asst Manager explained how they cook it for 5 minutes. 7. Plate of pasta came back and pasta was floating in butter so much that I spooned out 10 tablespoons of butter before I touched it.  Could not eat it because in my head I thought it could have been made with rotten milk. 8. Walking to bathroom watched the same Asst manager eating fries in the open kitchen and then serving plates after. 9. Head Manager argued with my husband that the pasta should have that much butter. He pointed out that the picture in menu of the dish was miles different from my dish. 10. Topper was the only  comp was the 4.99 rotten milk kids meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holyoke?start=60
R C.,"Sheffield, MA",1,74,,2.0,1/29/2014,"The service was bad start to finish. We sat waiting to be seated (we were the only ones waiting) for what seemed like forever (starving) so that should have been a bad sign. Then we sit down, waited again forever for the waitress to come. She finally came, we ordered drinks and food right away. The food came before the drinks, and once again, waited forever for the drinks. I ordered the Red Robin Gourmet burger thinking, go with the generic and I cant go wrong. Well, it was a mess. Too much lettuce, too much of everything else, it just fell apart on the plate. I remember these fries being better! I was disappointed because I hadn't been to Red Robin in years, but the last one I ate at was amazing (in the Albany NY area). We wont be going back here again.

John R.,"Amherst, MA",90,246,38,5.0,5/24/2009,"This was my experience though I have heard from others that they had more like a 3-4 star experience. Maybe I was lucky. On the way back from CT, I stopped by around lunch time on a Friday. What was I thinking the place was packed! But, luckily for me solo status, I slipped cleverly to the bar and pulled up a seat. A Sam Adams Lager was within my grasp within 2 minutes and my order was taken shortly and smartly a few minutes later. A five alarm burger I believed they called it. Jalapenos and all it was one of the best burgers I have ever tasted and I LOVE burgers, as long as they are cooked right. Fries were steak size and perfectly cooked. Place was clean and tidy with neat decor. I'd go again if only I had an excuse to go south....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holyoke?start=60

Doug P.,"Westfield, MA",3,24,8,4.0,7/26/2010,Even though it is not a one-of--a-kind restaurant the food is always very food here.

So I finally walked up to the bar, and I was finally able to sit. The person told a waitress she had a table The waitress Acted as if she didn't want a table and pretty much asked if the other waitress could take it.

Shayla M.,"Springfield, MA",10,22,3,5.0,9/26/2017,"A great experience. Highly suggest trying the bonzai burger, great with either beef or i normally get chicken. Ive been getting it for years now, i could eat it every week! The bottomless fries are amazing, but you HAVE to ask for the campfire sauce. Its addicting, i would buy a vat of it if i could. We always fight over it at the table so everyone asks a personal little cup! All their milk shakes are so tasty, the monster size comfortably feeds 2. We never bother with appatizers because the free endless fries are usually enough!  Never had a bad time. Oh, not like you come here to drink anyway, but ive noticed their alcoholic drinks are extremely weak, even for my non drinker tongue. Sure they taste great but dont exspect a buzz even after a couple.  Bathrooms clean and staff always pleasent. Large dining area ensured never a long wait time for a seat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holyoke
Jocey H.,"Amherst, MA",6,12,4,2.0,11/11/2017,"Hit or miss with this location. This time, huge miss. They renovated since we were here last. Previously, the walls were covered with all different size pictures and prints and a large neon Red Robin sign inside. The ceiling tiles were different colors and there were polygon drop lights all around. Now, there's a grand total of 3 art pieces in the whole location, and two of them were painted directly on the wall. The drop lights were mostly eliminated. The grand result? No noise-deadening textures. A deafening cacophony of noise, every voice reverberating in the dining area. Sitting at uncomfortably tight booth seats (we're average, almost small sized people and my father could barely slide into the booth) you could barely hear each other sitting only across the table from each other. Our server finally showed up a good 5 minutes after we had been seated, and it was next to impossible to hear him. Between the speech impediment (bearable) and the low volume he was using, I couldn't hear almost any of his spiel about the new menu items, aside from ""so would you like to start with an appetizer or some drinks?"" Took another 5+ minutes to get two waters and a DrPepper. We asked for fries to hold us over until food arrived. Didn't get those for about 20 minutes. All the while, I was watching the presumed manager (the only guy in the place with a colored shirt, embroidered with Red Robin on the breast) stand around at the hostess station, stand around at the bar, stand around behind the bar, stand around at the hostess station. Not helping the hostesses, not helping the bartender while 4 servers waited for drinks. Just standing around, shooting the shtuff, and meandering through like a mindless cloud of fog. To summarize the rest, it took quite a while to get food, fries, our check, etc. and we left miserably disappointed. I felt bad for my stepmom, whose birthday we were there for, because it was pretty unimpressive to say the least.  If you want to ensure you have a good server and good service, ask for Mary. Every time we come to this location and we get her, it goes fantastically. If it's not Mary, it's hit or miss. Honestly, that woman is a saint of a server. She jokes around but she's damn efficient and damn good at her job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holyoke
Dave S.,"Agawam, MA",37,7,3,3.0,1/12/2018,"I don't go to Red Robin much. I want to say I don't know why, but I do know why. It just seems a little pricey for a burger place. While the burgers are better than a typical fast food place, this is still a chain so the food remains only slightly above average. So when I'm in the mood for a burger, I am inclined to go to a local burger joint that offers a better burger for roughly the same price. Therefore, Red Robin seldom enters my consciousness. It's not a bad place and I don't think I've ever had a bad experience at a Red Robin. I just find it unremarkable, which is ironic because this review is nothing but my remarks about Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holyoke

Of the two burger recommendations, royal and Southern Charm, I picked the southern charm. It was delicious and tasted exactly as I expected and the fries were warm which tells me they were freshly cooked and not left under the lamp. Vanessa was also in charge of 3 other tables to which she doted on with ease, even changing the tv station to the Sox game for a customer (big thumbs up!). It was relatively calm for a Monday night but still well occupied. I like that they give out utensils and napkins on a tray. The atmosphere is very clean and the wait staff are properly dressed.

We ordered the onion ring tower which is always a hit.  The onion rings I miss the most in the states because they're whole pieces of onion with yummy crispy coating on them!  These in particular come with a ranch dressing and a cajun dressing.  So delicious! My guy and I both ordered the guacamole burger which came with bacon.  You can have your burger cooked the way you like it and we both ordered out burgers well done.  I usually like my steaks cooked medium, but burgers I don't like to see any pink.  The burgers were perfect and they come with bottomless fries.  I never have ordered more fries, only because I fill up on onion rings before my meal even comes out.  Worth it! The waiter was nice and gave us plenty of time to order and eat before asking if we needed anything else.   All in all, this was an enjoyable experience and should we ever be in the area any time soon, we'll for sure stop in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holyoke
