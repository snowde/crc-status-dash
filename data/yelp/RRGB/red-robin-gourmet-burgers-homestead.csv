Kashiff M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",108,28,48,4.0,1/4/2018,"Significant improvement from the last time we came here. Started out with a short stack of onion rings and ordered a couple salads. The onion rings come with a delicious, tangy Carolina BBQ sauce that is a must try. I ordered the Southwest Sombrero salad, a fancy Mexican Cobb salad and my date ordered a crispy chicken salad. It was better than expected to be honest.  I gave it four stars because it was good food for the value, subtotal right around $25. Looking for a decent burger (or salad) joint with no frills, look no further. Red Robin is your place to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead
Bernadette U.,"Pittsburgh, PA",66,104,104,3.0,9/27/2017,"This is a solid choice for lunch when you're at the Waterfront. Super kid-friendly and if you're a big burger fan then you're all set. My go-to here is the BLTA on a croissant, which isn't as messy as their burgers can be, and ""feels"" healthy since it has avocado. Am I kidding myself with that, maybe? But, my husband and I can enjoy a fairly good meal with our toddler. Would we come here sans kid for dinner, no. But we don't really go anywhere for dinner anymore. Also, servers are VERY friendly, A+ to them!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead
Leigh L.,"Homestead, PA",0,1,,1.0,1/3/2018,"The food itself is decent. Good variety, etc. The service however has taken a downward spiral in the past year or two though. Our latest experience will probably be our last. After waiting 10 min. for a table (not a problem) we were seated at a booth and sat there for 35 min. without a server coming by to get us started with drinks or even a ""We're super busy and we'll be with you in a minute.""  Nope.  Everyone around us that were already there were being taken care of, and we were ignored. Not even a look our way. So we bounced. We were already hungry when we got there and by the time we left, we were hangry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead
Eryn P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",196,91,183,1.0,2/19/2017,"Burgers. If you follow me, you know I love them. You also know that I rarely leave a one star review.  Today's trip to Red Robin was frustrating. I had Mom and Dad with me today, out for a late valentines date.  We were greeting only after my dad said hello to the Hostess. She was too busy blowing up balloons to say hello.  Our server was quickly at our table, and slow to bring the wrong drinks. My dads a diabetic, and she brought him sweetened peach tea, after he asked multiple times if it was unsweetened. Whatever. She eventually got it right.  She takes our order from memory. (She also forgot to introduce herself, so she's fortunate that her name isn't smeared throughout this review.) I HATE when servers do that. You're not gonna remember everything. Our food comes out and dads fries are on moms plate, mom doesn't have her spicy sauce on the side, and my burger that was supposed to be pink, is well done. There's also only five fries on my plate. So, I placed a reorder.  Ten minutes later, no fries. Dads ready for more, too. She's over at the bar, on her phone. Sorry, I use my phone a lot, but never in front of the people I work with, or does it deter me from doing my job. This girl was Candy Crushing something serious when I walked over to the bar, and asked about the fries. ""Oh, I didn't know you wanted more!"", was her response. Again, whatever.  The manager comes out with the fries in what seems like a millisecond. He tosses them on the table, ignores our empty drinks and goes away with no interaction.  I always wonder why you wait for an eternity here. They're never busy. Their parking lot is basically just overflow for Mitchell's.  I'll say it a third time, as never go back to homestead, whatever.  Happy Eating, Just not here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead
Stephen R.,"Cleveland, OH",50,52,58,3.0,11/20/2016,"This chain has quite the assortment of burgers and sandwiches. I signed up for their birthday club and I rarely come here outside of my birthday month when I receive a free burger. Their ""bottomless fries"" make for quite the challenge and it's fun to see just how many servings you can get through.  The only problem is that I've always had an issue with the servers coming back in a timely manner, so I rarely get my fill of fries before I reach the limits of my patience.  They're making an effort to modernize their restaurant, so many functions such as ordering drinks, ordering appetizers, and paying for the tab can be done from a tablet posted at the table. This feels very impersonal at times and I would prefer to stick to the old-fashioned way of doing things but I can appreciate the attempt.  With the many options here, I've been able to try something different each time and I've always been satisfied. Their drinks seems overpriced in relation to their food pricing, but I assume they have to make their money somehow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead
Casey K.,"Seattle, WA",191,183,776,2.0,12/4/2016,"I'm writing this as a review to my future self... Hi Future Self, This is Past Self. Did you just drive into the Red Robin parking lot? Then turn around and find somewhere else for your meal. ""It's convenient,"" you might say. Or ""everywhere else has a longer wait."" Don't let this discourage you, you CAN have a way better experience somewhere else. You will undoubtedly walk in and wait at least a few minutes, only to be brought to a table that is either unclean, missing utensils, or something else. The wait staff will arrive only to provide poor service or forget about you all together and you will need to go in search of a team member or manager to help you in another part of the restaurant. When you finally receive your food you will be underwhelmed and left empty, sad that you ultimately did decide to have your meal here. ""It's really not that great,"" ""I don't know why we came here,"" you'll say to yourself. Future Self--I implore you, go somewhere else and get lured in by the bottomless fries.

This location is close to my house, so we have occasionally ordered take out from here or dined in when everywhere else was really packed. The service has always been really great. Their take out here is awesome- we ordered the burger with bottomless fries and since we weren't dining in, I asked if we could have extra fries on the side. Without hesitant, they said yes and we received two orders of fries. Pretty awesome.

Paul H.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,77,1,1.0,4/1/2017,"I've been twice. The garden burger was uninspired. They need to find a better source for their buns. The caesar salad (either the ""Mighty"" size or the smaller side salad) was pretty lame: two times too much dressing. The server's attitude seemed to be that quantity takes priority over quality (they kept asking my friend if he wanted refills of french fries (I tried one, found it disappointingly soggy, and had no more).

Ordering from an iPad -esque screen  does not provide the initial relationship with the server. I had to raise my hand for a drink. I'm not an obnoxious customer, I promise! It's just that I need a drink! Isn't that server 101? There were so many people standing around tonight (not getting me a drink).

Darae C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",62,107,101,3.0,4/24/2016,"Sooooooooooo.... I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants, but my family seems to love them. Being my brother's birthday and not wanting to go against the general consensus I met my family down at this Red Robin for lunch on Saturday. The hostess was generally unhelpful due to half my party already being seared and her just sort of shrugging and not leading us back to the table. Luckily my brother is hard to miss so I was able to find him easily.  We started off with a few apps: onion ring tower and pretzels with beer cheese. We would have also had the hummus but unfortunately they were out. The onion rings were standard--crunchy and onion-y. Breading didn't totally fall off which is always nice. The pretzels were piping hot with a crispy exterior and a soft center with not too much salt. That is how I prefer my pretzels so I was pleased. The cheese dipping sauce was very strong and overpowering. I'd skip it, but my family seemed to really like it.  My main burger was something with Bleu cheese, onion straws and some unfortunate tasting orange sauce. The sweet potato fries made up for it, but I found the onion bun + Bleu cheese to be a not so good combo. My sister had a similar complaint about her Southern Comfort burger, saying that there were entirely too many flavors competing and none of them complimented each other.  Someone else had the 4 cheese melt and honestly I'm bummed out that I didn't get it. It was a grilled cheese with the perfect amount of cheese, perfect crispness, and excellent bread. 10/10 would get it again.  For dessert we tried the croissant donuts. They were warm and yummy, but not worth $8.99 per order. I'd rather go to Dunkin.  Though the place was decently full for 2pm, our server was prompt, friendly, and quick with refills. I liked being able to pay at the table with cards instead of having to have them run back and forth processing everything. This place is not my first choice for chain restaurants but I'd choose it over Applebee's any day of the week.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead
Yamishizen M.,"Hampton Township, PA",107,49,246,1.0,6/27/2016,"Honestly not sure why people are so addicted to this chain. I've avoided this chain since my visit awhile ago, and with good reason. To start off, we went around 9pm, to find ourselves waiting for a table. We were told 15 minutes and it took 30, which is fine, since sometimes things come up. We got the onion rings, which were pretty good. Kind of a comfort food, nothing particularly that someone would crave for, but not bad. Took 20 minutes or so to arrive I do believe.  I ordered the garden burger with a side of endless fruit. We had several endless fries as well. Now, where to begin. Service was s-l-o-w. The garden burger was cold, dry, and the patty was beyond consumption, literally. It had massive bites taken into it, and was hard as a rock.  My endless fruit was fruit preserves, likely because nothing there is fresh, and was never refilled. In fact, none of the fries were refilled without taking several minutes to wave down the servers, which were not particularly attentive.  The sweet potato fries were terrible. Not only were they soggy and cold, but we sent them back 5 times to have the same disappointment. We told them this to only have them say ""they get cold fast"".

Denny V.,"Pittsburgh, PA",50,153,272,1.0,11/23/2015,"I wanted to like this chain, I really did... but after disappointing visits to the Mt Lebanon location (soggy fries in greasy drippy paper cones), to Settlers Ridge where we were the first table seated but it still took almost 40 minutes to get our burgers and even then they missed the most important ingredient of my Ghost Pepper Style Burger (then delivered it in a portion cup on the side) to my most recent visit to this Waterworks/Homestead one- I GIVE UP...!   First off- it was a Tuesday evening and it wasn't crowded.  We were seated pretty quickly and offered menu's by the hostess.  The waitress came by a second or 2 later and asked us if we were ready to order.  WHAT?  We didn't even get drinks yet.  We told her we were going to look over the menu but could she please get us 2 tall Coors Light drafts.  Seeing the bar from our table I noticed that there wasn't a bartender behind it.  There wasn't any customers seated there so I guess that's 'protocol'.  Anyway, our waitress goes away with our drink order and goes behind the waitress station to put our order in.  She comes back about 10 minutes later ( after my wife & I each alternately used the washroom & washed up) and asks if we're ready to order yet.  I ask her if they're still doing the Tavern Tuesday Deal and she says ""No, they stopped that weeks ago"" which I know is a lie because I get the e-mails every Tuesday Morning.  I asked her about our drinks and she says, ""I have no idea what's taking your drinks so long..."" which I reply, ""It's probably because you don't have a bartender over there...""  She shakes her head and walks away.  Still no movement over to the bar so I get up & walk over there myself.  No one seems to notice me and just as I am prepared to grab 2 glasses off the bartop to fill them myself- a Bartender appears...!  She asks if she can help me and I tell her I'm at a table 'over there' and ""...I've been waiting for beers for over 15 minutes with an empty bar...""  She pours my beers and I return to the table.  The waitress comes by about 5 minutes later, sees the beers, doesn't say a word, and keeps walking.  Our burgers come out about 10 minutes later, accompanied by their 'bottomless fries' which amount to 9 fries on my wife's plate (in a silly cone) and 11 on mine.  WTH...?  I immediately requested a second batch.  At least at the Settlers Ridge location- they brought out the fries when they were ready and didn't leave them sit there to get cold & soggy while the burgers cooked.   This experience was another Red Robin let-down... You just can't get it right... 3 visits... 3 Strikes... You're out.  I'm sorry that it has to be like this as I LOVE hamburgers... Btw.

Such a waste of good meat that could've been formed into a nice meatball in a heaping plate of spaghetti and meatballs.

Aeryn N.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,10,,1.0,9/18/2016,"Not worth it. I went to this Red Robin yesterday with 2 other people. Upon arriving, the host seated the group before us then disappeared for around 5 minutes. Honestly, that was a sign. That was a 5 minute sign to leave that we just ignored. Upon coming back she was rather disdainful. She proceded to seat us in the bar area though one of the members in our party was obviously under 21. We requested another seat, and though the resteraunt was not very crowded she sat us at a small table towards the outer aisle underneath a large light. When we went to order our drinks (The best thing about this meal) the waitress placed our silverware on the table. It appeared to have water stains and bits of muck on it, so we requested new kind. To this she responded ""Well they all kinda look like that...Sooooo. I'll try to find you the cleanest ones."" That's not exactly an excuse. At this point i was seriously questioning the cleanlinest of this resteraunt. Despite that, i went on to order. We started out with 2 flavorless apps (These zuchini sticks and mini pretzels... I do not recommended.) Then we went on to order our burgers. I've had much better, I'm not sure why people rave about this place. After paying for our check suddenly the waitress ran back to inform us that we had recieved the wrong check. She handed us a much higher one then proceded to hover in the area until we payed. Overall, i regret not going somewhere else. I could have had a better lunch at Mcdonalds",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead?start=20
Kimberly T.,"Downtown, Pittsburgh, PA",735,645,2146,3.0,8/10/2015,"I had not eaten at Red Robin for a year. Their quality of food seemed to go downhill. This past Sunday my oldest son and I decided to give it a try.  The first thing we noticed was that the entrance had been redone and had more seating. I also noticed that their tag line is ""Burgers and Brew"" which is a good since Craft beers are what people are looking for these days.  We were seated in the bar area. It also had been remodeled. I loved the huge lighting fixture made from beer bottles.  I ordered a Cobb Salad with no tomatoes. It was supposed to come with Garlic Toast. The salad was good but the piece of chicken was small. It looked like a lunch portion not a dinner portion. The 2 pieces of Garlic Toast were the size of bread you use for Brushetta.  That was disappointing.  My son ordered a Royal Burger with fries. He enjoyed his burger and asked for a refill of fries.  Our server was friendly and attentive.

Chip R.,"West Mifflin, PA",31,199,759,1.0,4/13/2015,"The server was nice and all but the service leaves a lot to be desired. I took a seat at the bar after looking for a stool that didn't have the previous customer's dirty dishes and napkins.  There wasn't any so I sat in front of a dirty dish and glass for over five minutes before the area in front of me was bussed and I was offered a menu and a beer.   It took an unusually long time for my Pig Out Tavern Burger to arrive and when it did, the bun was all soggy. The burger tasted okay but ""okay"" is about as good as it gets. Definitely not worth $8.45.  I wasn't in the mood for fries tonight so I substituted broccoli and that was a bit over done and slightly mushy.  The best I can say for Red Robin at the Waterfront is that it sports a full bar but the craft beers here are limited. I was there for about 45 minutes and during that whole time, the bar wasn't bussed once and I dined next to a used empty glass.  This place is either severely understaffed or miss managed (or both).

Server was pleasant but not good - incorrect drinks, never brought requested condiments, waited extended amounts of time for drinks, etc. Food was worse - we ordered our burgers ""Medium"" and both received burgers that oozed blood when cut in half. Asked for replacements and waited 25 minutes and once new food arrived found the burger patties to be burnt on the outside and cooked thru to cardboard consistency on the inside. French fires were also a mix of cooked ok and slightly undercooked with a few that were still cold inside and barely thawed. Manager came to table and said he would take one meal off the check and said he was told we wanted ""Well Done"" burgers.

Hannah M.,"Brentwood, PA",17,56,46,4.0,12/12/2014,"It's been at least a year since the last time I was at a Red Robin, so it was practically like going in for the first time after so long.  The service was excellent. Our server was very quick, friendly, and genuine. God bless anyone working at a service job at the Waterfront during the holiday season that can even fake a friendly attitude, much less be genuinely sweet. It was refreshing (not that I even can blame the grumpy servers at this time of year). Our food also came out unbelievably, especially for a burger place. It usually feels like forever for your food to come out at a place like this because you have to wait for all the burgers to be cooked just right. I honestly didn't even believe it was our food.  If you don't know, Red Robin is known for its burger selection. They've got a lot of interesting choices that include chicken and vegetarian options. I got the Chili Chili Cheese Burger. It's no secret that I love pretty much chili cheese anything. I asked for no pink in the middle. The burger was cooked perfectly. It wasn't overdone, but there was no pink. It was tender and flavorful. On the burger was chili and cheddar cheese (obviously), raw red onions (which I could have done without. They didn't add much flavor, and the chunks were a little big so it added a weird crunch to the burger. I'm also not a huge fan of raw onions. So I may be biased), and a chipotle sauce. The burger was much spicier than I anticipated. It wasn't an overwhelming heat. It was more of a flavorful warmth. Though, be warned, if you don't do well even with mild-medium heat, I'd stay away from this one. The burger was around $11, but I definitely think it was worth the $11.  Red Robin serves bottomless steak fries with all of their dishes. The fries were also cooked perfectly. They were warm and golden, but not overly crispy...or even worse, limp. Our server was wonderful and frequently checked if we wanted more fries.  This isn't the kind of place I'm dying to go back to. I wouldn't say it's anything special considering it's just another burger chain, but they do what they do well. They're fast, friendly, efficient, and prepare their food well. It's definitely a good experience!

I use to love the bottomless fries, but not so much anymore.  That says something coming from a potato lover.   It's like this place feel into a rut and cannot get out.  Like they became too comfortable in what they do and just decided one day that what they do will remain the same and people's attitudes won't change. I do give you big props on the now endless root beer float.  But my burger was kind of blah.  I ordered the Royal Red Robin and thought it'll be great.  I've had it before, and this time I was so underwhelmed I could have stopped on my way home at a fast food joint and been more satisfied.  The egg reminded me of a plastic one you see in a kids toy set.  I'm sure if I were to have dropped it, it would have bounce.  The bacon was undercooked and so chewy that I pulled it off the burger and discarded it.  Even the tomato on the burger was making me want to gag. I remember when the place first opened and I was one of their first customers.  It was pretty amazing and dazzling to be inside, but now I feel like this place has turned into Chuck E Cheese for adults...it's lost its luster.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead?start=20
Judit B.,"Homestead, PA",0,5,5,4.0,3/29/2016,"Normally this location is a five star place. Around 5:30, early in dinner service, we had a twenty minute wait- not too bad.   The burger I got this time, bacon cheeseburger on bun, plus pickles was not as great as one of their specialty burgers. I wasn't feeling adventurous, and for a burger place, I thought a  bacon cheeseburger would be a good place for them to shine. Also, they have a great sense of their customers because any burger can be wrapped in lettuce for low carb or gluten free fans.  Their milkshakes are priced well, I think it was 3.99 and that's great for Pittsburgh.  The bathroom was messy for early on a  Saturday night though.  Finally, they added little computer screens for games you play while you wait for food, but it is also how you pay. We had a problem with our screen, and the waitress helped us, but here's how she did it. She saw our screen had another table's check so she walked over to them, switched screens and gave us the right screen, WITHOUT saying a word to the other table. Shouldn't you explain why you're switching screens, especially if they're playing games and keeping score?   I'll be back because of past visits' success and great location, free parking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead?start=20

I like that there are lots of different options, however I always end up getting the royal or banzai. I'm not sure that the burgers are exactly worth the $10+ but I've never been disappointed with the taste of the food. One complaint I have about my last visit was the burger I got had bacon listed as a topping. Usually when you see this you'd think you'd at least get 2 or 3 pieces, however my burger only had one tiny piece of bacon on it and barely any lettuce, but I didn't complain because I was hungry and it still tasted great.  I'd also like to say service is hit or miss here. Sometimes it's really great, other times it takes a really long time for servers to return to refill your drink or bring your bill or what have you. I also find it really weird how there always seems to be a ten minute wait for a seat even when the majority of tables are empty. I'm guessing they are understaffed.

Larissa G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",124,575,1132,3.0,2/17/2013,"While the Waterfront is a bit out of my way, since it has the theater that's closest to a number of friends, I'm often in the area; my friends are also major Red Robin fans, so I've found myself eating dinner here multiple times before our movie. To be honest, I kind of have a love-hate relationship with Red Robin. It's certainly not my favorite place to eat, particularly during my casual dieting days. Not only are the burgers oversized and/or glazed in some sort of dressing or sauce, all of their appetizers are fried (except for the hummus plate). In short, nothing is waistline friendly unless you're ""that person"" who asks for tons of modifications in their order. I honestly don't think this chain has any interest in developing a lighter option menu, despite these menus' popularity at other restaurants. The only low-calorie item I know of is their skinny margarita, which really doesn't make much of a difference in my calorie intake once the rest of a meal is added in. So that's a big drawback for me. Still, high calorie content or not, I'm a fan of a good burger, and Red Robin can make a reasonably good burger in my experience. Even when I've just shared a meal or nibbled on an appetizer (yes, the same appetizers I complained about earlier - like I said, it's a love-hate relationship) I've been satisfied with the taste and quality of the food given that the place is a chain restaurant.  I've especially been impressed with the servers, who really take the time to check on the table whenever I'm there and to keep us posted on the state of our food in the kitchen (which is very appreciated during the dinner rush, a time of day when any customer can feel forgotten and aggravated). I guess I have to accept what Red Robin for what it is: delicious with a strong dash of dieter's frustration. I'm sure I'll be here again, and, as always, will end up giving in and eating one of their delicious burgers, even if the things are just too much food for little old me.

I had a hard time deciding if this was a Morning Star Farms offering or house made. If it was a frozen patty, shame on them. True burger joints need to show the vegans and vegetarians that Red Robin wants their business and should make an in house patty. The waiter could not answer my question regarding to my inquiring if their meatless burger was house made or frozen. It wasn't bad though.

H.T. N.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,15,,2.0,11/23/2015,"I'm a fan of Red Robin's food. I like their sandwiches and bottomless fries. However, this location needs work in costumer service and management. I've been to this location twice. The first time, I went with someone during the late afternoon/early evening on a weekday. It was not very busy, but it took awhile for someone to take our orders. And then we waited about 15 minutes for our margaritas. We got our food and wanted to order more fries since there were probably only 8 fries on our plates, but our server was nowhere to be found. We later realized that he was both the bartender and the server. Not very practical or efficient. When he finally came to our table and we ordered more, he disappeared for a long while again to make drinks for the people at the bar. There were other servers, so I'm unsure why he was bartending AND waiting tables. Anyway, when he did bring out more fries, there were only 6 fries. Yeah, some ""bottomless""... We ordered more, and after another round of waiting and waiting, another 6 fries came out. Other Red Robins have not been so stingy with their fries, especially if the server is going to disappear for long periods of time and not check on you. We went again on a Saturday night, so we expected it to be busy. But to wait 45 minutes for two sandwiches is ridiculous. Also, we didn't have any silverware for my friend to eat his starter salad, and we rarely saw our server, so we had to wait about 10 minutes after the salad arrived to ask her for a fork. And when we later ordered more fries, our server was extremely rude, almost as if we were inconveniencing her. When I asked her for more, she just sighed and walked away. After a few minutes, she came back and said, ""I put the order in but it's going to take five minutes to cook. Are you SURE you still want them?"" It's strange that she didn't have time to check on us for refills on drinks, silverware, or ask how our food was, but she sure made time to stop at our table and suggest that we should cancel our second basket of fries because it needs to be cooked!

When that layering includes being overseasoned and lacking flavor something is wrong.

I really don't understand how I could have liked this restaurant as a child, especially considering I can get better tasting items out of a can or the freezer.

No, no, no.

We both ordered burgers, nothing fancy, no special orders. I am aware that it was busy and that this might have slowed things down a bit, but REALLY?  We waited 45 minutes from the time we ordered until our burgers arrived.  Where in the heck does it take 45 minutes to cook a burger and slap it on a bun?  After about 25 minutes, our waitress came by and asked if we needed anything and told us our food would be out soon.  10 minutes later, all of the tables around us (including TWO tables that were seated after we were) had been served and we still had no food.  My friend finally went and asked a manager what the holdup was and was told that he would look into it.  Another 10 minutes went by and he brought our food to our table (finally).  No explanation about why it took so long.  No apology. By the time our food came, we were short on time and practically inhaled our burgers.  The burgers were cool and tasteless -- now maybe we felt they were tasteless because we had to eat so fast that it was like we couldn't even enjoy them...   You would expect that after waiting 45 minutes for a burger and fries that the least they could do is serve it warm... We didn't end up paying for the burgers, they took them off our check after we complained a second time.  But no one apologized, seemed sorry in the slightest.  I would much rather have paid for my burger and had it arrive warm and promptly...

Danielle B.,"Rocky River, OH",145,158,28,3.0,4/16/2012,"It's a Red Robin...typical chain restaurant.  On a Saturday night in the Waterfront area, this was the only restaurant with less than a 2 hour wait.  I was a bit weary of that fact, but we were seated within 20 min and the service was great.   They just added a few menu items and their happy hour prices are CHEAP!!!!  I loved the new shrimp taco's and with a Blue Moon - I was happy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead?start=60
Therese N.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,17,3,3.0,4/13/2014,"Red tavern burger and bottomless fries with a side of ranch, tavern sauce and $3 drafts please! only thing I would recommend is cleaner bathroom I've been there during the week and on the weekends too and every time the bathroom is horrendous!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead?start=60
Sharon F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",59,192,70,2.0,1/25/2012,"Went here for lunch today.  What we sampled:  The Onion Ring Tower (delicious I really liked the campfire sauce)  Prime Chophouse Burger (decent, but overall meh as yelp would put it) Steak Fries (I usually hate steak fries to I will say these were great)  Overall it was decent for lunch, but I don't love chains so I would rather go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead?start=60
John K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,4,,2.0,5/11/2014,Very slow to get service here 15min. For drinks 35min. For food. And they weren't even packed there were some empty tables. Just not enough staffing.

Brittney M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",48,40,49,4.0,5/13/2011,"Service (5/5) Our waitress was this really nice older lady with red/purple hair! She actually made the experience better. She was very talkative and gave some great suggestions. She was super honest which I appreciated because most waiters say they ""love"" everything on the menu.  Food (4/5) The avocado burger was good but it wasn't the best burger I ever had. It had this hint of spice that I really liked.  I would probably go back but I would get the hot wings instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead?start=60
Carrie L.,"Pittsburgh, PA",278,198,323,3.0,8/1/2010,"Not too bad; I'd say its geared more towards kids, though. PROS:   Great Staff at all locations, every time that we've gone. Food is okay (not awesome, but good) Endless fries are always a win! Unique atmosphere, sort of retro diner-esque. CONS: It is just sandwiches, but really that's what the restaurant is (to call it a ""con"" is debatable and sort of unfair). Not sure if this is a pro or con, but its very kid-friendly and kid-oriented, IMO The ""salmon"" burger was good (its actually pieces of salmon filet (not ground salmon patties), and I ordered some teriyaki sauce on the side--it was pretty darn tasty! The Roast Beef au jus Sandwich was pretty good too--loads of meat!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead?start=60
Ted E.,"Montgomery, PA",13,54,9,2.0,9/9/2010,"I can't imagine anyone rating this 5 stars.  Three maybe but five? This is a chain burger joint - and the burgers are about 10 bucks.  The staff was attentive.  The food not terrible. And they have ""endless"" fries. If you need to watch the calories -- watch out here.  They put mayo or some other sauce on all the burgers. Probably good for families with kids - if you have the $$$$.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead?start=60
John S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,19,9,5.0,9/3/2013,"I go there all the time and am addicted to their wings. The good: - They have the best burgers bar none. -  Their appetizers are really good. I think they have the best wings in the world and you can have a lot of fun with their onion rings and other stuff. - Endless fries - It usually is pretty fast.  - They usually make it up to you if they screw up. The bad: - Due to their location they usually attract families with kids screaming at the top of their lungs. The parents all find the screaming to be ""cute"" of course and won't dare stop their precious little angels from ruining your dinner. Stay far away from any of the tables that seat 6 people or more. - They used to have problems with running out of french fries and taking forever to make burgers, even though burgers were the only things they made. They have been much better lately though. - No sliders. Why? Who knows. - If you order the short stack of onion rings, you get the smaller end. So, you get maybe 2-3 full size onion rings instead of the 6 you should be getting. - Their television's are not well placed. They either require neck pain to watch or aren't possible to watch at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead?start=60
Dan P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,6,,5.0,9/3/2014,"They were really crowded, but we still got seated in a little under the 10 mins wait they said we'd have.  The waitress was really good, kept checking up on us (despite how busy they were), refilled our drinks multiple times, etc.   Been here 8-10 times over the last 2 years or so, plan to keep returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead?start=60
Theresa C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",119,137,35,5.0,8/5/2010,"Bottomless Freckled Lemonade! Free refills! Must get every time you go! The place gets packed on a weekend. Their Royal Red Robin burger is definitely one of my favorite. Burger with fried egg! If you love guacamole, get their Guacamole burger. I love this place because you can basically make your own burgers! You can add guac to your royal red robin or you can add fried egg to your guac burger! Oh, their fries are awesome! Use the seasoning they provide to add some taste. The fries are bottomless as well! And they serve you the burger with half of it wrapped already. It's clean and easy to eat (especially if you are one of those that's too lazy to wash your hands).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead?start=60

I'm usually not very into chain restaurants and I prefer to eat at small local businesses, but I was so happy when I moved here and saw that there's a Red Robin! I'm a vegetarian, and they substitute boca burgers on any of their burgers. The 'shroom burger is awesome! My roommate loves the Whisky River BBQ burger. We crave it. We're junkies.

Mackenzie C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1,33,,4.0,6/29/2012,"The times I have been here I was impressed at the food and service in comparison to a Red Robin I had visited several years ago. We were seated quickly and taken care of by the wait staff. I had the Prime Chophouse Burger and the Burnin' Love Burger on two separate occasions. My food came out hot, fresh, and cooked to my liking. The fries were all newly made.  Because it is a chain, you know going in that you won't be gettin extravagant food, but for a burger & fries kind of meal there are a lot of choices, many of which are good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead?start=60
Bill P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2,63,29,3.0,12/27/2010,"Red Robin likes to portray itself as a casual dining family restaurant, but don't be fooled- the food is just as bad for you as any ""Super Size Me"" fast food joint. Disappointingly, there are virtually no healthy meal options at Red Robin, unlike many of its competitors. Burgers and salads all run around 1000+ Calories by default, NOT COUNTING the ""bottomless fries"" that are included with many meals. You can mitigate the damage, though. Be prepared to ask for no mayo or sauce if you order a burger, and be prepared to ask for the dressing on the side if you order a salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead?start=60
Andrew E.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2,8,,2.0,1/29/2013,"Not impressed. in all fairness, i didn't get a burger, because i had just had one that day and it wasnt my choice to go there.. i had ava""cobb""o salad, my wife had a bbq grilled chicken sand, and my daughter had a turkey burger. all of which were pretty bad. my salad was very soggy, there was about and 8th of an avacado on it, and it was just all around bad. the chicken sandwich was dry, the breast needed pounded a little before grilling because it was huge in the middle and thin on the ends.. bland. the bbq sauce was good at least! the onion straws were soggy and sooo salty. horrible. the turkey burger was the worst by far. i mean i dont even know what they did to make it so disgusting but it was absolutely nasty. i remember going here 5 or so years ago and thinking the burgers were pretty good, so i would suggest getting a burger. dont you dare get anything else! service was pretty good at least.. drinks are good too.. if you could give a place 2.5 stars id go with that.. and for the guy that says the turkey burgers are good, dont take his word for it, a lot of people think edible=good",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead?start=80
Dave P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",85,190,6,3.0,6/24/2009,A chain burger place.  The burgers are pretty good actually. Get the strawberry lemonade concoction they brew up.  It's really good.

Dean J.,"Seattle, WA",97,154,9,3.0,12/3/2008,"Chain hamburger joint.  Wide selection of burgers done well, accompanied by a basket of ""endless"" fries, and any burger can be replaced with a boca patty for a vegetarian option.

Sylvia L.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",15,62,2,5.0,12/6/2010,"My all-time favorite burger joint!  I don't like to eat burgers at McDonald's and Burger King, but Red Robin is an exception.  People say that the best part of the burger is the meat. I have to agree, but there is one more factor that I consider to call it not a good burger, but an AMAZING BURGER. That factor is the...bun. The bun has herbs that makes the bread taste so much better. Plus, it is neither dry no flaky. The bun is baked to perfection.  Did I mention that they have bottomless fries? You can have as much fries as you want. Woot! Ladies and gentlemen, come here if you want to satisfy your burger craves. I recommend the guacamole burger and banzai burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead?start=80
