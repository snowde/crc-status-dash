Tara F.,"Palm Harbor, FL",23,36,30,5.0,8/20/2017,"By far the friendliest staff I've probably ever encountered. The greeter was so wonderful and made sure we didn't wait long. There was an ""Alex's Lemonade Stand"" fundraiser in the entrance and she offered the boys stickers. Our server Kat was super awesome. She brought drinks quickly and our food was hot. Our youngest had a not so fresh freckled fruit salad and she gladly exchanged it for apples plus brought all 3 boys a fry bucket even though 2 of them didn't have fries with their original meals. This is our first time at this location and with service like this, we are sure to return. I wish more establishments had staff like this!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-horseheads
Madeline A.,"Shelton, CT",10,142,159,5.0,5/30/2017,"Stop in very late on a Saturday and was happily seated by the bartender. We were the only ones in the bar area and everyone was cleaning up.  Our burgers were good and (in my opinion) decently priced. I liked how I could get bottomless fruit bowl instead of the fries as a side. The bartender was attentive but not pushy. She asked multiple times if we wanted more fries/fruit. They had a good selection of beers on tap both local and national.  For a chain burger place, it was good. No complaints!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-horseheads
Victoria Ann B.,"Corning, NY",18,7,1,5.0,11/25/2017,Our waitress was awesome! Food was great and would come here again! It's nice to see a restaurant great with food allergies and doesn't act like it's a big deal. I love it here!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-horseheads
Iron Man H.,"Buffalo, NY",4,101,102,4.0,7/27/2016,"I had some kind of jalapeno burger while my lunch buddy had a chicken ceaser wrap. Both were pretty good.

S C.,"Elmira, NY",1,13,,3.0,10/12/2017,"I don't like paying 13-14 dollars for a burger. That said, the double tavern for 6.99 is a great deal with the bottomless fries. Its a really good burger and not expensive. Service can be hit or miss at times.

Steve S.,"Endicott, NY",3,46,50,3.0,9/15/2016,"Great burgers, perfectly pored cold beer with a lot to chose from. We tried the pretzel bites as an Appetizer with the cheddar beer cheese; BOOM they were wicked tasty.   The service was good - the only complaint is the bun fell apart while trying to eat my burger, now that could have been because I had a lot of items on the burger.   Overall - good meal - good service and really cold perfectly pored beer.   A shout out to Tiffany our server was very polite and consistently checked on us.  Thank you Tiffany.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-horseheads

A G.,"Elmira, NY",0,6,,4.0,7/22/2017,"Service was awesome. Our waitress was attentive without being pushy, although she seemed to be reading from the corporate script. No matter because she was always available at the moment we needed her. And the food was great. Perfectly prepared burgers that were not overwhelmed by the toppings....although I would love just a plate of the bacon. We were seated close to the kitchen and I was especially impressed with the staff singing in the background. Maybe consider bringing them out front and not just for the birthday wishes!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-horseheads
Christy F.,"Detroit, MI",15,26,,4.0,12/30/2016,Great family atmosphere . Pricey for a hamburger . Don't come here if you want something beside a hamburger the selection is very small .

Joe O.,"Woodrow, Staten Island, NY",0,58,,3.0,9/12/2016,"Let's start by saying it was a really good burger. Now, let's talk about service. Waitresses would disappear constantly and would bring two different beers and insist it was the same. I am a avid beer drinker and know the difference between IPA and blue moon. Waitress insisted it was the same and it was just bottom of the keg. Have a burger and soda and that's it for this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-horseheads
Barry K.,"Painted Post, NY",135,228,281,3.0,11/3/2014,"My family and I decided to hit up the new Red Robin on Friday night. We tried to call ahead but they don't allow that.  When we got there they said it was a 45 minute wait. The girl took my cell number and said they would text me now and again when our table was ready.  I LOVE THIS!! It allowed us to go wonder around at the shops nearby rather than sit and wait.  Why don't all places do this????  I got the text 20 minutes later that our table was ready and sure enough it was! The place First thing I noticed is they did a great job with the decor of this place it felt very trendy and cool looking. They even had pictures on the ceiling which I enjoyed.  My only complaint is the place isnt very big. I think they will regret that later but I understand building too big will put you our to business. The food We ordered a couple of milkshakes one Chocolate and Nana-Nana-Moo-Moo first thing I noticed is they are huge it comes with a decent size cup but a metal shake glass that will refill it completely again.  The shakes were ok at best the chocolate tastes like Hershey's syrup it was overly sweet and the other was just ok nothing special.  We ordered an onion tower for an appetizer.  They were good nothing special but solid they came with two sauces which were pretty good. I ordered the Black & Bleu burger which was Sautéed, blackened Portobello mushrooms, grilled onions, house-made Bleu cheese sauce and Bleu cheese crumbles on a toasted Ciabatta bun with Dijon sauce. It was a good burger but for 14.29 a bit pricey.  Yes it came with bottomless fries and the sauces you can dip them in are good but unless you want eat a ton of fries it is a bit pricey.  So overall I liked the but Red Robin is priced high for what you get. The burgers are better than most other chains but at the price point it is a tough call for it to be a go to place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-horseheads
Eric P.,"Mansfield, PA",6,43,7,2.0,1/10/2016,"I mean, the burger wasn't bad.  All around though, the place is slow and expensive for what it is. Most of the burgers are over 12 but they serve fries that are absolutely frozen. I opted for sweet potato fries which had a great flavor of salt and nothing else. We can get 2 burgers, fries(hand cut and fresh), and a drink for less than $20 at Five Guys which tastes better and is ready much faster. $5 for some purple lemonade drink. What? It's lemonade and some weird syrup. I don't get it. All that advertising must have paid off because this place is always packed for dinner, but I don't understand why...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-horseheads
Andy R.,"Painted Post, NY",0,5,2,4.0,5/9/2015,"We arrived at 2 pm on a Saturday afternoon and were seated immediately. Our appetizer - onion rings - was brought promptly and our server checked in on us the make sure all was well.  My burger took longer, since it was ""no pink"" Smoke and Pepper - but was delicious. Sweet potato fries were good too. My wife's hummus was tasty and there was plenty of the hummus, veggies and garlic bread/pita. The server checked on us several times.  Finally - we received our check promptly. I hate waiting for the check or credit card payment...  All in all, very positive; will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-horseheads
W T.,"Tenafly, NJ",0,10,,5.0,12/12/2016,"Your basic franchise Red Robin food which was good.  For each entree, we ordered different fries so that we could share in the endless fries.  Teriyaki chicken sandwich was ok although the bread broke up easier not really providing the support for the sandwich making it a messy eat.  Service at this Horseheads location was above my expectations comparing it to others that I've been to, but I unfortunately don't recall my server's name to commend her. They have a few small game chalkboards at the front which I believe are for kids, but we used one and played hangman.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-horseheads
Melissa K.,"Ithaca, NY",0,2,2,5.0,5/30/2016,"I don't go to chain restaurants much, so I didn't come expecting the worlds best food, so my review has more to do with the restaurant itself.  I came in by myself with my three small children, and I was so impressed to how well they catered to kids. From the kids menu with pictures so my kids could order themselves (they're too young to read), the fact that they offered healthy sides of fruit and veggies, down to the kids level sink in the bathroom which I imagine is more for wheelchair access (even more impressive!). Great job accommodating this mom!! Also our server was amazing!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-horseheads
Nancy K.,"Brooktondale, NY",0,28,,2.0,5/23/2016,"Servers are VERY nice.  However, my mac and cheese came out refrigerator cold.  The waitress immediately replaced it for another side and took off the surcharge - good customer service!  Be careful walking in there - the floors were so greasy that I nearly wiped out several times.  And people, when your child is screaming at the top of its lungs for 5 minutes, please don't ignore the kid and hope we will, too.  We won't.  Sorry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-horseheads
Michael A.,"Horseheads, NY",25,12,6,1.0,9/28/2014,"First the good stuff: - Brand new so everything was clean, and surprisingly efficient.   - We were quoted a 45 minute wait, but were seated in less than 30 - Food was very good. Based on the food quality I would have rated higher, but we had a few issues: - The 'endless fries' meant 1 serving, as our waitress never returned and didn't ask when she DID. - The 'endless fruit cup' ... same, but in this case I hailed her down and asked, and it took nearly 20 minutes. - In fact, we were still waiting for the fruit cup and the server was asking if we wanted dessert ... um, no, fruit cup.  And I mentioned the fries at that point, but my wife was done so we got nothing. - No soda refills. BUT ... the worst thing was that after reviewing my bank account I had to chase down an 'error' in what we were charged at the bar. While we waited we got a wine and a beer, and settled up immediately.  The total was just over $12, and I tipped up to $14.  The bank charge was for more than $21!   When I spoke to a manager he looked into it and pulled the original slip and the entry sheet.  My figures were clear and complete - $14 as the total.  BUT ... the entry was for more than $21, with the server giving herself a $9 tip!   Having someone steal from you on your first visit to an establishment is really NOT a good start.  I hate to say that I hope it cost the person their job, but it is unlikely I am the only one she stole from.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-horseheads
David C.,"Horseheads, NY",2,2,,4.0,9/29/2014,"I suspected this when observing the construction of the new building, and my suspicion was confirmed during our first visit... this place is small. Only 17-20 tables/booths in the dining room, with a few more in the bar area. Got a table for 4 of us, and it was tight. A booth may have been slightly better. Arrived at around 5, and the wait was negligible... maybe 10 minutes. Not bad for a new establishment on a Monday night where there is still plenty of 'novelty'. Although the wait was much longer when we left (~6:15), with plenty of people outside. I really think the franchise underestimated the demand in the area. Adjacent, significantly-larger establishments that have been in operation for a while are still experiencing wait times in excess of an hour. However, the Red Robin standby system uses text messaging to your phone if there is a wait (no silly vibrating-flashy device!), so with a little planning, you can get queued-up in the waiting list and 'wander-away' while your wait time passes. As for the food, as good as expected. On-par with other Red Robins we've visited. The gourmet burgers are excellent, and the fish and chips was quite tasty... all at a reasonable price. Local beers on-tap, with a good selection of national brews. Will certainly return, but we'll request a booth next time. Cheers!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-horseheads

Rob F.,"Sayre, PA",0,10,1,2.0,8/16/2015,"Ehh. I've always loved Red Robin burgers and fries, but after our last trip there, it will be a while before we go there again. The floor was so greasy feeling I almost fell heading out. My burger bun was covered in grease visibly shining in splotches on the top bun, and the whole affair was swimming in mayo and could barely be picked up to eat. The waitress asked if I wanted more fries, then said there aren't any, sorry. We had a problem with one of the orders in our group, which happens sometimes, and the manager dropped off the replacement but had nothing special to say; seemed odd that the waitress asked if the manager had spoken with us, as if there was some message we should have received.

Teri C.,"Pine City, NY",4,5,4,4.0,10/11/2014,"I'm going to begin with the positives as a previous reviewer did  I've frequented several red robin locations over the past few years and felt the food was comparable. I also want to be sure they are given a bit of a learning curve as they've been open for approximately 2 weeks.  service was quite good and one great positive was when the server brought our meal, she realized one burger was incorrect. we probably would not have noticed until too late. she was back with the correct burger in seconds making us able to eat our meal together.  staff was friendly and courteous. booths are roomier than table area  If they read this i hope they keep the bus staff away from tables as we had a staff holding a partially full bin right next to my table of food. not particularly pleasant. they need to set up a station and keep bins there.  I would agree with another reviewer that the size of the building is incredibly small making the wait time horrible. we were told 45 minutes and that ended up taking about 75 minutes before being seated.  overall a good experience",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-horseheads?start=20

Glen W.,"Slaterville Springs, NY",0,13,,2.0,1/30/2015,"If you have ever been to a Red Robin where the waitstaff is pleased to have another table, where the manager visits to ask you about your meal, where you get served in less than 25 minutes at 8:00 on a Tuesday, and where you weren't asked by a waitress if one of your children were indeed real, then you will have experienced a standard that far exceeds this plaza trap. Truly, there is a, ""we're all in it together"", attitude that the staff extends to you: Like when you have to go to a job you detest with people you can't stand and put in your hours - just 'get through it and get out' so we can go back to our hillside trailer, put on some polyester fleece pajama bottoms, and try to scrape enough roaches out of the ashtray to roll a new one with and try to forget why you ever went to Red Robin - let alone Big Head Horse Flats anyway.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-horseheads?start=20
