Bern A.,"Houston, TX",119,123,64,3.0,12/1/2016,"Chain, but probably one of the best tasting ones I've been too.  And better service then the others as well. Not that it's perfect. But they do the job. Reminds me of back in California and time spent with friends and family. My favorite is the onion ring tower, bottoml and the campfire sauce.

Allison T.,"Houston, TX",59,25,1,1.0,4/18/2017,"Yeah, not impressed. Intended to go to another restaurant in the shopping center that was unexpectedly closed.  Arrived to Red Robin at 5:55 and explained the situation.  We asked if they could possibly accommodate a party of 12 around 6:30.  Was told it was no problem.  Waited outside and checked back in at 6:30.  Was told they had given away our tables because they were busy and we would have to wait longer.  Asked about how much longer at 7:00.  Was told 30-45 MORE minutes.  The manager walked up and asked me what I expected with a big party on a Friday night and told me they didn't take reservations.  Clearly there's a huge lack of communication in this restaurant.  No one ever apologized or acknowledged they confirmed they could accommodate us at 6:30, just treated us like we were in the wrong and were incredibly rude to us.  Poor communication.  Poor customer service.  Went around the corner to Cafe Adobe who told us we would have to wait 10 minutes and then sat us in 5.  Could have been a disaster on my birthday but thankfully Cafe Adobe saved the day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2?start=20
Mario M.,"Houston, TX",20,4,,2.0,10/15/2017,"I was told sit in the bar area. Took forever to get a drink and to order. Bartender / waiter was too busy chatting with co-workers and checking his phone. Got my appetizer and it was horrible. The chips were stale. The guacamole was old. Order a basic burger. The meat was over cooked, dry and tasteless. Hard to get a refill. Ask for mayo. Never got it.

Marian C.,"Houston, TX",0,5,,3.0,3/17/2017,"Good:  They have a great crispy chicken salad, that they have started serving in a large bowl which keeps the lettuce from falling off the edge of the plate (improvement). Bad:  Every time I order this salad, i have to ask for the garlic bread 4 or 5 times before they FINALLY bring it to the table, often as I am just finishing my salad.  What's the deal with making garlic bread?  It's irritating that this happens every time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2?start=20
Nicole W.,"Houston, TX",0,16,10,1.0,5/18/2017,"This location has definitely fell off.  I used to be a HUGE Red Robin's fan.  I have to admit the last two times I visited this location my burger just didn't taste right.  Today I ordered Sriracha shrimp as an appetizer and I didn't taste any Sriracha.  I was afraid to order another burger so I ordered Cluck and Shrimp, which is basically chicken strips, fried shrimp, & bottomless fries.  My fries weren't fresh.  MAJOR turn off.  Hubby ordered a well done burger & it was more medium than well.  I'm sorry, but 3 strikes and you're out.  I won't be back.   Omg, I forgot to mentioned the sweet tea we ordered.  It was more like colored water.  The manager asked us if everything was okay and we told him the tea was watered down.  I guess the waitress didn't like us complaining to the manager because when she returned with our new colored waters she slammed them on the table and didn't acknowledge when I said thank you.  No worries, she won't get a tip from me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2?start=20

Angelica N.,"Houston, TX",1,8,1,4.0,5/28/2017,I went here with my boyfriend and little sister. The place was not very busy. We order burgers. They taste better than decent and well made.

Tajdid H.,"Houston, TX",46,82,69,2.0,12/25/2015,"Food is decent, service is terrible!!!  One star for refilling my soda without me asking and another for the food being decent. Where they lack is the service and cleanliness of the restaurant.  We were at Marqe on Christmas Day and decided to have lunch here. We walked in and were seated at a booth next to the door to get to the patio. Well, behind me were three bus boys just chatting away, without thinkibg that there was somebody behind them trying to enjoy a meal with his wife.  We decided to move to a booth down the aisle and noticed there was ranch dipping on the ground. I dont mean just a spot, but a handful on the floor. We were there 1.5 hours, and the ranch was there the entire time.  Well, we got to ordering as we were finally able to get some peace and quiet. We ordered the pretzel bites, which were pretty good, but the cheese sauce was bland.  For our entre we ordered a Keep It Simple (medium well) and a Whiskey BBQ with pepper jack (medium). The burgers were juicy, somewhat thick and flavorful. The fries are whatever.  The part that is the worst of our experience... we saw our waitress three times. Once when she took our drink order, next when she brought our drinks and took our main orders, and lastly when she brought our check. We were hoping to order the croissant doughnut things, but without us asking for a check, our waitress decided that we were done and she brought our check. Well RR, I am done with you, and will no longer be dining at your not so fine establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2?start=20

Robert A.,"Humble, TX",3,9,30,4.0,10/6/2016,Always great service at this location!! The food is always great for a decent price!!! My only complaint would be I you order a dinner salad...

I had the California chicken burger, plus and minus a few of the original toppings. as i was making it fit my dietary needs. They have a few different type of buns, including WHOLE GRAIN. The entrees all come with bottomsless fries and they also servce sweet potato fries. I had a couple bites on my bfs burger also. His was great. They get creative with thier toppings which i like.

Slightly pricy but you get unlimited fries which I like to sneak into the theatre instead of buying popcorn haha. Interior is clean and restrooms usually clean. Why I didn't give 4-5 Stars is sadly the inconsistency of the service. Some trips the service is excellent food comes out fast with drinks and fries refilled without having to ask. Other visits you're empty on both for a good 5-15 minutes even whole asking for the refill. Understandable when busy but the latter happened when it was barely packed.

Danielle S.,"Houston, TX",430,763,72,3.0,12/20/2013,"Fifty-cent gluten free bun.  That's really all Red Robin did to make this a repeat destination for us, especially when we're en route to see a movie at the nearby Edwards.  Some places charge as much as $2 for the same swap, so when I saw the bill at the end of our first meal here, I was sold.  And the bun itself actually tastes pretty good and has a more standard texture than other GF buns we've tried. So, having said that...let's be real, this isn't fabulous foodie dining.  The food is reliable, in that generic chain-y way, but the service has always been cheerful and they do a great job of having information readily available about allergens in their food.  Husband's meals always come with an allergy alert and the kitchen knows not to put any of the seasoning on his fries, so he avoids the ""inner turmoil"" associated with back-of-house oopsies.  As it were. Again, nothing here is going to blow your mind, but the husband missed burgers pretty bad, and for fifty cents more than normal, he can have a regular experience.  I'm okay with going here once a month for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2?start=80

I thought it would just be the average sandwich...but my God out was so much more! The slaw on the bread is perfectly crunchy and not wet. I couldn't really taste the tarter sauce and that's ok. Then you get to the crispy fish!!! My do Jesus!! It crunched every time I took a bite. The cod was light and the battery was light and crunchy.

When my son's fried fish finally came (15 min after everyone else got their orders) I cut it open so he would not get burned, the fish was raw!

Tyler N.,"Houston, TX",2,18,7,1.0,9/11/2014,"The management in this place is not great. I can tell by my experience here that the entire staff has poor connection with each other. The manager is also very rude. If I could give this place zero stars I would. My experience was so terrible I know if I wrote about it I'd rant way too long. Basically, the manager told me ""if I was smart I wouldn't have asked to speak with her."" The problem at hand was so minor, but she completely took it out of control. I've worked at Denny's before. I know customer service and how hard it can be to serve. I was not acting rude in any way. Maybe even too nice, but the manager for sure brought out my devil horns.

The hamburgers are run through a salamander that gives a very standard product but it looses some of the character that an actual cook with a grill can give.  This Red Robin stands out a bit unique to me because I think it is probably the best option for dinner if you are going to the theater.

It's not super huge, but it fills you up big time. I ordered the garlic fries, I wouldn't eat that on a first date lol it makes your breath stinky. They have this seasoning you can add to your burger and or fries. I only tried a little on my fries and it was great.

Chris P.,"Houston, TX",179,39,41,3.0,6/4/2016,This is the first time I've been back to a red robin for a few years now. The place looks nicer and the menu definitely got revamped a bit. You no longer get a gigantic laminated menu but now you get a book.  I got their limited time berserker x burger. I guess it's to promote the new xmen movie. The burger overall was only ok. Patty was cooked well but didn't have much seasoning to it. The sriracha onion straws didn't really have that much of a spicy kick to it. However the aioli was tasty. They now give you dipping sauce for their bottomless fries. They have this one sauce that kind of tastes like chik fil a sauce. We also got the the nana nana moo moo shake.

However, if you are looking for a big burger like Fuddruckers or Pappas, etc. this is not the place for you. They do have bottom less fries, which make sure you ask for a basket when you order our burger because they bring out three bites with your burger and then by the time the next round arrives you are finished with your burger!

Dave O.,"New Smyrna Beach, FL",655,2375,8209,3.0,4/5/2014,Great Burger and Beer selection! Came in late afternoon on 3/2 the place was about 10% full we chose to sit at the bar and enjoy a few select drafts the glasses aren't frozen but they are chilled and the beer was ice cold. My beer of choice lately when I do drink beer has been the St. Arnold's and it didn't disappoint again. Started off with a bowl of the clam chowder it was meh I'm sure it comes in a bag from some food service supplier but it okay I don't think I would do it again but we really stopped in for a burger. Of all the choices I decided to keep it simple and went with a plain old fashion bacon cheese burger loaded with pepper-jack cheese. It was cooked to order medium and came out perfect. The restaurant was clean and the staff was very friendly I've forgotten the bartenders name but she was great. Since they weren't busy she carried on some good conversation while keeping busy doing her required tasks. We really enjoyed our meal and for a hamburger this place is okay I still prefer some of the up and coming burger places for the food but this place was convenient and they did a nice job I would come back if in the area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2?start=40

Kinda like a bad vid of harajuku girls. Our waitress, she was tidy and came around to check on us often. The wait time for a burger is easily 15 minutes. Getting drinks from the bar is about 5-8 minutes. Anyway, got the southern charm burger well done. Had a very juicy and flavorful pattie topped with BBQ sauce cheese, caramelized onions, bacon, arugula and a bit of celery and a sprinkle of brown sugar on toasty chibatta bread! Soooo good! I got sweet potato fries and tried the garlic herbed fries. First batch with burger the fries were cool. Second batches(refills) they were piping hot! Yey~! Also sipped the fire ball/bomb peach drink. Not a fan of how it was too sweet but friend ordered it and liked it. Overall good experience.

The manager even walked around to make sure everything was good. At that time I've inly had the fries so I told her it was excellent. When I got to the burger, it wasn't what I expected. I had ordered a bacon cheese burger with pineapple. The problem here is that the burger was supposed to be gourmet, yet my bacon was chewy. If you're a bacon lover like me you want your bacon cooked perfectly where it's crispy so u can taste it in every bite. The bacon that was in my burger made me chew and put as I was taking a bite of my burger, creating a hot mess. I wouldn't be back for the burgers.

Jen N.,"Spring, TX",173,21,22,5.0,1/31/2015,"Unlimited fries, drinks and a delicious burger. What more can you ask for?  Almost all specialty burgers comes with a side of bottomless fries. You can choose from garlic fries or regular fries. If you don't want a side of fries you can always switch it to a side of broccoli, fruits or something else. If you wanted onion rings then it would just be 1 serving. But since I'm a college student, you know I'll be getting my money's worth.  I got the chili chili burger with ghost pepper sauce on the side. This sauce was AMAZING, if you like spicy ask them for this on the side. I dipped my fries in it as well and it was heavenly. But note that I'm one of those people that would order the spiciest wings at Buffalo Wild Wings that usually come with a label saying ""caution: may irritate skin."" We also tried the garlic fries, but they were okay. Just get the regular fries and add some of Red Robin's special seasoning on it.  One word to describe the customer service, perfect.

Our drinks were empty and my husband's burger came out without the extra patty he ordered. Shouldn't you check that before you get to the table?

Kristi M.,"Katy, TX",0,10,,1.0,11/9/2015,Went to Red Robin for the first time ever during lunch today. It was not packed or full by any means. We were seated right away but for some reason the service was SLOW for really no one being in there. They were definitely I feel staffed quite well for not many customers.  We ordered an onion tower and it was ok. I think it was a little too crispy and tasted a little like it was cooked in old grease or something. It was decent though. We ordered our food which was a whiskey burger and then some snack buffalo bites. It took quite awhile to get the food out. I started to look and could see the buffalo bites sitting (and not under the heat lamps either) for a good 7-10 minutes before one of the gentleman running food brought it out.  The bites were not appetizing AT ALL. They were overcooked and the extra sauce they brought with it looked awful. The sauce was separating and looked like it had a layer of oil on top. We even tried mixing it and it didn't work. I showed the waitress and asked for another one and the second one she brought was just as bad. Needless to say it wasn't touched. We were done eating and sitting there waiting for her to come pick up the checks and she just stood there behind the bar on the phone with another employee until I was about to get up and bring it to her. I don't really see the reason why the service was so poor and the food when it wasn't even that busy.

And when I recieved it it was medium.  not medium well. not even close to being well done. AND bc I hate raw hamburger meat I sent it back. Well After everyone at my table was finished they brought my burger and not only was it now cold but it was med well not as reddish pink but still with a reddish hue and I couldnt even finish a quarter of the burger.

Here's a play by play of my experience at Red Robin. Got to the restaurant with my friend, and a wait to be seated; about 15 minutes. Waited about 8 minutes before a waiter came. They looked short staff, and very busy. And yet, some tables dotted the place vacant. We've just ordered, my friend now decides to see how long it would take to fill up his water, and a countdown begins... We are now at 12 minutes. I have my margarita. Supposed to be one of the best, but could use more tequila. (That's just me tho, I like a strong margarita). Oops! Someone almost slips on some water in the restaurant! Our waiter (yes) is moping it up. 15.30 minutes... 21 minutes (waiter spotted in distance)... 24.30....waiter comes up, says the ticket was lost, but now found. They are know just putting in our order. Are you kidding me... Oh, btw, water still empty (update: 27.25) and I ordered a shot of tequila to put in my drink. 31.30. Shot of tequila arrives. We're hungry. Food!! 35.30 Water!!! 38 flat. And the burgers are pretty good. Things are coming quicker, which is nice. Used the bathroom, no paper towels, had to use toilet paper to wipe hands. Bathroom needed some TLC. Are the employees using this bathroom too? Boy... That's disgusting. I'm ready to leave. Check comes, they did discount us a bit for the ""lost ticket"", that was cool. But really, the meals are free remember lol, so it doesn't matter. To conclude, not a good experience for my first time at Red Robin, which I was thinking to take my fiancé.

Belly G.,"Houston, TX",616,836,4932,3.0,4/1/2017,"Red Robin serves decent burgers. Personally, their appeal to me is because of a couple of things: bottomless steak fries and bottomless strawberry lemonade. If this is your first time here, their menu can be overwhelming. First thing to do is to see their burgers 411 page so you know what's what. They have three kinds of burgers: Angus meat, regular meat, and tavern style (smaller size). Despite the description and the pictures that you see on the menu pages to make it sound like their burgers are as big as a mammoth, their burgers aren't actually that big. I usually always enjoy my burgers when I come here, but their prices are pretty high. For example, my Smoke & Pepper burger cost $13.99. I added a fried egg on top for an additional charge making it a $15 burger!! For that kind of money, I could have gotten a real delicious tasting burger from Stanton's City Bites and then some. My bill for the one burger + strawberry lemondae ($5!) + tax and tip was well over $25. Yeah, that's not going to do it for me. On the flip side, the service was not too bad and you can pay for your meal using one of those tabletop machines. This restaurant is also conveniently located right across from the Marq'E theater. On the down side, it's freezing in here.

I came here two weeks ago and had great service by a waitress that came by every so often to check up on us and make sure our drinks are refilled. Today, our service was not the best.

The burger menu is very extensive and after some reflection I ordered a Southern Comfort Burger. The photo showed a desirable 1/2 pound burger with caramelized onions, bacon and lettuce.  The kitchen will no longer prepare the half pound burgers rare. They said they'd do mine medium. What was served up was a very dry, very well done meat patty that was devoid of any savory goodness.  The bun was the next disappointment. My burger served on a   Chibatta roll that was chibatta in name only. The bread was soft and had the texture of an ordinary hamburger bun. Baking a roll in a square shape doesn't make it chibatta. During my meal the bun completely disintegrated making a mess of my hands.   The endless steak fries were good provided they were served hot from the oil.   The margaritas were, however, very good.  I'd certainly consider having those again.

On my last visit, service was just terrible.  My girlfriend ordered her burger well-done, but it came out roughly medium and she had to send it back.  I ordered my burger medium and it came out well-done (probably got the orders crossed because she never bothered to write it down), but I just gave up and ate it.  Another person in our group ordered sweet potato fries and got regular fries.  She literally managed to mess up three of the four orders at our table. We ended up requesting our checks early and getting the hell out of there.  We had originally planned on having milkshakes for dessert, but with how poor the experience was,  The one thing this place does consistently bad is apply discounts.  I had a $2 off offer on the aforementioned previous visit and it wasn't taken off my tab.  I had a $4 off $10+ coupon on the most recent visit and it similarly wasn't discounted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2

Stephanie R.,"Austin, TX",4,13,,2.0,7/3/2014,"Beware of Bartender! I'm a cocktail consultant so I'm very serious about the contents of the cocktails I consume. I like to get what I pay for and at the very least, I expect to get the ingredients that are listed on the menu. I watched the bartender make my drink and he swapped ingredients. I ordered a Tropical Mai Tai- the ingredients listed on the menu are: A blend of Myer's Dark and Bacardi Select rums, Orange Curaçao, fruit juices, grenadine & sweet 'n sour.  Rather than adding Bacardi the bartender used Ron Rio- which is a very cheap rum with poor quality and gives a hangover. I called the bartender out on it and asked that he make the drink with the ingredients listed on the menu and he was abrasive. I asked to speak with the manager and he came over and justified why they used cheap liquor and said that he didn't know why the menu didn't say Ron Rio instead of Bacardi because that's what they use. I told him that we both know why Ron Rio isn't listed because no one wants to consume it, therefore the drink wouldn't sell. The manager said he would instruct the bartender to make the Mai Tai the way I asked, but the drink never came. I eventually completed my meal and asked for the check, of which I was charged for the Mai Tai. I, then, requested the charge be removed and left the establishment. Burgers are awesome!

They have two veggie patties - one vegan (boca burger) and one vegetarian (morningstar, I believe). Decent beer selection and bottomless fries!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2?start=120
Chris W.,"Houston, TX",0,7,,2.0,11/30/2013,"Food is as expected, sometimes a little salty. My family and I frequently go to this restaurant, but have seen the service drop with each visit. Could be new staff, but, that's where training should come in to help. Saw our server busily watching sports game, or talking when not tending to tables (more tv than work).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2?start=120
Kim W.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,11/26/2014,This was horrible. We were seated at our table which had two baby roaches crawling on it!! In complete disgust we walked out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2?start=120
Mayra V.,"Houston, TX",19,12,,5.0,5/5/2013,"After a horrible experience at another restaurant Red Robin restored our faith in waiters/waitresses. Our waitress Dani did an awesome job waiting on us, we were seated and with our food in less than 20 minutes! She never let out drinks go empty and was always checking on us.

Ben P.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,4.0,10/13/2014,"We discovered this location a couple of months ago and have been pleased with the service and food each time.  The burgers, bottomless fries and root beer floats are all great.  Salads are also fresh and onion rings fun too.  Service is usually good as well.  I would recommend it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2?start=120
Lauren J.,"Houston, TX",66,254,6,3.0,5/6/2009,"I am on a somewhat lax quest for the best hamburger around. I had never been to a Red Robin, but needless to say, I am still questing. Good fries and a good burger (although the guac on my burger had some crazy and seriously sporadic kick to it). I would definitely go back, but I wasn't really salivating over it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2?start=120
Claude K.,"Houston, TX",12,75,27,4.0,10/28/2009,"The Red Robin song is really annoying, yet catchy at the same time. Perhaps that's what pushed me to venture into this hamburger joint with my sister and her boyfriend (yes, I was the third wheel. Don't mock me.) My sister and I split the Banzai burger while he went with the Bleu Cheese burger. The Banzai burger had hamburger meat with teriyaki sauce, grilled pineapple rings, mayo, American cheese, and lettuce. Weird? Oh no. It's amazing. The meat is so juicy, just like how hamburger meat should be like. The pineapple rings and the teriyaki sauce added sweetness while the mayo added a bit of tang. The combination of it all = one killer burger. Also, it's very filling. Eating just half of it will fill you up. If not, then the endless steak fries will. They're not greasy or hard- they're perfect. Soft on the inside, crispy on the outside. Their Red Robin seasoning (next to the ketchup) complements them well.  Our host was pretty friendly and didn't seem annoyed when I asked him some stupid questions, i.e.: Which one's your favorite? Is this any good? Blah? Blah blah blah? So stop by if you're craving an artery-clogging burger. Good service and good food equals a happy tummy to me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2?start=120
Judy N.,"Houston, TX",51,4,,5.0,3/14/2014,"The 3 new Black Angus burgers at Red Robin are FABULOUS! The D.G.B. (damn good burger), the Smoke & Pepper and the Black & Bleu Burgers each are wonderful.  The Black & Bleu is a fork and knife burger, the Smoke & Pepper is spicy and mouth watering and The D.G.B. stands alone as a really special burger.  All are served with Bottomless Steak Fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2?start=120
Gracie R.,"Houston, TX",12,62,22,4.0,3/27/2009,It has one of the best mushroom burgers!  A little over priced but worth it.  Plus you get bottomless steak fries!!  The waitstaff are usually friendly and prompt.   Overall the place rocks!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2?start=120
Shanon M.,"Houston, TX",6,40,,3.0,3/22/2011,"I give it 3 stars because the service was fast and the waitress was actually friendly. The food was just ok...I mean, I ate better burgers in my life. That cramberry mixed drink was actually good.

Sherri D.,"Houston, TX",0,62,,2.0,3/10/2014,"It has been years since I've been to this Red Robin & now I remember why. Food is average, similar to food at a Chili's or TGIF's.  We ordered the burger w/egg all the way & the whiskey bbq burger. Both burgers had charcoal tasting burnt spots on them...yuk. Fries were good & hot. Kettle chips w/french onion dip were tasty.  Best part of the whole experience actually, was the service.  Thomas was an excellent server!  Might return if I had a coupon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2?start=120
Andrew D.,"Houston, TX",186,79,1,1.0,7/13/2010,"Came here several years ago with a group of people. The check had been split. There were about five of us, and two were paying in cash. The rest paid with credit card. As two of us handed the waitress our check and cash, on top of the other the rest of checks and corresponding credit cards, we specifically asked for change for the cash. She looked down at it, and said sure. She came back and said that we were short on the bill. The amount happened to be the amount we had given her cash for. We said that we had already given her the money. She claims she never got any cash from us. The manager came out, and the waitress insisted we never gave her money. The manager, instead of trying to appease us and perhaps clinging onto the small chance we'd actually return, made us pay again. Lovely experience. You couldn't pay me to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2?start=120

Tim T.,"Houston, TX",13,60,,4.0,6/2/2010,"I love Red Robin. Bottomless is my favorite word. Freckled Lemnade check. Bacon cheddar mushroom bbq sauce burger check. Steak fries with ketchup check. After utililzing the bottomless power to the extreme. 4 cups of freckled lemonade is enough to kill a small child, i was extremely full but pleasantly full. I've always been a fan of Red Robin, I'm just happy that its so close to my house now! Good for my soul, bad for my wallet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2?start=120
Ken W.,"Houston, TX",588,105,,3.0,3/3/2008,"I go to this place like about once a month just to get my burger jones on. The food is so-so and the service is so-so about par with all the other restaurant chains but hey sometimes you want something in between frou frou and mcdees then this is the joint.  I usually get the good ole American Cheeseburger ( I usually get it with bleu cheese though). Yesterday, I rolled the dice and got their Whiskey River burger (the waitress said it was their signature burger. I'm a bit leery when people recommend their ""signature"" this and that). It was alright. I'm not a big fan of the crunchy onion stuff though. Gimme some stinky raw onions anytime. Their all you can eat fries are pretty cool but they seem to come from a bag. My friend bit into one that wasn't all the way cooked though. Overall its a decent place with decent fare.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2?start=120
JIMMY N.,"Houston, TX",206,188,91,3.0,12/16/2007,"On some occasions I have the greatest service in the world and the other times I just have the crappiest service ever.  So its a roll of dice every time I come here.  Anyhow, when I want comfort food and have the craving for fatty burgers then Red Robin is where I go.   I usually order their specialty Royal Red Robin burger (Burger w/ bacon and a poached egg).  Sounds kinda weird but it sure is yummy!!!  It's like breakfast and lunch all in one.  This burger is GENIUS!   The fries are bottomless and seasoned.  The drinks like peach/raspberry tea and the strawberry freckled lemonade are sweet and BANANAS!  However, at times it can be inconsistent.  They are prepared at the bar, and depending upon the bartender your sweet level fluctuates.  You don't really need any appetizers here unless there's something that interests you.  Otherwise, just an entree will fill you up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2?start=120
Jay J.,"Houston, TX",2,32,,5.0,5/12/2008,"Best wings in town, hands down! I love this place. I've came here a couple of times and i must say i love it every time. i usually get the hot wings with steak fries . i must say the have the best wings. They use this spacial sauce for them that separates them from the rest of the restaurants. There steak fries are the bomb! Every table has a bottle of seasoning that i use for the fries, try them with ranch and u will love them!  Oh also they have this freckle lemonade (not sure if i spelled it right)  but its lemonade with REAL strawberry's ! yum  I get about 15 refills no lie!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2?start=120
