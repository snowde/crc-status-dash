Steph D.,"Houston, TX",26,108,6,4.0,1/13/2018,"I've been going to Red Robin since I first discovered one in Oregon about 12 years ago. The thing that really struck me is I wandered in 10 minutes before closing. They not only seated and served me, they were just so cool about it. Since then I've been going to the one on Richmond & Rogerdale way back when the cinema was still there. We have a favorite bartender, Jorge, who always treats us great. And I can still walk in 10 minutes before closing and they will still cheerfully seat me and serve me (to the extent the kitchen is open). Then tragedy strikes! (sort of). Turns out the food allergy that I suspected was to dairy turns out to be (dum dum dum) to gluten. The good news is I can eat ice cream! The bad news is, well, will I ever be able to eat out again? Can I haz Cheezburger? Then I read not only does RR have a gluten free bun, it's the best gluten free bun on the planet! And since their burgers are already par excellence, off we go to RR. And you know what? They're wonderful and I can eat burgers and they're sensitive to celiacs and I can get fries and salad and fruit and all is good in the world. The burger I got was a limited edition, the Chimi Fresco. It was awesome. I can't get beer, but whatever. I'll have ice cream.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston
Emma M.,"Houston, TX",0,5,6,5.0,1/7/2018,I must say the staff were beyond superb. The really know how to make you feel comfortable. The menu is extensive  but they helped you work around what is just right for you . The zucchini appetizer is delicious and their fires were absolutely fantastic. We had a lot of laughs with the staff and recommend it to anyone who want a scrumptious burger and a great atmosphere.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston
Sarah A.,"Westside, Houston, TX",0,1,,2.0,1/5/2018,"Their food is good but their to-go service is terrible. I probably order from them about once a month and do curbside pickup. I truly cannot think of one time they have gotten my order perfect. Missing ranch, no plastic ware, wrong burger toppings... They are also sooo slow. I will select pickup for noon, come in at 12:15, and then still be waiting 10+ minutes. And they're not even busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston
Clint M.,"Houston, TX",391,509,188,3.0,5/25/2016,"I don't swing by here as often as I used to ever since the Tinseltown closed, but this is still a great place to grab a burger on a lunch break, or to hang out with friends.  They've revamped their menu to include premium burgers and ""Tavern Doubles"" (smaller, cheaper options), but at their core they're still a diner with good classic burgers, fries, and milkshakes, plus a bar. The last couple of times I've swung by, I've gone straight to the bar area and ordered there.  The bartender is usually busy with multiple customers, but is quick to take care of everyone.  They're always friendly, and service is usually quick.  The only knock on this place is that they seem to serve a smaller amount of fries every time I come.  I mean, I get that it's unlimited and I can get more, but why use that as an excuse to serve me less up front? There are better burgers in Houston, but if you want a classic place where you can go with a group and also grab an alcoholic beverage (besides a beer), there are few better options in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston
Stacy W.,"Westside, Houston, TX",0,15,,3.0,10/25/2017,"Red Robin is hit or miss.  One week they will be spot on, food perfect great customer service.  Then the next time it takes 30 minutes to get a burger that is undercooked. The new curbside pickup is unorganized and you might as well go inside if you want your food hot (still a 10 minute wait)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston
Jocelyne M.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,3.0,7/30/2017,"This was my first time trying it out, I actually really enjoyed our food. But the service was horrible, the waiter would not come around.  At one point one of the managers I believe since he was wearing a dress shirt had to come and help us with the order. I had to also go to the bar and ask for napkins since they never gave us any. I would recommend the restaurant but at a different location, maybe the service there would be better. Overall the food was great, they serve bottomless fries with your order, even though we weren't able to get more since no one was around. It was delicious, hopefully if I ever come again the service will be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston

Went again with kids, burgers tavern and turkey with avocado with purple lemonades - both kids said way too sweet. I had my salad and wings again.

We had a friendly waitress and she took our orders promptly. The only complaint I have is that it took a little longer for the food to come out. The burgers are pretty good, and I love their steak fries. You can substitute with garlic and herbs fries for additional price (a dollar). I had the lonestar burger and I was definitely stuffed by the end! Couldn't finish all my fries!

Red Robin has really overhauled there menu with plenty of new burger option. The last couple of times I've had the Southern Charm burger and it's pretty good. I tried some of my sister's chicken tenders and they did not taste fresh at all. Service at this location wasn't terrible but also wasn't great, which is crazy because the restaurant was very busy.

To our dismay, we stood and sat for 15 minutes, as their 2 ""Please wait to be seated"" signs instruct, and were never seated. The restaurant was not busy, as we were the only ones waiting to be seated. Servers walked by us several times, looked at us, and didn't say a word. Finally, one server, who had walked past us several times, asked us if we needed help. My boyfriend nodded and said yes, and she just walked away and continued what she was doing. I look over and see 2 other servers hanging out at the bar chatting with customers. We finally had enough and walked out.

Ralph D.,"El Paso, TX",0,12,26,3.0,5/30/2017,"First time visiting RR.  We are from El Paso, Texas and are in Houston for personal reasons.  We've seen commercials on cable tv back home and decided to visit for the first time.  The service was mediocre but the food was great.  Spoke to manager when he sat us down and we told him that it was our first time, he welcomed us and reviewed the entire menu, kudos to him.  Our sever however was not all in and took for ever to refill our drinks and bring out condiments and our bottomless fries.  Very discouraging since the other 2 servers on the floor portrayed the same attitude and energy.  Atmosphere needed some music or tvs since we could of heard the conversations of other patrons if we wanted to.  Overall I would recommend it probably on a weekend with much more livelier servers, we visited on a Monday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston?start=20

Darla G.,"Sugar Land, TX",165,29,23,2.0,3/12/2016,"My family and I have been coming to this location for years and always so pleased with the food and the service. However, in the past six months or so, it's been awful on both counts. The waiters are very slow and not very attentive to our needs and the food just isn't what it used to be. There is never really a crowd, so it seems ridiculous to wait for nearly 40-50 minutes for your food.  I am truly disappointed at the way this restaurant is changing. I have driven the 30 minutes to the restaurant many times - sometimes in horrible traffic, which adds another 15 or so minutes. However, I no longer feel it's worth it.  It's all American food, so there are lots of other choices closer to home. Hopefully they just have a bad management team and will soon change out, so things can get better again. I may try again in about six months to see if that rings true.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston?start=20
Shana H.,"Houston, TX",48,170,86,1.0,3/21/2015,"Came here on a Thursday night and it was pretty empty. We were sat immediately, however it took a good 6 minutes for a server to come and even get our drink orders. When he did, he was not very engaging, and sort of mumbled. Drinks did not take long to get. We proceeded to order when he returned. My bf specifically asked if they had the crab cake burger because the Katy location is always out. He assured him that they had them, and took his order. I ordered a salad, and specified no cucumbers and no bacon. Can you guess what happened? So about 20 minutes go by, no, literally 20 minutes. How do I know? Because I was texting my mother, and looked at my phone to confirm. A manager approaches our table to tell us that they ""looked high and low"" and did not have any crab cake burgers.  Soooo...it took 20 minutes to figure this out? It is CERTAINLY not as if the place was packed - there were about 5 tables filled. And I mean tables of 2 or 3 people... As she walked away with his NEW order, a female server comes to our table telling us that she was now our server as our previous one was leaving....umm ok. As a member of the service industry myself, I thought that was pretty shitty of them, shows very little respect for customers. I've never seen that personally, you always have to wait until your last table leaves, just the way the cookie crumbles... So, as we received our chili, which was the highlight of the night, we kept seeing our first server, seemingly doing nothing. The manager seemed oblivious to our frustration. When sh brought my salad, it had bacon AND cucumbers on it, and while I was super angry I said that I would pick it off. Afterall, I had waited about 30 minutes for my damn food to begin with!! I do not eat pork, and found it to be shitty, yet again, that they got that part wrong. I will CERTAINLY never be back. Shame on you, Red Robin. Also, we were sat at this tiny littl table for 2, when the waitress came to check on us, she never took a single item off of the table. We were crowded and there were empty plates and cups...just terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston?start=20

It has 3 stars on Yelp, and 3. Anybody can make a burger. Wow, was I wrong. I ordered the Prime Chophouse burger with a cup of French Onion soup and got the chipotle aioli and garlic aioli dipping sauces on the side. The French Onion soup was so-so, nothing to write home about. But the burger was cooked perfectly, the onion bun was warm, fluffy, and flavorful, and the horseradish sautéed mushrooms were great.

Leslie T.,"Houston, TX",170,588,264,3.0,3/5/2014,"Burger patties have shrunk, prices gone up, service still the usual inattentive.  That pretty much sums it up. The meat patties used to be a lot thicker. They will still let you get it cooked medium rare though which a lot of places won't do. The burgers used to be a definite 2 handed meal. Now they have made them genuinely ""gourmet"" and shrunk them down to mere shadows of their former selves. I see that they want to make the toppings the star of the meal but you still want a decent sized patty of beef.  Every time they redo the menu they jack the prices up a buck or two. They now have a fancy topped burger with ciabatta bread for $13. I can get 2 Whataburger full meal deals with everything including a fistful of napkins because it's so damn huge for $15. So if you are looking for value THIS is not your best bet in the neighborhood. They offer lots of different burgers for $9-$13 and you can customize them with your choice of cheese, guac, bacon, gluten free rolls (upcharge) and sometimes this location gets those changes and additions right. Usually not, but sometimes they do on the first try! I would say 7 times out of 10 I have had to send my Sammy back to get it topped with what I ask to be on it. I won't deny that the food is tasty. I do like their relish, their cobb salad is still one of my favorites and am still a fan of the freckled lemonade ($5 bottomless). They have a full bar and usually some nifty cocktail ideas.  Their steak fries are bottomless too and if you want something besides ketchup now they have an assortment of dipping sauces for them - or to smear on your burger. I honestly tried the spicy ketchup (eh), Red's Secret Tavern Sauce (1000 island mixture) and the thai sauce (firey but sweet) and found none of them to be better than some good ol' ketchup. But it was nice to have the choices. You can get veggie burgers and chicken. The kids menu is a nice value for $5-$6. It includes corn dogs, pizza and the like with some nice side choices besides the fries...stuff like fruit and apple slices. Onion rings now come in the huge tower size and a smaller version which is much better for two folks to share. It's a sit down place where kids are welcome. It's clean and the food is good. But with prices continuing to go up and serving sizes continuing to go down I doubt I'll be frequenting this Red Robin as often as I used to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston?start=20

Alicia R.,"Danville, IN",152,261,197,3.0,1/25/2016,"My last visit wasn't so great, but in general I'm a fan of Red Robin. The freckled lemonade is different and so tasty. Probably full of sugar, but also fiber ;) The last time I went my friend and I ordered an appetizer of fried mozzarella and zucchini. The zucchini came in nice large wedges, and was very good. The mozzarella was typical. I had the Whiskey River burger this last time; I've ordered once with chicken instead, and I think that is much better. The last visit the burger was just so greasy the bottom bun was completely flattened and soaked. There may have also been other sauces, but really seemed to be mostly grease. I think next time I might try one of their burgers on a ciabatta bun. I also had a side of the aioli, which I think was garlic aioli, but mostly tasted very herby. Not bad, just not what I was expecting/wanting. One of my friends really likes their burger with pineapple. Desserts look great, but have never had room to go that far...

Their selection is good and the burgers are good size though if you get their tavern burgers they are smaller. They have endless fries which is nice.

Thierry T.,"Houston, TX",143,193,327,4.0,3/27/2015,"1. Service - excellent, can't complain. Great every time I come. The managers have the waitstaff trained to service all the same. They frequently check on you and they always carry a smile. It's an A-La-Carte system, wait to be seated, order at the table, and pay at the end.  2. Price - about $11-$30 a person. For the few times I've been here, it's always some sort of hamburger or chicken sandwich. You can't buy a burger or sandwich for less than $10. But with all this being said, it's worth it. About average for price.  3. Ambiance - dress code here is casual. The place is very relaxing. A cool hangout spot with friends or family. Large enough for parties. Jeans and flip flops are ok! 4. Food - I'm quite simple, a Lone Star Burger is my favorite. What's even better are their bottomless fries. Meaning, you pay for a tray of fries and they keep refilling at no extra cost!  5. Cleanliness - clean tables and restrooms, but their menus are a bit sticky during Rush hours.

We were seated, ignored for 15 minutes (only 1 other couple seated in our section, rest of the place was equally dead), finally a waiter named Chris realized we hadn't been waited on, took our order (Chophouse Burger combo and an Avo-Cobbo Salad) and then said he would figure out who was supposed to be serving our section. He brought us our drinks immediately. We then waited and waited and waited, until Laura, our actual server came by and said ""Your food will be ready in a minute"" and then walked off. And we waited. Food finally shows, not served by Laura. That server refilled our drinks.  Laura was walking around but never came to check on us. My boyfriend had to flag her down to get another drink refill and to ask for more fries. Those fries never came. We finally flagged her down and asked for a to-go container for my salad and our check. We waited. She comes back with the to-go container but said we had to wait for ""Someone else"" to get our bill. Beyond frustrated. We get our bill, I pay cash and we wait forever for change. This was just an absolutely horrible restaurant experience because we were just flat out ignored.

I had the California chicken sandwich - grilled chicken with bacon and guac.  I was disappointed that the guacamole was basically a spread, where it was hard to taste, but the sandwich overall was decent.  The chicken was slightly dry, but ok.   Given the pride with which they offer their bottomless fries, I was happy to discover (only by asking) that one could have steamed Veggies as a side option.  Unfortunately,  the dish was way too laden with bell peppers and unseasoned, but I guess what do I expect when I order steamed veggies in a burger joint.  The fries looked good.
