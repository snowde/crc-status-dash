Brian W.,"Madison, AL",1,15,3,2.0,1/13/2018,"Packed as always which is understandable.....waitress couldn't take our order right away, she had to do drinks and come back but at least she was upfront and said she was swamped.  Ordered drinks but 2 of them didn't come out in time and then one of the 2 were wrong. We got an appetizer of voodoo fries which were hot and messy and good. But....no napkins.  Napkins came with dinner but no silverware, finally got one set of plastic to-go silverware for our family of six.

Whitney D.,"Emerald Ridge Apartments, AL",116,110,328,4.0,3/24/2017,The service has gotten better the past few times I have been here. The burgers are always good! The fries are bottomless so don't be afraid to ask for more. Try them with extra seasoning  I love the double tavern burger. The bun is smaller and it has two thin patties with American cheese and apraxia tavern sauce. This burger never disappoints.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-huntsville
Bill B.,"Madison, AL",1939,478,1562,4.0,2/28/2017,"I visited the Red Robin at Bridge Street on 2/27 for lunch. Red Robin has a vast, but confusing, burger menu. So many options at many different price-points! After some research I found the Smoky Jack Tavern burger for only $6.99. I ordered the Smoky Jack and fries. I sat at the bar and was waited on by lovely Paula. She was very attentive and helped my with the kiosk ordering machine. The kiosk at my bar location didn't work so she took care of my order and checkout. The burger was very good and the endless fries is a nice option. I really like their fries and I always place extra Red Robin Signature Blend seasoning on the burger and fries. The burger, fries, and service were excellent.  My ticket before tip was $10.88.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-huntsville

C. M. F.,"Madison, AL",8,209,41,1.0,11/20/2017,"This was to be a come back tour since our last visit in November 2014. Unfortunately this place has continued to auger into the ground. The entire visit was marginally acceptable at best. The current hygienic qualities though were horrific. I went to grind some pepper on my burger and the inside portion of the grinder had unidentifiable food stuffs stuck to the inside portion of the grinder. Yes stuck, as if it had been there for some time. Who are you going to believe me or your lying eyes? The onion rings were great, but hey anything fried is good, right? The waitress acted like it was her first day, serving people that sat down after we did, and generally being uninterested in providing service. We tipped her 20% anyway because it really appeared like she was new to this line of work. I did bring this up to the manager AFTER we paid because I did not want her to think that we were trying to milk them for a comp'ed meal. Her response really floored us both, ""well next time you come in my name is..."" are you kidding me? Her response should have been, ""I'm so sorry, we will correct this immediately and let me refund you your meal."" All we wanted was a clean atmosphere and decent food. Well we did not get it. As such, I for one WILL BE HAVE TO BE EXTREMELY HARD PRESSED to ever set foot inside of this rat trap restaurant again and recommend you don't either. If the things that are visible to customers out front are nasty, you can only imagine what goes on in the back that you don't see. Plenty of other eating establishments are available. I only rated them one (1) star because zero (0) stars is not an option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-huntsville
Stephanie L.,"KY, KY",28,1,,1.0,1/8/2018,"We have always loved this place until this last visit the end of December 2017. We, party of 2, had our name put on the wait list and told 10-15 minutes. Next thing I notice is people are walking in and being seated and we are still waiting. The male hostess seemed distraught with his job and blamed the manager. We were then seated right past the hostess desk, surrounded by dirty tables full of dishes that were all still there when we left the restaurant. It did not seem that a server was even assigned our table as we again waited. Our server seemed very overworked/rushed as we become the invisible table. We used the call server button for our table and the two nasty tables around us in an attempt to get service while workers continued to walk past us. As we were leaving we talked to other guests who had the same problem and was told management had changed. From my perspective,it needs to change again!

Nastay N.,"Denver, CO",44,65,81,2.0,5/2/2017,"I remember going to Red Robin many times in Denver years ago and always having a good experience. I have no idea what has happen to this place but the product is horrendous. I can't stand going to a restaurant that specializes in something (in this case burgers) and failing miserably. I myself could care less about bottomless fries when all I wanted was a ""descent"" burger. I didn't expect anything spectacular, but I'm pretty sure I could have gotten the same quality burger at gas station. Yep, I said it. It's been 3 years since I've dined at a RR, and after tonight, it is clear that it will be my last. 2 stars for our server Paula who was a sweetheart and for my nephew's Boca burger that you can get in any grocery store and cook it in a toaster oven that made him happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-huntsville
Lauren C.,"Huntsville, AL",48,9,3,4.0,5/27/2017,"This was my first time eating at RR, and I was delighted to see so many options on the menu-- even some vegetarian and low carb. I splurged and had the DGB, a burger topped with oven roasted tomatoes (tasted more like sun dried), arugula, and garlic aioli and served on a ciabatta roll. The combinations of flavors was wonderful! Unfortunately the ciabatta didn't hold up to the aioli, and I ended up eating it with a fork. The fries were fresh and hot, and I topped them with the house seasoning on the table. Our server was very attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-huntsville
Debra W.,"Detroit, MI",1,6,5,3.0,6/28/2016,"Service throughout the entire meal was painfully slow for the amount of customers. Our bar drinks took forever because the bar tender went AWOL and the waitress had to go behind the bar and get them herself.  This location has no public wifi , seriously!!?!? Our waitress, Krystal, was amazing and really tried over and above to give us exceptional service. Once the food arrived, the burger was perfectly prepared but the ciabatta needed to be grilled/toasted because it got a bit soggy. The gaahlikkk fries, however absolutely rocked for being lukewarm and taking 15 min for refills!! Sigh... Being from out of state and relying on Apple and Google maps, we had to walk the ENTIRE length of the mall to get there only to realize there was a parking lot on that side of the mall. Both maps do not show that access.

We were warned at the front door they could not serve grilled chicken or burgers, not 100% sure what that was about (possibly a grill down or something), BUT the staff stayed very positive about it, let us know right away in case we wanted to choose a new venue, and were wonderful hosts. We sat at the bar, had amazing service, and the appetizers we ordered were delicious.

Blanca E.,"Madison, AL",1862,128,1905,4.0,4/20/2016,"East Meets South Meets Yummy w the new Red Ramen Burger for my tummy! ;P  While I may not usually care for a burger (unless it's In-N-Out), I always support my hubby's cravings for them.  Yesterday afternoon we did just so. LOCATION & PARKING 5/5 Located conveniently within Bridge Street Town Center on the far end toward Monaco but just after Belk, you'll have many nearby parking spots to choose from under the shade of the somewhat new parking structure or out in the open.  Either one you choose would be a short walk to the restaurant which can be seen nearby.     ATMOSPHERE & AMBIANCE 4/5 What can you expect from a Red Robins?  Well this location sports some interesting pieces on the wall.  I especially like what they have on the far back wall, particularly the multiple colored baseballs designed to resemble the American flag, the 12-inch LP records placed together as Bob Marley's afro, and the set of PacMan art pieces made out of rubik's cubes.  It's definitely a family friendly environment with many tables and booths.  Depending on the time you come, you can hold a small lunch meeting in the back section w a few co-workers over a late bite and miss the crowd and to have some privacy w/o being concerned of anyone eavesdropping.  This was about the time we arrived yesterday.  So it wasn't crazy busy and we could actually hear each other. During busy lunch and dinner times, expect otherwise.     SERVICE 4/5 Yesterday's service w Jeremy and new trainee Josh (I think that's what his name was) was by far better than prior visits we've experienced.  These guys were attentive yet not overbearing, knowledgeable and quick to answer our questions on specific menu items, and patient and genuinely kind.  The southern accent was a nice touch too. 8)  Even the server was fun and outgoing.  Prior visits were the total opposite in that we didn't even see our waitress from taking our order until they assumed we were done w our meal and attempted to bring up our bill total on the table device.  Anyways, we were happy with the recent visit.  Just wish our experience would be consistently good in all our visits (and there aren't that many since).  That's one of the reasons why we don't frequent this establishment often as we do others.     FOOD 4.5/5 Hubby ordered the delicious FIERY GHOST TAVERN BURGER.  If you like a nice kick to your bite that lasts beyond it, this is the one to consider.  I daringly tasted it and it was worthy of two more bites.  Haha.  ;P  Each bite screamed deliciousness w the ghost pepper sauce running off the side and a nice kick from the fried jalapeños.  Hubby enjoyed his burger to completion, along with the bottomless fries that came with it. I ordered & devoured the RED RAMEN BURGER.  Yes, you read that correctly! NOODLES, baby!!  We didn't have to drive all the way back to California to get a ramen burger cause they offer it here!   Lol.  And if you know me for any length of time, I'd choose noodles (lo mein or pansit) over rice any day... everyday!  [Rice, as w most Filipinos, is a staple when I cook at home.]  You can imagine I was indeed delighted to see this as a menu item, and of all places, here @ RR.  And so that's exactly what I ordered.  The bun was made out of seasoned ramen noodles pressed and fried together!  Every bite had a nice crunch to it. #nomnom  And since I don't like getting messy when I eat, I used a knife and fork AND a spoon to eat this ramen burger!  Haha.  [Yes, I do this w pizza too.]  There were two tantalizingly delish sauces that brought out the flavors in this burger - teriyaki and something they call chiu chow aioli.  Both satiated my taste buds.  We actually requested they bring out extra sauces, but not cause the burger needed it, but so we could dip our fries into them!  They were that good!  Inside this ramen burger came a medley of chili-infused shredded cabbage, sliced red onions, thinly sliced carrots, fresh basil and a few fried jalapeños which made for a nice kick.  It's simply worth a try and you'll sure to have a party in your mouth too! ;D  But don't wait too long to go.  Sadly, the ramen burger is being offered for limited time.  Go there now! ;D     VERDICT & RETURN 4/5 This recent visit redeemed prior visits.  And so long as they're serving the Red Ramen Burger and hubby continues to crave burgers, we'll likely not wait another 6 months before coming back. ;D  Check them out for yourself and do try the Red Ramen Burger!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-huntsville
Vanessa Z.,"Huntsville, AL",0,7,,5.0,7/4/2017,"Their food is excellent every time we go! The poutine fries are my favorite appetizer, definitely worth a try!

April T.,"Decatur, GA",6,12,,2.0,8/22/2016,"My family and I went here yesterday afternoon/evening to celebrate my husband's birthday, per his request. We won't be going back anytime soon. We've noticed a decrease in customer service over the past 6 months or so. The first problem we ran into was at the hostess stand, where no one was waiting and no one arrived to help for around 5 minutes. It was also noticeably messy.  After sitting in our booth for 15 minutes or so, we couldn't get anyone to serve us. We ended up leaving since we couldn't even get water. There seemed to be plenty of staff running around, but they all ignored us. We even had the last luck to be seated near the apparent ""staff area"" where they all sat or stood around eating and talking while we waited...and waited.  On our way out I stopped (and again waited for the hostess to arrive) so I could let her know. I told her that no one was there to serve us. Her response, instead of apologizing or asking if she could do anything or even get the manager, was ""Okay. Have a nice day.""  Completely disappointed, we went and spent our money elsewhere. If a manger reads this, you really should understand that there is a surplus of restaurants at Bridge Street. We chose to go to Red Robin because we like it, with this kind of service you will lose customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-huntsville?start=20

I dont think I will be going back any time soon, it gets old. You are packed in the building like sardines, its very loud at times and can be difficult to hold a conversation, and I find that they are very stingy with the bottomless fries. You basically get one refill if you ask for it and its a very small portion. Sometimes the waiters are good and sometimes they look like they hate their job. Fries are good but nothing special, burgers are just ok, but their chocolate ice cream cake is AMAZING and can be shared between 2-3 people.

We felt like we didn't get our money's worth.  I would have liked more sweet potato fries in the initial holder - when we got the refill basket it was too much too late, unfortunately.  Our waitress was nice but seemed nervous.  The manager walked by our table at least 3 times but never asked how our meal was.  I asked for a different glass to have my freckled lemonade instead of the fancy one that is mostly ice but the waitress said they couldn't do it.  Other RRs have always granted my request.  It is unfortunate because we would have gone here every night this week if they had gotten it right.  They lost our business - at least at this location.  The three stars is for the great tasting food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-huntsville?start=20

Karen E.,"Atlanta, GA",5,2,,2.0,2/3/2015,"I'm here to talk about the fries, and the service, and the serving of the fries. See, when you order a burger at this joint, it's supposed to come with ""endless"" fries.  So, reasonably enough, plates are delivered with about four fries in a little cone.  Okay, it's more than four, but it's about 1/10 of a serving at any other restaurant. That wee tiny frycone, and the chain's proud espousal of endless fries, might give you the impression that more fries are forthcoming.  I've eaten at the Bridge Street Red Robin three times now, and I can testify that there will _not_ be more fries. I actually don't even care that much for fries in general, but they're a good test of the cheerfully negligent service at this location.  Want more of your side dish?  Too bad.  Need a refill because the waiter filled your first glass with ice?  He'll be back with it ... long after you've lost your appetite.  Want one of the special sauces so proudly advertised on the menu?  Oops, he forgot to bring that.  He'll get it for you...never. If you can handle the service, the food is okay.  The buttery, brioche-like buns are good.  The burgers and sides are prepared consistently, though a lot of the menu items are so overwrought that they're kind of boring.  So yeah, not my favorite place.  I'd like to say that I could see going there for a low-key dinner after a movie, but I honestly wouldn't do that.  I'd rather have no service than bad service, so I'd probably end up at Five Guys where I can get my own damned water.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-huntsville?start=20

I always get the blue ribbon when I get there, as it's to die for!  Just wish they stayed open a little later on the weekends because Huntsville needs more adult like hangout spots, this isn't their fault. Overall my experience there was very nice and i would recommend going there for lunch or light drinks. Just don't go before they close like we did!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-huntsville?start=20
James P.,"Huntsville, AL",1,10,,4.0,8/15/2012,I love this place. The staff is friendly. The burgers are always great. They make everything to order.

Julie K.,"Madison, AL",6,6,4,4.0,8/27/2010,"Great Food! Especially the bacon Cheesburger!!! YUMMO!  All you can eat fries, if you like.  I like to use the special spice they have on the tables, it is sooooo good and dip my fries in ranch dressing.  Wait staff is good and friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-huntsville?start=60
Charles G.,"Canton, GA",92,380,90,4.0,12/16/2010,"My wife and I enjoy their burgers, mostly because it's one of the few places we can enjoy a fried egg on a burger (something I got used to while traveling around southeast Asia). Not health food, obviously, but it's feel-good food when you've not had a good burger in a while. The drinks we've had there have all been good, and sitting at the bar is definitely a good idea to beat the crowd and have more attentive service.  The only negative is the absurd number of children running around, but it's pretty much the only nice, sit-down restaurant at Bridge Street that would appeal to children.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-huntsville?start=40

Ron D.,"Killen, AL",0,8,,1.0,10/31/2014,"Arrived at 12:20. Seated at 12:45. Busy lunch time.  Ordered food at 12:55. Facts are: 1.  Had to ask for one of the drinks twice after the other four drinks had been placed on the table 10 minutes earlier.  2.  Food showed up 55 minutes after we placed our order.  3.  One of the Grandkids pizza did not come out with the other food.  4.  We asked for extra tartar sauce and Mexican ranch. Neither of those came out with the meal. 5.  I ordered the fish and chips. Don't order fish at a place that specializes in burgers.  My mistake for sure. Chips (French Fries) were cool, barely warm. 6.  Eight minutes after our food arrived and the pizza had not arrived, I called over the manager and told him what had transpired up to this point. Was very apologetic; brought out hot fries, my Grandson's pizza and the requested sauces.  7.  Asked for fries when we ordered our drinks. Waitress said that the kitchen was very busy and that they might not be able to get us any.  Fries did show up about 15 minutes later.  Overall, considering the timeliness, quality (fries being cold) and numerous items having to be requested several times, we won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-huntsville?start=40

My only 2 qualms about this particular visit were the AC (we were seated right under the vent) and my burger wasn't as hot as it should have been..like it was sitting out for a few after it was cooked.

MaLisa C.,"Huntsville, AL",2,23,4,4.0,4/12/2011,"Recently a group of friends and I traveled over here to celebrate a birthday. They sat us pretty promptly without much problem. The handful of times I've been here I've been pretty satisfied with the service. The waiters I've had were all nice and answered questions without much problem.  The food is good for what it is, a chain burger restaurant. The burgers are good and fresh, the steak-fries are...fries. I do like that there's a variety of burgers and sandwiches so you don't have to eat the same one every visit. My first venture here wasn't terribly successful. I had the Bruschetta Chicken Sandwich because when I hear the word pesto-anything in the description, I must try it. Unfortunately at that time the only thing that really had any flavor was the salty chicken on it.. It was pretty bland and messy. I should have expected that from a chain but I was holding a tiny flame of hope.  This last time I had the Souper Sandwich Combo with the Ceasar's Chicken Wrap and French Onion Soup (yeah, I'm one of those who go to a fish place and order a steak, okay). The wrap was pretty good and quite large. That French Onion Soup was great though. I tell you, I'd been craving French Onion Soup for a while and I honestly should have just ordered a bowl because I was going to turn that cup up and lick it clean. Now, that may have been just my insane craving but it is good, rich, salty, cheesy, bready, and oniony.  Our drinks were quite good, not too strong but you could taste the alcohol, it wasn't smothered inside the fruity deliciousness I ordered (strawberry daquiri). When you're sitting with your friend who has bartended for a good chunk of her life you learn the good from the bad.  Overall, this Red Robin is a good place to catch a decent burger and munch on steak fries (they're endless, you know?!). Even if you don't eat a lot of red meat there are still choices for you too. I think it's a good place to grab a drink and bring the kids with your friends and family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-huntsville?start=40
Jason B.,"Lexington, KY",1,2,1,5.0,1/6/2014,"Came in and say at the bar for lunch to grab a quick burger.  Right away the bartender was extremely personable and courteous.  So much so that I returned for dinner that evening.  Ordered a menu item which was listed on the website however was a seasonal item and not on the restaurant menu. The bartender Gerald (spelling?) didn't hesitate and went to the kitchen and had the item custom made to order anyway, Wow!  Even though the range of entree prices are in the lower end I received 5 star service.

Brooke D.,"Harvest, AL",51,160,189,4.0,3/15/2010,"I really like this place, but I have to be in the mood to spend a good bit on a burger.  They have a very wide selection of burgers and sandwiches.  The burgers are very large and the presentation is always good.  I almost always get the BBQ Burger (can't remember the full name, Whiskey River maybe?) and it is never a disappointment.  When I'm really hungry I'll try to split a tower of onion rings.  How clever, a tower, so it adds a bit of fun.  Their signature sauce that comes with the onion rings is absolutely delicious.  Even when I don't get the onion rings I ask for the sauce to dip my fries in. I've always had good service there as well. Also, the waiter told us that if you are seeing a movie you can order food to go and take it into the theater with you.  I've never been a big fan of eating during a movie, but if that's your thing then it seems like a pretty awesome deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-huntsville?start=40

I had the guacamole / bacon hamburger.  It was pretty good.  It wasn't wonderful, but it was pretty good.  It was a little pricey for a hamburger.   For what it is, I got what I expected.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-huntsville?start=40

The burgers are great.  When Red Robin opened up, we stopped going to Cheeburger Cheeburger for good burgers.  The Banzai Burger is my favorite.  The kids meals are reasonably priced.  Also, they actually have healthy side items the kids can choose from, like apples, oranges and carrots. We've never had a bad experience with the service.  Wait staff and hostesses are always friendly.  I'll definitely eat here again and recommend for everyone else to do the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-huntsville?start=40
