Chuck M.,"Fort Worth, TX",1282,673,344,5.0,7/4/2017,"Each and every time we visit Red Robin, it seems to get better and better. What a surprise we had today when we walked into the NE Mall location, they had remodeled! What a beautiful job was done. The new chairs at the new tables are SO comfortable. My wife had the Tavern Double Burger and I opted for the Sirachi Tavern Double Burger. Of course, we had to have Red Robin's bottomless steak fries. I totally love the Red Robin Seasoning Salt and their spicy ketchup. Our burgers were wonderful and prepared perfectly. Mike, our server, took excellent care of us. The Purple Popping Lemonade was just tart enough to quench my thirst on a HOT July 4th. Thank you, Red Robin, for an awesome time and a bright newly remodeled location, you ROCK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hurst
Lone R.,"Hurst, TX",0,5,2,2.0,9/30/2017,"Used to my favorite burger joint, best burgers around... until last night - Sept 28, 2017. The restaurant has remodeled and apparently threw out the good cooks with the old furniture.  Burgers were dry, over cooked and not near as tasty as before.  My wife's meal came out in two servings, with the main course being 20 minutes afterwards.  It was overcooked and not the same good quality meal as before. The waitress ran her tail off trying to make things right and even had the manager get involved.  Sure they took off a bit for my wife's meal but that's not what's important - we wanted a nice, peaceful and enjoyable meal but it's not the same Red Robin we used to enjoy. Not sure if we'll be back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hurst
Ashley P.,"Frisco, TX",117,90,186,2.0,9/5/2017,If you're looking for a good burger from a chilis-like chain this is a fine place to go. They cook the burgers well and their choice of bun is great.  Steak fries are my favorite but that may be because I loved them in my childhood and am hanging on to that (??). And their campfire sauce with it is yummy. Bonus points that they're bottomless. Make sure you shake some of their seasoning on it though.  Freckled lemonade - bland.  If you want a want a safe place (in terms of food) that's kid friendly it's a good option.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hurst

Dru T.,"Denton, TX",41,101,104,4.0,10/11/2017,"I ate here for lunch the other day and had a pretty great experience!  I did not get my waitress' name unfortunately, but she was friendly and attentive.  The burger I had was delicious.  I did not like the mayonnaise that came default on the bacon burger, but I will ask them to leave it off next time.  I am not a huge fan of their fries either, because they are more like thick cut potato wedges, and I like thinner, crispier fries.  That is more my personal preference though, and for potato wedges they were done well.  The burger meat and buns were perfect though, plus the restaurant was clean, and the service quick and friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hurst
Holly C.,"Fort Worth, TX",36,95,3,1.0,6/2/2017,"I was really not thrilled with my first visit to Red Robin. We decided to come here since they had gluten-free buns and a lot of people I know are big fans of the place. Maybe I just got an off night, but my overall experience was not great. For one thing, I am apparently not the brightest, because I didn't realize that aioli = mayonnaise. I'm not a fan of dipping fries in mayo, so that's probably my mistake. I also didn't really enjoy being charged extra for gross mayo that I didn't even use (only 75 cents, but still, it's the principle.)  The atmosphere was kind of loud, like a sports bar. Our server was friendly enough but she told us some gross story about eating until you puke, so you can then go back and eat more. The burger and fries were fine, but not memorable enough in contrast to being charged for flavored mayo to dip my fries in and a server with unpleasant and inappropriate conversation. Red Robin is now shorthand between me and my husband for ""bad restaurant experience,"" so needless to say, I don't plan on coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hurst

Andrew W.,"Fort Worth, TX",188,75,198,2.0,6/25/2016,"Mediocre food, mediocre service. From the hostess to the waiters to the confused staff standing around, our service was pretty poor. Everything kind of felt like a flustered mess. It was often difficult to get any attention from our waiter. Once we finally got food, it was pretty underwhelming. I was surprised because I had always heard pretty good things about Red Robin. I'll update this of I go back, but, there's a lot of burger places out there.

Sunday N.,"North Richland Hills, TX",392,3,2,5.0,10/6/2017,"Last night my family and I went to this Red Robin and my baby girl received the best service from multiple servers!

Phillip D.,"Fort Worth, TX",69,305,499,4.0,3/10/2017,"We have started making this one of our go to restaurants. We always get in within a descent time. It is amazing what these guys can do with a burger. In the menu, the higher prices start in the front. If you wade you way to the middle and back, you can get a great burger with a lot of special stuff for about $10. They offer the bottomless fries. Sometimes the refill can be slow, depending on how busy they are. Reorder before you run out. My guest favorite fry is the garlic and Parmesan cheese. I like the sweet potato. The staff is pretty dedicated and trained to treat the customer well. Since they have to tell the same story over and over, their spill can get routine sounding. But who cares, I am here to be entertained by the food. The place is clean so drag the kids along. Just don't let them eat off the floor, like they do at home. Oh wait, that's my dog who does that!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hurst
Joel B.,"North Richland Hills, TX",12,9,1,2.0,9/12/2017,Stopped in looking for the nostalgia of a good Red Robin burger. Had a bacon cheeseburger and fries. It was a Tuesday lunch and not busy. Order took about 20 minutes to get to me. When I got it burger was just kinda meh and fries were cold. I think it had probably been sitting for a bit till someone ran it. Restaurant looks good as far as the remodel. Putting lipstick on a pig doesn't change that it's a pig though. They need to update the concept. Don't know what it is but if not they'll just end up falling flat like other 90s greats such as Joe's Crab Shack and Bennigans.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hurst

Efrain G.,"Dallas, TX",38,1,,1.0,9/17/2017,I've loved Red Robin for a long time. They have good burgers they do. But today experience ruined it forever. The one off north east mall had terrible service. We waited for over an hour to get our food and it was not even cooked right and way too salty  nor was it even the correct order. We got the food to go so we didn't see it was a bad order. The manager did take off 50% but not going there again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hurst

Mayra O.,"Fort Worth, TX",2,13,15,5.0,8/17/2017,"This place has stepped it up Tuesday night I went with my puppy and bf to have a burger out on their patio. First of all the waitress was super nice! She tended our table various times to make sure we were okay throughout the whole stay. Second, the manager was very impressive, for, she took full responsibility of the mishap that occurred with our appetizer arriving after our burgers.

Ciara J.,"Valdosta, GA",20,86,81,5.0,1/20/2014,"My family and I decided to grab a late lunch after church. As soon as we walked in, the waitstaff was very welcoming and friendly.  I had the Sauteed Shroom Burger with bottomless fries and a peach tea to drink. The burger came out hot and tasted amazing. Our waitress, I believe her name was Lauren, was helpful and always made sure that everything was going great throughout our meal.  Although we don't live in the area, I don't mind driving to this location because of the great customer service and the great food!  Also, here's a tip. If you don't want fries with your meal, Red Robin now offers options! You can get either sweet potatoes fries, broccoli or others, bottomless and at the same price! Awesome! I can't wait to go again!

Mark T.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,6,11,5.0,7/28/2015,"I do not typical write many reviews because a restaurant has to be really awful or over the top for me to take the time to write about it. So in this case it was so good I had to say something. My family and I went for dinner Sunday night. We all ordered and with my order I got onion rings.  Now I realize they are probably pre-breaded and simply flash fried. But mine came out so cold it was as if they has been moved from the refrigerator to the plate. The manager came over (I did not get her name) because they were so cold. She held out her hands and made me put all of the onion rings in her hand. She said that it was disgusting to leave them on my plate. Then she brought me a very hot order herself. Then she went above and beyond...she brought out another order of onion rings in a to go box.

Julie S.,"North Richland Hills, TX",106,287,54,3.0,4/4/2013,"RR is pretty solidly a-Ok.   Here are the reasons we come here: 1. Consistency ... The food may not not be stellar, but it s edible, hot, and the portions are big enough to share (or take home leftovers). 2. Zucchini fries + ultimate Margs.  I love the zucchini sticks {hint: ask them to cut them in half, lengthwise, for skinnier sticks.... You get 10 to an order instead of 5!} and the margaritas are certainly passable 3.  Location, location, location.  Right in front of the mall, by petsmart yet conveniently NOT in the mall parking lot.  And, 5 min from our house Don't get me wrong, if there's a wait we don't stay.  If anything else sounds good we go there, not here.  But if we don't want to cook, don't want be far from home, or if I need zucchini sticks we come here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hurst?start=60
Summer M.,"Corpus Christi, TX",20,29,5,1.0,8/18/2014,"I'm giving this Red Robin one star strictly for the service. The food is what you expect from this restaurant, consistent. Service was apathetic.  I came with my family of five, three kids two adult.  We arrived at a later time, 9pm on a Sunday, so we were seated promptly. The waitress was right on top of us for our drink orders giving us no time to look over the menu. I ordered a monster shake and waters, husband and kids orders drinks as well.  For the whole table server brought two waters. When she finally brought the drinks it was one at a time with several minutes between trips and blaming the bartender for the delay. When my milk shake was delivered she only bright half the order and when I asked her about it she again blamed the bartender said she would bring out the other half at no charge, REALLY!, thanks because it is what I ordered.  After our drinks were all finally at the table she decided to take our food order. Everyone's meals were fairly uncomplicated but I told her mine would be a pain in the ass. I ordered a garden burger with a few changes, what I always order.  We waited so long and the restaurant was freezing so I took my daughter outside to wait.  Order was wrong, no garden burger and it took another 15 min to get my order remade, by that time the family was nearly through their food.

It was a nice surprise for a low price burger restaurant. They also now feature gourmet burgers and traditional american burgers. They have a small variety of fish and chicken sandwiches. I highly recommend this particular location, their patio is great for cool evenings in DFW. You will not be let down by your experience at this Red Robin.... yummmmm!!!

Deby S.,"Keller, TX",0,2,,5.0,12/9/2015,"My husband and I recently visited this location for the first time on a busy Friday night; we opted to sit at the bar rather than wait for a table.  We were quickly and pleasantly greeted by ""Tony"" the bartender.  Drink order taken and delivered in a timely fashion.  Ditto our meal -- was actually pleasantly shocked meal came out hot and delicious so quickly given how busy the restaurant was at 8:00 on a Friday night   While the food was tasty, my primary reason for this review is to compliment our bartender -- he was extraordinary.  Obviously sitting at the bar, we were able to watch Tony in action a little closer than other employees.  He greeted each restaurant guest genuinely and enthusiasticlly -- maintaining eye contact...not the usual obligatory type of greeting.  He recognized regulars warmy and took the time to make honest beer recommendations based on patron tastes all the while juggling meal deliveries, ringing up bills, etc...He appeared to be an excellent bar manager amidst the Friday night chaos.  He also was warmly and genuinely appreciative of our business and thanked us, telling us to have a good night after we paid our check.   My husband is the primary Yelp reviewer in our family; we eat out a fair amount at high end, low end and every end in between restaurants.  We've been waited on and served by 100's.  Tony was by far one of the most impressive and professional service staff we've encountered.  He really should be put in charge of training other restaurant employees -- he's excellent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hurst?start=60

That being said, it's reliable with regard to portion sizes, service and speed. It isn't a quick place, but it's certainly reasonable. I will say that around holidays, this particular location get's more than it's fair share of business (especially during lunch!).  Try the Lone Star Burger. It's messy. It's huge.

It better be good at that price! I ordered the Banzai burger which had cheddar and pineapple. The wife had a bacon cheeseburger. The Banzai was delicious. Never had a burger with pineapple. Bacon burger was great as well. Fries are bottomless, but they give you a tiny amount and good luck getting more! Also, this is the first time I've ever paid $7 for a DRAFT beer. I expected it to be a decent size for that price, but no. To sum up, be expected to pay anywhere from $10 to $15 per person for an entrée alone.

Larry said that the order would be ready at 5:56. I arrived at 5:54 and had to wait for about 25 minutes, before I got my food. The restaurant was very understaffed and no one was waiting on the to-go orders, until about 20 minutes later, a nice man who was replacing something in the bar, went and got someone to come and help me, and also waited on the lady who had come in about 10 minutes, after I did. She was able to get her order, before I did, but I had to wait a few minutes longer and then the order still wasn't right. It was missing some fries and also didn't have the extra buffalo sauce that I requested, and when the waiter went back to get some more, he came back in about a minute with a tiny 1/2 order or less.  I think my order must have been ready for 30 minutes, because, when I got home with the food, it was cold and tasted like it had been setting for a really long time.

We had a wonderful server named, Isaac. He was very polite although our orders were not made correctly.  My first friend, ordered a Texas Burger and a Mijito. The food was brought to us in a timely manner. However, the Mojito was made way too strong. After three attempts made, the drink was finally made somewhat correctly. I could certainly tell that the bartender does not much experience.  I ordered a burger that was to be cooked to medium. My was completely rare and I had to have it remade. My last friend requested for several things that were not brought out to her.

I ordered a seafood plater that comes with clams, cod and shrimp. They did not make shrimp. They totally forgot. The clams were not fully cooked and ate some not thinking they would be raw. The clams were 99% breaking and 1. % clam. Some may ask why order seafood at a know. Burger place... Well I have had almost all of them. Felt like a decent place for my son and he loves the MVPizza. Overall I feel maybe management has changed. They seem to be getting bad with service and food. Sad day in our family we won't be going back to this location. So we decided to try this place again, Wow what a difference! It seems they have been really working on everything since the last visit and it was not just our table. The managers seemed to touch every table, even the kitchen manager was walking around asking to see how the food was table to table! Thanks again for a great visit and I'm glad the last visit was just one bad event and not the norm! Thanks Jerry",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hurst?start=20
Lauren M.,"Denver, CO",557,124,154,3.0,10/11/2014,"Tonight I tried some new things on the menu! My boyfriend ordered us an appetizer of fried zucchini and cheese sticks. This was some of the best fried zucchini I've ever had, although it was SUPER HOT. Be careful.  My usual burger is the bleu ribbon with a turkey patty and garlic aioli instead of the chipotle. It's so freaking good. The fried onions and onion bun are just amazing. I forgot to order sweet potato fries, but I usually get those and they have some pretty good ones albeit sometimes a bit soggy.  The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is simply because it would appear this location is being managed very poorly, Hosts are just sitting around and I've heard from past employees that this lazy attitude is due to people essentially ""giving up"", because their GM is awful. This trickles down and sometimes, in past experiences, has affected service and food quality. But hopefully that changes!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hurst?start=20

We walked in, were taken first to the wrong section by the hostess, then made to walk to another section to sit at a table where the seats were wet and the table sticky. We then waited 15 minutes with nobody coming to get our drink order, until the hostess noticed and came and brought us water. Then after another 10 minutes, we had to go get the hostess again and ask who our waiter was, because they were yet to come to our table. By the time he came, we were ready to place our order. We then waited another 20 minutes to receive our food. The waiter also never came back to check on us throughout this time. We then received our burgers. My burger was great, fries were cold, but one of the people with me received a burger that was completely burnt! I attached a picture. The good thing is that the manager brought the new burger out, and surprisingly the service improved. We received fresh fries, the burger was cooked great, and the waiter attended to us more. All in all, I believe the restaurant is short staffed, the quality needs to be evaluated, and attention to the customer needs to be of top priority.

Too bad you won't get any because you won't be able to find your waitress!... I digress... We came here during lunch to be surprised that they DO NOT HAVE LUNCH SPECIALS. I know I've said it before, but restaurants that NICKEL AND DIME EVERYTHING are an annoyance to me. Here they charge you to substitute everything. Allergic to mayo, so you need a different sauce instead? That'll be $0.75. (It's about the principal) Now, I'm not allergic to mayo but you get my point. They literally state on the menu an example like this one. I understand charging to substitute fries with onion rings, but a sauce? Really? Despite the above, I did like the food. The burger (double patty tavern burger) I had WAS GOOD and had PLENTY OF CHEESE. The steak fries here were excellent, but also MIA. I equate this place to a more expensive Steak N Shake.

We started with the chips, salsa and guacamole appetizer for $5.  Seriously I think we got maybe a 2 ounce portion cup of each of the dips.  The chips were served in a cone and we crispy, salty but not warm.  Overall, not a good value for the price. Jay ordered the whiskey river bbq burger and fries.  He ate every bit and even got a refill on fries.  For $10, I think it's a little steep but maybe I am just out of touch with the gourmet burger scene. I ordered the Ensenada chicken platter, which is two small chicken breasts and a salad.  Food tasted good and I had plenty to take home.  Again, $12.50 seems high for the amount of food received.

(Press pass, mailer coupons, etc.) We joined their royal red program they have which earns you free food and so on. On a plus side the kroger next to our house carries red robin gift cards so we pick on up before we go to eat there to get the gas reward points as well. So we end up coming here as a fail safe. This is the location is the closest to our home; and the staff has always been nice and timely with our food.

Dash W.,"Keller, TX",162,23,3,2.0,3/21/2012,"So me and my family decide that it would be best to celebrate my husband and his brothers birthday dinner at Red Robin in Hurst, TX. We had a rather large group consisting of parents, 3 children, spouses, making for a pretty large order. The service was wonderful with accommodating to us and the waiter we had was perfect. So where did things go wrong? The food.  Bland bland bland.  First off, my husband and I are on a low carb, low sugar diet. Red Robin claims it's a great place to get a menu that caters to that. Well, actually they did. I ordered the chicken caprese, and hubby went and ordered the Royal Red Robin burger with steamed broccoli, and no bun .  The Royal Red Robin came out and the burger was bland with zero seasoning, and rubber-like. The egg that was supposed to be on it was also overcooked rubber with also zero seasoning. The broccoli was hardly steamed, and once again, plain as could be.  Mine was an interesting idea, with large pieces of mozzarella slices, a Caesar like salad with fried pepperoni, and chicken that had been grilled with a pico topping.  The mozzarella had some sort of broun sauce on it, but once again no flavor. The cheese itself also (I don't know how) also had no flavor. The salad was overdressed with dressing which was a typical Caesar dressing, pepperoni chips were over-fried, and the chicken was burnt horribly. The burn flavor went and made itself the star of the dish with its horrific flavor, and ZERO seasoning. Even the pico was bland and I think did not have cilantro even in it.  With kids constantly bugging on me, and parents talking non-stop, me and the husband tried to be nice and not cause a scene, (since his parents are very easily upset by things like this) and tried to eat what we had. I of course was starving since I had not eaten all day and tried to at least go with having half.  I noticed the kids and rest of the family only ate about half of their meals too, and I'm sure that like us, the brother and his wife were also unhappy with the food. (kids didnt even take but one bite of their food)  So that's it really. Horribly bland food, but wonderful service. The waiter we had was friendly, and always refilling drinks, checking on us.

This was not fast food, but an establishment with hosts, servers, and a bar.  Everything started off wonderfully, with a cheerful host leading us to a table that was clean, with full condiments, and not placed too near any particularly loud or boisterous groups.  Our server arrived at the table in a few moments, took our drink order, and upon returning, was ready to take our food order.  We had promised to bring something back for the Mother-in-Law, and I notified the server at that time that we'd be needing it to go, after we were through with our meal.  Most of the meal passed smoothly, as expected (the food was great), until the server brought a refill of the bottomless steak fries the restaurant is famous for.  He set the puny basket on the table, and informed us that our to-go order was almost ready.  WAIT.  Hold up...  almost ready?  I'm still working on my meal.  It's Valentine's Day, and I'm out to celebrate!  We walked in the door less than 30 minutes ago, and you're, in effect, rushing me out again already?  What if I wanted more fries?  I just got off of a 9-hour shift at work.  I'm hungry.  What if we wanted dessert?  Or a drink?  Now I have hot food on its way to the table, ready to take home for someone else.  You have cut my evening short, and stopped my check at its current total.  The $41 total could have been 56, for which I'd have tipped you around $12-15.  Instead, you got 6.  The lesson here...  ask before sending that order to the kitchen.  Don't rush me through my meal.  I understand turning over tables, but you had two empty.  It wouldn't have killed you to allow us to set the pace.  It's something I learned in my first day of training.  Apply it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hurst?start=100

Tara B.,"Plano, TX",28,56,,3.0,3/26/2012,"I'm only giving this location a 3 because the food is pretty good consistently.  The service however is another story.  My friends and I eat here more than I care to admit as a go to place for a decent burger and fries and we normally don't have any issues. Our visit tonight was quite another story.   We were greeted fairly quickly and sat at about 9pm on Sunday night.  The waiter came by slowly and got our drink orders but didn't give us a chance to order appetizers nor did he ask.  He brought the drinks and left quickly and came back probably 7 to 10 minutes later to take our order.  Our food came out pretty quickly by another waitress.  I had the wrappin California club and it was not made correctly it came out with just turkey, lettuce and avocado.  We told the waitress it was wrong and initially she tried to argue but then agreed and took it back for correction.  5 to 7 minutes later my wrap returned....for a wrap that wasn't even hot..there is no reason it should have taken that long for correction.  Our waiter finally returned several minutes later and asked the customary ""how's your food?"" but again didn't wait long enough for us to answer.  So we ate and the food was good, before we were all finished the waiter came with the check and said ""no rush"" and boy did he mean that.  We all finished up and sat there for another 10 minutes or so without even seeing the waiter.  It appeared that he was also waiting on a  larger table and the other 3 or 4 servers were busy cleaning for closing and couldn't be bothered with customers.  Our waiter appeared but didn't make it to our table so I went to the bar to get someone there to cash us out and found the manager.  He apologized and brought the completed check back to the table.  While waiting on the manger to return the waiter finally came by and asked about the check and we told him I had taken to the manager and he said .. "" ok cool""!  Not I'm sorry but ok cool...well there was nothing cool about it.   To top it off when the manager dropped off the check he didn't ask how the experience was or the service 9or the food, just apologized again for the delay and walked away.   Luckily we got a survey with the check so they will be getting this earful as well.  Very disappointing experience.  We will go back but it will be awhile and we will probably go to grapevine location instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hurst?start=100
MaryLouise M.,"Hurst, TX",2,8,,5.0,5/13/2014,"My husband and i have been going to Red Robin for a long time (more than 7 years) and we have always had the very best of service.  It is a wholesome, family oriented restaurant and the servers go out of their way to be friendly and provide excellent service.  We became more impressed, when we started bringing our little grandson to the restaurant.  By this time, we had out regular servers but we were so impressed with the EXTRA attention that they paid to him.  The servers, Brandon & Ted, went out of their way to come by and speak to him, even when they weren't our server.  We rate Red Robin one of the best restaurants that we frequent and it is HANDS DOWN, our grandsons favorite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hurst?start=100

Adam T.,"Hurst, TX",1,9,,4.0,9/4/2008,"I've been to Red Robin several times in the past. This trip was nothing new.....great food and good service.  In my latest visit to Red Robin, I ordered the Lone Star Burger. My wife ordered a bowl of French Onion soup and a side salad. Her salad looked very green and she said it was excellent. I was able to steal a few sips on the soup and it was very tasty.  My burger, the Lone Star, was absolutely wonderful. The guacamole and salsa definitely add a little kick to this burger. I highly recommend.  One of the things I love about Red Robin is the bottomless fries. As soon as we sit down at our table, I immediately ask for some fries. This works perfectly as a free appetizer and is great for helping to pass the time until your burger arrives.  Red Robin is quickly becoming one of my favorite burger chains.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hurst?start=100

It is one of those places we eat at when nothing else sounds good and we happen to be right there in that area. Last time we went will be the last time. Unless someone offers to pay our way. We arrived at 3 pm on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon. We actually chose to eat here so we could eat on the patio. Um no. They told us that patio was closed, they had just closed it. ?? really? There were 2 other tables sitting on the patio with a few of the emplyees playing with a dog? We decided to stay anyway since we were already there. They sat our family at a table that leaned so far to one side the silverware was rolling off. We asked ot be moved and were given nothing but dirty looks.

Allan P.,"Arlington, TX",11,36,,3.0,11/24/2008,Pretty average upscale burger chain.  You would probably be better off going across the parking lot to Carraba's or Genghis Grill.  If you do go here make sure you have the Bailey's shake.  It is the one bright spot on the menu.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hurst?start=100
Nickie G.,"Nashville, TN",744,1135,11,3.0,8/3/2008,"Ok, I am not even sure this is the Red Robin I went to, since I was way outside my comfort zone in Hurst...but it was near a mall so this one will do.  Anyway, I have been wanting to try this even if it is a chain because I have never heard of one before and they have been advertising up a storm.  So the first thing I noticed is that the interior kind of looks like a fast food joint, but you have servers and a BAR.  A BAR!  Yessss!  Then I had to peruse the menu extensively....more burgers than I could comprehend all at once...but I finally settled on the A1 Peppercorn burger.  It came with the onion ring strip things on it and spicy A1 peppercorn sauce (in case you didn't figure that one out from the name)...it was huge, messy, and delicious...(yep, that's what SHE said).  The other thing is that french fry refills are FREE.  Not that most people really NEED french fry refills but still.  Also can get refills of your coke and even have them put it in a to go cup (somehow I doubt you can do this for your alcoholic beverage, but give it a try and see what happens).  Overall not a bad burger, and even better than expected for a chain.  Doubt I'll go back though since I don't even know where the hell I was, but if I happen upon it again I'll stop.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hurst?start=100
Tyler E.,"Fort Worth, TX",7,67,,1.0,12/7/2009,"Went here with my wife and then cousins to be, primarily because we'd been here before and knew that everything on the menu could be turned vegetarian (huge selling point). The waiter brought my wife's burger out, it had bacon on it... she nicely apologized and said she didn't want any meat on her burger. She figured since she asked for a Boca patty, he would put 2 and 2 together. The waiter reached over me, snatched her plate, and huffed and puffed his way back to the kitchen. Now, at this particular Red Robin, you can see directly into the kitchen, so we saw this asshole mouthing and talking about our table, pitching a hissy fit. The manager conveniently stops by our table minutes later, when we request a new waiter. From there, it was a great experience, but that waiter really put a sour damper on our time there. It wasn't personal, we just wanted a meatless meal... no need to get in a tiff over it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hurst?start=100
Mike E.,"Mansfield, TX",0,38,6,4.0,10/23/2016,Great burgers. Unlimited fries with most sandwiches but they also have more healthy side options including veggies and fruit.

Megan B.,"Grand Prairie, TX",24,25,,1.0,1/22/2017,"I've been here before with no incident, but tonight I was just going to stop in with my family for a bite. There was a wait, we could tell because there were people sitting at the front. No big deal. The host was tending to other guests, but didn't bother to even acknowledge that we had come in. Ok... fine, she's busy. There was a server just standing at the host stand leaning on it, doing absolutely NOTHING who didn't smile, or utter a single word to us. I waited tables for FAR too long to excuse this blatant neglect in the service industry. If you're a hostess,  & you're busy seating other guests, look to the folks who walk in, & say SOMETHING! ""I'll be with you in a moment"" works just fine. If you're a server at the front, & you've got nothing better to do, seat tables, or at least GREET them. It's inexcusable to stand in the entry for over 5 minutes with 2 people nearby, & not even get a greeting. Not tonight. It was around 7pm, & we expected to wait, but we also expect to be acknowledged when we go somewhere. As a 10 year industry veteran, I'm not sure how these two women still have jobs.

The chicken tasted like something from a frozen tv dinner (and not a good frozen dinner but the kind we ate in the '80s that tasted like the box that they came in). Needless to say he didn't eat it and that defeated the whole purpose of me driving like a mad man to get his lunch to him hot and on time. Very disappointed that day.

There are two people, Angela Sevatson and Braulio Lopez, both Managers, that are clearly the hardest working two people in this place.  As I sat here I saw them filling in for servers, delivering food, and insuring each guest was made to feel like a VIP.
