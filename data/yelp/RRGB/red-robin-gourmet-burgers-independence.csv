Eric D.,"Kent, OH",116,106,97,4.0,9/25/2017,"The fact of the matter is that I do not like this location. I rather drive to North Olmsted where only once I was having an issue. This location has ruffled my drawers many times. The food is fine, but it is this guy named Chris and the last visit. Chris is always by the bar and I purposefully will move sections even if I have to wait when I see his mug. That being said, I have gone here many times and there is always something but rarely anything beyond a ruffling of my drawers. The last trip was good. Starting with Chris, I have this thing which I do not understand. They have a plethora of unlimited options. You can get the unlimited root beer floats, or lemonade, or a soda but that is not an 'and' aka you cannot substitute. So you better enjoy consuming a ton of ice cream if you start that way. To be honest, the location in North Olmsted never seemed to care if I wanted to have a float, then a tea, then a purple freckled lemonade or whatever it is called which is why I flock there. So Chris already ruined any whim of hope for a great Red Robin burger. Then I ordered the Garlic unlimited fries and when the time for a refill came it was you cannot switch, lets kill this fat kid's breathe so that the young lady he is with suffers like Chris's soul suffers when someone smiles. So I got pissed and I went outside and called corporate and found out that the sides CAN be switched but the drinks were not supposed to be. Okay. So the last trip, our waitress was cool and she said that since my dinner mate was getting fries that she would just bring out two so I can get broccoli and then have some fries. That is was cool and I tipped 25% because Nicol deserved it. However, the women that brought out the fries made a face when she dropped off two and saw my broccoli. You make-up laden charlatan, don't judge me. my turkey burger had TWO burgers, far as I am concerned I could have ordered several sides at once. If I wanted to be judged, I would call up my friends. Anyways, Nicol was really good but this Red Robin is just not as good as the one in North Olmsted. The problem of course is that I never drive and this one is a tinge closer to where I live and since I am not driving I cannot pick.  All-in-all I have never gotten the runs from their food but it would be nice to have some variety in life. If it is a matter of inventory or whatever, then make it so you can list a substitution and credit the orders. it cannot be that hard.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence
Jean J.,"North Royalton, OH",24,2,1,2.0,12/20/2017,"Not impressed at all with this place. Went last night for a burger and I love CHRISTMAS ale this time of year, if the bar tender is a true Clevelander. I had to send it back for them to rim the glass, then it came out with cinnamon sugar around the rim no sugar in the beer no cinnamon in the beer. Just a bad bartender. We ordered simple burgers that was mediocre at best. So for $40 we got two mediocre burgers, Stouffer's macaroni and cheese some french fries. Sweet tea and a beer. It was my husband and I so I guess it was okay to put us at one of those little 1/2 tables where you fee isl you have no room and definitely not meant for comfort. I have one nice thing to say is that the waitress was pleasant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence
Pat D.,"Aurora, OH",0,9,1,2.0,12/18/2017,"Love the food, just sad to look at my itemized receipt after the visit and see that I was charged $1.99 entertainment fee. I know this relates to the device on the table but t as we did not use it why should we pay for it.  Note to any prospective customers, keep an eye out for this. Truly distasteful to realize you've been scammed by such a seemingly reputable place, I guess all the $1.99s add up to more than what their customers' trust is worth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence
Leslie A.,"Cleveland, OH",19,113,114,2.0,11/26/2016,"Let me start by saying that we really enjoy a burger here if it is done correctly! With that said .... every time we come here they ask if we want pink or no pink - we say pink and get a well done over cooked burger. This is all after waiting 30+ min for our food to come out in the first place!! It's not like it has happened only 1-2 times.  Our server was nice but sooooo slow!! Asked to speak to a manager and he didn't care about anything. He offered to remake the burgers, as he should have, but didn't really care that it happened in the first place !!

You can tell just by looking at them they hate their jobs and would rather be somewhere else. Not only that but everyone was getting seated out of order lots of parties of 2 or 3 so not much variation in size and no excuse why someone who just walked in gets seated before someone who has waited their 15-20min.

Pat M.,"Beachwood, OH",0,2,,1.0,9/2/2017,"My husband and I along with another couple left their almost 2 hours ago. We ordered our drinks and then our dinner. While we were waiting on our food I observed 3 of the cooks eating while cooking and assembling plates. No one bothered to change their gloves or wash their hands. After I cancelled  everyone's order I asked to speak to the manager. I told him that he may want  to take a seat so I could tell him what I observed, but he seemed too busy to sit for a moment to listen to our poor experience. He offered to cover our drinks, but the bottom line is that people have to know that their food is safe to eat and people should be made to feel that what they have to say is important enough for someone in management to take the time to sit and listen to. This was a terrible first experience and I'm certain that we will never return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence

Our server was very good and was on top of her game. My family ordered the onion ring tower and pretzel bites to share. They were awesome. The orange dipping sauce that comes with the onion rings is amazing. For my entree, I just got a burger with just the cheese and a side of fries. The burger was delicious as usual and the steak fries were crispy and flavorful, especially if you add their special seasoning!

Sheena W.,"Rocky River, OH",164,383,1449,2.0,7/15/2015,"Stopped here around lunch time the other day for a co-workers birthday and I'll have to say Red Robin reminds me why I try to stay away from chain restaurants.  I decided to order the Prime Rib Dip and my co-workers got burgers and salads. The food seemed to take forever to come out, and when it finally did it was meh/okay - neither great nor terrible. If you order the fries make sure you get them crispy otherwise they come out like limp squishy sadness. I could describe the food in more detail but meh really sums it up the prime rib dip. Oh and make sure you get everything you ordered; I was supposed to get coleslaw with my meal but it never came even when I asked the waiter about it. Our server was okay, nice but not exceptionally personable or attentive as we had to ask for refills on our waters, extra napkins (am I the only person who uses more than one napkin?), there's that whole missing part of my meal thing, and overall the service was just slow.  Again, this place isn't awful, but I have definitely experienced better. Probably won't be back any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence

Josh A.,"Leesburg, VA",36,11,2,2.0,8/22/2015,"I chose to come here as it was near my hotel. Not having eaten any lunch, I was really looking forward to a burger and bottomless fries. As a reviewer stated, I was seated at a high table where I had to maneuver around the salt/ pepper shakers and ketchup bottle. My server never spent more than a second of time with me. She was unwelcoming and far more concerned with what the bartender thought of her. I had the whiskey bbq chicken and substituted pepper jack for the cheddar. It was as promised. As soon as I bit in, everything slipped and the sauce dripped everywhere. Mind you, I don't mind. I enjoyed eating it. The fries were tasteless, almost like cardboard. Shame.

C. N.,"Cleveland, OH",0,42,4,3.0,4/3/2017,"The old Red Robin set-up was great, but things have unfortunately changed for the worse since it opened. Their burgers used to be served wrapped in paper, in a traditional burger joint red plastic basket with a healthy portion of the bottomless fries. Their plating has changed to more of a ""trendy"" style, with odd rectangular plates, and the bugers are no longer wrapped in paper for easy eating, the bottomless fries are now served in those silver metal rings, and it is a very small portion. They have also become very stingy about refilling the fries, and they take a long time, and arrive in very small amounts. The whole point of Red Robin was good, cheap burgers and fries served in large portions, and their freckled lemonade and desert drinks (mikshakes, root beer floats, etc...). They are now trying to cater to a slightly more upscale market, and they are kind of taking the fun out of Red Robin. It's supposed to be a family friendly burger joint, not a higher end chain restaurant, so they need to try to go back to trying to appeal to their old crowd. They also changed their decor a little bit, getting rid of the goofy robin statues and trying to make the restaurant more ""adult-like"", which was not a smart business decision. The place is meant to be a fun place for families, and the old decor fit that much better than the newer decor does. The food is still good, but they truly need to increase their portion sizes back to normal and go back to their roots as a family friendly burger joint if they want to see bigger crowds like they did back when they first opened. Granted, there wasn't as much competition on Rockside Road back then, but Red Robin can still be successful in this crowded marketplace if it goes back to standing out as something unique.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence

Our last experience was definitely a 5 STAR visit but I wanted to take into account my last several visits. I ordered my usual Whiskey River BBQ burger which is a personal fav, requested as pink as possible. This request is typically difficult to please for me and the burgers come out dry as well as the burgers brought over to the table looking like they were just thrown together. That was not the case. The burger came pink, perfect, and had a high-end restaurant appeal to the presentation of the plate. It was extremely pleasing to see this was the case for all dishes brought out to the other tables. The service was quick and our waiter was extremely courteous as he was also a Purple Heart veteran who was medically discharged. Kudos to you and thank you for your service.

Even if you can eat a bun, you should still get it without one so you can finish the burger.  I must admit. I went to Wendy's today and realized I like their burgers just as much and they are much cheaper.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence?start=60

Michael A.,"Broadview Heights, OH",0,37,,3.0,3/24/2013,"The food is what I expected since I've eaten at this location several times before.  This time, however, it wasn't the food but other diners who cause the experience to be less than pleasurable.  I was seated next to a booth of 6 people (it appeared to be 3 couples).  From the time I sat down until I left (as quickly as possible I might add) these folks were loud, obnoxious and rude.  It was as though they were sitting on a patio somewhere rather than in a public restaurant.   And they weren't younger folks.  They were probably in the early 40's.  I mentioned it to my server who apologized but did nothing more.  I think the management of the restaurant should have intervened and asked them to quiet down a bit.   I do understand the restaurant would have been in an awkward position but they need to consider the comfort of all of their guest, not just 6 loud people.  I don't object to people having a good time when dining out but not so much so that it affects others around them.  I've been to a Chucky Cheese where it was quieter than Red Robin on this day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence?start=60
Rich L.,"Akron, OH",80,80,,1.0,12/21/2013,"It is with a heavy heart that I need to give this rrgb a poor review... From entering the restaurant at 515 when it was 3/4ths empty: 4 employees sitting around at the hostess station, i was the only group needing seated, yet we wait there circa 5 minutes because ""everyone is on break and noone can clean the table."" Hmm, is this a union factory and only a busser can clean up? Get off your fat fn as&s and get a table fn ready. Omfg.  Number of F's given between these 4 fantastic employees: Zero. Ordering... Took a while to get our order, 35 min, despite half empty store.  Asked server to bring an extra fries with dinner, but of course these came out two minutes later.....cold. Nice.  At least the burgers were good and cooked properly..medium was actually medium.  And of course, the fries that came with dinner were also cold. Helpful reminder to red robin mgt: essentially you need to do three things well: get me seated, make a good burger, and provide hot french fries.  Fail on 2 of 3 of the above. I expect a lot more for a 13.49 burger, especially with melt next door.  Not sure I would be back to this location. They obviously hit rock bottom on their hiring practices and also rock bottom on their level of giving a $&&$. And these are the kinds of people ""striking"" because they need 15.00 per hour.

Kyle S.,"Cleveland, OH",16,37,35,3.0,3/26/2013,We don't visit the franchise restaurants to often but Red Robin gives you a free burger for your birthday so we go twice a year. The burgers are good and every burger comes with unlimited fries. We've been here 4 times now and the service was good each time and it always had a good crowd.  Sign up for there email list and you can get the free burger to. They don't send tons of emails so don't worry about the spam. I'd eat here more often but like I said we don't like visiting the big chain restaurants. I'd rather spend my money supporting a small business owner. I suggest the burger with the egg on top.

Which still has me a little miffed. Maybe i heard wrong, but it sure sounded like it. Anyway.. Red Robin is great for kids. They have an awesome kids menu and my boys always find something they really like. I am in love with the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken sandwich. The bottomless fries thing is nice, but i have never actually refilled them, because i am stuffed by the time i am done.  The dining room is always busy and has plenty of stuff to look at. Usually very clean and I usually get pretty decent service. You have to remember when going here that you are going to an upscale McDonalds.. This isn't a date restaurant unless you are 13. If you don't have kids, this probably shouldn't be your first choice. They try to adult it up a little with the bar and foo foo drinks but in the end.. this is a kid restaurant that allows adults.  If you asked my kids, this would be a five star.. however i still dont know how these people sleep at night charging as much as they do for sandwiches. I think that most of the 2 star and under reviews are people who have a higher expectation than I did.. If you are looking for an exceptional burger or meal, than go somewhere else.. This place was was invented to cater to kids. And lets face it, they will eat gum after its fallen on the floor..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence?start=40

Red Robin, Red Robin, Send Service Right Over. I was with a party of 10 so I could easily understand the 35 minutes to wait for a table. We were seated on a long 'surfboard' table near the bar area.  We were cool with that.  From here things went very different than they did in 2009 and It would probably be easier for me to compare the two.  This is going to be fun, ready? 2009 server: This server was pleasant, it looked like she was really enjoying being there. She greeted us with a smile and told us about the specials going on.  She said hello to our daughter who was two at the time - It was nice.  She took our drink orders and came back with them pretty quickly.   2011 server: 'Hi, Can I get you drinks?'  Not very friendly when complared to the first.   She too took our drink orders and came back with them pretty quickly.   2009 server: After she took our meal orders she asked us if we wanted to start with some french fries.  That was pretty awesome - they're  unlimited & refillable so why not - Nice thinking 2009 server!   2011 server:  She took our meal orders 2009 server:  When our order arrived my daughter asked my wife for her pickle and the server over heard this.  She offered to bring my daughter her very own pickle! WOW!   2011 server: Server wasn't friendly.  ""Your order is the next ticket up"",  Drinks ran dry.  She started walking away as we were talking to here.  Excuses but no apologies. Restroom were littered with hand towels.  First batch of fries were cold and undercooked. 2009 server: I was hooked.  At that moment even before eating I knew it was letter writing time.  This server deserved to be recognized.  This server was the reason we continued to go back to Red Robin on a much more frequent basis. 2011 server: Caused me to write this review.  Granted, I've been there many many times since 2009 but the level of service has declined each visit.  As a result the time between each visit to Red Robin has increased.

Aaron Y.,"Hartville, OH",5,24,17,2.0,5/27/2014,"I give one star to my waitress and the other star to the food.  My waitress was very responsive and friendly while the food came out quickly and was very tasty.  Now, with that being said I'm taking two stars away for cleanliness and one additional star for value.   With regard to cleanliness, our menu had a large hair stuck to some type of greasy substance.  Both the menus we were given felt like they hadn't been cleaned in some time.  They were straight up nasty and should be cleaned daily and as needed.  Also, the laminated drink flier on our table had a large smear of ketchup on it.  The next cleanliness item my son pointed out to me was that our table had several pieces of gum affixed to the underside.   Also, when we looked at the window sill that set against our table there was old food particles all along the length of the window.  The table also had a greasy/grimy feel to it, I believe the table finish could be the the culprit mixed with whatever cleaning chemical they use and when they combine the two there's a sticky feel to the table.  In sum, with regard to cleanliness the managers at Red Robin Independence fail to hold their staff to cleanliness standards and ensure that front of house tasks are completed on a daily basis.  There's no reason these managers can't hold their employees accountable especially when staff seem to have time on their hands as they converse in the bar area (not all the staff were lounging, just a few).  Instead of lounging they could be cleaning menus, tables, and the floor.  My last star being taken away is for ""value"", I had $30 tied up in two burgers, fries, diet cokes, and a tip.   The burger was better than a whopper and Big Mac (I like both); however, the fries were equal to fries at McDonald's and Burger King.  Thus, I'm left paying three times as much for a slightly better product in a store that has cleanliness .  Not a great value...my recommendation is to hit a fast food burger chain and skip Red Robin independence until they get the cleanliness fixed so their ""atmosphere"" can show value for their products, that's the only way they can improve unless they reduce prices to match their lethargy for cleanliness.  Best of luck Red Robin Independence, I could tell there were some good people there...you guys just need a good leader...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence?start=40

Manoa H.,"Cleveland, OH",114,61,58,2.0,6/26/2011,"Got takeout from this location the other night.  Was craving the Lola burger from B-Spot (cheeseburger with bacon and fried egg on top) so ordered the burger closest to it: the Royal Red Robin. The steak fries that came with the burger were tasty--seasoned, but not overly salted and still crispy even after the ride home.  Unfortunately, the burger didn't quite match the quality of the fries.   I asked for my burger to be cooked medium and it came well-done.  The texture of the meat was rather hard and crusty on the outside and rough all the way through--it was hard swallowing and I could feel it going down.  Thanks to overpowering, gratuitous gobs of mayonnaise on both buns, the bread was nearly disintegrated by the time I was halfway through.  Worst of all, the fried egg was well done as well--I was craving the creamy taste of a slightly undercooked fried egg over juicy, medium ground beef and got a rubbery well-done fried egg  over a crusty, hard beef patty instead.   Overall, for the price (about $10), the burgers and fries were edible but on the overcooked side.  I wasn't expecting B-spot quality, but as a place that totes ""gourmet burgers,"" I anticipated a little more finesse with their meat.  For future quick burger cravings, I might do better picking up a fast food burger and frying an egg over it at home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence?start=40
