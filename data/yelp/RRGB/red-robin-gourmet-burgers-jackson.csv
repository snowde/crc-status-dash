Matthew S.,"Richardson, TX",35,263,230,4.0,7/4/2017,"So I eat at Red Robin a lot. I do low carb and they are very customizeable. You can get a burger with no bun, wheat bun, lettuce wrapped. You can also get salad or veggies as a side.  The main difference depends on service. Seriously I have been to 3 or 4 different locations in the last few months. Service makes or breaks them.  Service here was a 3 out of 5 the main reason I give them 4 stars is due to food. They are consistent and work for my way of eating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jackson
Holly S.,"Dallas, TX",0,22,20,1.0,7/23/2017,"Ordered two angus burgers along with two kids meals.  About 10 minutes after ordering we here our waiter ask the table next to us wants their burgers.  We stop him and tell him he didn't ask us how we wanted ours.  We told him we both liked MR.  TWENTY FIVE minutes later the manager brings out our burgers.  Our kids were already done with their kids meals by that time.  The manager told us she took our burgers off the check.  We thanked her and began working on our food.  The burgers were WD.  When we were done the machine at the table would not allow us to pay.  After waiting another 10 minutes to pay, we dropped cash on the table and left. If you work at a restaurant known for burgers shouldn't rhat be a question you don't forget to ask???  ALSO, THE COOKS SHOULD KNOW HOW TO MAKE A MR BURGER.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jackson
Brigitte F.,"College Park, MD",66,3,,1.0,12/18/2017,"Asked for a vegan boca burger without cheese. Waitress later asked if I wanted a turkey burger or vegan burger. Again, I confirmed I wanted a vegan burger. I was given a garden burger (vegetarian, not vegan) with cheese. Waitress went to correct the problem, & I later received another garden burger - but without cheese. I just gave up and took it home in a box for my husband to eat. I know Jackson, TN doesn't have many vegetarians & vegans, but if you sell these products at a restaurant, please learn about the difference between vegetarian & turkey and vegetarian & vegan.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jackson
Brent P.,"Somerset, KY",1,146,69,5.0,7/3/2017,"I ordered the Smoke & Pepper, Teresa the Bacon cheese And Dustin the Burn N Love burgers.  They were absolutely wonderful!!!  Service is quick and very helpful. The root beer float and Raspberry freckled smoothies are great and bottomless to boot!! This RR made the trip from Hot Springs Arkansas so much more bearable.   A great place to stop for a break.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jackson
Tammy R.,"Dexter, MO",0,16,111,5.0,5/3/2017,"We came in kind of late and they were pretty busy. If I were a server, I might be kind of grouchy because it was about an hour before closing. They were SO NICE! The server was funny and so helpful. The food arrived quick and it was all cooked exactly as we wanted. We cleared our plates and we left very happy. I will definitely recommend this place to everyone and I will try to stop in again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jackson
Larry B.,"Jackson, TN",0,1,,1.0,11/11/2017,"Went there to get my free burger on Veterans Day.  Was seated quickly and then I waited.  After 4 other sets of customers were seated and waited on quickly I was getting a little up set.  When the 5th customer was seated and waitress was right there, I decided to leave.  I left explaining to the hostess that "" that's how I was treated when I got home from Vietnam"".  Thought I was over that but tonight sure brought all that rushing back!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jackson

Rem D.,"Little Rock, AR",87,28,4,4.0,6/10/2017,"First time ever eating at a Red Robin. Now I know what ""Gourmet"" means, add at least $5 to your check. I can't lie, the burger I got was tasty but I don't think it's worth the price you pay plus tip. I'd probably eat here again if someone else is buying otherwise it's too steep of a price and not a value purchase. If you go, get you some rasberry tea.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jackson
Mark H.,"Jackson, TN",17,63,115,5.0,4/2/2017,We really like Red Robin when we are super hungry. I like the chicken sandwich and my wife loves the whiskey river burger. Ask them to bring out fries before you get your food so you can snack on them while you are waiting. The shakes are great also.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jackson
Allyn H.,"Corinth, MS",0,3,4,2.0,4/6/2017,"All four of our tables burgers (supposed to be pink) were very over done. Service was bad. The buns were old and flaky. There were barely any fries on our plates, and the milkshakes were terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jackson
Cory C.,"Avoca, IA",52,8,1,4.0,7/17/2017,1st time eating at Red Robin! Burger was perfectly made and the fried pickles was on point! Never can go wrong with endless fries also! Waitress was extremely nice and made sure we stayed refilled,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jackson
Dan L.,"Tullahoma, TN",0,8,3,2.0,6/27/2016,"Not one to leave lot's of reviews, and certainly don't leave negative reviews, but here is an exception. Stopped today, just wanted a quick stop in a clean place with a good menu and RR usually fits the bill. Today was disappointing! We arrived at 1:30 after the lunch rush and it was apparent that lunch breaks or some break from the routine was underway... So we sat, and sat, and sat... As two of duty waitstaff sat behind us and the hostess fumbled around with menus, we didn't get as much as a glass of water. A harried waitress finally arrived and mumbled some apology.  Food met expectations, but c'mon now. Was there no shift manager today...no crowd, plenty of staff and a disappointed customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jackson
Mark S.,"Alamo, TN",23,15,1,1.0,3/15/2016,"The food is mediocre at best. It's burgers...nothing special. We have been several times, and each visit seems to be worse than the last.  Never a wait (or not much of one) which is a plus. The service is terrible. Our last visit will be our last, for good. They always screw up our orders, are slow, and dont believe in keeping drinks full.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jackson
Jann S.,"Dyersburg, TN",0,12,,4.0,5/25/2017,"I really like Red Robin.  I have never had a bad experience there.  It is one of the few places where every bite is delicious from start to finish.  The servers are aces.  I like the Banzi Burger and the fabulous onion rings.  One time I told my server I was depressed, and he made it his business to cheer me up.  I barely had a spine when I got there, but left walking tall and smiling.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jackson
Missy S.,"Port Saint Lucie, FL",2,6,1,5.0,7/26/2016,"Always delicious, service and food is always consistent no matter the day or time. We once left a bad meal at Applebee's to come here because we knew our experience would be top notch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jackson
Ray R.,"Anderson, SC",18,31,12,1.0,5/14/2016,Stopped in here with my family tonight and apparently they didn't have enough waitstaff to care for our needs. When asked how long the wait the kid couldn't answer saying depends if anyone comes to work. Place is a joke we left and went to Olive Garden,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jackson
Kimberly H.,"Greenbrier, AR",0,5,,4.0,1/6/2017,"Food was exceptional  - as always.  But, for the first time ever, our service was not.  It did not seem very busy but for some reason we had to wait a long time for everything - especially the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jackson
Miranda W.,"Brownsville, TN",0,6,5,3.0,11/30/2015,"The food never disappoints here, and it's the reason we keep returning. Back n Bleu burger is a must try if you like Bleu cheese.  On this visit, our server, who's name is Eva, happens to be rude. She suggested the new root beer float, which I'm know is part of her job, but she asked the kids if they wanted one. It's always better to ask the person paying for upcharges, if the kids want that. I had to tell them no, with her sitting right there asking them again, after I said no, if they were sure they didn't want one.  My 9 year old drank his soda pretty fast, so she brought out a full size drink, which was fine, but my drink was half empty at the time. I think it annoyed her, because when she brought my refill, she didn't say a word and slammed my drink down and walked off.  After a short wait, our food came.  The burger looked amazing, but It was missing the Bleu cheese sauce that comes on the side. I asked her if I could get some, and she tells me they stopped serving it. I'm confused, the menu specifically states that it comes with the burger. She says they stopped serving it because people were wasting it. So I ask, do you not have it anymore? Oh yes, they have it. You just have to request it. What is the point of going through the two minute conversation with a guest about how it's technically available if a person specifically asks for it, when they ask for it?  By this point, I'm convinced my server smoked a fat hog leg before her shift. It may be a while before we come back...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jackson
Mike P.,"Jackson, TN",0,4,2,4.0,12/5/2016,Great food and service. The Ensenada chicken is incredible. Tender and seasons perfectly. The garlic butter fries needed no ketchup at all. Great service from Eva. Back soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jackson
Dennis L.,"Paris, TN",0,3,,1.0,9/18/2016,We stopped in on Saturday for a late lunch.  The restaurant wasn't full but there were a dozen or more people waiting to be seated.   The hostess just stared at a tablet computer rarely make eye contact with the people in line to come in.  We finally made it up to talk to her and asked to be seated in the bar.  She said she would have to ask the  people that were waiting if they wanted to sit there first before she could seat us.  Now you would think she would have asked them when they came in if they wanted to sit in the bar since that area was practically empty?    The hostess was overwhelmed for some reason and couldn't make a simple decision so we decided to go somewhere else.  We aren't from Jackson but we had been here before.  The food was typical to that of other Red Robin restaurants but as I recall the service was below average at that time and the lack of wait staff was at the heart of the problem today.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jackson
Nate D.,"San Antonio, TX",0,2,,4.0,7/21/2016,"Good food and my burger was great.  Little slow in getting drinks to us, but everything else was fine.  Wasn't over the top experience, but really good food and friendly staff.

Mike P.,"Savannah, TN",8,3,2,1.0,5/29/2015,"The service is terrible here. We ordered beers on draft and they brought us bottles without the courtesy of notifying us that they did not have it on draft, when it clearly says on the menu that the beer was on draft. Not only that, we ordered three appetizers. Our waitress brought one of them out and we had to remind her at least three times to bring out the others. Also, the manager came and spoke to us. He is absolutely unprofessional. He completely does not understand what customer service is. Highly recommend not coming to eat at this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jackson?start=20

Jack P.,"Jackson, TN",8,7,,4.0,3/26/2015,"Every time I go here its good, but the burgers aren't very consistent. Sometimes the burgers are fantastic, but then sometimes they are ok.

Curran C.,"Cadiz, KY",0,10,,2.0,10/17/2015,"Supper time and crowded but no wait, staff was great.  Friendly and efficient. Food left much to be desired, If this hadn't been my cousins, who I see once a year, favorite hamburger I would have sent the chunk of shoe leather they served me back or thrown it away.  My wife felt the same and had hers put in a box for later disposal.  Nice atmosphere, great service and staff, food is not great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jackson?start=20
Dan D.,"Jacks Creek, TN",4,12,6,5.0,5/31/2014,"We had an awesome experience!  Our server Nikki was AWESOME!  We had the whiskey BBQ burger and chicken sandwich and both were great!  We had a giant stack of onion rings that were great by themselves but dipping them in their campfire sauce made them out of this world!  Also, the Parmesan fries were super!  When you go, ask for Nikki.  She was fantastic even though it was the end of her shift.  She said she loved working at Red Robin and it definitely showed!  We will return VERY soon!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jackson?start=20
Mandy C.,"Fort Myers, FL",380,298,872,3.0,3/10/2010,"Regarding the food, it is the standard Red Robin food.  Unique variety of burgers and sandwiches.  My husband loves the Royal Red Robin Burger because of the fried egg on it.  I love the grilled salmon burger.  I am not a big fan of the endless fries but you  can definitely eat till full if you want to.  I do however like the onion Ring Tower when craving a massive amount of onion rings! Now, since I travel to Jackson a lot to visit my family, I have eaten at this particular location several times.  Unfortunately every time I have received bad to horrible service.  It appears like every employee is either new, bored or  pissed off to be there.  But since it is one of the better places to have a family meal it is rather busy at all peak dining hours.  But the location is always very clean, food always served warm, so if you like Red Robin Burgers or haven't experienced one yet- give this location a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jackson?start=20

Amrita J.,"Duluth, GA",343,172,30,5.0,2/19/2009,"RED ROVER........RED ROVER....... Send a big thick, juicy hamburger....right over!!!!!!!  Ok sorry for the corny song to introduce you to this review.....but I had to grab your interest first right?!?! So let me start off by saying that sadly enough, prior to tonight I had NEVER experienced the joy and delight of a Red Robin burger, but after tonight, man do I want moreeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!  So I was debating where to eat here on Vann Dr. , there were so many choices, from italian, to fast food, to your chain restaurants, to steakhouses, to delis, I mean it is a hungry persons haven....... forgetting that it was a Friday night, and every place possible would be packed, I decided on Red Robin, due to the impatient part of my personality! Well I was taken to my seat, and looked at that menu, and immediately closed it, because I thought just looking at it was gonna give me a heart attack!!! I mean it had chili on one, guacamole on another, onion rings on another, I mean the options alone could kill you!!!  Well after searching the menu for something that maybe wasn't as fattening as the rest of it.....I settled on the Bleu Ribbon Burger, topped with onion straws, steak sauce, and bleu cheese crumbles.  Let me pause here by saying I have to give props to my wonderful waitress, who gave me a glass of there strawberry limeade on the house, because I told her I'd never been to Red Robin before!!!!  ** Which by the way was delicious!!!!!!** Well then out comes my burger and I thought I was going to faint due to it's ridiculous size, how am I supposed to even get my mouth around that thing???? But oh don't you worry, I managed, and I finished damn near the whole thing!!! (Yes, skinny people can eat too)......lol So needless to say, I loved this place, but I think my review alone speaks for itself !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jackson?start=20
