Dustin B.,"National City, CA",16,372,122,5.0,11/26/2017,"Had a good meal on halloween here.   The service was outstanding and the food was typical Red Robin, good.    It so far, is one of the better meals I have had in Jacksonville.    I will be going here again and I would suggest this place to others.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jacksonville
Aly W.,"Sneads Ferry, NC",149,60,199,5.0,11/25/2017,"I have never been to a Red Robin and been disappointed. My friend and I were immediately seated at a high top table in the bar area. Our waitress came over a few minutes later and took our order. I religiously get the bacon and Bleu Burger. It is french fried onions on the bottom, bacon and blue cheese on top of the Patty. The onion bun is exceptional! They never skimp on the blue cheese which makes me rather happy! My friend surprised me with a Not Your Father's Root Beer Float and it was delicious! Being a part of the rewards program for Red Robin is beneficial! They email you wonderful specials frequently and you earn a free birthday burger as well!  Lastly, the friend that came with me is gluten-free and they have bun options for her. From what I have heard many places have buns that are subpar when compared to a regular bun. Red Robin uses a bun that, as she says, is still tasty. Win!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jacksonville
Kim H.,"Jacksonville, NC",47,197,131,3.0,1/12/2018,"Stopped by for lunch to give this place another shot.  I tried their new veggie burger which was an improvement over the old one.  However, it was still mushy inside which totally turned me off.  I sent it back and ordered a guacamole burger instead.  Our burgers were ok but the fries were flavorless and undercooked.  It seems to be the opposite of our last visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jacksonville
Elizabeth M.,"Hubert, NC",143,122,547,4.0,8/13/2017,"The food was good however I feel like none of the severs are ever around unless they're taking your order or delivering your food. It wasn't busy but maybe they were all overwhelmed or something. They were nice just wish I didn't have to go looking for them when I needed something. We also waited at the host stand for a good while before we were greater. But when we were, we were sat immediately.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jacksonville
Rob P.,"Jacksonville, NC",70,289,241,3.0,4/4/2017,"Disappointed with what has happened with this location.  When they first opened years ago, I loved coming here for a fresh hot burger, now that I've moved back, this location must have new management and not care.  The hostess at front playing on their phones not even acknowledging my family walking in the door, and then the grease slime all over the table and dirty silverware to start off without even ordering food. The food was either sitting for a long time or reheated because everything from the bun to vegetables were soggy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jacksonville

J S.,"Greenville, NC",0,12,6,2.0,11/16/2017,"Not a good day at the Robin. Salmon was fishy and very dry(over cooked) my side salad came on a small square flat plate That was so small I could have counted how many pieces of lettuce were on it. They were out of broccoli which they did not tell me til after I ordered and then had nothing to replace it with . So they gave me more salad. This time in a small bowl which then forgot to put any dressing with it. The Cole slaw was the best part of the meal ! So, skip the salmon and salad and get the burger.  Like I should have done!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jacksonville
Patrik S.,"Jacksonville, NC",32,5,,1.0,11/14/2017,"I was there yesterday. Waitress was horrible, as soon as she found out I was there for the veteran free burger promo her demeanor changed. First she didn't bring us our drinks when we requested our drinks she forgets to bring straws, then she doesn't provide any napkins, then I politely ask for ketchup because there was none at our table. She comes back and ""throws"" the napkins at our table and walks off. My order was wrong a much cheaper burger than the one advertised online it was the taco burger instead of the double tavern one. I let her know. The whole time I refrained myself from saying anything to her because she was handling our food. My entire life as a consumer I have never had as horrible service as I did at this establishment. I used to be a regular for me and my family at Red Robin, NEVER AGAIN! You guys have lost my business forever. I'll be going to Ruby Tuesday's from now on. This is ridiculous, I have never been disrespected like this by anyone before. If she didn't want to serve me she should have just switched out with another waitress. Luckily I had my wife next to me to keep me from making a scene. But I guess that's what you get in city. I wish there was 0 stars, please be weary of this place they are not there for active duty and vets all they care about is your money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jacksonville

Mickey A.,"Wilmington, NC",124,83,86,3.0,6/4/2017,"I love Red Robin, but today wasn't my best experience. We waited at least ten minutes after being sat down before being greeted by our server. Once she started helping us, she was very energetic and knowledgeable about the menu. However, once our food came out, I was highly disappointed. Whether the fries are ""bottomless"" or not, the initial portion was a joke. We both looked up from our plates and laughed about how few we received. The burgers were both very good, but once we had finished our fries I was starting to get upset about the service again. Our server seemed like she may have had too many tables, and too far apart from each other. She was literally running around so much that she asked us how we were doing mid-walk, without even stopping at the table. So even though we wanted more fries we didn't get the chance to say anything, as she was already around the corner before we could realize she had said anything to us. Eventually, she asked us if we wanted refills on drinks and fries while standing at the table next to us, and a few minutes later returned to say the manager would bring them to us because the kitchen was being slow. So when the manager came out, he only brought the regular fries for my boyfriend, and not my garlic Parmesan ones which I only still asked for because it cost $1.50 extra. Those came about five minutes later, by the time we were already ready to go. Like I said, not my best Red Robin visit but I'll return at another location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jacksonville

Tommy S.,"Joliet, IL",5,10,,3.0,7/28/2015,"Having been to Red Robin several times before at other locations I'm a fan of the garlic and herb fries, the burgers, and the adult beverage selection is decent. At this location the food and beverages is good too. I have only been to the Jacksonville location three times. Each time there has been an issue. The first time the food came out cold. Both of the next two visits my order came out incorrect. The initial response is too replace the food with new food which I didn't accept because I dislike wasting food. All three times I was compensated with a discount or free fries.  Bottom line: Food is still delicious. Service needs improvement.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jacksonville

I didn't eat but the fellows next to us loved their burgers and milk shakes The place is managed well with focus on the small details. Like a placard at my bar seat honoring ""Larry"" for his loyalty. Never met Larry but made for a nice conversation with Lisa behind the bar. One of those small details I like is Wait staff wearing name tags. It just makes for a friendlier experience.  This is not your fathers red robin. Very modern hip and welcoming.

Yesenia F.,"Jacksonville, NC",0,9,,1.0,9/7/2014,Where is the zero stars button?!  This was the first restaurant we went to after being in Japan for 3 years. Big mistake... It kinda set the tone for Jacksonville. How wrong can you go with burger and fries? Not the Red Robins we remember from Florida before going overseas. We ordered a cheese pizza for our son and they sent out a pepperoni pizza after 25 minutes. He was the last one to get his food. We told the waitress we didn't eat pork and needed a different one. She was really nice and apologized for the mistake. My husband watched as she took it back and explained to the cook the mistake. The cook then removed the pepperoni with his hands and put it back on the counter so it could be sent to our table within a minute... All while my husband was looking at this. Words cannot express the disgust we all felt.  None of us ate our food. I cannot imagine what goes on where customers can't see. After complaints and apologies.. We received no discount!!!

I decided to use the to go service and try something new which was the Chili Chili con queso. I would not recommend getting this. Its a little different than any queso I've tried. Its almost like they were trying a new spin on it. And I'm not a fan. The Tortilla chips too will throw you off, they are cut into strips and are more like multi-grain. The thing that just amazed me though was the little bit they give you for the 7.00 you pay for the queso. I have no problem paying 7.00 for queso but it should at least be great. And to me it wasn't.

Nicole S.,"Nashua, NH",378,231,109,4.0,10/3/2011,"Red Robin never disappoints.  Last time we visited we were given a Red Royalty card. We activated it and found out we were able to get a FREE appetizer. So that's the only reason we went.... ...that and the Oktoberfest burger! We informed our waiter that we had the card and asked which appetizer we could get for free. You can get ANY of them! So, we chose the chili nachos. The order was HUGE and I was stuffed before I even got my burger. Our waiter time the meal perfectly, we were done with the appetizer before our food came out....which is ALWAYS a good thing! My burger was huge, the pretzel bun was pretty good, but it wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be. Kinda a disappointment, but I'm glad we went for the nachos! When it came time to pay, I showed my Red Royalty card and was STILL charged for the nachos. We got the wrong change back and waited around for a while before he finally came back to fix the problem.

Krystyna H.,"Jacksonville, NC",35,13,,1.0,4/21/2014,"How on earth does this place have 4 stars. Every time I go I wait an hour until I get my food, my drinks never gets refilled. I rarely see my server. I have given this place 3 chances to change my mind, each time business was very slow, so no reason for not seeing my server for 20-30 minutes at a time. And yes I timed it, not just guessed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jacksonville?start=40
Jennifer H.,"Gurnee, IL",159,648,1089,5.0,8/14/2011,"I love a good burger, and this place has good burgers--and it's one of the few places we've found that will actually cook you a burger with some pink left in it (even though they say they have to cook it medium). The bottomless fries are really good (be sure to ask for a side of ranch dressing) and you'll probably have to ask for at least one basket since you typically only get about 9 fries with your burger. But the service is quick, drinks are usually refilled without asking (that gets a full star in itself!), and a manager always comes around to ask how your meal is. It's also toddler-friendly, which is a bonus for us now that we're parents!  For what it is, I give it five stars--I mean, it's definitely no Ruth's Chris ( ) or Lolita ( ) ...but for a local burger joint that's kid-friendly? We'll definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jacksonville?start=40
Jenny K.,"Jacksonville, NC",225,109,86,4.0,11/19/2013,"Red robinnnn YUMMMM. Went here to get my free birthday burger (must sign up online first) even though Im not a burger kinda girl. But it was good, lots of burgers to choose from, nice family atmosphere, beer and alcohol =) , our server was very nice. This is a pretty big place and there are some games for the kids and lots of T.V's to stare at if you don't feel like staring with your dining buddies. Note; no entrance from inside the mall. I would definetly go again when Im in a burger mood! 4 stars because I think their burger loyalty rewards program is pretty COOL!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jacksonville?start=40
Regina T.,"Waldorf, MD",45,128,93,5.0,11/10/2011,"This was my first visit to the establishment.  After seeing the crazy commercials my husband and I stopped here for lunch.  I'm not a huge meat eater so I was really glad to see that they had veggie & garden burgers; they had soups and salads and wraps and chicken choices which is great.  I chose the garden burger, sweet potato fries and a very berry limeade spritzer-- the fries were endless and the drink - free refill! I was super stuff after my initial meal and my husband enjoyed his burger.  I really liked this and will return again.  Don't forget to sign up for the rewards cards- it comes with great deals when you do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jacksonville?start=40
Vinny S.,"Hubert, NC",1,6,9,4.0,10/23/2013,"Great family atmosphere during the day.  Service was ok, waitress waited until I finished the meal to ask if I wanted another beverage or just a water (lack of care for the most part).  They need more draft beers options added.  Both the BBQ chicken sandwich and the Fisherman's platter was served fast, fresh and delicious.  I will definitely be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jacksonville?start=40

Kylie J.,"Goldsboro, NC",9,35,,5.0,5/5/2013,"The onion ring tower is my favorite! The service has always been stellar, and the waitresses are so forgiving and helpful when it comes to hungry toddlers who can't wait for the food order. The recent waitress brought a small order of fries to avoid a terrible two's meltdown. We've always gotten fantastic service here. The place is clean and smells like good fresh food, not cleaning products or stale peanuts. I love the menu selection, and the waitresses know their products well when I asked questions. It's on the pricey side, but worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jacksonville?start=60

Jennifer I.,"Tallahassee, FL",107,648,62,3.0,6/11/2012,"This place is ok, your typical Red Robin chain. Don't expect amazing, expect average, just like all of the other chain restaurants in Jacksonville. If you like Red Robin for what it is, you won't be too disappointed. If you enjoy real hamburgers, go to the grocery store, buy some beef, and make them at home. You won't find a good hamburger in Jacksonville.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jacksonville?start=60

Alysia W.,"East Bay, CA",3301,592,72,4.0,2/21/2009,Had lunch here one day with a friend of mine and it was the same as any other red robin. I ordered the speckled strawberry lemonade which comes with unlimited free refills (yay!) and the bbq chicken burger which was amazing as usual. Their fries are really yummy so be sure to order a basket of those.. I believe they're unlimited as well? This location was packed cuz it's right by the mall so I'd avoid dining here during rush hours.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jacksonville?start=60

Heather G.,"New Bern, NC",0,19,,2.0,2/5/2013,"I have been going to Red Robins for years, but this is the first time I've been to this particular one and man was I disappointed. I always order the same thing - the crispy chicken tender salad with honey mustard dressing. I came in on my lunch break and ordered it to go. It took a while for me to get my food, even though it wasn't remotely busy inside. I was so hungry that I opened it on my way back to my office to steal a piece of bread that comes with it, only there wasn't any in there. And then when I went to eat the salad, ALL of the ingredients weren't even remotely fresh. The lettuce was on the verge of going bad, the bacon was gross, and the chicken tenders were cold (they usually come out hot and tasty). For an $11 salad, I expect fresh ingredients at the very least. The only thing that was good was the dressing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jacksonville?start=60
Megan W.,"Hamilton Township, NJ",12,92,15,4.0,5/5/2009,"Pretty good, as the PP said, it's pretty much the same as most Red Robins.  My ONLY complaint was that one time I ordered my beloved Blueberry Pomegranate Limeade and it was made with waaaaay too much Monin syrup.  Every other time, the Limeade was pretty good, so it must have been someone new.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jacksonville?start=60
