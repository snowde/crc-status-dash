Whitney J.,"Kennewick, WA",0,61,24,2.0,9/3/2016,"Pretty disappointed. We just moved from Seattle area and figured the red robin would be the same. They're so lax and unattentive here, it ruins the experience. We didn't get water until after we were half way through our main course from who we assume was a manager because he noticed us having issues. My husband had an empty beer glass sitting on the table for at least 20 minutes. The food was decent, but the fried shrimp tasted like it came out of a frozen bag. Our beer was stale and flat. We barely got any attention from beginning to end. Took FOREVER just to order drinks. And I'm still sitting here waiting to pay with cash and it's been about 15 minutes....

Ariel Z.,"Baltimore, MD",43,227,,2.0,10/27/2014,"We try not to frequent chain restaurants, but sometimes you just want a burger with all kinds of ridiculous stuff on it, so we just decided to go to Red Robin. We got a half stack of onion rings, which were pretty delicious (and piping hot), and then a guacamole burger for me, and a whisky BBQ burger for my husband. I wasn't really into my burger; I wanted something fresh (guacamole, lettuce and tomatoes - sounds good, right?), but the lettuce was all wilted, the tomatoes were grainy, and everything all together just tasted a bit sour. On top of that, the fries were a bit limp.  The server was nice but a bit distracted, which I can understand on a busy weekday night. Still, experiences like this just make me want to try extra hard to find a non-chain establishment next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kennewick?start=20
Jim P.,"Richland, WA",0,6,3,2.0,8/29/2015,"Something rotten sitting at the table... Just had a wonderful lunch good service and good food. Server split an order and was very helpful. Burger was tasty. Fries were hot and milkshake was thick and very good. So why the 2 stars. Well I got ripped off by the new table tablet terminal. Thought we would try a game while waiting and it (there is apparently some fine print somewhere) so we got dinged for $1.99. Now $2 is chump change and we had a nice lunch.... BUT (this for the rocket scientist who set this digital thief up.) I don't  like being ripped off. If there is a fee for a game bring up a dialog box, don't just reach into my pocket. Game was pretty worthless in any case. If they want to encourage use of a terminal using it as a revenue source is not a good plan. TRUST is important. I don't trust Red Robin anymore. So what was the result. for this customer. Well we like Red Robin, and will likely return, but will skip at least one visit because we feel betrayed and deceived. Second, the plan is to save time and labor costs with the table top terminal. Sorry NEVER using the digital thief again. Give a sneaky device my credit card SORRY no way.

Amanda P.,"Hermiston, OR",1,37,9,1.0,7/14/2016,"Red Robin used to be a favorite of our family, frequented at least once a month, because of the quick refills, great food and attentive service. All of those things have ceased to be. On this last visit, we had to ask for every refill, twice, we wait over 20 minutes for food, of which the quality has severely diminished, and were charged for an upgrade of fries we did not receive, even though the server assured us that it would be taken off the bill. I told them it was my nephew's birthday, but after waiting for over 10 minutes after our plates had been cleared, and not seeing our server once, we gave up and left. This will be our last visit to this location, unless we see a drastic change in the reviews that are being left, as there are many other restaurants in the Tri-Cities worth our patronage.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kennewick?start=20
Scott N.,"Olympia, WA",0,26,5,3.0,7/12/2016,"We have been to Red Robin on several occasions and have been normally happy with the service, but things have changed with our last couple visits. It appears that the restaurant is under staffed and can't keep up with the demands of the clients. The food tasted decently, but it was hard to get any refills in a timely fashion. The server genuinely tried hard to meet our needs, but she had a large table top that she was trying to manage as well. I wish Red Robin had kept its location in Richland on Geo Way many years ago as it would have a steady steam of clientele especially with all the workers from Hanford. Overall, we only visit Red Robin on special occasions as it is loud, crowded and the service is sub-par.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kennewick?start=20
Jules S.,"Prosser, WA",9,80,12,2.0,7/24/2015,"Should be a 2&1/2 but I don't get that option :(  I really used to like Red Robin. You could count on everything tasting ""good"". I normally get the avocado burger but decided to go healthy and had the Caesar chicken wrap. It was...a 2&1/2. We purchased fries as an appetizer and had to ask out server for a refill EVERY time. Mostly because they gave us 10 fries at a time. Weird.  Have potatoes suddenly gotten freakishly expensive? Caesar wrap: bland chicken in a tortilla with Caesar dressing. Meh. Had the clam chowder which the server said was ""GREAT!"". ?? I rarely send food back, this chowder had zero flavor. I found 1 clam and 2 small potato chunks in a runny milk base. I exchanged for chili. A bowl full of hamburger meat in brown sauce. What??  So, needless to say I'll stick to burgers if I return.

Chelsea S.,"Monterrey, Mexico",0,62,15,4.0,9/2/2017,"I'm reveiwing for TO GO service. I used the online app to prefer the a1 burger with fries. I picked the 445 slot and i got there at 430 ish and it was done at 445. I ordered my burger with some pink but it was well. For red robin, it was consistent with the red robins have gone to in other states. I was somewhat disappointed that I didn't get a ton of fries-afterall if you eat in house they are bottomless. The burger was good with flavor. Fries were crispy outside and soft in the middle. I would not sit down and eat there, but if you want a burger a step above fast food it's nice yo be able to buy online and pick it up fast. I ordered at 415 for 445 and it was done in that time.

Donald N.,"Richland, WA",1,10,,1.0,12/16/2017,"Worst burger meal ever!  Got the lettuce wrapped burger w a side salad.  The salad was mostly the white portion of iceberg lettuce, slightly light brown at the edges.  The visual was completely unappetizing.  The point is that the kitchen should never have let that salad leave the kitchen. Now to the burger.  When I get a lettuce wrapped burger at Five Guys, the flavors are amazing and the burger patty has remarkable flavor for less cost. The burger patty was near tasteless and the toppings did little to help it. Not going back.  Thus is a high volume, not concerned about quality place.  If you need all those sauces and toppings to mask the blandness of the burger, that tells you all you need to know.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kennewick

Burger patty was in three separate pieces. Ordered the boss hog - it's got pulled pork! Who wouldn't want that? I got about 2 quarters worth of pork on there - yes, the size of 2 quarters.

Rick S.,"Richland, WA",0,3,,1.0,12/29/2017,"Call it bad luck perhaps but To be honest, I have always been a fan of Red Robin, but I have to say, Kennewick is by far the WORST service and the worst lack of common sense. Like I appreciate that they all are working and all have jobs but I have been there 5 times in the last 5 years, and EVERY time, I kid you not EVERY time they have failed on getting my order correct. I don't even order anything special, literally have gotten it wrong. One time, we went with some family from out of town, they wanted to go there, we all ordered, and for whatever reason forgot to put in my families order, our guests had their food, ate before ours came out, just honestly bad... I'll never go to that one again after tonight, we decided to call in and do a pick up order. Well, surprise surprise, they didn't know what no lettuce or tomato meant, the soup we ordered was literally a few tablespoons of broth, wilted Salad, and forgot parts of the order.

Tien D.,"Tigard, OR",112,336,429,2.0,8/13/2017,"Came here on my last day in Kennewick before heading back to Portland. I usually order the Crispy Chicken Burger every single time I go to a Red Robin restaurant....but on that specific day they had a picture of the Sriracha Burger as a special new menu item, so I decided to go with that. I should have known the photo was too good to be true. The burger that came out turned out quite soggy....similar to the quality you would find at a fast food chain. Also, the sriracha burger tasted nothing like sriracha. And that is coming from an Asian girl who uses sriracha daily. I was almost tempted to ask the waitress to give me a squirt of sriracha, or hand over the bottle so I can get the full spicy experience. There was no heat to the burger, which was disappointing. Also, after asking a passing waitress for a fry refill, I didn't end up getting it and had to ask another waitress a while later. Can't say the service is all bad, some waiters/waitresses were very attentive, others....not so much. Service was very spotty",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kennewick
M M.,"Pasco, WA",0,16,,2.0,12/23/2017,"I'll start with we have always loved Red Robin. My kids always want to go here. It is my son's favorite place. We have been to so many different ones a number of times. However, my last experience with this place did not go well. I ordered food for my family to go. When we got home they had not included the dressing for my salad. Annoying but I can deal. As I was looking over my salad the Chicken still had pink on it!!!!! It was not fully cooked. Luckily I always check my chicken now after a bad food poisoning experience a few yrs. ago. However, had I not checked, I would currently most likely be throwing up. Chicken with pink is unacceptable! This is the second time I have had chicken from this place with pink still on it. The first time was a chicken sandwich about 6 months ago. I didn't review at the time and let it go as a one time thing. Now that it has happened twice I feel the need to review.

Steve H.,"Richland, WA",0,43,18,2.0,5/11/2017,"Used to be fun to go to Red Robin, now it's become a bit of a let down.  The Kennewick location seems to have very poor service, we were at the RR in Spokane a couple weeks back and service, even though it was crazy busy was very good.  I can't say that about Kennewick.  I could year the table behind us had some issue that the manager had to step i to resolve.  Sitting near the kitchen (ugh!) we could year some of the staff complaining as well.   It drives me nuts when we place our orders and the wait staff that took the order is not the one to bring it, and we're forced to try to claim our food from a clueless food runner.   Wait staff didn't bring all the waters we asked for and only refilled one persons water after she asked.  There was no check in to see if things were cooked properly or if anyone wanted more fries, of course until we were ready to go.  We used to get the orders to go; but after a few bad experiences we've given up.  The last time the sent us out the door with the completely wrong order, but that time they did comp our meal completely. But this shows the lack of detail and attention, again its either understaffed or lack of training. I'm not sure what's going on at the Kennewick store; either understaffed or lack of training. But we've had our last 3 visits end up like this.  It used to be the apple place up the street was the questionable place, but they seemed to have fixed it.  Perhaps its the new minimum wage, but what ever the reason we're not rushing back to this location.  Red Robin also needs to update their menus for those watching things like carbs and calories. I'm shocked that they don't list either throughout and then on some items only calories.  Its time for RR to catch up with other restaurants and provide this for their customers.  Final gripe tonight was the loud ""drill"" sound.  At first I thought somebody was doing construction at 7PM, then figured it must be a blender.  But it was very constant and annoying. Turns out it's their new machine to blow up balloons.  Bad idea on so many levels.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kennewick

First, your greeter was very nice and said ""you can sit at a tall table in the bar!"" to which I agreed.  She then shoved a menu in my hand and pointed to where the table was. Ok, whatever. Lazy greeter. Then, I sit for ten minutes with some waiter guy walking by me no less than 15 times, and not even making eye contact.  Clearly, I don't exist.  No problem! I'll change this. Next, I decide I'm hungry and thirsty, and not willing to let this obviously lousy waiter ruin my night.  The bar now looks good, so I sit there.  The bartender immediately helps me...there is hope! Then, after 15 minutes, I get my lousy burger on a dirty plate.  Oddly, the key ingredient to this pineapple burger is missing--the pineapple!  I mention it to the bartender, and she immediately orders another and apologizes.  The garlic fries, so proudly advertised on the menu ARE A SCAM--don't do it; these are simply the normal fries, with a bunch of Parmesan cheese dumped on top with garlic salt?  Yeah, they suck.  They were also old, cold, and bland. Boo. And, then there is the kitchen.  This place is disgusting.  Don't do it.  It's a salmonella disaster waiting to happen.  Look around, look closely. Touch the menu, touch your table.  Now, go wash your hands. One star is for the bartender, who at least did her job.  Other than that, zero stars.  I rarely encounter a Red Robin that can get it right anymore...too bad! Good bye Red Robin!

Be cautious with the tablets there is a ""entertainment fee"" if used. Which no one cared to mention. You'll see it on your receipt after the fact. The service isn't any better. Every employee seemed miserable. I'm not sure where they were all hiding to be honest. We will not be returning. This place has gone down hill. I do want to say thank you for the balloons! That is the only good thing Red Robin has left to offer these days... I take that back. Second thing they have to offer are their chicken strips. Not bad. And to the young man at the front of the restaurant teasing my 4 year old because he was wearing an Angels hat. Grow up. You should ask to work in the back of the house so you don't represent your employer in such a negative way. Even my 4 year old gave you a look wondering why a grown adult was acting so childish and unprofessional. Go Angels! P.S. Our server was great no complaints there.

That's saying something because when I first moved here in 2007, husband's parents wanted to meet up here what seemed like every other week! Yes, some is better than others but overall no bad experiences. Biggest downside is how crazy busy they get, just like most of the chain places around town. Even on a Tuesday night it can be crazy busy! I love their french onion soup and for me I can never go wrong putting an egg on a burger. I want to love their ""finest"" burgers and the times we had them in Tennessee they were good, but here the ""smoke and pepper"" ketchup had very little smoke or pepper flavor. I do like the buns for these burgers a lot more though. Husband tried the southern charm burger at our last stop. The onions were great but the bacon is supposed to be candied and was decidedly not.

Walked in, waited to be seated....not too long, good, just wanted to sit and relax. Server came and took my order for a tasty beverage and since I was already decided took my order for the PRIME RIB DIP... Tender prime rib topped with caramelized onions, horseradish sauce and Provolone cheese on a rustic baguette with au jus for dippin'. Served with a side of coleslaw and Bottomless Steak Fries. That is how it Is presented presented (taken from the on line menu.) Sounds pretty darn good even now. What I was presented with would not have made the grade on the worst roach coach you have ever been unfortunate to eat from. Over view: it was COLD. From the bottomless fries to the rustic baguette to the fixings, the meat,  onions, the cheese was not even melted.  Only thing that made room temperature was the cole slaw. I actually watched the half cup of au jus congeal before my eyes. (It was actually moving in the cup)  I have eaten at several Red Robin restaurants across  country and just have to let this Red Robin know that the meal they tried to serve me was by FAR the worst ever offered.

Meanwhile, we watched her refilling the straws and going into the back room several times, so she wasn't even waiting on another table. The real kicker was that after she remembered us, she apologized and said she forgot us, but she took another 10 minutes to run our card and bring our receipt. We left SO frustrated.

The garlic fries I got lacked the garlic and were simply steak fries with Parmesan. It was embarrassing to taste and eat.  Chicken tortilla soup was delicious however I was very disappointed when my sister's bf found a dead fly in his salad. Lucky the waiter was on top of it and so quick to fix the problem and not charge us for the salad. My sister who's salad was fly-free did not enjoy it however because of the change in their salads. What used to be a big bowl of chopped greens was now some sort of romaine wrap that they were trying to say was a salad. This new salad is considerably smaller than their old salads and less flavorful. I am giving this place 3 stars solely on service of our waiter Jordan.

As for specific menu items, I love the freckled lemonade here.  They seem to get the balance of lemon and strawberry just perfect, and adding sliced strawberries to the drink is a nice touch.  Being bottomless, I always seem to have 3-4 of these per sitting.  It's like fruity crack in a glass.  The burgers, in my opinion, are just OK (I actually like Applebees burgers better), but the aforementioned house brand seasoning helps considerably.

""Why am I so fat?""      ""Red Robin.""           (roaring laughter) ""Who else should I invite to our wedding?""      ""Red Robin.""           (knee-slapping cackling) ""Why are all my arteries clogged with Crisco?""      (...you get the point) Red Robin keeps in tradition with most American family restaurants, like Applebee's, O'Charley's, and Chili's.   There are few surprises here.  You know what you're going to get the minute you walk through the door.  In my opinion, it's an Applebee's with better lighting, more kids, and occasionally some guy in a giant bird costume wandering from table to table. The atmosphere is fun if you're looking for generic ambiance, babies crying, and oversized menus.  Now is a good time to mention that I hate oversized, laminated menus.  They're always greasy.  And did I mention the giant bird flapping from table to table? ""Happy anniversary, honey. Want a picture with the bird?"" The menu is a hybrid of Applebee's and Chili's, without a real signature item.  I usually stick with the bleu ribbon burger (always just a tad undercooked than I requested) or the whiskey river bbq chicken wrap.  While the burgers are generally tasty, they're far from being ""the world's greatest gourmet burgers"" as the restaurant brags. Alcohol takes up a sizable portion of the kong-size menu.  A giant neon sign boasts of  ""the world's most masterful mixologists.""  Ahem.  Hardly.  If you can stand the embarrassment of ordering a drink called ""sand in your shorts"" or ""fruity boozie daiquiri,"" you'll likely be impressed at their appearance.  They also offer a decent selection of eye-catching nonalcoholic frozen favorites. In case you're wondering, the giant bird is not wearing shorts.  Is that some sort of health code violation? As you might guess, blue jeans, shorts, and dirty t-shirts are the normal attire here. ""Excuse me, sir?  Just because you're using a napkin doesn't mean you're not still picking your nose."" Don't take anyone here to impress them.  Take them here because you feel comfortable around them, or want a loud atmosphere where no one can hear her sobbing. I'm probably being too hard on the place.  I eat there often.  I prefer it over Applebee's.  They have decent burgers.  The service is usually above average.  Their steak fries are bottomless and very good. As long as you're in the mood for a chain restaurant atmosphere, you'll have fun. But don't be surprised when you visit the bathroom and find a giant bird taking a dump in stall #1.

I asked the hostess how long the wait would be, and she said 15-20 minutes! When we were seated, Edith was our waitress. She was not pleasant, at all. We told her it was my son's birthday so they would sing happy birthday to him. We got our food after waiting FOREVER (which, none of our plates tasted good). I reminded her 4 times that my children still hadn't gotten their drinks. They were finished with their meals and ready to go by the time she brought them, and she didn't even apologize. Honestly, that simple word would have changed everything. Instead she treated us like we were a bother. We didn't even wait after that to see if she remembered about my son's birthday, we immediately got up and left. The first thing my husband said to me was ""we are boycotting Red Robin.""

We had two kids at our table who ordered the mac n'cheese from the kids' menu and I had requested their refill come out at the same time as their food (because she'd been so slow). Instead of two dishes and two refills, she brought two dishes, and one refill bowl and tried to serve both baskets (with sides) to one kid, and the plain bowl to the other kid (without his side), claiming it was ""a double portion anyway,"" so we were getting ""the same amount."" I'm sorry, but we weren't concerned about the amount...we were concerned that you brought the order out wrong and expected us to just deal with it. Yes, I could have split up the ""double portion"" bowl you let the kitchen pass off to you, but we were paying to eat there, we should not have to do that. It seems petty writing it down, but seriously, her attitude over my questioning it was uncalled for.

My niece reviewed this earlier about the horrible service we received for a party of 7 with 3 children.  We were ignored when we were seated.  No one came and gave us water or drinks.  We had no silverware. After about 5 minutes or so the waitress finally came by to tell us she would ""be right with us"".  She left and we didn't see her again for another 5 minutes or perhaps longer.  When we came there was just one other couple and our party in this side (the bar side) of the restaurant.  A few minutes later, 6 men were seated and were served drinks and food before we were.  Other people came in and had drinks before us too.  Finally she came and took our drink orders and we asked for the bottomless fries.  She was snarky and pretty much said not a chance. They brought our drink orders and finally took our food orders.  When we finally got our food we asked for condiments and silverware.  The gal said sure but NEVER came back!  We waited at least another 5 minutes before the original waitress came back and we asked again.  I was shocked to see that the condiments and silverware were within a few steps behind the counter! As for the food:  The spaghetti two of the kids ordered had huge bowls of noodles but only a tablespoon or so of sauce, the noodles on the bottom were sticking together and impossible for the child next to me to pry apart - inedible. The vegetables on the hamburgers were wilted and nasty.  My hamburger tasted a little fishy - like they hadn't cleaned the grill in some time.  By the time we finally got the condiments and silverware, all the food was cold or barely warm. My brother-in-law received a different burger than he ordered and he said that was ""gross"".  When the manager came by, I brought up the problems we had to him.  He told me there was nothing he could do about that, and that there was an ongoing battle in the kitchen going on over the fries.  However, I happened to look up and see him yelling at the waitress in full view of the patrons in the other dining room and clearly from my vantage point facing the kitchen.  If that wasn't shocking enough, the poor waitress came back and proceeded to tell us that it wasn't her fault, she was a very good waitress with 20 years of experience and the poor gal began to cry.  The waitress and the manager never apologized, but instead pointed fingers at everyone else.  Whatever the overall problem is, it simply isn't worth it to go there and spend good money for food that is far worse and slower than anything I can prepare at home",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kennewick?start=100

Our waitress was more concerned with doing end of night duties instead of taking care of us properly, had to ask bus boy for silverware, I hate speaking up for things like that or seeing her elsewhere and getting her attention for pop or fry refills... At the end of the night she was so eager to get us to pay and finish up but worse was the fact that she asked twice if we wanted change back from cash! I understand she was hoping for a tip but it's very distasteful on her part, my friend paid with bills in order to get rid of some $1s and just get a $10 back. So our waitress gave her a $5 and five $1s back.... How rude. Was planning on leaving a bigger tip up until that point. In my opinion it's better to hit up these places when there busier, for some reason it's a better experience.

My daughter loved the mac and cheese and my husband ate 1/2 of his burger.  The plus was that all of us took home the rest of our burgers and ate them for dinner.  Red Robin is a good place to eat, but for 3 of us and a child, I think $50 is a little expensive for the quality of food we got.  The service was excellent, but being an experienced server in the past, it really is about the service and the food.  Too bad the food didn't match up with the service, thus giving this place only 3 stars this time.  I will be back though.  I love the atmosphere there and the wait staff is usually top notch.  Hopefully next time, we will get better burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kennewick?start=120
Tracy M.,"Kennewick, WA",0,5,,4.0,9/2/2012,"one of my favorite chain restaurants in town. Yes its loud but that is ok. I can deal with it. Waits at dinner can be long, but it is well worth the wait. Their food is just so good. The best burgers in town, I love the Bruchetta burger and garlic fries. the drinks for the most part are good. BUT I had a mai tai recently and it was just all alcohol and not drinkable. YUK! Otherwise everything is just too good. Daughter loves the whiskey river bbcue wrap. Sometimes it is really hard to pick a good burger as there are so many.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kennewick?start=120
Melissa D.,"Sunnyside, WA",1,4,,1.0,1/16/2013,"I should have known from the start that this would be a tale of woe. My husband and I had to run to the Tri-Cities (an hour drive from our home) to run a few errands and as we were semi-kid free decided to go to Red Robin for an early dinner. We arrived and there were endless empty tables (good sign, quick service, right?). After about a 10 minute wait we were taken to our seat and told our server would be right with us. A 10 minutes of seating we had our drinks arrive. First of all, my husband was given a diet soda, not a horrible offense, except that he is allergic to aspartame and it gives him horrific headaches. When we ordered our dinner we ordered a couple of sides for our 18 month old and we asked if we could get them right away (thawed fruit salad and precooked Mac and cheese reheated, not difficult). It was at least 15 minutes before those items arrived. My husband and I continued to wait for our orders of buffalo clucks and fries.    It was eeking ever closer to the 45 minute mark in the restaurant (remember it wasn't that busy) when our order came out. My first bite of chicken was cold like straight out of the refrigerator cold. I stuck my finger in the other pieces and the others were barely warm. My husband's chicken was the same as mine. Add to that approximately 8 stubby, mushy cold fries and that, my friends is when we sent it bak to the kitchen. And then we waited, and waited. Just as we got up to leave the manager brought out our food. Too late, we were on our way out. She offered to box it up for us (not the easiest things to eat in the car and we live about an hour from the Red Robin). She offered to comp us (good) but we only had about $5 worth of stuff. We told her what happened and she said the first round had probably be pre-fired and reheated before sent out (remember they were not busy when we got there). Ewww! She also said when our food was sent back it wasn't red tagged (I assume that means expedited,) so she didn't know there was a problem. She offered to give us a gift card, which she did. We were grumpy, hungry and wasted more than an hour of a limited time we had to go out and spend time together. And, to top it all off, the bite of cold chicken didn't ""sit well"" and I barely made it home. So, all in all, I have a $25 gift card to a restaurant I have no desire to go back to and food poisoning to cap off the night.

john S.,"Kennewick, WA",1,15,,5.0,9/15/2012,"I don't eat out often, but when I do its usually because we have a gift card, and that was the case today.  The food is good, nothing amazing but good.  Our server was nice, friendly and accommodating.  So all in all a 4 star meal.  When our bill came and we tried to pay with our gift card the server came back and said their internet was down and couldn't take the gift card.  Out of curiosity I called to get a balance on it to see if it was worth pressing the issue.  It was worth 3/4 of our bill so I figured I would ask her to try again.  She graciously said she would try again.  I saw her grab another employee who turned out to be the manager.  She walked back to our table a little later with the cash value of our gift card and informed us that the manager was able to do something for us even though their gift card processor was down.  The manager came over and apologized for the wait, which in my mind he did not need to do.  That is why they get 5 stars, Red Robin has been great to me and my family and I will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kennewick?start=120
