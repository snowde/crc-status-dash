Tiahna P.,"Killeen, TX",102,150,120,5.0,10/9/2017,"I loved this place. I had an absolute blast here. It was football Sunday, so I was shocked that there were so few people in there... But that's ok because I got to watch the game, in clear view, without feeling too crowded. I loved the atmosphere inside, so from the get go I was feeling pretty good. Even though the hostess wasn't too good because he was on the phone when we walked in and made us wait, as soon as we did get a seat, I thought the tables were all so cool, so many different vibes throughout. It only goes up from here people, so I'm talking to my date about how I'm a vegetarian and at most American burger spots I get a bunch of sides (ex. Spinach and artichoke dip, sweet potato fries, macaroni and cheese, nachos...) and I wasn't necessarily complaining. But as I've already decided the sides I wanted... BAM. VEGGIE BURGER. I was so excited! Not many spots out here have that, so I immediately knew I HAD to try it. Let. Me. Tell. You! I've been a vegetarian 7 years now, and this was by far the BEST veggie burger I have ever had. Vegetarian or not, it's something you want to try just because! My date, airborne, combat infantryman , you know protein beef beef, even admitted it was delicious! Definitely try it! Then, the sauces! They have soooo many choices, it was crazy I tried a bunch and was not disappointed at all. I've overlooked this little gem for so long, but I have now become a regular!  Service was good, food was great, atmosphere was amazing. See you soon Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-killeen
Ceze V.,"Temple, TX",15,178,45,2.0,12/10/2017,"I like Red Robin. I'm a loyalty ""royalty"" member whatever that means to you. It gets me a free burger on my birthday and they have some really good fries. But this location is on the brink of being closed down. You can tell by the limited staff to keep costs down. The lack of knowledgeable staff possibly due to retention turnover from tenured staff. The lack of care for patrons. Here's an example: before I signed in to write this review a special was available at this location but I was not offered it while purveying the Killeen location. Our bartender was amiable but that's where the buck stops, unfortunately. She wasn't rude in any way shape or form, she was just a bartender. She tended bar. She wasn't there to serve or take care of her guests by any means. My iced tea was done before my appetizer and was only offered one upon asking for our closing tab. Our bottomless fries took two requests to arrive. I wanted a beer but didn't have any face time to actually ask what beers they had to see if they could accommodate my black and tan request. They weren't slammed but they weren't exactly slow either but the time spent in the kitchen by the staff instead of the floor felt more like a UFC Fight Night or major NFL event taking place. No such luck with any type of good service, which is a shame because my best friend used to work here and make quite a living. Seems like the genuine service left with him.  I will take my business to the Cedar Park or Round Rock location because I have very little if any complaints or qualms with them. Even if a bit of a drive away. Shape it up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-killeen
Thane M.,"Alexandria, VA",0,39,7,5.0,9/23/2017,"We (family of four- two adults and two kids) went for Saturday lunch. Plenty of parking- quickly seated by the hostess. Restaurant is very clean- chalkboard games and a tablet on table to order food/drinks and occupy the kids. Pretty good beer selection and wine list- we had the fried pickles , followed by a burger with blue cheese and portabello mushrroms- good steak fries(bottomless- but I was full after the first) kids enjoyed the mac and cheese and corn dogs Service was friendly and fast-food was hot and well prepared   Overall- it was a pretty solid lunch- we would add this to our short list of lunch places in Killeen",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-killeen
Neal M.,"Austin, TX",432,794,107,3.0,1/8/2018,"I went to dinner with my friends and their kids a while back ago.  I haven't been to Red Robin in YEARS.  Well, I realized that I'm not really missing out.  The menu is as big as Cheesecake Factory but just burgers and fries.  It's really confusing because they have different ""types"" of burgers but they don't really explain what the differences are.  Some are larger, some are smaller, some may be a different quality of beef?  I dunno, it was option paralysis and I wasn't sure I was choosing the right one.  Also, being in Killeen, it's chock full of kids and families, so if you're not into that, avoid this place.  Everything seemed to be in a constant state of dirty too.  Could be because of all of the kids too but it was kind of startling how dirty things seemed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-killeen
Sara D.,"Harker Heights, TX",157,37,87,3.0,11/17/2017,Red Robin's was a last minute dinner destination. My family actually really enjoyed it.

Michelle J.,"Gatesville, TX",0,9,3,1.0,1/5/2018,"Note, it has been several months since we have eaten here and prior experiences were positive. After tonight, which was on a Friday night, we will not return.  Service was good however when a bill is over $70 before tip, for 3 people, you should be served quality food.  Tortilla soup was luke warm in temperature, salsa tasted like ketchup, and fish and chips was super greasy and tasted like it was reheated.  I could have spent same amount of money at a steakhouse.

Allie A.,"Killeen, TX",0,6,,1.0,1/12/2018,"Near death experience!! Would not recommend!! I went to this location with my boyfriend in hopes to receive the same great service I had received in Austin but boy I was beyond disappointed. I ordered a basic bacon cheeseburger but I requested ABSOLUTELY NO TOMATOES due to the fact of my high allergy to them and I emphasize it. I received my burger and of course it had tomato's on it. I had to wait for the waiter to come back and when I told him he said he told them in the back as well as writing it. My boyfriends food was right but mine had to be taken back and it came back out pretty quickly so in my head I did question it but was just going to take a bite but something stopped me. I lifted my bun and moved the lettuce to the side some and seen the tomato seeds in it then when I pushed the lettuce completely off I could see the ring in my cheese where the cook had just pulled the tomato off and sent it back out. I am severely allergic to tomatoes I carry an epipen with me, but that does not help much as I have had to be rushed to hospital and my stomach pumped as well as getting a breathing tube in past experiences. I would never go back here. The fact that they didn't take my allergies serious was too much for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-killeen
Mark R.,"Killeen, TX",1,17,49,1.0,7/23/2017,"My wife and I by fluke tried this location given that we are somewhat fond of good all American food and ""gourmet"" burgers like Guy Fieri onboard Carnivals ships but given our current location we were a bit limited in options and decided to give it a try. Boy it was a rude awakening, we were highly mistaken. Our experience took place on July 23, 2017 between 5pm to 6:48pm. The waiter was Elisa, the quality and service was worst than drive thru to include other competitive chains with substandard food quality.  I ordered a Smokey BBQ tavern double burger  that astonishingly required to be done three times because they either didn't know the difference between cheddar and pepperjack cheeses; randomly changed the type of buns and finally took out ingredients as if they were treating how many variables they can produce with food products and condiments.  Not trying to nick pick but they cycled through different burger buns as if it was randomly. I initially ordered onion grilled buns but somehow they changed the bread in round 2 when corrected and removed their BBQ sauce from the Smokey ""BBQ"" burger....in round 3. They slapped a burger that was not what I ordered and it only took about over an hour and 20 minutes to receive.  I had to request their sauce after the third try and created their Smokey BBQ double burger in my table given that either there is no communication in the back or their employees are completely illiterate.  I purposely did not mention how rude individuals were when they brought out my order. It appeared as a manager or supervisor brought out my burger in ciabatta bread and I politely inform her that that couldn't be my burger given that it was ordered in grilled onion buns and the only incorrect thing previously was the cheese. She then said your waiter requested this because you ordered it like this then walked away angry.  The waiter Elisa then mentioned, ""oh, I did request ciabatta bread,uh..."" Then walked away.  How is the customer at fault for the waiter not doing the basic elementary duties of writing down an order and then reciting or inputting it in their system correctly. I'm not going to waste time going into depth of how there was no service i.e. our drinks ran empty three times while we waited for our food and twice while we ate.  In regards to the dessert, they were modifying or check and we were not even able to order dessert through the table kiosk machine.  Elisa didn't return/service our table after the second incorrect order and we had to flag her when she was attending other tables to get any drinks and to order dessert. We ordered the dessert to go. Don't waste your time, the only pleasant encounter was with a nice lady that brought us the Smokey BBQ sauce that wad supposed to be in the burger. She deserves the star, the service and food quality doesn't deserve a single one.  Funny this is that after leaving both muy wife and I got sick. Nausea, etc. Don't waste your time or money in this establishment. It might possibly be an isolated event however we will not expose or risk further food poisoning by returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-killeen
Jay B.,"El Paso, TX",66,221,325,4.0,6/6/2017,"I first discovered this place back when I was living in North Carolina. So when I saw that Harker Heights had one of these, I just knew I had to get my hands on a mushroom Swiss burger to-go. I don't remember if they had it before. But now online ordering is a thing. And it's easier to use than that of Yahgi's pizza. But...I digress. Customization was easy and you can even order extra fries, in case you aren't able to enjoy their ""bottomless fries"" feature; which is only available dining in. Oh, and if you haven't been to this place before, you have GOT to try the sweet n' spicy ketchup with the fries. It's literally the only time I ever dip my fries in any kind of ketchup so...that should say something. The burger was as tasty as I remember it. One minor complaint is have is how quickly the bun can get soggy, especially if you ordered to-go with no lettuce. So I guess the tip here is: if you're gonna order a burger to-go, be sure to get one with lettuce on the bottom to protect the bun. Other than that, I'd safely say Red Robin is as good as they were in NC. I'd give them 4 steak fries dipped in sweet n' spicy ketchup out of 5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-killeen
Candace A.,"Georgetown, TX",4,10,,3.0,12/9/2017,"My family and I went for the first time in November. We stood at the hostess booth for about 5 minutes before someone came up to greet us and told us they would get us a table in about another 5 minutes... mind you, the place was NOT packed. Food was great but was not impressed with the service. We tried it out again last week.. we still had to wait for a table (which was dirty). The place did not seem busy (it was before noon) and we even waited for almost 10 minutes before the server came to our table! We gave this place a second chance... but I don't think we will be back!

Burger and as undercooked and the Patty seemed small for a gourmet burger.  Flavor was good they did have onions on a no onion request, but manager who brought it out did notice it  as he set it down and offered to redo it. The lettuce in salad was a wilted and the amount of the toppings was a bit skimpy.  The flavor was good.

Horrible place.  Left hungry.  Don't know or care if their burgers are ""yumm"" I know their service is ""yuck!""

When we got to the booth the seats were really wet from the cleaning towel they used and the table was wet as well so my first thought was ew they whipped the table with the same towel they wiped the seat with. It felt gross touching the table with our arms cause the table was still wet but it dried. The waitress was great she brought us silverware and we got them and there was food all over the knife.... and the forks looked really blotchy with dried water stains. We asked for new ones and she apologized nicely. Then we got our food and the plates looked really messy as well. Again with the blotchy dried water stains... the food was good but I kept thinking about how they probably just spray the plates and silverware with water and not even use soap and stuff to clean the dishes....

The food is delicious as it usually is, but a server who checks up on me, refills my water without having to find the server and who doesn't seem put out when I request something is representative of a great server; a server who should be the model of all armed Robin servers.  That server is Erika, and I will return so long as I get her for a server or someone with her impeccable serving traits. If this experience is just a fluke and I come back to the typical servers here who usually have their ""entitlement"" personality then I will only come back when you offer 1/2 off coupons as bad service at full price is not a value to me and my family.

I wasn't too hungry so I ordered cheese fries and boneless wings. The cheese fries were very dry and had slices of dry melted cheese on just few of the fries. Boneless wings were ok could've had more sauce and I wish the waiter told me it came with crumbled blue cheese cause I would've told them to take it off. My girlfriend had a burger that wasn't all that great she said, and she was never offered extra fries although bottomless fries came with her burger.

Cassie F.,"Harker Heights, TX",19,6,4,2.0,10/4/2016,"My husband and I had dinner here on 4 October 16 around 7:30pm. We were sat quickly. The hostess was friendly. Our waitress on the other hand... She walked up asked ""are y'all drinking tonight?"" I'm 37 weeks pregnant, so I said not me. She then asked my husband ""what about dad, are you getting drunk tonight?"" Hey said no. She then went on to tell us she was hoping she would get a table that would get drunk and leave her a big tip. So unacceptable! I had an email for a free Tavern Burger and fries with the purchase of 2 drinks and another entree, I asked to see if this location was participating in the promo, my husband told her what he planned on ordering (the mac and cheese tavern meal) she said she wasn't sure if that counted as an entree, but since she was ""the favorite"" the manager would do it for her. She brought us our tea, stood there for a second looking really confused, then said, ""oh I put your order in, but just so you know my kitchen sucks today, so if your order is wrong it was my kitchen, not me"" this was after she mixed up our drinks. My husband and I both have waited tables in the past, and couldn't believe the way she was acting. Her actions were so disrespectful to not only us but to the kitchen staff and restaurant itself. She made us so uncomfortable that we will probably not be returning to this location.  The food was ok, it has definitely gone downhill from when they first opened. My burger was ok, the fries were soggy and had no seasoning on them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-killeen?start=40

I had the mojito and she had the Mai tai.  The mojito was very good and I have rarely had a better one.   The drink selection is awesome and seems to offer something for everybody! We both wanted to try a couple of different burgers, so we told our waitress that we were going to order two... and then split them with each other.  When she brought them to us, we fully expected to have to cut them in half ourselves, but they were already cut.  The waitress told us they don't normally do that for presentation reasons, but she had explained what we wanted to do and they cut them for us!!  Both burgers were delicious!! We also shared two types of fries and those to were awesome as well!  We didn't have room for desert,  but promised ourselves we would save room for that next time as the choices look amazing!

We were seated immediately and our waitress greeted us soon after. She was a friendly and helpful waitress. She asked if it was our first time and when we told her yes, she explained how things worked. We Ordered the ""MadLove"" Burger with Pineapple and the ""Insane Romain"" salad. Damn. My burger came out perfect. It was delicious, moist and juicy. It was perfectly cooked and filled with so much flavor. The Grilled romain salad was perfectly dressed and tasted wonderful! We also ordered the Cupcake Milkshake and ""Towering Doh! Rings"" for dessert. It was just amazing. My husband didn't want to eat here at first.

Brenda A.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,9,2,4.0,11/10/2015,Waited at our table for about 20 minutes for service until we were asked if we needed anything from a waiter. She said our waiter was too busy with other tables. We didn't receive our food till an hour later. (Even though we ordered our food with our drinks.) We almost got up and left before we received our food but we decided to speak to the manager. The manager Billy was very nice and apologized about our wait and took care of our bill. The burgers where delicious. This is why I'm giving it 4 stars. Btw don't order the garlic and herb fries they are not worth the up charge.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-killeen?start=80
Gaby B.,"Harker Heights, TX",41,1,24,5.0,11/23/2015,Came here for the first time ever and I didn't know what to expect.

Julie B.,"Warehouse District, Austin, TX",0,6,1,1.0,2/20/2016,"I love red robin that's why I came here.

John L.,"Temple, TX",81,13,9,1.0,12/23/2015,"We sat down.  30 minutes goes by.  Then a waiter (the one serving every table around us) comes by and says that he's sorry for the wait with a plethora of excuses (not his table, the girl working the table left early...).  Then I ask him if they have a kids menu, to which he replies ""they didn't even get you a kids menu?"".  He goes away and after waiting another 5 minutes we decided to go to IHOP instead.  Before I left I asked for the manager (another 3 minute wait).  A guy named ""Bill"" came out and I asked him if he was the manager, to which he just extended his hand and repated his name again.  Instead of getting into a pissing match with him, I just smiled and explained my disappointment with his establishment.  He offered no comps or even an apology.  He just said that's not how they usually do business and offered to seat us again.  To which I replied ""The kids want to go to IHOP now,"" and he replied with ""well come back another time and give us another try"".  Needless to say, unless they offer me and my family a free meal or someone I'm with really wants to go, I won't be visiting this establishment anytime in the near future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-killeen?start=80

Mikki S.,"Fort Hood, TX",0,67,,3.0,4/5/2016,"The three stars are solely for the super delicious burgers. The service I experienced was horrible. It took a while I get seated which I completely understand being that it was pretty busy. I didn't have a problem with that. The waiter was nice, but was getting super close to us when he was talking and I don't think he understood it made us uncomfortable. It took forever for us to actually get our food and forget getting refills on our drinks. And I love bottomless fries but it took forever for some to come out so it wasn't worth asking for more. This place would probably be better to come to when it's not so busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-killeen?start=80
William P.,"Killeen, TX",11,22,,1.0,12/17/2015,"We had the worst service from the time we sat down until the time we left. We went there and they were pretty busy, but well staffed. Waited 20 minutes for a table which was typical for Killeen. When we got seated we waited another 10 minutes for our waitress. The restaurant cleared out quite a bit by the time our waitress showed up. She asked if we had been there before and and we told her that my wife had, but I and my son had not. She went over the reward program, which we informed her we already were members and that we should have our names in the system. She explained the free birthday burger and I told her it was my birthday, and asked if I would be receiving my free burger to which she rudely told me that since it was my birthday, that the staff was ""going to embarrass the hell out me"". I told her not to. Which she complied. We ordered drinks and waited 10 minutes to receive, and had to wait more time so the waitress could sing happy birthday to another table. We waited another 25 minutes for our food. Then waited another 10 minutes for fry sauce, 10 minutes after ordering a refill, received no refills on our bottomless fries, then took another 20 minutes to get our check. I never did receive a receipt, nor did I get my change back. We were very displeased with our service and will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-killeen?start=80

J. W.,"Killeen, TX",6,21,7,5.0,10/30/2015,"Beyond impressed..!!! If you're in the area looking for a new place to spend your cash, this is it..!! Extremely accommodating service from the front desk staff, personable waiters, courteous management and the food... Oh my goodness out of this world excellent. To start, the milkshake was delicious, the onion rings were perfectly crunchy and the dipping sauce is something spectacular, the whisky burger was quoted as ""the best burger I've ever had in my life"" and the southern burger with brown sugar and candid bacon was finger licking delicious. I am just so pleased that Red Robin chose our little city. Driving by these past months all I could think of was ""not another burger joint"" however, after visiting their soft opening today, I can say that this is NOT your ordinary burger spot. It's a great place to take your family or a date. I even witnessed the staff escorting people to their cars due to the massive storm. I do hope they continue to keep up the fine service I experienced today. One more thing.... The restaurant was a comfortable temperature. Most of our area restaurants have the AC set on -32 degrees and I normally have to bring a throw or eat with my jacket on, nothing is more annoying than eating uncomfortably. Overall, I give this place a 5/5. RED Robin yummmmm!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-killeen?start=80
C C.,"Killeen, TX",1,71,,3.0,11/22/2015,"This restaurant just opened at the beginning of November. I have been here 5 times this month. I sat both at a table and the bar during this month.  First a review of my food and drink selections. My favorite dish is the Ensenada Chicken Platter. The chicken was perfectly cooked and spiced (I love spice). The chicken was accompanied by a salad that was both fresh and flavorful. I also loved the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken sandwich as well as the salad of the same name. The Prime Rib Dip was edible, but nothing great. There was some gristle, and the meat was slightly tough. As for accompaniments, I usually substitute cole slaw for the fries. The cole slaw was good except for the time I got an order that was just shredded cabbage. I also got a Name That Burger. The burger was cooked as per my request. It was moist. Other than that, I didn't care for the burger because it was too bland for me. There was way too much sauce on the burger. For a drink, I had the unsweetened raspberry tea. It is made with Monin syrup which is one of my favorite brands. It was good. I also had the Fresh Lime Skinny Margarita which I chose to have on the rocks. You can also get it frozen. I love that drink. It was fresh, flavorful, and not too sweet. Be sure to ask for salt on the rim. Now for the service. Be prepared to wait...for everything. If you are in a hurry, go to another restaurant. There is a long wait for food. I asked for customizations on all of my orders. It was right 50% of the time. The best service I had was at the bar during dinner. There is a bartender who is truly amazing--Alyssa. She got my food and drink orders right, and she works as quickly and efficiently as she can. She also had to ring me out because there weren't enough pads for all the customers at the bar. Unfortunately, there was still a lot of waiting because they needed another person behind the bar to wait on customers--at least on Friday night. The worst service I had was at the bar during lunch which was much less crowded than dinner. I wasn't given a pad so I had to rely on the bartender to ring me out. First, she couldn't figure out how to do a gift card, and then she couldn't figure out how to get the membership number on the bill so I got credit for the visit. I called customer service when I got home to resolve that issue. Hopefully, service will improve with training and experience. I am not going back to eat for a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-killeen?start=80
El H.,"Pinellas Park, FL",0,3,1,1.0,2/9/2016,"I'd like to start out by saying that not all Red Robins are bad. But after waiting ten minutes for a shake, and then twenty minutes for a refill on drinks and fries, I don't see myself returning. It may be a busy Tuesday afternoon, but it doesn't mean we need to be sitting around waiting for what is supposed to be a gourmet burger. The technology you guys are using might be to help speed things up, but your lack of staff is slowing things down. Not once did I see a manager come around asking how things are going or I wouldn't be writing this review now. Here I sit, for an extra twenty minutes on top of everything, waiting on my husbands SECOND root beer float. If that even happens.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-killeen?start=80

Martha T.,"Copperas Cove, TX",0,7,,1.0,6/8/2016,"One of the worst visit! As a group it was our first visit and it was my first visit ever to a Red Robin (also my last). We asked for a table because some of us would have difficulty using their tall stools, so we had to wait. When we were finally seated, low and behold it was a very closed in crowded area with tall stools. The food was not very good and the service was awful! One individual in our party had to return her meal 3 times and it was only a cheeseburger, plain and dry. How hard is that?? She finally got her meal after the rest of us had finished ours. We repeatedly stopped different wait staff individuals because ours had disappeared. Our waiter finally showed up when we were ready to leave. We asked for our ticket. A couple of us wanted to pay with cash and he told us that we had to use the electronic pay. What??? Since when is cash not a good thing? My guess was that he wasn't capable of counting money.  I don't see this place staying open for very long if they continue in this manner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-killeen?start=80
