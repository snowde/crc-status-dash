Kati W.,"Denver, CO",2,28,6,3.0,6/26/2016,"So, I don't know why but there's something about this location that feels- cheap. The acoustics or something makes it feel like a child's play place where you have crappy pizza and clowns.  We sat in the back corner next to the bathroom, and again the layout of this place is just awful. The door to the bathrooms opens right at our table and on more than one occasion it swung into our table. It was enough to annoy me the entire time. Don't mind the ant on our table... Doesn't particularly bother me- but I could see how some would have a problem with that. Also, like the other location, it took the waitress about fifteen minutes to take our drink order. She was kind and apologetic, but still. Other than that, the food was fine and came out right and on time. But sadly, our ticket was wrong, just like last time at the other location. She fixed it, but what if we hadn't caught it? The food isn't good enough to bring us back.  Red robin, I believe I have given up on you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lakewood-5?start=20
Daniel C.,"Highlands Ranch, CO",24,3,,1.0,7/28/2017,"We went during lunch hour on a Friday.  Waited at least 40 minutes for food, with one iteration of a wrong order being brought out.  Furthermore, my cod sandwich had two small pieces of black plastic that I had to spit out after feeling a hard crunch while chewing.  No silverware or napkins provided until we asked for it.  Wife asked for ranch which  did not come until she asked again 10 minutes later.  Manager gave us half off but it wasn't enough to salvage the bad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lakewood-5?start=20

Jenny C.,"Golden, CO",152,578,110,2.0,11/30/2015,"We went on the second day of them being open to the public. My kids and I managed to get a table without waiting, which was a pleasant surprise. They have those tableside computer things, which is where we had to order our appetizer. Our service was good at the beginning, but it went downhill as we progressed. I ordered a meal with specific requests, and repeated myself multiple times to make sure he got it right. When my meal came out, one of the main ingredients (cheese) was missing. Our server brushed by our table to grab plates and didn't stop to see how things were going. When I finally got someone to stop, they brought out a slice of cheese. There was no offer to remake the dish, which would have been nice because melted cheese would have been better.  Lastly, we decided to order dessert to go, which we had to do through the table side computer thing. We specifically put it ""to go"" which was an option. A different server brought it out on a plate. I told her it was to go, and she took it back to the kitchen. Then she brought the same plate out to me with a to go box, saying ""they don't do take out orders."" Umm, okay. I had to awkwardly put the dessert in the to go box myself which was a pain in the butt because it was messy. The whole experience put a bad taste in my mouth and gave me indigestion for two days.

When I went to this location the burger I got sucked. The patty was a 1/8 lb cruddy costco patty with a bun that disintegrated upon touching. It took them 3 times to fix this burger. They did a great job the second time hiding the cruddy patty with more lettuce, 4 tomatoes, and a bunch of caramelized onions. Finally re manager brought the correct patty out. Apparently if you want a gourmet ""man sized"" burger. Go somewhere else. Luckily I had a small pile of 6 steak fries that came with my first burger to keep me entertained for 2 minutes.

If you do get to order, they will come after you have finished your meal. And we waited 20 minutes from the time we gave our credit card until she returned with the credit slip to sign. Don't complain to the person who claims he is the new manager. All you will get is passive aggressive, surly communication.

Anthony C.,"Golden, CO",0,19,11,1.0,5/21/2016,"When you see this on your map...go to the one in Arvada. There is nothing good about this place. Maybe 1 thing. The food came out quick but the table next to us sent theirs back twice because it was undercooked. so...??? Filthy- I don't think they've vacuumed the floors ever. The bathrooms were more disgusting than a truck stop. Our water glasses had a film on them and the table was sticky. Poor Service- Never got a water refill but thats ok the glass was filthy. Asked about beer special, she said there was none and they were $5 draft. Then we saw they were $3.50 draft on electronic menu. No smile from wait staff, very poorly trained. Came to table 2 times after food and thats it. We had a gift card and the electronic machine wouldn't take so finally after 15 minutes and asking a different waitress, we just left card on table. Food- Our bottomless fries were dark brown from being overcooked (all three baskets) bottomless fruit was have frozen and half soggy. The croissaint turkey sandwhich was so bland I need to dip in ranch with every bite, and the croissant was so dry it just crumbled up.

Kelly G.,"Denver, CO",0,14,11,3.0,9/11/2017,"I always love the food here. I think they have an excellent menu variety, from burgers to sandwiches, from soups to salads. And you can't forget about their awesome drink and dessert menu. But that's about all he positives, besides the fact that this new location is also clean.  Service is severely lacking here. When I say the servers here are order takers, I mean the servers here are order takers. No ""hello, how are you?"" Barely a ""how is everything?"" We waited probably 5-8 minutes before we were even acknowledge. I know corporate made the decision to add in the ziosks, but I think it's one of the worst inventions for restaurants. It's an excuse for servers to do less service, and it shows.  On the plus side, our food was quick to come out and was very tasty.

Jessica L.,"Denver, CO",84,145,40,1.0,10/1/2017,"Updating my review... this place has the worst and most inefficient to go process. Apparently they have a call center for to go orders? Not sure if this is all the time but one time I called a call center answered and failed to give the restaurant the order until I had already arrived to pick up my order. Also they moved their to go ordering to the host stand, which does not have a POS system, rather than at the bar. Makes NO sense because the person taking the order has to run back and forth with taking my payment or for whatever. I can never just pick up an order quickly. Something is usually missing, like a sauce/dressing. I haven't been to any other locations lately since this is closest to my house, but I hope they run a bit more smoothly than here.

Angela G.,"Denver, CO",4,5,,1.0,6/27/2017,"Lately the service has been absolutely awful here.  At the beginning of June we went for burgers on a Thursday after work - we waited 15 minutes at our table without even being asked what we would like to drink, all while the manager was sitting two tables over talking with an employee who was waiting for her ride. He offered her a beer, but we couldn't even get a water. We left without dinner.  Last Thursday, I met a friend after work. It took over 10 minutes before we were offered drinks. We ordered drinks and food at the same time. I went with the bottomless root beer float and a salad. The salad was fine, but the root beer float was definitely not bottomless. By the time I was offered a refill, I had finished it and the water that I asked for. The refill took at least twenty minutes to show up. My friend was not offered more fries and the ranch she asked for multiple times was never brought to our table.

Allie A.,"Tampa, FL",57,130,85,3.0,7/31/2016,"I typically come to this Red Robin location as it is close to my house.  It seems like a pretty standard location.  The wait staff is pretty friendly and the restaurant is clean.  I like coming here for a quick burger and milk shake.  The food has always been hot and comes out fast for me at this location.  I love the fries here and that you can get as many of them as you want with your order.  Last time I ate here, I decided to be adventurous and try the ramen burger.  It had pretty good flavor but the ramen bun did fall a part easily which made it a little difficult to eat.  The waiter suggested that I cut the burger into quarters which helped keep the bun intact. On a final note, I think that their table ordering system is pretty cool.  You can order appetizers and milk shakes from the tablet at your table without the waiter/waitress.  I think you can also pay your bill for the tablet although I haven't tried this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lakewood-5

The food was delicious when I took a bite! Everything I asked for was served correctly and it was still hot. The A1 peppercorn burger is my new favorite!
