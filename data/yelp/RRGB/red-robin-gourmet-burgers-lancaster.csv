Christopher C.,"Conshohocken, PA",168,1318,6419,3.0,9/19/2013,"This place personifies what's wrong in chain dining where you have some good points but also some really annoying bad points that equal out to a very uneven experience. Good:   The menu is highly customizable.   It has enough options that it should be able to satisfy just about anyone.   Our server ""M"" was absolutely a delight in every way possible. Bad: As Tom Petty once said ""The waiting is the hardest part.""  Let me expound:  First off when we got there this past Sunday the place was maybe 1/2 full yet we had to wait about ten minutes for a table. Why?  I don't know as there seemed to be adequate staff and there certainly was enough seating but we had to wait along with two other families for what seemed like no reason. After ordering the wait from the kitchen was close to 45 minutes. Mind you that's with a restaurant that's half full and no one ordered anything that was complex or difficult. As for the Ziosk, that thing is just friggin' stupid.  It's in the way on the table and other than being forced to use it to settle our bill I could care less.  No, I'm not going be tempted to order extra food and I'm also going to be tempted to buy games, music or the other crap on it yet even if you ask it cannot be even temporarily removed from the table. S-T-U-P-I-D With that rant out of the way....the food itself was typical RR quality.  Nothing outstanding but you could certainly do worse like if you went to the Temple of Swill across the street called Applebee's. The next time we're in the area and the siren song of chain dining comes calling, we'll certainly entertain the thought of RR but we'll also make sure to a lot enough time or else we might die of hunger while we wait for the process to unfold.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lancaster?start=20

Ray L.,"Somerset, NJ",1,13,18,4.0,12/30/2015,"It's a burger!!!

Morton F.,"New Castle, DE",83,922,3709,4.0,9/10/2014,"Let's start by noting that even in the land of Pennsylvania Dutch cooking, I go to chain restaurants, so my taste is questionable. Having said that, service at this restaurant was not only competent but exceeded my expectations. The server was attentive and anticipated that I would request a refill of fries and drink. (or maybe everyone does that at Red Robin) The food was about par for Red Robin, which is good enough. Only problem was the WiFi internet wasn't working. Not a strike against them since most other places in Lancaster don't even have WiFi, but I hope they fix it. Definitely would revisit when I'm in the area again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lancaster?start=20

Nina W.,"Gainesville, FL",77,9,2,3.0,3/25/2014,Solid burger. I had the Red Robin burger with the fried egg and bacon. The egg was not as runny as I would have liked it to be and the burgers favor wasn't enhanced or diminished by the additions. The service on the other had was GREAT!

Joanne M.,"Mt Joy, PA",0,3,,2.0,11/21/2015,"Food was good-no complaint there. But ordered a martini cocktail. The martini glass was barely 1/2 filled. It was a good drink, so ordered another but I expressed my disappointment at such a small serving & said only if it would be a full glass at no higher price. The drink came & was a full serving. Then the bill came with a surprise. The 2 drinks were priced the same but each had a $2 upcharge for citron vodka which I had not requested.

Rod S.,"Knoxville, TN",2,72,47,2.0,11/4/2013,"I had the vegan burger. I do appreciate that there is something on the menu for a vegan, but do you think you could put something else on the bun?  Maybe a slice of onion, tomato, pickles, lettuce? It was lonely looking vegan burger naked on the buns. I paid $8.79 for it, and my friend paid $7.98 for his tavern double burger (gluten free.) How can my lone vegan patty cost more than TWO meat patties? Maybe the meat eaters should be asking what is in these burgers that  two of them cost less than 1 vegan patty? Fries were good. They were out of Coors on draft. How can a bar run out of one of the beers they have on tap? It was a very confusing meal.  I'm left with lots of questions. Next time I'm filling my pockets with lettuce before I leave the house so I can dress up my naked vegan patty. I'd go there again if there were meat eaters in my group.  Otherwise, I'm staying out of here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lancaster?start=20
Michael P.,"New York, NY",34,306,6,4.0,8/20/2013,"Started the right way - with some pretzel nuggets. These are so simple, but delicious.  The cheese dip it's served with is great. I had a Blazin' Blue burger (something like that ;)) which had Bleu Cheese and bacon.  I had them swap out the onion roll for a plain roll and remove the onions from the burger.  I'm amazed by how eager to accommodate all your crazy needs Red Robin is.  I guess that's the beauty of each burger being made-to-order from the ground up. Service was lacking, seemed to have a poor attitude and made us ring ourselves up.  Strange.  However, other than that costing my experience a star this was a great time. The burger (and endless steak fries!) did not disappoint.  We need a Red Robin in NYC. Until then, we'll keep coming here every time we are in Lancaster.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lancaster?start=20

Thomas N.,"ASTORIA, NY",1,31,5,2.0,8/17/2015,Mediocre food. Burgers are massively over cooked and bland. Everything else is just meh. My big problem was the horrible service. Our waiter only had our table of 12 to wait on. Had to wait until 20 min to get any service at all. Then he took out drink orders and disappeared for another 20 min. After bringing our food we had no utensils or napkins took another 15 min for that. The worst part of this was that there are kiosk on your table which let you call you waiter. Clearly good for nothing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lancaster?start=20

I was ignored twice by the hostess stand, I must have interrupted their gab session.  Bar had room for us but couldn't get their attention long enough to order dinner. Table service ended up even worst. It took way to long to place our order. Fries came out soggy even after requesting hot crispy ones.

Foodie B.,"Mountville, PA",1,36,9,5.0,9/26/2011,"Our waitress exceeded our expectations. Went there to try the Oktoberfest burger but was reluctant to pass up on my usual Royal Red Robin burger. So Mrs. Foodie ordered one and I ordered the other and asked the waitress to cut each one in half. To our surprise, the waitress arrived a short time later with 4 baskets... Each containing a neatly- wrapped half of each burger and an order of fries. If you've eaten there before you know the wrapper plays a key role in keeping their burgers under control. We certainly appreciated the extra effort and advised the manager of his staff's attention to details sorely lacking at so many other chain restaurants. BTW:  Oktoberfest burger--- YUM!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lancaster?start=20
Tom D.,"North Wales, PA",72,307,2,3.0,9/18/2011,"We stopped at Red Robin for an early dinner while doing some quick shopping in Lancaster.  The restaurant was very crowded but luckily we were seated after only waiting a few minutes. The crowd only got bigger as we ate so go early if you're stopping on a weekend.  The waitress was very good and our food came out very quickly  I ordered a burger, because that's what Red Robin's menu is built around a it was good.  Unfortunately my wife's chicken tender salad came out with some of the chicken strips still rare in the center. This situation could have very easily resulted in a one star rating and a Yelp based verbal assault directed at Red Robin. We flagged down a manager as he walked by and showed him the problem. He saw the problem and took the salad away. Our waitress, seeing the manager at the table came right over to also see what the problem was and apologized heavily, even though it was in no way her fault. Fairly quickly a replacement salad was delivered to our table and it was nice to see that they replaced the entire salad and not just put new chicken on top which a lesser establishment may have.  In conclusion, Red Robin's cooks made a mistake which is going to happen from time to time. But they did a good job of rectifying the situation and for that salvaged 3 stars.  We would not avoid going there in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lancaster?start=20
Matt N.,"Harrisburg, PA",186,297,3656,4.0,9/25/2011,"I had an enjoyable time at Red Robin. I had been anticipating eating here since I saw a commercial with a juicy burger. There are good points and some not so good, but overall I think the good points were: the food is served at the proper temperature and tastes good and the service even while a little manic was attentive. It was a zoo - a little loud and super busy but we got our seats in 15 minutes and my son got a balloon on the way out so he liked it. I would go back, but probably not during a busy lunch hour on Saturday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lancaster?start=20

Erin H.,"Lancaster, PA",30,99,217,3.0,1/9/2018,"Will you get the best burger of your life at Red Robin? Not likely. But will it be cooked and made to your liking? Yes. The burgers here are consistent, and they certainly have every imaginable topping combination, which is great if you're dining with picky eaters or just those with varying tastes.  There are surprisingly some decent healthier options on the menu, too, if you're still sticking with those New Years resolutions - from bunless or lettuce-wrapped burgers to chicken salads and hearty chili. It's not a slim fast shake, but it won't cost you an extra session with your trainer. And for those that don't care? Nachos, onion ring towers, and bottomless fries. Never ending fries. ALL the fries.   This particular location can have quite the line, especially on the weekends when the Outlet shoppers are out and about, but they turn tables and get folks seated at a decent clip.  The one issue I have with this location is it's restrooms - they're always dirty, smelly, and wet. Wet counters, wet floors, wet walls... and if that's what the ladies room is like, I don't want to think about the men's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lancaster
Steve W.,"Lancaster, PA",0,14,,2.0,11/18/2017,"Had a small company outing at this Red Robin, about 50 minutes before closing time a few days ago. There were plenty of employees working, at least 10 from my count. However, many of them were just sitting around waiting to leave as if the place was already closed. We learned pretty fast that the place was basically half-closed. Tried to get milkshakes, but they were already cleaning the machine for the night. We ordered burgers and they were fairly good, but the parmesan fries were completely cold. I didn't think much of it, and my friend said you could get free refills on the fries. When we did order new fries, the waiter said no problem and went off. He came back and said they had shut down the deep fryer. I realized immediately that we had been served cold fries, made well before we even ordered. The waiter offered us a free desert as compensation, which was certainly better than nothing. However, I don't feel there is any excuse for deceptively serving customers cold food. Clearly the restaurant was shutting down well before their closing time. While I can understand it's annoying to have customers come in later at night, don't set a closing time of 11pm if you aren't willing to provide full service until then. There are too many good restaurants with excellent service out there to waste your time at a chain that serves you cold fries and pretends they were just made. Also, it's frustrating to see that many staff members just sitting around joking, while they can't even make a milkshake or fries during restaurant hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lancaster
Stephanie L.,"Philadelphia, PA",286,157,203,5.0,8/17/2017,"Red Robin never disappoints.  It is by far my favorite chain restaurant in the world.  It was great fallback for my friends and I when we decided to come to Lancaster on a friggin Sunday when all of the delicious Amish restaurants were closed.

As we were waiting for our table she and a male host began to touch one another. He was rubbing her arm, scratching her back, and playing with her hair.

Anthony S.,"Nassau County, NY",261,504,499,3.0,9/2/2017,"For basically a fast food burger joint, Red Robin offers a pretty solid burger.  These days you can get good quality burgers many places, but I was not familiar with the area and figured it would be a safe bet.  Their burgers come with bottomless fries, which sounds like a bonus but the initial portion is small, and depending on how busy it is, the server might not come around quickly as you might like for a refill.  On this visit I tried a mushroom and blue cheese burger and it was quite tasty.  I wouldn't make this my ""go to"" gourmet burger joint, but it really wasn't bad at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lancaster

We decided to go bunless (trying to be paleo/gluten free here) in addition to the burger we got two sides, salad and onion rings.  The onion rings were really good, fresh and large and fried nicely. The salad was eh, a bit bland, it was mostly just lettuce. The burger was okay, I'm surprised they don't cook anything lower than medium here cause I usually like medium rare. The guac was eh, it wasn't really stacked well with the burger, it was slabbed on and not the entire burger had guac in each bite.

Nota R.,"Chicago, IL",0,47,,3.0,9/9/2016,I have never seen so many screens in a restaurant. The tablets at every table. The TVs in every corner. And everyone at their tables on their phones. I had the classic Red Robin cheeseburger and it was solid. The bottomless fries are a great idea but only if you're sharing. Their children's menu is very reasonably priced. Also- they pump the smoke from the kitchen into the dining area so when you leave you smell like sautéed burger.

Bruce N.,"Akron, PA",5,54,5,4.0,1/11/2012,"great service, quick seating despite crowd, nice atmosphere, cool selection of beers on tap, and very tasty burgers.  My problem is the price.  When you get right down to it, it's a burger and a beer place.  My wife and I both had burgers - shroom burger was excellent - and unlimited fries,  I had one of them tall beers and my wife the gold margarita and some coffee.  And the whole shabang cost more than 50 bucks with tip.  Two people shouldn't walk out of a burger/beer joint  - minus 50 bucks.  I'll go back cuz of the shroom burger, but i'm still gonna be thinking about what a fool i am for spending so much money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lancaster?start=40

Allyson S.,"Lancaster, PA",2,2,,1.0,1/20/2013,"I don't need to come back.  Our server was polite and courteous.  I really can't blame much of our issues on her.  We had spinach dip as an appetizer, and when we asked for more chips, it took 20 minutes to get them.  By then the dip that was left was so cold it was gross.  Each of my 3 kids had corn dogs.  They came out straight from the fridge.  They were ice cold.  It took another 20 minutes to get hot ones.  I expected the manager to take something off the check for making my kids wait so long to eat.  Nothing.  She barely apologized.  I was severely disappointed with this visit.  We will not be back.  My burger was nothing special.  McDonalds would have been a step up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lancaster?start=40
James P.,"Felton, PA",0,4,,1.0,11/12/2012,Came in for Veterans Day free burger. Waitress said any burger was free to veterans. Ordered simple bacon cheeseburgers then when check arrived was told only $6.99 double burger was free. GM Paul Gilmore basically told us too bad the waitress made a mistake and billed us for the difference. Did not even come to the table but simply told the waitress to bill us. So much for honoring your veterans.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lancaster?start=40
