Cassandra P.,"Trenton, NJ",37,51,26,4.0,9/24/2017,I have been here many times. One thing I really like is that the service is really fast. I usually stick to the tavern doubles they are delicious.

Jeff S.,"Bucks County, PA",569,1716,407,1.0,6/19/2017,"We've been coming here for almost 2 years. My kids are still superfans because of the video games and kid oriented food but this place is beginning to wear me out.  We stopped in this past weekend right at opening and arrived to a mostly empty house. We were promptly seated and as we sat down I was surprised that the restaurant was so dirty. Our table was sticky and the chairs had crumbs on them. The floor was littered with food and paper. The kids high chair was sticky and full of crumbs.  We told the waitress and she came over with some dirty wet rag and wiped the table down. Thanks. Nothing better than cleaning up a food mess with a sopping wet bacteria-fest. I have to mention she did nothing about the dirty chairs, high chair and floor nor did she explain why the place was so dirty right after opening. Didn't they clean the night before or that morning?  Then there were the bathrooms. Also problematic. The men's bathroom in particular was revolting. There was unflushed business in the toilets. The smell was an abomination. The paper towel machine was empty. My wife reported that the baby changing station in the women's bathroom was dirty. Wtf is going on here??  I'm not sure why the place was so disgusting 5 minutes after they opened but it's seriously not a good sign. The food is average to begin with. Coupled with filth, you don't have such a great model for long term success. One star for Red Robin. Get your act together guys!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne

Debby H.,"Bucks, PA",2,151,19,1.0,8/25/2017,"I've been to Red Robin many times & yesterday was the last. Six year old grandson activated the ""entertainment center"" that cost $2. They refused to credit me. I didn't get my birthday burger ""oh well come before August 31"". My salad was bagged head lettuce, a tiny grilled dry chicken breast and tiny minced tomatoes for nearly $10. I'd asked for no cheese & it came to me with cheese and I had to send it back. The kids meals were ok although they said the Mac and cheese was cold. I don't like paying on the pad.

Ambreen T.,"Levittown, PA",15,3,2,1.0,6/24/2017,"Bad burgers and bad service. I ordered a burger to take home. It took half an hour to make it. Then when I got home, I got a completely burned burger.

Sari Marissa G.,"Philadelphia, PA",1625,945,7763,4.0,6/30/2016,"3.5 stars. Ok, so the vegan chick is going to review a burger joint. This should be cute. Red Robin, while know for their burgers and scrumptious endless seasoned fries, surprisingly offers a few delicious meatless options and a plethora of healthy ones too!! While I tend not to eat at chains, this is one I feel has a little something for everyone and this location's proximity to Sesame Place makes it a good post-park option for the whole fam. Would I go out of my way to come here? No. But I can certainly appreciate having it as an option versus amusement park food. A healthy one to boot. Awesome.  Besides having a tasty, pre-designed portobello burger meal listed on the menu which I sometimes get, you can build your own healthy burger with gluten free buns or lettuce wraps. They offer vegan Boca Brand burgers, grilled! Yum! You pick your wrapper, then filler, add ins, then sauces. Today I chose the Boca wrapped in lettuce with veggies (lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, cucumbers and pickles) and I added avocado for .99. It was HUGE and delicious! It comes with an endless side all for just for $10! I was very, very happy. I did get the fries because they are just so darn hard to resist so I'm glad I was able to go super low cal with the entree. FYI: The side of fries is 310 calories and the Boca is 100 so your meal comes in under 500 total even with avocado! If you are watching the scale, this is a great place to do so. Their app or site with Adobe Flash (in other words, not in your iPhone) allows you to build your meal and calculate exact nutrition info! They used to have this option for salads as well! I absolutely love this tool and it is a good example of why sometimes a chain can have some benefits a mom & pop business can't.  The kid's menu is a great one too! It offers more than standard kid's fare and each option is just $6 or less including a side and a drink! Pasta, Mac and cheese, burgers, grilled cheese, chicken fingers, grilled chicken and meatballs on a sticks because everyone knows kids, hell, even adults love things on sticks. I like that healthier sides are offered for the kiddos like endless broccoli, freckled fruit salad, side salad and mandarin oranges! Of course my kiddos opted for fries today. They are really that good! It is nice to change it up sometimes and throw in a green which they most certainly do.  They have endless drinks such as flavored fancy lemonades, milkshakes, fried apps and huge burgers with oozing cheese and bacon and such for those fortunate enough to not have to watch their waist. My hubby is one of these lucky fellas. #notfair  Oh, and their beers? They sound AMAZING!!! Funnel Cake and PB Chocolate Porter?! Seriously?!  Oh, and now they have a tablet thing at the table which is use to make paying your bill and ordering easier. I get that, but I actually found it to be distracting. The kids played on it and I kept having to take it away from them in order for them to eat. Also, it charges you $1.99 for unlimited games which I didn't know my sneaky 7 year old daughter hit ""agree"" to when we first sat down. Parents, I would say ask for it to be removed from the table right when you are seated. If they MUST bring it back for you to pay your bill, fine, but really my kids are just fine coloring the old school paper menu page. I actually commented on the ""lets have a chat"" section of the menu which asks ""would your rather"" type questions to ask your children. I thought that was really great! They didn't need the games. Less technology is better sometimes.  **If you sign up for their frequent fan card, you get a free burger on your birthday. Fab Philly Mom says: absolutely bring the kids!  Post Sesame too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne

Jeff B.,"Newtown, PA",63,128,196,4.0,7/8/2017,We have been to Red Robin probably at least 5 times a year. Always consistent on having a good burger. We have been going here since they opened in our area. Probably 20 years.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne
Marlyn V.,"Morrisville, PA",935,681,873,4.0,4/14/2015,"Don't let the cheesey commercials steer you away, this place actually makes good burgers! We came on a weekend in the winter and it was predominately empty, sat near the bar and had very friendly service. The decor of the place is cool, especially in the bar area. I haven't had a drink there yet, but they have happy hour all week with really cheap drinks (like $4).  There are CRAZY amount of options for burgers including a crab cake one! Here are the two we ordered: Guacamole burger: Huge burger, great flavor, sadly the guacamole was a little less then I thought and with the competing flavors of bacon and swiss it really just got completely lost. Not a bad burger, just too much going on to really enjoy the guac. We got this with fries, which were surprisingly good.  Royal Red Robin burger: I'm almost ashamed to order this burger because I know my heart slows down as soon as I start eating it. It is a deliciously large burger, with a fried egg, bacon and cheese all married on a perfectly toasted bun. Last time I had it, we at at 1 PM and combined with an order of the MOST PERFECT onion rings, it was the only meal I needed all day.  SKIP: The boneless buffalo bites, totally useless, cheap, but not very delicious, tastes like something frozen that's reheated. BUT if you have children, they are cheap and come with chips $5.  The vanilla shake, it was made with that bland generic vanilla ice cream, not like vanilla bean kind, so it was pretty wack, skip that too. I am hopeful about the fancy flavors and adult ones.  Overall, I really like the place, never a wait which is always a plus in my book and reasonable prices on good food. I'm sure I will be back soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne
Vinu J.,"Rhawnhurst, Philadelphia, PA",25,29,6,2.0,10/29/2016,Does Red Robin have something against serving HOT food ??  First thing when I sit down is I ask for a iced tea.  I ask for a iced tea and she brings me fruit punch. Already we have a bad start.  We asked for the wings appetizer.  The waitress brought it to our table and it was COLD.  Wtf?? Either the server just left the wings there and brought it after a half hour or they are feeding is left over from another customer.   So forget the wings let's go on for the main meal.   Order a burger.  Normally when you go to Applebee's or any other restaurant they bring it out sizzling hot. No not at red Robin. They don't believe in hot food. It was warm at the most. How the hell does the food get cold by the time you walk from the kitchen to our table ?? How ? I'm eating the leftover right now and I popped into the microwave and it's hotter than any of their food they served yesterday.   Forget Red Robin.

Amanda W.,"Medford, NY",0,6,,1.0,9/6/2017,"After being ignored at Cheeburger Cheeburger across the street, we came here and were told there was a 5 minute wait. Fine. 15 minutes later we were finally seated. (Plenty of empty tables...not sure why we had to wait at all). The waitress came over and made a big deal about bottomless fries as an appetizer and said we had to get them they're so good bla bla bla. So we said ok. She never brought them. We ordered drinks. We had 3 kids with us and they brought my 4 year old daughter's drink last when first rule at restaurants is to always bring the kids' stuff first. My nephew's burger was completely wrong...not what he ordered at all. I ordered my burger well done and the waitress even made a big deal about saying ""so no pink at all?"" and I said no. Well my burger came out medium rare with the sweet potato fries I ordered. I sent it back and after the rest of the table was done eating the manager finally came over with my well done burger but the wrong fries (steak fries instead of sweet potato fries). She said they were comping my meal for the inconvenience. We never received napkins and had to go behind the server station and get them ourselves. Our waitress had no idea what she was doing and was breaking dishes and glasses left and right. What a disappointing experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne
Charlotte D.,"Philadelphia, PA",87,191,50,2.0,7/13/2014,"I was highly disappointed with my experience at my favorite chain in the whole wide world. I have been to many red robins over the years and always loved it. I'm not sure if the cook was having a bad day or what.  I ordered the chophouse burger, which I usually get either that or the whiskey river burger. I ordered my burger medium well and added on bacon. It was supposed to be peppered bacon. I get my burger and tasted a piece of the bacon, and it was burnt. As you can see in the photo it was black. The waitress said she would get me a new burger, I just asked could the bacon be brought out. The bacon was regular bacon with a crap load of black pepper on it. I assumed it would be a gourmet peppered bacon.  So I wait maybe ten minutes for new bacon to put on my burger. As I start eating my burger, there is an overwhelming taste of burnt. I know the burgers are fire grilled but this was too much. I looked on the burger and the outside crust was black all around. I can only imagine what a well done would have tasted like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne

Jennifer J.,"Levittown, PA",30,7,,1.0,4/10/2017,"Well, server was great.  No issues there, we'll except when you want more fries. For a burger place one would assume burgers would be fresh.  But that is definitely not the case here.  Burgers were definitely frozen.   And I know this because I've been working in a restaurant for the last 22 years and I personally make the burgers each and every day.  Personally charging 10.99 for a frozen burger is ridiculous in my opinion.   Then there's the bottomless fries. Is it me or when you want more fries your server is no where to be found and when you do find them to order more fries it seems to take another 15 minutes.   I haven't eaten at red robin in like 5 years and now it's coming back to me why I've stayed away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne

Helena X.,"Langhorne, PA",4,90,40,2.0,11/2/2016,"I used to come here a lot.  Primarily in part due to my daughter loving this place, I on the other hand do not really care for chain restaurants, especially of this caliber.  However, more recently I have seen a steady decline in the quality of service and food.   Service:  There are some occasions where I get a great server but it seems like that is now a rarity.  From servers forgetting things, forgetting you are there (e.g the whole drop the food and run and never be found again type of thing) and the lack of personality.  Recently, the server wouldn't even let us get in a word in edge wise before trying to control the whole way we ordered.  I get you are busy but we are not incompetent can I tell you my salad dressing that I want before you try to cut me off when I am ordering the salad so I can inform you.  Can my friend inform you she does in fact want fries before you cut her off when she states what burger she wants before you start rambling salad, broccoli, fries, etc. - like this is not the type of customer service realm where you need to grasp control of the conversation and dominate, you are not a telemarketer trying to stick to a script, plus it was rather an aggressive approach to trying to control the manner in which we ordered.  I could see if I was trying to do a whole song and dance in the way I was ordering but I wasn't nor was my friend.  Like get over yourself - this recently just infuriated me, and this happened at the bar area.  I mean if the server is busy because she handles to go orders in addition to bar tables and those coming up to the bar then that is an internal problem and Red Robin should fix and address that.   Food:  Not that you could ever get an exceptional meal here, it is burgers and for the most part they execute that well.  However, the toppings sometimes are sketchy.  I have seen many pieces of brown lettuce on my burgers and salads.  Ask for your burger to be wrapped in lettuce and they give you this inedible concoction that is not wrapped properly.  If you cannot execute something that simple then don't offer it.  Fries are however great and I think their claim to fame.  Appetizers are basic and so are the desserts we almost never eat dessert here.   As a result of the service and the quality of the food I will not be patron this place anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne
Bob H.,"Byberry, Philadelphia, PA",50,447,528,2.0,2/10/2016,"We stopped in tonight for a quick bite after the mall. The place was dead, hostess wasn't around. Waited a few minutes for her to come from kitchen area. We started with the zesty buffalo bites, they were just okay, came in an order of 5 for $5.00. They were good but nothing to write home about. As for dinner my daughter had the Mac and cheese, looked like they just made a box of Kraft. She's 3 so it's not hard to please her. As for me, I ordered the southern charm burger. Was supposed to be one of their best, signature burgers. I wish I would have taken a picture. It was lackluster at best. First off it was very sloppy, looked like it was just thrown together. I ordered it medium, It came out well done. It was less then okay, for $14.00 I expected better. Another thing was the lettuce on the burger, romaine? Shredded, I'm not sure why they would do that as it all just falls off. It's so annoying! The bread was just okay, bottom portion was soggy and if your going to lather sauce on it, toast the bun. The BBQ sauce and mayo combo was good but way too much of it. The bacon was weird, seemed old and not enough caramelized onions. They offer unlimited steak fries, I'm a big fan of the steak fry. But they literally bring you out like 7 fries at a time. Kind of annoying.  Service by Jen was great, she was on top of it all. As for me coming back, I doubt it. I try to stay away from chains but sometimes it's just easier to stop. This is the reason why, inconsistent and subpar food. I also noticed the guy in the kitchen with a long beard he was not wearing a hairnet. It's should be common practice with facial hair that long. Solid 2 stars, just for service!

Gerald S.,"Newtown, PA",1012,2191,6425,3.0,9/23/2013,"While I generally like Red Robin Gourmet Burgers for the consistency of the food in all locations, I find that this particular restaurant being very close to Sesame Place has a noise level just on the other side of comfortable.  Given the choice I prefer the newer facility close by Neshaminy Mall, which although smaller, is more modern and offers a cozier roadhouse feel.  Too, perhaps because of so many kids eating grilled cheese sandwiches, the signature burgers often are not finished to the desired degree, and present in less than tantalizing form.  Last time I was here my server did not ask how I wanted my burger done. I volunteered that I like it medium, but it came out well done anyway.  Maybe that was why I wasn't asked.  I also was not offered the endless fries that are so heavily advertised.  The burgers are okay in both places and the fries still better than average. The shakes are a bit underwhelming compared to their competition at Cheeburger Cheeburger, Nifty Fifty, and Jakes Wayback. Better to stick with the alternatives like bottomless limeaid or iced tea, where you can hydrate without the sugar rush, and even share the drink if one of you gets water.   It is likely better to come to this shop after Sesame Place is closed for the season, and some quality control is reasserted.  This place is a gold mine usually filled to capacity.

Lena L.,"Manhattan, NY",35,424,30,2.0,11/11/2015,"Since we were in a hurry we sat down at the bar. The short haired bartender Jen smacked down some menus and kept on truckin. She spoke to the couple next to us three times without acknowledging we were alive. Is it so hard to say ""be right with you?"" We decided to start the timer on my phone to see how long she would continue to ignore us and she must have heard me say stopwatch and she came on over.  So let's take a turn towards cleanliness.... The menu was sticky and obviously wet. We watched the bartender take milk out that had black stuff on the bottom which makes me think there is mold in the fridge rubbing off on it. Then I had to pee and someone had exploded a toilet and there was paper strewn everywhere. And the worst offense, when our burgers came I asked for a knife and Jen had just started the dishwasher. She stopped it, pulled out a knife, wiped it with a dirty rag and then handed it to me. All right in front of me, we sat directly in front of the dishwasher.  You are only awarded the second star because the burgers were cooked perfectly and they accidentally brought extra nice hot fries for people that had already left.  We asked for the check quickly and thank goodness we did bc customer service super star Jen's bar tables has to chase her down at the bar just to get theirs.  Maybe someone needs a refresher on niceness, customer service, and maybe the whole restaurant could use a power wash.  I would not return.

My kids prefer this location because the mac and cheese isn't Kraft, but a thicker and creamier cheese sauce.  I got my usual Bunrin Love and it was the best I have ever eaten from RR. I was so impressed with the freshness and quality of the buger and all the toppings. My husband ordered the Prime Chophouse and said the same; the best he has had from RR!  The atmosphere was perfect with plenty of TV's, seats and a not too noisy crowd level which was great for a Saturday night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne?start=20
Stacy N.,"Fairless Hills, PA",26,191,226,4.0,3/26/2016,"Just returned from a jaunt to Red Robin. It is the day before Easter. Arriving around 6:30pm, the place was packed to capacity, but we were seated quickly. Husband ordered a bowl of chili and I ordered the burger with blue cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion straws, and chipotle aioli (and steak sauce) on an onion bun. No problem with holding the steak sauce and asking for a different bun than the one supplied with it. I was asked if I wanted my burger with ""some pink"" or ""no pink."" Okaaaaay. ""Some pink, please."" Our order arrived promptly, and the burger was juicy and tasty. Fries OK. I don't want to think about the calorie count of this burger with the aioli and the onion straws...so I did not take advantage of the additional serving of ""bottomless fries."" Husband liked his chili. Some plusses about Red Robin: there's a nice choice of substitutions for fries listed, a choice of sauces for dipping one's fries, and suggestions for lowering the calorie count right on the menu. The food looks appetizing as it comes out of the kitchen. Service was fine. A small tablet-console at each table allows diners to pay their bill at the table, order additional items, page the server, and play unlimited games for an additional $1.99.

Mike M.,"Staten Island, NY",0,8,3,1.0,8/14/2016,"We stopped in today for an after Sesame Place lunch/early dinner. The time was approx. 230pm and the place was half full at best -- we were able to find parking right in front and was told by our hostess (Katie) there were plenty of tables setup and available for us (4 adults, 2 kids, 2 high hairs). That's when the rudeness kicked in. My brother and sister in law tried to wheel their napping 14mo old twin girls to our table. The girls had just fallen asleep after a long, hot and overwhelming day at the park (they're first trip!). Tara the manager immediately came running over to let us know strollers are NOT permitted in the restaurant (mind you this is a chain restaurant servicing a children's theme park community). After trying to plead with Tara, even suggesting to move to an open/less populated section of the restaurant, my family and I were asked to leave. While I understand rules are rules, I believe that a good manager would have assessed the situation and realized that placing the stroller behind our table and away from any foot traffic posed no danger for the customers and staff. Red Robin I thought you were a family friendly establishment??! I hope other families read this and think twice about patronizing the Langhorne, PA Red Robin.  Sincerely,  Mike M.

I understand it is something that needs to be done, but I don't want to hear about it from the person handling our food... I don't know if you washed your hands or not, and besides, I am sure it was a cover for going out and smoking, which whatever, but come up with a less gross lie please!   The food quality was even worse than what I have had recently in AZ.  All of us that ordered beef sent it back because it tasted foul.  I understand that fries are ""unlimited"", but perhaps you should plate more than 8 on a plate with meals.

The burgers are the draw here - don't surprise yourself by ordering anything else. There's toppings of all varieties, and if you don't see a burger you like, have them custom-make one for you. I prefer the mushroom w/ blue cheese hamburger. The size is just about right, and their thick-cut fries are typically good (although one time they were a bit underfried).

A couple of minutes later as I was about halfway through my burger, he brought us the check which made me feel rushed and I found SO RUDE. A moment or two later, he came back to see if he could close out our check and I firmly said, ""No, I want to finish eating first."" He then asked if he could take my burger out of my way.

When we got to our table it was in a place where we had zero ability to use a high chair, and when we said something it was ""We have booster seats"". When it was mentioned that one of the children in our party did not do well in them, the blank look of ""what do you want me to do about it?"" said it all. We sucked it up, and our dinner was as awesome as you can imagine due to it. Actually, the kids did well, but the food was alright, they messed up our orders on a few things and were just generally meh to us. Our individual server was the only nice one there actually.

And a small detail, but still annoying: the Red Robin statue in the restaurant is located behind a customer booth in this location. Little kids want to see that statue, and the one we normally go to has it out in the open so little kids (like our own) can go up to it without bothering other people eating.  In addition, probably due to me asking to see a manager, our daughter was not offered a balloon as we left, even though she asked for one. It seemed like once I asked to speak to the manager, our waitress took notice of us for once. So sorry for being an inconvenience to her for wanting to eat at this restaurant, because that's what it felt like. Date of meal 6-17-14.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne?start=60
Jaclyn H.,"Lawrence Township, NJ",0,11,,4.0,6/14/2014,"This place is great, the food is always very delicious and consistent. My only reason for four stars is I always feel rushed out of the place. I'm usually still eating when I get the check, and than I feel obligated to hurry up and finish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne?start=60
Sean M.,"Folsom, CA",0,66,,3.0,4/23/2012,The service was pretty good. It's in a nice area by the mall and has a patio outside that's good for warm days. The food was decent - no better or worse than any other chain restaurant. They also had a pretty good selection of alcohol.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne?start=60
Rick K.,"Morrisville, PA",34,29,6,4.0,1/8/2009,The restaurant chain of Red Robin is one of my personal favorite. This restaurant just fuels my addiction to them. Great food is served fast here and they have a great staff that is very welcoming. There is not much else to say for this place. The only reason why I am not giving it 5 stars is because the giant bird that walks around and gives people high fives still kinda freaks me out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne?start=80
Angela R.,"Bristol, PA",0,37,,4.0,7/6/2011,"I am usually not a ""go out to a burger place"" kind of person but we tagged along with friends. We were greeted and we sat right away, which was great considering it was a weekend, our waitress could of been a bit more attentive though. During our time there we had to ask for refills on drinks which I hate! Our food came out fast and refills on french fries were great! I had the Mushrooms Swiss Burger, it was cooked right (Medium) and had plenty of toppings on it. Everyone elses food was good from what they told me. Totally loved the free refills on the fries especially since it occupied the 3 kids that were with us:) The french fry seasoning was good. Our ketchup bottle was empty and it took about 5 minutes for another wait staff member to bring us another bottle, yes another wait staff member not our waitress.  I would of given them a 4 star had the waitress been better but the food was good and we will go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne?start=80
Jeanne S.,"Newtown, PA",14,19,,5.0,12/19/2011,"This is the best red robin.  So much so, that I've been nothing but disappointed by all the others.  quick service, and they have a list of items they test out & aren't on other red robin menus.  I love that I can relax with my son & not worry about how loud we are, but you can still hear people at your table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne?start=80
Daria C.,"Yardley, PA",37,193,3,4.0,6/8/2009,"We go here about once a week. I love that you can order any of their burgers as a veggie burger wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun! Everything is delicious and portions are large. I also enjoy their salads. Their staff are friendly and attentive, and the food usually comes out quickly. Can't miss if you're in the mood for tasty and fast!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne?start=80
Michele H.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,157,1,4.0,8/30/2010,"I have reviewed RR before in NJ but felt compelled to review this location after having eaten there last week. We had lunch around 1 on Thursday and it was pretty slow. Our server was really great. He checked every item on our order to make sure it was gluten free. The chicken I ordered came out with seasoning on it (which was not gf) and he sent it back before bringing it to me. I did not have to wait long to get the new meal. If you have food allergies/sensitivities, I highly recommend this chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne?start=80
Joyce T.,"Fairless Hills, PA",0,8,,3.0,1/1/2013,Good burgers...too noisy...lots of tourists from Sesame Place...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne?start=80
Elisabeth C.,"Summit, NJ",338,376,36,3.0,12/13/2012,"We came her after being at Sesame Place. The burger wrapped in lettuce was really good. The fries were good, if a little salty. I also had a freckled lemonade, which I asked to be a third lemonade and the rest water and it was delicious but would have been far too sweet otherwise. I have been to Red Robin in the past and thought the onion rings were good and a shake delicious, but this time I only had the above, Our toddler was the happiest I have ever seen her at a restaurant. It was noisy and there was a lot to look at. She ate her mac and cheese and was exceedingly happy. Our server was adorable and super attentive. His name was Tim (I believe) and he was great with kids. I avoid chain restaurants on the whole, but I believe that different establishments of the same chain can vary hugely and I can say of the 2 Red Robin's I have been to, this was the one I would return to because of the service and the vibe of the environment. We were seated within 5 minutes, and the whole experience of being there was pleasurable. I will say that I know it is not the best food to eat, and that I felt kinda gross the next day, but it wasn't where I ate but what I ate that was the problem. I know they have salads there, I just wanted a burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne?start=80
Warren W.,"Las Vegas, NV",1113,16,12,4.0,6/14/2008,"Chain restaurants are the most exciting thing I saw in Trevose. Group of 50 searched for out of hotel dining, ended up here 3 times. Decent food, but clueless staff was the real draw. Served me a hot fudge sundae in a water glass, with just a hint of fudge sauce. When I asked if the water glass was the right way to serve a sundae, waiter came back with a plastic kid cup with more ice cream.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne?start=80
Dave M.,"Langhorne, PA",82,58,,4.0,6/27/2010,I love Red Robin - wherever they are. Their burger (the one with an egg on it) is great. The bottomless fries are a huge bonus...and freckled lemonades are to die for (and bottomless). I have two small complaints: (a) its sometimes too cold inside and (b) the music is too loud making it difficult to converse.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne?start=80

Melanie B.,"Huntington, NY",95,29,1,5.0,8/11/2008,"I'm from Long Island, and we used to have Red Robin available to us, but for some reason, they aren't anymore.  I also have 3 kids who wanted to visit Sesame Place, which happens to be VERY close by.  My eldest had recently viewed an episode of Jon & Kate + 8, and saw them have a meal at Red Robin, so she begged us to try it out. Home of the ""Bottomless Steak Fries"" is what caught my husband's attention!  The menu is HUGE!!!  There is something for everybody there.  They offered salads, burgers, and chicken.  Not many desserts but there's no room for them.  Our waitress was Kelly and not only was she sweet, but she was on the money.  Our order was taken correctly, our drinks were refilled timely, and our food was prepared quickly.  She made our Red Robin experience a memorable one.  If we ever get back to this RR, we will definitely request Kelly as our server.  We had a long day at Sesame Place and my kids were tired, but they too enjoyed every moment of RR without any problems.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne?start=80
