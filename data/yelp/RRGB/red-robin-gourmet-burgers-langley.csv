Arron M.,"Cloverdale, Canada",0,6,,2.0,9/24/2015,"Okay, so it's a family restaurant, I get that, but even on the bar side you can't escape the cacophony of screaming children.  Staff are decent, they throw a fake ""tip me please"" smile on like the best of them. They make an effort to refill drinks, but don't you dare ask for a refill on your ""bottomless"" fries, do that and you've lost them, they'll spend the rest of your visit dodging you. I've been here several times as my girlfriend likes the place and their speckled lemonade.  Do yourself a favor and do not order the blue cheese burger, pretty sure it gave me food poisoning. On a completely separate visit, my dad and I thought we would pop in for burgers. The place was practically empty and they sat us next to a little kids bday party, okay no biggie, ask to get moved, a big eye roll from our server later and we're on the bar side.  I order a beer and a guacamole bacon burger, burger shows up, I take a bite and the meat feels mushy... I look and it's neon pink, poke it with my finger, stone cold. I politely ask the server for a new burger or if they can cook it for a while longer, her response was ""well our burgers are medium rare"" I've eaten at Veras and other medium rare burger joints, this wasn't medium rare, this wasn't even cooked. Okay, stay calm, I ask to speak to the manager. The manager walks over, I explain the situation and her response was, ""well what do you want me to do about it?""..... Now I'm choked. Told her that she could either go and get me a cooked burger or just scrap the meal and I'd pay for my dad's meal. She replied with ""well I'll go get you another burger because I can't just give you a free meal"". The second burger came, it was cooked, I ate a few bites but had lost my appetite by this point. It was probably an off day...? Regardless, whenever this place comes up now as a suggestion for dinner/lunch I'm racking my brain to think of anywhere else. I fall just short of faking an injury and just falling over.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langley?start=20
Simmeri R.,"Richmond, Canada",1,1,,4.0,5/20/2014,"Went in with my dad on a Monday (long weekend) Usually I prefer non-chain restaurants as it can be hard for me to find food that fits with me being a vegetarian unless I want settle for a veggie burger but my dad really wanted to go.  We went during mid-day so it was rather slow, and the hostess was really nice and made sure that we got a good table. Our server (Darlene I think?) came by in what seemed like seconds after we were seated and went over the different drinks they offered sorting them into categories (Specials, milkshakes, favourites etc) which made it a bit easier to order drinks. I just got a water, as I had forgotten my ID :( but my dad ordered a milkshake that came right away and was quite delicious.  I was a little disappointed that most of the appetizers were either deep friend or not vegetarian friendly, but I suppose that just comes with the territory. Luckily our waitress was very accommodating of all of my requests/food mods. I got the Banzai Burger but with a garden burger patty with a salad and my dad got... some burger I can't remember with the bottomless fries. Â Both of our burgers were very, very good! The salad was alright, but pretty on par with what you would expect from a side salad but the fries were more squishy than the crunch I had hoped for from fries. Food 7.5/10 in my opinion but service was amazing. We sat near the window and it was getting quite hot with the sun shining right on us so our server had all the blinds near us shut so it would cool down a bit while we sat.  All in all, I had a better experience that I expected but it would have been nice to have a few more options for food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langley?start=20
Andrew M.,"Burnaby, Canada",0,4,1,1.0,6/19/2015,"I've always loved red Robin,I had one of the worst experiences tonight,I ordered the chicken fajitas and it arrived with a spoonful of cheese,sour cream was non existent,and the salsa was sitting on top of the lettuce,so I was not happy but I shut my yapper and asked for extra sour cream I would gladly pay for and if they could please bring me a little more cheese so I would be able to sprinkle a bit on each wrap,the server had to get the manager and the manager was absolutely horrible, told me they are premeasured and that's how it comes, so I showed him that there was no cheese,just a few teaspoons full expecting him to say,oh no problem I'll get you a bit more,I got attitude and I was embarrassed, I have anxiety very bad and I asked him if I could please just leave with my girlfriend, he then said and I quote""if it will make you happy ill get you more cheese"", I asked again if we could just please leave and we did,sad teally,I've been going to red Robins since I was 19,I'm 46 now,I have great memories there and I'm hoping other Ted Robinson are better,I'll give it one more go,do you guys remember the eggs Broadway burger from the eighties,bring it back red robins",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langley?start=20
Bethany W.,"Surrey, Canada",6,13,,3.0,7/24/2013,"My fiance and I decided to go to Red Robin for some caesers and fries/onion rings. It was a Monday night so it wasn't too busy that there was a wait, but it was pretty full. We had asked to sit in the bar area but the hostess said it wasn't open. We sat a booth instead which wasn't an issue.  Our server was very pleasant. We asked her what was going on with the bar. She told us that there was only one server who was also the bartender so they had to keep the tables to a minimum in that section. Fair enough. We ordered two caesers and water. The water came right away but the bartender must have been behind because it took a bit of a wait for us to get our caesers. Our waitress asked as if we had wanted to upgrade to doubles for $0.50 but they definitely didn't taste like doubles when we got them and they were short glasses! The food came quickly but we were VERY disappointed with the fries. They tasted very stale and not very hot. Just not very pleasant to eat. The onion rings were fine. They tasted great. Our server was good with checking up on us to make sure everything was okay. We didn't mention the fries, as it wasn't a big deal and we did notice the manager making several rounds around the house to apologize to other customers. All in all, it was an okay experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langley?start=20
Mira S.,"Surrey, Canada",163,193,30,1.0,3/26/2012,"I have gave this location many chances but I am in no hurry to return anytime soon. My hubby, stepdaughter and I used to go here a lot but each time, it gets worse and worse. We stood in the lobby for a few minutes before anyone greeted us. Then we were shown a table that we didn't want but before we can even ask her if we can sit somewhere else, she was already walking away. We ended up moving tables on our own. Then it took for fucking ever to even get service! When our food arrived, my burger was pink after I asked for it to be well done. I couldn't finish it. Fries were the only good thing. Everyting else sucked. I will drive a few extra km to the Guilford RR location next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langley?start=20
Jay Z.,"Mission, Canada",18,255,99,3.0,9/25/2012,"Went here with some friends a few days ago and Red Robin hasn't really changed too much. Upon our arrival we could see the hordes of families dining with their kids, yes it is a family restaurant but some parents need to control their kids. The wait to get a table was roughly 10 minutes which wasn't too bad of a wait at all. The table we got was a tight fit as there were four of us put into a booth made for two people, the bar would have been a better option by far. The leftover food on the floor around the place needed some urgent attention. When we sat down our server was Kelly, she was a very cheerful, bright, and pleasant server but was forgetful at times. Our drink orders were a margarita, two Dr. Peppers, and one rum and Coke in which everything arrived but usually when you order a soft drink you get ice in it as ours did not have any ice at all. Dr. Pepper could have used a pick me up as it was very flat and warm. No refills the entire night for the soft drinks but the waitress neglected the soft drink refills and the ""bottomless"" fries that were supposed to come with the meal. She did ask my one friend if he wanted another rum and Coke but not my girlfriend and I. Kelly, my dear, lose the cutesy bit and focus on remembering your orders!!!!  The food how ever was excellent as there were not real complaints, I will say that Red Robin is very consistent with their food and have never had any issues regarding it. The dessert could have been prepared a little bit better seeing that we got the Mountain High Mud Pie and the size came short of being a clump of dirt that little Johnny scooped out of the ground when he was playing construction. Last time we ordered it we needed four people to finish it, this time around it was just one, sigh!!!  The bad part like any family establishment was it was everyone's birthday that night, five to be exact and we even got to be a part of Kevin's 12th birthday as his table was beside ours and the Red Robin serving staff surrounded his table as well as ours. Having the birthday experience embalming you during your meal is very overwhelming as it tends to be annoying after hearing ""attention everyone it's ______ birthday"" Red Robin left me red in the face with the forgetful service, endless birthday singing, and a booth that was like a pair of pants eight sizes too small. If Red Robin was in a bird cage someone would definatly have to clean up the mess at the bottom of this one",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langley?start=20
Terry F.,"Bellingham, WA",5,38,3,2.0,3/13/2014,"I come to this Red Robin about once a month as it is conveniently near where I have a meeting. I really like Red Robins in general. I like the servers at this one. It's just the food that is hard to like. Tonight I had the Arctic Cod burger, the fish was without flavor and the fries were old tasting, dry and bland. It was like the fries had been sitting around for a while. I think next time I come to Langley for my meeting, I must find somewhere else to eat for a while, I just don't think I can do this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langley?start=20
Michelle F.,"Langley, Canada",3,39,52,1.0,4/15/2011,"This is by far the worst RR ever! The last 3 times we went there I had 2 cold in the middle burgers and the only one time it was hot inside was because I had to ask them to make sure it was hot inside before serving. I mean come on, cold in the middle burgers??? GROSS! I know they have ""bottomless fries"" but when there are only a child iszed handful on your plate and it takes 20 min to get another order it kinda defeats the idea in my opinion. The service is always a hit and miss and mostly a miss :( but yet they feel entitled to get a tip. I don't think so. Want a tip???

Diana B.,"San Ramon, CA",112,345,431,3.0,10/14/2011,"I used to go to Red Robin in California as a treat meal! I mean come on, bottomless fries, bottomless Freckled lemonade! You can't beat that, seeing as how both of those are delicious!  Burgers, from the past have been superb! But since I don't eat meat anymore, their seafood choices are excellent as well!  Just a fun restaurant overall. We don't eat here often, but when we do, we are pleased....  Fun for the kids for sure!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langley?start=20
Sarah A.,"Vancouver, Canada",33,159,11,3.0,2/16/2012,"Red Robin isn't really the kind of place I normally visit (at least, not since I was about 19). That being said, it's really not all that bad for what it is (a garishly decorated chain that is straight out of the movie Office Space...I kept waiting for someone to talk about their ""flair""). You can eat a ton of food here for super cheap (the portions are massive...MASSIVE). I hadn't been in forever, and late one night in Langley my friend and I were desperate and every other restaurant in the area had a 15 minute+ wait time to be seated, so we ended up here. It was actually kind of fun. The waitress was very friendly and our food showed up fast.

Inga K.,"Aldergrove, Canada",32,277,134,4.0,3/26/2010,"I just haven't given enough thought or respect to Red Robin and it got an extra star because I have been neglectful.  We take our kids here when we just can't face making dinner at home, or after Judo or just because we are out of groceries.  Last night we went because there was a big accident on HWY 1 and it was easier to go out for dinner than to fight our way through traffic from 232nd to 264th exit.  Soooo..... the restaurant is clean, the food is OK for what it is and the service was exceptional. My daughter asked me to mention that the Macaroni and cheese on the kids menu is the best she has ever had. (Better than Mommy's apparently).  My husband loves the bottomless fries concept, and I had their chili in a cup. Plenty for me... and it was $3.49!  Their customer experience is precise and well scripted to ensure you get everything you need pleasantly and quickly. It felt choreographed, which is good by me. I had a hungry five year old that just wanted his burger... we don't need a leisurely fine dining experience.  All in all we dined for $30 and everybody was happy. My son got his burger and shared his pickles with us all. That is a successful family evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langley?start=20
Anthony W.,"Surrey, Canada",37,63,8,2.0,2/3/2011,This has to be the worst dining experience I had at Red Robins. The serving and waiting staff were horrible. There was no queue and empty tables and we stood at the front for five minutes until the hostess appeared. The staff were quite slow when members of my party asked for condiments not Â at the table. The food was the only decent part of it all. I was disappointed since I'm a big fan of the Red Robin chain.

Susi M.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,2.0,1/5/2018,"We came here for my daughters 10th birthday dinner. We're new to town, away from family so hubs/I thought it would be fun to get a big ice cream sundae or brownie type dessert and the staff sing happy birthday to her. Keep it low key, but special. We ordered ice cream and the waitress asked if we wanted them to sing - at the same moment my daughter said no and I said yes. I said it again, very emphatically because that is really why we chose this kind of place! I said it again, 2-3 more times that yes we really did want the song and dance, whole shebang. Waitress ignored me, said I'm going with her (pointing to my daughter). Excuse me? I totally agree that kids lives matter but if a parent & child disagree, parent wins. I know my kid and she would've loved this experience but when you ask her point blank, of course she'll say no because it feels weird & embarrassing. Nobody orders their own birthday singers! I'm not even making this up but as we finished our dessert, the staff got the attention of the whole restaurant and sang happy birthday to a kid at the next table. Seriously?!? Our waitress came back and said ""my 3 year old just ignores me when I sing and we had a kid turn 5 last week and she screamed the whole time when we sang so I thought its just better to go by the kids wishes, sorry.""

My young son had wanted to eat at your establishment for many months... And, we had always found the parking lot full and the line-up too long to wait. We decide to give it a try this time... Unfortunately, the experience left us very disappointed. The waitress seemed more interested in her larger tables, to stop by frequently. More importantly, thee meal did not live up to the expectation of the description in the menu. The Black & Bleu burger was extremely salty and my french fries were served cold. My son's 5 Alarm burger was mild and not spicy, and was swimming in so much sauce to the point that the bun was soggy. The garden party was not overly flavourful. The refill of my root beer float came out in a dirty glass, and there was no clean metal forks available. So, I was given plastic takeout cutlery to use.

Glen D.,"Abbotsford, Canada",1,43,1,5.0,11/26/2015,"Red Robin has been around since the beginning of time and has been suffering from uninspired food offerings from a unimaginative menu. My visit with 3 family members recently was a treat in that they've finally brought their menu into this century with some very good options. My group had the Avocobbo salad: the beef dip; the popcorn shrimp and a gourmet burger. Without exception, the food was nicely presented and delicious. We enjoyed every bite especially the Fruffle desert. The newly designed menu has something for any taste yet sticks with re-invented favourites. Well done Red. The hostess and serving staff were all very polite and helpful without going overboard. The Robin is back on my restaurant rotation for sure. Not inexpensive though ... for example the Cobb salad is almost $15 as are most of the entrees. But given the quality of the experience, I didn't feel as if I was being ripped.
