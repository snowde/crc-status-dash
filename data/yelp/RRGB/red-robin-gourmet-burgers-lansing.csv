Bryan Y.,"Fort Wayne, IN",56,65,21,1.0,10/12/2017,"Unbelievable. Single diner and I come in and sit at the bar, I rarely take a table away from a server. I travel for a living and at times just like a chain restaurant to take some of the guesswork out of a meal. Having driven about 8 hours I figured it was time to make a stop. Red Robin has treated me Ok since my last bad experience quite a few years ago in WA, no fear as things have been pretty positive. BIG MISTAKE!  Please see the attached pictures. The first couple of pictures are of what I was served followed by what is represented on the corporate web site. The fries have NOT been touched, I was literally served maybe 10 fries. Thank goodness they are bottomless as it seemed the bottom had dropped out of my order. Please take careful notice of the wilted, brown, swampy lettuce that came on my gourmet burger. That too was untouched other than to lift it off of my pathetic gourmet burger.  Red Robin have you no professionalism? Red Robin have you no pride?  Your chain touts itself as a place for wonderful gourmet hamburgers and yet this is what you provide your customers.  The corporate site states, Our Leadership Their mission is clear: Make it fresh. Make it fun. Make it memorable. And above all, make 'em smile.  Fresh, no not really, look at the swamp grass passed off to me as lettuce. Fun? The fun has been writing this review.  Memorable? You have made it memorable for all the wrong reasons. There is no smile on this paying customer. See you later Red Robin. There are enough choices out there that a person would think a business as large and far reaching as yours would take the time to take care of customers with a decent product. You have failed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lansing

Akira D.,"Mount Pleasant, MI",16,36,53,4.0,9/19/2017,"People, be nice. This restaurant wouldn't be here if y'all didn't come out to eat. Remodeled or not- they have been in business AT THIS LOCATION for over a decade. There is nothing wrong with the quality of the food or service here. My bottomless fries were hot, my burger was average but I let it sit. I was served in under 15 minutes. The best part?

Alecia H.,"Holt, Holt, MI",0,1,,1.0,12/31/2017,"Went in to eat on NYE 2017. Got there just before they closed. Instead of good service i received constant reminders that they closed at 8, and rushed service. They started cleaning up around our table and hit one of us with a chair they moved. The tv's were turned off while we were watching them. They slammed our drinks so hard they sloshed over, and gave us our checks before we even had our food. Which they messed up on for 2 out of 3 of us. This was terrible service.

Robert G.,"Lansing, MI",0,11,4,3.0,6/9/2017,Disappointed. Not like it used to be. Remodeled the place and changed the staff. We came on a Friday night in early June  at about 7:20. One waitress about ran over me with a tray of food. Another one bumped in to me and didn't even say excuse me. Host initially sat us at a table that was not big enough for our family. In the bathroom one of the soap dispensers was out of soap. No hot water in the bathroom to wash your hands. Air conditioning was on full blast to the point our food got way too cold too fast.  Payton our server did and excellent job! 5 stars for Payton!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lansing
Don R.,"DeWitt, MI",0,5,2,1.0,7/21/2017,I came in got a burger and beer. I sat up at the bar and the bartender was friendly.  I ordered by burger and substituted sweet potato fries. When the fries cane out they were drenched in salt. I like salt however these were inedible.  The bartender apologized and ordered me new ones. After 15 minutes they never arrived. I then saw them sitting in the kitchen window. After another 8 minutes I mentioned something to the bartender. He apologized and brought me the salad that came with it instead. I then found a black hair in my salad. A manager came by and I mentioned something to him. He just said sorry and moved alone.  The guest next to me also had fries his were cold. I would suggest steering clear of this establishment. The quality has gone down along with management even giving a damn.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lansing

D M.,"Lansing, MI",0,28,23,4.0,4/28/2017,"Went out there today and the place was packed. Typical Friday. Walked in and they said 15 minute wait. It only took 5. Had a new server who did pretty well actually. His name was Sheldon like from ""Big Bang Theory"". I was impressed by his service being a new guy so I left a nice tip. Very attentive, especially for his 1st day. I thought they should've started him on like a Monday or Tuesday but oh well. Good job sir!

Rochelle A.,"St. Joseph, MI",0,9,2,4.0,4/15/2017,Great service. We were quickly seated and food came out at a reasonable time. Kids loved their Mac & cheese and fish dinners. Our burgers were scrumptious!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lansing
Amber S.,"Lansing, MI",84,11,6,4.0,10/1/2016,"While the food is always good, the service at this location leaves a lot to be desired. Our server was at our table every 3 minutes to take our order, which made us feel extremely pressured with 2 kids making decisions. After our order was given, however, we didn't see much of our server. We had to flag down other servers passing by for straws, napkins and silverware as none were given. Any requests or refills took at least 10 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lansing
Tyra N.,"Midtown, Detroit, MI",166,134,145,3.0,3/10/2015,"A fan since the early 2000's. Quality does vary by location. The variety in style of burgers is nice. The ingredients are on par with Applebees, Chilli's etc. So no, it's not farmers market fresh but it's whole food.  They are known for their bottomless fries and freckled lemonade for a reason. They're friggin good! They make a nice cocktail too. Seasoned fries are my favorites but the sweet potato fries give other chain burger joints a run for their money. My only critique is the meat, it's not seasoned well. It's more like filler for the rest of the ingredients. Having great cheese, buns and sauces makes up for it but I can definitely make a better tasting burger at home. I do order turkey burgers or chicken sandwiches so I am reviewing those only.  I lied, my other critique are the dessert options, they're limited and mostly chocolate or dairy.  Service is fast and depends on the location but I haven't had poor service at any Red Robin. Mediocre maybe but not even in my bottom 10. If you're in the mood for great fries, great lemonade, a decent burger, especially if you don't trust a diner in a business town, have Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lansing
Dan M.,"East Lansing, MI",45,63,40,4.0,1/25/2015,"I love a good burger! My wife, not much of a carnivore, had a rare laps from the routine and wanted  one as well. But not really. Thank you Red Robin for having great chicken options. She went with the whiskey river bbq chicken sandwich. Tangy bbq sauce, moist chicken breast, and crispy onion straws. Perfect sandwich. I tried the double tavern burger. Solid burger, good taste. Noticeably smaller then the typical gourmet burger offered. Really fast friendly service, thank you Michael! All together good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lansing
Jeremy M.,"Brighton, MI",81,13,1,2.0,7/4/2016,"We've frequented other Red Robins and its clear this location is falling by the wayside.  Burgers were over cooked, took 25 minutes to seat is and another 20 for the food to come out.  The place looks dated, tables are sticky, food was average by typical red robin standards.  Do yourself a favor and pass this one up for another restaurant nearby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lansing
Mike L.,"Hartland, MI",0,6,,1.0,8/4/2016,"This place is absolutely terrible. My family used to come in here and it has went so downhill! Took 10 minutes to be greeted and asked 3 servers to help us. Finally, our server got our drink orders and got two of them wrong.Our food came out with our appetizer. My daughter is a server so we tried to give them the benefit of the doubt but we just could not do it after awhile.Not only is the food over priced but it is so greasy too. The manager Tim came over and was completely rude and acted like he didnt see all the grease dripping out and the bun was a wet sponge.

Ron R.,"Lansing, MI",0,41,,2.0,7/8/2016,"Onion rings were very tasty.  Potato fries were excellent.  Hamburgers were tasty but way too juicy/greasy.  Service was not good, they did not even know what the nightly special was (ribs) and the server was clueless.  The boneless chicken tenders were bland and cardboard would have tasted more.  Cramped tables.  Too many fat people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lansing
Sarah R.,"Redford, MI",60,202,87,3.0,3/7/2016,"Service was very good. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. The Whiskey River BBQ burger was good, but it was more well done than medium well, as I had ordered. I've also noticed that RR is stingy with their fries. The metal cup they bring them in was about half full for both of our orders. Maybe they save money this way because who wants to look like a pig and order more fries?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lansing
Richard S.,"Newport, MI",0,4,,2.0,10/30/2016,"Ordered the French onion soup to start. Why can't Red Robin, wherever you go, serve a HOT bowl of soup!?

J C.,"Lansing, MI",5,58,10,3.0,12/22/2014,"Oh red robin.  Your burgers and strawberry lemonade are awesome but the place is a little crazy as some others have pointed out. You go in, and it's always got a crowd, so that's good and bad. Expect a lot of noise and perpetuating chaos while you dine.  I will say though their food is consistent and sometimes all you want is a juicy burger and bottomless fries.  I would give it 4 stars based on that but took a star away Bc the service here is VERY hit or miss.  Good place to go with your family if you have kids. But probably not the best if you are looking for a place for deep convos.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lansing?start=20
Nick B.,"Lansing, MI",14,16,,2.0,7/27/2014,"Quick summary: Slightly above mediocre, overpriced, and over run by kids.  To start out, I'll admit I was dragged to Red Robin. I also had my concerns that we were the only table within sight that was under 65 or not accompanied by a minor. 3 birthday clap sessions broke out while we were eating.  The good: Smoke & Pepper burger was prepared to order and the upgrade to sweet potato fries was worth it. The burger was fresh and seasoned, even if a bit greasy. The server was competent, but she also had the vacant look one occasionally sees in the eyes of Chuck E Cheese employees.   The bad: 2 burgers, 1 beer, 1 softdrink and tip = $50.60. The Oberon tasted like the same barrel had been on the tap for a month. All together, not as bad as I feared, but I can think of many other places I'd prefer to spend my money.

Michelle L.,"Lansing, MI",1,21,,3.0,2/28/2015,"Bottomless sides!  I usually get the Red's Tavern Double with BBQ sauce and the crispy onion straws. affordably priced at $7. since sides are bottomless that is usually more that enough to fill me up. Main reason I didn't give it 4 stars  is that service seems to be better if you avoid mealtimes (roughly 6-8:30pm), our experiences have been rather dismal during those times. We're talking 30+ minute waits for food (even if we order when the server first comes), no drinks or lack of refills, appetizer arriving with/after the meal, can't find our server to pay the bill type stuff. So if you're looking for somewhere to eat between 9-11pm it's affordable and tasty. Nice place to catch up with friends since you have the option of endless sides.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lansing?start=20

The food the same, I've had a decent burger from this restaurant but that was about five years ago. The last copy of visits, the food was never cooked to my requested temperature and presentation was lackluster.

William M.,"Royal Oak, MI",29,93,,1.0,5/7/2012,"I tell Red Robin exactly what I want on my burger for my take-out orders.  They always add items I don't want.  Last time, they added ketchup which I cannot stand the taste of and could not scrape off the bun.  I contacted Red Robin and got a snotty e-mail from   stating they wanted me to waste more of my time calling them.  I'm not calling them over a simple issue.  So far, they are refusing to credit my credit card or offer me a refund.  $10 is a little too pricey for a burger anyway.

Oh, he came back once, to bring the order to go that I wanted at the END of the meal. I hadn't even started eating yet!! I asked him to bring me a fresh one when I paid and he said they would keep it warm then left without it. The order to go was over done, and the bun was not toasted as requested.

Lorraine H.,"Lansing, MI",17,161,16,4.0,6/23/2011,"Red Robin (Yummmmm!)  Okay, so it's a little hokey, but I dig it.  Solo diner (again), arrived during prime dining time (6ish PM), saw it was quite crowded but did not wait to be seated. Greeted pleasantly and taken to an elevated ""booth-for-two"" which was in a busy section near the kitchen. But it's okay, it gave me something to look at. I could see staff interacting with each other, communicating their needs and receiving assistance when asked. Service was prompt and accurate. I thought the burger could use a little salt, but since I am being treated for high blood pressure, I skipped the salt shaker. I like that they refill your fries if you ask, so I got a full order of  fries to take home with me.  Huge menu, big variety, great drinks. The restaurant was very busy so I think service was paying more attention to the needs of customers and not picking up - the floor needed attention, tho not a big deal. Food was coming out of the kitchen like gangbusters. Quite noisy there, in a good way - lots of child customers, which I usually enjoy.  Red Robin is a little expensive: $12.38 for a mushroom-swiss burger, fries and coke.  Worth it to me because I took half of it home. It will be my dinner again tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lansing?start=20

It was chosen for it's ""kid friendly"" atmosphere. I have to say it is very kid-friendly. The decor is hodgepodge, with some paintings having light up sections that seemed to keep our kids interested in staring at the walls and not flinging food. The menu includes several kid options, which was great, but our boys ended up wanting mostly the fries, and our friends' kids wanted to eat ketchup.  The food was good, a little salty, but what you would expect for the price you pay. And they were quick to bring out another order of mac & cheese when some of the kids needed a refill.

Catherine G.,"Lansing, MI",20,22,,4.0,9/23/2009,"A great variety of food, very quick service and talented wait staff.   What I like about Red Robin is not only are the burgers great and very customizeable, but they also have great chicken sandwiches, salads, soups and drinks.  I love their new Berry Limeade.  DELISH. The service is always very quick - I don't think we've ever waited for a table.  Food comes quickly too, and the waitstaff really knows how to time things.  They check back on you, but not so much that you're irritated. I do have to defend their fries.  They are large steak fries, and they're not for everyone, but if you sprinkle some of their seasoning salt on them and dip them in ranch, they are delightful.  Plus, I found out that you can order fries (at no cost) with any meal you have.  Even salad or soup.  They're like breadsticks there. I wouldn't recommend the place for a nice evening out, as they serve lots of groups and kids.  You are guaranteed to hear them sing Happy Birthday at least twice while you're there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lansing?start=20

YUM!  (comes with two dips).   I ordered the tasty banzai burger marinated in teriyaki & topped with pineapple, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, and mayo.  I ordered the burger without mayo because I was concerned about my heart.  Burgers come with a side of fries that are plain tasting.  I discovered after woofing down my burger that Red Robin has wheat buns, just not advertised on the menu.  I definitely would swap out the yellow white bun for whole wheat.
