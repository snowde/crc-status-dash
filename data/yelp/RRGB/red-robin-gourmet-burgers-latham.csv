David C.,"Castleton-on-Hudson, NY",26,1,,4.0,7/13/2017,I had a bacon cheeseburger it was pretty good. My waitress was nice to me and their honey mustard is good which is important to me.

Tracey K.,"Albany, NY",25,146,436,4.0,6/12/2017,"Never been here before. I didn't realize it was a sit down restaurant. I brought my nephew here for lunch on a Saturday. No wait and the place is big!  I loved the bottles  with lights on the ceiling. I want that! We got the guac and chips, no jalapeño. The menu said ""now with more guacamole."" Hmmm. It was a rather small portion but it was very tasty.  An over abundance of chips for that size guac. The kid ordered a double bacon cheeseburger which comes with never ending fries. I ordered the fish and chips which came with four good sized fried golden pieces of fish. It was really good! He also got a milkshake and I got an iced tea. A little over $40, kind of expensive for lunch but the restaurant was nice, service was friendly and quick and the food was decent!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-latham

We were celebrating my sister's 25th birthday. The Red Robin staff surprised her singing happy birthday with ice cream. All I n all great service and a good time had by everyone.

I thought that $ 7.59 was a bit much for a pint but oh well. My better half ordered a grilled cheese and I went with the French Dip. To be honest.none of the burgers appealed to me.

Bill Z.,"Hyde Park, NY",593,1477,270,2.0,12/5/2015,"Red Robin is in general my ""entry level"" for burger restaurants, particularly when my mom is with me. She prefers turkey burgers, which they do well. She also has some dietary restrictions, which they can accommodate. I'm not keen on their fries, but I'm glad they now let you substitute things like salad or broccoli or cole slaw. I also like their sweet potato fries better then their regular fries; I just wish you got more with your order. Mom's turkey burger was fine. My cheeseburger came out cooked to order, but the beef did not have a particularly strong flavor. The majority of the flavor was the smoky sauce on the bottom bun. It was good, but I'd rather have the taste of the burger. The little monitor machines they have at the tables here are a 2-edged sword. I do like being able to pay by credit card on them.  But what I don't like is that they make the wait staff less proactive, and that was certainly the case here. If you want refills on drinks or your unlimited sides, you have to use the device to request them. It's like the staff is trained not to offer them - they wait for you - and as a result they don't check on you quite as often, unless it's to see if you're done with your meal.  Our bill was also incorrect. I ordered a substitute side for my meal as well as an extra side, and I was charged for both. Our waiter did correct that when notified. Quite frankly, for the price I paid here, I'd rather spend slightly more money and get roughly the equivalent down the street at Burger 21.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-latham
Natascha B.,"Standish, MI",0,5,2,2.0,5/13/2017,Our waitress was very forgetful. We ordered multiple things and small things were forgotten. A side order and a drink.

Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, they call themselves. Red Robin is a poseur. There is absolutely nothing gourmet about Red Robin. Red Robin is an average chain, serving typical, mediocre chain fare.  If you like a good burger there are so many better choices than Red Robin. The focus at RR is on toppings. A good burger needs few toppings. But Red Robin is all about the toppings, to the neglect of the actual ""burger"". The beef patties on RR's ""Gourmet Burgers"" are a slap in the face to great burgers everywhere. The patties are dense, chewy, and flavorless. If you like to eat toppings, by all means, go to RR, order a burger and enjoy. And be glad that the burger is hidden under a mountain of veggies, condiments and cheese. But if you like hamburgers... you know, the things with tender, flavorful, ground beef patties in them?

Though the thick batter was crunchy, it had no taste or seasoning so bland. My burger was just average. I had the A1 burger. Her salad was not appealing to the eye at all, burnt garlic bread, etc. now... it was a Sunday, but that shouldn't matter. 1- we were sat immediately. After almost 20 min, a girl came by to see if we were greeted. No. We had no waters, etc. she went to the girl who was our waitress, and after another 20 min, she finally came by. We received our small app in like 20 minutes. So it's been an hour, and we basically just got water, coke, and fried zukini. We than waited almost 50 min for a salad and a medium burger. 2 hours+.

The food was good, I ordered The Big Ghost, the burger came pretty quick and it's presentation was nice. If I had to nitpick, the only thing I wish it had was a little more of the ghost pepper sauce and for it to have a little more fresh peppers on it. besides that the burger was overall very delicious and tasty. You can tell the food is freshly made and it is good quality. The prices on the food was pretty decent for a gourmet burger, not cheap, and not too expensive.

Just kinda melded together, with no ""wow, that's interesting"" flavor.  There was no char flavor to the burger either, which I like.  Unless you have a huge appetite and no concern about calories, endless fries are ridiculous.

Matt W.,"Niskayuna, NY",161,922,475,3.0,8/5/2014,"I'm stumped as to why this gets on ""best places to take kids"" lists, because it's basically a loud TGIF / Ruby Tuesday / Applebee's kind of joint, right down the the uncurated selection of random Americana on the walls. There's nothing particularly interesting for kids to do or see here (two for-pay coin op video games, big whoop), and the children's menu is decent but really standard in terms of selections. The burgers are good, as you might expect, but value for price I didn't find them that remarkable. The ballyhooed bottomless fries come with a catch: they give you very few at first, you then have to ask for a refill, and they get progressively harder to refill. So, meh, it's OK but for the price and trouble waiting (and great, great dificulty hearing -- IT IS VERY LOUD), a trip to Five Guys seems like a much better bargain.

Shawn F.,"Albany, NY",19,12,,2.0,11/3/2015,"Was asked how I wanted my burger cooked, I asked for medium rare. The server said it would be ""as pink as possible."" I assumed that would end up being medium well or medium, but it came out very well done. I didn't send it back, but if I end up here again and this happens, I will.  Asked for water that never came. The service is okay, but it is the tag-team type when someone different handles every step of the meal. In my experience, this results in sub par service, but I am guessing the method allows a restaurant to under staff the dining room and still get the food out.  There are tablet devices on every table. It is obnoxious. They also charge $2 for using it.

S B.,"Albany, NY",89,72,13,2.0,6/10/2015,"We had to try the burgers since RR claims to be gourmet. Gourmet they are not. Let's talk about the meat patties, the essence of a great burger.  First, the rarest they will cook a burger is Medium. But when you order Medium it's always served fully cooked with no pink but with grisly mystery bits of who knows what in the meat and the patties are super dry and tasteless.  The are not fresh tasting despite the fact that they claim their meat is never frozen. The meat is poor quality and it scares me that they refuse to serve their burgers with even a tinge of pink. These are over priced poor quality burgers. What's funny is that they offer a black and blue burger. Traditionally black and blue means meat flash sealed/blackened on the outside with and almost raw interior. Their interpretation of a black and blue is a well done burger seasoned with Cajun spices and topped with blue cheese.

Michelle B.,"Albany, NY",139,281,721,2.0,1/10/2011,"This is not somewhere I would choose to eat again and again.  But I am married, and marriage means compromise.  So, every few months or so I am dragged to Red Robin.  And I keep my mouth (mostly) shut, so that the next time we go out to eat, I can drag him somewhere I prefer (read: better).   Now, don't get me wrong, the food here often tastes decent.  How could it not with all that fat content?  I personally prefer to consume food that tastes good due to its quality ingredients, flavor combinations and preparation.  But maybe that's just me.   Red Robin is basically fast food served to you by a waitress, with additional options for your meal, plus beer and cocktails.  They have balloons for the kiddies and the occasional appearance of a person dressed in a creepy mascot-type robin outfit.  (Although I would argue it isn't a robin at all, because it's entire body is red rather than just its chest.  But I digress.)  Unlike many other reviewers here, I've found the staff to always be very friendly and moderately attentive.  Red Robin is of course known for their burgers.  Calling them 'gourmet' is a stretch, though.  While some of them are tasty, they are served to you half wrapped in a paper sleeve to prevent all the fatty contents from spilling out the back when you take a bite.  As a result, all the juicy fattiness accumulates in the sleeve and is soaked up by your bun, thereby saturating the last half or third of the burger by the time you get to it and rendering it inedible.  Blech!  Maybe this is a blessing in disguise, though, because the effect on my stomach from eating just half the burger is pretty unfortunate, so I can only imagine the consequences if I ate the whole thing.   I've tried the salads, which I found to be less disappointing than the burgers.  They are also loaded up with fattiness, so after learning to ask for dressing on the side, I've also become accustomed to eating around the huge globs of cheese.  Perhaps I should move to the wrap / chicken sandwich sections of the menu.  Something here has to be good...

However, the point goes to Red Robin for choices.  Many creative types of burgers.  I had the Royal, and it was very good.  Sooo many options!  They all sound so good. Ah, but the steak fries suck.  They can make it bottomless all they want, but it's pretty mediocre.  Compare that to Five Guys fries, it's not even close. Whoa, but wait!  Ice cream root beer floats are also bottomless!  Point goes to RR. Overall, not a bad place for a family outing.  Cute decor, a balloon for my daughter, and a larger menu makes for a good chain experience, and the burger is good enough compromise so that the rest of my family can have something else.  That's something Five Guys cannot provide.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-latham?start=60

(My stars are for the OR location.) Fact: RR's Latham menu lists 27 different burgers. Of these, Meg's ""natural burger"" is described as: ""For those who like their burgers in the buff, we offer this scantily clad substitute. Includes lettuce, tomatoes, pickles & onions on the side. Served with guest choice of melon or fries."" So, perhaps not a sybarite's obvious laser-beam pick? Fact: soft drinks are on the part of the menu called ""bottomless beverages"". Which to me suggests that if your glass is too small (though the one I had was the size of a small pitcher), you should ask for a refill when you're done, then repeat as indicated. BTW, diet choices include Diet® Coke™, iced tea, and Minute Maid Lite. Meg, it could be the waitress was messing with you. (Or maybe you just need a wider screen for your computer!)

Even people on Yelp have said positive things about the burgers here, some while disparaging the restaurant as a whole. I was suspicious.  Nay, highly suspicious.  But figured I shouldn't judge until I tried.  Well, I did try.  And the results were even worse than I expected.  At the very least, I thought it might be a big fat greasy gut bomb of way too much meat on a light and squishy buttery bun, a la Fuddruckers. How ground beef can be dry, flavorless and chewy, I don't even want to fathom.  There was nothing good about this burger.  Nothing good at all.  The best I can say is that the toppings were all fresh, and not wilted. No points for drowning crappy meat in high-fat toppings.  Regardless of how many, or how clever the combinations.  It is also generally a bad sign when the waitress asks how you want your burger cooked, and you learn the only choices are medium, medium-well and well done. If you are going to have a brown burger... go to Five Guys.  And never, never go to Red Robin again.  Unless of course, you just want to down yourself in beer and bottomless fries.

What I didn't understand was the price.  It came to $15 a head with tip...for a burger and fries?   The patty melt was largish, but come on...$15?  I was a little disappointed in that.   Service was good, and even though they were busy our waitress made several drink runs and was attentive. It was an ok experience I thought, but nothing to write home about.  Some day I am going to figure out why restaurantes insist on having a ton of junk on the walls and clapping waiters.  Ugh, I really think that is a major downer and so horribly pretencious and cheesy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-latham?start=80
christopher n.,"Schenectady, NY",46,48,7,3.0,8/4/2008,"Like other reviewers, I will be the first to admit that I've had better burgers in the region, but I can't say I've had a bad experience at Red Robin. I've been to RR about 5-6 times over a period of a year. I usually get the BBQ Bacon Burger and each time I love it, but I have gotten a few other things on the menu like an avacado burger which was pretty bland and tasteless. I suggest the tower of onion rings for an appetizer. Yeah the service isn't always super, but I've never had a truly bad experience there, and most of the time I go with friends or family who like to chat and don't need things super-fast.  As others have mentioned RR has a ""medium"" policy on burgers, but usually if you ask for ""some pink in the middle"" they'll basically cook it medium-rare which is how a burger SHOULD be cooked.  I am pretty sure RR recently raised their prices across the board, so it's not quite as cheap as it used to be which kind of makes it not so worth it, but if you're in the area and want a burger and fries this place is a decent stop.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-latham?start=80
Ryan W.,"Troy, NY",0,39,,2.0,4/19/2011,"Just a so-so place. A lot of my friends go nuts over this place and I have no idea why. The burgers are acceptable, but hardly what I'd call ""outrageously delicious"" as they claim. I think it's kind of funny how instead of ""how would you like that cooked"", they ask ""some or no pink"", since the rare to well scale is apparently too complicated. Honestly, I don't like their fries at all. They're dry, bland, and tasteless. Like chewing on sawdust. Their ""special seasoning"" (aka generic season-all) helps, a bit. Service tends to fit right in with everything else: mediocre. Servers do the bare minimum.  There's a good variety of burger choices. The couple I'd tried were good, but just nothing special. A decent burger with decent toppings. A place I wouldn't object to going with others, but not likely to have returned on my own.  Make sure you ask for ""no pink"", since a few hours after eating a ""some pink"" burger for dinner I was up all night vomiting profusely. So now I definitely don't feel the need to go back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-latham?start=80
Pat B.,"Lake George, NY",0,12,,5.0,11/27/2008,"Seems to be a lot of mixed reviews. I usually take a trip down with friends a few times a year.  Food has always been great for all of us, endless fries, towering onion rings, and great burgers.  Specialty shakes/smoothies are amazing too,  Price is great, never had any problems with wait, never had any problems with service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-latham?start=80
Gail S. J.,"East Nassau, NY",0,23,,3.0,2/24/2012,"Went there with the Grandkids for lunch during school break. Food is typical fast food, burgers are a little bigger but not any better then some other places! I do think it's a good place to go to with kids. Staff was very attentive, fast service, great with the kids, always checking back with us. Been there three times with others but it would not be our first choice if we were dining alone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-latham?start=80
Jessica L.,"Troy, NY",110,247,67,5.0,1/28/2010,"I have had quite a different experience at Red Robin than many other reviewers had. I have dined in and done take out several times, and my meals have always been quite good! One problem I do have though is often when we do take out, all of us want out own additional bin of bottomless fries, and often they just give us one to split amongst the many of us that order, they say it will be enough for us all - clearly they dont know the people I work with - they can eat!  Take-out is always ready when promised, which is great since we come from quite a distance to order here. I dined there twice within a month over the summer and had two different waiters and they were both great, one was annoying attentive and never shut up, but my meal was perfection.  My favorite order, getting a bowl of french onion, enjoying some mozzarella sticks, having a freckled lemonade, and the whiskey river bbq burger. I have had the whiskey river, the bacon burger and the 5 alarm chicken sandwich, and I will say they are all very good. If you are going here though, I wouldn't suggest the bacon burger, cause you can get that anyway, the claim to fame here is ""gourmet"" burgers, so try one of their more innovative recipes. Whiskey River burger is great because it has great bbq sauce and some crisp onion straws to go on it! The 5 alarm comes as a burger or chicken sandwich, I have only had the chicken. But if you like a kick, this is the way to go here. It isn't overwhelming, just gives you a little sweat, but you won't need a bucket of water to cool off your mouth! Freckled lemonade is a must try drink, lemonade with strawberries in it, and its bottomless! Lastly, always ask for a side of campfire sauce - usually it is offered with onion rings, but unless you ask for it, you will not receive - and trust me you want to receive this! Its a mix of mayo with bbq sauce, and its got just the right proportion of each! Have it with your onion rings, mozzies, or fries, and you will love it everytime!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-latham?start=80
Mike W.,"Hudson, NY",47,197,49,1.0,7/30/2008,"God, I felt bad for recommending this place. I even felt worse that we drove from Albany to Clifton Park to come here. The place was packed on a Sunday afternoon, which we probably should have expected and were fine with waiting fifteen minutes. I had heard that the burgers are excellent and that the amount of choices are incredible. Neither of these statements are completely true.  Upon finding out about the bottomless fries, we were elated at the fact that we'd be able to snack on something without actually purchasing an appetizer. I rarely complain about service in restaurants, but our waiter was pretty bad. He didn't remember our drink orders, took over ten minutes to get our drinks to us, another five to give us our first order of fries, and another ten to take our burger order. There were a few interesting, different burgers and I ended up with the Royal Red Robin Burger. You'd think that a burger topped with bacon, egg, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and mayo must be pretty amazing. I knew that there would be an issue when I learned that the burgers cannot be cooked any rarer than medium. The burger was extremely sloppy, no rhyme or reason for the way it was put together. As for the meat, it had to be cooked medium, so to me, it was a waste of nine bucks. Tasteless, floppy meat. With egg. Blah...  Just one bland basket of steak-fries (even after asking for another basket) and no drink re-fills later, we were definitely ready to leave. We waited a good twenty minutes for our check while the employee dressed in the robin costumer was about to visit our table twice. The final nail in the coffin? The waiter looked at the amount of cash enclosed with our bill and THEN asked if we needed change.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-latham?start=80

Patrick D.,"Albany, NY",8,11,,2.0,6/11/2007,"Red Robin makes good burgers, but everything else about this chain restaurant is thoroughly underwhelming.  Their unlimited steak fries are bland and only mildly improved with a liberal dose of Red Robin seasoning (salt, pepper and a little bit of cayenne pepper.)  Avoid the non-burger parts of the menu. The decor consists of the usual chain kitsch along with televisions every twenty feet so diners don't have to actually talk to each other.  The large open dining room gets loud easily and is overwhelming when the restaurant is full.  The waitstaff are good about refilling your drinks and fries but they have an overly fake cheerfulness that disturbs me. Overall, not my ideal restaurant but at least the burgers were good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-latham?start=80
Tim C.,"East Greenbush, NY",3,4,,1.0,11/5/2007,"Food is very good, prices are a bit high, service is horrendous.   Well if I were to rate this place on its food alone, I'd say Excellent--for a chain.  But I found the prices to be on the high side for this type of place, ex.: my wife's burger--a simple Swiss-topped blackened burger with nothing else on it--was ten bucks.  Bar drinks seemed high too.  But it was the service that puts this review in the crapper.   Now I know better than to expect much in the way of service when visiting these national pub chains, and my sympathies go out to the managers who have to find good help among the lot of 20 years-olds they are forced to pick from, but the service during this visit was absolutely pitiful.  In fact, I think I can say that it was, to my recollection, the worst service experience I've ever had at one of these joints--and I go to them often.  It's not that our waitress (we'll call her Jackie) was rude or mean, it's that she had no memory retention.  This made for reaaaally slow service and a wicked frustrating visit.  For example, it took probably 15 minutes just to get our drinks.  She even had the gall to come back to the table and take our food order before she had brought us the drink order.  And when the drinks finally arrived, two of them were not what was ordered.  To give you a sense of just how brutal this nearly 90-minute visit was, here's a list of all the things we had to ask Jackie for TWICE: silverware, lemons wedges (which were supposed to be in the drinks of our original drink order), a side of bbq sauce, a beer, and wet naps.  And then to top it all off, I had to practically shove the bill and my credit card under Jackie's nose in order for her to take it for processing.  It felt like we'd never get out of there.     I'm thinking Jackie should pursue a different profession and the managers at Red Robin should re-vamp their hiring and training practices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-latham?start=80
