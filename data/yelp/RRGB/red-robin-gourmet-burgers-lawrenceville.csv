Angel P.,"Norcross, GA",171,130,203,1.0,2/13/2016,"Negative 5 stars! We had a party of 5 on a Saturday night. Hostess told us that it would be an hour wait. Ok, we understand. Busy Saturday night. No biggie until every damn party that walked in after us got seated before us. Honestly, I don't think the hostess knew wtf she was doing. So we asked her a few times how much longer and she kept saying they had to get a bigger table..... BULLSHIT!!! From the waiting area, we could clearly see that there was a big table for 6 empty for about 30 minutes. Funny enough, that was the damn table they seated us at. Ok so maybe the hostess sucked ass but maybe the food and service would be better. Nope, not the case! We waited about 10 minutes until a server came and took our order. She disappeared after that. Never came back and checked on us or told us how much longer for the food. We waited forever! The table next to us, that sat down 20 minutes AFTER we did, got their food BEFORE we did. Seriously, WTF!!!!! One dish came out 30 minutes before the rest. (This is already 45 minutes in) Wow... Just wow. So finally the rest of the food came out. Fries were cold. Soup came out late as hell. By this time, it's already 10pm. I am so over it at this point... This location is such a poorly staffed/poorly managed establishment! We're never coming back to this dump! Tonight was just horrible! Save yourselves the money and time! This location is definitely not worth it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=80
Robin S.,"Lawrenceville, GA",321,17,8,1.0,5/21/2015,It's been 5 months and every time I drive pass this place I shake my head in shame it's my name Robin but I wouldn't feed a homeless person this crap on a bun and takes 40 minutes to get an alcoholic beverage,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=80

Chris U.,"Orlando, FL",2,10,2,1.0,5/21/2015,"The worst Red Robin I have ever been to. The waiters, and managers are completely rude. We had to wait a very long time for our server to even come to our table, and finally a manager came to take our order instead. She was so unfriendly and rude, we ended up leaving...even after we had waited 30 min. to get a table. I'd rather drive to another location.

Joe P.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,74,29,3.0,10/27/2013,"The burgers and fries are very good, but the service is so slow it ruins the outing. First we were told the wait was 15 minutes. 35 minutes later we were seated. Not good, but that happens. Understand we were a party of two. Then the fun part. Five minutes before a waiter came. We were smart enough to order food and drinks, but it did not matter. Forty minutes later, here comes the food. We both ordered unsweet tea. The refills were, you guessed it, sweet.  All told we were at our table for 1 hour, 15 minutes. This is not likely their business model for a party of two.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=80
Hannah M.,"Norcross, GA",0,12,9,1.0,7/30/2016,"Don't waste your time! This is by far the worst restaurant experience my family and I have had in a long time. First, the restaurant booths and tables are very dirty! There is ketchup smeared and splattered on the walls by the booths. Even our menus had sauces smashed on them. We should've trusted our first instincts and left. We were seated at 11:54 AM and placed our order immediately. When 12:30 came all other customers, including customers who came in after us, had been served and were eating. We decided to leave. At the front, as we were leaving, we asked the hostess to locate the manager for us so we could explain the situation, in an effort to call it to management's attention. He approached us with an ""uh huh"", not a hello, good afternoon or anything. Very unprofessional! As I explained to him why we were leaving he just stood there. We have eaten at Red Robin across the country and never had such poor service or seen a restaurant so poorly kept up. They receive one star for bringing out our drinks, that is not saying much for a sit down restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=80

Laura A.,"Atlanta, GA",157,8,2,2.0,3/9/2016,"My husband and I drive here regularly from south of Atlanta because I absolutely love their food. However, lately we've stopped coming altogether because the service is SO bad and our order ALWAYS comes out wrong (literally every single time). Every time I order some pink and every time they bring it out cooked with no pink and my side always comes out wrong. The service is SOOOOO slow it ruins everything for me! I worked at Red Robin for over 7 years and find it intolerable to endure such poor service. They're supposed to greet you in 30 seconds which I find laughable. Last time not a single person came to our table in 7 minutes then I had to get up and hunt someone down. I set a timer now because it happens so often and the servers AND MANAGERS basically roll their eyes like I'm lying about how long I've waited. First bite check back? Yeah right. Never happens. Napkins or silverware? Only if you ask and even then most of the time I have to get up and get my own . Drink refills? You might get ONE your entire visit if you're lucky enough to have your server come back by your table before your plate is empty and you're ready to leave. The management is so unconcerned with the sucky service and that bums me out so much. It is clear even THEY don't see the failing service all around them. When management can't even recognize a table is VISIBLY unhappy, there's a serious problem at the root of the restaurant. This really sucks because Red Robin is my favorite restaurant but between the horrendous service, unconcerned management, servers that just don't care and cooks that can't read a ticket, I'll spend my money elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=80
Apearl C.,"Atlanta, GA",254,611,186,2.0,6/16/2011,I've eaten at other Red Robins many times.  I ate here with a party of 6.  They sat us at a table surrounded by other larger parties.  There was literally 4 inches between our chairs and another tables chairs.  The employees continuously slid through those few inches.  Knocking my (and others in my party) purse off my chair and kicking / almost stepping on our gifts bags. The server we had was just ok. He let our drinks get empty before he offered (yes offered) to give us refills instead of just bringing refills! They MUST improve their service!  The food was ok.

Rodney C.,"Atlanta, GA",1066,37,157,1.0,1/13/2016,Last night I had friends in town.   We typically eat at great food quality restaurants.  A few weeks ago my partner and I brought his mother here.  We had great food and great service.   What a difference a week makes.   It's important to know who is running the show here when you decide to come in.   The food was still good however the restaurant was trashed and looked like a dump!  I thought I had walked into an episode of hoarders!  We were sat in an area where 10 tables were trashed and were never cleaned during mournfully visit.     The first time I got my military discount and this time the server couldn't figure out how to get that to me and stated well I guess you don't get it this time.   Then on our way out I noticed everyone on staff was more worried about cleaning and breaking down the bacon of the house versus keeping up the front of the house.   Just amazing.  So disappointed and not sure I could come back after this experience.   I need a clean environment when eating my dinner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=80

Ashley M.,"Twentynine Palms, CA",0,5,1,3.0,7/12/2014,It's way over crowded and took forever to get our food. I had to ask for every refill though my glass had been sitting empty for 15 min or more. Had to ask for silver wear and napkins even though I ordered a knife and fork burger. All the waitresses seem to have a bad attitude. And the poor bartender looks overwhelmed. Oh and my burger was way way way over cooked! ***About a week after I posted this the manager called and apologized for poor service and sent me a gift card inviting me back.

Gino M.,"Lawrenceville, GA",38,342,79,2.0,11/3/2012,"Our Red Robin experience has, unfortunately, been more miss than hit.  We keep coming back because we've got a toddler and we hope to have a sit down meal in a place that's appealing to both him and the parents as well as friends.  Unfortunately the food quality continues to disappoint. On our most recent experience the first bad mark was that the place was HOT.  It's the middle of an afternoon on a Sunday and the manager was refusing to turn on the AC (according to our waiter).  We complained.  She said there was nothing to be done.  We complained again.  She said the manager didn't care.  We said we were leaving.  The manager turned the AC on.  It shouldn't have to go that far.  Admittedly this was in a cool September - but on a day with the highs in the low 80's, a place should have the AC on in Georgia.  It's expected.  Don't be cheap just because it's a Sunday afternoon. Finally - the food comes out: the wrong fries, toppings on the burger were wrong, kid's corn dog was burnt to a crisp, our pretzel appetizer had about half the nuggets compared to the picture, drinks took until the meal was half eaten to deliver ... Unfortunately it was the final straw.  There are too many other options in the suburban chain hell that is Gwinnett to eat at a bad one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=80

This place seems to be severely lacking in server training. I understanding being busy, I served for 8 years. This was just unattentive laziness. Our drinks were never refilled, our servers switched without asking or explaining, the food was okay but took forever to get, we waved our server down multiple times and he just walked away. We eventually had to grab another server who made an honest effort to help us. We were there almost 2 hours! 50% of which was waiting on our food or a server. I'll never be back.

Local_Guy ..,"Dacula, GA",1,31,,4.0,11/17/2017,"Red Robin yummmmmmm!!! Try getting that tune out of your head. A burger joint at its core, Red Robins delivers the goods. I have only come to this location on weekdays during lunch, so I cant attest to wait times as there really hasn't been any when I come.  The decor is clean inside. Your greeted by the Lady Liberty holding up a burger instead of a torch. You would think with the name of the place they would have a cartoon bird holding up the burger, but hey, lets get some American spirit in here and display the statue of liberty advertising sodium and cholesterol. Some odd pictures on the walls that I am guessing were bought on eBay or an antique shop. Gotta dig the beer bottle chandelier in the bar area though. Burgers are really good. Its not the meat so to speak, but the seasoning they use ( you can buy this stuff by the way ). The prices are kind of all over the place, but if you order the Tavern Burgers, its $6.99 for a really good burger and unlimited fries ( fries are good as well ). They do have some unusual burgers such as a Taco Burger...guess the chef was high one day and wanted a burger and Mexican, but had to use what he had in the immediate area so threw chips and guacamole on a burger.  The place is frequented by elderly people whenever my wife and I come. I guess the early bird special here rocks. Staff seems friendly and you get your food quickly ( again this is when I come ). It gets the bada-bing thumbs up from the Local Guy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville

Geoff H.,"Braselton, GA",0,2,,2.0,1/13/2018,Very disappointed. The hostess staff seem to think it appropriate to ignore the customers in favor of staring at the iPad used for seating charts. When they do finally decide to notice you they will walk away in the middle of your sentence to look for a table that apparently does show up on the all knowing iPad.  My burger was good and as expected on the other hand there were very few fries. My daughter had the pub mac and cheese. Size was not what was expected for the price.  My wife ordered the $7.00  chips and salsa. She referred to it as tomato juice and onions. Came in a very small contained more like a condiment size. The service was fair and we had no problem with the waiter.

Ashleigh W.,"Norcross, GA",115,120,538,3.0,9/19/2016,"I went to Red Robin with my mom two months ago and the experience was just okay. The food was great, but the atmosphere was more for families. My waitress barely came to the table to check on us. I was looking forward to the endless garlic fries but that definitely didn't happen.  Let me back track to the food. I ordered the Southern Charm burger with garlic fries and a virgin freckled lemonade. The burger was alright, but I really just ate the patty. The lemonade and fries were delicious.

Robin G.,"Lilburn, GA",15,73,535,3.0,5/6/2017,"This place has really gone down over the years.  When it first opened over 8 years ago it was a shining star in the community.  We could hardly believe our luck that it was only 10 minutes away.  Gourmet burgers with bottomless steak fries...awesome. Now with so many more options in the area, declining food quality and service, RR is not a first choice.   The ambience is still bright and cheery, very family friendly.  And the restaurant is full of fun eclectic art pieces.  They've changed the furniture (tables, booths, chairs) about a year ago including high back red leather chairs in the main dining area. The floor felt a little less greasy this time but the bathroom was still not up to par.  One of the faucets was continually running, paper on the floor, no toilet paper in one stall and one stall door literally bangs into the toilet when opened.  The food was pretty good, including the nachos with chili con queso.  The burgers, Royal/$11.09 and Gourmet Cheeseburger/$9.69, had great flavor.   The egg on the Royal was over easy and not medium as ordered and the bun fell apart;  but delicious all the same.  The fries were a little over cooked and the initial batch was lukewarm.  But the subsequent batches were piping hot.   The service was actually better than normal.  The waitress was pleasant and attentive and the food came out quicker than I can ever remember.   Possibly because we sat in the bar area.   There was an error on the bill but she had the manager fix it in about 5 minutes.  It was an ok visit but not somewhere I would recommend any longer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville

I asked why no steak fries and he said has been out for three days.

Didn't offer to discount, comp or anything to make our experience a little better. Never got any refills. I asked for a box for my burger I hardly even touched and never received said box.

Then we waited for nearly 15 minutes for our waitress to come to our table..mind you they were not busy. It took another 15 for out drinks to get there. Food came out after another long wait and we asked for sauces and our waitress said okay then proceeded to walk away and sit down to count her tips and talk with the hostess instead of getting the sauce. By the time she came back (with no sauce) we had to ask for more fries because ours had gotten cold...all around just bad customer service.

Requested a dessert, ""Gooey Chocolate Brownie cake"", took really long to serve it.  It was delivered first to the incorrect table; then brought to our table.  Ice cream was melted and the person that brought it (not the server) gave us forks to eat it.

Candy C.,"Lawrenceville, GA",14,30,75,1.0,6/30/2017,"THE WORST burger restaurant ever, in fact it is one of the worst American style restaurant I had ever eaten at. I ordered 2 grilled Mexican style chicken with garlic herb fries and my family ordered hamburgers with regular fries. the chicken was so chewy and super salty like it had been in marinate for very long time and frozen years ago. I know this because the texture of the chicken had changed, it was super disgusting. the garlic herb fries were drenched in flood of oil and tasteless, same with the burgers. I also ordered smoothie, it was nasty like they just put the whole bag of sugar in it. I only drank couple sips. The service was super slow, it took forever for her to come by to ask for our drinks and to deliver our drink so forget about asking for more bottomless fries because you will be sitting there for 3 or 4 hours. whenever I heard their theme song Red Robin yum, it should be Red Robin YUCK!!. There are so many restaurants that did not survive the economy like Ruby Tuesday, Red lobster etc and this one will be on the same fate because they are not willing to improve but keep providing disgusting food and horrible customer service. It starts with management! if you are the owner of this restaurant, you need to fire the management and start new or you probably had already thinking about closing this business. Red Robin does not even deserve 1 star! I had to put one because I must submit this review. Customers need to stay away from this awful restaurant, believe me the reviews are correct.

Since my first review, the staff here is always been wonderful. I also learned they have a lot of different options for every situation that you need. I was doing a diet called Whole 30 once, I was able to get a burger with a lettuce bun with no dairy or gluten. I tried a vegetarian diet, and I was able to get a veggie burger. I was doing no diet and I was able to get an amazing burning love burger which is one of my favorites. I've also tried their milkshakes and some of their appetizers and they're all really good. With your burger, you're able to substitute bottomless fries for bottomless salad or broccoli too. Their broccoli is actually really amazing and healthy.

They now have tablets at the table so you can have the honor of inputting your rewards card yourself.  You can also pay $3.99 to play games on it or listen to your kids whine and beg about it. The fee is in small text so you can miss seeing that.  When you are ready to order, you push a button on the tablet. It's becoming just a more expensive Sonic except the customer service has been better at Sonic. Our server treated us as if she thought we were annoying. Maybe she was just having a bad day. I don't expect a faux Disney cheerfulness, but customers shouldn't be treated as an interruption to the job - The business exists because of the customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville
C S.,"Dacula, GA",1,105,,2.0,6/7/2010,"My husband and I have been going to Red Robin for over a year now.  The first few times were great, always enjoy the Gourmet burgers, bottomless fries and the specialty drinks served at Red Robin.   Our recent few visits at this location haven't been the greatest and definitely do not live up to the Red Robin experience.  The food is still good.  However it is the service that is lacking and has definitely gone down hill.  It seems the past few visits we have been to this location; we have noticed a different manager each time we visit, which speaks of possibly why the service is not at top as what it used to be like. Over the weekend, we had waited nearly 25 minutes to receive our order.  Nothing special about what we had ordered, but for a restaurant that had no more than 3 other tables full, service should had been more prompt. Our server appeared to be fairly new to the business, as a server with more experience would consistently check on there guests more frequent than what we had been waited on. We also encountered slick floors when we walked in, not because the floors were wet, but the floors had recently been waxed.  It was like we were on an ice rink, walking through Red Robin.  We mentioned this to the staff and they didn't think it was such a big deal, but if guests were to walk in and fall, that could lead to more serious problems. It's unfortunate that the service has gone down, much like what you would expect from McDonalds or Burger King, because Red Robin was one of our favorite places to go to for a great burger.  In these tough economical times, you would think a restaurants priority is to train there employees how to make guests feel welcome and receive top notch service. We definitely will not be going back. I'd much rather spend my hard earned money at a restaurant where service is great and I feel appreciated as a customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=120

I am Asian by the way. We ordered a gourmet burger and they substituted the bun without asking us and brought the burger out. When we asked about the bun, they told us it was over. I am surprised that the waitress did not feel the need to come and inform us about the bun and ask us whether we wanted to change the order or not before the order came. We did not want to change the order after the burger came and wait all the remaining of us had burgers. When we called the manager, he only offered to give us $1 off a $60 bill !

Add a basket of those tasty steak fries with seasoning salt and its set to be a night of tasty goodness.  I've only been to this location twice, however the service I received here was absolutely stellar, our waiter was attentive, maybe a little too attentive, but we never wanted for anything, even my weird special requests were handled with ease.

Granted the place was full but 15-20 minutes to get drinks was unacceptable. Also, the food was slow in coming out.  My hamburger had a sweet flavor I did not like which maybe was  due to their relish. Portions were scanty in terms of my daughter's chicken nuggets as well as their ""bottomless fries."" I had to order a refill of fries and when I saw the 4-5 fries on the basket I pointed out why so little to the waitress and she said the kitchen could only send out 3 ounces of fries at a time. Then the manager came by the table and he offered us (2) free dessert/appetizer coupons with the purchase of a dinner for next visit.  Uh no thanks, I don't think I will be coming back here.

David K.,"Atlanta, GA",196,116,95,4.0,11/23/2010,"Me and a group of buddies always come here after a game of disc golf at Alexander Park for some good burgers and bottomless fries!  Their burgers are always delicious and satisfying. The burgers are a bit pricey, but they will easily fill you up as they are huge! I've tried quite a few of their burgers and I have nothing bad to say about any of them. But most of them aren't something I'll rave about either. They are just good burgers that will satisfy anyone's hunger and taste buds. Their concepts aren't that of new and wild tastes, although they do have a variety of burgers, many of them don't have memorable tastes like that compared to.. let's say Vortex. However, again, they never fail at making a great burger no matter what the style and always leave me satisfied. Their fries aren't something to write home about, but add some Red Robin seasoning and ask for some honey mustard sauce and it will make your meal complete. Don't forget to get their strawberry lemonade as well! For some reason it goes great with burger and fries. It is a bit pricey though at $4, but if you don't care about the price--go for it, it may be well worth it to you. Their onion rings are pretty darn good! Good onion rings I feel like are hard to find. Even Vortex has pretty terrible onion rings. But here, the batter was nice and thick and crunchy! The onion actually stays in the batter when you take a bite! Love it! However, they were a bit too salty, but I was ecstatic just to see that they made the batter and fried it so well. Definitely would recommend it to anyone for an appetizer.  Service is /usually/ good. The waiters/waitresses have been kind and would happily take our requests for honey mustard, fries and drinks. Although there have been times it would take them a very long time just to refill drinks and it wouldn't even be busy, but that is rare in my experience. I think the prices should be a bit cheaper, but the portion size of the burger, and bottomless fries may make your visit worth it. I just wish I could get a burger, fries + a drink for $10-$12 (including tip).

Shawn M.,"Traverse City, MI",49,186,11,3.0,2/13/2008,"I'd have given Red Robin 4 stars, except my last visit there left a bad taste in my mouth. And it had nothing to do with the food.  I drive from Buckhead to Lawrenceville because I love Red Robin's selection of tasty burgers and delicious steak fries. I wasn't 100% in love with the service on my last trip though. We went on a Sunday, and we got there about 7pm, the restaurant didn't have too many patrons at the time, and we were seated immediately.  We sat for a while, about 10 minutes, before we were approached by our server (ED - tall-ish thin rob-thomas haircut blond kid), who said ""I'll be back in a few minutes"" and then about 5 minutes later came back to get our drink.  Noticing that this seemed to be how he rolled, and since we'd made up our mind on what we were having, we did our entire order at that time. We ordered drinks, onion rings for an app, and our entrees. Our drinks took a while, being as they were bar drinks, we didn't think much of it.  Other patrons came in, and were seated, our server took orders from a large table in his section. Patrons who came after us received their appetizers about 10 minutes after arriving, and they were having onion rings too. So we flagged down our server to ask WTF was going on... he scurried over to the computer work station, and put in our order at this point... came back and apologized that ""the onion rings weren't put on the order"".  OK, whatever. They were in now.  So we sat, and about 10 minutes later, we had some onion rings, which were delicious. When he brought the rings, he asked if we needed refills and napkins, we said yes to both, and he again disappeared. And stayed disappeared. He did manage to sing happy birthday to 3 other tables while he was ""getting our napkins and drinks"".  We continued to sit in wait of our dinners. It was now 8:15. I've never set in a restaurant for over an hour to wait on on entree when there was only two of us.  For reference, the last time we went to Red Robin, we had our entrees within 15 minutes, and the restaurant was absolutely wait-for-a-table packed.  We flagged down our absentee server again, and he again, scurried over to the computer, looked at it, looked at us, caught us looking at him, flagged down another employee, and then we were approached by a manager, who was very apologetic, and made sure we then had our food within 10 minutes of her putting in the order.  The food was delicious, and the manager came back to check on us. She went the extra mile to make sure that we left happy.

I like to get the patty wrapped in lettuce in lieu of a bun. The fries are all you can eat steak fries, but I can only take a few.  Too thick, often too soft. Red Robin is more expensive than Fuddruckers was (and there is no ""fixins"" bar). Most employees are teenagers - most seem uninterested in their job, although we've had a couple really good waiters.  I guess the service is best described as ""hit or miss"".

But I usually do the same thing I do with the BOCA meat, I load it with veggies & condiments. Not too bad. I like that you can make any burger, a veggie burger. Fish & Chips: The cod fish is bland. I added some lemon & salt to it. The atmosphere is always fun & loud. The employees have always been very kind to me & co. & the restaurant is clean. Now price is kinda steep when you think about it (especially if you add an appetizer or two or three or....). Combos range from $9-$16. Appetizers range from $3-$9.

And every now and then when I crave a burger, I crave a Red Robin burger, complete with steak fries and a freckled lemonade. We were seated at the small two-seat booths near the kitchen. I never liked these seats but they weren't the worst thing about our experience. We ordered a shake and a freckled lemonade. Our server brought the drinks out but the left us with no straws. It was a few minutes before we saw him to get the straws. We ordered two burgers, one with regular fries and the other with sweet potato fries. One of the burgers was also ordered without tomato. Our burgers came out and the fries were with the wrong burgers. And there was tomato in the burger too! Our server seemed to check on us every time he passed by our booth, which was a lot because we were right next to the kitchen entrance. Our server offered a refill on sweet potato fries. We accepted and he walked off away from the kitchen and to another table. I assumed he needed to check on things before putting in the refill request. I didn't see him pass by for at least five minutes. And when he passed by, he checked on us as if we didn't accept the refill. He offered to bring the bill, while I was still only half way through my burger. He brought it shortly after and said, ""No rush."" Still eating my burger, we ignored the bill and tried to enjoy what was left of our meal. A minute later, the server returns to ask if he can take the bill. We said no. He returns a minute later and asks again. We said no. He returns another minute later. At this point, I'm just finishing my burger and eating my fries. We said no again. A few minutes later, I'm done with my meal and am ready to pay the bill. I stand it upright (classic sign that the bill is ready). He passes by and picks it up. When the server comes back with the bill to be signed, he leans on our table as if he wants to chat but doesn't say anything. He stutters a bit and then leaves. I don't get it.

Joyce M.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,2,,1.0,3/6/2016,"Went to Red Robin on Saturday, March 5, 2016.  Asked to sit in the bar to avoid waiting; big mistake.  One waitress came to the table, introduced herself as our waitress.  Ordered root beer and water with lemon slices.  Got the root beer and water only.  Waited another 10 minutes before a different waitress came.  We did not realize that she was also the bartender.  Placed our order including lemon slices for the water.  Approximately 20 minutes later the food arrived and still no lemon slices.  The waitress/bartender was busy slinging drinks at the bar.  She threw a plastic container to her left; it ended up on the floor if the restaurant.  The problem, this item was being used to mix drinks (it appeared that it was a strawberry mixture that was included drinks for the customers.  The plastic container removed on the floor air at least 30 minutes with staff stepping over and around it.  Ordered the Avo-cobb-o salad.  The salad was good, appeared fresh and the Italian dressing on the side was tasty.  Within one hour of returning home, I was seriously ill!  Stomach cramps, sour taste and the dreadful case of diarrhea.  What a wonderful way to spend a Saturday.  BTW, we even had to wait for our bill.  Red Robin, the most disappointing experience in years.  I think I will skip visiting your restaurant until you take customer service seriously and improve on the customer experience.  This visit is a D minus!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=100

Jennifer H.,"Atlanta, GA",216,89,572,2.0,12/20/2012,"My friends and I went there one Thursday afternoon for lunch as it was not too far from our pool center after our workout. We were seated immediately as it was not too crowded then. Lucky us, I thought. Just wait for the real story to unfold in a minute. Our waiter went around our table of 4 and took our drink orders first. He came back shortly with our drinks but he did not put my hot beverage in a coffee mug. He said one of the other waiters had broken a tray of coffee mugs on Sunday. Excuse me, but it was 4 days ago. Shouldn't the mugs be replaced by now? So I get my hot beverage in a glass which I could not really hold on to drink or gulp. There was only one coffee mug in the entire restaurant which was given to my friend who had ordered hot tea. Then he went ahead and took our individual orders. We shared an appetizer together.  The appetizer of Towering Onion Rings came with tangy campfire sauce and ranch dressing for dipping. We were about to dig into the appetizer but we were missing our silverware. We waved down the waiter to bring us our silverware with napkins. The sweet yellow onion rings were crispy and right out of the fryer. Then comes our lunch entrees. We ordered a Caeser Salad with a bowl of Chicken Tortilla Soup. The salad was good and the chicken vegetable tortilla soup had Cheddar cheese topped with some sour cream and tortilla strips. My friend said it was alright. The other friend has The Royal Red Robin burger. It had bacon, American cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and mayo. Also no complain from my friend. Another ordered the Bleu Ribbon Burger which came with Bleu cheese crumbles, onion straws, lettuce and tomatoes. My friend seemed to enjoy her meal too. Then I had my Sauteed Mushroom Burger which had melted Swiss cheese and a spread of garlic Parmesan spread for that extra Yumm. I enjoyed my burger as well. All the burgers range around $10 or so. We were pleased with what the kitchen staff had made.  Then the waiter came back to check on us and it was like a nightmare on Elm Street that started happening. He started to refill some of the glasses with iced tea. Then he started to pour iced tea on MY head. I thought if I was growing a plant on my head then. For a few minutes, he did not realized what he had done. I started to stand up hoping he could see me and stop pouring tea on me. All my friends were taken back and I tried not to make a scene in the restaurant. I sat back down but the waiter did not apologize. He immediately got embarrassed when I nudged him to stop watering my head with tea. He left and went for some extra napkins to bring to me. Then he said it was his birthday that day and he later came back with a pitcher of water. He told me to pour it on him. What?? Bwahhh! I wasn't going to do that tit for tat thing since I am way beyond my elementary schooling years. He kept asking me to pour water back at him. Then he went back to the kitchen and I was wondering what he was going to bring out next. The manager came out and apologized on behalf of the waiter. Manager asked if there is anything he could do to fix the situation. Immediately my 3 friends said I shouldn't have to pay for a bad experience at RR. I was going to pay for my meal in any case but the manager saw how my friends reacted and took the meal off my tab. The manager thought it was just water that the waiter poured on me but I told him it was sweet iced tea. I am a sweet person and I do not need any sweet tea, not on my head. Do you dig this, Mr. Manager? No coffee mug, no silverware, no ketchup for my friend and please stop pouring iced tea on your customer.  That was not quite the lunch I had anticipated from RR, coming from the birthday waiter guy. It was early in the afternoon and certainly too early for happy hours to begin. I kept drying my hair so no lettuces or tomatoes will grow from the tea pouring experience. Damn, I had never given a 2 stars to any restaurant. This will go down in history as one of my weirdest dining experience. I'm not saying I won't come back, maybe next time with a better wait staff to sweep me off my feet so I can forget this one.

It only take 10 second to sing a birthday song. And mind you it was a Wednesday night I been there on Saturdays and they witness them sing the song to several parties. After I voiced my displeasure I was told they found try and get some people together.

Angela S.,"Smyrna, GA",362,568,2415,4.0,8/14/2012,"The very first time I ate at a Red Robin was in L.A. - just a few weeks before I moved to Georgia!  My friends told me they couldn't believe I had never been to a Red Robin before.  After that first time, I was immediately a fan. Since then, I've signed up for the free Red Royalty card, which is their version of a frequent buyer card.  All you have to do is ask your server for a card, and then you have to register it online.  They offer cool deals like ""Buy 9 Get the 10th Free - Mix and match Fresh & Fire-grilled Burgers, Entrées & Salads.""  However, my favorite annual perk is the free burger you get during the month of your birthday!  It's become a tradition to take at least one of my siblings with me each year when I go to get my birthday burger.  =) Most recently, my three siblings and I went to this Red Robin around 3 pm on a Friday for my free birthday burger.  It didn't take me very long to decide which burger I wanted: the A.1.® Peppercorn burger cooked to medium temperature.  I also requested ranch and BBQ sauce to dip my ""unlimited"" fries in. * A.1.® Peppercorn Burger ($10.39) - Per the menu description, this ""gourmet"" burger is topped with ""hardwood-smoked bacon, melted Pepper-Jack cheese, A.1.® Peppercorn Spread, crispy onion straws and fresh tomatoes on an onion bun.""  Doesn't it sound good?  Yuuuum...  The burger patty itself was probably cooked closer to medium-well than medium.  Although it's not even close to as good as my favorite burger in Atlanta (Bocado!), I enjoyed the mixture of the various flavors and liked the onion bun!  The steak fries, which are served with the burgers, are ""bottomless"" so you can eat to your heart's content.  They aren't the most amazing fries ever, but sprinkle some of their seasoned salt, dip into your favorite sauces, and enjoy with your burger! My brother was such a fan of the fries that he got two refills of them!  They also had no problem providing more fries to take home.  I know most people are probably thinking, ""Who takes fries home?!""  Yes, we do.  (*Hint: Toaster ovens are magical!) Overall, this Red Robin deserves 3.5 stars because their burger isn't the greatest, but I'm rounding up to 4 stars for their awesome Red Royalty card and friendly service.  Red Robin's ""gourmet"" burgers certainly aren't cheap but not expensive, and who else offers ""bottomless steak fries""?  I wish there was a Red Robin closer to my house but since this one (almost 20 minutes away) is the closest, it'll have to do.  I'll continue to return to this Red Robin for birthdays (mine and my siblings') and occasions when I feel like pigging out on steak fries with a good burger.

The food was decent but I used the tablet when I was ready to pay to call the server to pay cash and put the rest on my debit card so that I could tip. Needless to say, I got up and tried to pay someone else but everyone was too busy. It was busy but how can you not take a payment? I had just enough to pay the bill with no tip. After 30 minutes of the call attendant button blinking and turning red after awhile, I put $43 down on my $42.70 bill and walked out.

Blake B.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,1,,1.0,2/23/2015,"Visited Red Robin tonight 2/23 with my Mom. We were immediately disgusted when we walked in the door as the hostesses were eating at the front table (where customers could have been sat) with a less than appetizing view. Food was sprawled over the entire table and spilling onto the floor. We tried to overlook the initial disgusting state of the restaurant and followed the hostess to the back of the restaurant where she attempted to sit us at a table that obviously had not been looked under. The floor under the table was entirely soaked (like a drink or two were spilt and not cleaned up). There were also food droppings all under the table. We asked to be sat at 2 tables over (the only clean table we could spot). Keep in mind for later that this table was in direct view of the kitchen. Though we were taken back and surprised (because we have been customers of this restaurant since it opened) our server was VERY polite. She addressed us almost immediately after we sat down and seemed MUCH cleaner than the restaurant itself...she almost seemed out of place (sad).  After placing our order, we had some time to sit and talk. While waiting, we could see into the kitchen (like I said before). I took a double take when one of the food preparation employees turned around (WITH A FULL PLATE OF FOOD IN HER HANDS) and sneezed-seemingly onto the food in her hands. Whether or not she tried to miss the food I am unsure. I was in denial...there was no way she just sneezed on a plate of food coming out of the kitchen. As I continued to watch, the same employee continued to wipe her nose all over her shirt (like a child).  At this point we had enough. We asked to pay for our drinks and for our food order to be cancelled. We also asked to speak to the manager. She came over and let us know she would take care of our food order. No real apology was delivered from the front of the house manager. The kitchen manager then came out to apologize. We explained that the kitchen was not the only reason we were disgusted but it was definitely the final straw. She made us aware that she would address the issue with this specific employee. She also wanted to make sure this would not be our last visit (sadly it probably will be).  As we were walking out the front door (and past the kitchen) we heard a fake ""ahh-choo"" coming from the kitchen. As if we had not already had enough reason to leave.

Management needs to address this to the staff or hire better workers. Yes, you're friendly and smiling and letting us know to ask for whatever is needed, but please live up to it.

RR's prices have gone up quite a bit and today's experience definitely did not justify their new prices. RR is not what it used to be. Let me just say that I love RR and drove from Johns Creek and was really excited for a yummy lunch, but today's incident had me leaving unhappy and saying, "" RR, you've lost very loyal customers. Can't say we'll ever be back."" =/",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=140

Almost did not go because of many reviews talking about bad wait times for tables, food, and drink. Also negatives on the wait staff. But i went anyway, at about 6pm sat night. It was just starting to get pretty crowded. It only took 5 minutes for a table for 2. We were helped right away by a busy but friendly waitress. It took about 5 minutes for drinks and less than 15 mins for our food. I saw negative reviews on bottomless fries but we got plenty and waitress stopped to see  if we needed more several times. Service was great! My problem was that the burgers just werent that tasty, just kinda bland. I got the sur acha and the mac and cheese burgers, buns didnt seem very fresh and not the flavor i would have expected from menu description.  Overall, still a reasonable burger bar.

Brandy S.,"Watkinsville, GA",0,4,,1.0,9/17/2017,"Going here for the first time was like watching an episode of Bar Rescue. If you want first hand experience what a restaurant is like when it is being poorly managed and has staff that hate their job,then go here. You will often run into a restaurant that has poor waiters but this place took it to a whole other level. All the wait staff walking around like they don't know who has what table and groups of guests being left outside unattended. There is one bartender trying to make drinks for the entire restaurant, get togo orders ready and help give direction to the wait staff. She did an excellent job with what is being given to her. She often had to go get things from the kitchen and bring it to tables because the waitresses are nowhere to be found. The bad communication between all the staff is just a complete joke. The manager was also just walking around watching things but doing nothing. I would be incredibly concerned if I owed this restaurant. The food was just okay and might be better on a day that is very, very slow. We sat at the bar and she apologized a few times for the things we were witnessing. When we got up to leave, a different lady was behind the bar finally trying to help the bartender and I smiled at her and she just looked at me with a nasty look. I am glad we sat at the bar, otherwise I am sure we wouldn't have made it to get our food.

Took forever for someone to ask if we had given a drink order. I ordered the garden burger. What I got was a slimy half cooked something which was somewhat disgusting. The menu did not describe this as a vegetarian patty, which I think is what I got. I have had excellent veggie burgers and would have been ok with it but this did not even resemble that. The waitress asked what side we wanted. I asked what sides come with it.  She listed several choices but never said the sides were not included with the entree. No one offered to refill my water. That said, the patty melt was good as well as the kids chicken. Very expensive for what we had. That was my one and only visit to Red Robin.

Richard R.,"Suwanee, GA",2315,1000,11015,4.0,1/16/2014,"I had absolutely no intentions of writing a review for Red Robin, but my last visit makes me want to properly thank them. MY FIRST VISIT MANY YEARS AGO We used to come to this location weekly when it first opened, long before my unpaid career on yelp began (LOL)! I'll never forget the server recommending their Royal Red Robin burger. She said I needed to try it and listed all the ingredients. But the one ingredient that caught my attention was the fried egg on top. ""Say whaaa? A fried egg on a burger? I'll pass!"" I said. ""Try it. If you don't like it I will take it back and you can have whatever you want on the house."" She confidently proclaimed. Well, with odds like that who wouldn't accept the challenge. The moment came when the burger arrived and the manager delivers the burger herself. All eyes on me as I took my first bite with a twisted 'I don't want to eat this' look on my face (I can be very expressive). ""Well?"" She asked ""Gimme a minute, gimme a minute"" I said as I tried to savor the new flavor combo going on in my mouth. ""I hate to tell you this since you were so confident I would like it... but I don't!""  That look of defeat came over their faces and I couldn't tease them anymore... ""I LOVED it"" I joyfully exclaimed, causing her to do a pelvic thrust of victory! LOL Over the next 6 months we were loyal customers, but what started off as a beautiful relationship began to go sour. The food just started to taste different and not in a good way. We stopped coming and Red Robin fell off our radar.  MY MOST RECENT EXPERIENCE Fast forward about 6 years and we find ourselves in the area after a wrestling match @ Brookwood High School, so we decided to give them another try. It was a Saturday afternoon and the dining room was half full. The other half was full of tables that had yet to be cleaned and it stayed that way for the first half of our visit. The floors had visible debris and I was totally amazed at how the girl sweeping missed most of it as she swept. Seriously? You don't see that? I thought to myself.  Our silverware comes and it too was dirty with dried on gook and I was honestly ready to leave. But, we stayed since we weren't going to be using the silverware anyway. I just wasn't in the mood for a burger so I decided to order the Crispy Chicken sandwich. All the while I sat there I was annoyed with the conditions of the store, but slowly they started to get it together (I think they were in the middle of a shift change). By the time our food arrived most of the tables were clean, but the floor could still use some help.  FOOD/SERVICE I'm telling you, the crispy chicken sandwich was so good it completely turned my mood around. It hit the spot so perfectly I made a second trip for lunch two weeks later. The sandwich was just as amazing, but what I want to share is the story of service on that 2nd visit. I was greeted with a warm smile from the hostess as she opened the front doors for me. I was then directed to the bar for my take out order where a server and the bartender both took my order. While I was waiting, Don (the manager) greeted me and he, the bartender and I began chatting about food. I talked about how my go-to dish used to be their shrimp platter, which prompted him to ask if I'd ever tried the clams. I told him I love clams but they literally hurt my jaws to eat. He goes off to answer a phone call and the bartender and I continue our conversation. A few moments later he brings out an order of clams just for me. He insisted I try them and boy was I happy I did. They were DE-LI-CIOUS and very tender.  The waitress returns with my lunch and included a Coke in a to-go cup. She then cozies up with the rest of us as we talked. As I prepare to leave, she gives me a gentle rub across my back and warmly tells me to come back while the bartender and manager are Googling directions to a restaurant they recommend I try in Watkinsville. They were so unusually friendly I started to wonder if I was on some sort of hidden TV show. They practically walked me to my car and I gotta say I found myself thinking about how well they treated me for the rest of my day. THE VERDICT I have no idea what I did to deserve such kindness, but thank you! I am reinstating myself as a fan and placing Red Robin back in my rotation of favorite places to eat! Oh, and FYI - the restaurant was spotless on my 2nd most recent visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=20
Pen R.,"Loganville, GA",12,59,1,1.0,3/6/2016,"We have only eaten at Red Robin a handful of times but, each time is worse than the last. We only went this time because our daughter chose it for her birthday dinner. The food is not very good, it is VERY overpriced, and the service is way too slow! While our server was friendly, which is nice, it took way too long to get the items we requested and drinks were not being refilled the way they should have been. The kitchen staff looked they were more worried about goofing around than getting food out. And one of the staff at the line rubbed his fingers across his nose, looked at whatever was on said finger, wiped it on his pants and then proceeded to grab a fork, by the prongs, and set it on a plate to go out.

This place is confusing on the brain.  Is this a bar that looks like a kids restaurant or is this a kids restaurant that serves alcohol? They have a full bar with a pretty good selection of alcohol, including draft beer.  However, it does not have a bar feel.  It has a kids place feel especially with a giant cartoon mascot in the middle of the restaurant.    They have a kiosk at each table.  You can use it play games or pay your bill.  The cool thing is that is allows your bill to be easily divided between patrons.  This is a good idea if you are there with a large group of people and you don't want to deal with manually dividing up the bill or having your waitress / waiter do it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=20

We get seated at the front door at a booth made for preschoolers, request another table, get seated again at another table. Our waiter comes, basically pressures to order, order is placed, food arrives and here we go again.

Dan D.,"Brooks, GA",48,266,94,2.0,11/24/2015,"So this is the first time I have been to this red robin since I started doing Yelp Reviews.  For some reason, the older folks in my family love this place but every time they go, they complain A LOT.  So I usually skip the family outing.  I ask them why they continue to go back... Its like supporting a bad habit.  Anyway... They wanted to go tonight and I have been out of town a lot lately and haven't seen them too much so I decided to go with them.  We went as a party of 5.  I was pleasantly surprised at the remodel that was done at this location.  At first glance it looked clean, smelled fresh and new.  It is very dark though.  Actually hard to see your menus and food.  We asked them to turn up the lights but it was never done.  The new dining room is very crowded.  The chairs actually but up against chairs from other tables.  Once you are seated don't plan on getting up to go anywhere.  My grandmother went to the restroom and came out complaining.  She said they were out of toilet paper, the counters were sloppy with water and soap all over it.   Our server initially seemed attentive. She came to see us right away and took our drink orders. When she arrived back, 2 of the 5 drinks were wrong.  She had to pass the drinks around the table because she couldn't walk in between the tables due to a tight squeeze.  For appetizers, MIL ordered onion rings and I ordered French onion soup cooked well done.. cheese dark on top.  A few minutes later the onion rings showed up and they were perfect. No problems.  About 10 minutes later my soup rolled out.. it was not cooked well at all and the cheese on top was not cooked enough.  No spoon either ... hard to eat soup with a fork.  When she finally came back with a spoon our meal was coming out.  So my appetizer was the same time my meal. UGH Frustrating.  We had an assortment of burgers between 3 people. None of which had any complaints about the burgers and said they tasted good.   My grandfather ordered clam chowder as his meal... It did not come out with the rest of our meal.  It took an additional 10 minutes to get his Chowder and the reason was .. NO BOWLS !   There were only 3 tables occupied in the restaurant and no bowls.   The waitress said they had a busy lunch so they needed to wash bowls.  This is now 5:30 in the afternoon and they haven't done dishes since lunch.  Gramps did say that the chowder was good once he got it.  I ordered ""Clucks"" with broccoli. ( chicken fingers ) The chicken fingers were WAY over-cooked.  They were very crispy and seemed like there was more breading than chicken.  The broccoli was cooked well and tasted fine.  At this point I was so frustrated with everything else that was going on so I just kept the clucks and took them home to the dogs.  All in all .. it took us an hour and a half to eat at a Red Robin ???? Not a good experience.  Not once did a manager offer to make anything right.  I will remind my family once again why we should not visit this place again ....  Buyer beware .....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=20

Our burgers were up by time we finished the wings.  I had the fiery ghost burger minus the fresh jalapenos and my husband had the burger with shredded pork.  My burger was seasoned well and tasted great.  The spice wasn't too overpowering.  He says he enjoyed his burger as well and you can't go wrong with the bottomless fries.

The problem tonight was the service, our waitress was wearing a cooks shirt and the wait staff all had sour looks on their faces so I am guessing they were understaffed.

M'Kaneghay H.,"Snellville, GA",85,55,3,4.0,1/18/2015,"I like a restaurant that I can visit with my kids as much as one that I can visit without them. And this one falls under the with the kids category. Our family has made many trips on Friday nights to Red Robin without many issues. And in the instance of an issue, it is resolved before we get up from the table without us having to ask for the manager. The food is good for burgers and fries and I like the variety on the menu (not too much but not just a few). The service is what makes them a little better to me. My young kids are always entertained not only by our server but by passing servers. If you are in the mood for a burger and fries (or their onion tower) make a stop and you should not be disappointed. Also, you can hang out in the bar area if you don't want to be bothered with kids through the restaurant. The bar area is for adults only.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=60
Nicky W.,"Atlanta, GA",23,50,20,5.0,1/3/2015,"...the customer service at this spot is TOP NOTCH! This is my second time frequenting this spot. I didn't realize that I had a $20 royalty discount that had expired back in December. Sean, the manager for the night, honored my unknowningness! This was far and beyond what I had expected and says a lot about their customer service. I'm eyeing a letter of gratitude to their corporate office and complimenting Sean & our waitress, Christy. The visit was totally worthwhile because of them. I ate the Whiskey Bourbon BBQ burger and was full after the 1st half of my sandwich. Starting my 21 day fast tomorrow and couldn't think of another place to get my last bite of red meat. #bonappetite",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=60
Yoomee H.,"Duluth, GA",122,223,332,4.0,8/17/2012,"The first time I visited here was with my sister, Angela H. The second time, also with her as well and she told me to sign up for a royalty rewards card so that on my next visit I'll recieve a free meal on my birthday! So I asked my waiter if I could get one of those royalty rewards card and once I did, I saw a sticker which said I could get a free appetizer within 14 days after I signed up. So I saved it and tried to use it the year after (this year), but they changed their promo and told me that the offer is now invalid. I was disappointed but I know it wasn't the waiter's fault that their policy changed. So here I was with my 3 siblings, we were seated right away in a booth. My sister, Angela H. used her birthday meal coupon and got her free meal and her diet coke.  **Bleu Ribbon burger - $9.99 Basted with a tangy steak sauce and topped with crumbled Bleu cheese.  Served with crispy onion straws, lettuce, fresh tomatoes and zesty chipotle mayo on an onion bun.** I had ordered the Bleu Ribbon burger which had bleu cheese crumbles on top of the beef. I don't remember the french fries being so flat and wide.. hmmm... maybe it's just me.. but I thought the fries were a lot thinner. Anyways, I'm not too big on fries, so I let my siblings chow on those. I had a few but wasn't crazy about the fries. I wasn't too big on the bleu cheese either, but my little brother was and so I ordered it just so that I could half it with him. I don't eat much. Surprisingly, the Bleu Ribbon burger was tasty.. and I think I'd get it, again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=60
Gina N.,"Suwanee, GA",38,96,46,1.0,7/14/2014,I was craving burgers and their freckled lemonade....but I'm so sorry to say I will NOT BE COMING BACK. The service was the worst I have ever had in my life. Our server Yasmine forgot what I told her 1 min ago after I  repeated it like 10 times and still didn't get it right wasn't attentive to any of her tables and had other servers do her job for her. Food was okay but the service just ruined it for me!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=60
Dee A.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,6,,2.0,6/17/2015,"We visited this location on Saturday, June 13th at about 4:30. Surprisingly, the waiting area was full, yet there were several tables open but in need of cleaning. They were either short of staff, or they were moving at a snail's pace. We opted to sit in the bar area rather than to wait to sit in the dining area. We entered the area to find that it was not clean. There were dishes and food on and behind the bar. In fact, we had to wait for someone to come wipe out our seats before we could sit down. Once we sat, I discovered that the floor was sticky. All of this distracted from the experience. I'm not sure exactly how long it took for us to receive the food, but it was not worth the wait. For the price, we were definitely expecting better. Due to the wait, we didn't even bother to order more fries. The aspect of the visit that bothered me the most was how the bartenders ""cleaned"" the blender pitchers. Apparently, after a blender is used, its pitcher is placed in the sink under running water, which is allowed to run continuously. After another pitcher is used and in need of ""cleaning,"" the ""clean"" pitcher in the sink is dumped of its water and replaced with the dirty pitcher, water still running continuously. We sat at the bar for at least an hour and 15 minutes and never once was the water turned off. Due to their wastefulness, uncleanness & mediocre food, I will not be visiting this location again any time soon. I really don't understand why it is so popular.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=60
Candace D.,"Snellville, GA",61,25,3,5.0,1/2/2016,"Great food, always worth the trip. Service could step it up a little bit in the sense of disappearing servers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=60
Paige S.,"Snellville, GA",0,2,,4.0,7/26/2016,"I am a fan because of the selection that you get in burgers and alcoholic beverages. The menu give a lot of burgers to chose from and my hubby and I enjoy the atmosphere, not to mention the bottomless fries. My burger I prefer to be medium well and I have been to this location five times and the temp of the burgers has always been spot on. My hubby likes his well done and he says the burger is well done without being dry, so he is a fan as well. Also, the drinks are nice and you have a great variety to choose from.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=60
Paige S.,"Olympia, WA",22,318,506,5.0,12/1/2014,We were a bit put off by the reviews but decided to give Red Robin a try and we sure are glad we did! Our waiter Robert (Bob) was awesome and super helpful. My husband asked for a few recommendations and he told us his personal favorites and popular items and told us about a seasonal shake. My husband got the Chili Cheese burger and I got a bowl of Red's Chili Chili and we both were super satisfied! My husband said his burger was seasoned and cooked perfectly and the chili and cheese was an awesome topper. My bowl of chili came with a great little focaccia bread to dip that was really tasty and the chili was awesome! I hardly order a bowl of chili out and I'm glad I did it here. Our waiter hooked us up with a Red Robin card and we will definitely be back to try more!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=60
