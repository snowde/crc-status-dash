Travis C.,"Lihue, HI",166,115,69,5.0,11/11/2015,"This has always been my favorite Red Robin! Great food and great service! We decided to go on a Friday night and it was packed. My first thought was that our food was going to take a while, but I was wrong. Our food came out at a reasonable time and our waitress was a nice young lady who was always making sure our drinks were full and we were doing ok. I love it when a waiter/waitress knows how to do their job well, that really reflects on the dedication of the restaurant.  I love the burgers here. They always taste amazing and live up to being ""gourmet"" burgers. Slightly pricy but for what you get (including bottomless fries) I believe it's worth it.  Go here.. It'll be worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-layton?start=20
Jose F.,"Farmington, UT",129,4,,5.0,12/19/2016,"This is truly my favorite restaurant ever. I always ask for Jolene, she's the best! Makes the whole experience even better. The fries sprinkled with their seasoning and with a side of fry sauce is definitely my favorite and the main reason why I go there. I usually get the crispy chicken tender salad which is delicious but I always make sure someone in my party gets a burger in order to get bottomless fries or they'll charge you every time you get fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-layton?start=20

Mushroom burger and onions rings were very yummy!!  Their new BBQ salad was not a hit. First, put the darn thing in bowl, it's hard to eat it. If it's a bbq salad, don't be shy with it, put more bbq sauce instead of a little drizzle. It's was to much work to eat it.

Dan F.,"Centerville, UT",117,28,52,5.0,6/14/2015,Sat in the sports bar area for a change. Jen was who waited on me and she is absolutely awesome! I got a Blue Moon and Southern Charm Burger. She brought me a water without asking which is huge bonus points. Many places just bring you the beer and count on you buying more and more unless you ask for the water. She told me in advance that the sweet potato fries take a while and if I wanted more it would be good to get the refill in advance. I had left overs and she even advised how they taste better reheated in the oven. She was super chill to talk to and was extremely nice.

Brian S.,"San Jose, CA",27,36,3,3.0,1/1/2015,"Home of the soggy fries. They have a good fry sauce, almost a hint of bbq and good seasoning salt. Ask for the fries well done if you don't like steamed potatoes called french frys. The sweet potato fries are shoestring so no problem there.  The bacon on the burger taste the same as McDonald's,  if you like that great, I took a bite and spit it back out on my plate. Didn't look to cool but I just was not ready for fast food taste at a sit down burger joint.  Root beer floats for the kids are bottomless and tasty. Ice tea was OK and refills came in a timely manner. Ranch dip was great. The saving grace for messing the bacon up and going with paper thin fast food leftovers was, they have a tier 2 menu, $15 burgers but hey they found some pepper bacon that resembled real food. I will go to the next level next time and order an elite burger, that really looked good. 3 stars is accurate for Red Robin, fun decor, noisy, bottomless drinks and fries, nice staff, soggy fries and paper thin bacon for third world countries bad restaurants.  Can't mess up the bacon in this country.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-layton?start=20
Walter C.,"Layton, UT",11,194,21,4.0,11/16/2014,"Red Robin has stepped up their game.  Doh Rings?  Call them what they are, Cronuts!!!  Love them, I don't care what you call them.  Good thing I got the eight pack, barely got to eat those since they get eaten quickly.  Did like the Big Sky burger.  My only concern is that the Sriracha sauce needs to be spread a little more evenly on the burger, it is a bit of a surprise when you bite into the one spot that most of the sauce is.  Garlic Herbed Fries, need to step up the level of garlic on the fries.  Good, but it could be better.  Drop by Wingers and try theirs that will give you an idea how it should taste.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-layton?start=20
Klaudia S.,"Canyon Country, CA",1,5,,1.0,4/18/2016,"Terrible service at this Red Robin. They are excited about their remodel and so were we. After being sat in the bar area, we waited more than five minutes and no service from anyone. The waitress had three tables to cover. A new person was seated right next to us and she came over to get his order without even acknowledging we were there. After that nonsense, we walked out to tell the hostess and before I could get a word out she walked away. So, we decided to leave. On the way out the manager was telling people to have a good night, so I looked him in the eyes and told him we had horrible service. What did he do? Absolutely nothing and walked away. Never eating here again. May even cut Red Robin off the list permanently. Be warned!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-layton?start=20
Trevor F.,"Logan, UT",40,46,16,5.0,10/2/2017,"How can one not love Red Robin? An all-time favorite and for multiple reasons. 1) Bottomless steak fries. Enough said. These fries are some of the best in the country. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Paired with ranch and ""campfire sauce"" (fry sauce with some seasonings) they are fantastic! We usually ask for them to bring some out while waiting for our food. Never disappoints.  2) Delicious burgers! That's their main focus, so if you don't want burgers, don't come here. Every burger I've had has been good and fresh! I'll admit, I wish they had some more special creations, or maybe a make-your-own burger but I'm satisfied with what they have to offer.  3) Service is super friendly! They are kind and helpful when answering questions.  If you are arriving between 7-9 you're probably going to have to wait to get in, but if you get there before 6:30 you should quickly get in.  Overall, one of my favorite restaurants! Give them a try!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-layton
Travis B.,"Ogden, UT",101,393,202,3.0,1/2/2018,"Red Robin just isn't in my rotation of chain restaurants.  We go 3-4 times a year but it just doesn't make the ""favorites"" list and I think I finally figured out why. The burgers are good. Not great, but a solid good.  They shake up the toppings, the buns, the flavors, but at the end of the day it is just a burger.  Nothing really special about it but somewhere between ""meh"" and The Big Kahuna Burger on Pulp Fiction. The fries are good. Steak fries always win in my book.  RR sells them as bottomless so they are pretty mass cooked and never hit the table hot and awesome.  It's not like I just solved a calculus problem here but I think that is why they aren't the awesomest of awesome.  Luke warm fries. The chicken sandwiches seem to be less than good.  Not bad, but forgettable.  They remind me of an after thought like ""hey, we put 2,000 burger combinations on the menu but now realize not everyone eats red meat.""  A little focus, attention, and love of poultry could make a good chicken sandwich. Would love to see this place make burgers a ""WOW"" experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-layton
Tena C.,"Syracuse, UT",45,268,820,3.0,6/6/2017,"Red Robin has sandwiches, burgers and bottomless fries.  I've tried their soups as well.  Overall, this location does good business, but my husband doesn't really care for their food.  I can usually find something that I like, but he struggles to find a good burger.  As a result, we don't eat here very often.  When I come, I try to select a variety off the menu so I don't get stuck in a rut.

Zaven A.,"Layton, UT",142,132,271,3.0,8/12/2017,"Average. Not as good as I remember in the past. I had the Bleu Ribbon Burger and my wife had the Prime Chophouse. Both were good, but not great. Love the bottomless fries, especially with their signature Campfire sauce. Too bad the burger fills you up so much already! We tried the fried pickle nickels appetizer, and for $5 I feel like it's a pretty good deal. There's not a bunch of them, but they are delicious (especially dipped in Campfire sauce.... Hmmm maybe I need to get some of that to bring home!) All in all a decent experience. Good service, food that is great sometimes and meh other times...

I must say that today's visit was specifically so we could redeem our birthday burger (my niece gets one every year) and didn't find out til the end that they do not honor the Birthday burger rewards. Had I known, we might not have come here at all. Although our waitress was great, I felt that the salad included frozen chicken breast that was reheated, which sucked because I was really hoping for fresh chicken. It killed the salad for me.

Eventually a server came over that said I will take care of you. Our server was Chad and he was amazing throughout the entire lunch! One of the burgers that was ordered had pulled pork on top and came out without pulled pork. Hence the name of the burger boss hog.

Cyd O.,"Layton, UT",1,39,16,2.0,1/9/2017,"I ordered the Grilled 4-cheese Sandwich (I'd never ordered Grilled cheese at a restaurant before), and it was surprisingly good. In fact, it was yummy! The SERVICE, however, was bad, as usual. At about 1:30 pm, it wasn't crowded, but we say in the bar (away from the loudest music), with one other table of two. Our server stood over by the bar, chatting with about 5 girls (also servers).  By the time he greeted us we had decided on our beverages, debated appetizers for several minutes, and I had decided what I wanted three separate times.  Our food didn't take too long, but he hadn't brought everything, and our fries were cold and kind of floppy. He popped by long enough to ask for fry sauce, then went back to flirting, and left the dining room.  He didn't show his face again until it was obvious we were really finished. And even then he didn't offer refills, but promised to be right back with our ticket.  No drink refills, no bottomless fries, and no tip. Now no tip is significant, as my husband and I are *good* tippers. Having been a server in my younger days, I'm adamant about that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-layton

PUT IT BACK ON YOYR MENU, RR!  :) I like the new remodel, especially the sign in front that explains how RR got its start in 1969.  Had no idea this chain was that old.  This Layton location never disappoints, evidenced by its packed parking lot every day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-layton

However it's been about two weeks and I am still HAUNTED! by awful experience at this restaurant.  From the time the host walked us to our seats to the time I hobbled back out to my car in my walker. (almost 2 hours later) I was completely horrified.  The restaurant was filthy, disgusting, dirty.  It felt like walking the green mile back to our booth, that was covered!! forign white gooey stains. Fry's caked into the carpet all the way back into the kitchen like Hanzel and Gretel had come through smashing food into the carpet and seats as to not get lost  on their way back to the kitchen.  We ordered drinks that were broght out to us in the bottle proudly displaying that they had expired 3 months previous. And then we waited... And waited.. I saw my dates facial hair begin to grow...my skin started to wrinkle and age, as we  waited an HOUR AND A HALF! before we finally received our cold soggy food. And during that long wait at some point in time youll need to use the restroom.  And perhaps it's because they serve expired beverages and possibly food  that has been sitting out for god knows how long... But two out of the three bathroom that were there were so horrifically clogged I thought I had walked into a crime scene. I thought I should go call for help. Maybe they didn't know disgusting it was?  Giving them the benefit out the doubt. (it was busy) when I noticed that the other person in the bathroom with me was the host! And other employees! I dont think I've ever ate at such a disgusting place. And I don't think I've ever met employees with such a careless disregard for their jobs.

Our waitress apologized & quickly remedied the problem.  No harm done... until we got the check.  That's when I realized that they had forgotten to bring out appetizers that we had ordered.  They didn't forget to charge us, though.  I pointed this out to our waitress, who was mortified that she was going to have to tell her manager that our order had been messed up a third time.  We fixed the problem by getting it to go & she brought it out in a hurry.   In the end, everything came out fast and good.  I'd be more upset except that even with having to have our meals redone, they still came out fast.  I'll pretend that I caught them on two bad nights in a row.  I'll still go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-layton?start=40

Any burgers you order comes with bottomless fries, and the fries are very delicious.  If not for health reason, most could probably sit down and eat a few baskets of the fries.  They go very well with their special seasonings too.  Items mentioning are the Burnin' Love Burger, Chili Chili Cheeseburger, and the All-American Patty Melt.  The Burnin' Love Burger with described to be a somewhat spicy burger with jalapeño, but it tasted pretty sweet and dried, so do not expect any ""burning"" sensation from it.  The Chili Chili Burger had excessively amount of onions in it, which completely overpowered the chilli and cheese flavour.  The Patty Melt was ok, but slightly over greasy.  I also had the mint shake one time.  It tasted very good and fresh.

One waiter was even scratching his hairy psoriasis arms and dug his hand into the container with the limes and placed it in the drink. Also another one would pour the chocolate shavings into her hand and eat a few then dump the rest on top on the milkshake. Another waitress was taking out a spoon that was in a milkshake and licked it.  WHO DOES THAT? Completely unprofessional. They also place drink trays leaning against the front of the area where the bar tender is, and they fell multiple times onto the dirty ground and would just pick them up and put them right back. Completely disgusted! I couldn't even finish my burger. They serve drinks on those contaminated trays to customers, the customers pick up whatever bacteria was on the floor by handling the cup their drink is in and then touch their burger.
