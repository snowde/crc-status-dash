Timeka P.,"Kansas City, MO",51,23,15,4.0,1/9/2018,"Who doesn't want bottomless fries?!?! I came here with my family to have a dinner out. It was really good. Of course we couldn't get enough of the fries. Our server on this particular day was not the best, but I won't let that affect this review because overall service was great. One thing that i did absolutely love about their service is they clearly worked as a team. When our fries ran out, other servers even the manager would jump in and  re load us. Another server even brought our food out. Now to the food. The kids ""pizza"" was a cut up bun with sauce and cheese. Total waste of money. Stick with burger or chicken fingers. My husbands burger was pretty tasty as well but the  bacon was paper thin. Almost like the pre cooked stuff you get at the store. I had the Siracha burger with and upgraded to garlic fries. It was so good! I paid a $1 upgrade for the fries and the portion was extremely small. I'm assuming this is because of bottomless fries. Lastly, we spent $60 for 2 adults and 3 kids. This is pricy for a burger joint! We will return but only for special occasions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty
Linda P.,"Kansas City, MO",136,287,1189,4.0,3/23/2017,"We came in for a late lunch and the server was the best.  He knew what we meant even when we forgot what to call the sauce/ dip we were looking for.  I know it's not good for my figure but the endless side is killer.  The seasoned neverending fries with garlic aioli (have to request) and a lot of the other dips (fire sauce -another winner, honey mustard, ranch) They had a new menu of gourmet burgers so we ventured out and got the burger on cibbatta bread which was delicious.  My only complaint is I personally rather eat the fried potato patty aka hash brown on the side rather than in the burger. Mmm I have to remember to come back to red robin more. Croissant sandwiches are yummy also if you've never had one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty

No less than 7 tables surrounded us, covered in half eaten food and used plates. Our server - whose name escapes me - was too concerned with chatting up her friends to actually manage her tables. Again I emphasize, what do we expect - but why do ""fast casual"" restaurants such as this bother to ask how you'd like your burger cooked?!

Mike W.,"Kansas City, MO",161,176,328,3.0,4/5/2015,"Easter Sunday, not the typical brunch stop, by late planning and no reserves brought us to the no wait, bottomless fries, Red Robin...we've had good luck here in the past...so what the yeck, gotta eat... Rolled in, party of 5...no wait, had two baskets of fries on the table in five minutes.  Good start...ordered an, avo-cobb-o salad, no cheese, wife did the simple grilled chicken salad, sons did buffalo tenders and fries, and burger w/ fried egg...not sure what it is about my kids, but they love burgers with eggs on top...grandma, did the turkey burger...then the waiting began, and we waited, and we waited...40+ minutes later a tray of food is moved our way and the unloading begins... Everyone has their meal and eating, when I notice the avo-Cobb-o salad is missing what...the avocado...you would think that would've been the one item they wouldn't miss...wrong...and they forgot to add the garlic bread...after another few minutes, waived the girl down and was awarded 4 small slivers of avocado...ok...meals are rolling now, ready for a refill on the sweet potato fries, BAM, hit with the response...were out of them...strike two, but that's where it ends... I do find it amazing that once the food is dropped in several of the chain restaurants, the servers slowly begin forgetting you until the bill...that's good, let you eat, but a quick check to make sure everything is good, is always nice...

Rachel P.,"Kansas City, MO",11,188,23,2.0,6/15/2015,"We've been twice in the last month - one for to go, on account of the REALLY long lines and impatient kiddos; once to dine in.   Both times were underwhelming.   As I waited for my to go order, the bartender offered me a drink while I was waiting - and then charged me for it after I'd already accepted it.  (It was just lemonade - not trying to pull a fast one, but that seemed lame. If I'm paying $11 per burger, you could probably treat me to a drink that costs you less than a quarter in a bar area that was empty...)  Anyways, got home and my burger that was ordered medium well had dripped blood into the to go box. : ( The DH's burger was prepared as ordered. Nothing outstanding.  Our dine in experience was early on Sunday evening, with lots of open seats in the dining room. It took us a few minutes to get our order placed as one server seemed to be attending to almost a fourth of the tables.  We asked for a basket of fries to tide us over during the wait for our meals and after a gentle ask, we received them about 15 minutes later.  Still no food. Should have been a clue that one table had asked to get a new server and another table that was comped their entire meal because of slow times from the kitchen.   All in all, it took us over an hour to have dinner, which when fine dining would be acceptable.  When eating dinner with little kids, that's a recipe for disaster. Our server was friendly and professional, just seemed to be weighed down by inefficient kitchen staff. On a happy note, my bonzai burger was delicious and I learned that they serve sweet potato fries as an alternative to the regular steak fries for a little variety.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty
Kim D.,"Maysville, MO",0,7,,5.0,1/7/2017,"Very impressed with service and food quality!

Dawn T.,"Belton, MO",9,52,73,2.0,9/24/2016,"Seriously...step away from the salt... everything we had, except our drinks were salty.  We had the smores sweet potato appetizer and it was loaded with salt.  We had it at another RR 2 days ago and it had none. And the service was sub par, took forever to clear our drinks and plates etc.  When we complained about the salty food our waiter said ""Well at least you got to eat a meal"".  Wanted dessert but not trusting them to get that right, we will go elsewhere for dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty
Susan S.,"Kansas City, MO",18,57,20,4.0,5/29/2015,"Bottomless fries! Who knew...not the best bottom line for my bottom.    So -we waited a few minutes to be seated because the Red Robin was rockin'.  Our server Colton took our orders and brought some of those wicked fries and we settled in to wait for our burgers, because you can't go to Red Robin and get a salad you know. The problem was that, just when we were getting all rubber neckie because our order hadn't arrived and others' we knew were seated after us had...Colton came by and told us that he had forgotten to put our order into the system. He didn't throw anybody under the bus or anything, just told the truth. So we settled in to wait again and were rewarded in a few minutes with two of the best burgers we have had in a long time.    Mine was the tavern burger, a classic with a great fresh poppy seed bun. The Chess Player got some gourmet thing that was wonderful and neither of us thought we could eat them because Colton brought us those darn fries while we waited and they just jumped into our mouths. And, other than the forgotten order, our drinks were refilled and young Colton was attentive but not hovering.   But then...even though we hadn't asked because we know things happen in the restaurant biz and we were having a pretty good time, Colton took 50% off our bill.  Pretty righteous.    Needless to say, he got a good tip. I liked Red Robin and we will definitely go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty

Daniel H.,"San Jose, CA",507,1496,8565,4.0,4/27/2011,"I was craving burgers after running a couple of miles.  I'm only started to run a few days ago to beat my high school mile time (5:50) from back in the days when I was in shape.  This was my first time going to Red Robin and I actually was planning to go back in California but never did.  I came here around 7:30pm on a Wednesday night and it wasn't busy.  The interior was brightly lit and it had that ""family feel"" to it (and it wasn't due to the fact that almost every table were kids). My friend recommended the Bleu Ribbon Burger ($8.99) so that's what I ordered.  I saw other burgers on the menu that looked good and sounded good as well; however, I'd take a recommendation if it was my first time being anywhere.  The burger came with bottomless steak fries which was pretty good.  In my opinion, steak fries were the best fries to eat. My waitress gave me a basket of fries while I waited for the burger to come out so I had something to eat.  She was super nice and occasionally asked me if everything was good.  My burger finally came out and I took my pictures.  After that, I began to eat it and it was pretty good!  I was full after I finished it and I think it had something to do with the fact that I ate a basket of fries beforehand.  I managed to finish the rest of the steak fries but barely. lol I'm coming back to fulfill my burger cravings and to try the other burgers on the menu!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty
Carrie C.,"Kansas City, MO",104,148,52,2.0,8/10/2014,"Red Robin puts up a powerful front. Their commercials catch your eye and the idea of bottomless fries beckon you to their doors but... my trip to Red Robin is not at all something I wish to repeat.  No, no, no, there wasn't a bug in my food, the waiter didn't give us a horrible attitude, and I didn't get sick. But truth be told, I'd rather have something to talk about rather than have nothing to talk about. And that's just the thing. Nothing here was memorable, and it was completely lacking in every possible way.  Now I'll be fair, my turkey club was good. If I were to ever come again (which, wouldn't be my choice, I'll admit) I would probably order it. The sandwich itself is probably the only thing that let me give the place 2 stars. The fries are pretty basic steak style fries, they just aren't the kind that keep me craving more - and on this visit, they came out a little cold. Although, I think that might just be because the restaurant itself was freezing.  Our waiter seemed distracted and only stopped by once after our initial order. It's not that he was unpleasant - he was nice when he stopped by, however he was inattentive to any refills (we didn't get a single one nor did he even ask), and forgot to place a milkshake order one of us had made. What disappoints me is that the restaurant wasn't really all that busy. Maybe half of the tables were filled? And they had plenty of waitstaff around, so it's lost on me as to why he was having trouble with our table. At the end of our meal, we had to pull another waiter to the side to get our tabs.  I'm actually really disappointed in Red Robin. If anyone knows me, I hate writing negative reviews. On the outside, it sounds like a neat place for a good dinner, and many of their burgers and sandwiches sound good. But unfortunately, I very seriously doubt that I'll be back to try any more of them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty
Jack B.,,2,10,,3.0,10/5/2012,"A couple of nights ago my dad and I paid a visit to the Red Robin in Liberty, MO.  This was my first visit to this location since the disappointing take-out last month.  Tonight, Dad and I dined in.  This time the experience was a vast improvement over the previous one. Overall, it was a positive experience.  A couple of things though did miss the mark and, if this were a greasy spoon dive, I would have taken it in stride.  However, this restaurant has a ""#1 Zagat Ranked"" sign on the door so I expected more when dining here. One of the staff cheerfully greeted us at the door and the hostess promptly seated us.  There was no silverware or napkins on the table and the hostess didn't seem to notice so either she wasn't trained to notice, she didn't think it was her job to notice or, at this restaurant, it actually isn't her job to notice. The server was prompt too.  After he welcomed us, I asked him for a couple of set-ups while we looked over the menu since he didn't seem to notice either or care.   The server came back in a few minutes and told us that the silverware was just coming out of the dishwasher and it would be a couple of more minutes for the set-ups.  The server then brought us a basket of fries with some type of sauce.  We weren't familiar with the sauce and it wasn't exactly to our liking so I tried to add some ketchup to it but the ketchup bottle was almost empty; empty to the point where it sputtered and spit all over when I tried to squeeze some ketchup out.   Fries are a big part of the menu at a burger restaurant.  I would expect that it would be routine to check the ketchup bottle when a table is bussed.  I guess that was missed in the training. The server stopped by again to tell us that the set-ups were still not ready and I asked for a new bottle of ketchup.  The server brought us our burgers and fries and returned a minute later holding up a couple of table knives indicating that that was all that was ready.  I had to tell him that all we really needed was some napkins since we were just having burgers and fries.  He promptly brought the napkins to the table. The restaurant was only about half full and the bar area was practically empty and the dishwasher couldn't keep up?  In addition, we were eating finger food this time.  I wonder if restaurant had been busier or we had ordered something that actually required silverware to eat, would we have had to let our food set while we waited for silverware or, would they have just stopped serving such food until the dishwasher caught up? As to the food, my dad had the Bacon Cheeseburger and I had the Royal Red Robin Burger.  Both burgers and the fries were very good.  It was the first burger and fries in our hunt for a good burger joint that my dad has said that he really liked.  While I enjoyed them as well, I have noticed that every time that I have eaten Red Robin burgers I run out of burger before I run out of bun.  Personally, I would like to have an equal burger to bun ratio. One of the mangers did stop by to check on us when we were almost done with the meal (we didn't see the server again until it was time for the check).  I didn't bring up the earlier oversights to him since there was nothing he could do for us at that point.  Unfortunately, his demeanor made his visit seem obligatory rather than genuine. As I said at the beginning, overall it was a positive experience.  I do think there are still some training issues and, maybe, some management commitment issues at this Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty?start=40

As well, restaurant side is great for families, balloons and all. The restaurant looks clean and I've had great service every time. I find the prices to be not much higher than fast food burgers and better selection by far.

Sarah M.,"Manhattan, KS",4,15,6,3.0,7/31/2015,"My visit started off pretty well but nothing special. Our food was taking a while so the waiter brought us some yummy fries and our choice of dipping sauces to hold us over. Our food was brought out shortly after we finished our fries. I asked for the ghost pepper sauce for my ghost tavern jalapeño burger (something like that) to be on the side, but it was not in my basket.  It took the waiter probably ten minutes or so to check back in and notice the sauce was missing, but I do have to acknowledge the fact that the place was PACKED. I never saw the waiter stand around. He was always helping someone, but it did affect the service at my table so it was still a bit disappointing.  My burger was pretty good, but there were only four small fresh jalapeños and two dime-sized fried jalapeños total. That's not much to cover the burger. The ghostpepper sauce did have a nice salsa-base and spicy kick which made up for some of the disappointment with the burger.  Overall, my experience was pretty average, and I almost chose to rate four stars. I think maybe extra staff would help with the problems that come with a busy restaurant-the food looking like it was rushed to be made, the slow check-ins, less drink refills, and less delicious bottomless fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty?start=20

William H.,"Kansas City, MO",18,182,390,4.0,6/12/2011,"I gave this place four stars.  I'm rating it against other chain outfits though.  Red Robin has nothing on a good old fashioned handmade burger at a mom and pop owned diner.   There are a couple of things I really like about it.  Back in the early 90's, while visiting Australia, I discovered the joys of a burger with a fried egg on top.  It's a combination that has to be tasted to be believed.  FANTASTIC!  I've searched high and low in the U.S. for places that do this and came up with only two.  One of them is Red Robin.  They're also one of the few places around that will cook your burger to order.  I prefer a medium burger so it's nice to find a place that's still willing to do that. Another thing I like about Red Robin is the bottomless fries.  They'll bring you as many tubs as you like although one is really sufficient.  It's nice to know that you can have more if you're still hungry.  I like to pay a little extra to have them loaded.  Very savory.  Red Robin also has some very tasty shakes.   The service at the one in Liberty is mediocre.  The staff is working as hard as they can but, unfortunately for them, they always seem to be a little understaffed.  The servers always appear to be hustling and doing the best they can but it sometimes isn't quite enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty?start=20
Amy A.,"Kansas City, MO",1,12,3,2.0,11/6/2013,"Heard good things about Red Robin, so we gave it a try. It is a fun atmosphere! Balloons, kids, music, etc... I think the burgers are good, but a bit overpriced for well, a burger. First time... our waiter almost completely ignored us. We eventually got our order placed, and once our food came, we never saw him again. I literally had to flag someone else down to get our ticket. Forget about drink refills.  Second time... The waiter was very nice. But, again issues with the service. I ordered iced tea to drink, and there was no sweetener on any tables... Anywhere. I guess you have to ask for it. When our food came (literally the next time I saw the waiter!) I asked for some, and he did deliver. But I wish I had been able to enjoy my iced tea before my meal.  In conclusion, I think they must have some training issues, particularly with the wait staff. They are nice, but really need to get it together. So.... We have tried the Liberty Location twice now, and we are done. Sorry.  :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty?start=20
Josh B.,"Lee's Summit, MO",17,182,8,3.0,6/29/2014,"I like Red Robin's food. There is no getting around that. But this one is loud loud loud. The music is blaring. I was sat next to the kitchen area, and they had a radio on blaring a different kind of music. Kids everywhere screaming and yelling. The tv's were turned up. So having a conversation with the people at the table? Nope not happening. I have been to other Red Robins, and it hasn't been like that. Unless you are dying for a burger with an egg on it, I might give this one a pass.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty?start=20
Mike R.,"Satellite Beach, FL",8,10,1,5.0,12/7/2013,"Very friendly staff and manager. Great GlutenFree menu, with burger buns that hold together far better than many encountered elsewhere.

Diana M.,"Hartford, KS",14,15,3,5.0,9/21/2015,"We had a great time out with our friends and our families. We were found two tables to seat our group of 13 beside each other. They even found the table rather quickly even though they were packed for a Saturday night. Our waiter, Austin, was amazing and we were never left with empty drinks or without a plate of bottomless fries! Many of the kids chose the happy face pizza or the cheeseburger from the kids menu. You know it is good when 8 children eat all of it plus a lot of the steak fries as well. All of the adults ordered different types of cheeseburgers which were cooked and seasoned to perfection. In fact I am the only one who had to take half home after indulging in their campfire sauce and fries! We can't wait to go back again as this was the best food and service we have had in a long time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty?start=20
P H.,"Kansas City, MO",0,10,,1.0,6/14/2015,"I hate to do this, because I typically love taking my family to Red Robin, but we had a HORRIBLE experience at this location. First of all, it took a very long time for our server to come out and greet us and take a drink order. We're talking probably 15 minutes. That's too long. When we finally ordered our drinks, they were out of lemonade and milk for the kids. It was 1 PM, and they weren't that busy. Ok, so we moved past that, but then... It took probably 40 minutes after ordering our food before it arrived. We were never asked if we wanted bottomless fries while we waited or sorry that we were waiting so long. Nope. Just got to sit and wonder because our waiter was MIA. So once our food FINALLY came out, one person was missing an item they ordered and was told they were out of that item (no offer for replacement), 2 of the meals had the wrong sides, an ice cream dish was so freezer burnt it was inedible, and one burger had to be sent back because the meat was not cooked. And by not cooked, I mean it was so bloody and red in the middle I thought it was going to start mooing at me. It was supposed to be well done. That got the attention of the manager who did come out and talk to us, but the damage has already been done, Red Robin. You lost a loyal customer. Get it together before you lose more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty?start=20
Jessica C.,"Liberty, MO",0,14,1,4.0,9/22/2014,"I am a little surprised by all of the bad reviews about this specific location. I have eaten here frequently and haven't had a bad experience. My food is always hot and tastes great.  The waiters/waitresses have been friendly and are quick to take our drink orders, food orders, and offer us baskets of fries while we wait. They have been very understanding and helpful when it comes to their Gluten Free options for some of my family members.  My only complaint is how overwhelming it can be when it's packed with people, it's very loud when it's crowded but it's supposed to be a fun, family-welcoming establishment so that isn't something that can be helped. If this bothers you then I would avoid going during dinner hours (5-7 ish) and just stick to lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty?start=20

Diane N.,"Limerick, PA",27,103,1,1.0,1/31/2010,If you are in the mood for a noisy restaurant with a limited menu of over priced hamburgers...look no more. The fries are nothing special.  There was a lady walking around blowing up balloons for children. The children were shrieking and running around the place following her. It was as if I was trapped in a McDonald's playland.  For 2 burgers and 1 iced tea and 1 coke...$24.00.  Not at all worth it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty?start=20

Andrea C.,"Gower, MO",1,16,,4.0,5/26/2013,I like Red Robin. Yes it can be noisy with kids but you have to kind of expect that from someplace who specializes in burgers and fries. Definately not McDonald's.  We have eaten there several times at the Liberty Mo and Olathe Ks locations. We have been there when it was busy and slow and have always gotten good service. A manager has always checked on us at least once during our visits and I have seen a manager taking food to tables during really busy times. I like the burgers and think they are a good size and the fries have always been plentiful and hot.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty?start=20
