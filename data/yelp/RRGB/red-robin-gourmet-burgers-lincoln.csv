Victoria B.,"Newcastle, CA",3,28,7,5.0,10/22/2017,"This is my favorite go to restaurant in Lincoln. There is rarely if ever a wait for a table at the times we go (usually early dinner). The lunch rush can be pretty busy especially in the bar room but we did find a table. (Self seating in the bar- find a table and take it). The servers are usually on task and attentive. I actually like the table top check pay option, no waiting for a bill, change,etc-just pay and go! The burgers have always been fresh, juicy and full of flavor. The fries are good with unlimited refills. They will alter or make substitutions without a fuss and unless it's a premium upgrade, it's no cost! If you like turkey burgers, theirs is perfectly seasoned and juicy-really the best turkey patty I think I've ever had. The condiments they offer are also very good. And the campfire sauce, in my opinion, is so delicious I could drink it!  I haven't ordered a burger I didn't like but the Siracha double tavern is my current favorite, a perfect blend of flavors and just the right size. Don't forget to ask for campfire sauce on the side for dipping your fries an adding to the burger!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln
Quincy Y.,"Lincoln, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/25/2017,"One of the worst dining experiences I've had in a long time. I should have known it would be bad when we called to check wait times and were put on hold for 15 minutes. When we arrived, they told us to wait on the bench while they seated others who came in after us. Once seated, we were forced to wait around another 10 minutes for our server to offer us drinks, although we were ready to order food at that point. Our server was very rude and made us repeat ourselves multiple times when we were speaking quite clearly and loudly. He got things wrong and we had to correct him, almost writing down broccoli when we clearly said salad. My sister did not receive the usual request of ""pink or no pink"" for her burger and did not get to choose her cheese. She also choked on a huge hair found in her burger and almost threw up. The server and manager proceeded to make excuses and dodge responsibility. Incompetence in almost every regard by the staff and an all around TERRIBLE dining experience. Management needs to make serious changes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln
Emma K.,"Lincoln, CA",18,1,,1.0,11/24/2017,"Worst Red Robin I've ever been to.  Was on hold for 15 minutes on the phone just to see the wait time. The waiter didn't talk to us for 10 minutes.  Was very rude to us when taking the order. Yelling ""I can't hear a word you're saying to my little brothers that are in elementary school. I have celiac desiese, so I ordered a gluten free but and gluten free fries. When the waiter didn't ask me if it was an allergy I told him that it was indeed and allergy and he responded ""well, yeah""   Once I got my food I took one bite into my burger and chocked on a hair. I was hacking and coughing at the table then proceeded to run to the bathroom. When I got back to the table (with the hair still stuck in my throat) the waiter and some guy came over and told me that the cooks were wearing hats...  After they left, I went to eat my ""gluten free fries"" they had seasoning salt on them. (Not gluten free)  I work at a Red Robin and I know how things SHOULD go. This was horrible. Worst restaurant experience I've ever had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln
Sandy J.,"Roseville, CA",26,167,621,3.0,5/14/2017,"Spent time with family. Upon arrival, surprised it was not busy. Waited to be seated. Then we saw a another family come thru the doors and got sat immediately...  When our time came, we ended up near the kitchen. Not a good place to be, unless you want to hear a loud manager yell ,"" Who wants to work a double shift tomorrow!"" ..., or the cooks playing around in the kitchen.  Maybe it was because we had a baby and the hostess didn't want us around others'. Who knows, but it could have been better seating.  Our utensils very extremely dirty and I asked the waitress to bring us cleaner ones. They ended up being  the same ones. Oh well... I guess that explains why this restaurant was empty.  The food was good by the way and my family always make a uncomfortable time enjoyable regardless!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln
Rekha S.,"Sanger, CA",123,152,907,3.0,6/19/2017,"So,I was in the area for a work conference and stopped in at this Red Robin. It was during lunch time not too busy service seemed rushed. Food was decent/ fries could have been less greasy. Con- afterwards we wanted to pay and they have this machine at the table to pay with card. It was not user friendly and we wanted to also pay cash obviously it does not accept cash. Our server should have just took our payment instead of having us trying to pay for it ourselves at the table. Can be time consuming.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln
Annette H.,"Rocklin, CA",79,262,618,4.0,11/30/2016,"We love this Red Robin.  I mean, all of the Red Robins we go to are pretty awesome, but this one is closer to home and less crowded than the Roseville Galleria location.   We usually go for the Avo-Cobb-O salad with honey mustard, the Ensenada Chicken Platter, or a burger so we can share the endless steak fries.  My husband and I both love the Honey Mustard (Poppy?) dressing.   All the servers here have been great.  Most recently, we have been impressed by serve Noe's attentive service.  He is awesome! Make sure to sign up for their Red Robin Rewards loyalty program.  You get a free item after your 10th, as well as a birthday burger during your birthday month.   Plenty of parking in this center.  Located near the Big 5 Sporting Goods store and Lowe's.   Red Robin, YUMMMMM!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln
Joe K.,"Rocklin, CA",233,197,162,4.0,12/31/2016,"I love this Red Robin. I live right between the one in Roseville across from the Galleria and this one in Lincoln. I have been to both many times but I prefer this one in Lincoln. It's got a nice parking lot where finding a space has never been an issue. The location is clean and well-taken care of. The employees are always friendly. Whenever we come here, we try to get a booth inside the bar area. You don't have to wait for a table with the hostess. Just walk into the bar and see if there are any seats available. This is perfect for catching a game while enjoying some awesome food and drink. I've had the pleasure of having Noe take care of my wife and I whenever we sit at the bar. He is always friendly, enthusiastic about his work, and efficient. He always comes back to check on us to see if we need a refill on beverages or fries. It's almost like he knows when our glasses or basket of fries are nearing empty and in need of a refill. I've seen his interaction with other customers and he is just as friendly and awesome. He recognizes us and never disappoints with his service. My favorite menu items are: Avo-cobb-o salad with honey mustard dressing or the guacomole bacon burger. It's even good if you substitute the beef patty with either a turkey patty or the Boca patty.... yes, I said Boca patty. It's the best veggie substitute that tastes close to beef. without having the funky texture. The garlic fries are awesome but you can't go wrong with the regular fries. If you get garlic fries, there is an extra charge though but it is bottomless. Whichever fries you order, make sure to get honey mustard on the side. This is hands down the best honey mustard anywhere. Can't find an analog in the grocery stores or other restaurants. If you are a honey mustard fan, this is the bomb. I wish I could buy this. It's that good. The strawberry lemonade is always often but I am particular to the peach iced tea. It's not as sweet as the strawberry lemonade but just as refreshing. I love coming here because it is not overwhelmingly crowded and not hectic. This is a great location for a yummy meal. Other locations, you will have to fight for parking, wait for a table, and feel like your cramped. Not at this Lincoln location. It's just an awesome location. If you have a chance to eat in the bar area, I hope that you have a chance to be taken care of by Noe. He's a great employee.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln
Kevin L.,"Lincoln, CA",31,104,34,3.0,6/3/2017,"It's improved a bit, and I no longer recommend the restaurant at strikes under any circumstances, it is truly garbage.

Ursula O.,"Lincoln, CA",1045,288,720,5.0,4/12/2016,"Our amazing dining experience couldn't have been done without our server, Logan! We arrived on a busy Friday night. The small wait at the front door didn't intimidate us, knowing that the bar area is open seating (21 and over at all times,)we decided to high tail it over there and easily found open tables & booths. Red Robin has changed over the years. It got away from its Red diner look and has gone into a more modern look. Sleek wooden framed booths, dark glass dividers, more tv's...  more appealing to the adult eye...steering away from the family oriented restaurant it has always been known for.  Anyways,  My bff and I sat at the table next to the kitchen to watch the action. Servers, bussers, and 1 or 2 kitchen staff flying through the doors...made me think of Chef Ramsey, he could be bursting through the doors any second saying something absurd... Lol Logan greeted us right away. He was energetic, knowledgeable, and when we ordered appetizers, he showed us how to do it on the table device. So smart! We only waited a short period of time for my wedge salad. It looked perfect! My friend ordered chili cheese fries. Since it needed to have melted cheese, it took a few minutes longer. We paid on the little device on the table. It's much faster, easier, and more convenient for the servers on a busy night. It allows you to split your check, leave a top, and do a small survey.... I personally like the device :-) Our food was delicious, Logan was always around,making sure our food was good, asked what else we wanted... he was on top of things the whole time! Thank you, Logan and thank you Red Robin for an quick awesome dinner!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln
Maria C.,"Rocklin, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/17/2017,Took the family out last Saturday and paid thru the kiosk tool on the table. At the end of paying the kiosk had an error come up. Waitress said my payment didn't go through. I pulled up my banking info on my phone and showed where the charge is pending..so thought that would be enough. She brought the manager over and I showed her the same...They both confirmed that it wasn't going to go through and they closed that ticket. Made me run my card again which I didn't want to do. But my bank account wasn't enough proof for these people. Well guess what BOTH charges came out 2 days later and I'm still waiting to get my money back. Called and spoke to couple of different managers and get same response...I.T. is working on it...never get a courtesy call like promised..just horrible!!

The utensils never seem to be entirely clean, the hamburgers look like the thin dry patties you get in bulk from the freezer section. The plates they serve on are strange orange plastic plates, like something you would use camping, or give a child to throw on the ground.  I do not recommend coming to this restaurant.

Kimberly D.,"Roseville, CA",25,119,49,5.0,6/22/2017,I love this place!  I'm pretty simple i always sit in the bar and the two guys that usually work in there are amazing! if you get Logan you'll never need to ask for a refill on your drinks. the other guy totally forget his name sorry it's also pretty amazing and always willing to offer up suggestions for beers. I usually get the Smokey Tavern double on a lettuce bun. I always get all the Fry's I need and I usually dip em in there Ranch campfire sauce or the buffalo sauce they have it's really amazing. I've sat in the regular dining area twice and I've always had great service as well never a complaint.

Do not visit here if you are craving Res Robin, you will be disappointed.  Service was good. Our server was friendly.  Food was not good.

Karen M.,"Rio Oso, CA",0,14,,1.0,1/1/2018,"I've only been to Red Robin a handful of times my whole life.  But the first couple times I went, I remember enjoying it.  Usually when we go out we pick Indian, Thai, or Japanese over anything else.  Over the years I've lost my taste for the larger chain restaurants.  But the other night we decided to take the whole family to Red Robin.  The service was decent.  I was concerned about that because of the reviews.  But we got in and were served pretty quickly.  But the California Chicken burger that I used to enjoy years ago was different from how I remembered it.  I remember it being more crisp.  But now it's soggy.  Overall, it was pricey for what we got, and most of us just felt icky after we left.  Also I ordered one of the special tequila margaritas.  So I paid several dollars more for a better brand of tequila, but I could tell that they skimped on the tequila.   Add to that there was a $1.99 entertainment fee added to the bill -presumably because my husband poked around for a few seconds on the device that was sitting on the table.   All together we spent over $25 more than if we'd gone to a good Indian or Thai restaurant, and it wasn't nearly as satisfying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln
Wes S.,"Lincoln, CA",41,354,23,4.0,1/30/2017,"I did something I have NEVER done before when coming to Red Robin. EVER!!! I didn't eat a single French fry. How terrible is that?!?! VERY!!! Stupid diet. Stupid love handles. Stupid will power. Geez, just give in and eat ONE French fry. Sorry, sometimes you need to argue with yourself.  I didn't even order a burger if ANY kind. Even left the chicken sandwiches alone. I went with the chicken avocado Cobb salad. 550 calories and 60 grams of protein. It had chicken, avo, bacon, eggs and tomatoes on it. Pretty good.

Joel S.,"Lincoln, CA",24,108,82,2.0,5/8/2017,"So in Lincoln we are somewhat limited to restaurants. Of course right down the road there are plenty of options but when we want to stay local we only have so many. We have frequented Red Robin multiple times at this location with normally positive things to say. The service is generally great, drinks are cold and delicious and the food is quickly prepared. However, yesterday we decided to drop in for a late lunch and grab some food. Service was so-so for it being slow. The food on the other hand was super bland. We had artichoke dip that was not good, small portion and just not flat out not good. We both had wraps that were dry, not tight. The wife had avocado that looked like it was sitting out for 2 hours. Red Robin is generally a solid choice that is consistent. This particular visit wasn't so much and I wanted to reflect that in a yelp review with hopes of them stepping up there service and product. Hell, I worked at a Red Robin forever ago. Its not that hard. Cheers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln?start=20
Yolanda R.,"Yuba City, CA",243,453,13368,3.0,6/8/2015,"We came in for a Sunday lunch, and it was also my 10th Free item Rewards! The Best thing about RR is the Royalty Rewards and it is a nice treat to know you always get a Free Birthday burger on your Birthday month.  I think by now, I have used them the last 4 years and gotten at least 4 Free Birthday burgers, but this is the first time I can remember getting a Free 10th item! We got service by Victoria, she was very nice, helpful, and checked on us.  I highly recommend trying the Orange cream soda because as someone who rarely drinks soda, this was delicious and perfectly fizzy!!!!  It is everything I imagine a 1950's style soda shop would serve.  The flavor was awesome because I really love Orange creamsicles ice cream pops since I was a kid and that is exactly what the soda flavor reminded me of. I highly recommend trying the burgers, you definitely can't go wrong and there are sooo many choices to choose from!  Plus, enjoying bottomless french fries is pretty cool, which are cut like thick steak fries!  The most I've ever been able to eat is two servings, but the second refill always taste better because it is usually piping hot fresh.  We were asked a couple times if we wanted more fries, but two servings is always enough!   I like all their dipping sauces too, very tasty and even if I have to pay extra 50 cents or whatever, I really do not mind at all.  Every table has their Signature Blend seasoning, which is good and they also sell them, if you want to buy one to take home!  I like the new S & P grinders, those are actually very nice to have available compared to a regular Salt & Pepper shakers. I have tried a lot of their menu items over the years.  I definitely like RR waaay more than Chili's or Applebees, so this would always be my first preference.  The menu has good options and a variety of different choices, prices are very reasonable.   I love the French Onion soup,  I always order it!  They have great appetizers, I haven't tried much of the desserts though.  Their Strawberry Freckled Lemonade is AMAZING, I really like the Purple Popping drink too.  They have a pretty good Happy Hour if you want to order alcohol cocktail drinks or beers. The Southwest Chicken salad is one of my favorite things to order!!!  It's super good and Healthy.   I recently tried the Avo Cobb O salad and that was pretty good too, it's a big size and worth the $10.99 for all the toppings you get!  It comes with focaccia bread and that was yummy!  I feel like since the menu changed, and some RR restaurants got remodeled, it's just gotten so much better!  It's a nice family place too, you can bring your kids or grand parents or have large groups/small groups!  There is something for everyone to enjoy dining together. I am glad I had a good lunch experience here.  Thank you Victoria and Red Robin staff in Lincoln, CA.  The location was easy to find, tons of parking, and it's in a very nice area with other businesses, very close to Lowe's.   They also have cool bicycle parking here, you can ride your bike and have a decent place to lock it up at.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln?start=20

This is the worst one I've ever been to.  Food was pretty decent actually--fries were great as usual but it's pretty hard to screw up fries so... Like I mentioned earlier, it's SUPER UNDERSTAFFED! I went on a Monday night and it was pretty full, but somehow they found a way to make it so our receipt took practically seven years and 20 ""I'll be right back with your receipt""s to arrive at our table. The bill was paid but we didn't know that until we got our receipt seven years later because the stupid table kiosk said the purchase didn't go through. We tried to use the kiosk twice.

Oh, and what's so monstrous about the Monster Shakes?!?  The chocolate malt shake was puny and I could barely discern any malt at all.  I think I am done with the Red Robin chain (the Yuba City location is even worse). Also, I second all the complaints about the fries.  Why are they being so stingy with a food item that is so cheap for them to serve?  They bring them out 10 fries at a time and take 20 minutes to bring more, of course after you have to ask for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln?start=20
Jon G.,"Roseville, CA",48,7,,1.0,3/31/2017,"I have never been a huge fan of Red Robin's but generally it's adequate to good. This Res Robin was one of my worst dining experiences ever. Right off the bat with the host did this place already turn me off of it. I walk in and there's no one at the podium, ok that's fine, as I wait I'm looking around and I see an employee in the dining area straight ahead talking to two gentlemen at the table. I figured he was the host and being genial with patrons, so at first I was fine with the wait. After quite a few minutes he walks up and seats me in the same area as those guys he was talking to and here is when I find out that they weren't guest but merely his coworkers that were on break. He made me wait pointlessly just because he wanted to gossip and not do his damn job. This was strike number one for this place. Once we are seated my waitress wasn't that polite and welcoming at all. Was rushing us a bit but hey we came in at a bit before 9:00PM maybe she was getting off soon, so I can forgive her a bit. She took our orders and the appetizers arrived promptly afterward. The cheese sticks were good but the tavern fries were just depressing, the fries were cold and the cheese wasn't fully melted. Every time I would grab a fry to try another one hoping the previous one was a fluke and eventually it'll be good but it never happened. Finally after that pile of depression our burgers arrived and it did not get any better. I got the black & bleu burger and something about the flavor just didn't taste right compared to previous Red Robin's. I took 3 bites and called it a day. The side of fries that came with was just another spiral of depression with how far this rabbit hole of disgust could go. My girlfriend said her burger was bad and that we could've got tastier food from dumpster diving behind an Applebee's that shared a dumpster with a dog kennel.  Overall I will only ever come to this Red Robin again if I'm forced by gunpoint to go in though I'd rather taste the bullet than taste the food here ever again.

I've been coming here since they've opened and it it was the only place in town to eat in town after 8 pm when my son played baseball.  Although I've never thought it was great, I was never compelled to share my thoughts. UNTIL NOW.  Thought by sitting on the bar side we'd receive attentive service.  Oops.  Why bother with servers when I ask to order an appetizer and she tells me to put it through the kiosk? I should have realized at the beginning she has ZERO interest in interacting with her customers.  I could go on and on from there but in the interest of time (and boring the reader to death) I won't. She could learn a ton from her co-worker (super nice guy with the beard that values his customers.) Cold soggy food, inattentive server and a receipt that won't print out. All of this for $80 for a party of three. In addition to all that they're out of Kendall Jackson Chardonnay on a Friday at 6 p.m. My choices were horrible house wine or no name pinot grigio. UGH.  How this happens at the beginning of a weekend is beyond me.  Clearly they're relying on that they are the only game in town.

We placed an order to go not too long ago, they told us the food would be ready in a half hour. We showed up for pick up forty minutes later and ended up having to wait another 25 minutes for our food.

Katie Y.,"Roseville, CA",2,25,,1.0,12/22/2015,"What has happened to Red Robin??? This used to be a fun place to go with the family, but now it's just annoying with those money sucking, distracting tablets on the table. Not to mention it takes up room. Service is subpar and quality of food is where Red Robin really fails! My kids used to love coming here for the burgers and I was happy they had good salads. The last time we came here, my son ordered a cheeseburger and the meat and cheese looked like it had been sitting under the heat lamp for 30 min or so. His fries were cold too. Oh, And I wonder if they don't do the ""bottomless fries"" anymore because we never got any before our meal and were never asked if we wanted more.  My BBQ chicken salad was awful! Lacked flavor and lettuce was disgusting. Chunks of iceberg lettuce that was all brown and the ""mixed greens"" were brown too. The quality of what was served was definitely not worth $11 for a salad at all!! I've had prepackaged salad from the store that was much fresher and tastier.  I'm really disappointed at this chain. It is not like it used to be. I would really like to see them get rid of those tablets, I think they're annoying and a waste of space. If people really want to play games, I'm sure they will use their phones/iPad/tablet in which they already pay for. Or maybe, they will have conversations with each other like the old days. Also, if the restaurant is dying down a bit after the dinner rush, please train your servers to be aware of their surroundings. No one wants to hear or be around immature behavior. I won't comment on what we witnessed, but try and act a little professional even if it's your time to go home.

We have been here probably 20 times.  Most of our visits were with district school kids prior to school social events. Regardless of visit, one thing is common, the service is VERY slow.  Sometimes, it has been horrifyingly slow.  Our last visit, our waitress was downright (for lack of better term) surly/obnoxious--almost making fun of how our group of 20 was demanding too much (after waiting nearly 20 minutes just for drink orders.) Look....we are Red Robin fans, and frankly we REALLY want to see this location improve.  It is my hope that Manager or Owner sees these reviews and will agree, time to REALLY address service. This location isn't even fun to visit, so we choose to go to another location. With all that said, the food is sub par at best.  Often cold, forget about asking for condiments or special requests OR even being asked for fry refill.

Our waitress was so inundated that she forgot a few things with our meal and took her awhile to give us refills.  A few times I even caught her chatting with other employees instead of checking with her customers. As for the ""bottomless fries""...it takes the act of congress to get them and when we received them, they were sitting under a hot lamp for a while.

When our bill came, we had TWO appetizers charged on it! My burger was ok but my husband's was not well seasoned.  The cutlery was not clean.   I ordered sweetener for my tea and didn't get it until asking twice.  The wrong sauce was brought with the crummy appetizer...

I've even emailed the corporate office a copy of online complaints from a local Facebook group from many...many...many...unhappy locals.  It's truly disappointing Red Robin doesn't care about this location. The service is just mediocre.  My last visit was this past Sunday for a friend's birthday and the air conditioning wasn't working AND they didn't have hardboiled eggs.  But did offer to substitute them for cucumbers. Really? I wanted eggs for protein, not cucumbers.  I believe this location has a lackluster management and too relaxed of an employee-management atmosphere.  On another visit I witneased the manager on duty drinking a soda back in the area where employees get customer beverages,  food, etc.  This is a no-no!  On another visit,  the same manager is casually chatting with an employee as we walked in the door. Instead of promptly walking to the front and greeting us, he continued to chit-chat while we waited.  :( Lastly waiting for bottomless fries takes forever and when I ask for a well done burger, on more than one occasion, it comes out pink. Servers are always more than willing to take back the burger and are very apologetic, but they just need to step up their game and get things done right the first time.

As I'm sure the reviews have said, they rebranded Red Robin about a year ago and the burgers are much, much better. And more expensive! Unfortunately, service has not improved. Bottomless fries?

Today, I went here for Mother's Day along with my in-laws, wife and son. The waiter checked on us about 2 bites in and never came until it was time to pay. Well, I wanted more fries.

Eric M.,"Lincoln, CA",57,32,2,1.0,5/2/2015,"Today was our youngest son's 4th birthday, so we took him to the Red Robin here in town to celebrate.  This has become a birthday tradition as you get a free meal on your birthday and it is a fun place to celebrate, especially for kids.  Our kids look forward to this birthday treat, and rightly so, our birthday boy was excited to go.  He talked about it all day.  Upon arriving he proudly announced to the server, as did my husband and I, that today was his birthday and that he was 4 years old.  He beamed with excitement. The server smiled and said that she would be sure to sing to him.  He was beyond thrilled to hear that.  After everyone was done eating dinner the server plopped down an ice cream sundae without saying a word and walked away.  My husband and I exchanged looks.  She returned a few minutes later and said ""Happy Birthday, little guy"" as she cleared some plates and walked away.  That was it.  Our son just sat there looking at his sundae.  I could tell that he was crushed.  We started singing to him, but just as we started a group of servers congregated at the table directly NEXT to ours as there were two birthdays being celebrated there.  The servers started singing 'Happy Birthday' to them.  Our son turned around in his chair and watched this take place.  When they were done singing the group of servers left and our son sat down in his chair and pushed his ice cream sundae away with tears in his eyes.  I was speechless.  Before I could even say anything to our son the servers returned to sing to that same table for a SECOND time because one of the persons celebrating their birthday had been in the bathroom when they sang the first time.  As they walked away -AGAIN- my son climbed into my lap and started to cry, saying, ""why didn't they sing for me? I ate my whole dinner and I was a good listener.""  I was crushed.  How do you explain to a 4 year old little boy that the server was possibly having an off night or whatever the reason was for her to be so thoughtless.  I worked in the restaurant industry as a server while in high school and college.  I get that it is a hard and an often times thankless job, but regardless I find tonight hard to excuse.  I talked to the manager on our way out and I honestly felt like he wanted to start laughing at my complaint.  I don't think you have to be a parent to know the importance of a birthday to a child.  My wife and I like to support local businesses here in town, but we will not go to Red Robin again.  This is not the first time we have had horrible service there.  We have been back several times since, hoping it would get better but tonight was a deciding factor for us. Update:  Since posting this review, I was offered a $10 gift card from Red Robin.  I declined to accept this gift card.  A gift card will not change the experience that I received and I will not be returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln?start=60

So we need Red Robin to offset the local small places that are hit-and -miss  ( Awful Annie's ) . Especially since there aren't enough good burger joints in Lincoln. Fatburger is in the casino, but you have to walk yourself and your kids through a smelly sleazy casino to get there- and it's just not worth it in the end.

Mike G.,"Lincoln, CA",2,21,11,1.0,1/25/2016,"My wife and I were regulars here. Once a week we ate dinner here and for a short while it was always great. The staff was very attentive, we got fries and drinks refilled before they were gone. There was 1 bar tender who has akways been amazing, she always remembered us and was very friendly. (Still is, just havent seen her in a while.) As time went on, the portions became smaller and the fries ended up not being bottomless any more. We started having to ask for refills. Our food came out late and cold. The staff seemed to have an issue just doing their job. Mind you, we have always been very generous tippers. For that reason, the staff remembered us. With a few changes to the employees and evidently policies, service declined drastically. we finally had enough and took a long break. after about 4 months we decided to try take out. surprise, the same issues arose. I made the mistake of tipping the girl who handed me the bag (a random employee I haven't seen since), walking out and driving home without checking the bag. I get home to find my wife's entire meal is missing. when I called they gave me attitude and actually asked me if I was sure. I insisted they made a mistake and I wanted it corrected. they offered to ""remake"" it if I would come back. yes, red robin, I lied. I wanted a free entree. seriously? I spoke with the manager and he had the same attitude. so, I drive back and tell them I want them to make it right. give me a coupon or something. they refused. I then told them I wanted my money back, or at the very least, the tip I left for what seems to be incompetence. nope. so we take a break again. go back a month or two later, I check the bag, missing appetizer and sauce. really? break. again. we go back last night. I specifically ask for extra dipping sauce and au jus. fail again. they have to go in the back and get it. fine. get home... cold tiny portioned food. we live 5 minutes away and arrived on time. why the cold food? absolutely ridiculous. what an awful place to eat. save your money or go to the other one. this place is a joke.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln?start=60

The buns on all of our burgers were cold and squishy. When we asked for new fries, they threw the old fries back in the fryer and tried to pass them off as fresh.

Julie B.,"Lincoln, CA",1,5,,1.0,12/3/2014,"Recently I reluctantly visited Red Robin in Lincoln with my daughter and son. I am aware of their slow inattentive service, but decided I would give them another try in hopes that they have changed or I was wrong. Unfortunately they had proved me right. Mistake number 1. I arrived with a baby who needed a high chair. They place me in a table that was too high for a high chair. Mistake number 2. It took at least over 10 minutes to bring our drinks out. mistake 3. it took over 30 minutes to bring out our appetizer. I mean come on, unacceptable to wait 30 minutes for an appetizer, come on now we are hungry! mistake number 4. I took 20 minutes after they brought the appetizer out to  bring our food out. It was a mess. They never cleared off any dishes so we had a table with a very active baby that was trying to touch everything at the table and it was just about impossible to keep him from the dishes that can break or drinks that can be tipped over. Our dinner took about an hour in half in total. I know that normally a place like that, dinner should be around 45 minutes from start to finish. Overall, I would not go back to this place, nor recommend anyone else to go there unless they do not mind waiting, and waiting and waiting and waiting to get their appetizers and food!   About the food, ya its typical chain restaurant food, nothing special.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln?start=80
Jim A.,"Lincoln, CA",80,2,2,2.0,5/25/2013,"We went to Red Robin yesterday (Friday) at about 5:30PM. The place was about half full. We were greeted by someone at the desk who was about to seat another group, so he asked one of the other front desk staff to seat my group which consisted of me, my wife and our daughter.  He initially checked on one side of the restaurant and there was not a booth available, so we went to the other side. He was about to seat us at a table, but I saw that there were about 7 booths available on that side. When I asked if we could sit in one of the booth's he got an annoyed look on his face, but took us to one of the booth's. At no point after I asked to sit in one of the booth's did he say one more word to us.  He left us there and after about 15 minutes, and watching people who came in after us, a female server came to get our drinks and let us know that she was helping our server who had not yet come to our table. She was friendly and took our drink and appetizer order, which came and were finished before our server made it to our table to take our meal orders. He said very little when he did make it to our table and did not offer any apologies for not taking care of us in a timely manner. The food, when it finally arrived, was good. Our water was refilled once and then we were left with empty water glasses.  One other note. They had a huge sign inside the restaurant about honoring veterans. I am a veteran and had my Navy ball cap on and had asked if Red Robin had a military discount. They do not have a military discount and, based on my experience last night, they do not honor vets.

It seems the individual servers are always overwhelmed or get stuck working on tedious and time consuming tasks while my food is standing on the counter getting cold. This is especially true of tables served directly by the bartender who is responsible for making all the drinks in the place (obviously) . This leaves less time for his/her tables.

Manjit Z.,"Lincoln, CA",205,271,7,3.0,4/19/2011,"We go to Red Robin a lot, and I normally don't write reviews on chain restaurants, but we had an interesting experience.   Red Robin has changed their menu.  So of course I wanted to try one of the new items, and the server informed me that they were all out, no biggie, I just went to my go-to.  The person ordered and the guy took off.  20 minutes later a manager came to us saying that what the ""person"" ordered they are all out of and was apologetic.  He wasn't too happy, he was hungry and at that point didn't want to bother with them.  She kept trying to get him to order something and she finally suggested something that he wanted.   My meal came out first then his.  When our server checked on us he apologized and dropped off the bill and let us know they didn't charge us for the replacement meal.  We're not the type to complain, so it was nice that they did that without us asking.  Sure we were disappointed, but they fixed it and all is right in Red Robin world.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln?start=100

Will L.,"Lincoln, CA",1,33,,2.0,5/23/2012,"Maybe 2.5 stars.   Been here quite a few times.  I like supporting our local Lincoln businesses.  However, the RR is hit and miss.  First few times we came here it was always good.  Prompt service, hot food.  Last few times have been hit and miss.  Like someone else said, the servers are nice enough but something is wrong.   Went their again on 5/17, Open House night for Lincoln schools.  Thankfully we got there right before the mad rush.  Come to find out from our server (who was very nice and over-worked), they sent people home at 6:00 because they weren't busy.  By 7:00 the line was out the door and food took 40+ minutes to come out.  Even getting a refill on fries took 20 minutes. We have had other instances of frozen burgers being served, wrong orders delivered, etc.  It's becoming harder and harder to come back given the other choices in the area.

Brittany E.,"Lincoln, CA",0,12,,4.0,6/17/2015,"This location has generally been good to me and my family. The servers are almost always friendly and polite and the food always good. 99% of the time I get the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Sandwich and it has been consistently good. The fry servings have gotten smaller, but they still do the bottomless refills so it really isn't a problem except if you get an absentee server. This brings me to the negative part of this review: sometimes you get an inattentive server. One who rarely shows at your table and often forgets the things you request. And as good as the food is, it can take a looooong time to get it. It can also take a long time to get that final check.

The first experience was worse than the second, bad enough to make me not want to cone to this one again but those damned fries are delicious. Went in, was one of 3 tables in the restaurant. 2 servers on staff. Took 20 minutes for the guy to take our drink order. When we ordered our food, my sister and I decided to split something and I asked for my side without onions. 20 minutes later the guy brings everyone else's food but not ours, he said they accidentally put onions on it and were making another one. I told him it wasn't a big deal and I could just pick them off. He said he would go check in our stuff. 20 minutes later he comes out and says, ""they haven't brought it out yet?"" I said ""who? You're the waiter. Isn't it your job?"" So he goes and gets it. I ask for ranch and a refill of my yummy freckled lemonaide. He instead starts up a conversation with the Booth behind us about motorcycles. 20 minutes go by. I finally am fuming I turn around and say to the table behind us, ""I'm sure your conversation is super interesting and all but do you think you can shut up for five minutes so our waiter can go refill my lemonaide that I asked him for almost half an hour ago?"" They started laughing and thought it was hilarious, the waiter just stared at me till I said ""uh, lemonaide, go"". I'm normally pretty patient but seeing employees not he helpful when all they're doing is standing around with nothing better to do really irritates me. The second time was a regular visit. Nothing spectacular although our waiter again kept disappearing and took his sweet time it was nothing compared to the first time.  This place seems to have a 20 minute wait for everything. I can understand a busy restaurant but when you're just lazy, no excuse. The Roseville RR is always packed and they are always super quick at getting your food to you promptly and great on check ups.  ...I still never got my ranch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln?start=140

After being seated in a giant high booth when asking for a table the hostess realized that the high chair isn't tall enough for the tables so moved us. Than waited another 15 minutes for someone even came and took a drink order. 10 more minutes and out drinks show up, dropped off by someone other than our server. 10 more minutes pass and we finally get to order. out friend orders  a vanilla milk shake with his order.20 minutes later shake shows up. 25 minutes after that out food shows up, yet we have no silver wear which we ask our server for. granted our food order was easy 2 salads some soup and mac and cheese one burger. 10 more minutes of food getting cold we have to stop another employee who has silver wear in  his hand if e can have that. so already not going well on this trip. Well when time to pony up for the bill friend and I decide to split the check, we got the two checks and put our cads in. 10 minutes later he comes back drop off the two recipes for us to sign. Well looking I see that it isn't my check and belongs to someone else. I let a server know. !0 minutes later  my check shows up minus my credit card. I sign the check and such and let them know that my credit card isn't there. the server gets an OH  fck look on his face.10 more minutes of us seeing htem franticly search. than a manager comes and sits down with us letting us know our server  might have put my credit card into someone else's check and that he believes they walked out with it. my face OH Fck. yah had to cancel my credit card and needless to say this the last time I ever at at red robin.

Our server said the bar was backed up, but it was a slow Tuesday night. It also took probably another 15 minutes to get more fries, twice.  I could have picked up fries at McDonalds and drove back in less time.   2. The service was poor.  The hostess was chatting with another worker. As we walked in she asked ""How many?"" then noticed that she had been ignoring this woman who had been standing there and came in before us.  Awkward moment.  When the waiter told us the bar was backed up, he disappeared, and didn't offer or just bring water over.  We got the water with the drinks.  When my friend asked for more fries again, the waiter came back about 10 minutes later and asked if anyone had gotten the fries for him.  They hadn't.      3. They have a $5 margarita that is about 8oz.  Maybe 10oz at most?  I've never seen a margarita that small.  Most places serve at least a 12oz to 16oz margarita for $5-$7, and this was supposed to be part of their 'happy hour' specials.  It was in a small cocktail glass.  The margarita was blended, and someone dropped it off without a straw, which the waiter saw and corrected.  I asked him if they had made a mistake on the size of the margarita.  He said that's the normal size.   I can't say I'd suggest this place until the service improves.  They also need to either make bigger margaritas or charge less for them.  The food was fine, good fries, decent burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln?start=120

Christine R.,"Elk Grove, CA",8,32,2,2.0,12/10/2014,Went here for lunch today after golfing. There was a group of 4 of us. We usually go to the one in elk grove since that's where we live. We know what to expect and this was FAR from it. We sat there for about 15 minutes. We saw one waitress and one waiter in our area but they were going to other tables and ignoring us. The hostess came to the bar area and we asked when we were going to get drinks and she pointed to the male waiter and said he would be over in just a minute. After another 5 minutes the bartender came over and took our drink and food order and apologised to us. We obviously were not her responsibility since she was the only one trending the bar. Either this place is way sorry staffed or the wait staff just doesn't care. We will stick with the elk grove location and never go to this one again. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because the bartender was caring enough to at least acknowledge us. Shame on the other staff!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincoln?start=120
