Matthew K.,"Lincoln Square, Chicago, IL",11,60,106,4.0,11/21/2017,"Have to give them props. They delivered as promised. Literally. I used the curbside take away (or whatever they call it) and the order was quickly brought to my car. I signed up for their rewards club so the burger & fries were free for my birthday. I wasn't expecting much since my last memory here was of overworked and over cooked burgers. This was a pleasant surprise. While the only options for the burger were pink or no pink, the person answering the phone let me know they would do the best to make it as close to medium rare as possible. I ended up with a juicy, pink in the middle patty. I went with the A-1 burger. It included bacon, pepper-jack, A1, lettuce, tomatoes and onion straws. The onion straws were pretty sparse although they would've been great as an appetizer. A little issue with the menu description, the crispy onion straws were relatively soggy. The applewood smoked bacon just tasted like regular bacon. I guess since you eat with your eyes first, this was the way you could picture what you're eating by reading an in depth description first. Speaking of in depth, I didn't think I had it in me to write so much about Red Robin. I'll get back there sooner than later, after this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire
Kathy K.,"Libertyville, IL",635,117,132,3.0,12/9/2017,"This is your average burger chain with average food and average service. We arrived and were told there'd be a 15-minute wait. No problem. We were seated at a booth, which I don't recommend if you are shorter than 5'3. The table top was too high and made eating awkward. I'm an adult. So don't want to feel like a child at the grown-up table! We sat down and having waited tables and hosted it was clear the section was slammed. Sure enough a different served came by and told us she was stepping in.  The food was fine so if you're looking for a bite to eat before catching a movie and have more time than required at Chipotle but less time than Big Bowl this is a good spot.  Oh, the bottomless fries is the best thing going for this chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire

Nobody ever came to our table I asked to servers who our server was somebody finally came and took our drink orders. They are known for their burgers? My daughter orderd hers medium rare,, my dad ordered his medium well, the server said that that they will be the same they only do Burgers two ways no pink or some pink. What?? Then we waited 35 minutes for our food the restaurant was never busy they were never on a wait and there were always empty tables. there were eleven of us 8 people got their food and three people didn't we finally got it and they messed it up.

Sherwin C.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",535,926,13524,3.0,2/20/2017,"The Red Robin experience I had is pretty similar to the other locations I've tried -- where the food is actually a little bit better than the typical burger and bar -- however the service is slow enough where you don't get drink refills or missing sides in a timely manner, although the main order is generally served at a reasonable time where the food is still hot. As usual, the burgers, the fried food, the shakes, and the lemonades are the best items to go for and the prices are reasonable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire
Eric E.,"Des Plaines, IL",10,235,11,4.0,5/1/2017,"Great place for burgers, and typically for an enthusiastic service. This night, however, we had a very flat greeting. Our greeter was tending to cleaning the entrance / game area, which is great, but then he needed to speak up and light up a little. He said something and promptly came over, grabbed some menus, and asked if we wanted to have a cocktail. This location had remodeled since we were last here, and the regular restaurant seemed more inviting. Until he asked about the cocktails, we didn't understand a word he said since he spoke so quietly and mumbled. Our table was clean and well lit - maybe a bit harsh as the bulb was actually pointing at my face. Not too bad if I looked down, just a little on the bright side. Our server was good, but again lacking some of the enthusiasm he showed another table, where he may have known people. Service was otherwise solid, and he did all the right things in making sure we had what we needed. The food was very good! We tried an onion stack, which was tasty, if not particularly healthy. ;-) We ordered and split a California Chicken Sandwich, which was very good! We ordered the sweet potato fries for a side, and they were maybe decent. A little soggy, but otherwise pretty good. Red Robin is a fun place to come for some fun burgers, and mostly upbeat service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire
Stan K.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",186,43,61,3.0,3/22/2017,"Always a great choice for a delicious burger and some good ole' bottomless fries. They aren't the highest quality when it comes to burgers but they are good, quick and tasty. Lots of great appetizers and soups to pair with your dinner (personal recommendation would be the chicken tortilla soup). Cool feature they recently added was the ability to pay directly at the table at a little machine and then you're good to go. We ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and the smoky jack tavern double. Chicken sandwich was good, prepared fresh and didn't taste like something deep fried. The smoky jack was good for any bbq lover with a little kick.  Here is the reason for the 2 lost stars: 1) The service was mediocre and I didn't feel like she checked up on us more than once when we originally got our food. Normally this isn't something I would pay attention to but RR offers bottomless fries and I didn't even have a chance to get a refill. 2) I honestly feel like their prices are a little high for a fast food franchise and for their level of quality. My burger was $7 but was literally child sized. The other burgers that were ""bigger"" are the ones that start at $13.  I come here once a year at most and I don't see that frequency increasing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire
Doug C.,"Deerfield, IL",9,39,48,5.0,2/2/2017,"Red Robin returns to go-to status in my world-o-food!  Because life is uncertain, I often eat dessert first and ""Chocolate Fruffles"" fit the hand like French fries and disappear just as fast...or did from my plate anyway. They're essentially dark chocolate brownies and come with a raspberry dipping sauce. Sadly, while fries at RR are bottomless, Fruffles are not. They should be. Management--make it so! Also worth a mention is the chili con-queso appetizer and the variety of burgers (tho I can't wrap my tongue around the idea of  topping a burger with an egg, friends tell me the combination is quite good). The exception, and a waste of money in my opinion, are the couldn't-be-blander cheese fries. Another hint to management: scrap the cheap Velveeta topping and use the con-queso instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire
Mike A.,"Chicago, IL",41,697,246,4.0,8/2/2016,"I love the burgers here and even though they have recently cut back on the sizes of their offerings: I am guessing about 1-2 ozs smaller than before; they are my favorite amongst the chains.  Again, while the patty is a bit smaller and not as filling; I assume rising costs drove the decision.  I would have preferred they jack up the price slightly, but oh well. New options are specialty fries: my son gets the sweet potato(big spender that kid with my $) and I get the garlic fries. Actually, every time I order the garlic fries, I get served the reg fries and they have to bring the correct order later.  My only assumption here is that there is a disconnect between the system used by waiters and the order print out in the kitchen.  The wait staff took the order down properly each time. In addition to burgers, the family also enjoys the sandwich and soup combos, as well as the app selection. Plenty of parking in the lot. Its not the cheapest and not on par with ""gourmet"" burger offerings at pubs and such; but for a chain; this place kicks the crap out of Friday's, Chillis and even fast food spots like Five Guys, Smash,etc.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire
Aleks M.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",0,1,,1.0,10/12/2017,"THIS IS THE WORST RED ROBIN. Absolutely worst customer service. We were not greeted, the servers look miserable and the manager was disgustingly rude, you can't miss her, she takes up half the restaurant and probably the reason why you get half the basket of fries that you order. Whatever you do stay away from the server Chelsea, she's got a bad attitude, and you will not enjoy your meal after having to look at her face. She looks like she took the crayons from the kids menu and drew in her eyebrows before her shift. Overall good chicken tenders but everything else is horrible.

Brian W.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,1,2,2.0,8/9/2017,"Burgers ok.  Sweet potato fries and onion rings not so much.  Over done and very stale oil, not filtered or changed in a long time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire
Alex R.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",38,7,4,1.0,6/18/2017,"I used to really enjoy going to this place. Since I have not been there for a while I was somewhat happy to go there for nieces birthday. However, my happiness turned into vapor really fast. To start off, 22 ounce beer was super flat. No problem, I was offered another by justifying that they do not sell too much of the first one.  Next, margarita drinks that other people ordered were hit or miss. Some had tequila some seemed to have mostly cheap mix. However, all were priced the same at $9.99, and thus required more to be purchased.  25 minutes later appetizers came out. Boneless wings tasted more like chickenless cardboard chunks covered in BBQ sauce to fool customers into thinking that they are real. Well, truth be told, Wendy's chickenless cardboard chunks do a much better job pretending to be boneless chicken wings. What idiot came up with boneless chicken wing concept. Are we this lazy? I digress.  Dip was just a dip, onion rings were almost like chickenless cardboard chunks but in a shape of a donut. Plates were wet, service was good as long as one of the guests constantly had to pass or receive plates of food or dirty dishes.  Best part... while ordering a gourmet burger I decided to go with. BLACK AND BLEU burger. I don't much like BLEU cheese but the picture looked soooooo good I decided to give it a go. Kind of excited to go out of my comfort box. Asked the waitress to make sure that my medium rare choice would not result in a bottom bun being totally soaked and wet, she ensured me that it won't be. In addition I was recommended to get French Onion soup as a side.  50 minutes later food comes out. My plate was handed to me so I can put it in front of me. As I took the plate I immediately noticed that my rectangle shaped plate had a burger on a left side and without any dividers had French Onion soup on the right side. Now if the soup plate was of a regular soup plate design things may have been ok, however, it was a plate designed for a cat or soy souce. It was less than a inch deep and my French Onion soup could not be contained. It was all over my plate. Naturally the bottom bun was soaked. In addition to that there was hardly any BLEU cheese on it. HARDLY!!! 3 crumbs. 3 freaking crumbs. What's the point of calling it BLACK and BLEU??? Call it a burger that looks nice on picture but like every other burger when served. Sad. Really sad. But I do have to ask, what C suite idiot decided to make soup plates less that inch deep. Does he enjoy looking a customer who struggle to fit a spoon into the plate, does he enjoy pretending that they are little kittens and need to use their tongues? Or does he think all the employees are robots who can control all their movements while bringing food to the tables? I think maybe he or she is trying to find a true America's Got Talent contestant because that is some crazy choice of plate and any person how has to serve it or a person who has to eat from it, knows it.  Hey Red Robin, it looks like your new menu and horrible food resembles your new management and decision makers. Do everyone a favor and go back to how you used to be, a place that had great food, truly GOURMET BURGERS, great service and more simplicity. IF YOU NEED HELP, REACH OUT TO ME AND I WILL GLADLY ASSIST.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire
Monty W.,"Northbrook, IL",70,241,1260,3.0,2/13/2016,"Red robin is a franchise known for their burgers, but their fried chicken sandwiches are good too. I used to love the build your own option, but they no longer offer (probably becuase it causes too many headaches for the kitchen).  Bottomless fries is an awesome offering, as I just ask for them right when I sit down as I decide on burgers.   Something that confuses me is why they have a gourmet burger section and a tavern burger section.   I don't understand the difference.   I had the big pig out which is a burger with american cheese tomato and lettuce, onion and bacon.  I had it medium rare, but it was quite interesting on how the Patty came out.   As I took a bite, it was medium, then as I finished the burger the patty was near rare.  So was the burger not on the griddle entirely?     Red Robin is a known commodity, focus on the burgers and I can't help but be tempted by the mass market beer pairings suggested for many of the burgers.   (Don't really need to get an explanation of what Coors, Bud or Miller tastes like.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire

Plenty of parking, nice service, clean and quick. Of course the food is oyur standard flair. Burgers. I had the salmon burger---salmon was a tad on the dry side but I get it....salmon is either under or over...rarely perfect. I think it's the buns that bother me the most. Not THOSE buns!! But the sandwich/burger buns are so huge and overwhelming that you are eating bread for four in one burger or sandwich. I know it cant be changed cause its a chain bla bla bla corporate bla bla bla.

Prabodh M.,"Wheeling, IL",21,36,20,4.0,3/3/2017,"I am a fan of Red Robin. I have visited their restaurants in Richmond, VA a bunch of times, but this was my first time here. We (me and my wife) went for an early dinner on Thursday evening. The place was not too busy.  The server was nice and welcoming. With both of us being vegetarian, we always have a few questions to the server. He was patient in answering them.  We ordered Burning Love (my fav) and Fiery Ghost Tavern Double, both with gardenburger patty. The fiery ghost was a little extra spicy than the burning love. Both of them were awesome. We are definitely going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire
Claire O.,"Lake Bluff, IL",13,139,1,1.0,8/12/2017,"UPDATE (8/15/17): Upon contacting Red Robin, they have made note of the problem within their management and sent me a $10 e-gift card. I sure hope some action is taken. There was no excuse for this situation. Service tonight was completely unacceptable! My boyfriend and I came in to the Lincolnshire location around 8:30pm and sat in one of the booths along the west wall sort of behind the bar area (check your in house schedule for the male server that was there at this particular time in this location). It was reasonably busy but not overwhelming. We waited a very long time to even be acknowledged. My boyfriend was contemplating ordering a milkshake and our server barked at him and said that he would come back once he ""made up his mind"" about a milkshake. He decided to pass because the server was being so rude. We ordered a crispy chicken salad, a bacon cheeseburger, and an order of the Chili Chili Cheese Fries. After our order was finally taken, our server returned with 2 small appetizer plates. Both plates were FILTHY!!! One had some orange sauce (buffalo??) on it and the other had some white stuff (ranch??) on it. I flagged our server down and asked for some clean plates because these were so dirty. When he returned, the one plate still had orange sauce on it. What did you do, just blow on them and bring them back to us??? I pushed the plates off to the side because I couldn't trust that they were clean. Chili cheese fries without a plate is not a pleasant experience. There is a serious issue here with sanitation, staff manners, and proper staff training. Someone needs to go back and review the basics! I will be contacting Red Robin regarding this matter! I hope someone from their management sees this Yelp review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire

Richard B.,"Skokie, IL",16,133,1,3.0,8/17/2013,"Why would two cold sober adults visit Red Robin for lunch?  Because we are cheapskates, and proud of it. Both my wife and I belong to the Red Robin Royalty Card Program.  It's an Internet based service that offers members free or discounted entrees.  Both my wife and I happen to be members, and each of us has a birth date in August - so voila!  The Royalty Card Program offered each of us a free hangerber (note the sophisticated spelling) for each of us. We had our adult daughter who lives out of town with us, and she willingly volunteered to pay for our sandwiches.  The apple does not fall far from the tree!  AND her first name is ""Robin.""  Really! We visited mid-day on a Saturday, and found this Red Robin to be relatively sedate and not very busy.  No screaming kids nor any screaming adults. We were seated immediately, and our server was very polite and professional.  The menu is somewhat limited to everyday fare that would appeal more to the young than connoisseurs.   I ordered a plain ""hangerber"" with mushrooms and my wife ordered some weird Jack Daniels burger concoction.  Robin (not the red one) ordered a sandwich wrap. The entrees were served promptly and correctly.  I found the hamburger to be fine - and a great value for what we spent.  My sophisticated gourmand wife snarfed down her sandwich and requested a free refill on her fries.  I, the man-about-town, swiped half of her fries when she was distracted.  There was nothing wrong with the way the food was prepared or presented. As I mentioned before, our waiter was very efficient and he kept us plied with soda pop until my bladder decided to cause me distress.  And I must add that they maintain their rest rooms very nicely. In summary, this is really a family restaurant focused more on kids than adults (although they do serve alcoholic beverages), and I cannot give it a top rating.  It is not a good choice for people who have high cholesterol levels or other health-related issues, and there is little creativeness in their offerings.  If I were rating this as a place for kids or teens, I'd give it another star in the Yelp rating system.   PS:  Robin paid for our meal, and I paid the tip.  Who got the better deal?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire?start=60

Vanessa L.,"Lake Zurich, IL",10,2,1,1.0,3/18/2016,"My experience here today was nothing short of disgusting! First I had a very sweaty waiter that was either having an anxiety attack or was on cocaine because he was talking very very fast and running around like a chicken with its head cut off! And to give him credit, I looked around to see if he was the only waiter there but it was fully staffed and not that busy. We were right near the waiters station and cut him wiping his sweat off of his face with his hand and then preparing drinks! Gross! After I got my meal I was really disappointed to find that my veggie burger was almost non-existent. It was so thin that when I took a bite it was lost between the bread lettuce tomatoes and pickles. And I also splurged and ordered the garlic fries which were so completely soaked in oil that they were nearly inedible. You'd think this would be the worst that would happen , however in the middle of eating this guy comes over and says he's in the process of becoming the new manager and wants to see how it's going at our table. He asked us if we loved it or just liked it. Weird. Then he tells us he's asking because he's not sure whether he wants to take the job or not! Weird!

While the place clearly had a drastic makeover, and looks lovely - the food quality has drastically declined. In addition, I was horrified at how expensive a dinner for me and my son was. High-to-Mid $30's when all was said and done - for horrible food.  Our waiter was lovely. Young guy, very nice. No issues on the service part.  I ordered what sounded tastefully tantalizing - Garlic Herb fries!! OMG doesn't it sound delightful?! Yeah, that's not what i got. What i got was dead french fries, with a HORRIBLE sprinkling of garlic powder. And they weren't even warm. They were like cardboard sprinkled with super cheap prison garlic powder. (Not that I know what prison garlic powder tastes like). They sounded so fancy and yummy on the menu - I was envisioning chunks of actual garlic, and green herbs, and other seasonings..... Nope.  I also had ordered a side of broccoli, and specifically requested that it be cooked extra-long so that it was soft. Once again - NOT what I got. I got *barely* cooked, almost raw, broccoli. With NOTHING on it. No butter, no salt - nothing. When I asked the waiter about it, he said they heat it in a microwave. And actually, upon clearing the table and noticing that i didn't take more than ONE bite of said nasty broccoli (which i promptly spit out), you'd think he would've offered to take it off the bill or something. But no.  The only thing that was somewhat decent was the burger. But they can't even cook it to order! I enjoy mine Medium Rare, and my son enjoys his still moo-ing (RARE), but they said they can only cook it Medium Well, so there's no pink left.  So we had two burgers, both with fries, a side of broccoli, and 2 drinks. Nearly $40.  Needless to say, I will NOT be back. Somewhere along the line, this restaurant lost it's way. Sad, because the new renovation makes the place *look* much nicer and up to date!  Laterz Red Robin. You won't be wasting any more of my money.

Diana L.,"Chicago, IL",14,111,119,3.0,12/30/2014,"The food is fantastic but the service is questionable/poor, which really hurts the rating. I came here twice and while the endless fries and burgers are wonderful, the servers seem scatterbrained and ditzy. The first time, the waitress seemed to be in a bad mood and didn't really check on the table and seemed stingy with getting more fries. I couldn't get a water refill because she simply forgot about my table the entire time. It was nearing closing time so perhaps she wanted to leave asap, but it's still rude. The second time, I came again because I really enjoyed the food and I wanted to show my relatives. However, the waitress forgot to give our table silverware and napkins. Even after she brought our food, she still didn't bring us utensils. I had to grab another waitress who gave me a handful of napkins and one knife and one fork...for a party of six. Sharing is caring, I guess? (Fyi, the first time I came, I got utensils and plus all the other diners had utensils, so why did this happen?) Once again, she stopped by once to ask about the food and that was it. No water refills or anything until it was time to bring the check. My dad ended up pouring my mom's water into his cup so he could get something to drink. For fries, I had to ask another waitress to find her and get her to bring more. My table really enjoyed the fries, but they came out so slowly. In addition, our ketchup bottles were empty and I had to awkwardly take others from another table and remind the waitress to fill them up. Food-wise though - I can't get enough of the burgers! The numerous combinations are very fun to try and share. My prime chophouse burger was cooked to perfection (medium rare) and exactly as the menu described. This isn't misleading like McDonald's - the burgers are packed and huge! Although my second visit's burger wasn't as good. I had the mushroom and swiss burger. I told the waitress medium rare and she sounded confused about what that meant because it came out well-done (and with a burnt charcoal aftertaste) even though I requested it to be a little pink.  The seasoning for the fries is awesome! I wish I could buy a bottle to keep at home! I like taking advantage of the unlimited fries because I like sprinkling the seasoning on top. The fries come piping hot and have that perfect crunchy on the outside, soft inside texture. I had two children who got kids meals - if you get the Rad Robin burgers, ask if the kitchen if you can add cheese, lettuce, and tomato because otherwise, all you get is a plain burger. This is disappointing for the kids who watch their parents eat giant, fancy burgers. (Unless of course, the waitress forgot to mention we had the option for toppings, I assume you just get a plain burger.)

Ed F.,"Mundelein, IL",0,185,2,1.0,1/25/2016,"Red Robin used to be our go-to place for a good burger, at a reasonable price, in a comfortable atmostphere (VERY kid-friendly place). Can't say the burger is all that good anymore - smaller size, no longer wrapped (much harder to eat), and they just can't seem to get the doneness right - over cooked or undercooked. As others have noted, most everything has changed - instead of making small changes, they've just changed everything.  I'm all for change, but if something works, tweak the little things.  The presentation is upscale, but why?  It's a burger and fries.  Oh yea, bottomless just means they bring you half the amount that they used to, and you have to keep asking for more (with refills much smaller as well). Someone has to pay for all those changes, so now the prices have increased - it's now $10 for the standard Red Robin cheeseburger (with the paltry sleeve of fries).

I would come here with my friends, my parents, my husband and have never had a bad experience here. Service is always top notch. More specifically, I came here yesterday and I got the crispy chicken sandwich which was so fresh full of veggies and the bun was super soft just the way I like it and the meat was oh so tender. I gobbled (thanksgiving weekend) down the entire thing. My husband had the regular cheeseburger and also really enjoyed it. Everything we've had from burgers, to wraps (my husband loves the bbq chicken wrap) soups, salads, mile high pie (oh soo good, especially during my stressful college nights) everything tastes great. Now the best part of Red Robin has to be the bottomless steak fries with their own honey mustard dressing. I could drink that dressing it is that good, and nowadays you can request the fries extra crispy and they even added sweet potato fries to their menu. That makes the whole experience that much sweeter. I can eat a whole basket by myself, but shh, you didn't hear that from me.

Ralph E.,"Deerfield, IL",0,8,,3.0,1/12/2016,"Good burgers, pretty good service, but unreasonable prices. That's how I'd sum up our recent ""night out"" at Red Robin, which as usual was very busy so we had to sit in the bar. That ended up being a good call, because the main dining room was stuffed with large families, parties and children and the noise was incredible. That noise was the reason we had avoided this restaurant for 15 years! But the bar is very hospitable for adults, has nice comfortable seating (high-tops); unfortunately the lighting is much too bright for it to be ""clubby"" or ""intimate,"" or it would be just right. The burger selection is inventive, but for $13 to 15 I expect a hefty beef patty, a very substantial bakery-quality bun and very generous toppings. Instead, you get what resembles a McD Quarter Pounder (although more flavorful and pink in the middle), sitting on a squishy bun. Barely better than a fast-food bun. If the heel (bottom half) of the bun is only a quarter-inch thick after the burger has sat for a few minutes, you are not eating a good quality bun. PERIOD. I think a $13-14 burger had better be the biggest, best damn burger you've eaten all month, or, it should be at really great restaurant where you are paying for premium atmosphere and service, not Red Robin. When I asked about some of the ""fun"" dipping sauces for fries, our server pointed out that some were added cost items. The list of added cost items on the sides menu is also long; extra for onion rings, extra for sweet potatoes, etc. This all just makes the owner look cheap. We paid about $40 for two people, two burgers, one beer and no extras of any kind except sweet potato fries for one of us.

Lots of their burgers look interesting and they'll substitute a boca patty into anything. They'll also happily omit the bun if you have to eat gluten-free. The last time we went our waiter was wonderful and bent over backwards to make sure everything was safe and gluten-free. He was so eager to make sure the seasoning on the onion rings was safe that he completely overlooked that their onion rings are breaded and not gluten-free anyway. :) The manager apparently personally oversaw the cooking process of my mother's meal and micromanaged the fries in particular to make sure they were safe.  I want to like their food. I really do. There are lots of things on the menu I'd like to try.

Don't ask it to be more than that and you'll not be disappointed. I had the A1 Peppercorn burger, which was really quite tasty- it had onion strings and a peppercorn sauce on it, and the cooks nailed medium as I'd requested it, so I was happy. My princess had the big kahuna burger, which has, among other things, teriyaki sauce and pineapple on it. Yeah, it's weird as hell, but it works... it was pretty good! The fries, which are bottomless, were a little iffy. No, I'll not be having seconds... wouldn't have wanted them anyway. They tasted as though older grease was used... ugh. The decor is upbeat, it's a fun place, and the staff at least seems to be enjoying themselves. The food prices seem a little bit high; they're probably insulating themselves from people who get 4 baskets of fries just because they can.  Halfway decent beer selection with about 6 on draft and several others by the bottle. My princess ordered a seasonal drink called Sand in Your Shorts, which according to the menu, is ""more comfortable than it sounds."" It came out with a giant slice of orange, a maraschino cherry, and a paper umbrella in a 22 ounce glass and reminded me of the giant drink they served Stryker in the first Airplane movie, but it was pretty good.

Ramona T.,"Mundelein, IL",0,1,,2.0,8/30/2017,"I usually eat in so this was my first experience with pickup and my last at Red Robin.  The ""hostess"" was not trained so could not give out pick-up orders and the pickup desk was not attended so had to wait for a very much over-worked bartender to get a pick-up order.  I had to wait as she made drinks, waited on tables, delivered orders and bills to tables.  14 minutes passed before I was waited on, I was then informed my order that was in the process of bagging which took another 10 minutes.  My order was finally in my hands 25 minutes after my pick up time on my email receipt.  Had the food been hot, that would have been somewhat ok, but my burger and fries were ice cold.  No napkin, no ketchup, no explanation except that because it was a web order the staff is not sure about when it should have been ready.   NEVER AGAIN",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire?start=20

Scott W.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",0,2,,2.0,8/9/2017,"When your server greets you by telling you she's training someone you kind of think she making a pre-excuse for giving you lousy service.  Sure enough the service was lousy.  We sat in the bar and got our onion rings before we got any drinks.  We were finally able to flag down our server, who seemed more interested in chatting up other customers, and she finally brought us drinks.  Halfway through the onion rings the burgers came out.  The food was decent but the service was poor, which was unusual.  Had to chase down server for  a refill and never got asked if we wanted more 'bottomless' fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire?start=20
Susan S.,"Vernon Hills, IL",121,381,2251,2.0,6/17/2015,Had my red robin burger. Bacon and eggs on top. Burger came out Luke warm with cold fries . Asked for hot fries by the time they came I was a third done with my burger. Our waitress was not very good and on the rude side . Was disappointed with the temperature and service. Taste was good . But not a fan of tepid food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire?start=20
Carmen A.,"Chicago, IL",21,9,2,1.0,6/3/2017,"This is my go to Red Robin, has been for some time. The service has totally gone downhill from what I remember. There is no organization. Walked in, lobby quite busy. There is  a host writing names in a receipt with 3 tablets next to her, some girl and guy just standing right behind her. The host took our name down and strictly told the girl my group was ahead of another group of 3. The host walked away to make sure a large rsvp table was ready. The girl grabbed menus and sat the family the host told her were after my party. When the host got back she noticed and said there was nothing she could do and to take a seat the wait would be approximately 45 mins. I told her the other girl sat the family after us before us and the girl who sat the family rolled her eyes at me and said they were getting drinks. They would have sat at the bar which does not require to be seated. I was not going to wait 45mins to see others being seated before me as I was there first.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire?start=20
Jay K.,"Northbrook, IL",107,454,597,4.0,1/17/2016,"I've only been here once but based on that one visit I'll be back. After reading in the Tribune that they made some big changes we decided to check it out. We were very pleased. True to the article the bar area is completely separate from the main dining area. This works for me since I'm not really into the family dining scene when I'm watching football and chowing down on a burger. About that burger, it was really good. Perfectly cooked to medium the way I ordered it. I like the bottomless sides and the choices. I had broccoli and my wife had fries. The server asked us a couple of times if we wanted more. Nice touch. I also had a blue cheese bacon salad wedge thing that was only three bucks! They have decent selection of draft beers (Fat Tire for me) and bottled beer too. We had excellent service and excellent food. Great place to go to before or after a movie which is across the parking lot. If my future visits are as good as this one I'll up my rating to five stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire?start=20
Jesus G.,"Chicago, IL",132,237,125,4.0,7/9/2015,"I was just there last week and was surprised that the entire place was recently remodeled!! Now I felt like it wasn't as ""kid"" friendly and felt more like a lounge/bar. The burger selection is good (more gourmet burgers now) and I have never had a bad experience there with the staff. The bottomless fries also add up to the experience since I do love their steak fries with the RR seasoning and now the freckled lemonade is also bottomless! They always have burger promotions going on where if you get a certain burger you can get tickets to a specific movie at the Regal cinema across the street.... this would be cool if I lived in the area and was interested in the specific movie.  I actually want to go back for their happy hour menu to sit in the patio and enjoy a few beers. I would report back on their happy hour menu and ambiance since I have only been there for lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire?start=20
Tami L.,"Lake Forest, IL",24,4,,4.0,9/24/2017,"Shout out to this Red Robin's friendly staff, mgr. Alec and Bartender ""De'Anne"" ( My apology if I have misspelled your name...).  I am vegan and took their suggestion to try Red Robin's brand new veggie patty.  Their grilled Boca Burger is being phased out and the previous vegetarian burger won't work for vegan palettes.    Alec readily ran into the kitchen to snap a picture of the label, then showed the ingredients list to me before I decided.  It comes on your choice of two breads, or in a lettuce wrap with a handy paper holder.  I ordered the lettuce wrap with extra avocado and asked the kitchen to omit the add on melted cheese (of course) the fried mushroom crisps, topping.  Additionally I asked for them to  microwave my patty rather than grill it with the meat burgers.  It was great!   I think children would like it also.   The new patty has a slight southwest favor without any spicy hot pepper flavoring.    You could probably add that yourself.  I have always been able to create vegan meals at Red Robin.  Healthy vegan options include sliced avocado, vegan black beans and steamed broccoli sides.  Double them or add to a salad and indulge in endless sweet potato (or regular) fries.  Thanks to Alec and De'Anne for their extra help and great service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire?start=20
Betty L.,"Minato, Japan",139,147,254,4.0,3/4/2016,You can't go wrong with the Royal Red Robin burger which was cooked at a perfect medium as requested. The egg and bacon paired perfectly and tasted so good! I got the sweet potato fries (for an additional $1.50) which were delicious and had a great texture to them. I don't know what he was thinking but my co-worker ordered the fish and chips. Red Robin is known for their burgers and that's it. The fish was overly fried and had no flavor to it at all. He got the garlic fries (for an additional $1.50) to go with it and it was just their regular steak fries (which are really bland and dry) with some weird garlic topping on it. I didn't think they were good at all. Definitely stick with the sweet potato fries.  Our waitress was really friendly and came around often to check on us (maybe one too many times). But she was really attentive and brought us fries to start and our food as soon as it was ready. The restaurant was remodeled but the layout is pretty much the same with plenty of tables and booths. They have these spiffy new tablets on the table where you can pay your bill whenever you're ready which is very convenient.  Our bill averaged about $20 per person which is average for gourmet burgers and upgraded fries. Overall it's a nice place for group lunches or dinners. Also not a bad place for a casual date.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire?start=20
Vaishnavi S.,"Vernon Hills, IL",38,78,77,4.0,12/10/2015,"Any time we are in the mood for a good burger, Red Robin is the place!  We have been to this location on quite a few occasions, service has been good every single time. I especially recount the time when we walked in 10mins before closing, yet they politely accommodated us. Our favorites include Burning Love, Whiskey River BBQ and Bruschetta Chicken. The good part about Red Robin is that you can choose any burger and they will swap the meat for a veggie patty. Not a place for the calorie conscious - their milkshakes & bottomless fries are a must have. A tip :: I personally like my burgers with a fried egg and prefer swapping regular fries with sweet potato for a dollar extra. Like most of their locations, this one too doesn't disappoint on taste, ambience & service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire?start=20
Judy L.,"Deerfield, IL",0,42,,2.0,10/20/2016,I've been going to this red Robin for years and it seems like it used to be better. When you ask for a second order of fries it takes like 10 minutes for them to bring them out. It seems like they're getting stingy with bringing you seconds on the french fries and then by the time you get them you don't even want them. $80 is what we paid for 4 burgers and basic drinks! Oh we did get one kids meal and a short order of onion rings too but it was so expensive we don't want to go back for a long time.When we went it was a Wednesday night in the place was practically empty. The food was OK but it just doesn't seem worth it anymore. I choose the salad is my side and it was OK at least it was better than the broccoli which is like rubber and just awful. My granddaughter enjoyed her macaroni and cheese kids meal though. It's just a little bit too high-priced now so we will be going less.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire?start=20
