Lenny Z.,"Sebastopol, CA",0,35,3,5.0,10/4/2017,"OK, disclaimer: I'm a fried chicken sandwich guy.  If I haven't been to your establishment yet, I'm going to order a classic fried chicken sandwich, and I'm going to judge your entire business based on that sandwich.  So guess what Round Robin? You got five stars! That was the best fried chicken sandwich I can remember having in recent memory. I wish there was a round robin in my hometown. I will be back next time I'm in Denver Tech Center!  The staff was quite friendly too :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lone-tree
Chris P.,"Highlands Ranch, CO",44,68,7,2.0,8/12/2017,"It hurts me to give Red Robin only 2 stars as I've generally been a fan but I was not impressed.  They started out by taking way too long to get us a table.  It's a Friday night and there were plenty of open tables but the hostesses were more consumed with chit chatting with each other.  It was rather obvious they were in no rush.  Next was the rather slow service.  I'd say they need more waiters.   A good portion of their menu is various forms of hamburgers.  I'd say this seems to be their ""specialty""  The pictures on their menu have these huge juicy patties.  I ordered their Spicy Siracha burger...with some pink.  When it came it was a patty about the thickness of a McDonalds burger and was charred with no pink at all.  If burgers are your specialty, then please learn how to cook them and don't skimp on the meat.   It seems to me that Red Robin has a big name and a pretty good reputation.  Seems like they're happy enough with that and don't worry about the little things like service and quality of food.  Too bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lone-tree
Shelby M.,"Aurora, CO",17,101,80,5.0,12/12/2017,"I love Red Robin and this one is one of the better ones to go to. They are always so nice here and they check on you all the time to make sure you are doing alright. the server we had was so sweet and she always made sure we had a full drink and if we wanted more fries or not. they always seat you super quick to and always know what's going on in the restaurant.  I had the burger with the ghost chili sauce on it and was a little disappointed because it was not spicy at all really and if it was a ghost chili sauce then i wanted it to make me sweat, but alas it was not. It was still delicious though and this is one of my favorite chains to get a burger at. the fries here also never disappoint and are always mouthwatering good. That is one of the things I love about Red Robin, the endless fries. I also love the way they do their buns. they grill them so its crispy on the bottom and the top is nice and soft. I will definitely be coming back soon to get my fill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lone-tree
Toni R.,"Denver, CO",80,9,,1.0,1/1/2018,"I went to Red Robin today. We waited 30 minutes for french fries.

Tammie W.,"San Diego, CA",33,393,579,3.0,12/29/2016,"I usually order my meal to go since service is hit or miss but I was very pleased on my last visit.   My friends complain about the prices, but a typical burger joint will run you $10-$12 with fries and the upside to Red Robin is that the fries are bottomless and the ranch dressing runs freely throughout the restaurant.   I had the fried chicken sandwich with a sweet waffle bun which was awesome and opposite of what I usually order (fish and chips).  The chicken sandwich was topped with lettuce, tomato, a jalapeño relish and a honey glaze.  It was a perfect complement of sweet and spicy, though messy and had to be eaten with a knife and fork.   During the holidays, the gingerbread milkshake is a must!   Check them out if you're near Park Meadows and want a quick meal with the family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lone-tree

Kathie P.,"Englewood, CO",0,26,,2.0,12/6/2017,"I used to be a fan of Red Robin.  No longer.  First of all....the burgers have gotten really thin.  They used to be thicker, juicier, tastier.  They give less fries now too. But my biggest complaint is that they go to great pains to ask how you want your burger cooked. we both said medium to well, no pink please.  Both of our burger were very pink....hard to do when so thin. Must have barely touched the grill on each side.  This is the third time.  So not just a one time mistake.  We were hungry so we ate, and when the server came by when we were more than halfway done. We showed him, but since we ate half already we didn't send them back.  He came by at the end to tell us he told the cook. No comping the drinks, or offer of more fries or anything.  Just not as good as it used to be, and I resent being given a skinny burger when it used to be much thicker and juicier.  Better places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lone-tree
Madison M.,"Denver, CO",106,210,256,2.0,6/24/2017,I have never been to red Robin before but I was really wanting a burger after seeing all of their commercials on television so I decided to stop in and give them a try one afternoon. I did not realize that their entire menu is just hamburgers and sandwiches. I was expecting more options like salads and other bar type foods but I was shocked to see that it really was just burgers and sandwiches. Since I wanted a burger I was good to go and I ordered a pretty delicious burger overall it was cooked just the way I liked it and asked for and it came out in about 10 minutes. They say that they have bottomless fries but they really don't give you much to start with they only give you a small handful of french fries. So you will definitely want to be ordering more if you are a french fry fiend like I am.  The service here is all right. A lot of it has become automated with the check out right at your table so there is less interaction with your server than there is at a number of other restaurants. This has its pros and cons but I'll let you decide if that's the kind of place you want to dine at.  Overall it was an OK experience. The booths were a little bit sticky and the table had a weird patina on the top like it had just been wiped off for 15 years instead of ever properly cleaned. It was an all right burger but I don't think that's enough to bring me back to this particular red Robin. Maybe I'll give another location to try in a few years.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lone-tree
Heather M.,"Littleton, CO",53,80,21,2.0,10/19/2017,"Red Robin used to have delicious food and a fun atmosphere. Well, this is not true for this location. We were sat fairly quickly however we then had to wait about 10 minutes for some ice water. Then we asked for a glass of white zin and they say they don't have it. We order a moscotto and again they don't have it.  The drink orders took about 20 minutes and we are thankful we asked for a water! We skip the wine and now we order an appetizer of ships and salsa as we wait for the food we are ordering. After another half an hour they bring out the chips and guacamole and salsa as well as the hamburgers. We asked that the guac and chips be taken back and they comped it out( the guacamole was brown).  The manager never came to our table but did comp the salsa and give us a friend and family discount of 25%. I tipped Christina the waitress well as she tried her best, I don't feel this was her fault. It seemed to be poorly managed. The staff all seemed to be working extremely hard. We probably won't go back to this specific location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lone-tree

Ed G.,"Littleton, CO",33,179,6,2.0,10/1/2017,"Well things change and then they change back again... Decided to grab a bite at this red Robin before we caught the light rail to go see a Rockies game. We were greeted when we walked in.....well, we weren't really greeted when we walked in. The guy had his face engulfed in some menus walked us to our seats and then said someone will be with us shortly. We sat at the table for a few minutes and no waiter so we decided to move to the bar. The bartender was quick in getting us our drinks and when our appetizer came we had no silverware. I decided I would get it myself. The bartender saw me get up to go get it but also didn't say anything to me when he brought us our food. The manager also saw me going to get silverware and asked me where I was sitting. No one ever came back to check on this. I believe it all starts from management and manager was clearly aware of what was going on but chose to do nothing. My girlfriend said there's no toilet paper in the bathroom. I learned a long time ago that people go where they're invited and return where they're welcomed.

Recently we decided to try the RR location off Broadway and C-470, and our service was terrible, our burgers were raw in the middle despite the fact that we ordered them well done/no pink. It was a terrible experience. We won't be back to that location.

We didn't say ""it was her fault""....so we attempted to eat a few bites real quick and everything was cold! We asked for the manager who came out with excuses like the kitchen is short staffed. We told him the food was cold and he told us that our food was sitting in the window for awhile. Well why didn't the manager run our food out??? Not to mention where was our server?

Tyler B.,"Castle Rock, CO",40,4,,2.0,4/27/2017,This chain has gone completely down hill.  It used to be our favorite place for burgers.  The food is still decent however the service is horrendous and terribly slow.  Every time we leave we swear that we won't go back.  Two months later we will get sucked back in hoping things will change and it never does.

Glenda R.,"Ogden, UT",2,4,1,2.0,4/8/2017,"Food was decent, a typical Red Robin. The service though was terribly slow. Everyone at our table had already drank their entire beverage before we were able to place our order (except for the one child, whose drink was forgotten).

It then takes 5 mins or more to get the server's attention.  RR used to have an impressive training program, but it seems to be a reduced effort ever since their attempted rebranding strategy.

They do have those handy touch screens to check out if you're in a hurry though, I think of lot of chain sit down restaurants are starting to do this.

My strawberry lemonade wasn't good so I got a regular lemonade and that also wasn't good. They were out of TP in the bathroom stall. Everything is overpriced.

Mandy R.,"Lakewood, CO",23,167,76,2.0,3/24/2015,"My friends and I came here last Sunday for an early dinner before heading to the Pepsi Center for a concert. I hadn't been to a Red Robin in years, but I love a good burger, so I was looking forward to it. However, it seems the food has really gone downhill at Red Robin. They've (recently?) redesigned their menu and added a lot of appetizers, pared down the burgers while adding a few new ones, and kind of toned down the whole ""kiddie heaven"" vibe (fine by me!). We started with the Pretzel Bites, and well, they were quite disappointing. The bites themselves tasted like those you can buy in the freezer section and cook in your oven at home, and the beer cheese sauce? It tasted like Cheez-Whiz with some beer stirred in. Gross. I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ Burger, as I remembered liking it in the past. It was okay, but tasted like a drive thru burger. Thankfully I ordered it with a side salad because the fries I stole off of a friend's plate tasted stale and unappetizing (and they were hot, so I'm pretty sure they were ""fresh""). I only ate about 1/2 my burger and felt disappointed when I paid my bill -- $16 for a very, very mediocre burger and appetizer and a glass of water. All told, $20 with the tip for a meal that I could have gotten for $10 at a drive thru and probably would have enjoyed more. The food deserved one star, however, our server was pretty awesome. He was super friendly and attentive, plus he put up with some bad jokes from us (sorry, bud!), so he earned the extra star here. A plus for groups: this restaurant has that nifty pay-at-the-table device (I don't remember what it's called, but Chili's has something similar).

Even worse, when shown the issue (which can kill you) they offered $3 off. 3 whole dollars. I could not believe it. No, 'We are so sorry' or anything like that. Honestly, they should have comped the table. I guess since we had a large party it was just to much.  I cannot believe I ate here again. It was my nephews birthday, so that is why I went. His choice. This is supposedly the flag ship store. The corporate office is just across the highway. I know the execs come in every once in a while. They must wear big bright neon signs so they get the best service and food.  I tried the Ghost Pepper Burger. It was suppose to have deep fried and fresh peppers. Nope, not mine. No deep fried peppers. It was basically a dry burger with little flavor. Another sad attempt to make something really great.  After my last review, I was contacted by a manager of this fine establishment. I did not respond. To the manager who is reading this, please do not try and contact me. I do not want free food or coupons. All I want is for you to do better. Not just for me, but for all those unfortunate souls who stumble in to your establishment. I hope to never be back.

For some reason it's my kid's favorite place to eat so we decided to come here for lunch today.  It's really as awful as I remember. Their bottomless steak fries with ranch are really the only thing good on their menu. I've had the various burgers many times and their flavor is always just a bit off. Today I had the crispy chicken sandwich and there was absolutely nothing crispy about it. It was about the soggiest chicken I've ever had. Service was so-so, too.

Well actually some are dusty and there are tables with people eating right under them in the bar area. We had no complaints about the food.

The staff have an image to uphold, a game to play. There is like, one hamburger on the menu, made with a million different sauces. Their guac is the only thing that's good. Really, the only thing I could stomach. My salad was overdressed to the point of no return, and now that I think about it, pretty much every other time I've been here the food has also, well, sucked.

Similary to Correy H., I also have been disappointed that most of the Red Robins seem to have adopted the ""no fries before your meal"" policy (unless you pay extra).  Although I understand the logic (they are trying to sell more apps, and reduce the amount of uneaten fries), this seems like irritatingly needless penny pinching.  I am already paying over $10 for a burger and ""bottomless"" (supposedly) fries, add $3 for a soda, and we are easily into $16 (with tax and tip) land.  This assumes you did not order an appetizer, beer, milkshake, etc.  I very much prefer eating my fries piping hot as part of the communal experience before the burger arrives.  Eating my 7 (yes, I counted) cold fries after I have consumed my burger is significantly less satisfying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lone-tree?start=60

I cannot recommend that you spend your good money with this location as the manager is unable to get the kitchen to prepare what's described on the menu, and if you get the server we got, they'll challenge you for asking if they brought the right product (even when it's not), they'll forget your drinks to serve a larger, later arriving party (""I got slammed"" is what they must be taught to say, instead of I'm sorry how can I fix the situation?""), the table-top checkout device will spit out a blank receipt, and a conversation with the manager will provide only a ""That shouldn't happen"" reaction without a clue of how to deal with any issues. Sad. Very sad. What was left on the RR customer service web site today: So many things wrong its hard to know where to start. Dined tonight (July 4th) at table #93 at the Lone Tree store. Service was worse than poor and the manager had no clue how to deal with it when brought to her attention at our departure. Family of 4 dining, with father paying - and this is mostly the father's (payee's) feedback based upon his meal. Incomplete meal brought to table: Red Tavern Big Turbo brought to table as plain burger with only pepperjack cheese (no special sauce, no carmelized onions). Server challenged (clueless on how to match product to food delivered) but took it back to kitchen to fix. Brought it back out - now cold - with onions thrown on top. Also not impressed that RR charges $1.80 more for a bigger burger size when all that really happens is that a double burger becomes a thin single burger. Misleading. Server then promised to being more drinks which never happened. When this was later mentioned to him he shrugged it off saying a bigger table subsequently came in and he got slammed. No offer to take any action at all, which turns out to be the same approach his manager took when we walked to see her...after our tableside checkout terminal printed us a blank receipt (no one knows how to fix that either). Overall, RR leaves a customer with a don't give a sh&t attitude, with employees so poorly trained they cannot prepare or deliver food correctly, provide good service or deal with their own ineptitude when it arrises.

When it came out, the burger had a wheat bun on it. I told the server I couldn't have it, so she took it back to the kitchen. When it came back, I examined it and noticed there was still parts of the bun stuck to the cheese! That is just dangerous to do to people. This is the worst Red Robin I've ever been to. Not only was the service terrible, the servers were rude, the silverware was dirty, there are BUGS, and they did not respect my allergies. Never again will I go back here, especially when most burger places now are nearly the same price, with better burgers. Save yourself the trouble and disappointment and go to somewhere that makes good food and has better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lone-tree?start=80
Janice L.,"Aurora, CO",0,4,,1.0,2/4/2013,"Awful. I keep trying it because of my nephews. This place is terrible. Someone gave RED ROBIN 5 stars? Where do you normally eat, Taco Bell? If you have allergies beware of this place. They bring out a menu and say you can order from this then they put what you are allergic to ON the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lone-tree?start=80
Foodie In Boots C.,"Lone Tree, CO",0,7,5,1.0,12/12/2010,"Red Robin...YUCK  It was my first time actually eating at a red robin, and it will be the last time doing so. The atmosphere was nice, the waiters and staff were okay. But the food, the food reminded me of pre-assembled cafeteria food! I asked my server for her recommendation, since all of the burgers, chicken sandwiches and salads looked overwhelmingly tasty from all the pictures from the menu. She suggested the patty melt and raved about it, she also recommend the gingerbread milkshake. My friend, who ate with me, ordered a chicken sandwich. Upon receiving the food I thought it was a mistake, the patty melt consisted of dry, hard bread , a dry slab of meat, and two pieces of cheese that looked like Elmer's glue slapped on. I took a bite it was so dry , the fries that came with it was just the same, flavorless. The gingerbread milkshake was bland, it tasted of graham crackers mixed with vanilla.  My friend complained that her chicken sandwich was dry and tasteless. When receiving the check I thought it was too costly for this type of meal...tasteless!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lone-tree?start=80
David M.,"Denver, CO",18,6,1,1.0,3/28/2010,"I'm suspect of their beef ever since getting food poisoning from a burger that was served too rare.  I ordered a medium burger and it came very rare, so after two bites, I sent it back. The replacement burger came cook correctly and tasted fine. However, several hours later I found myself throwing up burger chunks (with no flu like symptoms, so I'm pretty certain the tainted beef was the cause). So despite the poor dining experience we had (with nothing more than an apology from the waitress -- the gesture of a free desert or taking half off my the price of my burger would have gone far in preventing me from writing this review), the place is also not exactly a cheap night out for the family. All burgers except the plain jane burger are in the $10 range. So it adds up quickly. Do yourself a favor and find a non-chain burger joint and let your $10 go a little further. Or, in a pinch, hit up Good Times which uses quality ingredients for half the price of Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lone-tree?start=80
John C.,"Sacramento, CA",20,14,6,5.0,9/23/2008,"You know back home we also have a Red Robin, so I wasn't expecting to be impressed enough to even go back to the hotel and write a review. But man the experience here really made me wonder what's wrong with our red robin back home. We had a group of 6 of us and we all got a plethora of burgers fries and onion rings (just like you would do at a Red Robin). The food was cooked just right and quickly brought out to us but that wasn't what really impressed me althought my 5-alarm burger was perfect in my opinion.I was really impressed when the bartender actually came over and talked about all the beer choices with us and made some really great recommendations based on what we were looking for. This has never happened back home so I was impressed. The real reason the place gets 5 starts is simply the staff. From the friendly hostess that greeted us when we walked in the door to our amazing waiter who was so entertaining and friendly we could have had horrible food and still had a great experience. The bartender went above and beyond making sure everyone enjoyed their drinks and was happy. I have eaten at Red Robin many time, but I have never walked out of there after having such a great time... ever. Thank you staff, you guys were simply amazing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lone-tree?start=80
Jeremiah Z.,"Denver, CO",162,173,71,3.0,12/23/2010,"I appreciate the great service they provide.  The menu is pretty predictable, 6 or 7 different hamburgers with literally only 1 or 2 different ingredients that magically turn them into an oriental, bbq, or cajun themed meat patty.  there are a few chicken versions of every burger, & a few odds & ends like mac & cheese or some asian type salad that likely came from a plastic bag stored in the cooler.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lone-tree?start=80

Andrea B.,"Wichita, KS",43,21,,4.0,10/11/2010,"I love the burgers and chicken here! Personally I like the Whiskey River Burger and the Bonsai Burger.

Beth B.,"Englewood, CO",0,1,,1.0,5/12/2012,"We usually love going to Red Robin, as it's a great place to grab a quick burger and is perfect to go with kids.  However, tonight was the worst service we've ever had!  We wanted to go to the nearby PF Chang's, but the wait was 3 hours at 5:30!  So, we headed to this Red Robin.  We could tell from the beginning that our waitress was going to be lazy, and she definitely was.  She took our order and all was good, but she was not the one to bring out our food.  It was some other guy, who asked if we needed anything else.  My father-in-law asked for a drink refill, which was never refilled, until 15 minutes later when our actual waitress came over to check on us (and give us the check).  I got the mushroom burger, which is supposed to have a parmesan spread on it, but my burger was free of any sort of spread, so it was kind of dry.  However, I didn't feel like waiting for a new burger and no one was visible to ask.  I noticed that they give you about half the normal amount of fries now, which are supposed to be bottomless.  No one asked us if anyone wanted more fries.  I drank all my tea and could have used a refill, but our waitress never came back.  Then, I went to change my baby's diaper and in the handicap stall, where the changing table is, there was no hook on the back of the door to hang my diaper bag, which was very inconvenient.  Not to mention no one bothered to clean up the bathrooms before the dinner rush, so both trashcans were overflowing paper towels onto the floor, and the counters were very wet.  Additionally, the restrooms are placed horribly.  In order to avoid walking through the servers' work station, you have to walk around the whole perimeter of the restaurant and wind your way through the tables, where there really isn't much clearance between chairs if people are sitting in them.  Then, to top off the night, we had promised our 2 year old a balloon, if she behaved herself.  She did, so on our way out, we asked for a balloon.  The high school hostess said someone was filling balloons right now and it'd be about ten minutes, if we wanted to wait!  Yeah, right!  I felt like on a Saturday night at a restaurant that's filled with children, there should be a bunch of balloons, ready to hand out.  Overall, I was just really disappointed with the service at this Red Robin!  We will be avoiding this location next time we go shopping at Park Meadows.  No wonder there was no wait for a table!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lone-tree?start=80
