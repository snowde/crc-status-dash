Suzanne P.,"Grapevine, TX",208,243,154,4.0,10/1/2017,"Sat at the bar and had burgers & beer. Bartender was fantastic! He was moving so fast taking care of everyone at the bar, in the bar area and all the to-go orders.  Had the sriracha burger w fries ($6.99) and hubby had the royal Red Robin ($10). Sriracha burger was good but no flavor of the sauce. Hubby liked his burger.  The real stand out was the bartender. If you go, sit in the bar. Great service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-longmont
Zachariah W.,"Riverview, Tampa Bay, FL",2,6,,1.0,10/11/2017,"What a poorly run business, I will first start off by saying I understand it's not there fault that this took place. It is there responsibility however to make it right. I'm currently sitting here trying to enjoy dinner with my wife after work and she orders a root beer float. When she lifts the drink off the table it's a clean break and the bottom of the glass falls to floor soaking me and my wife in sticky soda and ice cream cover my wife and my legs and shoes (brand new shoes I might add) they bring over a broom and attempt to sweep this mess off the floor only making it worse. The manager finally comes to our table about 5 minutes after this happen and says ""sorry that happen I went ahead and took it off your bill for you"" umm now we are sitting her covered in this and my shoes are now trash and you are going to take off a drink. Thanks you did so much. Call it what you want more should have been done/said. Will update if anything changes. Update after we got our check they did absolutely nothing but remove the cheapest item on the bill. While we where sitting there the waitress comes up and very sarcastically says ""is that glass sturdy enough for you"" needless to say we will never be dining here again. The glass fell apart had nothing to do with anything with us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-longmont
Lisa A.,"Superior, CO",0,23,27,4.0,9/13/2017,"This would have received 5 stars but the air conditioning was on so high I had to wear a sweater inside while the temp outside was 90.  Other than that, this was the best experience we have had at a Red Robin in such a long time. Let me start with no waiting for a table at 5:45pm! What??? I know right. We are seated and our waitress asks for our drinks, she returns with fries & our drink to take our order.  They have a new burger that I tried at another RR. Since it had all my favorite ingredients I ordered it again but it was only available for a limited time. I forgot the name of it but basically it has spicy stuff like pepper jack cheese, fresh jalapeños, guacamole, fried onion strings. Yum!

Matt E.,"Pewaukee, WI",0,15,,3.0,7/13/2017,"5 stars for the manager and waiter.  1 star for the cook.  Ordered my burger medium, came out burnt to a crisp.  Inedible, a second one is cooked for me.  Also over cooked, but at least not burnt to a crisp.  Manager and waiter did what they could, and the manager offered to personally cook me a 3rd burger.  I filled up on fries so I declined.  Manager decided that I should not have to pay for my meal.  Can't say I loved my lunch, but the service kept it from being ruined.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-longmont
Kendall B.,"Longmont, CO",126,10,,2.0,1/12/2017,"Service is great depending on who's working... Ryan is by far the superstar of the restaurant. My husband and I have been going weekly for a couple years and he is the best bartender in Longmont. He is friendly, knowledgeable and extremely fast. Unfortunately it seems like every time we go now he isn't bar tending so it's not been appealing to go as often.  Also a new manager there is very entitled and when he was a server was somewhat pleasant but I wonder now if his promotion got to his head because he always used to greet us but now we just seem like an inconvenience wanting to spend money on dinner and that's a little confusing considering as a manager you should be even more interactive with your patrons. Last thing, Omission is NOT GLUTEN FREE! It says right on the bottle gluten reduced so they need to stop advertising it to their customers as gluten free. It can get people sick with gluten allergies and for such a important thing to be correct about it's disappointing that Red Robin is so careless with it. The least they can do is be accurate and not sell it as gluten free but as gluten reduced. Hope this review helps bring some important things to light because otherwise this location just seems to keep getting worse...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-longmont

We have stopped here several times over the years and while the food and service are good, it's a shame that excuses have to be made for the kitchen.   While I am not one that likes to eat rushed and get out, it's continues to be a disappointment that you are required to ask about your meals.  Get organized or find the right kitchen leader that will get the place organized!

Forrest M.,"Longmont, CO",0,3,,1.0,12/31/2016,"I've always been a fan of Red Robin, and enjoyed their food, but my experience last night was what I would consider terrible. We arrived at the restaurant at around 8:50, got a table immediately, got drinks, etc. When we asked for fries to come out ahead of time, they came, but they were all soggy. All of the fries on any of the burgers that came out with my party were also soggy. I can understand why they served older fries, because it was late at night, but I think that when one pays $15 for a burger and more for the drinks, there should be some more quality to the situation, especially considering how much Red Robin's reputation is built on it's fries. It seems like a simple task to just cook some fresh fries. All of that wasn't a big deal to me. I've dealt with that from RR before. The thing that really bugged me was that it took a while to bring out the food, and the burger, when it came out, was medium-well to well done. I consider anything over medium burned, and I ordered my burger medium-rare. The thing was really hard and tasted charred to me for the two bites I had of it. I called the waiter over and showed him the burger, and that it was burned. He went and had another one ordered. The burger for me ended up coming out around an hour later, at 9:45. Of course the other members in my party had already eaten, and I don't want to inconvenience them, and getting food one hour after coming to the restaurant is absurd in any setting, so I had him box it. I was surprised that he didn't comp it. It's insane for food to come out that late, and anyone knows that burgers just do not taste nearly as good as leftovers. Despite all that, I come today to realize that the burger they sent home with me was also burned, despite me telling them, specifically, two times, to make it medium-rare. That's some messed up management and communication between the waiters, cooks, and supervisors. I've never been so unimpressed with a Red Robin visit. If food takes longer than 35 minutes to get to a client I'd say it should be comped because that's just too long to wait for food. If you can't prepare food to order, then you shouldn't be in the food business. If he had comped the $15 to begin with, I wouldn't care so much. But I paid $15 for food that I'm just going to toss because I didn't get it when I ordered it, nor when I asked that they fix it. I don't think I'm ever going to hit this Red Robin again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-longmont

Kailu M.,"Longmont, CO",55,3,,1.0,6/28/2016,"We normally love Red Robin, but very dissatisfied after placing a to-go order this evening.

When I called and spoke with someone I was told ""oh, well thank you for letting us know"" and then they wanted to know if I was coming back to pick up the sauce. We live on the North end of town, why would we drive all the way back to pick up something based on a mistake you made!

Ian M.,"Boulder, CO",0,23,,3.0,2/5/2015,"I drive here from Boulder with my girlfriend because the Red Robin Burger Works here does not offer bottomless fries. There are many servers here who are fry Nazis and are incredibly stingy with the fries. Luckily, there's one server here named Ryan that is absolutely killing it. You want more fries? He's got it. Your water is half empty? There he is refilling it. This guy literally RUNS around the restaurant getting more accomplished every 10 minutes than the other waiters probably do in an entire shift. Unfortunately this isn't the norm. If all the waiters were like Ryan, this would be a 5 star review. Maybe you should get him to train people. If nothing else, have him explain to them that giving people what they want (fries) gets them more of what they want (tips).

We sat for 20 minutes before we had to say something to the bus boy asking where our server was. Apparently the host sat us in an unmanned area so no server wanted to wait on us. The bus boy took our drink order and then disappeared. They have tablets on each table to distract you from the nonexistent customer service and to tack on charges to your bill from the games.

During this time the waitress got our refills but didn't really take care of us. Usually if you know the food is taking longer than usual you apologize, but the only thing she said was should be right out as she was going by. She didn't even stop at our table.

When I arrived I had mentioned who the birthday girl was and the person who greeted us said okay and smiled as they took us to our booth. Then the waitress came quite some time later to take our drink order but because so much time had passed since we had been seated we were ready to give our order too. I had also mentioned to our waitress that we were there celebrating my daughters birthday and she smiled and said okay. 10 minutes into waiting for our order my daughter was looking around and seen other kids with balloons and asked me, "" Mommy, am I going to get a ballon?"" and I said, "" yes hunny, just wait."" Well our food was brought out and my chili fries were wrong and my daughter didn't get any at all with her burger, I was begining to get frustrated with my service. Did I need to request that somebody bring her a balloon and show a little special treatment for her B-day? I mentioned the food to the waitress but didn't feel comfortable mentioning the balloon I felt that I was being ""needy"" but that is why we went there. No later than our fries arrived so did a manager named TROY. I haven't seen such great service recovery in quite some time. He came to our table, acknowledged the mistake, joked with my kids, offered them all free Sundaes which was very nice of him (he did'nt have to do that), took the charge of my fries off my bill, sent out the Red Robins crew to sing happy birthday to my daughter and brought her a balloon and all this without complaining which was extra nice all I mentioned was that she didn't get her fries and mine were wrong.
