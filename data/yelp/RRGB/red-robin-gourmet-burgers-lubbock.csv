Amaris G.,"Lubbock, TX",249,20,73,4.0,3/11/2016,"It was only about a 10-15 minute wait on a Friday night. It's a good ""chill"" spot and is a very family-friendly restaurant. We had a variety: Smoked & Peppered Bacon Burger, Crab Cake Burger,  and a Grilled Chicken Lettuce Wrap with Pepper Jack Cheese and Salsa. It was moderately priced ($$) and the service was good as well. The BBQ sauce with the fries was really good too! Next time, I'm definitely going to try a milkshake or root brewski.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lubbock?start=20

Bottomless fries means you get a small serving to start off an the server disappears after you get ur food. Plain ole burger.

Lucid G.,"Denton, TX",0,8,1,2.0,10/7/2016,"I'm not giving it a two because it was disgusting, I'm giving it a two for what it's worth. The burgers tasted pretty decent, but for the price...not so much. The cheapest, most basic burger is $10, and that's without a drink. Many other places offer burgers just as good, if not better, for a more reasonable price/deal. Wasn't exactly displeased, but wasn't really too shocked about the burger itself either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lubbock?start=20
Peter L.,"Berkeley, CA",146,13,,5.0,5/27/2016,"I've been here about 20 times in the span of 2 years, and this place always delivers good quality burgers even though it's a chain restaurant.

Philip R.,"Summerville, SC",39,44,1,5.0,7/29/2015,"I have never had a bad experience with Red Robin and this location went out of its way to ensure that trend continues. I usually order the Bacon Guacamole Burger and after I asked for other suggestions, the waitress had suggested numerous other tasty options to where I decided to order the Lonestar Burger. The waitress went out of her way to ensuring that my friend and I had a pleasant time after enjoying our time at a nearby lake. Additionally, I am very picky about the temperature of my fries and as I conveyed that to her, extra care was taken ensure that all orders and request were completed. Five stars...go check it out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lubbock?start=20
Stefany B.,"North by Northwest, TX",24,2,3,4.0,5/13/2014,"Everytime a new restaurant opens in Lubbock TX, one knows not to try the restaurant for several months because of the amount of people that try to eat at a new concept. Well, my girlfriends and I ventured out to brave the newest restaurant in Lubbock.  We did have to wait but for only twenty minutes, and the people that walked out seemed very pleased. When we got seated we were greeted by a lovely server who made our first experience delightful. The burgers were wonderful, and the few drinks we got were worth the price. The atmosphere was very casual and with the dinner rush it didn't seem tense or claustrophobic as newer restaurants tend to be. I will definitely be returning when I am craving a burger and a cocktail! Red Robin really is Yum!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lubbock?start=20
Pat M.,"Midland, TX",12,57,,1.0,9/21/2016,"BF was in Lubbock yesterday on business and by phone I suggested the RR as it was close to him, and though I've never eaten in one, had vaguely heard of them for many years, that they were a burger joint and he wanted to get something quick to go and eat while driving to Midland. He said it took about 5 minutes to be waited on at the front, and it was after 2pm so was hardly anyone else in the place besides him. He told her her just wanted a jalapeño cheeseburger and a sweet tea, simple, he didn't even look at menu.   He waited and waited and waited and waited, another 25 minutes so was in there over 30 minutes to grab and burger and T to go.He paid and asked for receipt so he could get reimbursed by company and the lady said it was at bottom of bag. The bill for the burger and T was whopping over $14. And the receipt wasn't in the bag. So he didn't get reimbursed. What a rip-off and a waste of time. He didn't eat even half the burger and just one of the fries, didn't like them much and gave the rest to his dog when he got home. I felt awful for recommending the place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lubbock?start=20
James O.,"Lubbock, TX",0,2,,1.0,11/27/2016,"I was there last night (11/26/16) at about 9:30pm. The restaurant had maybe 10-15 guest. We were promptly seated in a booth we wanted. A server came to welcome us after about 6 minutes after we sat and took our drink orders....very simple a coffee, water with lemons, and diet Coke. We and another table of 6 were the only ones sitting in the bar area....I'm guessing he went to cut up the lemons himself or drove to United to buy some but, he took a while to come back with the drinks. When he did arrive he then took our order; the Firey Ghost Burger w/ steak fries & campfire sauce, and a dessert to be served when the burger was about half eaten. We've been in the restaurant for about 20 minutes at this point. When he put the order in that was the last time we saw him. We sat and talked for about 15 minutes and I finally got up and walked to where the kitchen is to find my server and a few others laughing, talking, just cutting up having a great time. I asked ""what's taking so long....where's the urgency to get it out the window."" It's hamburger meat....the place is close to closing and I've  cooked hamburger meat myself and know it doesn't take 15 minutes to cook 1 fucking burger. We then walked out the door for t he last time and they where taking the food out....walked right over to BJ's ate there and got free dessert for the terrible service we had at Red Robin. We spent more money and had better service there....they were even busier than the burger joint and people had smiles eating steak and potatoes at 11pm.   To all servers that read this....do treat your last table as if it's your first one and to restaurant owners/mangers Lubbock has several to choose from...hell how many places in Lubbock can ya eat at?? Texas Land & Cattle is closed, Buffalo Burgers is closed....etc catch my drift?? I was  really excited when Red Robin opened here.... now I don't give a fuck...will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lubbock?start=20
M M.,"Odessa, TX",1,45,89,5.0,4/3/2016,"We went here on a Saturday afternoon (4/2/16) and they were pretty busy, but no wait to be seated. Our waitress Courtney was awesome! She was super friendly, and didn't even blink an eye when she saw me wiping the table, silverware and ketchup bottle down with a sanitizing wipe (It wasn't dirty, I'm just a bit of a germiphobe-I clean everything. You should see me when I have to stay in a hotel..).  Courtney was so fast to help us, even though she was waiting on the majority of tables on our side, took note of my daughter's peanut allergy and made sure the guys preparing the food knew as well. She checked with us often, made sure we always had drinks, napkins (we had kids with us, so a constant necessity!), anything we needed. We ordered a lot, and our food was out quickly! Service was amazing! I could hear her with the other tables, and she was so nice to everyone, and fast! Even the manager, Patrick, was going around to the tables greeting people, and making sure customers were happy with their food, service, etc. I have only seen managers and chefs do that at expensive restaurants, so that's amazing. It definitely didn't feel like we were eating at a usual fast food joint. My husband had the fish basket, which you wouldn't think would be good at a burger place, but it was great! I had the onion ring stack, which was yummy-crunchy and not over-salted. The milk shakes are super sweet and the vanilla tasted almost like birthday cake-so good. We also had the bottomless rootbeer float, and I had a burger (can't remember the name); it had mushrooms, onion straws and an onion bun. It tastes so good, especially paired up with their Mai Tai, which is the best I have had at a chain restaurant (of course, there is nothing like making your own-maybe just because I double the booze..). Too often mixed drinks taste like powder mix, but this one was sweet and packed a punch. We ordered two kids meals; the chicken tenders were good, they didn't look like the frozen and shaped tenders you find elsewhere; and a kids burger; they give you the option of a beef or turkey patty, both with bottomless fries, bottomless root beer float, 2 kids milk shakes, a fish basket, onion ring stack, chili cheese fries, my onion burger and Mai Tai and the bill came out to about $70.  They have a few big screens, you can sit close to them or not.  Great service, great experience. The place was clean and updated, no food/fries littering the floor (yes, I was looking), even though it was right after the lunch rush. They also have a few parking spots right by the door that are designated for pickup; you can call in an order and pick it up there. I added a few photos, sorry they look hazy but I officially have the oldest functioning cell phone in the world, and all the photos I take with it look dull!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lubbock?start=20

Brandi U.,"Fort Worth, TX",9,40,18,2.0,10/5/2014,"This was our first visit to the Lubbock location, but we've been to other Red Robin's in the DFW area. This one was lacking in service and the food wasn't as tasty as other locations. I was surprised at how old this location looked for a newer restaurant.  The service was lacking. My husband's burger came out incorrectly and rather than remaking it our server brought out the missing ingredients for him to make his burger correctly. My kid didn't eat the ""spaghetti"" and it didn't look appetizing. My burger with pepper bacon tasted mostly like pepper.  You do get unlimited fries, unlimited sides if you pay to upgrade from fries, and you can order an unlimited root beer float which is mostly soft serve but comes with extra root beer on the side.

Mel E.,"Houston, TX",330,345,1380,3.0,3/1/2016,"Red Robin is a popular chain restaurant and if you've never eaten at one, you gotta try it. My friends and I were in Lubbock and were surprised that there was a restaurant in town. This location seems to be very busy, many families eating here. Obviously ordering burgers are a must, but their steak fries are also delicious which comes with every burger. And not only are they delicious, they're bottomless, so you can keep on ordering fries at no extra charge, but you just need to inform your waiter when you're ready for your next batch. You can also upgrade your fries to sweet potato or garlic parm if you'd like, and they're also bottomless. Whenever I visit a Red Robin, I always treat myself to a freckled lemonade, and yes, it is bottomless too. The burgers here don't disappoint, always juicy and satisfies my hunger. My favorites are the shroom and the cheeseburger, very simple but on point. This restaurant had the standard Red Robin furniture but their bar area looks fun and trendy, very cool. I think the only downfall to my visit is the waiter, I think it may have been his first time serving a big group (12 ppl), he seemed to get rattled quickly and kept forgetting things. He had another person get our drink orders as well. And another patron approached him while he was at our table to ask for their check.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lubbock

The only problem is that we added bacon and they forgot to put it on the burger but we didn't realize until the last few bites because the burger was that good!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lubbock?start=40
Michelle G.,"Lubbock, TX",0,4,,4.0,6/15/2015,"The chicken burgers are great! It's perhaps a tad pricey for this variety of eatery, but it's consistently good. We eat here a lot because the kids love it and it has quite a bit of variety really, with the various specialty burgers, and sandwiches. I've ordered at least 5 different options by now and have t yet come across one I didn't enjoy. We are happy to have Red Robin in Lubbock finally! If you are fortunate enough to get Ken as your server, you will certainly be well taken care of, above and beyond. Though all the staff is friendly, every visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lubbock?start=40
Barbara C.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,2,,5.0,10/17/2015,Great service!  I had 20 minutes before a meeting when visiting Lubbock on business. I asked the manager when I arrived if they could get me in and out in 15 minutes. With a huge smile she said they would!  Took my order sat me down and she went in the kitchen and I heard her give my order on the fly!  My turkey burger was great and I was in and out and made it to my meeting on time. Loved the can do attitude of that manager. She was warm and friendly and made sure I was taken care of!  Thanks so much!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lubbock?start=40
Laura A.,"Lubbock, TX",16,2,,1.0,4/15/2015,"Went last night. Had not eaten all day and was hungry.  My son and I ordered burgers and I ordered a cup of French Onion soup to come out before the meal.  They cook their burgers medium which I don't mind.  But when the food sits in the window waiting to be delivered,  they get soggy.   The broccoli that I ordered was old, very chewy.   The ""bottomless fries"" my son ordered were not refilled nor did they ask if he wanted more.    My soup did not get delivered.   Manager brought to me after she came and ask how our food was.  But the French Onion soup was not edible.   More salt in it then onions.   Server was bad.  We will not be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lubbock?start=40
Leo S.,"Dallas, TX",15,127,130,4.0,5/25/2014,"Yesterday was my first time to visit Red Robin in Lubbock Texas. I currently live in Dallas Texas where the Red Robin prominent. Being originally from Lubbock I'm glad to see more restaurants like this especially when the service is outstanding. As I went to this restaurant I was greeted very professionally and with high enthusiasm. After waiting a short time, I was sat in the back section with the server by the name of Cody G. It wasn't long before Cody came to our table even though the restaurant was highly crowded. He took our order for drinks and offered us a cocktail. We did take him up on a few the specialty drinks I can't remember the name of mine but it had agave tequila in it and was a martini.  We then placed our order for the main entree. I ordered a new burger which I have not tried before I believe it's called The Royal with an egg on top. After I order was placed we were checked on several times to make sure that our drinks were at a level that was satisfactory to us. Our food was delivered promptly and hot. We enjoyed our meal then we got our check only after being offered dessert. Due to the amount of food that we ate prior to being offered dessert there was no way we were going to be able to eat dessert. We paid our check we then left and I can honestly say I was completely satisfied with this visit and would suggest this location to anyone. Keep up the good work and welcome to Lubbock Red Robin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lubbock?start=40
Danielle L.,"Lubbock, TX",0,1,,1.0,12/5/2014,"I went to Red Robin tonight for dinner. My waiter, Lance was not personable. He didn't seem like he enjoyed his job at all. I am very disappointed in the service Lance provided.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lubbock?start=40
Larry B.,"Lubbock, TX",0,19,,3.0,6/30/2014,"Burgers were ok, fish was burned, fries were good but we asked for more fries and never got any.  So much for all you want fries.  Service was OK, other than not getting fries.  Pricey.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lubbock?start=40
Alyse S.,"Austin, TX",1,5,,2.0,6/16/2014,"Service started out bad and became worse. I don't blame her. I blame the quadruple seating of tables (2 big tops-we were a table of 10), the lack of consideration and teamwork of others, the inadequate degree of professionalism exhibited from managers, and the noticeably insufficient training across the board. The food was less than good and absolutely not worth the cost. We weren't even thanked after spending almost $300 in the establishment by the five employees chit chatting. Also, quit holding plates, glasses, etc over the head of a child when clearing or serving a table. And if your servers can't hold more than four drinks on a tray, they aren't ready for the floor. Additionally, perhaps utilizing the pivot point system at tables could help with the yelling of food orders, the missing sauces and the ridiculous ticket times because your (very quiet) food runner doesn't know where to put plates down",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lubbock?start=40
