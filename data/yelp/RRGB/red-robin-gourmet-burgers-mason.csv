Cindy W.,"Cincinnati, OH",221,116,610,4.0,10/12/2017,"UPDATE AS OF OCTOBER 2017: I'm changing my rating back to 4 stars. Management has changed, as well as several staff members at this location. It seems as if the rules have changed with having bottomless fries and salad to come out before the meal. I have been back a few times after writing my original review, and I have been given fries and or salad before the meal arrived without a fight. This is a major positive impact, as their menu calls out their 'claim to fame' with bottomless fries and salad. I'm glad they have welcomed this feature back. Since my retina review, they have also provided a digital way to check out. This mini computer allows you to ask for refills, call your server, as well as check for your royalty points. You can even pay your bill, as well as play games on this miniature iPad.  I am a huge fan of their 'buy 10 burgers get one free' option. This is a positive bonus that makes me want to return to this restaurant, as the burger choices are endless. I feel like they have added a new burger each time I have visited.  Thank you to staying true to your motto of bottomless fries! I'm super glad this has been welcomed back into the routine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mason
Matthew C.,"Cincinnati, OH",1,163,2,3.0,11/24/2017,"My kids love Red Robin! My oldest likes meatballs on a stick while my youngest likes that she can get pizza and French fries. While I do like the fries, I made the mistake of ordering a wrap at a burger place. I am still looking for the chicken that was supposed to be in the wrap. I have not found it. I do find it irritating that they offer kids the use of an entertainment device and then put an entertainment charge on the bill without asking you about it. While the kids love it, it feels like they are just pumping up the bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mason

Paul K.,"Cincinnati, OH",3,42,27,4.0,2/6/2017,"I've been to this location before but was a bit disappointed, I found the one in the Kenwood Mall to be better. However, that being said, tonight they redeemed themselves! The service was great, we were seated quickly and our food came out in short time. Red Robin makes a tasty burger, so this satisfies my burger craving! A nice extra is their fries and lemonades are bottomless. We had the sweet potato fries and really enjoyed them as well. Overall, despite previous disappointments at this location, I will go back hoping that was just an off day for them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mason

Tara S.,"Fort Thomas, KY",34,52,24,4.0,12/18/2016,"Lunch with a friend, second time going to Red Robin for lunch.  Both times I got the veggie burger, this last time I also got the black bean side dish, it was delicious.  I would return for the black beans alone, the veggie burger is pretty standard, just a grilled Boca veggie burger - though that is what I make at home so, no worries. It would be great to see them do a from scratch veggie burger rather than using Boca, that is my only criticism, basically I think it sells Red Robin a bit short to offer all those mouthwatering burgers for the carnivores and not something in kind for the vegetarians.  Maybe in the future though... Service is always prompt, staff is courteous.  Red Robin is a great lunch destination in my book.  Will definitely return in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mason

Brad C.,"South Lebanon, OH",0,11,,1.0,6/6/2017,"We've been going to Red Robin for years but this this last visit was rough. Walking into the restaurant the sidewalk was covered in duck waste.

Friesianexile ..,"Pleasant Prairie, WI",2,12,,2.0,11/30/2016,"The food was good but the service was awful! I and my boyfriend went to dinner here after a full day at Kings island. We got an older waiter who seemed very un interested in doing his job. He obviously thought it was my boyfriend who would be paying the bill and gave him better service, refilling his drink and fries overall giving him more attention and totally ignoring me. Maybe he thought I was ""fat"" and therefore didn't ""need"" anymore fries, if that was the case he should look in the mirror. I didn't get any refills although I would have liked them. Unfortunately for him, I was the one paying the bill and the one who decided the tip amount!

Holly S.,"Cincinnati, OH",56,256,269,3.0,1/19/2015,"Came in with my activated Royalty Card on my birthday (today) with proof of my birthday (license). Assistant Manager and waiter told me the card had not been activated a month in advance, so I could come back in a month maybe? Harrumph. Then, to the food.... My fries this visit are cold, oily and burned.  The ""medium"" burger I got was pink throughout... assistant manager wearing glasses blamed our brilliant waiter James and said he should have explained the two levels of medium. Apparently the ""fully brown medium"" my mom ordered was somehow different than the ""bloody pink medium"" one I got... and we both ordered the burgers cooked exactly the same way. Medium.  This assistant manager even offered to go in the back and print out the ""standards"" of medium so I could see that there are two distinct levels of ""medium"" and therefore, the kitchen did not screw up. Not good. Later in the meal... Real manager came by to apologize for the re-make of my burger (I grew up in So. CA with salmonella Jack in the Box burgers, so I will not eat any burger with bright pink meat in it), he said Red Robin really does NOT  have two different categories of ""medium""  and he was aghast (1) that we were told there were two different categories of medium, and (2) both of our burgers (ordered medium ) came out looking so radically different. They gave me my burger for free, gave me a birthday sundae in a ""go cup"" and invited me to come back as soon as tomorrow for my free birthday burger and another free birthday sundae. I'm happier than I was. And now... a year older too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mason
Emily L.,"Cincinnati, OH",53,316,19,2.0,1/19/2016,"I experienced very poor service here, but the food was good. My mother and I went for a late lunch. We were seated in the bar area. We quickly figured out that we would not have an actual waiter, but the bartender would be taking care of us. A different waiter came and took our drink order. The bartender was busy making other people's drinks. We finally received our drinks from somebody else, so we could not have our order taken. The bartender finally came over to take our order. A cook delivered our meal to us and we realized we had no silverware or napkins. We had to ask yet another waiter who wasn't taking care of us for silverware. The bartender hardly checked on us at all. We didn't leave much tip because we honestly didn't know who it would go to, since so many different people waited on us.

Dom A.,"Cincinnati, OH",22,10,18,5.0,2/28/2015,"This is the third or fourth time we've taken our entire family out to Red Robin (we have two small kids) and they have never disappointed. This is great place for the family - from the menu options to the friendly, patient staff.  This time we started off with the onion rings - WOW - they are so good. I ordered the Whiskey River Burger, one of my personal favorites. I'd recommend that to anyone. The BBQ sauce is tangy and sweet, and the onions on it create a nice balance between the salty and sweet flavors. Fries are good - I can never finish a second order, even when my kids help.  The service has always been great, and this time was no different. We were seated next to kitchen, which provided a nice distraction for the kids, and allowed my wife and I to steal away a few moments of pleasant conversation.  This is a good place for a family night out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mason
Heather L.,"Batavia, OH",71,469,581,2.0,11/22/2015,"Really disappointing. This location is close to my house and have been going here for a while. Each time the quality declines. I used to feel like it was a good deal with generous bottomless fries and well loaded burgers. On this occasion, I ordered a burger, that I have in the past, and now it barely had any toppings on it. What was supposed to be fried onion straws was soggy. I couldve picked up all the fries on my plate in one hand and NEVER was I offered a refill. My friend took advantage of the bottomless Rootbeer floats, which is a good deal, but probably a bad idea, haha. He experienced the same skimpy burger and fry. Our waiter service was helpful and he kept our drinks full and thats about the ONLY thing I can compliment on this visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mason
Tom Z.,"West Chester Township, OH",16,38,1,2.0,8/1/2017,"Typically my experience at red robin is 4 stars. Today, I left very disappointed. I ordered the southern charm burger. I was asked how I wanted it prepared and I said please on the pink side. Normally, it's not a problem for red robin to serve up a perfectly cooked burger at any location. I've never been let down. My burger came out w/ no pink at all. Pressing down on it I found it wasn't even moist. Mgr was friendly and said we'll make you another one. Next burger came out the exact same way!! No pink at all! You would think that the 2nd burger would have been checked before going out to the table. I said I have to get back to work, and can't wait on a 3rd try. I wasn't charged anything including my beer. Happy I didnt have to pay for the beer, but Mgr never came back out to apologize. Waitress said you are good, meaning I didn't have to pay for anything. So I left.

Jammed in between other tables filled with other parties and in such close proximity that normal conversation wasn't possible. Asked for something a bit more private and was seated in the same type open crowded tables but on opposite side of room.  Food fair.

One point of improvement I suggest is that the keep it simple burger is a little thin. I'm sure I could find a thicker burger if I had ordered something different.

I'm usually not a huge fan of chains, but Red Robin does burgers well. I'm especially fond of the Royal Red Robin burger. The bottomless fries are also a nice touch, so I can get even fatter! They also have sweet potato fries and garlic fries.  Pro Tip- Don't forget to get some sauces for your fries. They have a Thai Chili, and my personal favorite, campfire sauce. These are great for dipping your fries in.  As far as ambiance, the only annoying thing is people bring their kids here for birthdays like crazy.

The food was okay, but the place seemed dirty, the tables were so close together the wait staff kept bumping into me as they walked by to their station and we had to ask for silverware after our food was delivered. To top it off, they have these tabletop electronic kiosks where they'd like you to place your order and pay your bill instead of bothering your waitstaff - it gets in the way on a four top covered in dishes, it seems to foster lackluster service and while we were successful in paying our bill on it, it is difficult to read, bulky to handle and printed out a blank receipt.

Martin D.,"Plainfield, IL",0,31,4,4.0,3/23/2012,"This is a full service burger joint (i.e. you are waited on).  Their specialty is ""gourmet"" burgers, which they do well. We went here last night. I had a Royal Red Robin Burger. I love this burger.  It is different as it comes with a fried egg on it along with bacon, cheese, lettuce, onion, and tomato (minus tomato for me).  A fried egg may seem odd, but it is actually quite excellent.  While me and the family like Red Robin, I try not to go to often as it would not be a good healthy choice to have especially with bottomless fries.  In truth the burger is big enough that I don 't eat the fries. The kids love the bottomless freckled lemonade   Its a good thing these are ""bottomless"" because they can go through several glasses no problem. Sodas and fries are bottomless as well.  The atmosphere is definitely casual and fairly noisy when they are busy.  They, also, have several TV's in the bar and the restaurant area showing whatever the current sporting event is (we watched NCAA Tournament Ohio State/ UC game while we ate our dinner).  As others have said service can be hit or miss.  It was good last night.

Michael H.,"Cincinnati, OH",397,96,6,2.0,12/7/2010,"I went back to Red Robin in Mason again for lunch with the wife and kids. We went for a later lunch, so it was well after the Friday lunch rush. The luck of the draw, we get the server in training. After some confusion and a 10 minute wait for drinks, we finally get our order in. Once our actual server took over, things smoothed out. They were very pleasant and attentive after things got going, but clearly disjointed, distracted, and the trainee was extremely nervous. I can get past that. Everyone is a rookie at some point .  The real issue is that I don't think the management is all that great. There weren't many people in the place, in fact there were as many staff members as patrons. All the staff members looked really busy - all of them were doing ""things"". Few of them were actually paying attention to customers. I noticed several other tables in sort of a holding pattern - looking around. Employees working hard at looking busy is a real indicator of a deeper problem. So now it's mealtime. Onion ring tower, a couple of burgers, a corn dog for the kid and drinks. $33 I mean... it's not bad. It's a burger. How spectacular can a burger actually become?

Great food and the endless fries are a bit of a gimmick (you'll probably never eat all they bring you the first time!) but they're mm mm good. Like a lot of places, they get you on the alcohol and pop so if you can avoid them you'll come out ahead when the check comes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mason?start=40
Caroline C.,"Cincinnati, OH",214,321,74,4.0,12/11/2009,"OK, I'll admit it, I'm a chain-hater.  Most chain restaurants make my stomach turn when I think about the ridiculously large portions of re-heated slop.  shudder. Red Robin is the only chain that I willingly go to these days.   They nailed it with their slogan:  Red Robin - Yummm.  Yes, the burgers are huge (and sloppy) but at least everything tastes fresh and prepared to order.  I'm in love with the ""Bleu Ribbon Burger""  Bleu cheese, onion straws, onion bun, chipotle mayo.  Yummm",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mason?start=40
Andrea C.,"Maineville, OH",22,19,,3.0,5/5/2014,"Great food, great server. In the past, service has been pretty hit or miss, with some servers being totally on the ball and some presenting a total suck-fest. Last night our server was cute, funny and pretty efficient. A tad slow on refills, but you know the story with me on those by now anyway - probably would have been more than sufficient for a normal person. Her recommendation of the Burnin' Love burger for the lovely beau turned out to be right on - it was hot, spicy, jalapeno-y goodness (p.s. I ate his scraps). The atmosphere is another story, as they're definitely sporting a weird Applebee's-in-the-90s meets Chuck E Cheese vibe. The place sorely needs an update, especially since ""gourmet burgers"" are their claim to fame. The burgers are kick-ass for sure, but the decor is a tacky enamel junk fest. Seriously, a fucking merry-go-round horse? Up your game, Red Robin, but keep the delicious burgers coming.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mason?start=40
Janelle S.,"Cincinnati, OH",92,29,8,4.0,9/21/2011,"I'm a burger enthusiast and while Red Robin is a chain, don't count it out just yet. I have made the decision to try a different burger every time I go, which has proven to be a wise choice. I have had the Burnin' Love burger and the Bleu Ribbon burger, both of which were good. But on my most recent trip I decided to try the Royal Red Robin burger that included: fried egg, bacon, american cheese, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. WOW! The burger was presented beautifully and the taste was even better. The taste of everything together was fantastic. And when accompanied with bottomless steak fries, how can you pass this up?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mason?start=40
Elizabeth V.,"Mason, OH",0,2,,2.0,3/6/2012,"Went to Red Robin this evening because we had an email about the free Oreo shake in honor or the Oreo's birthday!  It's disappointing to say that the service  tonight was not up to par.  I ordered the California Chicken Sandwich with a side of Mac and Cheese.  After a long wait, my sandwich was cold.  The chicken was colder than the Guacamole and the Provolone cheese was stiff like cardboard.  On the flip side, the mac and cheese cup was blazing hot and good.   When the Manager came to apologize, she asked if there was anything else we needed, my five year old son asked for additional oranges.  She said okay and NEVER came back!  I, mentioned it the our waiter and instead of getting what my son wanted, we got our bill.   Very disappointed for the Manager on duty and her wait staff as I had to explain to my child that they did not want to give him anymore oranges. The shake was Meh, okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mason?start=40
Stephanie K.,"Maineville, OH",99,18,1,5.0,7/5/2012,Very busy but the staff is on their feet with handling the crowds. Great food and expedient service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mason?start=40
Ryan C.,"Cincinnati, OH",135,68,17,4.0,12/18/2010,"Red Robin is definitely my favorite burger chain. You can almost always find a burger to satisfy your taste buds. The bar is decently stocked, so go ahead and order your favorite. The service can be a hit or miss. Everybody is nice but can take a little bit longer depending if they are new or not. There can be way too many kids for my liking but that's kinda what you need to expect. If you don't want to be around a bunch of kids, I would suggest having either an early or late dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mason?start=40
Jeremiah B.,"Lexington, KY",1,3,2,5.0,9/18/2010,Awesome new menu!  Bottomless root beer floats!  Red made an appearance and made my son's night. Awesome family environment.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mason?start=40
Emma M.,"Covington, KY",12,82,11,5.0,2/28/2011,My all time favorite place to eat. Such awesome food and drinks. It is not the cheapest place to grab a burger but definitely the best. They accommodate vegetarians which makes them that much more enjoyable!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mason?start=40
Kara K.,"Columbus, OH",18,277,,5.0,3/28/2011,"I love Red Robin, I strongly dislike children.  As a result, I rarely go to Red Robin.  But when they offer good deals like the free birthday burger, it's hard to pass up.  So the BF & I went.  Each time we cross our fingers that the hostess will realize our discomfort and sit us far away from a table of kiddies.  This past Saturday, the hostess did not.  However we hadn't been at the table 30 seconds when a manager appeared and asked us if we would like to move to a booth.  Absolutely!  She made our night (and the food) much more enjoyable.  We cannot thank her enough!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mason?start=40
