Tim S.,"Conway, AR",1,2,,5.0,8/9/2015,"Red Robin is always a great dining experience but today--- lets talk about John. John stands approximately 6 feet tall, appears to be in his early twenties, and sports a great attitude; all of this combined with John's savvy yet conservative normcore fashion sense should be enough to assure any guest of an exceptional experience.  Suffice it to say, the fries are not the only thing that's bottomless at Red Robin: John's grace, good nature, timing, and spirit of giving never seem to run out. Here's to you, John, a real American hero. Never change.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-maumee
Jr P.,"Toledo, OH",1,11,1,2.0,7/9/2017,"Poor, slow service. Everything seemed to take a while. Our waitress needs some training....  the burgers were maybe  B+, the fries were ok.  They literally ran out of chicken fingers  They ran out of the juice my son wanted The brought out dirty silverware and left it in a pile on the end out the table (which was sticky) Overall i was disappointed with my experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-maumee
Chris P.,"Toledo, OH",0,11,3,2.0,9/16/2016,"Chip to guac ratio: way off...  Macaroni and cheese burger was loaded with creamy goodness in the menu but when it arrived at the table it had 3 macaronis :( The milkshake was incredible. But, at room temperature :(  Lady friend got a messy lettuce bun sandwich. No napkins till long after juice was dripping off her elbows.

Ben H.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,1,,1.0,9/29/2017,Myself and my wife usually cook at home and now I know why. 80$ for 2 cheese burgers and 3 kids that got kids pizza and one got chicken fingers! Food was not that good and the price was ridiculous. Save your money and buy groceries at the store and feed your families!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-maumee
Brian G.,"Maumee, OH",7,133,21,3.0,2/18/2017,A burger is a burger. The place is consistent if nothing else. Hamburger and endless fries and a free cardiology referral afterward. Burgers have decent flavor but the noise and the decor are a bit much. Nothing super special and nothing bad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-maumee
Jessica B.,"Atlanta, GA",16,2,1,1.0,7/28/2016,This place has really gone down hill. They had the best veggie burger that I would come for. And of course endless fries. We use to come in order beers and fries as appetizer but now they charge to have as app even if your ordering a appetizer? Just do away with them because that's not really bottomless fries if your charging for them.   My family (3 of use) came in about 3pm. They were slow. We were sat at a dirty table. Went to go the next one and they were all dirty. Finally someone came and cleaned the one table for us. Server jasmine was cool. Nothing special though. We sat and ate our entire meal with the table behind us completely dirty with the previous persons food n dishes sitting out. Their was also a table of managers just sitting in a booth. When we went to the rest room their was a swifter wrapped in the same towel they use for the tables. Their were also several flies in there. I'd be curious to know the health department score. I will never be returning to RR unfortunately.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-maumee
Jack B.,"Newark, OH",0,2,1,2.0,12/30/2016,"The food is really good but the customer service isn't the greatest. I ordered the wedge burger and it came with a ""salad"" which was nothing of a salad.

Matt D.,"Toledo, OH",150,13,4,3.0,10/7/2016,"Food was good, cooked to order and not an issue. Server was OVERLY friendly... hun and babe were fluent toward my wife and myself. Which gets real old real quick... also, when we were both done eating, both of our plates plus 4 glasses were sitting on the end of the table and she checked on us 4 times without taking them. We were at a super small table and found it VERY inconvenient. The manager ended up grabbing them on the 5th trip for an employee to the table after we were done eating. Drinks were always full and the food was tasty, but at the end of the day quit it with the hun and babe shit and clean the table off when we are done!?!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-maumee

Dustin M. R.,"Pemberville, OH",5,61,76,3.0,8/3/2015,"My wife and I went to Red Robin for a 2pm lunch hoping that it would not be crazy busy.  Unfortunately for us, the restaurant was still crazy busy. While we were seated almost immediately at a table, it took almost 5 minutes for our waitress to come over.  Since we had plenty of time to stare at the menu, we went ahead and ordered our full meal, rather than just drinks.  We ordered a guacamole burger on a gluten-free bun, a southern charm burger with sweet potato fries, a Dr. Pepper, and rootbeer float.  Before tax and tip, our bill came to $33.74. Décor in the restaurant was vintage movies, which we liked, but had a hard time enjoying because it was so freaking loud. The music was loud, which caused the patrons around us to have to yell to be heard, which might not have been so bad if they were not 10 inches away from us on the other side of the partition separating our tables. Since the restaurant was busy we expected it to take a while to get our food ... and we were not disappointed. Once it finally arrived, our food looked great and tasted great, but both of our sandwiches were very messy and drippy. In fact, once I finished my sandwich, I excused myself to the restroom to wash my hands, as the one napkin I had could not hope to accomplish the job.  We also liked the endless fries, but quickly discovered that our table's ketchup bottle only had about a tablespoon of the good stuff left, and had to flag down a waitress for another bottle.  Additionally we found the food portion sizes to be typical for the prices.  Our harried but friendly waitress checked back with us a couple times during our meal and brought us a drink refill when asked. Overall we rate Red Robin as being Good, and would return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-maumee
Todd P.,"Holland, OH",0,6,,3.0,3/14/2015,I hope the food is good because the wait is terribly long.  I'm sadly staring at many empty tables and the 3-4 hostess are working off four lists.  Never seen that before and I have a degree in hotel/restaurant management.

Joe G.,"Lynchburg, VA",19,5,,2.0,9/9/2015,We'll see how it goes but our first impression is not good. Waited far too long to be seated on a night where there was no line. After being seated had plenty of time to peruse the menu before being approached by a server. We were more than ready to order by the time she arrived. We are here because of a gift card and at this rate won't be back soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-maumee
Veronica R.,"Toledo, OH",0,15,4,2.0,9/6/2015,"Not a good experience. Which is really unfortunate considering total bill without tip was $37 for two burger meals and lemonade. Table was sticky, seats not clean and floor area was littered. One burger wasn't cooked properly, requested sauce wasn't delivered and took very long time for drinks to arrive. Not to be petty, but coasters also weren't provided on a hot day so glasses were dripping on shirt with every sip and waitress wasn't using check presenter to keep bill & credit card private. Sadly, this was the 2nd time we experienced poor/slow service and there won't be a third.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-maumee

Faith C.,"Toledo, OH",64,296,422,4.0,6/26/2012,"I've always been a fan of Red Robin. This was the first time that I'd been to this location.  I ordered a burger and specifically asked that the burger and egg on the burger be well cooked because I have dietary restrictions but when the burger came, the inside was raw and the egg was runny.  Usually, I don't like to send back food but it was too raw for me to eat so I sent it back.  I usually would give a lower rating because they messed up my order even though I gave specific instructions, but the waitress and the manager were super nice. And the new burger they made was made correctly and was super delicious! Yea for second chances and getting it right!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-maumee
Karen M.,"Swanton, OH",4,1,,3.0,3/30/2015,"The food is delicious but the service at this location is lacking. We have had our waitress pass our table several times without stopping to refill drinks or sides.

Rieale L.,"Toledo, OH",24,88,68,1.0,8/12/2015,"Our party of four walked in at 7:15 with the intention to grab dinner before our 8:30 movie (Antman).  The hostesses were nice and efficient though we were seated on a booth that was ripped up and crudely taped together.  The restaurant was about 1/4 full and numerous servers were milling about.  Our server arrived and seemed confused, awkward and lacked a smile and basic knowledge of how to serve a table.  We ordered an appetizer and our burgers - all standard, nothing custom.  We mentioned that we were trying to get out by 8:15 for a show next door.  Someone else delivered the queso app and the server was no where to be found.  Finally, I flagged down another server that wasn't ours to ask if he could find ours.  Time ticked by and it was then 40 mins later.  Sandwiches were delivered, and I asked for our bills so we could scarf and scatter.  Again, the server disappeared, and I had to request our bills from someone else.  The server showed up at 8:25 with the checks sans apology or even eye contact.  Oh...he then ran our cards and didn't bother giving us a pen.  It was an odd experience, and I felt ripped off to pay $11 for a sandwich, wrong side and no drink refills.  I'm not a big fan of chains in general, but at times, the service and food can prove me wrong.  Well, not this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-maumee?start=20
Robert F.,"Whitehouse, OH",0,6,,1.0,11/10/2015,"I have been wanting a good burger. I was deciding between Red Robin or Five guys. I've never been to either. I ended up going with Red because it was closer. I sat at the bar. I had to wait and no one was sitting at the bar other than myself. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with bbq sauce, lettuce and pickles. I waited for quite awhile on this burger. It wasn't what I ordered. It had no bacon, no bbq sauce or cheese on it. You'd figure with the long wait it would come out correctly. Then they just threw a couple strips of bacon and hardly any bbq sauce on it mind you they brought me a piece of cheese on a separate plate instead of having it melted on the burger. I also had an onion ring in with my fries. After all that for them to claim the have gourmet burgers is a little far fetched in my opinion. I was highly disappointed in the taste and quality. I will never return to Red Robin again. I don't recommend this place if you like or want a good burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-maumee?start=20
Nicole V.,"Swanton, OH",2,38,3,4.0,9/11/2014,I love Red Robin. I'm a vegetarian and the Gardenburger is great. My family eats meat and loves the meals they order. I would've given 5 stars if they still had the jalapeno coins on the appetizer menu. They took them off over a year ago and substituted appetizers that aren't good. We've been here with very large groups and just our family of four and the service is good every time.

Chelsea J.,"Columbus, OH",1,15,,1.0,7/18/2016,"Probably the worst dining experience ever. There were literally 5 hostesses standing there not really doing anything, and it wasn't even that busy. We sat down and proceeded to order. We didn't even order that much food and every table around us that showed up after we did got their food before us. 40 minutes later our food arrives... Mine was undercooked and my moms was hard as a rock from sitting under the heat lamp for too long. Clearly this was the kitchens fault. I worked in a restaurant and constantly had to deal with angry customers because of the kitchen. The difference? My restaurant was constantly understaffed in all areas and this place wasn't. And even though it was mainly the kitchen, the waitress wasn't that good either. Never really bothering to check on us for refills and there were a few times I saw her standing around doing nothing. Lol. At the very least the manager came over and gave us half off, so that's the one thing they did right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-maumee?start=20
Pat W.,"Maumee, OH",12,191,23,4.0,10/16/2014,"The menu is pretty simple but it is supposed to be, with a focus on hamburgers.  They have unlimited fries, so don't eat to much or you will need to exercise longer to burn it off....but they are pretty good.  The burgers are larger in size and taste good.  The atmosphere is lively during busy times and is modern and nice.  It is a chain, which I typically don't like, but worth a visit from time to time.  This location is at Fallen Timbers mall which is nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-maumee?start=20
Stacey O.,"Clyde, OH",0,5,,1.0,7/1/2015,"If I could give this business a zero, I would. The only good thing that I can say is that our server was nice. Our order was placed at 12:05 PM and we received our cold, nasty food at 12:45 PM.

Jennifer M.,"Youngstown, OH",1,1,1,2.0,6/8/2014,Took the family here after a soccer tournament and had horrible service. The waitress Amanda was an absolute b****. They were out of diet coke and her reasoning behind it was because she didn't do the ordering.

Carolyn E.,"Delaware, OH",28,185,202,3.0,1/15/2012,"I generally don't like Red Robin, no matter the location - there's  too much stuff on their food, yet not enough flavor for my taste.  However, I did enjoy my last visit where I split one of the seafood baskets with my Mom, who suggested we go there.  The waitress had no problem with this set up as we both got a cup of clam chowder to round it out.   The meal overall was pretty good, one of the better experiences I've had at any branch of this chain, with the seafood tasting very fresh and not too greasy despite being fried. The basket also came with fries, and I was a bit upset at first to see a bunch of the fries laying in grease that had dripped off the seafood, rendering them, in my opinion, inedible.  Not a problem, though.  The server got me a fresh basket of fries which were very good. We did decline dessert - the desserts at this chain are never as good as they sound imo.  They also are known for their milkshakes, if you prefer one of those as a sweet treat, though again, I am not a fan of theirs in particular.  I personally like shakes to be so thick that you need a spoon to eat them - super thin, whipped ice cream.  Red Robins' are okay if you like the more milk-like shakes, I guess.  I also like that you can ask to sample a flavor if you are hesitant to try something.   Atmosphere is the typical Red Robin...heck, typical U.S. mid-level ""let's party"" chain.  ....i.e. there's so much stuff on the walls you can't see the paint.  Some of the items are pretty interesting, though.  Lots of old movie posters.  Overall, everything is very shiny and brightly colored.   It also isn't horribly noisy, though it's definitely not a place for a quiet romantic dinner either.   Service is fine - friendly, efficient - no complaints.   Overall, its' a decent place, especially if you have kids.  They'll love the bright colors and milkshakes.  It's not my favorite chain, but it's not bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-maumee?start=20

(I hate that)      On to the main course (poor waitress).  As we receive our main course the burgers looked good.  As my wife started to eat she found a hair in the patty.  So her appetite was gone.  My burger was a little better because I was able to eat more of my burger until I found the center was completely raw.        The service was excellent the food not so much.  Will try again at another date because I have had good food there before",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-maumee?start=20
