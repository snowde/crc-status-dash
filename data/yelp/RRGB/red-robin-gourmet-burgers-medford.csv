Laurel G.,"Ashland, OR",0,61,,2.0,11/21/2017,"I'm rewriting this review.  I've always liked Red Robin's burgers and would happily eat there, but last Sunday evening took the cake on this place for horrible customer service.  My last review mentioned spotty, slow service that I hoped they could overcome,  but this was over the top bad.   So my friend and I ordered two burgers.  His a lettuce wrap as he's gluten intolerant.  He told the waiter, no mayo or cheese as he's allergic to dairy and eggs.  The waiter assured him that neither came on that burger.  Okay, great! We wait for close to 45 minutes to get our food.  Two burgers, nothing fancy and right in their wheelhouse.  We thought.  FINALLY the food arrives.  His burger is covered in melted cheese!  He was so angry he refused a remake.  I ate my burger quickly and we left.  The waiter did deduct the cheese covered burger from the bill as we requested since it was uneatable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-medford
Jon K.,"Central Point, OR",0,7,,1.0,1/14/2018,"This establishment has become a subpar chucky cheese millennial hiring factory. The waiters/ waitresses are completely fixated on getting done with they're shift, rather than servicing customers properly. I haven't been here in 2 years because of the poor service and seems as though nothing has changed. I will not recommend this establishment to anyone I know in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-medford
Robert L.,"Beaverton, OR",2,46,18,2.0,1/1/2018,So sub par for a Red Robin. Service is extremely slow. Still waiting for the bill. Food took a really long time to get out. It was good when it arrived.

Lauren S.,"Anchorage, AK",0,6,,3.0,1/9/2018,"3/4 burgers we had tonight were good, but when I brought home a salmon burger to my wife when she got off work, we opened it to find a very badly freezer burned piece of farmed fish. I know, farmed fish is to be expected at a chain restaurant, but this barely passed for fish. She couldn't even eat the burger it was so bad, ate the fries and trashed the sandwich.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-medford
Liz R.,"San Diego, CA",81,59,391,2.0,7/1/2017,"Was not a fan of this place. My husband and I  eat at Red Robins all the time, we stopped at this location while on vacation because it was close to our hotel. If we are ever in the area again we are not coming back here.  The restaurant itself is dated the booth we sat at had tears in the seats and the backs were frayed and dirty looking (the cloth looked OLD like it hadn't been cleaned in years). The decor and carpert looked old/dirty.  The service was below average our server abandoned us, my husband's order was wrong, and we asked for more bottomless fries we were brought old/bad fries and we had to keep reminding him we were waiting for more fries.

Lindsey A.,"Medford, OR",2,10,24,2.0,6/29/2017,"My boyfriend and I came here last weekend because we had a craving for fries. Upon walking in we were told it would be a bit of a wait for a table, which was odd since it didn't seem too busy. After a few minutes, we were seated in what he and I agree was the worst table in the place. It was literally right next to the kitchen and a table full of fussy kids. Something was off on the table or seats because we were very far from the table and had to lean in close just to hear each other over the noise of the place. And like we had thought, it wasn't busy at all.  The food was alright. My boyfriend asked the waiter about a particular burger and was told it was just a bigger version of the one I wanted. When we got them, mine was significantly bigger for $2 less. We were both confused. Fries were good, but fries are always good.  We probably won't come back unless we just order fries, honestly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-medford

Carl M.,"Central Point, OR",0,9,,1.0,4/7/2017,Usually great but tonight I was totally disappointed. Arrived at about 4:40 PM and it was quiet. I ordered 1 cocktail & water but it took 10 minutes to receive them. Onion soup appetizer was also slow to arrive and only luke warm. Asked for more broth and was told that we'd be charged for another soup! We clearly requested extra crispy steak fries because they're usually limp and under cooked. The request was apparently ignored. We asked to re-do them and got two more orders of the same thing! Another food server that overheard our request brought another basket of crispy fries seconds later and asked if these were better.....and they were far better. We left an hour and ten minutes later. I asked for a comment card and was given a post it note...I'm calling the manager later to make sure he or she received my comments. They DID adjust our tab but tonight was NOT a stellar night for Red Robin.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-medford

He said he'd be right back and never materialized. Once our server realized we were impatient she came and checked on us again and finally brought us those extra fries about 20 minutes after our first food arrived. It seems like she was the only one working all the tables in the bar section.

Johnathan J.,"San Diego, CA",45,17,1,1.0,6/6/2017,Upon walking in I was warmly greater and told it would be about 10 minutes until we were seated. It was 9 minutes. We ordered the onion ring mountain and dipping sauce which was very good. We waited about 40 minutes for our food. The cod and shrimp was good but the fries were not hot. My daughter got the child's pepperoni pizza which she did not like. It was on a French roll and a little doughy. My peppercorn burger was quite underwhelming. I asked for no pink and had pink. The bread did not feel fresh and the burger was overwhelmed with soggy onion strings. The bacon was not crispy and small. The baked salmon was dry and tough to finish. We did have drink refills but no bottomless fries were offered which was a good thing because they were cold. Not a great experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-medford

Jim C.,"Gasquet, CA",0,5,3,1.0,8/22/2016,I went there today for lunch thinking I would get a great burger. I was highly disappointed with their burgers. I ordered the peppercorn bacon and cheeseburger. The burger was fairly dry as the patty  was overcooked. The peppercorn bacon was so thin you could see thru it; reminded me of the bacon you get at a Denny's. The drinks although you could have refills were $4.99 way overpriced. I would not recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a great burger for a decent price. You would be better off going on down the road to the In-n-out; they make a good burger and they down screw it up with some cheap ass pre-cooked bacon...just saying,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-medford
Kim C.,"Gladstone, OR",66,2,,1.0,2/8/2017,This is probably the worst Red Robin I've been to! It seemed very under staffed.

Steve M.,"Medford, OR",0,4,,1.0,12/8/2016,My wife and I moved from Portland and love Red Robin. However when we went to the Medford location we were sorely disappointed.  1. The greeters were young ladies who looked like they were barely 12 years old. They were playing with their phones while we stood there for like 3 min or more. When we were finally seated we were close to the door and could hear them talking about personal matters lol.  2. The restaurant was dirty. Trash all over the floor. 3. It took 15 min to get a drink and when I received it finally it was very watered down and had almost no alcohol in it. 4. The waitress looked pissed off all the time.  5. The burger I had was missing a piece of cheese  Worst Red Robin experience ever. Needless to say I will not be going back.

Jim B.,"Selma, OR",0,2,,5.0,8/21/2017,"I think most people post a review because of a memorable experience and I am no exception. I am an ex server so I pay a lot of attention to the service. I am well aware that it is both an art and a learned skill to manage to be there when needed without hovering or interrupting, especially when things get really busy. The young woman, Jamie, who was our server did a truly exceptional job! The food was typical Red Robin, good but not great, for example a burger and a shake from Smashburger are both better for around half the price.

Charlotte C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,18,6,1.0,6/9/2016,"Very sad about my experience today. I went to order my usual, that I've been having for years and was sadly disappointed when told the ingredients in it have changed. Seeing that I wouldn't like the new edition, I ordered the California chicken sandwich. It arrived and the chicken was almost raw. Sent it back. Without being asked anything I was brought another one, which at that point I wanted nothing to do with. I changed my order yet again and went with a garden burger (something you can't mess up) and it came incorrectly. Annoyed by the situation I just ate it anyway, seeing as how my party was already done and had been for some time now. I was offered a free sundae for the inconvenience yet still charged.  My issue isn't paying for my meal. My issue is they served me raw chicken and didn't offer to comp my meal. Raw chicken.

She nicely gave me a nickel to make it an even $10.  She blew it when she gave me back a $10 bill in an obvious attempt to receive it back for an inflated tip.

My husband forgot his wallet (we are both in our 30's) so the waiter quickly said ""YOU CANT SIT HERE"", like we were criminals?! That Message was clear so we moved down to the restaurant were we waited 5 minutes to be greeted from the new waitress. When she finally did we got an attitude from the her!

I had visions of awful- but then Emily came and introduced herself and let me know she knew we were here. She took our order, got our aps to us and entree and burger came in under 30 minutes.

Jon T.,"Central Point, OR",291,55,29,2.0,12/7/2014,"Red with regret; the story of Red Robin will be remembered as 'Lord of the Forgotten Tables'. A chain with mid-level family friendly ""card carrying"" charm, has broken our burger hearts for the last time.  Digs: If you are one of the few that have never entered the gates of RR imagine jammed walls of photos and paintings capturing the safe pop-art Americana closely tied to an Applebee's decor but not tapping into the local team sports memorabilia; the interior has not varied or changed in the 10+ years I've grazed their menu; Ate: Teriyaki ""Bonsai"" Burger - when our food finally arrived after a healthy 25min wait, it was a full-flavored, hardy pile of pineapple flavor, sauces, meat trimmings; it's my go-to; no negativity from my menu choice; Bottom-less Fries - steak fries, salted and crisp; it's the staple and survival (flashing back to my college years in Spokane, saving $ for endless RR fries); honestly nothing great but standard craving averted; Service: This is where the stars fell...fast. The staff became allusive almost frightened by feeding the scary rush of business lunch; (cue ghostly howls); we were greeted kindly but then neglected from ordering to the final payment; each step seemed grueling; two of party members had to literally track down the waitress to pay then receive our checks back to finally sign; I kept recalling the hordes of sorority girls flocking to fries in 15+ groups and waiters drowning them in sugary slurps of alcohol and baskets of fun, but this location crashed in an oily fire; Overall: Red Robin can maintain a tolerable menu but their service crumbles with neglect. I love a 2-hour lunch but not when it's due to the overwhelmed waitstaff. From ordering, to plating, to paying it stretched to the point of insult. Most at the table worked for the service industry and understand the madness but it surpassed our patience. Medford has other meaty options that deserve our money and time. This will be my last bottom-less fry basket.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-medford?start=40

I had the fries, chicken tenders, and riblets, and the fries were great, the chicken was ok, and the riblets were....meh.  I think I should have stuck with my gut and ordered a burger.  Their flavored lemonade was bottomless, however, and that was probably the best part.  My mom got a wrap and she said it was good, but not great.  Once again, 3 stars.

And the kids played games while the adults talked, so the time went fast. And yes, it is very loud there, and yes, they really do sing for people's birthdays so fair warning, if that will bother you. The food was good, burgers fresh, all cooked to order as desired and the fries were fresh and hot, yet cooked properly, not rushed out, undercooked. The wait for food was shorter than we expected given the crowd. Our waiter was very attentive and kept great eye contact (being funny) with the kids as he was moving around the tables to keep them entertained while waiting. Really nice guy. Wish we had one like this close to home, but alas, our local place closed some years ago. The style did not play well in my hometown but it sure does in Medford.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-medford?start=40

Jennifer L.,"Central Point, OR",5,16,16,2.0,3/19/2015,"This place is going down hill...fast. My number 1 issue is the fact that for the SECOND time my server almost forgot to sing my child happy birthday.  This actually happened to us last year and I wasn't about to let it happen again so I reminded them as they were basically pushing us out the door. She said that she forgot and promptly got the group together to sing. These things you should make note of and remember.   I ordered a Whiskey River BBQ burger...it was dry...no BBQ sauce to be found. Really?! It's in the name people!  The service we got here reminded me of children without parents around.  I'm only guessing that because we went on a Wednesday night at 7pm that a main manager had already left and this is why no one was really doing what they were supposed to.  WHY isn't there ketchup on any of the tables anymore?! The whole table had fries and we were never even asked about ketchup.  WHY isn't there any sweeteners on the table? Why when I ordered my ICED TEA wasn't I asked if I needed it?  It's fine that you don't stock these at the table anymore, but when people order things that these items go with,  it needs to be offered. We shouldn't have to ask. EVER! Fries...not really endless anymore. You get ignored and really don't have a chance to ask for any more. When we finally got our servers attention she brought us out 2 baskets and expected our table to share them between us. No no no no!  Never. Going. Back. Again. You guys may still get business no matter what you dish out because you have no competition, but when in and out and 5 guys comes in to town you are going to have to step up your game.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-medford?start=40

Started with a monster-sized salted caramel shake. Comes with the metal tin for refills, so you get two shakes for the price of one. 'Merica!    The caramel flavor was fairly mild initially, but as I worked my way through the shake it got progressively saltier and caramelier as I went. Moved on to the Blue Cheese Burger. Good slab of beef, cooked just like I wanted. Blue cheese had just enough bite. Bun was tender and soft and flavorful. Toppings were juicy. Like all the burgers, it comes with unlimited steak fries. When you need to replace calories lost, or when you need to gain 10lbs in a hurry because you are too damn skinny, there is nothing quite as appealing as unlimited fried food. I went nom nom nom nom nom to my heart's content. Red Robin, if I was in you every day I would weigh 400lbs and my salivary glands would run dry.

Michelle C.,"Medford, OR",0,5,,3.0,1/20/2014,"I've gotta say this was one of my favorite places to eat, but standards have seemed to have slipped over the last year or so. The service to the table is spotty, you sometimes get a good server, sometimes not.  I'm not sure if it's because we tend to go before or after the crowds but the fry refills always seem cold and stale, when they eventually get back to your table. My two favorite burgers to get there (the pub and the shroom) have since become somewhat tasteless. I have also found that when you say ""well done"" the burger typically comes a bit more chard and dry, then juicy and cooked through. The burgers themselves have little flavor and in the case of the shroom burger, the toppings aren't flavored either. Its like the mushrooms were just left to soak in warm grease and cheese was melted on top.

I was driving and decided to stop here because my mom kept saying ""fries"" and I recalled Red Robin having good fries. I was surprised to find out that they carry the Boca vegan burger now! Hooray! Instead of fries, they allow you to substitute steamed broccoli (or any of a number of alternatives) for little to no additional charge. My vegan veggie burger was tasty with a spicy mustard and the broccoli made me feel less guilty. My mom and sister split a BLT on a croissant which they raved about.  My only complaint is that I ran out of water very quickly and it was never refilled. I understand that it was 9pm on a Thursday night and they were shutting down, but I specifically mentioned I'd need a lot of water. Small potatoes though.

Dick H.,"Brentwood, CA",5,260,3,2.0,3/15/2013,"Once again, a ZERO for ""service"" and a 4 for food. I ordered French Onion soup and a salad with my burger.  One would expect the soup and salad may come out before, no? Nope.  Two plates all at the same time, so the table had no room. For the THIRD time (do I never learn??), the bottomless fries weren't.  I asked twice to get fries refilled.  And drinks, and water. Too bad. The food is consistently good, but so overpowered by the consistently poor service.  The greeters are nice and helpful, holding the door opened, promptly seating us etc., but good grief, is it that hard to serve salads before the burger, and to maybe ask if I'd like more fries, water, drink, etc.??? I guess it is. Third time, why go back?  Other places have good food too, but few have service this bad. My dining partner had the Irish Beer shake.  WOW!  Delicious!   Too bad.  I doubt I'd go back to this one.  Other Red Robins do much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-medford?start=80
Bob N.,"Medford, OR",41,2,,1.0,9/7/2012,"Hey there Medford Red Robin!!! Let me tell you why I will never return to your location. Let's start it off with a 2-minute wait at the front door, a manager suggesting a 6 top sit at the bar when he finally came out. Hmm.. Okay. We sat down in the lower section by the drink station. Our server didn't come to the table for 10 minutes because ""she wasn't told she got a table sat"". Um. Shouldn't you keep an eye on your section to begin with? Our drinks took over 5 mins, because for some reason she had to go to another drink station besides the one we were literally right next to? Two in our party ordered the new ""Oktoberfest Burger"" which according to our email said royalty members could get a sneak preview of and clearly the staff had no idea about this, except one server who said you did have all that was needed to make the burger. My grandmother ordered a diet pepsi, and it was flat and mixed with rootbeer. The manager ""Billy"" said there was nothing he could do to fix it. Word for word. When it could have been as simple as, ""I'm sorry, our diet isn't working tonight, I would love to get you something else"" as opposed to making unnecessary excuses as to how he had no control. Twenty-five minutes later our food arrived. My entree as well as all three burgers we ordered was cold. The ""Oktoberfest""s were missing some of the ingredients. The chicken sandwich we ordered was barely warm. When Billy returned, he said, ""There's no way I can make you happy."" And my fiancé stated that by saying that he was already giving up, and he was cutting off communication. To which this manager said he was disrespecting him and he needed to leave. Absolutely in no way was he being disrespectful, he was trying to help the manager better this really terrible situation.  Our server was ""DD"", minus her mistake of letting us sit for 10 minutes, she was lovely. This manager though, ruined everything. My grandmother had literally just flown in after a long flight and this was the disservice we received. Billy is ill equipped to problem solve and communicate. Things can go wrong at a restaurant, but show heart and try to mend things and simply be nice and give good service and we could have left happy full customers. Instead, you have lost a customer; we spent our money at Applebee's, who had impeccable service by the way. We were greeted once we got in the door, sat right away, and received our food and drinks with a smile and in a timely manner. And this is a reoccurring event; in the last couple years (mind you we go for the food not the terrible service you consistently provide) I have had a hair on my plate, a big black long one that came with no apology to my oblivious server. Another time we had a server never once ask us how our food was, I had to go to the bar for a refill of water, she also entirely forgot our appetizer, and when the expo brought our entrees out and I mentioned we were supposed to have a starter, she didn't say or do anything. Our server spent more time gossiping and flirting with her coworkers than she did talking to us. When I spoke to the manager (again Billy) I informed him of her poor service, to which he replied (word for word), ""I can talk to her, but I can't guarantee that it will do any good."" Are you freaking kidding me? Don't you pay people to do their job? And if she's not doing her job, why the heck are you letting her work?  So thank you, for ruining one of my favorite places to eat. You won't see us in there again. 301395 Reference number for corporate. Only reason why you have 1 star is because I have to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-medford?start=80
Lux L.,"Portland, OR",13,29,,2.0,8/28/2012,"Ok. Let's begin by saying: I'm not a fan of chains. When I was younger, I LOVED going to Red Robin for the milkshakes and the endless fries. But this was before I understood the ramifications of where you put your money. I'm not going to launch into some political rant here, don't worry. But I will say that I am much happier giving my money and my business to a locally-owned, family restaurant than I am a major chain with 5,000 restaurants nationwide. Chances are, they don't need the cash from me. Furthermore, what scares me a little bit about chains is that they have this menu that every single restaurant adheres to. There are no gourmet chefs in the kitchen, or even a mom-and-pop style cook who has labored over his or her recipes for years to perfect them. This rings true for me every time I have been to Red Robin as an adult: the food is average to poor, the service is mediocre, and the atmosphere is cookie-cutter.  But I think the thing that bothers me the most about this place is that they use non-recyclable, plastic dixie cups for EVERY SINGLE dip, dressing, and condiment. Want more ranch dressing for your fries? Generate 4 more dixie cups of waste. If this is true for every Red Robin in the US, think about how much waste is being generated every day, just by those red plastic dixie cups.  Well, now that I've sounded like a hippy though this whole post, I'm gonna go hug some trees or something.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-medford?start=80

There were three plus a highchair and he was very upbeat, prompt, patient and attentive.  We didn't have to ask for refills, extra fries, etc. he just predicted it, he was very good. Even toward the end of our meal, the place started filling up fast and he was being seated quickly, he still maintained a great attitude and attentivness to us, which we really appreciated. The food, all burgers, were also great. Piping hot out the door, juicy and thick. Plus they didn't skimp on the fries or dressings!

Misty J.,"Portland, OR",18,129,1,3.0,10/19/2011,"Being a large chain and very generic, I normally wouldn't give this place a review because, really, no one is going to Yelp Red Robin before they go there. However, we had a dining experience last night that I feel definitely deserves some time in the Yelp spotlight. I'll explain why in a minute. My daughter and I were visiting my parents last night, and they offered to take us to dinner. The little one chose Red Robin (she LOVES their burgers), so off we went. When we got inside, we were greeted and seated by a VERY sweet and professional hostess. Pleasant surprise #1. Then, our server came and took our drink and appetizer orders, then came back a few minutes later to take our entree orders. 9 times out of 10, I get their patty melt with extra thousand island on the side (I just loooove patty melts), and every single time, I have to ask for the thousand island again after I'm served. Not last night! I know it seems insignificant, but I really, really appreciated that. Pleasant surprise #2. She came back and checked on us an appropriate number of times without seeming pushy. Pleasant surprise #3. No problems with the check, all in all an unexpectedly nice experience for a busy chain restaurant. Pleasant surprise #4. I didn't get the server's name, but she was a petite blonde girl with star tattoos on the back of her neck/behind her ear. If you go there, describe her and ask to be seated in her section. Trust me, it's worth it. She's very good at her job. These days, people just don't want to do their jobs (and I'm not just talking about government employees). People don't feel the need to provide excellent customer service, and they don't care if you're satisfied or not. It's all about numbers, money, and making room for the next customer. Service is often hurried, and most of the time, attention is not paid to specific requests. Call me picky, but that ANNOYS me. I started working at a cosmetics counter when I was 16; I was very thoroughly trained and expected to be courteous, professional and attentive. I was expected to come to work with a full face of makeup, impeccable hair, pressed clothing with colors that were appropriate for the season, clean nails, and clean shoes. I guess you can say that I'm old school. So whenever I come across someone who actually does their job and does it well, I am very, very grateful. The hostess and server are very deserving of glowing reviews, and I can only hope that they or their boss sees this and knows who I am referring to. They were awesome :) Oh, the food is standard, what you'd expect. Greasy, salty, fatty, chain restaurant goodness. Nothing fancy, just good for those nights you don't want to cook :) BUT, honestly, as far as food goes, this place would not be my first choice, only because I am not used to eating such heavy fare. However, I'll deal with a bit of bubble guts if that means I don't get pissed off by the serving staff :P",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-medford?start=100

The bottomless fries are usually brown, luke warm, and simply nasty as if they've been sitting under the warmer far too long.  We've always loved Red Robin, until we moved here.  If you are from another town and get excited to see Red Robin, keep going because this will not meet your expectations.

I got the feeling the waitresses we've had seem to not want to give refills or offer more fries. Everytime I've been there you have to ask them every single time and they do not impress. It is not like we ask for order after order of fries and drinks, usually just one extra.

Elisa A.,"Ashland, OR",23,113,20,2.0,2/23/2011,"Gah. What can I say? I tried Red Robin for the first time about a year and a half ago in Portland and was hooked. I have been a vegetarian for many years and finding out they offered veggie burger substitutions for all their gourmet burgers, I knew I would love it. And I did, for a long time, it became our destination for date night. But after moving to Medford, I have changed my mind considerably.  This is by far the worst red robin I've ever been to. The waitstaff is lousy and because of that, the service is unbearable. They can NEVER get an order right, EVER. Food is always either overcooked or undercooked and the qualities I loved about Red Robin elsewhere, seem to be lacking completely. One time they brought us two huge, steaming BEEF burgers, when we had ordered veggie! This was after a 30-40 minute wait and they had to take them back and make them veggie and when they brought those back, they were so overcooked we couldn't bite into them! I have left Red Robin every time except once feeling nauseated, with a headache from all the screaming kids, obnoxious music and bright lights everywhere. I am giving it 3 stars because we decided to give them one more chance (I'm telling you, we LOVED Red Robin in Portland) this weekend and they redeemed themselves enough to bring us back again. I've recently started eating chicken so I tried the buffalo chicken tenders, we sat in the bar area (which we didn't know we could do, we were never offered) and the service was quick, friendly and the food was great. So if you are over 21, sit in the bar area. Make sure you stress you're a vegetarian if you are and don't expect quick service, make sure you're not completely starving or in a hurry because you will wait and wait and wait. Try the campfire sauce! ********* July 2nd, 2011  I have to edit this. We went today for lunch and the bar area was full. What a mistake not waiting or just sitting side by side! They sat us in a dirty booth and I touched something sticky and freaked out. I had the waitress come back with a wet rag and she asked if we wanted to move to another table, which was dirtier than the one we were already at! Then she said (with a very snarky attitude) ""Do you want me to leave this rag with you?"" NO BITCH! I DON'T WANT YOUR SICK RAG. I JUST WANT TO BE SAT AT A CLEAN TABLE! Then they sat a family with 4 kids (ahhhhhhhhhhh) on one side of us and two idiotic teenager girls on the other side. I haven't eaten so fast in my life, in anticipation of just getting the hell out of there. What a nightmare. I know it's cool to have ""family friendly"" restaurants but clean your shit! I was so appalled by the condition of this place that when we do go back (boyfriend LOVES the food, ugh) we will never EVER not sit in the bar area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-medford?start=100

So, I gave in even though the menu was so not veggie friendly.  Paul was so excited, it was cute actually.  I saw this delicious sounding southwestern type salad on the menu that normally comes with chicken but they were more than happy to give me lots of extra veggies and beans in lieu of the chicken.  Boy oh boy was that salad delicious, it was seriously fantastic.  It was just chock full of fresh veggies and beans.  So good. Paul got this gigantic burger, the five alarm burger or something like that.  He was so excited.  I will admit that I was slightly excited about the bottomless fries that came with it, that was a nice way to kill my healthy meal.  They give you a choice of dipping sauces, you know, because fries are super healthy anyway.   So, that is the story of why a vegetarian is giving Red Robin four stars.  A very delicious southwestern salad and bottomless fries.
