D J.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",1,18,37,2.0,8/12/2017,"I come here alot. So its pretty disappointing to receive sub par service time and time again. This is probably the 5th time I have had less than satisfactory service at this location but I have no choice because the only other location in my area is just as terrible. So I deal with it because overall I like the food. Today was like no other the staff seemed overwhelmed and my server seemed frantic. Because of this I asked to be moved out of the bar area (epitome of poor service dont sit at the bar!). Once in a regular seating area our waitress brought us someone else's food whoops. We let her know and after a short time our food arrives. Food mediocre at best this time which is unfortunate because even though they have poor service the food is usually good. I have a mountain of mayo on my burger (see pics) and my gf food is luke warm and the avocado still had seeds in it. Because it will take an eternity to get our food fixed and lets face it I always worry about getting my food spit in when I send it back, I decide to modify my food and press on. She does the same. Im going to avoid this location for awhile. Its always poor but today was exceptionally poor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-menifee?start=20
Felix L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1021,558,15580,2.0,6/21/2015,"The host showed me a table immediately after I walked in and handed me a very descriptive menu that was full of pictures. She sat me near two large TVs broadcasting live sports. It was a great start, before the rest of the experience went downhill. I ordered the bleu ribbon burger and a chicken tortilla soup. The server hand-wrote my order on a partitioned section of her booklet, which felt very old fashion. This restaurant does not have a modern tablet ordering system that I noticed from another Red Robin location. The interactive tablet allows customers to place orders, request refills, and pay without the presence of wait-staff. Chicken tortilla soup arrived first, and it was the worst I've ever had of this type. Watery, filled with frozen corn but lacking main ingredients such as chicken and avocado, the cheese was not grated thin enough for me, overloaded with sour cream, and the fried tortilla strips were completely flat at arrival without any crunch. Not to mention the price, $3.29 for about 6oz of soup, is even higher than what Whole Food charges. The bleu ribbon burger was decently executed although the combination of ingredients was not very imaginative. This burger is supposed to be unique from other Red Robin burgers by including a beef patty that is rubbed in steak sauce, and then topped with crumbled bleu cheese and crispy fried onion shreds. Meh. I thought that the sweetness of the chipotle aioli overpowered the taste of the patty. Also for some reason, I just couldn't really taste the distinct bitterness of bleu cheese. Furthermore, My burger must be covered with butter because I had a heavy feeling in my stomach after consumption. Sweet potato fries, included with the burger, are refillable and this is supposed to be the signature point at Red Robin. However, it meant nothing since service was nearly non-existent. Like many All-American chain restaurants, one server was responsible for an area of the restaurant. My server was either inefficient or assigned to way too many tables, because every time I wanted to make a request, she was either scrambling around the kitchen, loading up trays, or busy taking orders. I finished my burger and then waited 15 to 20 more minutes just for my first refill of fries. In my opinion, Slater's 50/50 outperforms this chain with perfunctory service, use of innovative seasonal ingredients, and high level of customization.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-menifee?start=20

David B.,"Colton, CA",1,5,3,3.0,1/1/2017,"I don't know about coming to Red Robin again after this night out with the family.  Hospitality is a gift some have, some can learn and others don't care to use.  Our hostess was great and assured us we would be cared for.  Miranda did not introduce herself or take any interest in our reason for being at Red Robin. From that moment I knew it might be a great night or a whatever experience.  I ordered the wedgie burger and it was great! I was a little thrown to see it didn't have a bun ,but it was delicious. All the other meals ordered were very good as well.  Usually when food is brought out you would like silverware and a few napkins to get down to business . We had to ask for that from another waitress who was helping out. The garlic ""herb"" fries were not anything to scream about I would just stick to the regular fries if you do go here .  I can't say I would recommend this place unless you're hungry and the other restaurants around have hour long waits or you enjoy friendly host's! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-menifee?start=20

Jim W.,"Menifee, CA",0,3,,3.0,5/31/2017,"Great burger and beer bar - if you stick to the burgers and beer, or any other drinks. My wife decided to have a soup as well, and chose the French Onion. It came with a huge glob of cheese melting thru the soup, and sticking to the spoon when she tried to remove it. Disgusting! I know Americans like cheese on almost anything, but really..... in the soup? I bet the French would not want to be associated with this item. This cost you some stars, the burgers were fine, the beer was good too.

Sandra A.,"Allen, TX",20,17,6,1.0,9/5/2015,"We decided to stop at Red Robin for lunch. My mom and I had salads and my daughter and youngest son had the mac and chesse and my other son had the kids pizza. The servers brought out our salads and the mac and cheese.  The server stated that the pizza would be right out. Needless to say everyone had finished their food and my soon still was without his pizza 20 min later. Finally our server came back to our table and I let him know my son  had not received his pizza.  He goes to the kitchen and comes back with my son's pizza. By the time my son received his food, it was cold. Instead of my son eating his pizza there he decided to box it up and take it with him. As he's  eating his pizza in the car he screams out saying he just bit into something hard. He pits it out and it looks like bone.

Dave C.,"SAN PEDRO, CA",13,34,96,3.0,1/12/2018,"Red Robin has always been one of my favorite restaurants. That being said, lately I feel as if the food is a hit and miss. There have been times where my burger is delicious, and others to where I wonder what happened.  The service at this particular location has always been excellent. We've never had an issue with being seated at a decent time, even if it's busy. The table service has also always been great. It just comes down to the food. On this past visit, my California chicken burger was a little dry and the bread was hard, almost as if it was old. My kids and wife's food looked great. No one else had any issues.  The bottomless fries kept coming and like I've mentioned, our waitress was very attentive and would fill up our drinks and fries, lol.

Its all about that one gesture that you will forever remember. Sad so sad.  I would of been glad to of paid for the ballon.  If those balloons were not meant for the kids then don't blow them up where everyone can see them.  Do it out back I need to say that there must of been over 20 balloons and still blowing up more..Hope she sleeps well tonight after seeing our grandsons little sad face.  He is not that kid that throws fits he just sensed her meanness and walked away.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-menifee

Erica P.,"Sun City, CA",0,16,,1.0,1/5/2018,"Incredibly Bad Service Not only did it take the restaurant 55 minutes to seat a party of 6, I was given 30 - 40 minutes, and it took almost 15 minutes for 5 of our party to get their drinks, two people in the party received an appetizer and ate it before the rest of us got our drinks.  The icing on the cake was when people seated after us, got their drinks and their food before we did.  When I spoke to the manager upon leaving, he made jokes, like he really didn't care about us.  There was also bits of bone or something white and hard in my burger.  I won't ever return to this or any other Red Robin since it is obvious that this chain really doesn't care about their patrons.  Next time I crave a burger I'll go to Five Guys.

Not one hidden by bread and fixings, but a burger good enough to stand alone with a bun, so you could taste the meat, pink inside and tender, grill marks from open flame grilling. The whole bit. Red Robin hit a home run with their very simple burger, a tavern bun, decorated only by a few sesame seeds, pink inside and tasty as well as juicy. The chef didn't smash down this burger onto the grill. The server was prompt and efficient and knew her menu, which was extensive. My burger came with fries and all the usual decorations on the side, perfect! That allows me to add pickles if I choose or simply eat them solo. Unlimited steak fries of course.

My daughter was impressed with the television in the floor by the waiting area.  We weren't that hungry, so we skipped the appetizer, but I got the raspberry lime soda while my husband got an arnold palmer (hey, that's my drink!)  We got my daughter the kids grilled cheese with a side of broccoli and she ate more of the broccoli than the burger (my girl loves her broccoli). I ordered the Royal Red Robin Burger which had an egg on it, it was really good, but messy. Boy are the big too! I could barely finish my burger! I also swapped out the fries for sweet potato fries instead. Which were also really good. They gave us two options for ketchup dipping to go with it.  My husband got the Whiskey River BBQ burger and he really enjoyed his as well, but like I said, the portions are big so we didn't finish our burgers and were too full to take advantage of the bottomless drinks. The fries are bottomless too, but we didn't get to take advantage of that.

Nothing really horrible but also nothing great either. Since the new management took over the service has been consistently bad. Long waits for food and service of any kind are commonplace here now. When you do get service it's subpar.  The last time I was there, four of the people in my party had to send their food back TWICE because the burgers were raw and cold in the middle. This time our food was cooked just fine but it took 28 minutes to come out then one of the orders was wrong. Nothing was special. The old garlic fries were amazing, these new ones are just fries with garlic and way too salty. No refills on those and they cost extra. Our refills on the regular fries came out at the end of our meal when everyone was almost finished. Anything gluten free also costs extra. Burgers tasted okay but nothing special.  The freckled lemonade is still amazing!   One adult and two children (no alcohol and one water as a drink, no appetizers or dessert) cost $44. Mediocre food, poor, very slow service and on the expensive side for what you get.

They gave us like maybe 10 little pickles!! RIP OFF! We got fries to tide us over from starvation before our meals came. Requested a refill on fries but apparently the waitress decided we didn't need them since she never brought more. When our meals finally came my daughters egg on her burger wasn't fully cooked even though we requested it to be and they put mayo on my sandwich which I asked not to be put on it. The waitress was apologetic and corrected both mistakes but I really think waitresses need to check there tickets to the orders before they just bring them to the tables. (We just had ice tea and soda so no reviews on the drinks.) My BLTA sandwich was great, I had no mayo or tomato and I added slices of cucumber on the side to put on the sandwich. It was really yummy!!!

Never said sorry or do you want me to get you another plate. My hamburger was cold. I had about 8 fries in my little bucket that they say is bottomless.  We were never asked again if we needed anything. I know that there's a button on the table if I need to call the waitress but what happened to asking if everything is all right or do we need anything else with out being electronically called. We did have the pleasure of our waitress's big butt in our faces every time she leaned over to talk with the elderly group in the next table. We paid 40 dollars for this and then they wanted to tell us how much we should tip her. I tip because the food and server were good.

He was disappointed that it wasn't bigger for an $11 burger. He also got the endless rootbeer float.

The Bleu Ribbon burger was good but the real reason for 4 star was that they had a local craft beer on tap Black Market Hefeweizen which was reasonable in price and ""very"" good with the lemon and orange. This location was busy yet still provided friendly service. I've been here before but Menifee Red Robin has improved since!

Melissa D.,"Corona, CA",46,38,24,4.0,8/27/2015,Went in for an early lunch right as they had opened for the day. We were promptly greeted and given a table. Our waitress Sharon was great. Very attentive and offered some recommendations and let us know about changes they had made to our favorite side (garlic fries) which were still as delicious as before. Food was great and perfectly cooked. It was a bit cold at our particular booth as the a/c was blowing directly on us but I'd rather be too cold than uncomfortably warm.

Laura A.,"Quail Valley, CA",35,13,,2.0,6/8/2015,I gave this restaurant two stars for the quality of the food only. Since the change in management customer service has always been consistently bad. As a former server I always analyze and assess the servers situation to understand the amazingly SLOW waits. Average is 10-15 minutes just to get drinks and always by the hostess...and more often than not the staff is so frazzled they forget half the items we request. It is blatantly apparent a skeleton crew is present....even when it's not very busy the servers are struggling...makes me wonder if management is straining their labor budget to bonus. After today's visit it's safe to say we won't be back. Every visit in 2015 has been terrible...to say the least.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-menifee?start=80

When we flagged her down and told her it was wrong, she gave us attitude to take them back. We received no napkins, empty glasses left on our table the whole time, and just plain rude.

michelle c.,"Corona, CA",1,11,,2.0,10/25/2015,"I'm normally super happy going to Red Robin but this time.. not so much. I was greeted by I'm assuming the manager on duty considering she was dressed differently from  everyone else. She wasn't so happy or pleasant to speak to since there was no ""hello"" or smile, just ""how many and your name?"". That didn't really bother me.  What bothered me the most was after a 15-20 min wait people that came after me were being seated. I mean I get it, it's a busy day and you have a lot of people but considering that my party was only 2 people I figured that it'll be easy; offer the bar or something. So after a party of 2 that came after me were asked if they were over 21 and they would be seated before me, I was pretty mad. I went up to the hostess booth and was told that they were getting a table but they had to seat a table of 6 which by the way came after me. After being called we were seated in the way back corner next to the bathrooms.  The server was very mediocre, nothing special. She did her job and was able to give me a glimpse of hope for my meal. I didn't want the experience with the ""hostess"" hinder my experience with the server (hence the 2 stars rather than 1 star).  Needless to say, my first interaction with the first person that works at this specific restaurant molded my impression of the whole business.

We sat right next to the line so I could see that my food was up and ready to send out, yet it took 10 minutes (I actually timed it) for it to hit our table. Then instantly our meals came out. Our server came by only once. The busser was the one who came by and asked if I wanted a refill in my iced tea. I don't know if they were understaffed or what, but it was terrible service.

Cristine P.,"Menifee, CA",113,113,25,4.0,2/9/2014,"Went to Red Robin's on Saturday night & quickly got a booth at the bar. At first we put our names on the waiting list and were expecting to wait 20 minutes but because we looked at the (seat yourself) bar seating, we got served right away! Nice!  What was even MORE awesome was that not only was the service superb, the bar area was ages 21 and over and that rule was abided by! It's great to be able to be in an adult environment sometimes and not be near a bunch of loud children when you would rather enjoy some peace and quiet. I wish more restaurants offered this option.  There was a good selection of beers including Stone IPA and Blue Moon. The soft drinks were bottomless and so were the deliciously-seasoned French fries. The fries didn't taste frozen either which is a plus because most restaurant fries taste freezer-burned unless fresh.  Our food was prepared as we requested. I had a concern with something of mine and it was immediately replaced. I felt no guilt because they truly made me feel good about being a patron! They supplied my messy self many napkins and refilled our drinks.  Overall it was a great place! If I could press anything it would be that the front staff seemed a little scattered maybe because there wasn't exactly a podium (which made me feel awkward.) Also, I would like to add that whomever I guessed to be the manager -- did walk around but never actually interacted with guests. The assumed manager was very quiet and mostly just talked to the employees -- I think it would have been a better experience if the manager would have interacted with guests. You never know how their day is going so I'm not upset or anything it's just a note.  I'd go again and definitely sit in the bar area! In fact, I'd wait for the bar area just for the no kids rule.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-menifee?start=100

The other three were all relatively the same in comparison with each other. All times food was very slow to come out and all three times something was cold and incorrect in my party's order. All three times service was very poor (no check backs, you have to flag another server for refills and don't even bother trying to ask for condiments or more fries).

Tonight, my wife and I went in at about 7:45.  The restaurant was only half full, so not particularly busy by any standard.  We were promptly seated and . . . and . . . and . . . well suffice to say that is where the wheels came off.  A waitress finally came by after about ten minutes and said she would be right with us.  After another 10 minutes or so, she came by again, and repeated, ""I will be right with you.""  A few minutes later, we were told again she would be right with us.  On her fourth visit and proclamation she'd be right with us, we got up and left.

Maybe it's because it's the only new sit down restaurant in this small town.  Maybe it's because my daughter, Robyn, likes to say the name.  Or maybe it's because the burgers are DAMN FRIGGIN' GOOD! Yeah, I'll pay $6 for a burger, Mr. Carls Jr.!!  Shit, it's about 9 bucks for a burger here but I think it's worth it.  The Blue Ribbon and A1 Peppercorn burgers are bomb-diggy.  What's more, there's a full bar to order some alcohol to wash it down!  Beer and burgers?  Sounds good to me. I do think that they should give a lot more fries though, since it's all you can eat.  Yeah they are large strips but it looks pretty funny getting only 6-8 fries with your burger and then the same amount when you ask for more. But it's not that big a deal for me.  Try the Red Robin seasoning on the fries, btw. Kids meals are a good size.  The 2 of mine are small so splitting a pizza satisfies them both.  Wife enjoys the bottomless Freckled Lemonade with real strawberries.  What can I say? There's something to please every one of us. I feel I'm getting my money's worth here, especially with the free refills on many of the food.  Staff is friendly and they always take note they we order 1 menu item for both my kids to share.  So when the food arrives they separate the food evenly and place them in individual baskets so my kids don't end up fighting over who gets what.  Yeah I know it's a minor thing but hey, I appreciate the gesture nonetheless.

Actually I didn't have time since the food was all brought at different times and most were done with their dinner by the time I received mine. I needed an order to go as well but had to goto the bar to order it separately since we couldn't find out waitress. The hostess grab water for us since our server disappeared. I mentioned it to a manager and much like the first experience he didn't seem to care. He barely looked up and just said I am sorry about that. The leadership is a joke and the service from most is non-existent. I will not be back, and it's too bad cause I do like their food.

I take pride in Red Robin because it was my very first job... the one in Temecula, actually! I know what goes into what makes it special and YUMMY!! Even after working there, I still love to EAT there! Heck, I just love to eat!  I will say that upon walking in we were greeted with delight, and sat right away. It was quite busy for a Friday (Don't people work??!), but still in the manageable category of busy.  I had a CRAVING for a Blue Ribbon Burger, and because I'd never had it before, I figured , why not!!?? I've tried everything else on the menu!  But before I get into THAT yumminess, let's talk about the server...and the service. It was okay. I know right, after all that build up, you get ""okay."" Don't get me wrong, it wasn't horrible by any means, our server was mediocre. He didn't introduce himself with his name, but definitely welcomed us with a smile. I would have hoped for him to upsell their usual summer promotion, but he didn't do that. (We always had fun contests to entice us to upsell... just saying) A server should anticipate the next round of beverages, when they get low, and he did refill our waters without question. We only ordererd waters, and Dad ordered a Strawberry shake.  We ordered our food... the food arrived later than the 10 minutes they allow for entrees (Fun fact for you to take away: 8min appetizers). They probably took about 15-20 minutes to bring out our order. Nothing out of the ordinary, nothing special to customize the order... just three of their burgers...  My burgers definitly WoW's me... but only half fit in my belly.. the rest was dinner that night!  Nonetheless, we went to eat and accomplished our goal. The food is always tasty at Red RoBin, which is why I choose to continue to return.

It's not dry or texturally ""bread-y"" like most other turkey burgers are. Plus they have a chipotle sauce they use that is delicious.  They make excellent strawberry lemonade also.

We've gone to a few other restaurants & gotten passive-aggressive sass from waiters who were bummed that their tip might be lower because of it.  2) We never waited around for ANYTHING. Refills, questions, more fries, sauces, whatever. We just barely looked up and around and BAM! our waiter was there to get us whatever we needed.  3) Service from everyone has been top-notch. Hosts, servers, managers, bussers; everyone was glad to be working there it seemed.  We have inadvertently gone here to celebrate a few big occasions; closing escrow, our engagement dinner, our anniversary, etc. and each time has been amazing.

Here is another tip: Sign up for their burger club... cause every 10th burger is free, and you just have to use your card every time; it will automatically come right off the bill when you earn it or other perks.

It came out with lots of onions no onion straws and almost no guacamole at all. We ask them to fix it, and not only did they fix it quickly , the manager came right over to apologize. Then they took the cost of the burger off our bill. I didn't ask for them to do that nor did I expect it, but I really appreciated how they went out of their way to make us happy.
