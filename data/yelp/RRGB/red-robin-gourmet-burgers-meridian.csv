Joseph N.,"Nampa, ID",7,131,26,3.0,1/8/2018,I tell you what the last time stepped into a Red Robin was about a decade ago.. and that wasn't by choice. The food was always bad and the pricing always seemed a bit off.  Wow! What a change! I mean the interior looks a bit like a TGI Fridays but man they ain't fooling around with those burgers! I don't know what happened in the last decade but the food has seriously improved!   The service is always extremely nice and friendly at this location. The service is also really slow. It takes forever to get a beer or drink (may be a issue with the bar) and that really sets a bad precedent for the meal. When I sit down and give a drink order I should never EVER have to wait 10-15 or sometimes 20 minutes.. that's ridiculous.  All in all I love these burgers and I will frequent this and other local locations often.. but I may bring a flask haha!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-meridian
Bryan G.,"Meridian, ID",135,86,35,3.0,12/29/2017,For a Red Robin this specific location hits some speed bumps. I believe it's not part of the national chain and appears to be a franchise. This causes some issues as the training doesn't seem to be on par with most Red Robin locations. RR prides itself on stellar wait service with quick touch times and accurate ordering. For what ever reason this location seems much slower on getting to tables quick after you're sat.  The food is on par with most RR locations and will have some good days and bad days. I enjoy the royal burger here.  Expect to see a good amount of families here and a family friendly location,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-meridian
Ann R.,"Boise, ID",37,75,25,2.0,8/16/2017,"I went out tonight hoping for a nice dinner at one of my favorite burger joints. Walked in and no one greeted me. After I finally got seated it took about 10 minutes to even get acknowledged and then it was not my server, but at least someone came and asked me if I wanted something to drink. When my server finally arrived she apologized and told me that she had a bigger table that she was dealing with which is fine, I know you're busy. My is that the restaurant was 95% empty and it took so long to even be acknowledged.  She was pleasant, took my order and left. Sometime later she brought my salad and left. I saw her about 15 minutes later with my burger and she didn't ask me if I wanted another salad or anything. My drink tasted foul and I would have liked the opportunity to let her know  so that I can have water that was drinkable. She just dropped the food and left.  Never saw her again until it was time to pay. She never asked me if my food was okay, never asked me if I would like another dinner salad. Nothing. Nada. There were less than a dozen customers in the entire restaurant and bar. How is it that you can have at least 6 or more staff members out front and no one even bothered to look my way for so long. I realize that singles aren't as big a tip for you servers. We do give a higher percentage overall generally. And it would be really, really nice to be treated like we count as much as your bigger tables.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-meridian

We were seated on the patio as requested but soon found ourselves stomping ants. Lots and lots of ants. There's this stuff called bug killer. Use it! And it was kind of dirty out there. I know it's outside but some soap and water and some big killer would go a long way! Dirty outside, dirty inside. Our waitress was great. (I swore I was going to get her name but I always forget.) We ordered the A1 Peppercorn Burger and fries. Fries were excellent as always and the burger was ok. I don't think we'll be back in the near future.

Todd M.,"Eagle, ID",1,40,1,1.0,11/19/2017,"Why is this place so popular and busy?  Just for the family atmosphere?  Last time I'll ever go.  I used to like going for the steak fries which used to be hot, crispy, and fresh.  Now chewy and old tasting.  Fish, shrimp, and fries with no tarter sauce(like the photo) and no cocktail sauce which was needed due to the fish having ZERO flavor and the tiny shrimp were overcooked and dry with an awful batter.  Why would they put two large leafs of lettuce on top of the food unless they were trying to hide how bad it was.  Shouldn't you put the shrimp and smear of coleslaw on top of the lettuce leaves?  Also, why do they leave some of the tail and shell on the shrimp with no way of knowing that it's there while covered with the batter?  Must be that everyone loves chewing on shrimp tails and shell.  Could not have been worse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-meridian

We could wait 15-20 for a normal table, or sir in the lounge... glad we chose the lounge because we got Jess as our server. The BEST server yet at Red Robin.  Our order got messed up, she didn't even skip a beat and made sure it was corrected, promptly, and without any kind of attitude. Then we had some crazy changes we made to our food and drinks... she handled it all with complete understanding. We weren't trying to be difficult, but I'm sure we came across that way. She didn't flinch and gave us the best service we could ask for.  If she's not already someone that trains staff, she should be.

Lino R.,"Kuna, ID",190,189,864,3.0,4/18/2016,"There are just some restaurants that I struggle to write a review and this is one of them.  I think I am coming to understand that the restaurants I keep coming back to but have a hard time reviewing is because of inconsistency.  Red Robin is just that.  I have had some really good meals here and there have been times where I leave and say, I would be ok not coming back for a while.  Red Robin has gone through some changes recently when it comes to the decor and feel inside this place. Unlimited fries if you order a menu item with fries.  Their campfire sauce is really good and when the fries are hot, they taste great.  I've been here too many times were the fries are either great or stale and cold.  I know from others including myself that feel like the waiters and waitresses get annoyed when you ask for more fries.  I don't know what it is but I have felt that from many employees here over the years. Burgers are ok, sometimes it comes out hot, other times luke warm.  Keep in mind, that is my soap box, I like food hot and drinks cold so take my comments with a grain of salt. If I had a major complaint which isn't a bad thing for Red Robin is the place is usually packed and super loud.  Don't come here if you want to have a conversation with your table.  With their recent remodel, it seems to be more packed, less elbow room and a lot noisier.  Overall, just an average place for me and good place to come if unlimited fries sound good. P.S. Ask for garlic parmesian fries.  They are really good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-meridian
Tiffany S.,"Boise, ID",0,12,,5.0,7/29/2017,"My family has come here a couple times before and it was meh - meh food, meh service, meh drinks. My husband was craving a burger so we thought we'd try it out one more time. Soo glad we did!!!!  Morgan was extremely overwhelmed with the later rush of customers so her boyfriend, can't remember that man's name to save my life [if you read this I'm super sorry!!], helped her out. Immediately grabbed our drink orders and took less than 60 seconds to get them to us. After he dropped them off offered to grab our kids' order and our appetizer order. Kids came out pretty fast but our apps took a while - they were busy and he was honest it was taking a while because the cooks got busy really fast. Understandable, it happens! Apps came out - loved the pulled pork and chips. Pretzels were a bit over salty but it happens - I can brush salt off. Food came out for my husband and I and WOW!!! SO GOOD!! Fries were hot, burgers were delicious and perfectly cooked. Morgan stopped by a couple times to make sure we were okay - which we were. After we ate boyfriend came and socialized for a bit. Overall I would give 7 stars if we could. We'll always ask for them when we come back!!! THANKS YALL!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-meridian
Andrea D.,"Meridian, ID",25,48,12,4.0,1/21/2017,"Here we are two years after my last review and Red Robin has definitely improved. The staff has settled in, the kitchen seems to be more consistent, which means the food has improved. Honestly, the ""cup"" of soup is still a joke but the rest has worked itself out. The burger selection is on point and the other options are excellent. There are no pasta options anymore! Keep that in mind if you liked their pasta. They still have Kraft mac and cheese for the kids but that's all you expect in the pasta department. Overall, the menu is good with a wide variety of American food type options and the quality of service and taste has gone up.

Chryssa R.,"Boise, ID",39,112,18,2.0,7/6/2016,"We came here on my son's 4th birthday and even though I told 2 hostesses, and reminded our waiter 3 - 4 times, no one came out to sing to him. After we ate, our server was MIA so I  told another server and still nothing happened. A while later, our server came out and sang to a table near us (someone else's birthday), but it still didn't jog his memory that there was a little boy waiting for his moment at our table. Then we received our bill. So I went to find a manager who eventually brought out half-melted ice cream and the staff FINALLY sang to my son. We never got an apology or explanation from our server. The whole ordeal took way too long and I was shocked at the poor customer service. We definitely won't spend another birthday meal here. I also dislike the iPad-type device at each table, begging kids to tap the screen. Our server wouldn't remove it, so it became an un-fun parenting moment for me. Kids these days need LESS screen time - not more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-meridian
Bryce R.,"Sherwood, OR",3,16,8,2.0,9/6/2017,"As a seasoned Yelp critic I pride myself on dining at only the finest of establishments and holding them to highest standards humanly possible. Now that, that, is out of the way lets begin the review... It is Friday evening in ""downtown"" Boise and the night life is a bumpin. As I approach the parking lot I notice there are only two cars parked. ""Are they remodeling the Robin?"" I thought to myself, as it is very odd for such a fine establishment to be packed to the entrance. Normally I would have made reservations, however this was a last minute decision. As I enter, there is a young man blowing up balloons. Normally I would say ""yeah blow all the balloons you can"" however he was filling an empty room with balloons. When there are more balloons than patrons... you have a problem. I stand there waiting for him to get up when a young lady appears and ask if we have been helped. I replied ""No, I've been watching this kid blow more balloons than a clown on tour"" so it was at this moment I was finally seated. Instead of a human helping me I had this robot etch a sketch thing take my order. I own a Razr flip phone so I am out of touch with all these fancy gadgets. I finally figure out the hieroglyphics key code in order to request an order. My burger was good. They skimped super tough on the fries which confused me since the entire place was basically empty. When I order unlimited fries I never want to see the bottom of the basket. I stared deeply into the checkered lining paper for 10 minutes before a refill was brought to me. I had to practically beg for more honey mustard. That stuff is the dank.  Will I return? Probs not as I have had better service at Oil Can Henrys.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-meridian
Victor T.,"Boise, ID",20,23,7,1.0,7/13/2017,"Do NOT Order to go from this location! Burger Fries and a milkshake ordered online. Website says 13 minutes till pickup is ready. I showed up 10 minutes after I ordered expecting another 5 to 10 minutes wait in case they were busy. They were not busy when I showed up. Went up to the counter to collect my order and it wasn't ready yet which was fine so I sat down to wait. They brought me the milkshake I ordered almost immediately. A milkshake is not an appetizer, it should be made 30 seconds before the food shows up in a to go. I have been sitting here for half an hour in my food still is not here. So now it has been 40 minutes since I ordered online. People who sat down after me have ordered and received their food already. My milkshake is now completely melted and nothing but flavored milk.

Mike M.,"Meridian, ID",2,40,,2.0,5/6/2016,"This is a chain restaurant and it's pretty obvious. The food lacks character and there are all sorts of weird promotions and gimmicks. The tables have a tablet thing that you can use to pay, order drinks, flag your server, etc. If I wanted to order from a machine, I'd get my meals from a vending machine. It's not that this location in particular is unsatisfactory, rather, that appears to be the trend I've seen the last couple times I was at Red Robin.  As I said previously, the food lacks character. I got what was billed as a spicy burger. It was not. It was a thin meat patty with some incredibly salty 'fried jalapeño medallions', their 'ghost pepper sauce' (which is glorified ketchup), and some lettuce, tomato, etc. The fries were okay, but you should really order them well-done or else they'll come out wobbly and mealy.  My girlfriend got some chicken tenders which tasted as though they'd been fried in really old oil. They had a weird bitterness to them that was pretty well masked with the dipping sauce. The best part of the meal was the onion rings. Those were pretty darn good.  The service was okay, but our server seemed more interested in getting us to use the tablet thing than actually taking our orders. To be honest, I got the feeling that this is a chain restaurant desperately trying to stay afloat but really just grasping at straws.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-meridian?start=20
John H.,"Southeast Boise, Boise, ID",11,1,,1.0,5/7/2017,"Do not buy into Red Robin's stupid loyalty program. You are supposed to receive a free burger in the month of your birthday. I had signed up for this loyalty program and ordered a burger thinking it would be free, but I guess since I had not updated my profile settings, the staff said I would have to wait 24 hours until I could redeem it and charged me. The manager and server were unhelpful. I was at Red Robin then and had no plans on coming back later in the month.

Great for groups, great for kids as it's loud in general in there and cleanup of spills/mess is easy due to their stained concrete floors and smooth table tops.

Phillip D.,"Meridian, ID",40,83,,4.0,9/24/2014,"Right off the bat I will say that I am a fan. In case you didnt gather this from the star rating I gave them. Guess what I have when I go to red Robin? yeah, you guessed it, a burger. Well, I did have the Fish and Chips a couple times. So I will review some of the various things that I have had here. I did like the fish and chips here with an exception. The exception is grease. They seem to be very hit and miss with this. Sometimes you can get their fish and chips and the grease is minimal. Sometimes you will get their fish and chips and can barely see the fish for the grease. Ok, so maybe that is a bit of an over exaggeration, but sometimes you have to do these things to make a point. The point being that there was just way too much grease. What I hate the most if when I complain to the server. Often what I get is; ""Its fried. Grease is what happens when you fry things."" I even heard this from a manger once. A bit off the subject, but I hate these sorts of comments. I was in a BBQ joint once and the Brisket was very fatty. I asked the server if there was any leaner and she replied; ""That is the way brisket is. Its always fatty."" I almost came out of my seat! Needless to say, I have no been back there since.  Back on track. I dont get thier Fish and Chips anymore. Its just too risky for me. I have had most of their burgers. These are often hit and miss as well, but this is pretty common when you are hiring cooks and not paying them much. My norm is the chili cheeseburger. In fact, the last couple times I was here, I had the Banzi Burger and had them turn this into a chili burger. Even better is if you replace the mayo with mustard. I know it sounds weird, but there is just something about the acid in the mustard which really plays well to Chili. I love their chili here. It peppery and very flavorful. The only thing I wish they had was a version of the chili without beans. My main advice here it to not look down. On more than 1 occasion, I dropped a crayon (My daughter is 10 and we often play Football with crayons on the table) under the table. When I looked under the table to get it, I was disgusted There was food and trash all under the table. So when you go Red Robin, enjoy the food, but dont look down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-meridian?start=20
Kyle C.,"Kent, WA",22,97,116,3.0,11/21/2014,"My love affair with RR stared long, long ago. Since then, I've had many ups and down with this place in different locations. I'll always keep coming back. Unfortunately, this was not the best of times.  My group and I showed up right at opening for an early lunch and were the first people in. We sat and ordered quick enough and our server Jannel was very sweet. Really, the only problem was that we only got one order of fries. We chose to RR for a mass French fry intake, and in that regard we were let down. Big guys at the table who all ordered entrees were made to split single baskets of fries. Out second basket came after our check had been paid. Not what we had in mind when we we thought of a satisfying meal.   The burgers were delicious as always, the environment was great and the staff was friendly.

I guess they were low on staff.  However, when we got seated, manager came to apologize for the wait, and our server was 100% perfect in all categories!  Lilya was Ukrainian, with a slight accent, and an ideal demeanor for the job she has. Smiled the whole time, and well deserved of the tip we left.  We now have someone we will ask for from now on.  Couldn't have asked for a more pleasant experience.  Thanks!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-meridian?start=20

Josh M.,"Boise, ID",60,48,27,4.0,2/4/2015,"Still one of my favorite burger chains. Service is usually good. Food is pretty predictable with a decent selection and variety.  You can get beef burgers,  veg I burgers, chicken sandwich or salads.  The drinks,  non-alcoholic ones, are bottomless as are the fries.  You can get ranch or fry sauce to help all the fries go down easier. They have a full bar and a decent selection of beer on tap. Red Robin had always been a favorite place for me and my son loves it too. They have a good selection of non-alcoholic specialty drinks which probably helps my son like it, hey how can you not love strawberry lemonade?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-meridian?start=40

Kerilyn R.,"Meridian, ID",0,3,,1.0,6/13/2015,This location has horrible service. It seems like they are ALWAYS short staffed or something? We asked for fries to start with while we waited for our food and they never came. After waiting 30 minutes our burgers finally arrive and we requested our extra fries we already ordered and our campfire sauce. When the fries came our waitress brought us 1 sauce. 1. It took another 15 minutes to flag her down to get more! She seemed put off by us and was a little rude. This isn't a new experience for us at this location. I just thought maybe we hit them on a busy night? But to always seem short staffed and always have bad service?

Frank M.,"Meridian, ID",0,23,4,1.0,2/25/2016,"Very disappointing dinner tonight for many reasons. Ordered soup, came out luke warm. Burger was fair. Fries were cold. Asked for new batch of fries, told it would take 4 mins for fries to be ready -10 mins later we told them to cancel the request. Server was busy but forgot to provide good service - drinks went dry. Worst part was seeing the cooks cleaning the equipment with food sitting on the line. The cleaning spray was falling on the food. The cook was standing on something and every time he bent over we saw a typical plumbers butt crack. My wife spoke to the manager to explain everything about the cleaning solution and the butt crack - all she did was laugh about it. Very unprofessional. Will not return.

Julie E.,"Boise, ID",195,326,264,3.0,7/26/2014,"My husband and me have been staying away from Red Robin a bit since our last experience (at the Parkcenter location in Boise) was less than stellar.  We feel that changes Red Robin has made to 'keep up' with the more upscale burger joints (Five Guys/Smash Burger etc) took away from some of what made them our favorite sit down burger place.  My husband had a free birthday burger available to him though, so we took a chance at the Eagle Road location.   Since we were only the second customers through the door of the day, being greeted and seated was no problem.  We were seated in a booth just behind the passway aisle between the bar and the main restaurant.  In retrospect this was kind of annoying.. HOWEVER we failed to speak up when the hostess asked if the spot was okay, so the onus was on US.  Gone are the table tents that used to tout the current 'special' burger (right now some ginormous thing with brisket on it to go with the new ""Hercules"" movie) Gone are the large glossy tri-fold plastic menus (replaced by smaller, spiral bound booklets).  Also gone are the funky little cardboard coasters for your beverage.  STILL there however, an assortment of intriguing appetizers, beverages, burgers, sandwiches, salads, entrees and desserts.  As others have mentioned, the prices have indeed gone up.  You have to be very careful when looking at the burgers if you are having to watch your pennies.. I wound up with an 'artisan' burger (the black and bleu,.. noms) that was $14 compared to others as low as $7.99.  As we reviewed the menu I saw the hostess coming our way with a family of four.  Parents and two little ones probably no older than 2 and 4.  Despite the entire restaurant being open season, they were seated directly behind us.   I promise, I understand that servers have their set 'areas' and that keeping patrons in the areas with assigned servers is status quo, but I still fail to see why at least ONE booth couldn't have been left as a buffer.   To their credit however, the parents did a wonderful job of keeping the noise level down, there were no kicks to the back of our booth and no little hands sought to try advanced knot tying with my hair (which HAS happened to me in other places).   Hubby chose the crispy chicken sandwich, asking it be placed in a basket (they've done away with the red plastic baskets in favor of what we think are some horrific plates) that his sandwich be wrapped (they don't do that anymore either unless you ask) and cut in half.  He also asked for ranch to dip his fries in.  I ordered the  Black and Bleu burger and fries. (On Ciabatta bread served open face, the burger is topped with sauteed mushrooms, grilled onions and crumbled bleu cheese, a 'knife and forker' delight!).   He was drinking the tropical green tea (a bit to sweet for my taste) I went with  diet Dr. Pepper.   Our order arrived, prepared exactly as we asked it to be.  The food was hot and tasty.  Our server was a bit slow on drink refills (again odd, as there were very few people in the restaurant).  When the manager came around to see how we were doing his arms were laden with notebooks and a box of Krispy Kreme donuts, which I thought was not only unprofessional but left us feeling like we'd interrupted his day).   We lingered a bit over beverage refills and a 2nd order of fries then left.  Oh and apparently they've done away with the free birthday dessert.  But at almost 50 my husband and me are okay with that.  Suffice it to say this was a much better Red Robin experience than our last forray in Boise.  We'll likely go back to this location again, for MY birthday in October.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-meridian?start=40

He refilled our drinks BEFORE we hit the bottom, he put in our food right away and it came quickly. Can I just say how hard it is to find good customer service in Boise, and at Red Robin of all places?! You go in to a chain and you automatically make your assumptions, but this place rocked!

Bill M.,"Meridian, ID",2,56,,2.0,5/17/2015,"My family eats at Red Robin at least once or twice a month.  So I feel confident in saying that we have seen this particular location slide a bit in the quality of service, quality of food and accuracy of our orders.  It continues to be on a downward trend.  The last couple times have been particularly challenging.  If you stay with me, I'll tell you about two specifics examples.  The first one has to do when we order shakes.  When we dine at Red Robin, we always order shakes.  My wife and I each get a monster shake and then ask to split them so we can share with our kids.  In the past, they would bring us the shakes in two adult and two smaller/kid sized glasses, looking pretty, with straws, spoons and extra napkins.  The past few times we have ordered shakes, we usually get a glass and the extra in the metal tin; and are missing either spoons, straws, or both and always have to ask for extra napkins.  Maybe I'm spoiled or my expectations are unrealistic, I think shakes should always come with a straw and a spoon; when children are involved, you should always bring extra napkins; and when sharing is involved, you always present the shared shakes as you would present the normal shakes, and reserve just dropping the metal tin of extra shake for the individual orders.  My second example, and the last time we ate at Red Robin was a to-go order, which we like to do from time to time, since the restaurant can be so crowded and busy.  I called the restaurant's phone number to order and they now have an automated answering system.  I selected the appropriate choice to place a to-go order.  The phone then rang and rang and rang and rang, for approximately 2-3 minutes; so long that it rang back, or I was sent back, to the original automated message.  So, I again selected the option to place a to-go order.  After a few rings, someone appeared to answer and put me directly on hold, as I began to hear nothing other than music and no one ever introduced themselves to me or asked me to be placed on hold.  I find this incredibly rude and one of the worst things to do to a customer calling in.  I played along, and sat on hold for more than 10 minutes; I looked at the timer on my phone before hanging up.  I decided to call back.  This time I selected the choice in the automated system to speak to a person.  (Sorry if I butcher the spelling of names from here on in my story)  Elaina answered the phone.  I tried to tell her my story.  When she heard me say 'to-go' she immediately cut me off, talked over me, didn't let me finish, and said she would be transferring me to the bar.  Being talked over and transferred off before finishing my statement is another of my major pet peeves, as a customer.  It shows a basic lack of respect and tells me I'm not important, just a disruption to your day.  When I was transferred to the bar, I was put back on hold.  I held for another 3 minutes.  As I was contemplating hanging up and driving to the restaurant to place my order, and share my grievances to someone in person, Melissa answered.  I finally got to give my order.  In all fairness, I did call at around 18:10; so I'm sure they were busy.  I don't think busy excuses basic common courtesy.  When my wife returned home from picking up our order, it was wrong.  The quality of food was okay, not what I would expect, with barely cooked fries and a burger that wasn't cooked well done; though wasn't pink, which is the choice you get, pink or no pink.  Unfortunately, having our orders wrong has become a habit; we now expect it.  Luckily, it wasn't anything we couldn't just pick off or do without.  When this particular location first opened, it was shaky.  Then they seemed to improve and we loved dining there.  Now it is becoming a place we don't enjoy going.  We have been having issues with Red Robin locations is other places, cities, states.  We have been told it is because of corporate changes.  I can't tell you what can be attributed to changes; and what is just a basic lack of customer service and pride in your work.  All I know is that with each dining experience, we are thinking more and more that Red Robin is not a place we want to frequent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-meridian?start=40

TheStranger 2.,"Meridian, ID",1,76,8,1.0,9/27/2014,"This location in Meridian, is the perfect example of how one franchise can be so bad and one so good.  This location is BAD.   We arrived for late lunch on a Saturday and seated promptly. They were busy, but not to capacity.  It was about six minutes until our server arrived.  She was pleasant and took our drink order then disappeared.  We sat and sat.  She brought no water nor utensils.  We sat and sat.  She brought our drinks, took our order then disappeared again.  Still no water or utensils.  I finally flagged her down and asked for water and utensils which she brought finally.  The Food: Terrible.  I ordered the Big Red Tavern burger.  For $8.79 one would think it would be something better than ordinary.  It wasn't.  Comparable  to a ""fast food"" burger for  $3.99. My GF ordered the catfish with steamed veggies.  Her portions were tiny and they gave her french-fries instead of veggies.  We brought this to the attention of our occasional server.  She was clueless about the meal, but brought the veggies, which were barely warm.  My burger was so small that I kept requesting the ""bottomless steak fries"" and took bites only intermittently.  The Food: Inconstant and mediocre.    The Service: Slow and slower.  The exact opposite of our experience at the Milwaukee location.  We won't ever return to the Meridian Red Robin for any reason.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-meridian?start=40

It does matter, because I've never had a chain restaurant meal that was very good. They don't have any leeway to offer anything other than what corporate approves. Everything is shipped in frozen so that every restaurant tastes the same, which equates to bland average food that you can get anywhere. If that's what you like, then by all means go there. Not my idea of a good meal. It always cracks me up when people travel to another city, and then they eat at a chain restaurant to get the same bland crap that they can get in their own home town.
