Jess B.,"Indianapolis, IN",1,48,,5.0,9/10/2017,"My husband and I took his sister here for her birthday dinner on Saturday night. The restaurant wasn't packed but wasn't dead either. Our server was super friendly and on point! We ordered drinks, an appetizer and food and everything was perfect and came out quickly. My husbands sister got a free birthday sundae but passed on the embarrassing singing and clapping. We had a great time and will definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville
Theresa K.,"Crown Point, IN",9,33,10,5.0,8/10/2017,"Great date night hang out. Cool decor and clean facility. You can hang out in the bar or even sit outside. Let him take you shopping at the mall, Pokémon hunting across the street then go grab a bite before your movie. Theatre is across the parking lot. Great location! Endless fries are get this endless! Salt lovers will need to add salt though. Pretzel bite appetizer was delicious. Refills on drinks just magically appeared. That could be because our waitress Sabrina does an amazing job. She was so cheerful and friendly! The burgers are so yummy. I had the bacon cheeseburger and got to pick out which cheese I wanted. Plus Sabrina did not even blink when I asked for no mayo no tomato and ordered it on an onion roll. Food came out of the kitchen quick and was fresh and so goood! Hubby ordered a burger with so many things on it and it was done right too. Generous portions, delicious food, friendly staff and the manager even did a real table visit not just a pass by! I have not eaten here in awhile and now with this visit going so well I definitely will be back! We only waited a minute or two to be seated and the place had a nice size crowd inside. They really did everything right!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville
Jeremy M.,"Near West Side, Chicago, IL",37,3,1,1.0,8/31/2017,The service here is horrible anytime after 4pm. Really a joke. Ten minute waits to sit and the place is 40% occupied.

Rosa J.,"Chicago, IL",373,1007,3544,4.0,4/27/2015,"Choices of restaurants outside of Chicago are mostly commercial.  Red Robin is one of the chains that we still, somehow, patronize till these days.   We came in during the weekday afternoon, way passing the lunch-time rush.  Hence, the entire restaurant was peaceful and service was attentive.   Steve, a.k.a. ""Batman,"" was our server.  He literally had his name badge temporarily changed so that he could accomplish this alter-ego.  He was humorous and easy-going.  Hey, I appreciated his creativity, especially working at off-peak times.   We were pretty familiar with the menu at Red Robin, since we've gone to various locations in Chicagoland, Northwest Indiana, and other parts of the United States.  I picked one of my go-to's, the Bleu Ribbon (with blue cheese and fried onion strings); hubby went with the cod sandwich.   We had ""buzz"" caused by the strong morning coffee from Dark Matter (see review on DM if you want to know the alternative solution of getting ""high""). Well...hush...I didn't say that word...at least didn't mean that way... Let's go back to the center of our current discussion, Red Robin (yummmm).  We also shared the artichoke & spinach dip appetizer.  To be quite honest, the level of salinity wasn't optimal.  However, with the amount of caffeine we had in our systems, that extra sodium was merely an elixir.   Burgers at Red Robin were never subpar, yet I couldn't say they were extraordinary.  Their loyalty program is what makes me keep on coming back.  Every nine (9) entrees you've order, the tenth (10th.) one will be free!  You also get a free burger or an entree of your choice on your birthday month.  There are also promotions and coupons as long as you're subscribed to their e-mailing list.   Thank you, Batman...just let you know the new Joker at the new Batman movie looks fierce.  Hopefully he stays ""sane"" this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville
Eric G.,"Gary, IN",45,257,313,4.0,12/22/2015,"Merrillville is one of the go-to burbs for a lot of the chain stores and restaurants that aren't in the city.   D and I aren't fans of the horrific traffic on its main thoroughfare but we (well D...LOL) needed to do some last minute holiday shopping so brave it we did.    We decided to take a lunch break at RR. We were told the restaurant was busy and asked if we could sit at the bar.   D and I were fine with that...in fact last time we went here we sat at the exact same area in the bar.   Our bartender/server came over to us right away and was working on his ""up-sell"" to buy a drink instead of just water.    He was very humorous about it and gave us both a chuckle.   I did end up ordering their sangria drink which was fine. When going in the back to hit the restroom I noticed the main dining area wasn't as filled up as I thought it was.   I wonder if some of that may play into the long wait times that some reviews have been reporting.    Who knows? But D and I both enjoyed the burgers.   I especially liked their black and bleu burger on their ""finest"" portion of the menu.  The fries servings are light but then again since they are ""bottomless fries"" as long as you're able to flag the server for more fries, it's a moot point. Overall it's a good place to get your burger on that's a slight step above McDonald's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville
Purvi P.,"Fort Wayne, IN",0,12,,4.0,8/13/2017,"I am not a burger gal, so this place wasn't for me to begin with. I was expecting more from there menu for non burger people like myself and was disappointed by there menu selection. They do offer salads and wraps and a few other items, but honestly was not impressed by any of there offerings. HOWEVER, i am giving them 4 stars because I do believe they have a great selection for those burger lovers out there, considering thats what they are known for! Awesome deals for those looking for great burgers! cant beat bottomless sides & a burger!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville
Ed R.,"Merrillville, IN",13,75,131,2.0,9/13/2015,"Went here with the kids tonight because the weather was nice and thought we could sit outside. Things started off well enough I suppose.  Food: dude, it's Red Robin. Don't ask about the food. All the burgers pretty much taste the same. The ""bottomless steak fries"" are pretty bland unless you salt them to kingdom come. Beyond that everything on the menu is deep fried. That's all you need to know.  Service: pretty sure our server was either on her first day, or her last day, cause she did NOT care! My wife ordered Raspberry Iced Tea, but got Raspberry Lemonade. She also ordered an Avacabo salad because she wanted hard-boiled egg... She TOLD the server,  ""I'm getting this because I want hard-boiled egg..""  The salad came and after a minute she noticed that it had no egg on it! The server came back and we asked her about the egg.. The server literally did the following: ""Ohhhh.. Yeah, we are out of egg. Our supplier did not bring any.""  *took 5 steps away and started to open he door to go back inside, then turned around* ""Do you want anything else instead?""  Umm, no, we're good, thanks.  Beyond that we didn't see much of her.  Food was ""meh"" at best. Probably won't be coming back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville

First off, the best server ever, Jared is still working here and even though he wasn't serving our table,  he still took a minute to stop by and speak.  I highly recommend you ask for him if you can. We had Kayla as a server and she was quick and a sweetheart. My experience this time outweighed the bad experiences from before.

Jemmie W.,"Carmel, IN",200,558,2691,2.0,7/27/2015,"I was traveling on business with some business associates. They wanted to stop here for lunch. Sure. The bottom line is that I have yet to notice the difference between ""gourmet"" burgers and non-gourmet burgers. From what I can tell, they are all low quality beef chuck on some kind of bun. The difference is mostly the price and presentation. Save some money and time and go to a non gourmet burger place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville
Mary Kay B.,"Chicago, IL",42,154,53,5.0,12/27/2015,"My husband and I stopped here on a Sunday in late December. We used to love this chain but the locations near us started going downhill on food quality.  We decided to give them another try at this location.  Pleasantly surprised!  We sat in the bar area and received fresh hot food,  quick friendly service and prompt refills on drinks.  We will be back.   Try not to judge a chain restaurant bad on one location.  Give this place a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville
Maru M.,"Hobart, IN",0,24,4,1.0,5/31/2016,"Horrible, horrible, horrible!!! Our server took our order & then disappeared. I finally flagged her down after 30 minutes (no seriously, 30 minutes!) & asked where our food was. She comes back & says that our 'ticket was lost' & that she had to retake our order. She promised that the order would come quickly, that the kitchen staff was doing ours next in front of all the other orders. Another 20 minutes went by.  I know at this point you've gotta be thinking, ""why wouldn't they just leave?""  The answer, my friends, is simple: we had already invested more than an hour waiting & it has gotten so late, that most other places had closed or were closing. We were determined to wait it out.  We did finally get our food but my husbands burger was not right; nor did we get utensils or napkins. Our sever, once again, had disappeared.  We will NEVER be back.

Christopher K.,"Hobart, IN",2,10,2,4.0,12/10/2015,"Visited as a result of their recent promotion to try their new chicken sandwich (free for people named Christopher for a special holiday promotion). It's a great tasting chicken sandwich topped with bacon, greens, cheese, a special sauce, and a special bun. The fries are bottomless as usual at Red Robin. The staff was friendly and the restaurant atmosphere was pleasant. In previous visits, the prices have tended to be a little bit on the higher side for an overall experience that isn't necessarily exceptional, but it is generally a good quality experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville

Jason A.,"Chicago, IL",38,148,16,1.0,5/25/2015,"This may have been the worst restaurant at which I have ever eaten.  We arrived about the time they opened, waited about two minutes to be seated, and then waited another 10 minutes to place our order.   It took about 25 minutes for them to cook our burgers.  We paid extra for the ""big"" burgers, only to find out that their definition of big is 6 ounces.  Charging over $10 for 6 oz of beef is ridiculous.  We had ""bottomless"" sides, but couldn't get the server's attention, and he certainly didn't take the initiative to bring more sides.  After 45 minutes I had to get up, run in front of him, and ask for the bill.  He apologized and said they got ""real busy"" all of the sudden.  The restaurant wasn't even half full.   We asked for the manager, who offered us a ""sorry,"" but didn't take anything off of the bill.  She also gave us the excuse that they were too busy to take care of their customers.  She has no business being a manager if she and 3 servers can't handle 15 tables at the same time.

Frank J.,"Newark, CA",37,122,761,3.0,4/29/2015,"Went here today for lunch to give Red Robin a chance to make up for the horrible service that we receive previously! I can only say...that our server (Charity) continued with the non-charitable mentality from our previous visit! First, when she informed us of her name, I expressed, ""Then this means that she would be giving us much charity?"" She replied, ""It means that she should receive charity!"" I had the nerve to think she was just jesting but...her action deemed otherwise! She asked, could she start us off w/drinks. We stated yes, (2) iced waters w/lemons and could she please change the channel of the screen right in front of us! She said, ""Sure, be right back!"" She left to take care of other patrons, then returned to see if we wanted any appetizers but she didn't bring us the drinks. She brought the waters but NO lemons and didn't change the channel as well! The manager (Gabriel), brought us our appetizer along w/a big smile and courteous voice. Then, I had to ask if he could bring us some lemons as we requested from our server. He expressed he would have someone bring them right away and he would have someone change the channel as well! Funny thing was...just before the manager made this statement, we saw our server pass by with a plate of lemons and tea to another patron whom came into the restaurant after we came...Wow! As (Charity) continued to show NO charity to us, a young server (Jared) w/a GREAT smile came bringing us our lemons! We recognized (Jared) from another restaurant we use to frequent before its closing! He began to give us the great service as he use to give at the other restaurant...and asked us if he could get us anything else! We said, ""Thanks but we are OK, but he also showed our server and the hostess how to change the channel of the screen we were watching! Then after a few minutes the manager, Gabriel, Not our server brought us our entrees. To be truthful...we hadn't seen (Charity) for sometime, now! If you've been to Red Robin before, you no you normally receive unlimited fries with your sandwich order. So, as we waited for over 12 mins for our server to come by to check on us and maybe receive a refill of fries, there was another waitress (Ashley) who was working so hard and fast with the serving of her patrons that as she would pass us by...we could actually feel a slight cool breeze! I am not exaggerating AT ALL! I had to ask her name and. compliment her on her service to others! We expressed to her that her new nickname was ""Cool Breeze""! Afterwards, we all laughed and before she left she ask me if she could refill my water and even give us a refill of fries! She was literally back with water and fries with in 2 mins...now that's GREAT service! Then low and behold, here comes our server (Charity) with a basket of fries as well...and we just saw her pass us by with the new basket of fries Ashley just gave us! Sorry Charity...too late! So now as its time for us to leave guess who wants to show us some charity or at least some attention? Before we left we made sure to give Jared and Ashley a tip for their beyond the call of duty service! Thanks for making up for bad service Jared, Ashley, and Gabriel! That is why I'm giving you guys 3 stars instead of 1 because you have 3 stars at the restaurant with Jared, Ashley, and Gabriel! Take note Ms. Charity!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville
Mary P.,"Crete, IL",5,14,34,2.0,8/9/2014,Was celebrating my son-in-laws birthday and was disappointed. We were seated promptly but the waitress was very slow.

When I asked the waitress for more sauces she said she would have to charge us. I explained that what they brought out wasn't even full then showed her the menu picture.

Kristen J.,"Chesterton, IN",0,35,,2.0,11/14/2014,"OK, I am a long time fan of Red Robin.  I've eaten there at least once a month for as long as I can remember.  That is, until now. My husband and I met some friends at this particular Red Robin last weekend.  We were unpleasently surprised to find that the whole restaurant had been remodeled and not in a good way.  All of the booths were taken out except for just a few and replaced with tables.  SHORT tables!!  At 5'6"" I am by no means tall.  But I felt like a giant sitting at the new table.  It was so low I felt like I was eating out of my lap!  Not very comfortable at all!!The restaurant was EXTREMELY crowded and now that all the booths are gone it was noisier than usual.  Our waitress was extremely overwhelmed.  My husband ordered a beer about 10 min. after we sat down (when the waitress finally took our order).  Unfortunately, he did not receive his beer for another half hour.  And that was after it sat out on the bar and got warm.  There wasn't even any frost on the glass anymore!!  Then our food came.  All four of us ordered burgers which were all fine.  Everything was cooked properly and still warm but the fries that accompanied our burgers were ICE cold.  Service was extremely slow compared to what it used to be and all of the servers seemed to be confused.  We watched numerous people around us, all whom had been seated AFTER us, be served before us.  Not sure what is going on with Red Robin, but I really didn't feel comfortable there with the new rennovations and I certainly didn't appreciate the slower service.   Probably won't be going back to this one for a while until they can get their act together!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville?start=40

My first two visits in Skokie and Bolingbrook were good but nothing that really wowed me in the least. I have to say that this third visit is the one that really impressed me the most.  The food was excellent and I am assuming that the quality is what should be expected at a Red Robin, this place has raised the bar completely for my next visit. Everything was very good. The garlic Parmesan fries were excellent and not too greasy. My burger was cooked perfectly and was put together nice and neat and it was easy to eat.  Our server was great. He kept on refilling out chips, salsa nd guacamole (which was just an OK appetizer) and kept on checking on us but not the point of being annoying..

Paila M.,"Merrillville, IN",0,1,,1.0,2/9/2015,This had to be the worst dining experience I have ever experienced in my entire life! We arrived around 6 PM there was no hostess so we waited and waited and waited and finally she came out looked at me and said just a minute walked away then we waited and waited and waited some more we should have known better this was a red flag should have walked out the door. She finally took our name I requested a booth for for to celebrate my husbands birthday she said I'll let you know when it's ready another party of four came in following us and we're seated before us in a booth right next to the one we were finally seated in. It only gets better from here...we waited and waited some more and finally we received a waitress Amanda she was very friendly she took our order and that's the last time we saw her until we had some issues with our order. A very large party came in and took over the staff at the restaurant. Our waitress included. our food finally arrived cold and incomplete mind you my husband also also ordered a root beer float that he did not get until our meal came he went to the bar and asked for it himself. The sandwich I ordered was not correct we were missing the oranges from the kids meals. We flag down another server to try to correct the problems and possibly get refills on drinks and some straws because we never received them or silverware. No real beer float again so my husband went to the bar and got it himself that's when someone from the bar area came out and gave me an extremely dirty look and I gave it right back to her. My family was done with their meal before my sandwich came I at this point had lost my appetite and the sandwich was incorrect again so I just asked for carry out containers as it was getting late and this party was taking over the entire restaurant. The manager came out and said I will comp the root beer float and the kids meal big deal. And what topped it off we went to use the restroom it was absolutely disgusting and there was no toilet paper!!! The manager kept coming to the table making excuses saying they just fired and hired recently saying that was the reason for the issues. our first waitress came to the table and said I'm sorry about everything but the manager told her to help the party table. No mention of my husband's birthday as they have done in the past when we have gone there for parties.

A group of us (6 total) decided to come here.  We were told that we have to wait 10 minutes...not bad...but we ended up waiting for 30 minutes, but did I mention that it was slow and we were actually looking at our table...which was clear and clean?  So I am not sure why we had to wait so long. Then, it took our waitress 10 minutes to come and greet us, saying that she will be right back to take our drink orders.  Then came back 5 minutes later.  We placed our drink and food order, since we had 15 minutes to look at the menu. My husband ordered a shake, which was not the correct one when they brought it out.  He also did not receive the correct food order. We asked for separate checks at the beginning of the meal, but the waitress ended up putting 2 of the other orders on our check...which made it a bit awkward. So, we had to ask for a correct check.   She only came to check on us once throughout our dinner.  The check took a while to come back as well.

Shanae T.,"Chicago, IL",25,12,2,2.0,10/4/2015,We decided to stop for lunch and decided on Red Robin. We have visited several different locations and they were all great. This one on the other hand. Service was meh and the food was cold. I will never return to this location!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville?start=20
Andrew R.,"Michigan City, IN",0,6,2,1.0,10/17/2015,"This particular Red Robin has a staff that is slow.  The sad part is Red Robin has interactive screens that will take your order which you would think would speed things up. Unfortunately, this establishment was well below par and no  sense of urgency for their customers. Our waitress gave us drinks with no straws and when we used the tablet to have the waitress come to our table it take over 30/minutes. When our onion ring order arrived is was cold. Our waitress Courtney showed no interest in our table or other tables she was responsible for. Overall, you family was highly disappointed and will not be coming back. To add insult to injury we asked for two to go boxes and we were only given one which seemed like the smallest to go box Courtney could find.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville?start=20
Myranda Z.,"Crete, IL",240,26,1,5.0,3/8/2015,Had a rough start but the food was great and Lisa the manager is awesome. Tortilla soup was really great. Every one was happy by the time we left.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville?start=20
Buck O.,"Crown Point, IN",76,32,12,1.0,12/12/2014,It reminds me of an overpriced diner with a great drink selection of drinks. Unfortunately for me it was just a great selection because the waitress/bartender failed miserably at getting me a second beer! I regretfully have to say I will be coming back because for some reason my kids love this place,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville?start=20
Randy G.,"Hobart, IN",0,5,,1.0,5/4/2016,Love the food. Hated the wait over an hour wait for our food. Only half the tables were full and I counted 4 tables that seated after ours and received there food first. I received wrong burger and waitress argued with me about it. Will not be coming back in the near future. I think they need some time to get there act together.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville?start=20
Ben K.,"Hobart, IN",0,5,,2.0,6/14/2015,Ok this place was a nightmare/train wreck all in one. First we ordered our sons mean when we ordered our app. Well we got our app then we ordered our food our food came and then my sons meal was nowhere to be found. Then they finally found it only to be the wrong order all together. My burglar was dry and my fries were cold trust me when I say I will not be coming back here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville?start=20
Rick B.,"Orland Park, IL",41,692,383,2.0,6/28/2013,"OK burger joint, as far as fast food goes. They did one of our burgers wrong, but immediately fixed it - so they tried their best. Had the unlimited fries, but that only works if the service is around to refill them often. But all-in-all, this is a typical Red Robin. Nice large store layout.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville?start=20
Rodney L.,"Valparaiso, IN",14,26,1,2.0,12/31/2014,Food was good but won't come back as service was horrible. Our waiter could care less about being their and it showed.   Would not recommend.  BW is next door.  Would have been the better choice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville?start=20
scott f.,"Chicago Heights, IL",58,9,15,1.0,6/13/2015,3 times had to send food back incorrectly prepared. Waitresses are amateurs. Overpriced and nothing special here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville?start=20

Annie L.,"Chicago, IL",39,46,22,3.0,3/9/2013,"You can get a gluten free bun. Period.  Service is OK. Food is OK. It's all pretty standard. If you want a gourmet burger, you should go to a gourmet restaurant. No, seriously. Cooper's Hawk has the Zinfandel burger. It will blow your mind...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville?start=20
Yolanda T.,"Chicago, IL",5,20,13,1.0,10/4/2015,"This is my very last visit to Red Robin in Merrillville. My family waited, along with 5 other parties, for more than 15 minutes to be seated.  There were several tables available, but we all assumed they were slow seating us because they were short handed with servers. While waiting, a party of 6 enters the restaurant  and was seated immediately by a server named Erica.  Mind you, Red Robin does not make reservations. It was obvious that because they were her family they were privileged enough to not have to wait. I expressed my frustration to the hostess and requested to see a manager regarding the blantant disregard for all waiting parties.  Well, this is the first time a manager has never addressed a customer after being requested.  Seems like the entire staff, including the manager needs training on customer service. I only spend my money where it's appreciated. Never again Red Robin in Merrillville.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville?start=20
R Jimmie L.,"Chicago, IL",82,7,,1.0,8/9/2015,"This place is a joke. We waited 10 minutes to be seated at 7pm on a Sunday. There were at least 20 open tables, most of them hadn't been bussed.  When a hostess finally showed up, she was cold and unfriendly. She sat us at a table that was not wiped, had food all over the booth bench, and food all over the floor. We could have played soccer with the chicken fingers under our feet. We stood over the table for 5 minutes and not one person offered to clean it, nor did a manager show up. We looked around and saw that the entire place looked like an absolute trainwreck. There were also other guests rubber-necking looking for service. We did the smart, sensible thing -- turned around and walked out the door. There are too many restaurants nearby to get this kind of disaster of an experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville?start=20
Elizabeth D.,"Pawtucket, RI",13,11,1,5.0,5/16/2014,Stopped here for quick bite on the way back to Chicago. I'm From Rhode Island and let me say first and foremost that people are super friendly around here compared to the east. If you want crappy service come to New England. My server was sweet and accommodating. They were about to close and I was desperate. She didn't get annoyed with me for coming in 10 minutes to close. The burger was delicious (I'm biased bc I was starving). Ha! If I ever am here again I will stop here again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville?start=20
Alex B.,"Crown Point, IN",315,36,84,3.0,4/15/2014,"I really don't know what the big stink was about this place. Service was quite good by my experience. We even told are server about the time crunch we were on and received our food in no more than 5/8mins. Quite reasonable in my book. Server was super friendly and attentive. Food is OK, but I've never gone to RR for a best burger but it isn't god awful like others liked to point out. 2 downsides. We did wait at the door without being greeted right away,somewhat annoying, and the flavor in the flavored teas all just sits at the bottom no matter how much you stir. What's up with that?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville?start=20
Sean H.,"Gary, IN",0,1,,1.0,11/11/2014,When my frirnds and I ate there they only gave one person a set of silverwear and when they gave the rest of us silverwear it all had food stains on it they tried to pass off as water spots and one of my friends found a huge dead roach that's right a huge dead roach on her knife and this is all before we got our water I wouldn't suggest this place to my worse enemy so please  avoid this place at all cost DO NOT EAT THERE PLEASE,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville?start=20
Tim J.,"Manteno, IL",16,210,72,1.0,7/13/2014,"Absolutely pathetic compared to other locations. Burger was incorrect, bun incorrect with a stale storebought bun. Seventeen cold, tiny undercooked french fry nuggets, with my order...clearly this was the end of the batch in the warming bin. This burger was machine formed and not fresh beef...clearly frozen. This was not worth 13 bucks. So pathetic. STAY AWAY.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville?start=20
Jim B.,"Merrillville, IN",1,66,8,1.0,6/15/2014,"Everything I've come to expect from a chain restaurant, overpriced, low quality food.  Someone should let this restaurant know croissants have an expiration date.  Love the junk floating in the glasses too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville?start=20
Sue D.,"Homer Glen, IL",0,7,,2.0,7/13/2015,"Should have known not to stay when they said they weren't serving burgers. Their grill was down. Figured we could get soup and salad. French onion soup was like warm. Clan chowder was extremely watery. Had to ask the server to bring the soup out before the salads. The mini wedge salad did not have the blue cheese crumbles, asked for blue cheese dressing instead of ranch, they brought blue cheese dressing in a side cup, salad had ranch on it anyway. I think we would have had a better meal anywhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville?start=20
