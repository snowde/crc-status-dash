Brian B.,"Batavia, OH",0,58,8,2.0,10/5/2015,"This used to be my favorite place for a burger, after my last 3 visits, I will probably never go back.  The first foul up came when my wife and I stopped for a quick lunch without the kids.  It took an hour and fifteen minutes from start to finish, during which they had to recook both of our burgers and failed to bring us the appetizer until after the meal arrived. The second  was when my in-laws wanted to take us all out for lunch.  Upon arrival they sat us pretty far back in the restaurant and after 15 minutes of waiting there and no server interaction, we got up to leave.  At the door the manager stopped us to ask what happened and what she could do to fix it.  Our response was ""keep a better eye one what your servers are doing"" the last experience was pretty much the same as the first.  took multiple tries to get a burger out that was worth eating, and the service was severely lacking. I don't like to write a place off over one bad experience, but after 3 in a row,.....yep,..I am done",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-milford?start=20
Maria S.,"Batavia, OH",56,16,1,4.0,12/31/2015,"My husband and I come to this location all the time!  We love most things about it. The restrooms though could definitely be kept a little cleaner, in my opinion. We have had most of the servers there and they are all spectacular except for the one girl covered in tattoos with them across her chest and everything. She is pretty rude and doesn't check up on her tables. Stuff was missing from one of our orders and she was no where to be found to have them replaced. We had to ask a different server to get it for us. Anyways, the rest of the servers that we've had have all been phenomenal. We just went last night and had the guy at the bar area with the tattoos and beard. He was awesome!  Definitely one of the best we've had. Really attentive and great customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-milford?start=20
Elizabeth W.,"Springfield, OH",1,8,,5.0,9/14/2015,"I love Red Robin!! Probably because of their bottomless fries the best. As a vegetarian, I like that they have the Garden burger and Boca Vegan burger. It can be switched out on another type of burger too (like most restaurants that offer a vegetarian selection). I love their campfire sauce!!! We ate them with our onion rings and got it with our fries too!!

Scott M.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,14,1,4.0,8/29/2015,"We have eaten here a million times. Like it very much. The new makeover is good except for the no kids in the ""bar"" portion of the restaurant.   Right now I sit on a new bar policy induced wait.  The bar portion of the restaurant has tons of open tables but under 21 can't eat there.  Red Robin is a family restaurant restricting under 21 to certain parts of the restaurant is counterproductive, quite annoying, and is NOT going to turn the restaurant into some cool adult nigh spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-milford?start=20
Tim S.,"Cincinnati, OH",87,228,92,3.0,4/28/2014,"The only time I've been to this Red Robin, the TV embedded in the lobby floor was off. How the heck am I supposed to enjoy my Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Sandwich if I haven't first watched 3 minutes of sweet action sports through a hazy, thick plexiglass panel at my feet?! Despite this ominous start, I decided to press on. Whoa, the menu has a curse word in it now! Daaaaaaaaaaang Red Robin, gettin' edgy wit it! Avert the children's eyes!! Nonetheless, your expletives are powerless against me Red Robin and cannot sway me from getting my customary chicken sandwich covered in foolishly named BBQ sauce. Seriously, if there was a river made of whiskey, why would anyone be at Red Robin? We had a great, patient waitress that knew to keep her voice low when she saw the sleeping baby at our table. The kitchen did an excellent job observing all my picky omission instructions. This place was just like a Red Robin.

Ben N.,"Cincinnati, OH",133,537,40,2.0,8/8/2011,"After hearing and reading a bunch of hype about Red Robin, we decided to check it out after a movie at Milford 16.   We should've known better as soon as we stepped inside and took in the cheesy, sterile Johnny Rockets-meets-TGIF decor and atmosphere.  The interior of the restaurant looks like a pinball machine and is about as noisy as an arcade full of them, even when half full.  Kidz will probably dig it, though. The burgers are nothing special given their $8 to $10 prices.  (You do get fries or another side for your money.)  The patties are a bit thicker than the fast-food average, but thinner than what you get at the average independent burger joint.  The meat doesn't have very much flavor.  Unlike at a fast-food joint, your server will ask you how you'd like your burger cooked.  As with a fast-food joint, though, your burger will likely arrive well-done, even if you ask for medium rare.  (Or at least they did at our table on this visit.)  The mushroom-and-swiss job was pretty dry.   Service was pretty amateurish:  salad dressing left off a very perfunctory side salad (and I was halfway through the burger before a thimbleful of the stuff was brought to the table), long waits on drink refills, etc.   There is alcohol available.  Given the mediocrity of the food, the noise level (including several crying babies), and the garish visuals, guzzling a bunch of booze would have helped substantially.  But this option personally wasn't in the cards for us on this particular afternoon.   Underwhelming, overpriced, and overrated. UPDATE (6/2012):  Went back a third time because a family member actually loves this place and got to pick where we were going.  The most ridiculous thing about Red Robin is the purported availability of burgers with ""some pink,"" as opposed to a well-done hockey puck with ""no pink"" and no flavor.  Well, in three visits to this location, we've asked for a whole bunch of ""pink"" and have never seen the slightest hint of it.  Instead, we get only overcooked, juiceless, flavor-deprived ground-beef patties that are even beyond well-done.  Pathetic, seriously. Really nice service this last time, though.  Thanks, Kerri!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-milford?start=20
Christine B.,"Warsaw, KY",0,4,,1.0,11/3/2015,Food was good until I found a hair. But shit happens so I'm not the one to complain about that. Plus the manager was a cool dude & our server was a sweetheart. What I'm here to complain about is the shitty service I got from the the girl at the bar that always has an awful looking attitude every time I've ever went in there. Or maybe she just has a resting bitch face.  I wasn't even sitting in the bar so you'd think she wouldn't have too much to complain about but she sure did. We ordered 2 Frozen mixed drink that were poorly made. Were hardly even frozen because she didnt even use the proper amount of servings. I went up there myself ( Nicely) to get new drinks made.... that were also made poorly but they were better than the previous ones so it's whatever.   Went on my way with my new drinks while she continued to talk shit to her other employees about me ... or maybe the fact that her life sucks & is too lazy to complete her job with an OK attitude. I would have understood a bit more if it was at the end of night and you were just so over making drinks but come onnnn.. you can't suck that bad all the time lol Ps. I'm a bartender also & I don't even suck that bad on the worst of days.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-milford?start=20
Natashia P.,"Cincinnati, OH",1,18,1,1.0,7/17/2014,"The weekend of July 4th, we had some friends in from out of town and seeing as Red Robin is a fan favorite among our group, the six of us decided to stop by for lunch on Sunday. I am seriously regretting that decision after our experience that day. We were seated right away by a very inviting hostess who mentioned the dessert special for Red Robin members. Following this, our waitress (I will leave her name out) came to take our orders, but did not seem very interested to be at our table. It took an overly long time for us to get our food from the kitchen. When we got our orders, we found out why. All of our meals were lukewarm. Not one was warm, so they weren't waiting on one to be finished before bringing it to us. It most likely sat on the counter until our waitress got around to bringing it out to us. The food, despite being lukewarm, was still delicious, so I commend the kitchen. Our waitress was cordial, but not willing to do more than she must to get our service. My boyfriend asked for more fries, which we got not too long after. But when one of the other couples asked for fries and I asked for more fruit not five minutes later, it took over 30 minutes for her to bring it to us. I timed it; and during this time period, I saw our waitress in the kitchen area messing around with another server. She was placing clips in his hair and putting her hands in his hair. I watched her afterwards to see if she would wash her hands or go to the restroom where she may have washed her hands and she didn't. Disgusting! Everyone at the table was finished with our food and all of our drinks had been empty for ten minutes before our waitress finally brought the fries and fruit. She set it down and was getting ready to walk away before I spoke up and asked for drink refills for the table. To top it off, the fruit she brought me was bad. The third couple in our party was also going to ask for a refill of fries, but decided against it after she took so long. To top it off, it seemed the waitress was really rushing us out the door. She brought us our checks without asking if anyone wanted dessert. I had to stop her before she handed the receipts out to say that we all wanted to order dessert (two of us had the member cards and were getting the special deal). We ordered our dessert to go as we were concerned it would take us another hour to get out of there. And then we didn't even get a proper receipt to take with us, so there is no telling if she actually corrected the receipts or not. I was appalled at the terrible service. If we hadn't had friends visiting us, I would have found a manager that day to complain. Red Robin is a favorite among our group, but I can safely say that all six of us will think twice before coming by again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-milford?start=20
Mark F.,"Cincinnati, OH",130,447,226,2.0,9/28/2011,"For this place to use the word gourmet next to burger is anathema in this town with so many other finer places than this wannabe franchise. From Flipdaddy's top notch beers and burgers with sides like asparagus to Terry's Turf Club, etc. etc. this is not the place to get Cincinnati's ""Gourmet Burger"" For the best burger meat, go to Sonny's 3 Meat Burgers on Beechmont in Anderson. ($6 includes all toppings and unlimited fries). For a hipsters joint/bar hangout with good burgers that can include crab, lobster, shrimp or over a dozen imported cheese, Terry's in East End, but you will pay about $20 to $35 per plate not counting drinks and sides.  But don't ever waste your time and money at a place like Dead Robin. Even Ruby Tuesday's just 200 yards down the street has a Prime Beef burger that can be cooked rare and done up however you like with the basics and it will be head over heals better than Dead Robin's sorry burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-milford?start=20
Chad S.,"Milford, OH",36,109,105,3.0,12/27/2013,"A great spot to watch the football game on Sunday!  There was nobody in the bar (granted, it was the weekend before Christmas, and maybe people were doing other things).  But we were happy  to sit in the bar, order a drink and lunch.   The meal was cooked quickly and the staff was friendly, checking in on us often.  I ordered the Whiskey River Barbecue Cheeseburger with Bottomless Sweet Potato Fries. The burger was good.  If you like barbecue sauce, this sauce was a little too sweet for me.  The sweet potato fries cost $1.50 extra, but I think it was worth it- especially  paired with the barbecue sauce from my burger. This place must be popular for birthdays, because I swear I heard the loud clapping birthday song at least 4 times while I was there. TIP: Since the fries are bottomless, have one person in your party order regular fries and another person order sweet potato fries so that you can snack on both.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-milford?start=20
Ken U.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,4,,3.0,5/6/2015,"Went on a sunday afternoon party of three. Service was slow. Once we ordered, it took over 20 minutes to get our food for a basic order of three bacon cheeseburgers. Nothing fancy The food was decent. Noise level was high. Waitress kept bringing drink refills. After the long wait for the food, I had to ask for another order of the so called endless fries because if I waited on the server I would have died from starvation first. Taste vs. the price?

It was very overpriced at $5.79 for a pint. Don't go there expecting interesting microbrews as I did.  The Tavern Burger  I got was extremely over salted -- to the point that I couldn't eat 2/3 of it.  The server WAS extremely attentive.  He very quickly brought new fries when the original ones weren't hot.  My only criticisms: 1) When I asked him about getting extra toppings on my burger he said, ""You can get anything you want.""

Andrew H.,"Cincinnati, OH",134,101,,4.0,2/22/2012,"Red Robin...I'll just sum it up like this. It's one of the best burgers I ever had. I've had Five Guys before, and it's one of the best I've had as well, but keep in mind that I've never had the pleasure to experience Quatman's, Terry's Turf Club, or any other of those burger joints I hear people going on and on about.  I had the Whiskey River BBQ burger...BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, onion straws, lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise. Hold the lettuce, mayo and tomato. Done medium well. It was a damn good burger though it cost me almost $10. The plus side to all this is that bottomless steak fries come with it, so it makes the $10 seem like a good deal.  It's a good little joint, with a solid product, and a good option for those looking to eat on the eastside of town or before going to the movies nearby. Service was solid, quick prompt attention with a friendly wait staff. This place is always packed at night and on the weekends.

Otherwise you can't go wrong. They don't really advertise the garlic cheese fries but those are super awesome. The only complaint I have about this place is the noise level. I rarely leave there without feeling like I've just seen AC/DC at US Bank arena or whatever they're calling it when you read this. I whipped open the decibel meter app on my phone and it registered a constant 90 to 95 and even hit 110 when the birthday singers came out which was every 5 minutes.

Cons: a bit pricey for a family burger meal If you're just talking about the food, to me Red Robin has a better selection of gourmet burger options and taste as good as some of the more trendy local joints, and I don't have to sit shoulder to shoulder with complete strangers (though that can be fun too as long as they've bathed).

Cindy W.,"Cincinnati, OH",221,116,610,2.0,1/12/2018,"As of December/January 2018: We have attended twice in the past month, and unfortunately things have changed for this restaurant.  This is the second time that we have returned and sat in the bar area only to wait forever for fries, refills on our drinks, and our food. Our server was quite busy, as he/she was responsible to wait on the customers at the bar, make drinks for the entire restaurant, and serve our food. Last night, he had about six tables and an additional six people at the bar. He was expected to serve us all. Kudos for him for trying--but that is way too much pressure to put on him. We did not get refills of drinks nor what we needed. I was also sorely disappointed in the bathrooms. When I visited in December, they were pretty bad. When I returned in January, nothing had changed. It was very dirty. They were out of paper towels in the girls restroom. Three people told the staff and an hour later, they were still no paper towels in the bathroom. Unfortunately, the food was not cooked well. Plus, the avocado I ordered was already brown. I had to go to the kitchen to get a side of mayonnaise because my server was too busy. Bummer, for I love Red Robin! I do not think I will be back to this location.

Tabitha W.,"Cincinnati, OH",73,401,960,4.0,9/19/2013,"While Red Robin's claim to fame is their gourmet burgers, I find them a bit more run-of-the-mill American chain restaurant. Which isn't always a bad thing.  After an afternoon spent at the Old West Fest, we were pretty hungry, so we decided to stop here since it was along the way.  While I wouldn't call them 'gourmet', I do give them points for their sizable burger selection.  Pretty much everything is customizable. They offer a Gardenburger or you can get the BOCA Original Vegan Burger (I opt for BOCA every time now that that's an option.)  All burgers come with unlimited fries, which is a nice bonus.   Red Robin is another restaurant that's jumped on the small plate bandwagon, a notion I love. We tried the the Yukon Chips & French Onion Dip - they were good but nothing too special.  We also got a side of Mac 'N' Cheese - that was probably the worst part of the meal. The cheese just didn't seem to be adhering to the pasta right and it just all around lacked flavor.   This location was clean and resembled every other Red Robin I've ever been to. Always a decent option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-milford
Katie K.,"Cincinnati, OH",116,160,1,4.0,3/13/2016,"We enjoyed our experience! Great service and good food. My banzai veggie burger was good and I enjoyed the steak fries. My boyfriend had a chicken sandwich the that he said was mediocre, the chicken was chewy in some areas, but the sweet potato fries were delicious! We will be back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-milford
T S.,"Milford, OH",0,24,,4.0,7/21/2016,"Well my previous visits have been so-so but i went again with my family to get a birthday burger.  I got the big tavern ghost burger and was actually very happy with it !  it is the best burger i have had there.  It is quite spicy and that was what i was hoping for, so yay. My son had the Ensenada Chicken Platter.  He was looking for something he liked that was also low in fat and calories and he said he will get this meal every time now. The place was mostly empty so service was fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-milford
Jenni H.,"Milford, OH",26,250,21,3.0,1/28/2014,"I'm not even sure its fair for me to do a Yelp on this place.....most people seem to think this place is great....i have to be honest, I don't get it!   It's clean, the service is pretty great, the portions are good.  But the taste vs. the price?  Me thinks not.   When I leave here I think, ""are you kidding me with THAT bill??""   I just don't think taste is worth price here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-milford
Andy P.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,18,,1.0,11/28/2015,First they brought a strawberry lemonade with a hair melded into the strawberries. Pretty gross. Then they brought wrong food to the table. Fries were cold. Onions on the burger were gross. And the prices are unbelievable. Red Robin yyyuuuucccckkk. You're garbage. 0 out of 5.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-milford
David ..,"Milford, OH",0,42,1,4.0,9/21/2016,"I had the Banzai burger and it's my favorite so far.  We had a nice waitress and the manager was nice, checking on us a couple of times.

Dexter M.,"Marietta, GA",0,11,,3.0,9/11/2016,Service was very good.  Very noisy.  The food was OK.  I left wishing I'd gone to the Wendy's next door.  Meh.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-milford
Nick S.,"Cincinnati, OH",31,50,9,3.0,10/19/2015,"Went here with a coworker not too long ago and I have experienced a Red Robin before. This location was still very good but they as many restaurants are doing now going to the pay at the table business. I feel like servers are much more apt to be nicer and go out of there way for you when there isn't a machine at the table that customers pay on. It cuts down on the level of service significantly. The food was still up to par with other Red Robins, the service just wasn't what I am normally used to. Hopefully the machines don't stay so they can go back to having great service again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-milford
