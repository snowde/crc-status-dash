Colton C.,"Shrewsbury, MA",169,156,57,4.0,12/5/2017,"I love Red Robin! Definitely affordable especially if you want something under $15 for a burger meal! We went on a busy Thursday night and still had really good service: pretty speeedy and our server was SO nice.  I ordered the burger that doesn't have a bun, but a lettuce bun thing! Interesting and good! Especially the bacon.  My husband ordered a different burger and got the sweet potato fries with his. Yummy! A bit salty but still good.  I only give this 4 stars since it wasn't anything out of the ordinary but a decent place, good food and good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury
Anthony H.,"Largo, FL",113,164,224,3.0,12/27/2017,"This place is really just alright and that's pretty much it. Their food is like just okay, it's not bad and it's not great. Right in the middle. Nothing to write home about...  I would probably go back if I had a friend who really wanted to go, but it wouldn't be my first, my second, or third choice, or even in my top 10.   Sorry for such a crappy review but there's not much to say.

Tina V.,"Worcester, MA",302,43,99,5.0,10/26/2017,"Red Robin is such a go-to for me & my bf! The best part is the bottomless steak fries. Not only that, but the special seasoning, campfire sauce, & spicy ketchup sauce are to die for. I legitimately crave this at least every other day, it's awful.  I also love the raspberry tea. It is refreshing because there's a hint of raspberry, & nowhere near too sweet.  I change the burger I get each time, they've all tasted good to me! Last night I had the siracha double tavern, super delish. You can replace the buns with a lettuce wrap to be a little healthier. Wait staff is always nice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury
Mark C.,"Millbury, MA",4,60,,3.0,7/30/2017,"I've been here several times, hoping it becomes more than it is.  The burgers are ok.  Nothing to write home about.  They keep pushing the bottomless fries.  That would be great if they were good.  I guess all in all I'm not a fan.  I have always found the staff to be courteous so that's a plus.  Worth a try for yourself.  An employee of mine loves it there.

Leda B.,"Danbury, CT",2,64,17,2.0,12/2/2017,During the holidays I understand that restaurants become very busy because I use to work in a few. I went at a time where there was hardly a wait and so we got sat. I love my burgers and fries so I was really excited. We were waiting for a bit and looking around and didn't get service for some time. I guess our waitress was behind and couldn't handle a table so she handed us over to another waitress which was okay with us and was friendly. Fine. Service was nice but food was mediocre at best. The best tasting thing I ordered was the silver patron margarita. Burger was super small and over advertised on the menu and the fries were under seasoned. I've been here plenty of times and it really is a hit or miss. Left our waitress a nice tip because of great service and being attentive. Come here at your own discretion.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury
Warren L.,"Northborough, MA",19,20,,2.0,11/7/2017,"Typical corporate restaurant easily filled up by shoppers and transients.  Like array of burger creations a vegetarian can select and keep those fries coming.  Like the strawberry lemonade.  I like this restaurant, by prefer locally owned, intimate settings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury
E T.,"West Hollywood, CA",28,453,164,2.0,6/17/2017,"I remember seeing all the ads on television when Red Robin started to break into the New England market from it's Midwest stronghold. At one time I remember there was an hour wait to get a table for the first 6 months any Red Robin opened. Then came Burger Fi, Five Guys, Smash Burger, Walbergers, Crunch Burger, Unami Burger ... You get the idea. Foodies jumped the burger bandwagon as they did with grilled cheese, Pho and cronuts. The attention span of a foodie is a couple of go arounds of the old goldfish bowl before Cola Marinated Pork Bahn Mi, Vietnamese Lettuce Cups and truffle fries and all the other 'hot items' go in and come out in less than a year's time. Cue poor Red Robin who jumped into the burger revolution with both feet only to realize the pool was slowly draining. Cut to the interior of Red Robin in Millbury, MA. The bar has a couple hipsters fresh off their shift at Nordstrom Rack or Pier One. A small handful of families and teens scatter the cavernous dining space. Yep ... No hour wait here unless you are talking post Black Friday Christmas shopping. The burgers here are no better or worse than you'd find at Denny's or TGIFridays or Applebee's. It's a greasy 75/25 Burger mix ... Packaged grocery store style buns ... Barely any seasoning (the secret to Shake Shack's success is dredging their burgers in salt and pepper seasoning). My lettuce was wilty and blah. They forgot to put mustard and mayo on the burger. It was the least memorable part of my meal and the too thick tomato slice made the burger a runny mess. The milkshake was pathetic. A barely blended mess with the bottom full of giant pieces of Oreos and the top a melty vanilla ice cream. The best shake in the business belongs to Chick Filet. The worst ... Red Robin. I'd seriously rather have a Mcflurry than the glass of broken cookies and runny too sweet ice cream at Red Robin. The best part of the meal was the fries. Unlimited steak fries ... I ate more than I should of because the main parts of my meal sucked so bad. The fries were crispy but my guess is whoever was supposed to season the food was on break while I was there because they were bland like cardboard until I drenched them in Heinz ketchup. They played odd 1980s music ... Not even the upbeat stuff though. It was more a melancholy mix of Cindi Lauper's slow songs, Areosmith love ballads and other sad songs you'd want to hear more during a slow dance at a prom than a sadly empty burger joint on a Saturday night. For families who want a burger and fries for the kids after shopping or for teens who need a spot to grab a $12 burger before seeing a movie next door ... This will do the trick. However all else will leave feeling worse than when they came in. That's the worst kind of burger, the kind where the thought of ordering it is the most satisfying part of eating it. Sorry Red Robin ... My commercial would not say 'Reeeed Robin. Yuuuum!' It would say 'Reeeed Robin. Blaaah'",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury
Ravuth O.,"Providence, RI",30,80,185,3.0,4/30/2017,"The burgers are great juicy and tender. It is obvious they are good at what they do. Their bottomless fries are a great enticement to eat there. I recommended getting the smoke and pepper ketchup as a condiment to dip the fries in . The Banzai burger (Glazed in teriyaki and topped with grilled pineapple, Cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes and mayo) and the Wedgie Burger (Stacked with bacon, guac, tomato and red onion inside of a lettuce bun) are my favorites. Pair with a blue moon like the menu recommends. I wish the waitresses that work there were more friendly and attentive to their customers or else they would get 4 stars instead of 3.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury
Jeff A.,"Portsmouth, RI",0,11,,1.0,9/23/2017,Went here with my family and was very disappointed. The server was actually very good in terms of service and pleasantries. I ordered a lettuced wrapped cheese burger because burgers are what Red Robin is supposed to be famous. My wife ordered a chicken sandwich. It took 1 hour for us to get our food. When we did receive it 2 orders came out than 10 mins later the other 2 came out. My burger was burnt. It was simply horrible My wife's chicken was also burnt. Quality control is certainly an issue here-who s the manager? Really a terrible experience avoid at all cost.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury

It was a busy Friday night.  We waited about 30 minutes for a table which seemed reasonable. Once seated our waitress was here quickly asking about drinks.  Very friendly. We ordered drinks. They came pretty quickly for being so busy.  We ordered a tower of onion rings for an app.   Then we placed our burger orders.  The rings were awesome. The burgers were all very good. The fries weren't exactly my favorite, but that's just a personal taste thing. Overall a good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury
Tim C.,"Millbury, MA",2,14,,2.0,7/14/2017,"This Red Robin location is at the Blackstone Valley Mall and it is almost always packed, especially on Friday and Saturday nights, expect a wait. Service is a bit below average . The prices are average, but my experience with the food is not very good. I've come on many different occasions, I usually try a different burger every time. Every burger I received had been overcooked, the buns were soggy and it would fall apart as soon as I received it. I decided I would stop venturing to this business and try some of the other resteraunts at the mall. Would not recommend!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury
Laura D.,"Brighton, MA",162,309,324,4.0,6/20/2015,"Stopped by to redeem my birthday burger and after getting shuffled around a few times I was able to get it to-go! The staff was very courteous and brought it out to me when it was done in a perfectly assembled to-go package.  The burger (standard Red Robin gourmet, medium) was tasty, although I wish they would stop using shredded lettuce. I'm not a fan of their steak fries, but even less a fan of paying extra for sweet potato...

Chris g.,"Spencer, MA",32,25,,3.0,8/28/2016,"So, let's start with the food. It was all good. My burger was cooked perfectly, and was exactly what I was looking for. My wife's was as well. My daughter's Mac and cheese was a little light on the quantity of Mac and cheese, but the quality was there. Where the restaurant loses two stars is the service, and the management. First of all, I understand a kitchen can be slow. When that happens, it's the front of the house's job to make up for it. My waitress was slow. Drink refills took forever. Bottomless drinks can only be bottomless if someone comes back to check on them. Same is true of never ending French fries. If you never come back, that's an empty promise. I think a large part of this falls on management. When we were leaving, there were several people waiting to be seated, a gaggle of wait staff and hostesses at the front door, and a dozen or more open tables. If I'm the manager, I'm sitting these people, pulling those waiters off the front desk, and adding an extra staff to the bar. That's a whole lot of missed drinking going on.

That's until I was roped into signing up for the loyalty program some months ago and the coupons pulled me in.  This RR is located in a huge shopping plaza. Tons of stores of a vast variety to shop at so nicely placed. It also is the closest RR for miles in Mass They make a pretty good gourmet burger for a chain.

Rick S.,"Worcester, MA",0,39,,4.0,6/12/2017,"I give this restaurant 4 stars as a place to bring children. We went with my young nephews this weekend.  Red Robin genuinely accepts children and does its best to accommodate them.  Liz C, our server, went above and beyond to ask our needs and meet them.  There just aren't that many places catering to kids nowadays.  At least ones I am happy to go to as an adult. I am a huge fan of their Smoke & Pepper burger.  I hope they never take it off the menu.  The hamburger meat on all their sandwiches is excellent.  They clearly season the meat and cook it correctly whenever we go.  I am also a huge fan of the bottomless fries and drinks. I have always wanted to go here late-night after a movie to binge on their great adult-drink concoctions and bottomless everything...  When the children aren't there.  Maybe sometime soon. They were renovating the location while we were there.  Other than smelling a new coat of paint, it was hard to see anything that would have affected our visit negatively.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury

Jim H.,"Marlborough, MA",68,99,9,3.0,8/18/2016,"Red Robin has been a staple for myself and my wife whenever we're in the mood for burgers. This place really knows how to make them. For the most part their food is great, the garlic fries are delicious, and the atmosphere is wonderful.  Each time we've been there, the waitstaff has been absolutely a joy to deal with and really friendly.  So why then the three stars? Well... First off all, every single time we've been to this place, whenever we get our fries refilled, we NEVER get the same fries back. Instead of more garlic fries, we get plain fries. Well we send them back, and get what we ordered, which is fine, it comes back without issue. So it's a minor issue.  My main issue that takes two stars away from this place are when they try to 'experiment.' What I mean by that is that they try to create new burgers using ingredients that you normally wouldn't see. These are really hit or miss... and unfortunately more miss than anything. After two bad burgers, I just order off the normal menu now.  So which burgers were they? Habanero Burger: Okay, I'm not a wuss when it comes to hot. I have a bottle of something called Satan's Blood at home, a drop of which would make most people pass out. That being said, if you're going to cook hot food, you need to know exactly how hot to make something. This burger is made with jalapenos, and a Habanero paste as the sauce. The burger is so hot that it has no flavor. The heat is way too overpowering. It's not intolerably hot, it's just like you get the blast of heat and then no taste to it. Needless to say, I'm not ordering that again.  Then I tried the Ramen burger... Oh man... the Ramen burger... All right, so this is a burger where bun is made from cooked noodles that appear to be mixed with a bit of egg, pressed into a bun shape, and then cooked. The burger itself is topped with Teriyaki and Chiu Chow aioli, fried jalapeño coins, chili-infused shredded cabbage, carrot and onion and fresh basil for garnish.Sounds great right?  Like most of us who went to college, I was on a Ramen diet for a few years... and I'm still seeing a doctor about it! ;)  Anyway, I thought I'd give this a try to relive some nostalgia and try something new like I always do. This burger was NASTY!!!! The crisp outside of the bun hid overly moist noodles... too moist, and lacking in any real flavor. The blandness even overpowered the burger and it's toppings.  If that wasn't bad enough, I came down with a stomach ache soon after I ate it.  In Summation, the food here is great, just try to avoid the burgers where they try something new. It hasn't worked out very well and thankfully, it appears that these burgers are no longer on their menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury?start=20
Jennifer A.,"Uxbridge, MA",38,24,2,1.0,5/15/2017,"On mothers day 2017 We waited ten minutes in the front with my mother, my partner and four year old son.

Waiter claimed to put in order for mac and cheese as he brought our drinks. We then ordered our meals and waited for the food... Not once did the waiter check on us.

Christine H.,"Westborough, MA",63,177,32,2.0,2/28/2016,"There is nothing ""gourmet"" about their burgers. It never ceases to amaze me how much crappy quality food/drinks can stick these adjectives in their business names/advertising and get away with it. Sauces are bland, cheeses don't taste like much, and buns are garden variety dry and tasteless. Tiny burgers, not cooked correctly (dry as hell) and the portions are tiny. For 11 bucks, I can buy 1.5 pounds of meat and appropriate burger accoutrements that taste better and feed about 6 people. Heck, potatoes for french fries are pretty cheap, too. In other words - rip-off. Total rip-off. The servers seem to be well-trained and the amount of milkshake you get is no joke.

Lynn R.,"Leicester, MA",5,103,303,4.0,3/6/2016,"On this last Saturday of February, it was very busy (we waited 25 - 30 minutes for our booth even though it was past prime lunch time); the restaurant was packed with children and very loud, even for a Red Robin.  Our young server was very pleasant and efficient, taking and delivering or order in a most timely fashion.  Both of our ""Bleu Ribbon"" burgers were excellent---juicy and flavorful even in their overcooked states (we usually like our burgers cooked to medium-rare, but chain rules dictate that the servers ask, ""Would you like your burger cooked with some pink or no pink?""  Ours arrived with some pink).  The flavor and texture combinations of this burger make it, in my opinion, one of Red Robin's very best.  They were served, of course, with a ""bottomless"" supply of their very average but seasoned nicely, steak-cut fries (we only eat what we are initially given, and we've never asked for more).  We should have opted for the la carte side/appetizer of ""Towering Onion Rings.""  I enviously eyed many neighboring tables being served these delicious-looking mountains of badness, but to this day, I have never tried one.  Upon my next visit, I surely will, even at the price of nine bucks.  We both ordered Gold Peak peach iced teas, which were nice and refreshing.   Yes, prices have gone up and seem a bit steep for an overcooked, albeit still tasty and very filling, burger.  We deem Red Robin a decent dining choice while shopping at the Shoppes at Blackstone Valley.  We could have had much worse, given some of the other chain options in the plazas.  Without a doubt, we'll return for more burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury?start=20

My fellow diners each ordered burgers, medium-well, off the menu. Both enjoyed them. One commented on a lack of fries and the other reminded him of the free bottomless steak fries.

It's large and even the entry way is huge and doesn't effect in crowds and crowds of people at the other location.  Another great things about this place is the friendly, quick, kind service. All employees are right on top of everything and seem to do an amazing of job of making customers happy and satisfied (and full for that matter), as well as keeping the restaurant in clean condition and well maintained.  Great food. Enough said here... if you haven't been to Red Robin, get a burger and a stack of onion rings. The best part of the menu. Prices are slightly more than the servings suggest, however, it's still a great choice.  Probably best choice for food in Shoppes @ Blackstone Valley, since the service is so consistent and the food is so great. 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury?start=20

She'd come here every day if I let her. I have a Groupon I have tried to use the last two weeks and if I didn't know better, I'd say there some special force reaching into my phone and my Groupon App, and deliberately screwing up our order and keeping my bill too low to use it. Last week it was serving our burgers to the wrong table, this week it was forgetting to bring our appetizer. In each instance, customer service was great. Both servers were extremely apologetic and quickly, or as quick as possible, corrected the error and in both cases comped our appetizer. A suggestion to RR Management, how about having only one server both take the order and deliver the food, it may just cut down on the mistakes, just saying,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury?start=20

Joe B.,"Shrewsbury, MA",0,11,,4.0,12/28/2015,Went here Sunday 12/17/15 at 6.  They were busy about 90% full.  We ask for a booth and they said they did not have any open. Right in front of us was a empty booth so we asked to sit there. We were told there was no server for the booth (with slight attitude). We insisted they send the waitress to the booth for us and she agreed. We have two young children so a booth is much easier. My wife and I both ordered burgers and they were delicious! The waitress offered to bring out the kids meals early which she did and it worked out very well. Kid friendly!! I ordered dessert but they said the freezer was broken and they were unable to serve the desert I ordered. Sit us at the open booth and serve my dessert for the 5 stars.

The service has also hit rock bottom. I recently visited Red Robin Millbury on a Tues for lunch. The restaurant was by no means busy yet I waited more than 45 minutes for my meal. I didn't order anything special; just a burger. While I was waiting for my food I saw 5 or so meals sitting under the heat lamps for more than 10 minutes. Wonder how those tasted?

It took forever to get me another sandwich and the manager didn't even come over to apologize or take the sandwich off the bill.  The next few times we went I decided to try the burgers since they have a great selection. But each of these times there were problems either the food took for ever or the food was cold when it came to the table, like the food was either sitting there for a while or the burgers weren't made fresh but cooked earlier.

Maureen L.,"Shrewsbury, MA",44,17,5,2.0,2/8/2014,"My family ventured out this afternoon.  We had some errands at Blackstone Valley, so we thought we would treat them to lunch at Red Robin.  The girls love Red Robin, but my husband and I are not too impressed.   We showed up on a Saturday at about 1:30 in the afternoon.  The place was packed.  We waited for close to 30 minutes.  You would think this was the only sit-down restaurant in the plaza, but that's far from the case.   We ordered chips with salsa and guacamole as an appetizer.  This was a ridiculous letdown.  I was envisioning a large basket of chips for my family to share, with cups of salsa and guacamole.  We received approximately 15 chips and tiny plastic containers with chunky salsa and brown guac.  Now, obviously, Red Robin is not a Mexican restaurant, but if you are going to have salsa and guac on the menu, do it right.  Now, we were still hungry after our approximately 3 chips apiece, and I asked for more.  The waitress said no problem, and then didn't bring the chips out until we were halfway through with our meal.  She did not tell us that there was going to be a charge for them, and it was not worth arguing about because who wants to be the cheapskate arguing about $1.29 for more chips?  It was very annoying that the initial portion was not sufficient, and then the refill portion didn't appear until we were busy with our entrees.      The restaurant was very busy, and service was slow.  There were several times when the waitress stopped at the table next to us- a party of three, and did not check in with my party of five.  I will say that she was very nice and attentive when she did come by.   The girls all ordered corndogs, and were happy with their meals.  I tried out the new smoke and pepper burger, and my husband had the Whiskey River burger.  We were happy with our burgers, and finished them.  They were filling, and we did not need to eat much dinner tonight.  In terms of taste, we prefer Five Guys or Shake Shack for our burgers.   We probably won't return any time soon.  The last time we were here was around my birthday in September when I had a free burger coupon.  We had problems with my mother-in-law's order on that visit, and while the issues were addressed quickly, I'm afraid that it's two strikes too many for Red Robin.  The food isn't worth the crowds and slow service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury?start=40

Stephanie A.,"Rockport, ME",0,15,,1.0,5/21/2014,"I will never eat at a Red Robin again.  Yesterday, a TUESDAY night, my boyfriend and I decided that after both having long, stressful days at work, we'd rather go out and grab a quick bite to eat then to cook. I stupidly suggested going to Red Robin over all the other eating options in the same shopping center. What a mistake.  We arrived and we're seated around 7:30. The place was dead, but yet, it took our waiter, ""Chris"" 10 minutes to actually get to our table. We decided to order everything (two drinks, an appetizer and our two burgers) once he got there because we didn't want to order our drinks and have to wait 10 more minutes to get the rest of our order. Unfortunately, that didn't stop the whole night from becoming a clusterfuck of incompetence.  We waited 15 minutes for our drinks after we ordered them. I literally would look at the bar and see our drinks sitting there. The bar tender had to stop what she was doing and give us our drink because our waiter was clearly not going to give them to us. By the time we got our drinks, mine (are frozen cocktail) was melted, watery and gross. My boyfriend's beer was on the flat side.  It wasn't until after 8 did we get our appetizer, fried zucchini and it was the best thing we got to eat, unfortunately, they were greasy and we had no napkins or silverware, though we requested some from Chris twice (when we got our appetizer and when he followed up on us while we were eating it). We didn't get any until I got up, went to him and asked for a third time.  It was 8:36 when our waiter informed us that he ""forgot"" to put our food order in (we should have been getting our check by then!) and that it would be a few more minutes. Yeah, right. By few minutes, I guess he meant a half an hour because it was past 9 when we finally got our food. He apologized for the wait with the lame-ass excuse ""someone in the kitchen doesn't like me and didn't tell me the orders were up"" I'm like 100% sure it's the waiters' responsibility to keep track of their orders, not the back. Incompetence at its finest. Our food was cold, the buns were soggy. It was a shame because our burgers looked like they were cooked the way we wanted them, but seeing they were sitting around for 30+ minutes the heat ended up cooking them through. It was fucking gross and we ate maybe three bites because we were starving.  We had to flag him over to get our check. After a long day and having to deal with this incompetent fool, I was getting visibly pissed off. He quickly got our check, but when I gave him my card, rather than take it and run it, he goes to the CLEAN table next to ours and wipes it down like to pretend he's been so fucking busy or something, even though we saw him dicking around and picking at his fingers half of the night.  I can't believe we were out for three hours when we wanted to be out for only one.  If management is reading this : fire these useless, incompetent slackers. Maybe then you'll actually get some customers rather everyone going to the TGI Friday's across the street.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury?start=40

You better stay away from him.' blah blah blah. I asked why this person was so concerned and why they wasted my time, unless this was his gf and she wanted to warn the anonymous patron, who has no way of contacting him, to stay away. Or he himself was just being a dick. This person claimed to be a friend of his and that he always play jokes on HIM... by texting ME, a paying customer, and wasting my time??? Really?!

Christopher S.,"West Newton, MA",5,224,311,1.0,7/10/2009,"One of my friends from home suggested we try Red Robin for dinner because she's been to the one in Pennsylvania and enjoyed it.  Feeling bold and wanting to try something different I said, ""okay,"" and we made the drive out to Millbury.  Well, being a Friday night it was packed full with shoppers or teenagers from the movie theater next door.  The wait was about 45 minutes and as we patiently passed time we couldn't help but notice a half booth randomly in the waiting area.  I said to myself, ""Surely, that isn't a real seating location for customers.""  We had no idea the hell of a night we were in for.   Our name was called and we were placed at the half booth...great..!  This table sits just outside the bar and within the entryway.  Customers waiting to be seated were over my shoulder and some were even standing in front of our table!  I asked the waitress if we could please be reseated because we were so uncomfortable.  She said she would check but unfortunately being a Friday night it was not possible.  We felt like we were segregated from the entire restaurant like Sharon and Susan from the Parent Trap movie.  Our meal was less than enjoyable because of the atmosphere.   As soon as I went home I wrote to Red Robin about my terrible evening and was quickly contacted by the manager from Millbury.  He said he would give me and my friend a free meal to make up for our last experience.  Not passing up a free meal I said okay and gave them another shot.  Well, we were seating at a table with all the other diners this time but the manager who wrote to me didn't even come by to check on us.  If it were me I would have made sure that two displeased customers were getting treated better for their second visit.     As far as food goes this place is just the same as any other burger joint trying to spice up something new.  I wouldn't say Red Robin is anything to rave about and being in a very large shopping area it's the same as being in a busy food court.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury?start=80

Anne S.,"Middlefield, CT",2,109,,1.0,5/2/2012,"I haven't been this disappointed in a very long time with a meal I had.  We actually came here twice.  The only reason for the second visit is, that, the first was for milkshakes and chicken wings.  I did have a buger but wondered, what is wrong with this?  So, here we go, trying for the second time because the kids liked the atmosphere--which I liked too. We ordered the wings.  Good.  The milkshakes.  Good.  Aaaahh.  That tower of rings kept calling to us.  I asked this question to the waitress, "" are they the kind of onion rings that when you bite into them, the onion comes out completely?""  A fair question for a foodie to ask.  ""They are famous"", was the answer.  Once we got them, we realised it was famous for being a tower of s#t.  One bite, out came the soggy slice of onion and you are left with the fried carcass of the onion ring.  For 7 or 8 dollars, you bet I was mad. They advertise on the menu and on t.v how famous the burgers are.  Did you see the commercial for the $6.99 burger and all u can eat fries?  well, you don't see that in here. (7.99-9.99) The famous burger.  Yummm, a frozen 1/4 pound burger placed on a conveyer belt ( yes, that is what we were told there).  It came out burnt twice--I value my teeth, not ready to break them.  And knowing that I, myself, could throw one of these frozen patties on the pan for about 50 cents really burns my biscuit.  The steak fries are so big and unappetizing.  Frozen fries deep fried.  Can't wait.  For the quality, for the price, this should be a place where you walk up to the window and place your order.  The burger should be about $3.59. Go to Uno's next door.  They have a nice burger for the same price.  Go to the Lonestar at the end of the plaza.  They have great burgers--1/2 pounders, fresh, for the same price.  If you don't know the difference between good food and total overpriced crap, go to Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury?start=60
K K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,1,1.0,7/26/2014,"Ordered take out twice - this review is a combo of both experiences: First time I ordered take out in June: My order was incorrectly filled and the ""endless"" fries ended up being exactly 12 fries to go with my burger. at least fill the box halfway! geez! I complained to guest relations who emailed back and said she spoke with the manager and assured me that extra training was being done to ensure the right order.  I went back today for takeout again wanting to give them a second chance, guess what? Wrong order .... Again!!  I asked for the Tavern Double cheese burger and they charged me for a regular cheeseburger and charged me for an extra patty. Wow so give me the wrong order and bill me extra for it? It wasn't that good (ever heard of seasoning?) and my wife's Chicken bruschetta burger was ehhh. At least I got 15 fries this time... wooohooo, partyyyyy!  Overall I can see why this place gets consistently poor reviews. The fact that the order was completely wrong was just another example of corporations like Red Robin spending millions on commercials about the quality of the food only to experience the lack of follow through on the delivery of that quality. I am told to call the restaurant but what are they going to do? Make me drive back and waste more time to fix the order they couldn't get right in the first place?  I could call and get my money back but I ate the food - that's not the issue. As a previous manager myself, I know that the standards set by corporate office are set for a reason, yet very rarely are they followed through these days as evidenced by the meal I received. I've learned a long time ago with restaurants like Red Robin that calling the store rarely brings change - just words. It's not about appeasement - it's about following through on the corporate standards to ensure that every patron gets the high quality product promised. Red Robin hs missed the mark twice and I for one will never go back and encourage others to not go either until corporations have respect for their patrons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury?start=60

Terri S.,"Worcester, MA",33,41,6,1.0,1/6/2014,"I've been here twice now and the first time went without a hitch but this past encounter has sealed the ""will never return here"" deal. The waitstaff needs some real mentoring here.  Our waitress was inattentive and rude and I understood that the dining room was full and it was busy but when I ask how much longer on the food when I have to flag you down to get a refill on my soda the correct answer isn't ""The kitchen's really busy and they keep screwing things up."" That should have been a sign to cancel our order and leave but we waited....and waited... it was about 40 minuted before we got our burgers and they were wrong. Not horribly wrong like they belonged to a different table just wrong enough that she had clearly screwed up entering the burgers into the POS system. When I told her they were both wrong she said I didn't ask for cheese and then took the burgers back. When they came out again it was clearly the same burgers just modified. The waitress had a real attitude problem when we told her things were wrong, I tried being polite but she barely listened to the problem before walking away. My friend just wanted a plain cheese burger, no fixings and he had lettuce, onion, relish, ketchup and pickles.  I ended up with the wrong cheese and microwave flavor and relish I didn't ask for as well. We asked for the manager and he seemed confused and distracted and was barely helpful. My friend got his new burger which you could tell they rush cooked poorly. I was starving so I suffered through half of my burger even though it was terrible. The manager did comp our food so we only had to pay for the sodas but the worst part was that the waitress never came by to see if the food was right after the last fix,or give any apology. She didn't have to take the blame but giving a general ""sorry about the mix up with your burgers, is everything correct now? Can I get you more fries?"" would have sufficed but she didn't come over and say a word to us and ninja'd over to the table to drop off the bill for the sodas. When you are working in the service industry you don't have to kiss your customer's butt but this was ridiculous. I told the manager she had a real attitude problem and he must have said something cause she was bubbly over at one of her other tables while she continued to ignore us.

Jason P.,"Forest Hills, NY",519,1118,3572,4.0,3/5/2009,"Who would have thought a chain restaurant would make such a delicious burger. Located in a large multi-sectional shopping complex, you'll find a Red Robin. Plenty of parking outside, though it can quite busy fighting for a spot with all the other shoppers. Walking into this Red Robin, I noticed it was unusually big from the other Red Robins. To the right is a large oval-shaped bar area with several TV's to catch the current sports games. Straight ahead, there are about 30-40 tables, varying from booths to normal 4-chaired tables. Just beyond the seating, is the kitchen in the rear which is somewhat blocked/concealed from the diners. Part of the Red Robin experience is watching the chefs go through their business cooking your meal. No big deal though, I come here for the food. For a late lunch meal (~1:30pm) on a Friday, the place was fully occupied with several patrons waiting in the front for a table. For my meal, I ordered the A.1. Peppercorn Burger ($9.49) which is includes hickory-smoked bacon, Pepperjack cheese, A.1. peppercorn spread, crispy onion straws, onions, tomatoes, on an onion bun. Also included is all-you-can-eat steak fries. Our meals came out pretty quick, in about 8-10 minutes. Mmmm, boy did that Peppercorn burger look delicious, and it sure was delicious!! The meat was very flavorful and tender, not dry nor undercooked, yum!. All the ingredients in this burger complemented each other so well, I just couldn't get enough. Service was average to above. Our waiter was somewhat aloof and seemed to be paying attention to everyone and everything except us. That probably goes to explain why he had messed up the Red Robin Gourmet Cheeseburger ($8.99) with Onion Rings (substituted for the steak fries). He quickly apologized and brought a basket of crispy perfectly cooked onion rings with no additional charge. The waiter was somewhat unaccommodating as he never came by once to ask if we needed anything else, but was not a major deal as we were too busy scarfing down our burgers. In all, I've been on my quest for the perfect burger, and I have to admit for a chain restaurant, Red Robin makes some exceptional burgers.

Melanie D.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",22,146,,3.0,8/26/2008,"Ok, my BFF and her DH have lived in town four or so years, and it scares the sh!t outta me how, after at least 15 years as Cambridge hispter-types, they have been so beaten down my suburbia--no, hell, this is exurbia (hey, it's a term I learned in my college geography class, 'k?),--that this passes for a Decent Night Out with Quality Food. Believe me, Dear Reader, I was skeptical. Especially because this is a burger place, the three of us all have pretty serious veggie-tarian bents (two would be bordering on veggie-fascist, I'll let you guess who), and well, this looked like a Johnny Rockets full of screaming seven-year-old birthday parties waiting to happen. Not. My. Scene. But, nooooo, BFF and BFFDH insisted. This place is goooood, they swore. They can turn any of the regular burgers into veggie ones, my friends promised.  We started with the onion ring tower, which reminded me of one of those Fisher-Price ring stacking toys you had when you were a wee infant and were trying to develop your hand-eye coordination and nascent sense of reasoning, but didn't know that's what you were doing because you were still too young to know much of anything. But I digress. The onion-tower ring comes with two dipping sauces, one a dijon-horseradish thing, the other a chipolte mayo, which was by far the better of the two although both were quite good. The tower only has maybe 12 rings, but we couldn't finish them, even among the three of us. Drinks--and french fries--are bottomless, which is either a genius marketing move, or proof that ""Red Robin"" is really an alias for ""Red Satan."" Either way, the amount of fries you get at the onset were pretty paltry--like 1/3 a regular order at another burger joint, so it's a bit of a cheat, actually.  The veggie-cized burger I had was pretty dang tasty, too. Can't remember what it was, but it doesn't matter, because at a chain like this, it all boils down to, as the Greeks said, seven plots, which go something like classic American (cheese, lettuce, tomato), bacon burger, barbeque burger, blue cheese burger, smokehouse burger, teriyaki burger,  blah blah blah. The decor is faux vintage 50s nostalgia, a mix of sports and Rt. 66 gas station/freedom of the American road, which is pretty pathetic because    these places probably populate hundreds of American malls, which definitely do not celebrate the open spaces of my country tis of thee. All the wait staff  look like the types of kids who only up until last summer, were scooping at Coldstone until it got totally uncool to work there so they got real jobs where they don't have to sing to split the tip jar as big as their prom date's tits/prick (choose one). However, the singing still comes in handy, as this place is very popular for birthday parties. Not kiddie parties. There was a 21-year-old having hers. And this was at 3 pm.

Kristen had one of their famous burgers, Kat had a soup and sandwich combo of a turkey club on a croissant with a cup of chowda (she loved the soup), and I had a Southwest fajita salad of sorts. The burger was served with ""bottomless steak fries"" but she never saw any after her plate sat empty. They were never offered, and who wants to ask for more?!? Lame. They should just keep 'em comin'... My salad was very fresh, had just the right amount of chipotle-ranch dressing, and lots of stuff: red and yellow peppers, black beans, corn, and tortilla strips. The ""grilled"" piece of chicken on my salad was nothing more than a reheated, steamed, piece of airplane chicken that you'd find on a sandwich at Panera. It had black grill marks that looked like they were drawn on, had no seasoning, and absolutely no flavor. I literally ate 2, maybe 3 bites, and the server never even asked if it was okay, if something was wrong, nada. Good place for kids, otherwise steer clear. I shouldda stuck to popcorn and sour patch kids during the movie (that I am watching as I type this!!) Lesson learned!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury?start=100
Sean B.,"Milford, MA",0,10,,4.0,10/5/2012,"Been to RR plenty of times and have a good experience maybe 8/10 visits. Food is good, a little expensive, but what isn't these days. Staff is friendly, usually have a nice waitress (only once did we have an older woman who clearly was not happy to be there and screwed up the order to boot). Their milkshakes are hit or miss, depends on when you go I suppose. The only thing that grinds my gears is that they stopped serving those garlic fries that you could have as an option if your meal came with french fries. I loved those! When they first stopped doing it we were told to just ask nicely and they would make it anyways but after a while the waitstaff we had didn't know what we were talking about. Too bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury?start=100

Greta K.,"Worcester, MA",210,400,79,3.0,8/30/2009,"So, I've been to Red Robin several times, to this one once and to a locale in Kentucky a few times.  Today, I had my complimentary birthday burger, which was a great thing.  However, I would not really recommend this particular burger-- the Santa Fe.  I loved the guacamole and the pepper jack cheese, but the burger was not really a medium rare (more like a medium) and the tortilla chips on the sandwich were just stale and odd-tasting, not complimentary at all.  Also, the service was okay.  I've had better burgers and chicken burgers there (one time, I tried to order a chicken sandwich medium rare; I think I had a total brain fart), including the whiskey river burger.  Their fries, onion rings, and peanut butter pie (not sure if they still make this) are still awesome!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury?start=100
Dana R.,"Worcester, MA",80,42,,2.0,9/1/2009,"Gourmet burgers are promised, but not delivered. When you enter Red Robin, you'll instantly be reminded of every other American-style chain in existence, including a surprisingly kid friendly environment. Big check mark in the family-friendly column there, but that should be your first clue that the experience won't brush on gourmet. Service is generally prompt and friendly, even during busy evening hours, but the atmosphere is a big turn off. It's very clean, but noisy and the inviting, dim lights can't hide the garish interior.  The food could make up for everything, but you've been here before, you know what you're getting. Don't fool yourself, this is every other joint abutted to every other strip mall you've ever been to. The ""gourmet"" burgers are modestly sized, pre-shaped patties, cooked roughly to order... I'd be astounded if these things weren't delivered frozen. I said they were cooked roughly to order, and that's in no way aided by the very un-gourmet query of: ""would you like a little pink or no pink?""  The specialty drinks served are syrupy dreck in funny shaped glasses that are only good for kids, provided that they're not prone to hyperactivity. The fries are, again, the same thing you've had everywhere else. In fact, the only thing that saves Red Robin from being every other place are the many interesting toppings for their burgers, including occasional out-there specials. Not high quality, but interesting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury?start=100
Lynette K.,"Medfield, MA",80,692,380,3.0,12/25/2008,"Came here recently. The food was really, really casual and delicious. I got a chicken dish and my bf got a burger. We both  really enjoyed our meals. Mine came with salsa and it was awesome. Most salsa are just ""meh"" whereas this was fresh and extra tasty. I would not go out of my way to get here but if its closeby and you are hungry...don't hesitate to graba good bite!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury?start=100
Ellen L.,"Shrewsbury, MA",34,241,,3.0,4/16/2008,"As a Seattle native, I have to support all things seattle!  And this, my friends is one of the many great things to come out of the pacific northwest!  the burgers are tasty, but best of all is the freckled lemonade.  I get this every time i'm here and it's well worth it.  Basically, it's a lemonade with the syrupy strawberries (free refills).  Also, the red robin flavoring that they put on their fries is great.  I wish i could just buy a little bottle of that because i feel like it would be tasty on more than just the fries.  Also, don't forget that the fries are bottomless and you can eat as many as you want.  it's great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury?start=100
F V.,"Woburn, MA",0,83,,2.0,7/7/2010,"I went here for a good meal but they are cutting corners. The onion rings were reheated, refried maybe? No one at my table could eat them. I should have asked for a refund for the upgrade. uneven color and texture and I guess as a side without the sauce it is not as good as burger king. I had the bacon, avacado, lettuce, tomato on a croissant sandwich. It would have been divine but they use some yucky cheap mayo and they put way too much mayo on every surface of croissant they could smear. The restraunt is an hour away from my home so I was in a hurry and did not want to send it back. My waitress disappeared for cigarette breaks without cheeking that we had immediately sucked our cups dry because it was a 90 degree day. She smelled horribly of cigarettes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury?start=100
Bethany B.,"Boston, MA",311,451,19,3.0,6/10/2008,"Great burgers -- inventive for my lil corner of the state. I'd enjoy them more if I didn't have this nasty habit of checking the nutritional info for items that I want to try -- and I do it for EVERYTHING. My favorite is the Royal Red Robin Burger. It's a good ol' bacon cheeseburger --and then they slap a fried egg on top. I'm from a small town in PA that is known for it's LARGE population, so I think it's in my genes to be able to spot the caloric winners on menus. Husband gets a new burger everytime -- A-1 Peppercorn, RR Bacon Cheeseburger, and the Guacamole Bacon Burger, all tasty. The Towering Onion Rings lived up to their name. Great with a cold Sam at the bar. They do not do cooked to order which is a pet peeve of mine. They will let the burger chefs know if  ""a little pink"" would be appreciated.  The fries are good and when you eat in -- bottomless. The French Onion soup was cheesy and hot.  The place is great to take little ones. Everytime we have managed to get a table there the noise level is high making the sound of screaming children become a kind of ""white noise"".  The drinks from the bar have been a good strong pour. I did have one bartender explain that she dipped the straw into the straight alcohol before serving a mixed drink so that it would seem stronger. Hope she only does this to those who are about to be cut off.  So all in all -- good burgers -- don't look up the NI, and bring ear plugs just incase.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury?start=100
unknown u.,"Boston, MA",24,87,21,2.0,11/26/2010,"So this is the second time i've been to this particular Red Robin. I had gone before about 3 years ago with my brother. Remember it being fine and decent. I went last week with my boyfriend after seeing Harry Potter. It was around 9 pm and we had to wait about 5-10 minutes to be seated (it wasn't busy at all). He had ordered the mint brownie milkshake. I asked for some silverware so I could try some of my boyfriends milkshake. After having waited 10 minutes with no spoon and the milkshake melted, I asked a different server for a spoon, which he got with in 10 seconds. Once our waiter noticed we had a spoon, he immediately grabbed a spoon and acted like ""oh did I give you a spoon already?"" NO, but nice try. Then, they bring us our meals out, the salad with apples and chicken breast (ps. the dijon dressing it comes with is horrible, ask for balsamic on the side instead, much better). As we are finishing our salads, he brings us the garlic bread that our salads come with. Overall, not too great of an experience. Food is ok for a hamburger joint. It is clean inside, not dirty or grimy. They also didn't give us a hard time with my therapy dog. So, thumbs up to that. Happy eating!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury?start=100
David T.,"Gardner, MA",78,87,5,4.0,12/27/2009,"I really like the burgers here.  I generally get the Royal.  Great fries, and they are bottomless.  My only complaint is it is a bit pricey.  My kids love it here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury?start=100
