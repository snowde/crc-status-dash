Barb C.,"South Bend, IN",0,7,,1.0,5/4/2017,"This was perhaps the worst meal I have had to pay for in a very long time. I went to enjoy a burger meal with my daughter and 7 year old granddaughter on Saturday evening. Upon being seated our waitress (who was very busy) asked for our drink order before even opening menu. We had not been there before and with no time to look yet just ordered soft drinks. I looked at children's menu to try and establish what my granddaughter would eat, and again before having any time to look at menu the waitress just stood at table wanting our order. We ordered and before long food arrived. The burgers were extremely greasy and buns were therefore soggy. My burger did not come as ordered. We could not eat them they tasted so bad. The waitress removed one and offered something else to daughter. She ordered a chicken sandwich which took 25 minutes. When it arrived, it was dry and tasteless. She could not eat it either.  The.manager, Theresa, came to table as we paid to leave and find food elsewhere. Because I had already swiped my card, she offered to refund most of bill. Said it would take a couple days. I was suspicious that she asked for no information. Well, almost a week later, there has been no contact, and no refund. This food is highly overpriced, not good, and I will never recommend it to anyone I know. I felt sorry for the waitress. She was trying under difficult circumstances. The poor food was not her fault. And she was too busy to spend any time with her customers. Never going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mishawaka?start=20
M K.,"Orange, CA",1,34,12,2.0,12/29/2015,So I order the Avo-Cobb-o salad and am informed that they have replaced the egg with cucumber but it's the same price.

(Please see photos of the restroom.) The burger was good but the service was so slow and at least half a dozen servers were just sitting in plain view of the customers.  Had to wait for fries despite the fact that they are supposed to be 'bottomless'.   On the up side, BEER! 4 burgers with fries, 1 order of onion rings, 1 beer, 2 small milkskakes = $80 with tip.   REALLY?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mishawaka?start=20

Amy Beth P.,"Berkley, MI",2,8,3,1.0,9/23/2014,"I want to say positive things about Red Robin because it looks fun, the menu is fun, it seems to want to be fun - however: this particular restaurant has been consistently  disappointed because, of all things, the service.  Our server was completely awful and troll-like. Our food was brought out by a food runner, and we had no silverware. So we asked the runner to get us some, which he went to get. Our waitress Courtney popped her head around the corner and said ""is everything ok here?"" and we said - we don't have any silverware, to which she, shockingly, accused my wife of ""making a face"" when replying about waiting for silverware and  looking across the room towards the man getting our cutlery.  The remainder of the meal was unpleasant, we were worried what she would act like if she came back. She was mostly absent as she must have known she made a faux pas. Further interactions she was short, curt and rude. The strangest thing about this place is that the food is good, there is ample staff, and every time we have given it another chance, the staff totally ruins the evening. Sorry Red Robin. We won't return to the Mishawaka location. Maybe another location has staff that have the sense to see their customers as people to actually be NICE to. I recommend going anywhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mishawaka?start=20

Patrick O.,"South Bend, IN",1,10,5,2.0,8/18/2015,"Consistently a mediocre to poor experience.  It's a shame, because I've really enjoyed the other Red Robins that I've been to (especially the one in Valparaiso).  When contrasting the difference between this one and the others, I can only conclude that this one in Mishawaka is just very poorly run and has terrible management. Tonight's experience was typical.  Hostess that seated us was unfriendly.  Table was sticky, and menus were all very sticky and dirty.  Waitress was average.  Fries were cold tonight, and while they're ""bottomless"" this location is always very skimpy with them and make you wait forever for a refill. The sauces, especially the campfire are all very good.  Burgers are the best part, but they made some changes in a few of their recipes and aren't as good as they used to be. I was so excited when this place first opened because we loved eating at the one in Valpo.  Tonight, as usual it was mostly empty.  We only eat here once or twice a year, because out of the dozen or so times we've been here, it's only been terrific once.  I'd be surprised if this location stays open another 5 years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mishawaka?start=20

Brandon H.,"Grand Rapids, MI",8,2,,4.0,1/23/2014,"I am in Mishawaka on business staying in the Residence Inn (literally 1/4 mile away).  I was craving a burger, a snow storm was coming in, and I did not feel like traveling far.   Upon entering the front door I was immediately seated facing a TV (they read my mind, I wanted entertainment while eating by myself).  Being from ""Beer City USA"" (Grand Rapids, MI), I like to try different microbrew beers when I have the chance.  To my surprise, RedRobin had a couple Indiana Microbrews.  I ordered Three Floyds Brewing's ""Pride & Joy"" which was very good.  Unfortunately, they were out of the other microbrew.  I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ burger medium rare.  I was happy I was even given the option of how I wanted it cooked as it seems many chains default to well done/medium well.  The burger arrived quickly and exactly how I ordered it.  The burger was very flavorful and the crispy onion straws were as described, crispy!   The steak fries were disappointing as they were soggy and seemed as if they had been reheated by the microwave.  I ate them anyway and got a second batch since they are ""unlimited.""  The second batch was about the same.

The last two times I've been there, my burger and sweet potato fries were so salty as to be almost inedible. The BBQ chicken burger would have been so good without the overly greasy, insanely salty onion straws. I let the manager know tonight, and he offered to remake my sandwich but I refused. I couldn't wait another 30 minutes with a toddler on the verge of a meltdown. The restaurant was nearly empty on a Monday night, but it took so long to get our food. Just disappointing. I thought this was one of the better chain/family restaurants in the Grape Road area, but maybe I was wrong.  They will get one, maybe two more chances. My husband seems to like everything he gets.

Rob W.,"Indianapolis, IN",4,66,,1.0,11/6/2011,"So it has been a little over a year since our last adventure to Red Robin, and boy I have to say things have gotten much worse.  The only highlight of our trip was that the manager at least took the time to apologize and offer to fix the problem by discounting the ticket, that is an improvement from the last time.  The main issues this trip were with the food; the waitress wasn't near as bad as last time, but not anywhere near the best I have ever had wait on a table.  They couldn't cook our burgers to the right temps, the bacon was not even close to cooked, and the food was cold when it got to our table; so cold my son wouldn't eat his corn dog, that kid loves corn dogs.  How can a place that ""prides"" itself on gourmet burgers cooked to your liking not get the temps on a burger right. I really hope this is the next place to shutter it's doors in Mishawaka.  I feel bad for anyone who loses their job, but this place is just not going in the right direction, next time I will have to stick to my gut and not give a place a second try if I didn't want to give them a second try a year ago.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mishawaka?start=20

I was pleasantly surprised with my most recent visit. I got the A1 burger and it was good! And the carry out containers are superb. Sturdy and kept the food warm for a length of time!

It's like the bread is old. You will end up having to clean your hands when you are done.  The freckled fruit is nice that is endless and had very good taste to it.

Angelo U.,"South Bend, IN",2,16,29,4.0,6/21/2017,"I have been there several times before and I have yet to have a bad experience. On the weekends in the late afternoon ot can be quite busy as it's their peak hours. I opted to sit at the bar which has a price menu listing the different beers and sizes. The beer is a bit pricey.  The menus are well laid out and give a good discription of the sandwiches. Don't like burgers, but the person with you does? Don't worry they got you covered. There are plenty of non burger items. They also have the best poutine this side of the border.  The service was good for it being busy as I didn't have to wait long for my beer to be refilled. The server was polite.

Christopher K.,"Loma Linda, CA",99,65,56,2.0,1/29/2015,"After coming to this Red Robin over 20 times, the only thing I've really been impressed by this restaurant has been their consistency. Consistently dirty. Consistently bad service. Consistently decent to okay burgers. It's really quite impressive in that aspect. Cleanliness: Almost every time I sit down, I usually find the table quite sticky and thus uncomfortable to rest my elbows on top. The menus, although well designed, are filled with oily residue from previous hands and I'll find the occasional food-part stuck on a page. A very dirty experience overall. Burgers: The one saving grace this place has to offer are their burgers. This is a Red Robin so their burgers are far from what I'd consider exceptional, BUT they aren't bad either! I really enjoy their Prime Chophouse and Bleu Ribbon burgers. My only complaint is that their burgers are usually cooked all the way through even if I ask for otherwise. Another plus is that they do offer vegetarian options for all of their burgers, allowing you to replace the burger with a boca or black bean (I forget which--maybe even both!). Bottomless Fries: It's hilarious to be how they offer bottomless fries but they almost always skimp out on the portions when they serve you. Not only that, but they take forever to bring them out. I find it most effective to ask for fries immediately after ordering our burgers--a simple ""can we start out with fries"" usually does the trick. The fries are pretty good and the sauces are excellent. Campfire is definitely the best sauce there--a mix of ketchup and buffalo sauce it seems. Service: 4/5 times the service will be forgettable to terrible. I can't remember the last time that I had an excellent service experience at this location. Rude, unapologetic, indifferent. I could go on, but what can you expect? It's a Red Robin. Red Robin Royalty Card: Because I come here so often, I eventually got myself a Red Robin Royalty card. For not paying a cent, it's definitely worth it. I've gotten plenty of free birthday burgers as well as a free burger for every 10th time I get one. A nice perk if you find yourself here a lot. Overall: Why do I go here so often? As a college student, this is probably one of the best places to go as a large group for birthdays, celebrations, etc. They can accommodate for 15+ people pretty easily and the food's good enough that it's still worth it to go. Solid for a casual lunch or dinner, just don't expect too much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mishawaka

Alexandra S.,"Mishawaka, IN",0,3,,1.0,11/5/2016,"DON'T BRING YOUR COUPONS! We do not frequent Red Robin normally. No particular reason. We got an AMAZING coupon in the mail and decided to use it as the only Red Robin restaurant was only about a half mile from our home. It was 50% off a RR finest burger (excluding RR gourmet) so I was pretty happy and in the mood for a burger. We ordered our food and specified ""medium"" when asked how we wanted them cooked. We waited for about 30 mins and our 2 burgers came out. They were extremely well done, over salted, and dry. For some reason (maybe it is default) my burger came plain. When I asked our waitress for some lettuce and mayo she looked at me like I was literally insane. I added to my request, ""is that ok?"" because she made me feel so uncomfortable. I hate when staff at a place I am at makes me feel weird. At the end of the meal I presented the coupon we received, enticing us to eat there in the first place. She took our coupon and came back with a manager. ""These are mostly for chain locations"" she (the manager) says. ""we can't accept this"" ....I'm thinking ""Am I not standing in a Red Robin right now?"" I informed the manager that I had come to their establishment SOLEY because of the coupon and since they are the only location, chain or not, in our area it seemed shady to send coupons out like that. I had the coupon, we ordered 2 burgers, her standing behind the advertisement would have been very appreciated. (I was not ugly with them nor did I raise my voice) She could have easily apologized for the misunderstanding and comped %50 of one of our burgers, kept our business AND gotten a positive management review despite the poor service and overcooked order. However, that did not happen. They both just stood there like I was not speaking English. It was very frustrating. I ended up paying $25 for bad burgers and an extremely frustrating experience. There was one waitress that was very busy, yet friendly and accommodating (even though we weren't her table) she was doing a great job. If you are going to go to RR anyway, ask for Michelle.

Dan D.,"Chicago, IL",6,8,,1.0,11/9/2013,"Terrible. I've been to red robin at other locations at it was good, but this location is horrible. Bad slow service and really cold in restaurant.  Cold burgers that literally made me throw up when I got home. Fries are ok. Beer is cold but they were so slow only had one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mishawaka?start=40
Heather H.,"Glendale, CA",256,139,263,4.0,1/2/2012,"Brusetta chicken sandwhich! Hands down, super yummy. Worth it. They have bottomless frenchfries, which is how I like it. Who gets a little bit of fries and says ""that's enough""? Silly people, that's who. My favorite part of their bottomless fries is that no one knows how many refills ya got. ;o) they all look the same. There seasoning shaker right there on the table is delish as well. Good times for reuniting with friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mishawaka?start=40
Randall H.,"Edwardsburg, MI",0,2,,3.0,3/9/2014,Got here at 8:30 was immediately seated.  And after that it all went down hill fast.  I ordered fries and clucks and my husband and son had wiseguy burgers.  We also ordered freckled lemonades and only got one refill as the waiter never brought me a new one..  you know.. I normally tip.. but this man took our glasses said he would be back with our refill.. and nothing.  He is not busy.  Only us and one other table.  Had to stop him to ask for more fries too.  And still no drinks .... well he just came to give us our check.  Said that his co waitress left early due to a nervous breakdown... he apologized dor long wait but still didnt bring my sons refill. I did finally get mine however.  My score of 3 is due to lack of service and cold fries that we wound up eating anyway due to being hungry and no waiter. ...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mishawaka?start=40
Dave C.,"Rochester, IN",5,11,,1.0,11/16/2013,First let me say my family and I love Red Robin but this location is horrible.  We have been there twice and both times the service has been very very bad.  We stopped for dinner at 4:30 before the rush and they were not busy.  We were seated and it took 15 minutes before Dan our server even came over to greet us.  He asked us for our drinks and because we had been there for 15 minutes we stated we would like to order now.  He told us I am not taking your order now I will take it when I have a free moment.  Again no one was there.  So we stated we would really like to order he stated I will be back to take your order.  He was extremely rude.  We asked to speak to a manager and after 10 minutes of not seeing a manager we decided to leave.  I would give 0 stars for this location and 5 stars for all other Red Robin locations.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mishawaka?start=40
Kenya R.,"Mishawaka, IN",13,5,,2.0,4/27/2010,"Good food, mediocre service. I've eaten here three times in the last few months and the servers have consistently ignored our table of two in favor of larger parties. I know we're not as much work, but please don't completely ignore us! During the entire course of our meal, we did not receive silverware. I don't think we'll be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mishawaka?start=40
Bella D.,"Portland, OR",0,199,,3.0,12/8/2012,"My husband loves this place so much that he has become their brand ambassador. So after some relentless pestering I let him take me there again this weekend. I ordered the grilled turkey sandwich which was ""meh"". My husband, on the other hand, ordered his usual Burning love burger with crispy chicken patty and relished it. c",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mishawaka?start=40
Nicholas R.,"Elkhart, IN",14,44,2,4.0,4/3/2011,"I've been to Red Robin on a couple different occasions and have had great food every time. I especially like the burger with the fried egg on it. And an endless basket of fries is a nice touch. Slightly pricey compared to the other ""burger-chain"" spots in the area but worth it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mishawaka?start=40
