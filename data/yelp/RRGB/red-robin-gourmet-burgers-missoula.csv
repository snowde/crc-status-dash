Babs S.,"Kansas City, MO",7,135,67,4.0,11/9/2017,"My son, husband, and two small granddaughters hit this place on a very busy Saturday night. An unexpected party of 24 kids dressed like they were probably going to homecoming afterwards descended upon the place just as we got there so I figured the wait would be LOOOONG. The manager was called in to deal with the large party and, while she seemed a bit worried at first, managed to round up enough tables for everyone. Our waitress was Brittany and she did an excellent job taking care of the needs of the two toddlers in our party. My 'shroom burger was tasty and those fries are pretty hard to beat. Oh, and even with the large party, we were served in a timely manner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula
Gris G.,"Missoula, MT",1,39,8,1.0,12/17/2017,Sat alone at a bar table in the middle of a packed bar and watched the entire 4th quarter of the Saints Jets game and no waitress or bartender ever asked if I wanted a beer. So I just took up a table without spending a dime.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula
Barbara M.,"Missoula, MT",0,19,3,1.0,11/12/2017,The women's bathroom was non functional as neither 2 of the toilets would flush and only one of the two sinks would operate. Makes one wonder how the kitchen works.  Told manager and got a 'why bother me look'. Sorry I'm never going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula
Carl H.,"River Road, Missoula, MT",3,17,2,1.0,12/5/2017,Service was slow on a Tuesday night. That led to poor service and cold food. We will not go back. All our waiter could say was he was sorry over and over. Dirty dishes stacked up in the bar area near our table that was disgusting.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula
Nicole W.,"Kalispell, MT",0,3,3,1.0,10/28/2017,I usually love Red Robin and always look forward to going when I'm missoula. Today was a joke. Desiree and Sarah are both terrible hosts. Both are rude and have no concept of customer service. We didn't even make it past the host station. We won't be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula
Mandie H.,"Whitefish, MT",132,347,237,4.0,12/8/2016,"Red Robin is certainly not the most stylin' nor original place to eat. But I have fond memories of it when I was a child and they have managed to keep that nostalgia. I also can't deny any place that has their own season salt at the table. Can just lick that stuff right from my hand. That said, we came here for some apps and drinks mid-day and we really enjoyed it.  Wedge Salad (only $3) has crispy flash-fried onion strings on it, Clam Chowder is legit, Poutine has an amazing mushroom stout gravy on it. Nachos were decent. I love soupy nacho cheese, and they use real cheese here. Ugh. BUT, and I mean, a big BUT, they pickle their own jalapenos here and they are amazing!! Anything with these babies on them is going to be good. Fresh Pickled Jalapenos.  Other items we specifically come here for: Nantucket Seafood Scatter, Clucks and Fries (Buffalo-style), Tortilla Soup, Bottomless Fries, Towering Onion Rings.  Great for mid-day and late night snacks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula
Rachelle R.,"Palm Desert, CA",66,1,,1.0,8/21/2017,"Seriously the worst Red Robin I have ever been to. Took forever to get service. When our food finally came it was cold, the bacon was practically raw and the fries were cold and old. Never saw our server (Greg) until the end and he didn't care at all about our cold food. He also didn't give us back our credit card after we paid and had to wait forever to get it back. Still didn't apologize.  Definitely not impressed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula
Kami R.,"Puyallup, WA",1,16,,1.0,1/21/2017,The worst service ever and the food was cold. The server only came to the table twice once to take our order and then when she over heard me saying how shitty the service was. She didn't even offer waters!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula
Natari S.,"Coeur d'Alene, ID",7,31,107,4.0,5/2/2016,This is like gotta be one of the best locations of this food chain that i really liked the most. The staff was awesome! Lots of thumbs up! Love the fact that even though it was busy  got seats really fast. food was good and it came out nice and quick as well.  I love Missoula as well! So much to do.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula
Patrick D.,"Nine Mile Falls, WA",0,3,,5.0,6/24/2017,Great service and very friendly! Accommodated our GF needs very well!!! I also forgot my wallet and live 3 hours away. They mailed it back to me at no cost. Great place and highly recommended!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula
Christine G.,"Travis Air Force Base, Travis Air Force Base, CA",0,13,,1.0,4/23/2017,"If you want a true Red Robin experience DO NOT come here! The service was incredibly slow and the staff were pretty rude. On top of that they had the house music turned up so loud one could mistake it for a nightclub. Except on a Sunday afternoon, in what is supposed to be a family friendly restaurant. Will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula
Anony M.,"Missoula, MT",0,26,3,2.0,8/21/2016,The food always gives me heartburn. No matter what I try. The soda was flat so I just got a water which was murky. It is very cold there. Bring a sweater. Nice looking building though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula
Jason L.,"Helena, MT",20,189,41,4.0,4/27/2016,"I really really wish I can give this place 5 stars but much to my dismay, they don't offer the monster burger anymore. I would have given them 3 stars just for that but since I got a bottomless root beer float they earned a star back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula
Randy P.,"Missoula, MT",438,204,1086,4.0,12/26/2014,"Had lunch today, sat at the bar, bartender was very friendly and quick with service. He knew the beers on tap and made suggestions.  Beer was cold and flavorful, order taken and did not have to wait long for food to arrive.  Food was hot and tasty, had the fish & chips, cooked perfectly. The fry sauce was the bomb!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula
Jennifer T.,"Billings, MT",225,263,397,4.0,3/29/2015,Came here last night with a party of 8. Made reservations and were promptly seated upstairs. We had the best server and the yummiest meal. We were all extremely pleased with our burgers  (3 of which were the whiskey bbq burger SO YOU KNOW IT'S GOTTA BE GOOD) Can't say enough good things about our experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula
Kody B.,"Missoula, MT",117,21,3,4.0,2/18/2016,"I eat here regularly. Roughly every other week. It's a go-to place to eat on Sundays after church or whenever family is in town. They even make food to go, so you can order your favorite dish, pick it up, and enjoy it at home. They have recently remodeled and there is now a dedicated area for families and an area for everyone 21+. This has been an amazing improvement. The waiters and waitresses are extremely nice and helpful, management is also top notch. I have been to numerous Red Robins nationwide and this place is a notch above the rest. In terms of food you cannot go wrong. I typically go the Burger route tho, I mean it's Red Robin, save the salad and steak for your anniversary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula
Jerry K.,"Columbus, MT",6,58,18,3.0,2/26/2015,"Red Robin is going downhill with thier serving sizes and the meat patties are getting really thin! Only reason they received 3 stars was because our server Matt was the greatest I have had in a long long time, I sing his praises!!!! Matt stayed on top of everything and never had to ask for refills! If Red Robin keeps getting cheap on servings they will lose my service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula
Jason T.,"Missoula, MT",29,16,26,2.0,8/1/2015,"Used to be better before the ""rule change"" had a large table with hungry children after the hour wait to get in. When we asked for fries ahead of time (as we have many times before) they stayed it was against the rules. Then they proceeded to bring food out in such sparse order that much of the table was done before the rest had gotten food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula
Stephen P.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",1,13,4,3.0,8/10/2014,Good food always. Been to this location several times. Nice variety of burgers and drink choices.  Service is usually pretty slow. Wait 3-5 min for a greet. Don't expect refills often.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula
Krista D.,"Missoula, MT",87,5,,2.0,10/20/2015,"So I usually like Red Robins..but this time, I was disappointed. my boyfriend and I went there for a dinner date. He got a hamburger topped with mushroom that looks like a left over and they served him cold fries. And I ordered soup that was microwave and wasn't all the way hot and my salad looks like it's been sitting in their refrigerator for a week. And the service was okay. She didn't really smile at all makes me sad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula
Ari M.,"Missoula, MT",269,205,51,3.0,1/21/2015,"This place was packed on a cold afternoon in January, but that didn't slow down the experience one bit. Their kitchen knows what to do with a crowd, and my order was delivered in a very reasonable amount of time, all things considered. I suppose if I could judge this experience entirely on the food itself and the service, I would give Red Robin another star. After all, the burger tasted great, the fries were delicious, and the service was on point. Unfortunately, it wasn't long after digging into my burger that my stomach started hurting, and I can't say that's the first time I've experienced that after eating here. Who knows; maybe it's a coincidence. As a chain, I've always enjoyed Red Robin. But if it happens again, I'll have to update this review and take away another star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula?start=20
Ed A.,"Clancy, MT",0,11,2,5.0,7/31/2015,"Had a great meal today!!!  We had the ""Fish and chips "". With one of the best milkshakes I have had in a long time. The service was just right. We don't usually go to RR, but we will be re-thinking that move. Thanks for a good time and a good meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula?start=20
Meghan B.,"Pocatello, ID",8,11,,2.0,5/28/2015,Had lunch today with my dad and daughter. Waitress seemed annoyed of my daughter being slightly loud. It's also very annoying that they charge for fries now. Red robin is known for bottomless fries. Will no longer be my first choice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula?start=20
Lindsey S.,"Missoula, MT",0,13,,3.0,5/11/2016,"Food was good as usual but it's not a clean place! I felt like o was eating in the middle of a kids playland instead of a restaurant. Food all over the floor, menus greasy, just an all around dirty look and feel. I'd love to frequent more often if they would focus more on cleanliness but I figure if the dining area looks like that the kitchen probably isn't any better, yikes!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula?start=20
Sarah M.,"Missoula, MT",17,17,,3.0,2/2/2015,"As a whole, I like Red Robin, but this location seems to be stuck in a funk.  I mostly eat take out, and the food qualify and portions are always inconsistent.  One day you'll get a small handful of fries with your burger, and another you'll get a Hulk sized portion that hardly fits in the box (no complaints about the latter, of course!).  They once charged my card twice for my order, and it took several days to get a refund on my card.  The hostesses are not warm and inviting and make you feel like you're burdening them with your presence.  Out of five or so times diving in, I've had two good waitresses.  Out of ten or so times calling in an order, I've had maybe three people be friendly and polite over the phone.  I almost feel like if the staff changed completely, the restaurant would take a drastic turn for the best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula?start=20
Meg G.,"Missoula, MT",20,41,,4.0,5/21/2015,"The service here is decent, if it's not busy you'll be sat quickly just like any other restaurant. Their food is always hot and portioned great. The work ethic is different at this Red Robin than any others I've been to, others have not been so great but this Red Robin is redeeming my wallet and affections.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula?start=20
Jennifer H.,"Helena, MT",177,87,332,4.0,10/12/2014,Great food as always. My water tasted slightly like root beer and this location is ALWAYS freezing cold no matter where you sit. Worth it for the burger though!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula?start=20
Matt C.,"Missoula, MT",65,16,,3.0,5/21/2015,"The chicken avocado wrap was good, but the fries were a bit limp. Also, the server seemed rather inattentive at times, like we'd need to wave her down for the smallest things. Also, the booths are too squished together--which caused issues for me getting in and out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula?start=20
Bree I.,"Missoula, MT",1,43,1,4.0,10/21/2014,"I definitely enjoy eating at this restaurant and obviously come for the burgers and fries. Love their milkshakes but feel that their customer service can use a little bit of help. I have tried calling in to go orders several times and it is more often wrong than right. Which means an extra 10 minutes needs to be calculated in to have them correct it when i pick up my food. Otherwise if you are eating in, its usually decent service, but again not great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula?start=20
Jesse S.,"Missoula, MT",2,9,1,2.0,9/10/2014,"I went for dinner with a friend. I told the server the J&C was not strong and she offered a double, so I ordered it. I was charged for the single and they would not take it off the check . $5.99. I spoke to the floor manager who claimed the back manager would not waive it. I asked to speak to the back manager who never showed up. They argued and disrespected, me - a veteran. I paid and left $1 tip. Not going back to this place. What a joke, no interest in the customer I guess. Better service at Jakers and Applebees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula?start=20
Nathan S.,"Missoula, MT",243,11,2,5.0,10/30/2012,"A pink balloon for my kiddo, prompt and friendly service and the food came made to order and quickly.

Nico A.,"Manila, Philippines",209,223,225,4.0,10/16/2011,If you like chain burger joints then this place is for you! It is super family friendly so it can get busy on weekend nights. There is a full bar in there so adults are happy. I really like their burgers! The Whiskey River one with onion rings in it is the bomb. The bottomless steak fries that come with every burger is both a gift and a curse on your body! You have been warned. Haha.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-missoula?start=20
