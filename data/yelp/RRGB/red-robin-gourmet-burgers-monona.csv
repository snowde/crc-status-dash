Sarah R.,"Monroe, WI",40,77,26,5.0,9/2/2017,"Absolutely love the new 'pay and skedaddle' option with the ziosk bill/tipper/credit card scanner. Super user friendly and so much better than waiting for a paper bill. Our server was extremely friendly, courteous, and attentive. Their mixed drinks are always great. Had the pina colada today and downed it..yummmm. I had the bacon cheeseburger but in a lettuce wrap and subbed broccoli for the fries. My burger was cooked perfectly, juicy and flavorful. Only complaint was the less-than-stellar bacon. Better off without bacon. Husband said the same about his pig out burger. Burger itself was perfect but not the bacon. The sweet potato fries he ordered tasted like they'd been double fried In old oil. No good. My broccoli was much better. So hit and miss but had to give 5*s because the burger patties were just so darn good and service was amazing",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monona
Jacob J.,"Madison, WI",9,5,,2.0,1/9/2018,"This was a hard review to write. Red Robin was a strange experience from the point I walked in the door to the point I walked out of it. Objectively speaking this is neither bad nor good. But what pushed me to the edge was not the food or the customer experience, but the value of what you're paying for. The food was good and the waitress I had was very pleasant, but the strange part was the portions and pricing comparison. The food you get and the price you pay don't add up whatsoever. A burger and fries alone could be $15.99 like what mine was. If they were going to rob me I'd prefer they do it at gun point. The burger I received was VERY small and the only thing that remotely satisfied me in the end was the endless fries. But I can speak for a lot of people when I say most people don't go to Red Robin for fries. Overall, pleasant experience just not worth the value. Slapping the word ""gourmet"" on it doesn't justify paying that price. If it doesn't bother you, then by all means eat there. But overall, I don't recommend Red Robin to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monona
Samantha T.,"Middleton, WI",61,56,39,2.0,10/9/2017,I went to RR for the first time in almost 10 years this past weekend and wasn't impressed at all. The staff / manager were friendly and attentive. The food was mediocre. There's nothing that really stood out to make me want to return again. The salsa/guacamole/chips appetizer was $7 and was a ridiculously tiny serving for a small group. My grilled chicken sandwich was drier than the Sahara desert. It'll probably be another 10 years before I go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monona
Shelby N.,"Fort Wayne, IN",187,145,557,3.0,12/6/2016,"Stopped in for lunch while on a business trip in the Monona area.

Cole B.,"Monona, WI",101,1,,1.0,1/8/2018,"If I could do a negative review for here I would. Last two times I've been to this place, both nearly a year apart, was absolutely terrible service. This time I Got seated at 6:35, didn't see our waiter till waiter until around 650, after we had to ask someone why we hadn't even had our drink order taken yet. When he finally got here, we placed our drink and food knowing that we were probably in for a long night of waiting. Turned out to be right. Another 15 minutes and asking another waiter where our drinks were and getting a ""I'm not your waiter"" and walking off response from another employee our drinks finally showed up. Fast forward another 25 minutes, our food finally arrives, not hot, definitely felt like it had been siting awhile. Oh. And all of this is a Monday night when the building is well under half full. This use to be our favorite place to take the kids for birthdays. Boy has it become a frustration factory. Don't go here.

Danielle B.,"McFarland, WI",8,27,6,2.0,1/20/2017,"I've wanted to go to a Red Robin for as long as I can remember because the idea of a diner with burgers and shakes was very appealing. I've been here twice now but I was not impressed either time. The food is not gourmet, I don't care what they tell you on the website and in the commercials. It's just not. I could get the same thing at a mom and pop restaurant down the street. I really don't like how crowded, noisy, and uncomfortable this place is every time I've gone. It was literally so loud the second time I went with my boyfriend that we couldn't even talk, hear each other, or enjoy our date. It was a complete waste of money and for two days I regretted going there and spending my hard-earned cash on their overpriced food. Furthermore, I understand that there's a full bar here and everything but the waiters should not be drinking. One of the waiters, who wasn't even mine, came over to my table and started talking in slurred language. To make it worse, she expected me to reply to her despite the fact that I had a huge bite of burger in my mouth. Why do waiters always come over the second after you've taken a huge bite of food? I will never waste my money here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monona
Zach G.,"Madison, WI",3,3,,1.0,10/20/2017,"Food was good and was served in a reasonable amount of time. Staff was mostly attentive and pricing reasonable. Only one real problem but enough to very much upset my wife and I to the point of not coming back. Managerial figure Brandon was off-putting when spoken to, made my wife very comfortable and was somewhat rude to us when asking pretty simple questions about the menu. My wife insisted that he was acting flirtatious and creepy towards her on her way to the bathroom which is incredibly inappropriate and disgusting behavior and if she had told me immediately I would have absolutely reacted pretty aggressively. I don't want to blame the food, waitstaff, chefs, etc for our very negative experience but we will not be coming back as long as my wife feels so uncomfortable with the kind of leadership present in this restaurant. It would be bad enough to have any given staff member treat a young woman this way but for management to be acting so foul and inappropriate is beyond unacceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monona
Khiang S.,"Madison, WI",73,130,285,2.0,12/2/2015,"A decent place for gourmet burgers. I had the DBG burger with french onion soup and that was just the right amount for lunch. Came during lunch on a Tuesday and was seated immediately. Unfortunately I was seated at the corner and server did not know I was there for a long while. They have a new table side system that you can call for the server, and I pressed the button - still no server. I think the server calling system simply changes the light on top of the unit to red so if no one saw it, no one knows you are there. I was about to leave when the server came over and apologizes with a ""you sneaked passed me Â ..."" joke. No - I was seated by another staff - did not snuck in. Anyway, the rating is for the food. Ordered the DGB burger with french onion soup and it was good. Juicy inside and sauce is tasty. The French onion soup is OK. onions, beef broth, bread and cheese baked in an oven. Oh - i did not know when he said fries or soup, choosing soup adds an extra cost to the bill. The table side system also allows you to check out quickly with a credit card. While I like the efficiency of these systems, I find that it takes away the service part of a restaurant. I can order and pay right from there - so maybe I don't have to tip that much since all the servers do is to give me water and bring out my food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monona
Hannah L.,"Stoughton, WI",0,2,1,1.0,5/16/2017,"We went to this location for dinner tonight, we had food and we're treated well by the servers. I left a good review on our receipt for the woman who helped us. Upon leaving the dining room and next to the bar I slipped and fell to the ground hurting my hand and knee. The floor was obviously wet, but there was no wet floor sign to be seen. Never did an employee ask if I was okay or even acknowledge that I fell. When I got up I made eye contact with the man with a mustache who was in charge of the bar. He did not attempt to ask if I was okay. That experience has left me not wanting to visit this location. The food we had was great and the service when eating was good. But if the staff is so oblivious to their surroundings I don't want to go back to this location. I hope management sees this review and invests in a wet floor sign!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monona
Chy R.,"Madison, WI",957,474,1492,3.0,4/19/2016,"It's a chain, but it's one of those chains that has a good loyalty rewards program so we come here probably a handful of times a year. You get a free burger with the purchase of 10 burgers (doesn't have to be simultaneous) and a free burger on your birthday. A single burger here will run you over 1,000 calories. That's because they sear the bun in margarine and most burgers will come with mayo. I usually get the Bonzai burger without margarine, mayo and cheese and the damage is usually limited to around 670 calories. The burgers are fire grilled and I suppose you can taste some kind of char, but the patties are otherwise unremarkable.  They are known for their bottomless steak fries, but also certain bottomless substitutions, such as a side salad, coleslaw and broccoli. They offer sweet potato fries now too, which are also bottomless at an upcharge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monona

A double burger and bottomless fries for $7. It turns out that the flavor is akin to Hardee's or Burger King on a good day. Â Yes I was belching that godawful charcoal or whatever it is essence the rest of the day. The atmosphere is ok but the burgers are leagues below Five Guys, MooYah or Culvers.

Decent burger at a ok price.  I have no interest in the so called gourmet burgers with a bunch of saucy stuff on them. I would be interested in a grass fed burger; although I'd be skeptical it was actually true if they had one.  Others at the table got a salad thing, and the chicken caesar wrap. Both looked ok and where what you would expect from a chain, pull the chicken out of the bag and microwave. Or do you microwave in the bag and then open?  There was some screen thingy on the table. Â The kind of cool options were a 'call the waiter' button and the option to pay via the thing. Â But be aware if you pay with the screen your probably not getting a receipt. It has the option to print one but the thing is small and clearly does not hold much paper. Ours was out of paper.  You can pay two dollars to play tap games on the screen thing. Meh.

Elizabeth S.,"Madison, WI",0,7,,2.0,3/2/2017,I used to frequent this location often but after the last few times I have decided I will no longer be doing so. The food is generally consistent but the service is truly lacking. I see the same bartenders often and the initial interaction is always mediocre at best. As soon as I pay my bill any acknowledgement of me being there disappears. I never receive a thank you for coming in and I certainly feel like me being there is a nuisance.

Beth L.,"Drumod, Republic of Ireland",156,19,6,5.0,10/8/2015,"We happened to be in Monona and we were looking for a place to eat. Â We normally grab lunch or dinner at the Noodles & Co. there, but I didn't want to for a few reasons (I wanted more food for my buck and I wanted to sit with ""normal"" people in a COMFORTABLE atmosphere), so we decided to try Red Robin. Â None of us had ever been there. Â It was me, my boyfriend and our 8-year-old daughter. Â  Boy were we surprised! Â Not only is it a very family-friendly atmosphere, but it's just a fun place in general (no matter your age). Â We enjoyed the tablet at our table (could be used to order drinks, appetizers or desserts, as well as to pay your bill, join their rewards club and to play games), even though we were charged a $2 entertainment fee, because our daughter played games (still, it was great to be able to sit there and talk as adults and enjoy our meal while she was entertained). Â  Our food was excellent. Â I normally don't like ""pub fries"", which is what I think of when I see the fries they offer, so I was unsure about the bottomless fries, but I ordered a burger (the Black & Bleu) and I upgraded my bottomless fries for 99 cents to the Garlic Parmesan Fries and got the garlic dipping sauce for the fries. Â They were amazing and I did get a second helping of them (second batch was double the size of the first). Â I ate every last bit of my meal. Â It was excellent.

Kyara M.,"Austin, TX",53,143,151,3.0,6/4/2014,"Red Robin is a good place if you want a hamburger that's a step above your typical fast food drive up joint. They are similar to Culvers but doesn't offer you that ""home quality"" kind of experience.  I typically get the Bleu Ribbon with some pink. I like the fried onion straws they add to the burger as well as this chipotle spread they use after toasting their buns. Mix that with the burger, BBQ sauce and bleu cheese and you've got a great tasting large juicy burger. I sometimes have to cut it in half because it's hard to take a bite out of. The burger comes with a side of endless steak fries they are often cooked to perfection. They are one of the few places that offers onion rings, however, as much as I love me some rings, I do not care much for theirs. The onions they use are extremely thick making it hard to bit into. I have often times ended up just eating the breading and putting the onions to the side. They are onion rings! This doesn't make any sense! They need to slice their onions thinner. As of now, I do not believe they are editable.  My other negative is presentation. The Bleu Ribbon has a lot going on so I realized that sometimes the burger can get messy. However, there have been times where my burger has come out looking like it went through a tornado. Lettuce falling everyone, too much BBW sauce, bleu cheese thrown on. The presentation needs to get better. I've experienced this at two different Red Robins. Also, I've also noticed that within the last year, they've cut back on the amount of steak fries they give you. Since they are bottomless it makes really no difference but I've definitely seen a change.  That being said, I would rate Red Robbi as being more than just an ""A-OK"" burger joint but they are far from a ""4+ star"" quality kind of joint. I do like the atmosphere. They have a few game machines, TV's, bar, background music and great classic pictures hanging on the walls that are great for helping to start a conversation ( say you're on a first date?). The art and photography they use to decorate the place I believe adds a lot of character and ""spunk"".  They do get very busy on weekends so expect a wait for a table and for your food but from my experience, it has never been extremely long. Wait staff has been good for me as well.  Overall, they are a solid burger place. A bit pricey but I do think they are good.  Oh, one more thing, if you're dieting,....The Bleu Ribbon is 1,001 calories and fries are close to 500 calories!!! (According to my ""Lose it!"" app - they could be wrong but I also believe this is an extremely high calorie meal)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monona?start=20

Matthew R.,"Madison, WI",4,2,,1.0,6/29/2014,"If I could have given today's experience negative stars, I would have. The food was average. Nothing beyond what you can get anywhere else in this city. What takes places like this to another level is the service and the ambiance. This is what took Red Robin straight into the toilet. From the moment we walked in, this place felt different. I've been here off and on for years, but there was a weird vibe in the air. I knew it was going to be a memorable visit after the hostess asked if we were ""going to need a high chair for that?"" while gesturing at our 9 month old daughter. We were seated fairly quickly, which was nice, and our server seemed average, didn't tell us about anything new, didn't ask us if it was our first time at Red Robin (usually they do, and it wasn't, but still, try a little), and didn't bring us any silverware or napkins. Took our drink order, took our order, and left. She knew we had a baby with us, and knew that she had just taken an order from the table of 8 behind us, and didn't bother to consider bringing the fruit cup for our daughter or my wife and I a basket of fries ahead of time since we'd be waiting a bit due to the large ticket in queue ahead of us. She didn't even bother checking on our drink situations in the meantime. Just went all ghost and ignored us. In this meantime, my wife and I are entertaining our daughter and looking and watching around us. She notices the manager checking in with other tables and rolling her eyes a bit after a few exchanges with customers. I notice a few scoffs and eye-rolls among the staff, and start to get bothered by how the staff is acting like this job is beneath them. Another server brings us our food. I had asked for a side of sauce that doesn't show up, but she gets it promptly. I had asked for no tomato on the burger, but was talked over so she must not have heard it. No big deal. We go to serve some fruit to our daughter, but we still don't have any silverware or napkins, so we ask and some are brought reasonably promptly. And set right in front of our 9 month old daughter. Not the brightest of plans to set metal forks and knives in front of any small child, but especially one who is currently fussing a bit at not having any food. At no point does the manager come by to check on us. Our server barely says another word to us after handing us the bill. They coasted this entire time, why did I expect them to suddenly make any effort? Because I thought they would want us to come back. I'm of the belief that if you think your job is beneath you, then you should prove it. You never know who is watching or who you're serving, and who may be able to help you get out of the job that you don't really like. I mean, there are so many places to get a mediocre burger, you may as well offer above and beyond service to make it stand out. I guess when even the manager is rolling her eyes at customers, the rest of the staff begins to believe that kind of behavior is acceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monona?start=20

Jen G.,"McFarland, WI",21,9,,1.0,12/9/2013,"I had not taken my family to RR in quite some time. Â Everyone was in the mood for burgers so it seemed like a good fit for a relatively inexpensive Friday night dinner. Â Pulling in the parking lot I was surprised at the lack of business - that should have been my first clue. Â We were seated promptly and our drink order was taken. Â Then we waited. Â And waited. Â Finally our drinks arrived and our order was taken. Â We ordered a small appetizer and bowl of soup with our meals. Â Again, we waited. Â Our appetizer finally arrived - but no soup. Â It was mediocre, and sadly, the best food we would have that evening. Our entrees arrived shortly after. Â It was then my husband asked if he could have his bowl of soup. Â Soon after the waitress arrived with a half filled bowl. Â It almost looked as though it had been full at one point, then dumped out. The fries were cold on all our meals. Â The burger I ordered well done, was extremely pink. I did not bother to ask for it to be corrected because at this point the whole experience was quite laughable. Â More than halfway through our entrees, a gentlemen in what appeared to be a manager's uniform, came to the table with a bowl of soup asking if it was ours. Â My husband laughed and told him, ""No, I already got this half full bowl."" A few moments later I bit into something hard, like bone, in my burger. Â At that point I was disgusted - and done. Â I would have told the waitress that the food (and service) was awful, but we were never asked. Â When she brought the bill she said she had taken the soup off the bill since it was only a 1/2 bowl. Â So my husband's comment must have at least made it back to her, yet there was no apology for it, nor the fact that he had to ask for it and received it after his entrÃ©e. $58.00 for 3 people, lackluster/slow service and terrible food?

Stopped in before Christmas, snow coming in and they were not busy. Â Lots of servers. Â Sat down to order and our waitress took our drink order, came back with it and told her we needed a couple more minutes to decide on our order. Â She never came back, I could see her behind the bar talking to the other servers, she wasn't busy. Â After about a half hour another server who seemed to have quite a few tables stopped by and asked if we were ok, I said no, we didn't seem to have a server. Â She took care of our table, seemed to try to talk to the manager about what was going on but he looked pretty disinterested. Â After we ordered our food our original server showed up, apologized and told me she had gotten busy behind the bar, honestly, lying is not the best policy, telling me she forgot would have worked better with me. Â At the end we tipped the server that actually helped us and did not leave a tip for the no-show server. Couple of other things, the bottomless fries are now a few fries in a little basket. Â Talked to some other locals and one had food served with wrappers from food products in her food. Â Other problems were mentioned, this location seems to be struggling. Â This could just be the Monona location or maybe Red Robins in general? Â We haven't checked out the East Towne location.

Lisa M.,"Madison, WI",15,42,,3.0,12/9/2013,"So I recall hearing a story on NPR about a reviewer in LA who reviewed all the restaurants on one particular street. It took a couple years because of the diversity and number of places on that street, but eventually he got to all of them. That sounded like a fun project to undertake, so I thought I'd do the same. Picking which street in Madison was kind of difficult, especially since you can stay driving on the same road and it'll change names like 4 or 5 times. I decided to pick one such road: Monona Dr which turns into Attwood Ave, which turns into Willy Street. There are so many great places on this road, some of which are already favorites, but others that I need to get around to visiting and reviewing. Now the journey begins.... It was a snowy December Sunday afternoon when I visited this Red Robin. The snow kept a lot of people away, but the place was still about a third filled. I was greeted and seated promptly. I've been to Red Robins before and I like to think of them as an easy place to go when my sister is in town visiting with her kids. Kids seem welcome here (they even can get a balloon) and since it's already a loud place, I don't mind when my niece and nephew act up (to say I'm not a kid person would be a great understatement). The burgers here are good with fun toppings. My go to is the A1 peppercorn burger which may rival Bob's Bad Breath Burger from the Weary Traveler when it comes to giving you bad breath afterwards. The onion bun along with the crispy onions on top definitely leaves you reaching for some gum after dinner. If you are feeling gluttonous, the never ending refills of steak fries can fill you up. When they are fresh and hot, they are pretty tasty, but if you are looking for crispy fries, this isn't the place for you. They had some boozy ice cream shakes on the menu that looked interesting, but I'm not in the mood for shakes in winter. Overall it's a decent place for burgers and fries if you don't mind that it's loud, there's tons of pop culture crap all over the walls, and that it's a chain.

If I ate meat, maybe I'd be cool with getting a burger elsewhere but this place has the ever elusive veggie burger as a substitute with any gourmet burger on the menu and they are DAMN good. Some things about Red Robin are less than satisfactory. Yes, it's loud. Yes, there is a lot of annoying chain cliches from your server asking if you've ever ate at RR before, every single time. The servers are good at being friendly and thus doing their job. I can't say I've ever had an incredible wait for either food, a server or my bill. They sing Happy Birthday! quite often which can also be quite annoying. There is often groups from sporting events, whatever that can be quite loud. But, did I mention, the vegetarian burger is DAMN good? This place is not like Denny's /Perkin's because they offer a vegetarian main course that is amazing(I didn't care much for Denny's Boca burger.) The prices are a little high.

Â  Was a busy evening, the wait was reasonable though at about 15 minutes for three of us. Shortly after being seated a young guest at another booth got sick on the floor. Â Our server, who was taking our order, immediately made a big dramatic scene about how she couldn't see stuff like that and ran off to the back. We then watched no less than 10 staff (not an exaggeration) walk by/over/around the prominent mess with no effort given to cleaning it up or acknowledgement to the guests around it. Â Finally a young man with a mop bucket full of dirty kitchen water showed up to mop up the mess... Â No thought given to the fact that it's a biohazard in a restaurant and obviously having no training in how to handle the situation.

mark w.,"Madison, WI",0,74,1,1.0,9/12/2011,"We went to Red Robin on Sunday to grab lunch. I ordered the guacamole burger. When it came out, there was little to no guacamole. No problem I thought, just ask for more on the side. We had to flag down the waiter after 5+ minutes of sitting there because no one checked on us. After bringing it to his attention, he said he would bring some more out and started walking away in a frustrated, hasty manner. We tried to stop him as he walked away to ask for more drinks and he said sure. We then tried to stop him again during this same exchange and ask for more fries. He turned and said okay and kept trying to walk away, but we didn't even have everything we needed. The last party member tried to ask for more of her side and he kept walking. We see him slam some menus into the menu holder by the host.  After 3 or so minutes, the guacamole came out, so now the burger has been sitting for around 10+ minutes and is now room temperature. It was flavorless, bland and quite pathetic for a chain that claims they have amazing burgers. For $10, it should have been a much better burger. It was the worst burger I can remember eating in the last few years. We were able to then ask him for our side of broccoli, which he just replied ""sure"", without any hospitality or sincerity. The broccoli then came out in about 10-15 minutes, after we were all done for our food. The manager did come out and apologize for the wait for our side of broccoli, and seemed sincere. I wish she was our waitress because we probably would have had a much better experience.  The only time we received service was when we had to ask for it. Other than once, we had to keep asking for our refills. Even when we waited for the check, we found ourselves just sitting there without any attention.
