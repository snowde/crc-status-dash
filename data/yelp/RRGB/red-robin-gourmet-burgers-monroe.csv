Daryl M.,"Monroe, WA",28,11,,5.0,12/3/2017,"Not a bad place at all to eat. When you are short on time and have to make lunch a quick one, this is a good place to go. Every server I have had here has been professional and prompt. I would suggest this Red Robbin to anyone. I have traveled around the US and they are pretty hit and miss.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroe
Kayla B.,"Seattle, WA",423,130,123,2.0,10/15/2017,"I love Red Robin but I was really disappointed with the experience here at this location. My friend and I wanted to order food to go, sit with a beer and munch on the bottomless fries as so frequently advertised, basically what this place is known for. I didn't have my ID, so we had to sit in the main dining area and placed our order to go. Not only did the food take at least 30 minutes to come out, but we had to request an order of fries three times. The server continued to forget so we had to keep asking,  then we finally got the smallest order of fries that we went through because our food took so long. Another server which looked like a manager asked if we needed anything and we asked for fries from her too. We never got our fries. When our food came, we let the server know we didn't get the sauces we asked for, and when she came back and asked if we needed anything, still no fries.  We were told they were coming and waited another few minutes before we decided apparently french fries are too difficult of a request so we were better off taking our food and going without wasting anymore of our time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroe
Kimberly L.,"Gig Harbor, WA",0,16,,2.0,10/9/2017,"Red Robin undoubtedly has good burgers. My boyfriend and I come here pretty much on a weekly basis and order the same burger. The last few visits though there's been a disconnect with the service and food. We've had to wait well over 30min and the last time it took that long for our waters to come and orders to get taken.  Tonight was kind of the last straw though. We sat in the bar hoping not to get missed this time, but instead had an incredibly rude waitress. We ended up speaking to the manager Jake. Usually we don't like to complain and aren't difficult to please (I just want a burger and fries!), but this waitress was something else. I still can't believe how blatantly rude she was.  The manager Jake is always hands on and hustling in the restaurant and catering to customers. It's very obvious he's the hardest working guy there. He ended up boxing our food up for us and taking care of the bill.  Not sure if we'll be back for a while though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroe
Eric R.,"Snohomish, WA",63,4,,1.0,9/4/2017,"Normally I sit down at a restaurant and say wow, this is taking a long time, but I don't track it. This time, I did. Time till seated: 10 minutes Time till greeted by server: 20 minutes Time till sever took order: 35 minutes Time till drinks arrived: 25 minutes Time till food arrived: 45 minutes Over two hours of waiting at six o'clock on a Monday night.

Nicole B.,"Louisville, KY",0,4,2,1.0,12/22/2017,"Went in a 1pm, looking for a spot to plug in computer and do college homework while on lunch. You should know that only one table has outlet and when I got there, there was a couple already seated. Hostess said that she would put me at a small table, and when the other one opened up, I would move to it. 30 minutes later, couple left and as I was packing my things to move, hostess seats other guests. Overall, this location has poor hospitality. When I was first seated, waitress immediately told me that the kitchen was slow and they were really busy. Overall, restaurant didn't seemed any more busy that other Red Robbin's at lunch. I wouldn't recommend this Red Robbin's location.

Upon delivery the fries were cold. Not warm. They were cold and appeared to be sitting out for quite awhile. Asked the waitress to feel one of the fries and even she was shocked. Not to continue on a negative rant, but have you ever had beer battered deep fried fish?  I really wasn't expecting the fish portions to be so  encased in batter that one couldn't locate the fish when cutting into the fish portion. Seriously!  Too much batter!!  So, this experience at the rockin robin was certainly a disappointment compared to previous visits with friends and family.

Rhema N.,"Tacoma, WA",18,17,6,1.0,9/2/2016,"Do you take medication that makes you constipated??? I don't  peronally, but I would like to recommend those who do to come to Red Robin on Monroe. SPECIFICALLY this Monroe location.  Last year I came here on an anniversary. Yes, it is NOT classy, but my ex and I were hiking Wallace Falls, and were famished. We both called out sick the next day with the worst BLOODY food bourne illness we'd ever had (Literally). I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I don't have these problems at the other Red Robins, it had to be a fluke...right? Oh how very wrong I was. Decided to go here with my current girlfriend, and it was a terrible mistake. The waitress decided  not to write down our order, so of course she got the whole thing wrong. After an hour od waiting for food, and spotty service I was irritated, but let events take theur course. It was not until the third time my order came back wrong that I just gave up. It was shocking that the manager came and did not offer to comp the dishes, however you bet your bottom dollar he did when I lifted up my nasty wet burger bun! And again, we both got ill. I am alwats sweet to servers, and I am pretty chill about letting things slide...but the illnesses and weird service here outweighs the positives, even the poor server who had to keep apologizing for the kitchens mess. Go to a different Red Robin location... Or your bowels will regret it!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroe
Brit F.,"Yakima, WA",0,7,,1.0,9/11/2017,"Been going to Red Robin for years as my husband use to manage the one in our old town. Came to this one in monroe and it was honestly the worse service/food I have received in over 15 years of going to Red Robin's. When we were seated it took our server over 20 mins just to come to our table to offer water or introduce herself ( the hostess had stated they were busy) by then we knew what food we wanted so we ordered our food ( regular cheese burger and a tavern double) and our drinks ( freckled lemonade and poppin purple lemonade) after waiting another 20 mins the purple lemonade was brought out but no freckled lemonade (and still no waters) Roughly 10 mins later the other lemonade was brought to our table. Shortly after our food came. Tavern double was just as ordered, hot but had cold fries. Cheeseburger was cold and had nothing but cheese, meat and bread. Before I could even say anything the server walked off. Push the button on the tablet to call the server back and waited. And waited. And waited. To the point the call button went off. Finally a different server was walking by and my husband stopped her and asked for a manager. Her response? I'll see if we have one  So a few mins later the manager (Jake) comes out from the kitchen and we tell him the cheese burger has nothing on it, fries are cold, our drinks have never been refilled, still no waters and we can't seem to located our server. He apologizes and says he'll fix the burger. Goes to the back and comes out in recited time with a fresh cheeseburger stating I was luckily because someone had just ordered one and it was in the window! (So he stole someone else's food huh) Anyways he says sorry again and is off. So my husband is done with his food and tries to entertain our daughter while I eat. Our server finally shows up and asks how everything is. We say we need more drinks as we've only received 1 in such a long wait. She says ok and leaves. We never see her again. After about another 15 mins my husband gets up and goes to the back to get me a to go box (the whole time the call server light is flashing on our tablet because we repeatedly push it) I pack up my food, pay on the tablet and we leave. Still never seeing our server, still never getting a refill on our expensive drinks ($5 a piece) and still never getting even water. As we walk out the restaurant really isn't that busy. We see our server chatting it up with some guy at the bar and the hostess has also disappeared. I truly love Red Robin. It was our home and our family when my husband managed the restaurant where we use to live. I always recommended it for its food and service. But this one? This Red Robin in monroe? I wouldn't send my worse enemy there. Unless you enjoy wasting at least an hour of your life on severely crappy service, cold and wrong food or you just love dying of thirst this is not the place for you. I'm honestly sad and disappointed in my whole experience",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroe
nathan d.,"Sultan, WA",0,34,18,1.0,3/3/2017,I used to love Red Robin and still do at pretty much any location other than Monroe.  This is the third time that they have made my food wrong but tonight they did nothing to solve the issue. And let's be honest take away burgers and they have nothing left.  I ordered like normal food came out dry and overcooked I mean the meat was charred and no moisture at all.  I pointed this out to my waitress tonight 4 yes I said 4 times she offered nothing and did nothing. Did not ask if I wanted a replacement did not ask if I would like to speak to a manger..

Sam R.,"Woodinville, WA",0,8,,1.0,4/13/2017,"This place is a burger joint right? Every time I've come to this location my burger has been overcooked and slopped together. And every time the server seems very indifferent about it. Don't get mad at me for the incompetence in your kitchen. Seems like they hire a lot of fast food cooks or something, although, you can get a much better burger for much less across the street at Carl's Jr.  On a side note, the lighting in the bar is egregiously bright. Also, patrons shouldn't have to tell employees what sporting event is on tv and ask to have the channel changed. You should have a schedule of all local and major sporting events and have them on. The crispy chicken sandwich is all I will eat anymore and it is the one bright spot on the menu.

I let them know that I can't eat it. (Also can't have deep fried anything) I get the burger back with a meat patty on it...... I was like okay. So I tell them again.. then it comes out a 3rd time.........they litterly just took the patty off. It was seriously greasy, smelled like meat and was super gross. So I'm a little pissed. I go tell them I would like my money back. As my table is done eating, and I am litterly still hungry. The manager tells me that they can just remake it. I tell them it's already been remade 3 times.

Cheri G.,"Sultan, WA",7,84,8,4.0,2/3/2016,"This location deserves another yelping! My mom & I recently paid a visit to a crowded dining room. No matter, we got a table fairly quick. Our server was pleasantly helpful and he walked us through the little tablet ordering/paying device on our table. These things are showing up at more eateries, which is a cool thing. We ordered small stack of onion rings, which were delicious. I LOVE that campfire sauce! My Caesar chicken wrap was perfect, as well as mom's seafood plate. Too much food, so half got boxed. The sweet potato fries were excellent and we loved the freckled lemonade with so many sweet strawberries! This place got a slight make-over, and sadly is missing those delightful merry-go-round horses. Still, a good place to eat with very good customer service.

I just recently relocated to WA and as such, just have a paper, temporary, government-issued ID while I await my new license. My boyfriend and I walked in to sit in the bar area as we have many times before and ordered freckled lemonade when were asked for identification. I handed our server my temporary ID along with my cancelled Texas ID. I was then told they would not accept my identification, as it was not plastic. I find that difficult to believe that you can fly on a plane with the temporary IDs but not sit in a bar at RR. If that is their bizarre policy then so be it I would have gladly obliged, but I was shocked when the server slammed my IDs on the table and demanded we leave the bar. When I asked to speak to a manager I was told with serious attitude that they had left for the night and that I needed to leave ... NOW.  As a server myself, I am shocked that Red Robin allows their waitstaff to treat their guests with such an awful attitude.

She returned with our food, and I finally had the chance to tell her I didn't want the drink she brought.

Nicole D.,"Seattle, WA",54,57,6,1.0,10/7/2015,Going quite downhill service wise in my opinion. They have these new tablets at the tables for you to use. Well they suck!! First off you have to pay $2 to use them! What a rip off but it doesn't really tell you until you nearly swipe and notice the tiny fine print that you'll be charged. The games on it are good for kids but not adults the trivia just keeps repeating. The wait staff just wants you to use them to reorder drinks and pay. It's a joke ! If you wanna pay with a card it's cool you swipe and go... But with cash you need to wait until the server spots your tablet flashing or until you can find them. The zucchini and mushroom app we had was smacking but the burgers were meh. For $15 they should have been amazing. We also waited about 15 min to get drinks and longer for food and it was literally 1pm it wasn't even that busy!

I'm really really really not one to complain or go out of my way to complain about a restaurant or to a waitor while dining, but this is ridiculous.

Eric P.,"Monroe, WA",0,17,10,2.0,6/27/2008,"I have just 5 words for you: ""SOME PINK or NO PINK?"" Those are the infamous words coming out of the so-called ""Gourmet"" Hamburger Restaurant known as Red Robin.   Red Robin would like to think of themselves as a ""Gourmet"" Hamburger Restaurant where they'll happily prepare your burger to your liking... as long as it's burned to 160°F or more.   Unfortunately, there is NO SUCH THING as a gourmet hamburger that's cooked to ""Some Pink"" or ""No Pink"", and Red Robin should be ashamed of deceiving their customers into believing there is.  The fact that they do this indicates one of two things: (1) They use questionable-quality ingredients in their meat, so they HAVE to burn the living heck out of the meat to keep their customers safe, or (2) their cooks aren't capable of properly cooking a piece of meat per actual well-established USDA guidelines.   Regardless of what your waiter or waitress tells you, the story typically varies from employee to employee. Some even try to blame the county by stating ""The county REQUIRES us to cook our meat to 165°F"" which is a complete lie. Chapter 246-215 WAC provides the safety standards for food served or sold to the public in Washington State. Washington adopted the 2001 edition of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Food Code, with some modifications. The relevant PDF is available here:  . The entire 108-page text is also available here for anyone brave enough to decipher it: Page 27, Section D states:  (D) A raw animal FOOD such as raw EGG, raw FISH, raw-marinated FISH, raw MOLLUSCAN SHELLFISH, or steak tartare; or a partially cooked FOOD such as lightly cooked FISH, soft cooked EGGS, or rare MEAT other than WHOLE-MUSCLE, INTACT BEEF steaks as specified in  (C) of this section, may be served or offered for sale in a READY-TO-EAT form if:      (1) The FOOD ESTABLISHMENT serves a population that is not a HIGHLY                               SUSCEPTIBLE POPULATION, and      (2) The CONSUMER is informed as specified under  3-603.11 that to ensure its                     safety, the FOOD should be cooked as specified under  (A) or (B) of this section; or...      (3) The REGULATORY AUTHORITY grants a VARIANCE from  (A) or (B) of this                         section as specified in 8-103.10 based on a HACCP PLAN that:           (a) Is submitted by the PERMIT HOLDER and APPROVED as specified under                        8-103.11,           (b) Documents scientific data or other information showing that a lesser time and                  temperature regimen results in a safe FOOD, and           (c) Verifies that EQUIPMENT and procedures for FOOD preparation and training of                FOOD EMPLOYEES at the FOOD ESTABLISHMENT meet the conditions of the                  VARIANCE. In other words, Red Robin COULD prepare burgers to order as long as they (1) Don't serve food to sick people, (2) They place a blurb in their menu stating that eating raw or undercooked food is potentially bad for you (which they already place in the menu), and (3) they request a ""variance"" from the state to serve food to order which would require employee training for food preparation and handling. The fact is, Red Robin won't do this because it's easier not to, and it's easier to just serve you an overcooked hamburger instead. How's THAT for ""Gourmet""? How long would Daniel's Broiler or Ruth's Chris Steak House stay in business if they only offered to cook your steak to ""Some Pink or No Pink?"" True ""Gourmet"" hamburgers are made from excellent quality meat and can be cooked to order. Rant aside, there are other aspects of Red Robin that make it well worth avoiding if you're truly looking for Gourmet food. The inconsistent wait-staff is one. Your mileage may vary when it comes to drink refills or basic attention to needs for napkins, forks, etc... I can easily recall several times when my glass spent more time empty than full. Iced tea that actually has ice in it is also tough for them to understand, and they've actually served me warm ""iced"" tea before. On the rare occasion when the food is prepared properly and the wait staff is on their game, the experience isn't awful by any means, especially compared to your other choices in Monroe. There's lots of room for improvement here, however, but they don't seem to be making much effort to change for the better, even though the General Manager, George Constantine, assured me they were. I don't want my burger to smile at me, Red Robin. _I_ want to smile because the food tastes good and because you prepared it the way I asked (and paid) you to prepare it. The only burger on their menu that's appropriately named is the ""Five Alarm Burger"". Go figure.

Holly M.,"Marysville, WA",18,4,2,3.0,11/7/2013,We were seated right away Unfortunately our waitress was M.I.A so we were about to leave when the manager noticed so we got a free meal and it was delicious.

Sam C.,"Monroe, WA",0,23,1,4.0,7/31/2014,"good food as far as corporate businesses go - same across all locations.   my date and i always sit in the bar area (no wait time, especially nice when it's busy). service used to be so-so in that area until i called the manager and told him about our complaints such as long wait times on food that we could see sitting on the counter for 10-15 minutes, no refills on water, troubles with being understaffed in that section, etc... since then (that was about a month ago) they have remarkably improved. good selection of drinks, mostly friendly service (except for taller asian guy behind bar who gives attitude/makes faces when customer's back is turned), and nice location next to the theater - as we like to pregame at rr then walk to the theater good and buzzin.  ****definitely try the alcoholic shakes!! i know they sound weird but trust me you will not regret it. the blue moon shake is ahhhhmazing!!!****",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroe?start=60
Jamie T.,"Gold Bar, WA",0,2,,1.0,8/30/2015,"Bad, bad experience.  They have these tablets at the tables now which seem to take more of the servers time to explain than they save.  Our food took over 40 minutes to get.  When the 8 top, who ordered after us, got thier food first, I flagged the server down to ask what happened to my food.  She said the kitchen was understaffed and behind, which seemed strange since they where able to get food out for the 8 top.  We didn't get water or our drinks refilled the whole time we where there and waiting.  She offered to bring us some appetizers to hold us over.  How about just the food that we orders... To kids macs and clucks and fries, not a lot or difficult.  Had to ask for utensils after we got our food, had to ask for a pen to sign the check... Twice!!  Never sent a manager to talk us... Didn't offer to comp anything, not even the $1.99 for the game I let my kids play while we waited.  Horrible, horrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroe?start=60
Wendy W.,"Woodinville, WA",238,243,230,4.0,4/10/2014,"For a chain restaurant this one is better than other Red Robins: Quick seating, good service, easy parking, and walking distance to movie theater and grocery store.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroe?start=60
Stacy Z.,"Bridgeton, NJ",45,224,2,4.0,4/5/2014,This is probably my favorite local Red Robin. They always have friendly service and usually fix their mistakes before I even notice them.  Service tends to be fairly quick too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroe?start=60
Katherine C.,"Seattle, WA",94,564,1017,3.0,10/19/2012,Great place to eat late at night after a show in Monroe.  The standard burger fare although I really love that Red Robin salt and their fries.  Service was sketchy... the young lady that was our server was canoodling with her boyfriend at the bar and around the corner from the bar....hard to get her attention to pay the bill....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroe?start=60
Kelly H.,"Gig Harbor, WA",11,20,1,2.0,9/3/2014,"Eating there is two hours of my life I won't ever get back.  Don't waste your time, drive somewhere else.   I'd write more, but I'm hungry after trying to eat at Red Robin.  Just don't bother.  It's not worth the time, energy or hassle to watch inept employees and even worse managers.    When you ask for silverware and they ignore you to talk on the phone (seriously happened), it's just not worth it to bother.  Stay away, go somewhere else.   5 guys just opened across the street.  It can only be better, cause it can't be any worse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroe?start=60
Rhonda M.,"Monroe, WA",72,4,,1.0,11/5/2014,"I was very hopeful that they'd get things correct, and that is where it ended.  I had party of 6 with me last night.  It wasn't too busy inside.  We were all seated then our order was taken.   That's where the problem begins.  Our food sat under the warmer for I would say anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes.  Long enough that when our food was finally served it was COLD.  I sent mine back, as well as my daughter sent her burger back.  The others that were with me ate theirs as they were hungry.  I refused any more food as this isn't the 1st time Red Robin has truly messed up my food. My daughter did get a hot burger served to her the 2nd time.  We also paid for and didn't receive our garlic fries the 2 of my kids ordered. Of course the manger finally came out from cooking in the kitchen to offer me some food, but at this point I'm just done.  It's been too many times they have truly served me bad/cold food.  It was never too busy that this should've happened. Very disappointed in Red Robin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroe?start=60
Diana W.,"Sultan, WA",0,24,,1.0,10/25/2015,"Never again. We went on Friday night and were surprised to get seated right away.  It took almost 45 minutes to get our food, though, and the whole time we were there (1:15 or so) there were 2 tables filled with dirty dishes, untouched.   The 2 tables that were pushed together for us each hosted an evil little computer squatter which was there to try to robotize the staff while selling the customer little games for $2.  It was supposed to be used to flag a wait person, reorder drinks, and swipe to pay at the end.  I think it led to worse service (""no one flagged me so I didn't check back"") and I would go to 5 Guys if I didn't want to get waited on (and I should have for the food this time!) and it crowded the already small table.  I am ticked at businesses that try to get rid of real people, when so many don't have a job, also, while trying to jack up the bill with little games,  discouraging people from actually talking during dinner (although it was so loud that we couldn't, really), and getting their squat little bases splashed with ketchup and grease.  The irony is that it didn't work when it came time to check out; somehow ours was supposed to be for another table across the restaurant, so the ""fast checkout"" actually slowed down 2 tables that night.  I guess the robots can't buss tables, either. Of course, eating out is about the food, right?  I was not that hungry (turned out to be a good thing!) and ordered a cup of clam chowder.  I had assumed that it would actually be a cupful; instead, it was 1/2"" of runny soup in a tiny square bowl that would have done well to hold a single lemon.  To add insult to injury, the square corners made it hard to get the last (11th---I counted) bite of soup.  It came with cold toast that was tasteless that sat there after the first bite.  My daughter's fries were cold, and my husband's salad was insipid. I've eaten there twice before since we moved here in July and those visits were OK, but this was the worst dining experience we have had in a long time and for the price we will either go to 5 Guys for better food at half the price or else to Mi Tierra, Benjarong, or Adam's bistro for a sit-down meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroe?start=60
Josie K.,"Monroe, WA",1,7,,4.0,2/3/2014,Typical red robin. Great place to bring the family including children. Can be loud. Burgers are always great.

Robert S.,"Lynnwood, WA",0,36,,1.0,6/24/2013,"Why is it that every time I sit in the bar area of this red robin, that I get the most crappiest service ever? I took my dad to lunch there on fathers day. It was busy that day so decided to get a table at the bar. I had a waitress that refussed to bring us water. Asked her 4 times for water and she just never brought it. She would bring the beer we ordered but not the water. Wtf? The service was so slow. When I wanted to order another beer she was nowhere to be found for 18 min. So I just ended up walking to the bar and getting everyone else at my table a beer myself. I was doing the waitresses job. And I wasn't the only table having to do this. I'm never going back to that red robin ever again.  DONT GO TO THIS RED ROBIN.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroe?start=60

Jennifer B.,"Monroe, WA",14,14,,4.0,10/18/2013,I'm impressed with their service. I didn't want to complain or get a free meal however I did want to make them aware that the Prime Rib Dip I ordered was very fatty and grisly. After I showed my waitress she went and showed her manager who immediately came over and told me she wouldn't want to eat that either and removed it from my bill. Plus I got a free dessert due to my Royalty card. It was a good night. Thank you RR!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroe?start=60

D. W.,"Mountlake Terrace, WA",0,106,23,2.0,1/5/2016,"First I parked in lot. Then walked towards the restaurant. There was no entrance ! Walked around to left looking for a way in, but found a dirty garbage area and supply truck and employee type entrance, no public door. Walked past that to the street side and found out that either the restaurant was put on the property backwards facing the wrong way, or the parking lot is where the restaurant is supposed to be, or the restaurant is where the parking lot is supposed to be. Something is bass ackwords here. Very strange. Got inside and was seated. Waited. Waited. Then a waiter walked by and said he would be right with me. Waited again. My lunch is only 40 minutes long. Left after 10 (?) minutes of waiting. Went across the street and grabbed something quick and hit the road. Have eaten at other Red Robins many times with no problems before, and they are facing the right way in relation to property and parking LOL ! Tip - after parking, walk around the left not right, and go around behind the building, that's the public entrance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroe?start=60
