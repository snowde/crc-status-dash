Mike V.,"Murfreesboro, TN",288,121,270,4.0,9/10/2017,"Red Robin has some really good burgers, salads, and sandwiches, but are in my opinion too expensive for what you get. That said, I absolutely LOVE the Teriyaki Chicken and the Whiskey River Chicken sandwiches. But I tend to make them at home instead of coming here very often. Though I will say. Red Robin's teriyaki sauce is hard to beat. Their burgers are great top notch also! The Sautéed Shroom, the A1 peppercorn, and the Burnin love are all great!  I'd go there more often if the menu was a little better priced. I just can't see paying $70 - $80 bucks for burgers and fries for a family of 5 no matter how good they are. I'd rather go have a nice meal and enjoy a few margaritas for that price. But if you like good burgers, salads, and probably the best teriyaki chicken sandwich besides mine - give them a shot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-murfreesboro
Quentin T.,"Nashville, TN",79,83,109,4.0,5/17/2017,I have only been to this Red Robin twice The first time was years ago and I was not too impressed as the service was slow and the food didn't taste all too good. The second visit happened because I had locked myself out of my vehicle in the nearby parking lot and had to kill some time before help arrived.  I sat in the bar area and ordered some chicken tenders and mac n cheese (it was lunch time and i was mad so i had to calm myself) the server was super nice and after i finished my meal I told her i was going to hang around for a bit due to my situation. She was understanding and even brought me some french fries for free while I waited.  If you are going to lock yourself out of your vehicle this is not a bad place to wait for a rescue in my book.

Robert E.,"Murfreesboro, TN",215,153,,4.0,10/12/2017,"Lunch at Red Robin with a friend. Easy parking and access into the restaurant. Was immediately greeted by host staff, even though I was waiting for other member of our party to arrive. As soon as he arrived we were seated. Of course the lunch menu has an abundant selection of burgers and fixings. My favorite remains the Royal Red Robin with the fried egg. It was juicy and cooked as requested. Our wait staff kept our drinks filled. The restaurant  was pretty full with patrons but the noise level wasn't too loud, we could carry on conversation without shouting.

They have a very big selection of burgers and not just burgers but other main dishes as well. I got the Royal Burger with the egg on top, it was great! Cooked just how I like it. My mother got the Sirracha Burger and it ended up being pretty spicy. Try the dipping sauces too, they are worth it. Could give a little more fries when it comes to the ""unlimited fries,"" though.

It's just becoming a little frustrating. They apologize and a manager will bring my burger out, but that's the extent of it.  They seem to be a little less consistent as of late as well.

Beth F.,"Murfreesboro, TN",28,56,57,2.0,9/4/2015,"We hadn't been here in a while, and were craving the tall stack of onion rings, so decided to pop in for lunch.  Things have changed a bit there, one being the automatic order/pay system at the table (that they just put in last week) which is cool! That being said and with high expectations of ring enjoyment, we started out ordering the rings on the ""auto box"", and when they quickly arrived they were under cooked.  No problem, there's a button to call your Server over and she came running (perfect)!  New order submitted, and since she was there we gave her our Diet Coke order and looked thru the new menus. We gave her our order, and when the new rings were up they were cooked right, but we both noticed that the flavor was ""good"" but not quite what we remembered them tasting!  Don't know if the oil had been or needed to be changed, or if the batter is different, but something was ""off"".  The meal came and the sandwich (never before tried BLTA croissant) was ""meh""... Then I wanted to use the auto box to reorder our cokes, and to my surprise, you CAN'T!  You can order beer, floats, shakes, alcohol but NO WATER or SODAS!!!  Excuse me?  So you either wait until your Server comes back around or hit the ""Server"" button on auto box, but you could really cut out a step by having that option available - right?! Then the last insult to injury when we had a hankerin' for yummy rings was that they didn't take the rings off the ticket.  Now we may be ""old school"" but we think it is proper service etiquette to remove improperly prepared items off of someone's ticket!  So when we noticed this gaffe we also noticed that our Server forgot to charge us for the cokes.  Asking her about this (we thought that maybe because they aren't on auto box that they may be free) she said, ""Oh, I should have charged you... Hang on and I'll ring you up! Thanks for being honest!""  What?  After charging us for the bad rings you're gonna snap us for cokes? So she comes back with a ticket for 2 cokes @ $2.75 ea. = $6+ after tax. :/  we paid both bills, and my husband said it best, ""I don't ever need to come back..."" Sorry Big R, too many changes?  Too big for your breeches?  Service etiquette gaffe?  Food not-to-die-for?  ""Hasta la vista, Baby!""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-murfreesboro

Gabrael A.,"East Austin, Austin, TX",4,32,,5.0,1/20/2010,"OK, usually, I'm not the biggest fan of the friday's, the chili's, etc..., but this place really impressed me.  I had to go here because I was meeting some friends there and it was their decision.  With already low expectations, I ordered the burnin' love burger.  I was blown away!  The meat (medium with some pink) was excellent, it was very well seasoned,  and the jalapenos were perfect but the bread was was set it apart from all the others for me.  The bread brings it all home....probably the best hamburger bread I have EVER had.   Like I have mentioned, I have high skepticism towards places like this so I had to make sure that this was not a fluke.  During lunch, I went to another Red Robin location in La Vergne and had the same burger and the same experience.

Jessica B.,"Bowling Green, KY",26,146,27,3.0,1/30/2014,"Ate on a very slow Sunday night last week. They were playing them Grammys on the tv so my mind was occupied. I got my go to burger, the Prime Chophouse burger. It seems they've changed some things since last time I was there. New menu layout and new presentation of the food. You don't get as many fries with your burger so you have to ask for a refill if you're a fan of the fries. The burger was amazing as usual and my dinner date agreed that his burger was awesome as well. The only real reason for the loss of stars is the service. I've never been keen on the service here anyways but our server left a lot to be desired. She was neither here nor there when we needed her and once the check came she was very pushy to get us to pay. Multiple times she came to the table asking if she could take our bill yet. It was extremely rude and nerve racking. My dinner date and I were trying to just sit and enjoy the Grammys on tv for a bit before leaving but apparently that wasn't satisfactory for the server trying to cash out and leave.

Holly G.,"Oldsmar, FL",19,161,93,3.0,6/2/2015,"I don't usually like to eat at a lot of chains as I'd rather support small or local businesses. But Red Robin is a pretty safe bet for a decent hamburger. My boyfriend and I have been to the Murfreesboro location a couple times (among others) and the service is generally the same, regardless of the location. Lots of college age people working there, decent service, but nothing that goes above in beyond (in general). They always have a lot of seasonal offerings, which I can appreciate. I like a little variety in the menu. This time I opted for the Southern Charm burger, as it sounded fairly promising. Candied bacon, honey BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, and caramelized onions. Sounds great in theory. Just came out meh. But, it's a chain restaurant, and I've never been to a chain where my mind was just blown. Decent location, although it's always fairly busy, even later at night like 8:00 or 8:30 we've had to wait 15-20 minutes to be seated. Prices are fairly high, but that's universal.

What a shocker!!!  Anywho ... we were lucky enough to sit at the high top table close to the bar when you first walked in the door. It took a while to get our drinks, but our food came out in no time. I ended up having their Chicken Wrap sandwich with fries.

The other entrée the forgot the tomatoes and pickles.  A sleep at the wheel in the BOH! Check for 2 before tip $25.46 (no cocktails) Looks like you could be taking chances at the RR, dine at your own risk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-murfreesboro?start=20
Victoria E.,"Lancaster, CA",3,16,,3.0,11/15/2015,"My friend and I ordered burgers and drinks.  My burger did not have tomatoes but by the time our server checked on us I had already eaten half the burger.  I asked her about the missing tomato slices and she said ""Oh they must be messing up in the kitchen."" No apology, no offer to bring a new complete burger.  She returned with two thin tomato slices on a plate and walked away.  By this time, I had eaten almost all the burger..  On the way home, my friend said his double Tavern burger had only one hamburger patty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-murfreesboro?start=20
