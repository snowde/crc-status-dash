Bsa B.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",0,16,,5.0,10/16/2017,The trick to having a great experience here at Red Robin is the wait staff  Phil is a great floor manager and he has two great servers that make the difference  Shakira and Valerie  if they are not working then my experience will be ok and lacking  If Valerie or shakira are combined with Phil your experience will be great,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-myrtle-beach

Jim T.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",89,30,3,3.0,8/4/2017,"We felt that Red Robin was overpriced for what you get.  Sure you get unlimited fries, but there is only so many fries you can eat.  The interior seemed a little bit in disrepair.  Several of the booths were mended with red tape. I don't think that we will be back.  Much better places in Myrtle Beach to get a burger and fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-myrtle-beach
Neil P.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",175,82,158,3.0,12/18/2016,"I can so see the bottom of those bottomless fries... My server was great and the food was decent but the prices left me paying awful close attention to every bite. I've found if I start out making the stink face at the prices, chances are I won't be won over by the end of the evening. Such was the case here.  I'm big on the word 'appropriate' in ""price appropriate."" 28.00 for a burger and 2 shakes (before tip) just set a bad tone with me. For those prices I expect to find the antidote in my burger!  I was also with a guy who got the bottomless fries. They actually make this process so difficult that it practically deters one from ordering more, which I suspect is rather the point. Seriously, they bring you like 8 fries and then you have to flag down the server, order again and wait for another 8 fries. They really need to boost the serving size; it boarders on the absurd. Now, I don't know about you but after I've eaten, I just want to give the guy my cash and go. Not so fast here...my server had to give us a class on how to use the tabletop checkout  machine because they don't give paper tickets. Press here if you want to split the ticket, press here if you want to add or subtract an item and put it in the other persons column, press here for the tip, press here for....""dude, that's what I pay you guys for - just take my cash and bring me my change so I can leave!"" So, yeah, not a fan of the self checkout. It was truly like the ""common core"" equivalent of paying for a meal. Twice as difficult than it needed to be. I just want to give you my card or cash...you give me some change and/or a receipt and I get to leave. I felt like I needed divorce papers to get out of here. Anyway, 3 stars for a clean restaurant and attentive server. The prices and the laborious check-out would give me pause in the future. How about this. You want to trouble your patrons to check themselves out, take 20% of the meal for saving the server the effort. After all, our time is valuable too! Most of us are tired of seeing a tip jar on every counter as it is; now even the most rudimentary of table service is becoming self service. Maddening! (end of rant) - Neil Be sure and follow me on Yelp for other Myrtle Beach reviews. I live here so chances are if I like something, you'll dig it too. See that little icon under my name to the left that says, ""Follow this person on yelp?""...click that! We'll be buds! Seriously, do it. I'm shallow and need that sort of validation in my life.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-myrtle-beach

The only reason they didn't get 5 stars was the Ghost Pepper burger. I am a true Chile-head. The sauce tasted very heavily of cumin and black pepper, with just a hint of Ghost Pepper. When I ask for heat, I want heat, damn it, not a wimpy sauce that pretends to be hot. Why bother? Maybe they're afraid some wuss will ask for a refund because they can't handle it. Tough.

We all got exactly what we wanted.  We had a bacon cheeseburger, and burger with all things spicy (and a huge jalapeño on top), two burgers customized just the way wanted, and then for me (the odd one out) I had an awesome Gardenburger with a lettuce bun instead of regular roll.  We all had endless fries and ate way too much!  We were celebrating a birthday and they came and sang to the birthday girl and allowed us to bring our own cake.  It is excellent all around, including the price!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-myrtle-beach

We settled on coming here because everyone wanted a burger. Our server was very nice, especially for it being the end of the night. The Merry Moscato Punch was so amazing!!! And not that expensive. Two positives! I had the chicken Terryaki sandwich and bottomless fries. It was good but I wish I had gotten a burger, especially since that's what they're famous for. I don't like their bread. Nothing like picking up and sandwich and the bread crumbling in your hand. I'll definitely be back though. There are a lot of options. Maybe too many.

Larry S.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",6,8,1,2.0,12/20/2015,"We went to dinner last night at this Red Robin.  It was the worst experience ever at this location.  First they sat us right under an air conditioning vent and it was blowing cold air.  I was told that they were not able to do anything with it since it is controlled by corporate out in Colorado.  Usually airconditioning is not so bad but when it is 30 degrees outside it does make the restaurant feel like it is also 30 degrees.  We moved to another table and this was about 10 minutes before anyone even came over to us even just to take drink order.  That was before we moved.  After the  move we had a waiter named Dillon.  He is the reason we gave this review a 2 star instead of 1 or even zero,  He took our order and he was fantastic.  I did order my burger medium and it came out black on the outside.  I did not even have to cut into it to see that it was way too done for me.  Also, before we even received our food, the table next to us was getting up to leave.   Normally that is good unless they came in well after us which they did,. We were there literally two hours for no reason other than a real slow kitchen.  Management knew nothing of the problems that we had but Dillon did get a manager for me at my request and they took care of me by taking care of my meal.  Last night was just a bad night but when everything got straightened out the food was actually good.  I do appreciate Dillons patience with me because after a bit I was getting prretty upset.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-myrtle-beach?start=40
Beth H.,"Sedgefield, Charlotte, NC",2,16,45,3.0,7/10/2013,"July 5, 2013 Lunch There was a bit of a wait. Not more than 10 minutes.  There were four adults and one child in our party. This Red Robin is located at the Coastal Grand Mall. There is plenty of parking.   We were seated at three tables pushed together. You know how they never fit together evenly. Hate that! There must be a better way.  This is a burger place.  My son-in-law ordered the Patty Melt. Cheese burger on toasted swirl rye bread thousand island dressing and choice of cheese. He asked for it to be lightly toasted not too hard. He has braces. It seemed like a simple request but I guess it was too difficult for the cook.  I ordered the Ensenada Chicken Platter.  Can you say Yuck because I can!  I won't be ordering that again.chicken tasted like it had been defrosted in the microwave and partially cooked or freezer burned. I ordered it on the recommendation of our wait person. Next. My daughter ordered the sautéed 'Shroom Burger. No complaints. It was excellent!  Hubby ordered the Southwest Grilled Chicken Salad. He said ""Excellent! He would definitely order again.  Little one ate a little bit of everyone's food and some of the appetizer. Which was house made chips and onion dip. He loved them!

Drew L.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",469,155,,2.0,5/31/2012,"I have been to this location twice within the past month. The menu is pretty much the same as the locations in NC and California. Red Robin is consistent in that you can pretty much have your favorite menu items no matter where you are. There is nothing surprising in that aspect. The food is good but certainly not anything to rave about. It's a burger and fries place.  The problem here is the service. It's not good. Our server was Michael and I got the impression from the time we were seated that he was not happy to have another table. We experienced unreasonable long waits for drinks, appetizers and our burgers. In the time between the long waits, we didn't see our server at the table. That was disappointing because we needed more drinks, etc.  A retaurant like this is not going to wow you with their menu. It doesn't change. These places have to wow you with good service and friendly servers who make you want to come back. That didn't happen for us either time.

Sally F.,"Manchester, MD",0,16,1,5.0,6/29/2016,"Delicious food! We sat at the bar during busy dinner time. The bartender, Leah, was very helpful and attentive. She helped me choose lower calorie options for the food that I really wanted. They will do any burger with a junior patty. Nice! Our burgers were terrific and my side salad was fresh and yummy. We have always had great visits at Red Robin, regardless of where we are.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-myrtle-beach?start=20
Lori B.,"Davidson, NC",14,6,,1.0,3/30/2016,Horrible! Advertised as kid friendly but obviously not! We were given a 15 to 20 min. wait time at 2pm in the afternoon. Waited for 30 min. watched as 8 to 10 different parties where seated including a larger party than ours that had all entered the restaurant after we had arrived! When we asked why we had not been seated.  We where told it was because we had children??!!!??! Really? I've never been discriminated against for having children before so this was a 1st for me! Especially in a restaurant chain that advertises as child friendly.  This establishment needs to release all their managers and start new.  Have been to several Red Robins in other states and they have all been excellent. This location is one to completely avoid lacks common curtsy or customer service!!!!! Just bad management!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-myrtle-beach?start=20
Ada C.,"San Diego, CA",1,40,9,3.0,4/21/2016,"This visit my server was great. Dinner time so a bit busy for a Thursday night, but took a little too long to get waited on and for my food to arrive. The burger  (which is a usual fur me)was not as good as in the past. The cheese was barley melted,almost cold.Fries were good, but not top quality like I've had in the past.

Dana F.,"Port Wentworth, GA",66,13,22,5.0,6/24/2014,"Cannot say enough good things about Red Robin. I LOVE the food but the service at this location is amazing. I always sit in the bar area because Matt is friendly and personable. He makes the experience even better. There is also another gentleman working in the bar area who is the most upbeat, friendly guy I've seen. What a pleasant environment to enjoy lunch or dinner. Oh, and, the burgers are out of this world! Ps: ask for garlic parm fries!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-myrtle-beach?start=20

Carol H.,"East Harlem, Manhattan, NY",0,7,,1.0,6/2/2016,When you walk in you are overcome with the smell of stale urine. It smells like a neglected bathroom at a truck stop. We saw a large industrial blower running on the floor in the kitchen. We were seated and waiting for our server but we just could get past the smell in this restaurant. We left. Very in fortunate.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-myrtle-beach?start=20
Ryan F.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",2,34,7,2.0,8/16/2015,"So the start on my first Red Robin experience.  Couldn't get a seat. Not because they were that busy because once we got in there were a lit of empty tables.  So I am thinking understaffed. When we showed up were told 20-30 min wait. Ok not great but the family voted that we would wait it out. So we began our wait outside, we were the only ones sittting outside. When enough space opened up to come sit and wait inside we moved on in. Now as our time got close a party of 5 walked up, said they had been waiting outside and had missed their names being called. The hostess stood strong at first, and told them they would have to go back on the list. Good job, but then one of the mother's started complaining about how its not fair they missed their call and they have kids and what ever else she said. Well the hostess caved and bumpes everyone back a few spots to support moving this party of five in.  Now I'm sorry but that is not right and when we spoke with the manager he did nothing to correct the issuse.  So even with the good service we got from our waiter and the food was pretty good. I am unsure if I will be eating at Red Robin again. $54.00 is a lot for 4 bugeres and 4 waters and a small stack of rings to not be treated fairly. Or at least have the manager check on us during our meal and apologize but maybe my customer service skills are just better than Red Robins...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-myrtle-beach?start=20
Britney F.,"Zuni, VA",34,17,2,1.0,8/14/2015,"Well the food was just ok...nothing great. The service was terrible ! We were sitting at our table for MORE than 20 minutes before our waitress even took our drink order! Took another 30 minutes after that before our food arrived. We had ""bottomless"" fries and it took forever to get a refill on those. I could understand if the place was busy...but it wasn't. In addition the do not give our military any discount.  We will NOT return!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-myrtle-beach?start=20

Duane L.,"Plattsburgh, NY",0,3,,5.0,4/9/2011,"Salads are always the best you can get anywhere, but the best thing about the Myrtle Beach location is the manager (Andrew).
