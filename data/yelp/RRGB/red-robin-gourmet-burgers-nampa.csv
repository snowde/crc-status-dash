Jewel S.,"Nampa, ID",0,17,67,5.0,12/22/2017,I tried the honey chicken wings. They were yummy. The burgers are also always a good pick. The milk shakes are good but they don't give you enough even when you order the monster shake. It seems like they have gotten more expensive lately but the food is always tasty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nampa
Patrick M.,"Elk Grove, CA",58,117,3,1.0,12/29/2017,"Filthy. Carpet is sticky, bathroom sinks are moldy, table is sticky. Sent my drink back because there were mouth food particles in it. Plate had remnants of a previous diner's entree on it. Cold fries. Burger was a disheveled mess, and had a soggy bun. About 25% occupied on a Friday evening, so there is a bad sign too. Stay away. The management here needs to be fired. If you need to spend 40.00 for two burgers which are less than you would get at Carl's Jr., this is your spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nampa
Diane O.,"Denver, CO",36,109,81,1.0,8/22/2017,"After 7 days outside at a festival, all I wanted was a delicious hot meal. While the ordering online, to go, was useful, overall everything about the food was awful. My boyfriend got the mac and cheese double burger- the burger came with only 1 patty and about 7 fries. He also got nachos which were soaked in grease, hard cheese, and lacking in toppings.  I ordered the grilled cheese and side salad.  I'm not sure if it was because we ordered ""to-go"" or just that they were 30 minutes from closing, but the grilled cheese was awful. The clump of cheese wasn't even melted and the bread was buttered in one small area and barely toasted at all. Then there was hardened cheese on one side of the bread. It was completely gross and a huge dissapountment after 7 days outside and 8 hours on the road. Just awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nampa
Kindra M.,"Caldwell, ID",6,19,,1.0,10/21/2017,"This review is for the ToGo service. Absolute crap from the start. They messed up the order twice giving us wrong drinks and not following the directions in the notes. The prices are the same for smaller portions than what you would get inside. Our order ""wasn't ready"" but brought out cold food. My husband had to walk in 3 different times because they never gave him his drink, our silverware, or the ranch for my salad. We ordered fried mushrooms and it honestly looked like wheat thins! Haha it was a bunch of fried batter, no mushrooms. I enjoy my experience at Red Robin, however I will never order ToGo from here EVER again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nampa
Adam N.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",53,15,1,4.0,8/31/2017,Great place to eat. Don't come here a lot but this time it was a bit of a wait for a chicken salad. The salad was good. Would order it again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nampa
John H.,"Caldwell, ID",14,120,2,1.0,12/21/2016,"In the final analysis, I think the ""answer"" here is never, ever eat at a restaurant where the menu is dominated by pages and pages of photographs, depicting the food items. What, they can't simply describe the items, without a photo? Maybe the menu is designed for folks who can't read, I don't know; those customers can, then, just point to a photo and say, ""Me wants dat."" I ordered the ""Prime Chophouse Burger"" ($9.69), which is described as: "" ... distinguished and delicious, this juicy burger is layered with horseradish-sauteed mushrooms, gourmet steak sauce, provolone cheese and piled high with crispy onion straws. served on an onion bun with creamy country dijon sauce."" The burger was okay, but barely. The bun was soft, soggy, and tasteless.  The thing was served with french fries, which had the consistency of balsa wood, dry, tasteless, and not cooked well enough. The only thing that made the fries go down, was a copious amount of ketchup and, thank gawd for small favors, there was lots of that. On one level, I could argue that I got my money's worth, because the burger was repeating on me for hours after that, burp! They should serve complimentary Alka Seltzer as an after-meal drink. The waitress was so obsequious, she was driving me nuts. She must have stopped by my booth ten times, while I was trying to eat this thing. Yes, it is good if a waitperson checks-in on a customer during a meal, ""Everything okay?"", something like that, but this was over the top; it finally became annoying. I was sitting there thinking, ""Oh, gawd, here she comes, again."" She clearly was trolling for tips. Never again, not even on a bet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nampa
Joshua A.,"Nampa, ID",57,3,1,1.0,8/22/2017,"I ordered a bacon burger based on the picture and I understand it won't always look like that but my bacon looked NOTHING close to the concept of that burger. Had I known, I would have just gotten the regular burger. No visit from the manager even with me bringing it up. I paid full price and I was okay with that because that's what I ordered, but not even a hey sorry we ran out of the real bacon and we had to use this junk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nampa
Shannon B.,"Prosser, WA",0,11,,1.0,4/12/2017,"I usually love eating at Red Robin, but I should've read the reviews. The service was terrible. I was alone so I sat up at the bar. The bartender took my order but never gave me any silverware and I had to reach behind to another table for salt and ketchup. The fries were cold and inconsistently cooked. Some were raw while others were so stale they tasted like they had been sitting under the light all night....fry refills? No way!!  What was the worst was the other waitresses kept coming up and having conversations with the bartender that were completely unprofessional. Apparently one waitress recently quit. They were all sharing that when it's time for them to quit they are going to get their entire section filled and walk out on all her tables. What??!!! The food was mediocre the service was terrible and I will never be back.

Not only are their fries AYCE,but they have some awesome sauces for dipping. The garlic aioli and bacon aioli are both really good. It does cost extra for the premium sauces,but there worth it.

Shelle M.,"Nampa, ID",88,61,51,3.0,2/11/2015,"I came here with some friends on a Monday night and was seated in the bar area right away.  The waiter was very friendly and got our drink order right away. What I wasn't expecting while we waited for our meal was the the air conditioning being on, it is February. To say it was cold was an understatement,  I needed a down parka to make me warm. Maybe it's their way  to get you out the door quickly.  I order the BLTA Croissant with fruit as a side instead of the standard fries.  I was very happy with my choice as the sandwich was very tasty and the fruit was great complement.  Sadly the server never asked if we wanted dessert instead he brought us our checks.  We stayed and visited for another 20 minutes and I am pretty sure he could have twisted three ladies arms for some dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nampa?start=20
David W.,"Nampa, ID",0,7,13,1.0,6/30/2015,"What a sad visit. My wife and I arrived at 3:55. We waited 5 minutes to be greeted by host. We were led to a table that was sticky and salt covered. It took our server(Tara) 5 minutes to greet us. She took our order, came back in about 5 with our drinks and appetizer. There was a piece of lint cooked into the onion ring. Shortly after that we got our burgers, not the pink we ordered, well done. Flavor almost made up for fact burgers were overcooked, almost. I noticed wife didn't get the sweet potatoes as ordered, they came much later, glad we didn't get charged for them. All the while we had to look at dirty tables, dead flies in window sill and staff eating and hanging out by kitchen in booth. I noticed several manager types, appeared to be doing line check in kitchen. I'm not sure though because we never got table visit.

J J.,"Kuna, ID",2,11,1,2.0,6/7/2016,"With so many other cool places to eat in the Treasure Valley... I'm done with Red Robin. I've tried 4-5 times to like this place. It's always packed so I figured I was missing something. Nope, they're just not that great. Today the kid's meal was ridiculously skimpy... the 6 tiny meatballs... the fruit cup served in one of those black ketchup cups. I got the Whiskey Burger. I swear I could SEE the BBQ sauce on there, but couldn't taste it. And burger patty is also suspicious. I think it's frozen into perfect circles with a TON of fillers.. and then slapped on the grill frozen. So little taste. Gross, even. Why am I giving them 2 stars and not 1? Well their decor is kinda cool... and the fries are good. *shrug* Seriously though... for the prices you can get better food at any of the local burger or BBQ joints. Or even Burger King's whopper is better than their burger. More flavor!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nampa?start=20

Additionally they all appeared to be at least moderately happy to be working. The server was great, the food was perfect.

This is would have been different if we had done something or said something.. But we had done nothing but been nice to her.. Then after we moved they proceeded to stand there and talk about us where we could hear and see.. Gossip style.. Not impressed whatsoever! Decent food.. always one of my favorite food wise..

Lisa C.,"Nampa, ID",26,1,,2.0,7/21/2015,The food was good as usual but the restaurant itself is very dirty . We sat next to the wall with all the pictures and it was quite gross. You could see how the ledge up against the wall hasn't been dusted in months as well as the lights. The pictures on the wall had finger prints and dried food on them. We had to ask for forks for our food and had to wait a bit before we got them. Oh I almost forgot about our glasses that had dried food on the inside of the glass and lipstick marks on two of our beverages.

Andrew M.,"Boise, ID",68,62,30,1.0,10/3/2013,"First off the burgers tasted great, the fries were okay. But the waitress was absolutely inattentive apparently expecting the cooks to bring our food out exclaiming, ""Oh he was suppose to bring that out...."" before waddling off to go banter (within eye-shot of all tables) with other staff. It was kind of funny to watch table after table get seated yet see no one take orders, bring drinks. I think it took us 20 minutes to get an extra ""cup"" of their ""bottomless fries"". Which is another thing, put the fries on the plate next to the burger. Don't get fancy with your mediocre handful of fries. The burgers were already smaller and 2 bucks more than nearly any other place in town that serves a decent burger. Really dissapointing place.

My granddaughter had one bite of her 5.00 kids burger spit it out and said eeeeeewwwww! Couldn't agree more. When I asked waitress what the deal was she proceeded to ignore us to the point I had to find someone else to pay. I gave him my ticket and a hundred dollar bill and 15 minutes later he brings me a five and ten ones. My bill was  $18.62! No way was I leaving them a 65.00 tip! Unimpressed in the extreme!

Joey B.,"Caldwell, ID",9,41,17,3.0,1/5/2015,"This place is good for a lunch meal. Nothing that really ""wows"" you or is all that impressive. The food is generally pretty good and filling, the endless fries helps with that. I usually eat the buffalo clucks, which are generally pretty good if you like breaded chicken strips. I've had several of their various burgers, all of which seem ok and pretty standard. I've also had their whiskey river chicken wrap as well, which seems to be much less tasty here lately for some reason I cannot explain. It almost tastes like they've started making it differently. My mother in law also thinks so, as this is her ""go to"" red robin dish. They have some new burgers on the menu that appear to be more gourmet and have better beef than their regular burger counterparts, but I can't figure out how they are really all that much better. Frankly they must be pretty proud of these gourmet burgers, because some of them are almost 15 bucks a pop. They must be made from dragon meat and seasoned with orphan tears or something, I don't know. I just know I have a hard time paying that much for a hamburger. Bottom line is it isn't a bad place to eat, but not a fantastically wonderful place either. Pretty middle of the road.

Dev C.,"Nampa, ID",6,41,27,2.0,4/14/2010,"Their ""garden burger"" patties are completely tasteless. Okay, pretty much every veggie burger patty is tasteless, but that's why you ADD FLAVOR to them while they grill (or steam, or whatever the heck they do to cook their pucks here). I could forgive them for that, but the sad thing is my mom said her beef burger was bland as well. This coming from a woman who barely even uses her spice rack and complains when I add more than 3 herbs to a dish. What gives? At least they offer a meatless alternative and will sub out their meat patties for the veg on any of their classic burgers.

A few weeks back, I went with my family (my mother, father, 3 yr old daughter and myself). My mom and I got there before my dad and daughter. I asked the host for a booth and a high chair, she quickly told me she couldn't put me at one because they have a step up and they can't put high chairs there. I wanted to be sat because they were filling up quickly so I said yeah ok fine and was sat with a boster seat. We ordered. Our waiter was amazing. He was attentive and nice. Anyways, my daughter started to hit the want to get up stage right as our food got to our table and my dad had already gone out to the car when I noticed another family at a booth with a high chair. So I asked for a togo box for my dads food and to speak to the manager. The manager Kevin was friendly and nice. He apologized for the hosts not telling us we could have waited for another booth so we could have had the high chair for my daughter. He also comped my dads meal. That's an amazing manager.

Yum.  Service was prompt and pleasant.  My friend got a chicken dish and said it was tasty.  Our drinks were kept pretty much refilled which was no small feat for the young waitress attending to us as she was also the bartender for the evening.  The reason for the 3 stars, is Red Robin you still over season your fries!!  I would prefer no seasoning to fries drenched in season-salt.  Also when a new burger is introduced, put the price on the flier, table topper, whatever, I was surprised when the check came and those types of surprises are not pleasant.  Still usual, good consistent food and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nampa?start=40
J B.,"Boise, ID",80,26,,3.0,4/5/2010,"I am a rare attendee at any corporate chain like this one. But since I stopped in on 4/4/10 for a sandwich It deserves some stars. Now I had the croissant turkey, bacon and avocado sandwich with a pesto aoli and a cup of French Onion soup. To be honest I was surprised on how good it was. Everything was fresh and tasty. The bar staff was really friendly, they even change the basketball game over to the Houston Open for me. Our meal ticket surprised me though. We ended up spending 35 dollars before tip on just two of us. And I wasn't drinking any cocktails. I guess I am not used to spending that much at a chain Restaurant when I could eat at so many good local restaurants. At the end he gave a two scratch tickets for some promotion and we won another free sandwich and a free coke after the 11th!  I guess I will be going there one more time. :) Good Job Red Robin in Nampa.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nampa?start=40
