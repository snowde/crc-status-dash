Suzanne A.,"Nashua, NH",93,3,,2.0,6/4/2017,Glad I got take out.  Drink didn't taste like there was a drop of alcohol in there.  Restroom out of toilet paper and waste basket overflowing.  Took pics.  Sending to corporate.  Honestly - I was revolted by the rest room.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashua-2?start=20
Bettie L.,"Waukegan, IL",27,34,5,1.0,12/17/2016,"Very disappointed by the food. Stopped by after work and was STARVING! The girls in the front were more concerned about keeping their gossip going than greeting me, I actually had to ask if they were open.  Placed a take out order and was told it would take 10-15 minutes which I thought meant my food was gonna be freshly made, came back after 10min and picked up my already packaged meal. The waitress was nice. When I was driving away I was kinda surprised by how I couldn't feel any warmth in the bag, opened it to find really old dry fries and burger, both lukewarm, I was already on my way home but I'm really disappointed by this location especially because Red Robin has always been great at my home location. I wish I had checked it before I left because I definitely would not have taken it! I see so many people have said the same things I have and nothing is done, do they have managers?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashua-2?start=20

Kerry B.,"Cambridge, MA",0,7,1,1.0,8/15/2016,"Terrible. It took over 45 minutes for our food to arrive. We were there with 2 young children. The orders were all wrong. I asked for my chicken sandwich to be in a wrap. They apparently took that to mean no bread? They served me chicken wrapped in lettuce. On a plate. When I questioned the waitress - she told me ""you ordered wrong. You should have said you wanted a spinach wrap when you ordered"". Ummm OK? Mindblowing that asking for a wrap = chicken & lettuce on a plate. Asked for sweet potato fries, they give regular. Everything took forever. It was just bad all around. Food is not good.

Samantha L.,"Potomac, MD",1912,1022,9453,3.0,1/20/2015,"Tonight, my parents and I had dinner at Red Robin - Nashua. We ordered  Stella Artois (draft) and Angry Orchard. My mom ordered the soup and salad combo. For the soup, she chose French Onion Soup which consisted of onion, cheese, bread in a beef broth - it was salty to the point it was not edible. For the salad, she chose Caesar salad which consisted of fresh romaine lettuce drenched in Caesar dressing and garnished with croutons. My dad ordered the Arctic Cod Fish and Chips with a bowl of French Onion Soup. The Fish and Chips was crispy and served with tar tar sauce. Since both of them weren't satisfied with the soup, we asked to switch them to New England Clam Chowder which was considerably better. It was thick, creamy, and rich like a chowder should be. I ordered a Sauteed Shroom Burger which consisted of beef patty, sauteed mushrooms, and swiss cheese on a garlic toasted sesame bun. I added onion straws to the burger, asked for campfire sauce on the side, and substituted the bottomless fries for sweet potato fries. The fries weren't fresh as they were room temperature. I think all Red Robin's should have a bottle of campfire sauce at the table for customers to use for their burgers and/or fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashua-2?start=20

We waited and waited for her to come back before asking another server if he could check on our drinks. he came back with them and we went back to the waiting game to order. honestly, we didn't see our waitress for anything, no refills, no food order. we had to bother the poor server again to take our food orders after 30 minutes of waiting.he took our order, refilled our drinks and was excellent but we never saw our waitress again until she walked by and dropped the bill off. No apology, no how was it, not a single word was said to us. I honestly have never left no tip before but I did it here. I found the other helpful server and gave him a 10 for his troubles.

Jenny C.,"Dayton, OH",82,227,258,2.0,12/19/2014,"Red Robin is located at the Pheasant Lane mall (although there's no way for you to enter the restaurant while still in the mall) by Dick's Sporting Goods and Target. Parking is generally plentiful- you'll be fighting mall patrons for the same spots. I've come here a few times since it's opened. I've come with a large group of girlfriends, I've come as one of two couples, etc. Service, like at most Red Robins, is hit or miss. The last time I was here, the waitress was extremely kind and very willing to accommodate my table. Currently as I'm writing this review in-house, our waitress is bare-minimum helpful- no more, no less. H and I had to chase her down to give us one ""bottomless fries."" The food (or its taste, I guess) is why I come to Red Robin. If I want a banzai burger, I know it'll taste like it did when I ordered it in Connecticut, New York or California. The only difference with this location is that oftentimes the food is lukewarm or semi-cold. Meh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashua-2?start=20

Bob L.,"Dracut, MA",0,47,4,3.0,9/3/2017,"I never been here and wanted to try it hearing the burgers were good. We arrived, had brief wait to be seated, about 5 minutes. The hostess was very polite and friendly as she got us seated. The server also greeted us promptly and friendly. My wife had the Red Robin Burger. My mom had a salad with balsamic dressing and I had the Bacon Cheeseburger. Burgers were cooked as ordered, salad was large and fresh looking. A little skimpy on the fries, but we knew the fries were ""bottomless"" so I guess no problem, right? Everyone enjoyed their meal, wife paired her burger with a Blue Moon, they have a large selection of beers. We ordered a take-out for my son and extra fries while we waited. The fries came out in a basket, at the bottom was about 8 fries for us to share, again a bit skimpy, so much for ""bottomless"""" fries, they should just give a good potion with the meal and stop trying to ration them out. The take-out arrived promptly. I had to pay with one of those standing card swipe / advertisement tablets that sit on you table. I do have to say the service was very good, the food was adequate, it's a burger joint and a chain restaurant so that is what to expect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashua-2?start=20
Russ S.,"Groton, MA",18,35,,1.0,10/17/2015,"Worst meal I've ever been served. Why doesn't yelp have an option for zero stars, as one star is far too generous. My wife ordered a cheeseburger done medium. When it came out it seemed pretty red though it was hard to tell since it was as dark as a cave in the place. When they turned up the lights you could see that her burger was so rare you could have slapped a bandaid on it and sent it back to the pasture. Plus you could have literally wrung out the grease from the bun. I ordered the Uber burger, which was a burger with a bratwurst on top. The bratwurst was black. Not dark grill marks.....black.  My onion rings were just a shade lighter than the bratwurst. Disgusting.  Oh, and the drinks, an ice tea and a rootbeer float were warm.  How a drink with ice cream in it can be warm is beyond me, but apparently the folks at Red Robin are better at bending the laws of thermodynamics than they are at preparing a simple meal. Add to this the incredibly loud NHL play by play and the lousy waitresses (two) that we had, and we surely won't be cashing in the ""two free burgers because we really hope you come back"" card that the manager handed us. Avoid this place like the plague, which is what I felt like I contracted based on the gutteral mutterings my stomach made the rest of the night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashua-2?start=20
Elizabeth B.,"Billerica, MA",15,21,5,5.0,6/24/2016,"I took the little girl I take care of here for lunch today. I could tell right away that we had a great waiter (Justin), he was very friendly. We order shakes and our lunches. Our shakes came right away and were perfect! Justin helped me choose the new smores shake and omg it was soooo good!! A little bit of time went by and Justin came over and told us he went and checked on our food and the girl who was carrying it dropped it so they were starting new ones. I could tell he thought I would be upset but I worked in kitchens long enough to understand sometimes this happens. He was extremely apologetic and was very appreciative that I wasn't upset. It didn't take long for our meals to come out and they were both excellent. I decided to let my little friend have dessert and she chose the mud pie. It was very good even though we barely ate a quarter of it. Justin told me our dessert was on the house to make up for dropping our lunch. I was blown away because of how amazing our waiter had been. I've been to some of the best restaurants in Ma, Nh, Ny, Ct, and Me and I have found that service like this is rare. All in all today we had a great lunch and we will be back soon!

M A.,"Tyngsborough, MA",0,92,,2.0,11/19/2015,"Last week i went in with two other people.I thought something different. First, we came in an was told it would 15-20 min wait, a little after 1 we were there.The front of the house doesnt really have a lot of room to wait per se.I felt bad for the hostess who had to stand near the door while the cold wind came in and out. Its pretty loud in there, the music would be appreciated a lot more if it was keep it at a min. got a table, one of the people wanted to move to the other end of the restaurant, so we did the table was clean and the person who takes you to your table, let someone else know that we switched .When we did, we sat there for a good 15 min and then finally i asked if our waitress was missing.Finally she greeted us and then we   careful because you cant substitute the sides for the substitutions and vice versa, tip: put them all in the same category.most people will pay the dollar or so more if they can have what they want. took quite a while for food.french fries were bland and cold, the waitress asked if we wanted fresh ones, we wanted fresh ones to begin with, but this has to do with the kitchen and not her. the onion rings sides consist of about 5 onion rings we got soaked for. overpriced.go to five guys instead.imho.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashua-2?start=60
Courtney N.,"Wakefield, MA",72,1075,22,4.0,4/28/2012,"I am so happy that we finally have a Red Robin in the area (and by my area I mean about an hour versus the long drive to Foxboro for the only other one that I've seen). I had no idea they were opening up at the Pheasant Lane Mall and had actually eaten the first time I saw them. I shook my fist and vowed to return, which my friend and I did less than a week later.  I've only been in Red Robin once and I foolishly ordered a roast beef sandwich instead of their famous burger. I did not make that mistake again! The burger was delicious. Probably the best one I've had at a chain restaurant. The portion was big and the price was great. I did not like the sweet potato fries. Somehow some regular ones were mixed in, and they tasted so much better. Next time, I'll have to go with the fries. My friend wanted melon (listed on the menu) but they don't serve that anymore. He ended up getting the only rice they offered which was extremely spicy. My other quibble is that they messed up my iced tea. I got one of the 10 calorie, unsweeted ones and it was great so I got a refill and they brought me a sickly sweet one just loaded with sugar and then never returned to check on us.  It was very busy in there. Packed with families and the wait to get seated for two was just under ten minutes. I think part of it was going on a Friday night so I'd be interested to see how it is on a random weeknight. As I said, great prices, friendly people and nice decorations make it a must stop if you're craving a burger!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashua-2?start=60
Martha P.,"Fitchburg, MA",3,3,,2.0,1/26/2014,"We were up shopping at the Pheasant Lane Mall, so we decided to try the Red Robin. Been seeing their commercials forever and thought  Why not. For an economy that supposedly isnt doing to good the place was packed. And I guess had been busy for a while. We were originally told that it would be a 15 minute wait, which was ok. After 15 minutes another person came over and informed all of us waiting that ""somehow the IPad they used for seating had erased all the names. A bunch of people left after that. We stayed figuring hey, not starving it's all good. Waited another 10 minutes and were seated by the kitchen. Not a big deal. Waitress came and took our drink order pretty fast. We also ordered an appetizer but were told that two of the items on the appetizer list were not available. Ok. Ordered the moz sticks. Which came out pretty quick. A bit later the waitress came back and we began to order our meals. One of our party wanted a chicken finger plate. At which time the waitress informed us there was no chicken.  Huh? Two items on the appetizer menu not avail and also no chicken? Who does the ordering for this place? After a quick go over of the menu a substitute was found and we ordered our meals. And waited. And waited. Two tables seated after us were served before us. Burgers. Just like we ordered. Another waitress came over to tell us our meals would be ""right out""  A few minutes later they were delivered. And they were  ""Meh"" at best. The fries were cold. Granted not ice box cold, luke warm. And the burgers were far from being hot as well. All and all not a great food experience. With the appetizer(which they were out of the two things we wanted) The two adult sodas and a milk shake. And the two burgers that were barely warm and a salad (that was ordered because they were out of chicken!) the total, w/o tip came to $48 and some change. WAY OVER PRICED for the very mediocre food and service. Will not go back again or recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashua-2?start=60
Henry P.,"Boston, MA",193,111,159,4.0,12/11/2011,"Definitely a fan of Red Robin! While craving food and drinks after a long day of work, my friend and I decided to check out the brand new Red Robin that just recently opened. Decor is bright, whimsy and very inviting, we sat at the bar and ordered a few beers, apps and burgers. Since we came at happy hour, the beer portions were HUGE and CHEAP at $2.50 a mug. We quickly started a tab as we sat down to watch the Bruins game. Their ""Tower Of Onion Rings"" is literally a gigantic stack of onion rings served sizzling, golden and crispy fried to perfection on top of one another. I was feeling adventurous and ordered their Spicy Burger ( its name eludes me currently ) and it came out sizzling hot, thick and juicy packed full of flavor. The best part of the meal was that the burgers were served with a endless stack of steak cut fries, MORE food for such a cheap price that I'm already paying? WHY NOT!?

Ian W.,"Pelham, NH",715,3717,5928,3.0,12/28/2011,"I like Red Robin! I've dined at other Red Robin locations with pretty good experiences including at the Latham, NY location, which I visit often with my buddy back in Upstate NY. The  food is usually solid good and consistent on each visit.  After shopping at the Pheasant Lane Mall, we decided to stop for lunch at the new Red Robin on the outside of the mall. I also needed to use up an old Red Robin gift card. The place was very crowded and extremely busy with a line out the door with a greeter in the doorway taking names using an electronic tablet, a 30-45 minute wait for a table. There were lots of folks waiting around in front to hear their name called. They were constantly calling out the many parties (your table is now available) before us over the PA system as we waited about 35 minutes for our name to be called out. Our waitress arrived shortly to take our order after we were seated at a 2-person booth near the kitchen. The kitchen staff was really cranking out the food with plenty of burgers, sandwiches, and appetizers piling up ready to be served. Many items such as the burgers and sandwiches are served on paper in baskets. The Towering Onion Rings looked very good! My friend ordered only an appetizer Triple S Riblets ($7.99) served in a basket with steak fries and BBQ riblets on the bone. The riblets were tender and chewy and a bit messy to eat with a sweet and smoky flavor. The golden steak fries were good and hot and salted. This was just the right amount of food for lunch.  I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Sandwich ($9.99), which was a fairly big sandwich with a grilled juicy boneless chicken breast basted with Whiskey River BBQ sauce, topped with cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and crispy onion straws on a soft bun. This sandwich was pretty good, but too big to eat by mouth. The bun had a crumbly texture though. The portion of steak fries underneath was small, but they offer bottomless steak fries, which I really enjoy! I asked the waitress for more steak fries, and five minutes later, a fresh basket of hot steak fries arrrived! Sweeet!!!  Our lunch was pretty good and filling and we passed on dessert. The service was decent, given the circumstances of the place being crazy busy. The refills on the drinks took a while to arrive since our waitress had several other tables and returned with several drinks on a tray serving a line of tables including ours in one pass. We would definitely return again to the Nashua Red Robin! (3.5/5.0 stars)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashua-2?start=60

We went at prime lunch time and were seated immediately.  Staff was friendly.  The place was clean, including the women's bathroom.  I ordered my daughter the corn dog meal, myself the French onion soup and the avocado cobb salad.  Oh, and a small stack of onion rings. Food came quickly, and the soup was great.  Loaded with onions, croutons, and cheese.  My daughter and I loved the onion rings.  The creamy BBQ sauce goes with them well.  My daughter had never had a corn dog before, so the novelty of the food on a stick seemed to go over well.  The salad was also very good, loaded with the toppings- and not quite as much lettuce, which would be the only complaint I had. This place is a burger joint, and I realized that not a burger was tasted while there.  For those who aren't in the mood for a burger, there is definitely enough to pick from outside of their signature menu items that are good.

A R.,"Nashua, NH",147,3,,1.0,5/27/2016,"On wednesday, May 25th, My friend, and I came in after a long shift at work (in the service industry), and when we walked in, the 2 women at the hostess station had their backs toward us, talking to the bartender. We stood there for a little over 5 minutes,  waiting to be acknowledged, and at one point,  all 3 woman (including the bartender) looked over at us, and just ignored us. We were about ready to either just sit wherever, or walk out,  when a different hostess came from the back (she was stocking balloons) and greeted us immediately. She dropped what she was doing to make sure we were seated, and she was super nice,  and very pleasant to speak with. I later saw one of the other woman who ignored us, seat a different couple. I believe these women were some sort of management because they were wearing regular shirts instead of red robin shirts, which was even more aggravating being in management at my own store. Justin was our server, and he was absolutely the best server I've ever had. If you are ever going to go to this location, request him, because if it wasn't for the fact that we were ignored hardcore, this review would have been amazing due to him, and the hostess who actually had time to seat us.

In Salem, it took forever to get our (2) hamburgers prepared and delivered.  We had nothing special ordered for condiments and it wasn't at all busy.  It seemed everyone from the waitresses down to the manager had an attitude. Sour faces when taking the order and a ""shrug it off"" attitude when we asked why the burgers were taking so long to be delivered. Some 40 minutes later, the burgers finally arrived.  I hate to see how long it takes when the restaurant is fully filled. We decided to try Red Robin again in Nashua; you guessed it...ten times worse.  Once again, the place wasn't busy at 3:00 PM. The chicken wing appetizers, after 25 minutes, never made it to our table.  The waitress said they would be up in a few minutes and suddenly, disappeared, then 10 minutes later, she hurried by and the chicken wings never arrived.  We went to shag the assistant manager who apologized profusely. He told us they burned the first batch but the next was on the way and that he wouldn't charge us for the wings.  Another 10 minutes go by and we get our salads and burgers with another apology that some other waitress picked up the chicken wings appetizer we ordered and gave it to her customers' by mistake.  The honcho general manager then came over and once again, apologized profusely. We were really ticked at this point and kept our cool, but told him he should cover the whole bill for the stinking service and the 45 minutes wait, which he did. There is no excuse for screwing chicken wings up, not once, but twice! While the free meal was appreciated, it doesn't cut it for routine piss poor service in (2) separate locations.  When waitresses don't read an order and don't get reprimanded for taking another customers' order, and the cooks in the kitchen get away with burning food and aren't fired for flirting with the waitresses, something is terribly amiss.  Hey... assistant manager and general manager, take authority there, do your damn job! Who runs this corporation? Don't you train employees about customer care and doing your job correctly the first time?  This corporation will certainly loose profits if they continue hiring bottom of the barrel employees. Fire the idiots who walk past customers as though they are invisible!   NO, we don't want to play your stupid trivia games! NO, we didn't come here to get drunk.  Stop pushing the alcohol and just get the order to the table!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashua-2?start=60

Justin was super-friendly, and came right over when my friend arrived, and his beer also appeared within a minute.  Food- really disappointing, even for a chain, crank 'em out place. We both ordered veggie burgers with diffferent toppings. The burgers themselves were micro'd, ad would have benefited from a minute or so on the grill top to give them a crisp. The toppings- ewww- ice cold. I totally get the concept of mis en place, however ice cold mushrooms and onion straws on a warm, mushy boca burger is just ewww. There must be a better way. I can wait a few minutes, if you can make my burger toppings warm when they should be warm. Fries- 1st round cold and unappealing, refill fries were nice and hot. This was my lovely free birthday burger, would have been nice if they had remembered to take it off the check without my having to remind them.

David H.,"Fort Worth, TX",17,36,21,1.0,4/3/2012,"You'd think that a place with the tag-line ""Gourmet Burgers"" would serve up decent burgers, right? I must have missed something because this is certainly not the case at Red Robin! You know how nice those fast food sandwiches look in the advertising, but if you are silly enough to order one they look as though they have been flattened by a truck? Same deal at Red Robin. I'd not been to this location although I seem to recall a lunch at another Red Robin in the past. Anyway, the Nashua store is a decent place and the staff OK (even though our waitress spoke so quickly I could only make out one word in about 10 - took me a while to decide she was actually speaking a version of English). The food looks great in the photos in the menu - yay, bring on the big burgers, I'm bloody starving. The illusion is shattered when the little flat package is delivered. The burgers are so thin it would be impossible to cook them the medium rare we ordered. Fries? I think I got about 6 - no-one said anything about free fries top-ups, although that might have been in the 9 words out of 10 we couldn't understand. I'd rate the burgers at about 50% as good as Fat - Oops sorry Five - Guys at quite a bit more cost (not that Fat Guys burgers are that great - just way better than here). We are pretty much in a burger wasteland in Nashua anyway - want a decent one? Best drive over to Owen & Ollie's in Dracut.

Upon going there again, we were waited on by this behemoth of a man who did his job adequately but far from my previous visit.  He was quite aloof about our presence.  The thing I liked about these chain restaurants is the fact that you have free refills on drinks but that only works IF THE WAITER IS THERE TO GET THEM FOR YOU!  He was nowhere to be found and I just think it's rude to ask other waiters who have their own diners to attend to.   Another reason I gave it four stars is because as I stated earlier, I ordered the Marinated Steak Tips and Chicken Tender Combo Plate and it was delicious.  I ordered the same thing again and it was not the same.  It was like the used up/past its prime cousin of that dish I had... it wasn't good at all.  Normally I would demote the place to 3 stars but my first visit really still lingers in my heart.  I'll give them a third chance and we'll see where it goes from there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashua-2?start=40

Each time the food is warm enough for you to enjoy your first bite. Good luck having more than three fries without them becoming cold. The burgers are smothered with their sauce and you don't get to actually enjoy the burger. Most of the staff is friendly and willing to help you. They have always asked if we wanted to sit in the bar section. It will save you at least 30 minutes of wait time, if you're going during busy times. However, service is extremely slow.

Chili was good but small. When asked how we wanted our burgers cooked we (literally) asked for hockey pucks. We're weird, yah, but it's a basic request. No pink! What comes out?  Blood soaked buns met with apologies. Sent them back and another 15 minutes later a manager comes out with fries and let us know it'd be a little bit for our burgers since the Angus was thick or something like that. People who were seated after us had already ordered, eaten, paid, and left at this point! When the burgers finally came out, cooked right, I noticed the fancy ketchup in a bowl was missing. Oh well. Reached for the bottle on the table... and it was empty. I ate the burger dry as I didn't feel like waiting even longer to eat.

It was actually the first time for 7 of the 9 guests at Red Robin's and they were rather disappointed, with the service especially.. My boyfriend and I ordered appetizers and we did not receive any plates to eat our food on so over the table (and without napkins) it was. My boyfriend also ordered a shake which dripped a little bit on the table and that wasn't cleaned by our waitress nor did she offer so my boyfriend had to eat the appetizers over the table, the dirty table. Food had arrived so we were all excited.  Sucks that the burger I was amping my best friend who came with us to get, was completely off (may I remind you again, his first time). My boyfriend and I also ordered the same burger and all three tasted not like how it usually does.  There was absolutely no sweetness or candied bacon in our southern charm burger... My cousin's prime rib entrée was way too salty for him.  I actually love salty food but even that was too salty for me. So we sent that back. Does anyone wanna send any food back on their first visit? Yeaaaaaah. My boyfriend had ordered sweet potato fries with his burger.  He received regular fries which is fine as he thought he could just easily ask our waitress for the fries he ordered.  Maybe the waitress didn't feel like grabbing them after my boyfriend asking her twice for his sweet potato fries or she wasn't attentive, I don't know.  Either way, my boyfriend (who actually isn't picky or needy when it comes to food) actually said to me that if he had to ask for his fries one more time, no tip will be given due to the carelessness and inattentive waitress.  I was honestly surprised that he even gave the 3 bucks he did. I think the best part of our meal was when the waitress brought out our bill  1. before we asked for it . 2. before we finished eating our food. 3. a lot quicker than serving us, her customers.

Spenser O.,"Eugene, OR",8,100,,1.0,12/28/2011,"Now don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Red Robin, I've been to several locations throughout the northeast, but this one, this one, just stands out like necrosis on a pale white knee.  I dined at this location along with the rest of my party two days before the madness, commonly known as ""the holidays"" began.  Since this location is essentially part of the Pheasant Lane Mall, one of the largest malls in NH, and one of the few tax free states in America, we figured it would be a relatively long wait, but when we were seated right away, maybe that should have been the signal to eat elsewhere.    We were seated by this nice, younger looking waitress (although looks can be deceiving.) Drinks were a cinch to order, but after that she disappeared. Finally returning, we placed orders for the main course, I got what I always get, the bacon cheeseburger, no lettuce or tomato. The two things I didn't request somehow ended up on the burger.  So my order was messed up. But it wasn't just me, almost everybody at the tables order was messed up in someway too,  ranging from stuff we didn't request to things literally being served cold.  And or course, again, our waitress disappeared, and this time, for good.  Having to flag down another waiter for some other person's fault always makes me feel weird but I did it anyway.   So then comes the manger.  She was actually very nice and took the three items that were messed up off the bill (Now mind you, three items messed up when you are a party of say 30 might be understandable, but when five people ordered and three are messed up...you know where I am heading.)  Finally, our waitress turns up again, saying the reason that she was gone for so long was because she spilled some strawberries/cherries or whatever and she was double seated.  ...She was double seated. My head nearly exploded at that line.  If you can't handle taking two or three peoples orders than you should not, I repeat, SHOULD NOT BE WORKING IN THE RESTAURANT BUISNESS, especially during the HOLIDAYS.  I could go on a long and very factual tirade about service here but in the interest of reviewing I will save that for my own time.  She gave us the check. She got a crummy tip in return (good thing I wasn't paying because if I was she wouldn't have goten a tip.)    I think there is a Chick-fil-a in the mall, go there instead for a quality meal.

I mean when you consider the amount of people they serve. The restaurant is located at the Pheasant Lane Mall so this place is almost always busy!

My wife and I had stopped in after some shopping. It was kind of a weird experience to be honest. They told us the wait would be 25 minutes and it ended up being 15 (good start). We were seated and after about 10 minutes, still no server (bad follow-up). Finally a waitress (possibly a mgr) who'd observed us looking around like abandoned ducklings came over. When she realized we we'd been deserted she offered us a free appetizer (good move). We ordered our meal and it took forever to come out (they weren't even that busy) and my burger had about 5 french fries with it. At this point we'd had a new waitress assigned to our table and she was very nice, she brought me a ton of fries (nice recovery). The burgers and fries were pretty good. We noticed that we were not the only table that was subject to painfully long waits, which tells me that there was a systemic issue. I'm not sure if we caught them on a bad night or if they are like this all the time. I'll definitely give them another shot as their burgers are pretty good. However, for a $10 burger and an overpriced $5 shake, I expect better service. Get it together Robin!!!! If you're thinking about stopping in, I'd say go ahead...

Hopefully with time they will work this out. They have a full bar, but I have yet to have anything from it. I have ended up with a frappe every time as they do a very good job making them. I skip the appetizers as the burgers are pretty filling and they offer bottomless fries with all the orders. I really like the mini burger option.  It is a smaller version of the regular burger that is not listed on the menu for some reason.

The burger, as a whole, is a huge object - the actual patty is quite thin (though cooked to perfection, I have to add.) You are getting 80% toppings/bun, 20% burger - if that. & maybe some of you don't want a giant piece of hamburger, but I do. All the ingredients are pretty fresh (lettuces, tomatos, etc.), & the seasonings are noticeable & tasty, but the burgers are just lacking something. I feel like they rely on toppings, sauces, & seasonings to pump up the taste that the meat itself should be providing. The nitpick-y: The caramelized onions - not caramelized. The bun - not toasted (though I probably could have asked for this.) The fries - never the sweet potato ones I specifically ask for. No, really, every time I've ordered here, they don't give me sweet potato fries, but you can bet they charge me for them anyway! I have no complaints about service, except for being put on hold indefinitely when I called in my order - the girl who originally answered definitely forgot about me, but whomever picked up a couple of minutes later was helpful.

Other than that its a great place to bring the family or even to go with friends. I have worked in the mall for six years and I would say this is one of the best places to eat that has a fun atmosphere in the area.

Especially when those other people are teenage boys that just want to be allowed out in public and eat unlimited baskets of fries. The waitstaff was incredibly attentive, though that may have been because two of the boys I brought looked like they might start a riot if they didn't eat quickly (and they might have, to be fair). We were never without drink refills, and our waiter even dropped off a complimentary basket of fries to appease the beasts. I do wish he'd said something before loading these kids with caffeine on me, though, he was just too quick with the drop-offs! When our food arrived, my order was the only one that was correct. To be fair, each order had something missing or changed from the menu, but he did write these things down and they still came back with veggies/toppings we'd asked not to include, or cooked too little or too much for our specifications. I did appreciate that they serve burgers protein-style (no bun, wrapped in lettuce instead), and perhaps that brought attention to my order and is the reason it was done correctly. Lucky for them, the boys were in a forgiving mood and too hungry to care about the lettuce or tomatoes or wrong kind of cheese. They stuffed their faces and moved on, but it easily could have turned into a disaster. I ordered sweet potato fries that were pretty overcooked, and the boys all had mac & cheese that they told me ""wasn't the most exciting."" My burger tasted delicious though, and they devoured theirs so it must not have been awful. I've been to this location a few times, and the food's been fine, service acceptable.

Helen M.,"Hooksett, NH",1,44,,2.0,7/1/2012,"Red robin has nostalgia written all over it. My mom has fond memories of going here when she was younger down south so I had to eventually make it over.  My date and I ordered the tower of onion rings which came with 2 dipping sauces, he ordered the crispy chicken ""burger"" and I had the mushroom burger. First the good. The onion rings were delish. Crispy and greasy with soft onion running throughout. The sauces that came with them were standard, ranch and a fancy BBQ. My date said the chicken burger was pretty good, it came with lettuce tomato and those bottomless fries. My burger was huge with tons of toppings on it. Service was quick and didn't bother us much besides to refill our drinks and to drop off the bill, which I preferred. Now the bad. Although my burger was huge I wasn't all the impressed. I asked for some pink and it came out basically raw after the first bite. More rare when I prefer medium rare. The burger itself didn't have much flavor and I was disappointed that the burger didn't come with any lettuce tomato or pickles, just a huge pile of shrooms.  The seating was awful. We got the worst seat in the place I think, a tiny booth right across from the kitchen. I wouldn't have minded if the place was packed but there were plenty of other tables open. I considered asking to be moved but decided to not be too much trouble. I should have though because being so close to the open kitchen, my date and I had full view of the servers and cooks calling each other names and throwing insults around. I've worked in kitchens so I know what goes on, but there's nothing like biting into your burger to the lovely sound of the cooks called each other dick-wads lol. Our server however was very nice and we watched her work her butt off the whole time; I wish I'd gotten her name. Overall I wasn't expecting fine dining so I wasn't surprised when I didn't get it. I might try them again if I was in the area and in the mood for a greasy burger, but it's not something that I'm going to seek out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashua-2?start=100
Doug L.,"Nashua, NH",0,1,,4.0,4/21/2014,"My visit at Red Robin was genuinely surprising.  I had never been to a Red Robin before, so this was my first time.  I had the bacon cheeseburger with an appetizer of the onion rings.  I have to say, the onion rings were fantastic!  The burger was in the middle quality wise, but it still satisfied my burger needs.  The decor was more centered around kids, but it wasn't ""dumpy"" by any stretch.  I will definitely return at some point in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashua-2?start=100

Mel S.,"Gardner, MA",0,62,,3.0,11/20/2012,"I stopped in with my mom before heading out on a shopping trip.  It was my first time in a Red Robin, and honestly it was exactly what I expected as an ex-customer of Applebee's and a previous customer of TGI Fridays, Chili's, etc: nothing special in a typical atmosphere.  Since I expected that, I wasn't turned off by its generic menu and scene. Pros: * The employees seemed nice enough.  We were sat almost immediately after walking through the doors. * The kitchen manager visited our table shortly, yet not immediately, after our food was delivered to ask how we were doing.  I don't know which restaurant started that fad, but I love it. * The food was good.  I'm a vegetarian with a weak stomach, so my options are usually limited.  I ordered the chips with guacamole and salsa along with a side salad.  My mom ordered one of their burgers (wish I could remember which one - it had pineapple and jalapenos on it) and she loved it.  The steak fries are delicious and BOTTOMLESS. Cons: * Though seated quickly, we were not approached by anybody to take our drink order for quite awhile.  The restaurant was not very busy and they had at least 4-5 waitstaff working. * The tea, unlike coffee, is not bottomless.  The waitress explained it had to do with inventory, but this has to be the first restaurant I've been to in years that charges for each tea bag used.  As a heavy tea drinker, and winter creeping up on us, this was highly disappointing. * We weren't provided with silverware and had to ask for it after our meal was served.   When it was finally brought over, it was dropped on our table by our waitress as she passed to go to the next table because they were about to do their ""happy birthday"" bit for someone.  I personally felt as though we were being a burden to her at that point. * The dressing for my salad didn't come out with the salad, and we had to ask another waitress to bring it over. All in all I might go back to give the place another go, but it won't be any time soon.  It's not a place I'd recommend unless it was to someone who loves burgers since my mom seemed to really love what she ordered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashua-2?start=100
Brian N.,"Hudson, NH",1,6,1,3.0,6/26/2012,"Been here several times, but it's been a very mixed bag for me. The burgers are just ok in my opinion. Service has been ok as well.

They changed their patty to a half Boca patty. It's definitely not as good as their original burger. Our waitress was extremely nice and said if we didn't like the burger she'd replace it at no cost.

Dominic J.,"West Newbury, MA",55,3,,5.0,9/25/2017,Honestly I always thought this place was a typical run of the mill chain restaurant but boy was I wrong. I went there with my girl and her 18 month yr old the staff was good with her (you know how kids get) and there weren't any issues there it seems very family friendly.  Now onto the food...i haven't had a good burger in a while and this place blew me away! I had the Banzai burger it has pineapple and a delicious teriyaki sauce on it. The combination was soooo good and they cooked it to perfection. One of the best burgers I've had in a long time. Lucky for the restaurant I wasn't super hungry because much to my surprise they offer bottomless fries! These are good steak fries too not some little string fry.

Lori D.,"Pepperell, MA",14,30,39,4.0,4/8/2017,"Having read other reviews here, I have to wonder when some of these visits were from a timing perspective.  If you choose to eat out in this particular area (malls, shopping...) during peak weekend and shopping and errand times, you will almost never have a great dining experience along with all the other thousands of people trying to do the same thing. Simply put, the volume of hungry customers far exceeds the number of seats available to feed all the hungry hoards tearing down the doors for a seat. Now we add people waiting and watching those who are eating. And hoping they will eat fast so they will pay and leave so we can be seated to be fed.   A perfect storm for taxed out restaurants and crew and hungry shopper warriors. Then there are those who go super late when the place is going to close down in less than an hour and the crew is cleaning up for the day, and in gear down mode....not fire up the stove for more food prep. Not making excuses, just looking at this realistically. When you go plays a big role in what your experience will be. We went today, Saturday, late afternoon at around 3 pm. The tween time. Some tables had people, some were empty. Service was very good. Food was hot and prepared as we expected. Good quality angus cheeseburgers with bacon. Sweet potato fries, chili cheese fries - both were good.  No, this was not Flemings steakhouse. It's a burger place. It was neat and tidy inside. We will go back. And we will go when we know the timing of our visit, like today, will be in our favor for the best experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashua-2

Sreytha R.,"The Acre, Lowell, MA",23,8,,2.0,1/8/2018,"I have been wondering about this burger joint since it was  open as compared to others and I found that it was not as great as it appears to be.  Let's first start with the appetizers, my friends and I ordered several different ones ranging from fried pickles to their nachos.  The fried pickles were fried to long that the batter was slightly burnt and the portion size was ridiculously small ( I think we got like 10 pieces of quarter size pickles).  The nachosOMG, came out so cold that the cheese was not even melted !!! We had to sent it back and the second time it came the pieces of the nachos were burnt.  The gourmet burgers that it claims to offers were not tasty and the best thing about the burgers was the bun.  He meat was dry and tasteless.  We order some of the sauces for the fries but did not receive it, even after asking for it twice.  When it comes to the milkshakes, it was mostly filled with whip creams versus the actual shakes itself.  I would not recommend this place because I think it is way overpriced for the types of food it has to offer. Fuddruckers and even five guys would be a much better place to have a burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashua-2
Cindy R.,"Littleton, MA",29,119,97,4.0,12/19/2017,"Solid burger joint. Had lunch at the Nashua Red Robin yesterday with my sisters. We started by splitting the short tower of onion rings, with six onion rings--perfect size for three people. Just enough for a tasty bite but not too much to impact lunch. For lunch one sis and I ordered off the lite lunch page in the menu, and had the lettuce ""bun"" burger. This is an excellent option when you don't want the extra calories and carbs of a bun. The burger is served in a foil wrap so it does not get too messy while eating it. My other sister had the veggie burger and was very complimentary about it, in fact we chose Red Robin because this sister is a fan of their veggie burger. She paired her sandwich with garlic fries. My other sister and I swapped out the fries for cole slaw. Red Robin offers several side options if you're not inclined to French fries: steamed broccoli, cole slaw, small salad, etc. Red Robin is a good choice if you're watching what you eat. Our waitress was excellent: very friendly and efficient, a real pro.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashua-2
Tricia B.,"Tyngsboro, MA",8,253,304,1.0,8/27/2016,Here is my newest update. My friend wanted to go since we were in the mall.  We placed our order. It wasn't busy. I was feeling pretty good.  My friend made it very clear that she has allergies. Some severe. She ordered a chicken sandwich on a bun completely plain. It arrives with this huge gob of something still into the chicken. She is nervous about what it might be and bring it to the waitresses attention who walks away with it. She brings the same sandwich back minus the gob and says that the guys in the kitchen were using the spatulas to roast marshmallows and it must have just been from the spatula. Then using her fingers picks up the bun AND the chicken to show that she scraped it off.  WHAT THE HELL!!!!! There are so many things wrong with what happened here.

She was super nice and was trying her best and I appreciated that but I think management needs to consider having more than one server scheduled.  The food was ok. Just ok.
