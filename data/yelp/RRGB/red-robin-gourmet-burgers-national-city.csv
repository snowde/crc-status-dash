George M.,"Escondido, CA",0,28,14,5.0,3/13/2017,"Consistency, quality and personablity describe this Red Robin. The staff here is vetted by management, trust me I've been coming to this one for years, the staff that doesn't have the manners, courtesy, etc... are often short lived here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=80
Rochelle Anne C.,"National City, CA",1,7,17,5.0,8/4/2017,"Me and my bf first time eating here and it was a nice customer service no wonder they always have a lot of people coming and coming ,we also got a small fries for free. Our servers name is Dalia she's very nice and shes good at customers and i love it",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=80
Iris D.,"Escondido, CA",28,17,17,3.0,8/23/2015,"Ate there today... was excited that they  have this tablet that you can order youself and pay on the device... we tried the verry berry drink and oreo shake, that was good :) then our food came we ordered blue ribbon burger, medium rare. Meat was burnt at the bottom :( you can taste the bitterness of it, so that was not good. Waiting for our water and drinks to get refilled but we needed to get their attention before we got our refill. Then time to pay.... so we were excited to use the tablet but after swipping the card it said our check can't be processed right now. We tried it 3x still no go. We asked help with our server but still didnt work so we end up just paying the regular way. Food wasnt that bad just the burnt part... usually we dont get that but service was a little slow for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=80
Grace L.,"San Diego, CA",207,321,114,1.0,10/3/2015,"I've been coming to red robin for over ten years and this is the first time the server was trying to charge $1.99 for fries to start off with. Guess it's not really bottomless anymore. There are many times I order their onion rings, burgers, salads, freckled lemonade, dessert, among other things that I was just craving some fries as a starter. So I was taken back when she told me of this cost. Goes against their advertising, I think. But anyway.. My current favorite salad is their fiesta salad. Their A1 peppercorn burger is also good. The fire burger is okay.  Their smoke and pepper tastes the best there.  Their wraps are disgusting.  Freckled lemonade is a must.  Milkshakes are always a win.  Onion rings are to die for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=80
Hector B.,"Chula Vista, CA",4,10,9,4.0,8/15/2016,"Great food, decent prices, i really like how they offer lettuce instead of buns for burgers.  Their beer selection is limited,  didnt hear of any ""happy hour"" specials but overall a cool spot, i would definitely go again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=80
Allyn D.,"Chula Vista, CA",60,20,29,3.0,8/3/2016,I would have to say they are my favorite when it comes to burger and desserts. I also tried the soups and I would not recommend it. The chicken Tortilla and clam chowder is way too thick and does not taste as good! I do like the red sangria  The servers are very pleasant and attentive and i did not have to wait for my order very long.  I would definitely come back here but not for the soup. MY Son loves the games that they offer although you have to pay 1.99 and unlimited use until you pay your bill then it will also stop the game :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=80
Magdalena L.,"San Diego, CA",6,54,,4.0,1/1/2017,"Service and food has improved since I wrote the original review.  We have an outstanding service while manager Rene is on duty, but not as good when he is not around.  We love their burgers and fries and hope that they continue to improve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=80
Britt W.,"Lemon Grove, CA",5,26,19,3.0,5/12/2016,Been here multiple times and the only thing really worth getting is the tavern double with fries and the onion rings. The 3 gourmet burgers I've tried really had no taste unless you smothered it with bbq sauce.  Today we had Melissa as a waitress and she was super pleasant. Definitely the best customer service we've ever had at this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=80
Jenn D.,"San Diego, CA",0,12,1,3.0,2/17/2017,"We checked in and we were told that there was going to be a 30 minute estimate wait so we decided to go look at the stores. We got a message saying our approximate wait , so all we needed to do was wait for the message alerting us that our table was ready. 30 minutes passed and we never got a text message so we decided to go back regardless. Once we got there, the lady in the front asked for our name and we told her we never got the text. So she put this face saying ""sorry we removed your name because you took to long."" We mentioned how we never got a text message so she said ""oh well you should've gotten one."" Well we didn't, we had to wait a couple more minutes to get seated. We were highly disappointed. Food was great so this gets a three star. Plus good customer service by the waitress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=80
Tommy H.,"Carlsbad, CA",5,13,7,4.0,2/5/2017,"We have not been to a Red Robin in quite awhile. This one has moved the bar up on what we had expected. Maintains the somewhat garrish Red Robin color combination and the service was good and food was creative - especially the beverage menu for beers and cocktails. We had a nicely done set of burgers (you can create). If you are willing to give corporate restaurants a fair chance, this one is worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=80
Amy C.,"National City, CA",0,22,3,5.0,7/22/2017,We made a reservation for 11 to celebrate my mom's birthday. Our server Sammie made this experience a very pleasant one and everyone in our party was very content with her service. Sammie made sure at all times that we had our drinks filled and was very friendly. The food was great as well. My mom requested her food cooked a little more crisp as she likes and Sammie was very helpful and took the food back without making faces. Very great experience!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=80
Jordan M.,"National City, CA",0,5,1,5.0,4/4/2016,"The burgers here are just too good to pass up, and you can't go wrong with bottomless fries and their house dip. The Southern Charm Burger is sooo good! My favorite. Close second is the Whiskey River BBQ wrap. They also have a lot of beer and alcohol options. Red Robin Royalty members get a free burger during their birthday month!  Whenever we go, we usually try to ask for Mymy to be our server. She's very attentive and helpful, and honestly makes the experience a lot more easy and fun! All of her recommendations have been delicious!! Really appreciate her customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=80

Paul S.,"Spring Valley, CA",128,414,2841,2.0,1/13/2016,"On this visit, we were meeting friends from out of town. My friend was visiting family in the South Bay Area and after wanted to see my wife and I for the new year in a casual setting. I have been to other Red Robin's before. The one in La Jolla and the other in Temecula. Both locations were pretty good in food and service. So at first I thought it was a great idea. Good food. Not too expensive. Quick bite to eat.....well, I was right on only one out of three.  The service was real slow. We were visited by different servers at different times but the time between visits were long. We even waited longer for our food. Total time dining was two and half hours. The only reason we stuck around was we haven't seen our friends in a while. They were also leaving San Diego after our meal.  The food was 'meh'. Even waiting for so long and starving. You would think they would serve me dog food and I would say that this was the best food ever. I didn't get that. Just disappointment. I left underwhelmed and no 'Yum'. Never going there again. This Red Robin is a pass.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=80
Conrad R.,"San Diego, CA",1355,727,15270,3.0,12/27/2014,"Red Robin...ummmm? Service was great, but the food was terribly underwhelming.  Stopped here because we were already at teh mall and wanted to squeeze every last minute of that sweet sweet rockstar parking spot that I swooped on this afternoon of Christmas week. It was either RR or Appledeez since we didn't want to deal with the holiday mob scene at the food court. Mi-Mi did a great job with customer service this evening. Food orders were taken quickly (plus delivered accurately), drinks were refilled often, and she checked on us regularly to make sure all was going well. Unless the food is complete disaster, I'm not one to send anything back. I've seen the movie Waiting. ""Don't f**k with people that handle your food."" -Monty Dinner plates. More misses than hits tonight. I'm glad the apps we shared are available as half orders.  -Chicken wings and chips. A half order is four pieces served over a bed of crunchy, crinkle cut potato chips. The buffalo sauce is mildly spicy with not much lingering heat. The BBQ sauce is sweeter in comparison and neither overly piquant nor smoky. What mostly grossed me out was how undercooked and fatty the birds bits were. I would've preferred a crispier exterior and cooked through for longer. -o' ring shorty. Their mini tower of 5 onion rings. Dat familiar crispy goodness perfectly uniform from the freezer and fried just right to my table. I actually like RR's rings because they are reliable at every location. -bacon cheeseburger. I added a fried egg just because. I'm glad I did because the bacon was thin, fatty and rubbery like it was microwaved. -bottomless fries. Not great this time. Mostly cold and soggy potato planks. Not even their magical seasoned salt could revive them. Other than the onion rings, the food was subpar and the service shined as tonight's saving grace. We don't frequent this location often, but compared to other RR joints, either the quality has diminished and/or the someone needs help in the kitchen. Unless we run out of nearby options we're not going to be rushing back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=80
Jesse S.,"Vancouver, WA",3,41,4,5.0,5/7/2016,"I decided to come here for my birthday because I'm signed up for the royalty program that comes with a free burger. I ended up sitting at the bar where the server was very polite and fast. He immediately asked if I wanted anything to drink and provided a menu. I ordered a lemonade and a royal red robin burger, (the one with the egg on top). The bartender was quick with refills and was very helpful. The burger itself was very well done and juicy. I chose garlic fries, which were delicious.  I would highly recommend coming here.

Grace L.,"San Diego, CA",1142,621,560,1.0,11/25/2014,"We had a choice to come here and El Torito and we chose to eat here.  Big mistake. Not only did they forget my garlic fries, but for 99 cents extra, what were supposed to be my garlic fries were pitifully covered in garlic salt and shredded parmesan and heated under a heat lamp. So sad. They also forgot to give me lemon with my fish and chips. Service felt cold as were my fries.

Rachel D.,"National City, CA",117,95,241,2.0,1/4/2016,"This Red Robin is alright. I've been here a few times since my aunt likes their food. The food is average to me and the service is sometimes a bit shakey. Once when we came here though there was a hair in my sisters salad. They changed it out and apologized but I kind of thought they would give us a free dessert or maybe a discount since my sis had to wait for a new salad but they didn't offer. Which they don't have to just thought it would be a nice courtesy. During that visit I also tried the garlic fries because I'm an avid fan of garlic fries but they didn't have the taste I was expecting. Guess I thought there would be more of a fresh garlic flavor, but it was more like a garlic powder flavor.  During my most recent visit yesterday although the staff was nice, the service wasn't great. I ordered a burger with onion but they never put the onions in. I had to ask for it. Then I ordered an onion ring appetizer which didnt come. When my entrees came out and still no onion rings I asked the waitress. We didnt get the onion rings til the end of our meal, by then I was actually about to cancel them until they were dropped of to the table. Maybe they regulate the onions back there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=80
Yesenia L.,"San Diego, CA",24,65,387,5.0,3/17/2016,"Bottomless drinks and fries, and good service. A little pricey depending on what you get, but good food. I had the about-Cobb-o salad. SOO GOOD!

Kiki Philomeen C.,"Imperial Beach, CA",0,14,19,3.0,4/25/2017,"We had a keto friendly burger (takeaway) , called fat pig burger or something. The Cole slaw was nice and spicey with mustard seeds.

Jose A.,"Mid-City, San Diego, CA",0,2,1,5.0,7/10/2017,"The Burning Love burger is by far the best burger I've ever had!!!

Jerry H.,"Chula Vista, CA",2,7,5,4.0,12/19/2016,Bee's knees waffle chicken burger was delicious. Garlic fries really good. Wait time was the only thing. Had to wait 22 minutes. And fry portion could be bit more.  Jheeze hook it up with the fries. And don't count on the machine at the edge of the table.

Michelle H.,"Spring Valley, San Diego, CA",19,5,,1.0,8/27/2016,"My family and I ate here this afternoon. The front of the house service was very slow. We knew we were attending during a peak time in the afternoon, but there were only a few sections open (poor planning house manager). The 15 minute wait we were told about became more like 35 minutes.  The food was a disappointment. The burgers were not cooked to our liking, the fries were cold, and everything was overpriced and not as good as we remembered.  My suggestion: have more staff scheduled before 3:00.

Samuel D.,"San Diego, CA",100,291,1419,4.0,5/12/2015,I've been to various Red Robin establishments and thus far no complaints. Atmosphere: this location is right in the mall of plaza bonita. Clean high ceiling restaurants with a full bar and tv's Food: ordered the double tavern cheeseburger comes with bottomless fries. the burger was cooked about a medium rare. it was a good classic burger that wasn't too heavy.  drinks: full bar and various cocktails mixes. ordered freckled lemonade(no alcoholic) unlimited refills.  Service: good friendly service from James the bartender.  Parking: can be hard to find because of the restaurant being next to Crunch gym.  I'd come back for the bottomless fries and freckled lemonade(no alcoholic) and of course their burgers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=60
Jenna H.,"Chula Vista, CA",817,295,1232,4.0,1/15/2016,"Located right next to the fitness center Crunch, and outside of the food court. The longest we've waited for the table was 15minutes, not bad for a busy restaurant on the wkends. Our favorite drink is freckled strawberry lemonade, it comes in a cool looking glass cup. I'll prob get diabetes hahaha...I also love their unlimited french fries, it's always fresh. Yum. My all time favorite burger from Red Robin is their regular cheese burger, buffalo wings & onion rings. Tastes amazing but I always feel guilty after eating them haha.  Service was never a problem for me when I come here. Every waiter & waitresses that served us was all nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=60
Elvy T.,"San Diego, CA",1,31,29,5.0,10/5/2017,"If you have kids this place is awesome. It's in the mall and I usually don't come to Plaza Bonita but we are having our truck serviced so they offered to drop us off here to wait instead of the dealership.  So happy we decided to pop in here for lunch. Zoey is pretty good in restaurants, but Red robin makes it easy to enjoy and finish a meal without a tummy ache later (you know because you're shoving food down so fast before the kids start screaming).  So hostess was very friendly and made room for the super wide mall stroller we were using right by our table so we wouldn't get it stolen.  and you want Miss Sammy as your server. She is so sweet. First time here and she is just so friendly and the absolute perfect server. Attentive but not too attentive. She had us covered, but we still were able to enjoy our meal. The food. So amazing. Try the chipotle dipping sauce. You will not regret it. I love the bottomless fries even though I absolutely don't need it but yes, I love sharing a few of them with Zoey so that I can order her a cup of fruit with her meal. All in all great experience.  I love how you have the option to pay at the table. The server drops the check, but if you pay with a card you can take care of it right away. No waiting around to get a card back and sign. What they are doing here is very efficient. I love it.  I think every place should be doing that. If they had a charging station I don't think I'd ever leave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=60

Tishana P.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,1,1.0,9/5/2017,One of the worst experiences I had at this restaurant. My boyfriend and I went for lunch and when we got there we were sat down with menus and told about the appetizers. We didnt get no napkins nor utensils the server didn't care and the manager sat looking around while we waited 20-30 min for our food. When I got my food my bun was as hard as toast and patty was cold. I had to wait on the server to come back and ask for my food cooked fresh. She brought my newer food out but it didn't seem fresh but at the end of our visit she wanted a tip.

Adriana Z.,"Poway, CA",795,61,969,5.0,10/22/2015,"The Service: Upon walking in we were quickly greeted by the hottest. She was friendly but didn't really make eye contact, I found that a little strange. But she was young so.. So, no worries. She seated us and smiled and that's perfectly fine!  Our waitress, Mayra V (I guess there are two Mayras that work there?) was all smiles and very informative. She taught us how to use the electronic table menu and even helped us join the rewards program. She had quiet a few tables going but we never felt like she wasn't on top of things! She was great about keeping of drinks filled and clearing in wanted dishes. I'll be asking for her every time we come in! The Food: Sometimes I forget how great the food is here!  We ordered the Mushroom Chibata Burger, The Bdg Chibata Burger, the Chicken Nuggets, and the mini pretzels appetizer. Everyone enjoyed their food. I LOVED MY BDG BURGER. It was juicy and so flavorful. I also really enjoy their onion rings.  The Atmosphere: It was the typical Red Robin Restaurant. It was red, cute, and clean. The bathrooms were clean. The only thing I found off putting about my visit there was a gentleman server, at least he might have been. He was clearing dishes and walking in and out of the restaurants kitchen and back room in a black sleeveless tank top. Weird right? Like he might drop some sweat or armpit hair around. It was just off putting.  The overview: Hostess was nice Mayra V was fantastic, had she not been our server I might not be back due to sleeveless guy.  My burger was BOMB Black tank top guy needs to put a shirt on, I don't care how buff your arms are!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=60

Patricis M.,"San Diego, CA",0,42,39,4.0,11/5/2016,Well then...  After celebrating 70 years of Spartan Pride and Homecoming the class of 78 CVHS decided to swing by the Bonita Red Robin. For burgers and cocktails. We were assigned Sammy.  When we found out she was 2 weeks into employ we thought that serving 10 fired up Spartans with high expectations would break her.... but no! She hung with the big dogs and came out shinning. Only one plate came out incorrect from the kitchen. She smartly gave the choice of keeping the plate but attentively was on the ready to replace... We were well taken care of and.... How happy am I that they had Belching Beaver on tap and 3 menu items at $6.99. I can say it won't take us as long to go back and Sammy is a keeper. Very personable. Our Friday night would have been a 5 star had the kitchen had put the onions on the side and gotten all the orders correct.  Good for you Bonita Plaza Red Robin. Did I mention I went over to the bartender to thank her for having BB peanut butter beer. Yay!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=60
Andy M.,"Chula Vista, CA",414,211,740,3.0,7/27/2015,"This is the perfect example of how a place can have great food but if they lack in customer service there reviews & ratings will suffer for it. The food here is great, I love the burgers here for the most part there all good I've tried a few, the one with the fried egg is my fav. The fries here are on point & the best part they have bottomless fries here which is awesome. There chips with the chipotle sauce is a very good appetizer as you wait for you're food & trust me you will wait for you're food. The kid options & shakes are good as well. The food always comes fresh & tasting good. Some of the best burgers I've eaten have been here. Yes I love the food here, so why don't I come here more often? Well the service is SLOW & SAD! Every time I've come here the wait is long & never really that busy so I don't get it. And you know what the wait isn't even the real problem here. I don't mind waiting a bit for good food as long as the service is good. Now don't get me wrong the service ain't bad but it ain't good either. Considering that they know the food takes awhile (cuz a lot of people complain about that here) you figure they be more on point.  For example the couple times we are there we had to wait awhile & as we did we finish our drinks & no one would come & check on us ever! We had to flag our waitress down & call them over cuz every-time they walked by us it's like they knew we needed something & they rush by us & not make eye contact with us, they did this with customers as well. We have waited 30 min with no refills & no food & no one asking us if we want more chips or apologies, that's unacceptable! We're not the only ones I've actually seen customers ask to speak to the manger, which I don't do cuz I try not to have tension with my waiter I want to eat peacefully but it's hard not to sometimes. The waitress here are not mean or rude but there not nice or friendly either there just like Blah. Some of them don't even look like they want to be working there, there just there to get a little check & pay there iPhone bill. People like that shouldn't be waitress & working serving people. Look I don't need red carpet attention or a hug when I walk in a restaurant I just want a refill on my drinks & a smile & just check on us & tell us why it's taking long & a apology that's it. I don't even know if it's the waitresses or cooks that's taking long but the manger needs to find out where the problem is cuz it's frustrating (I use to be a manger at a restaurant it's not that hard to find out what the problem is). Retrain or hire some new fast or at least happier workers. Or maybe you guys just need to have an extra 5 min breaks to just hug each other & practice smiling & drink a Red Bull. I don't know but you guys need to do something.  Like I said the food is good & that's why I will continue to come but everytime we decide we'll come here we take a deep breath & say ""But damn the service is slow & sad"" & sometimes we say oh well & come anyways cuz we love the food but almost everytime we come the service fails us. The food thank god makes up for it but only  enough for 3 stars. This place has potential to get 5 stars if the workers would be happier & a little faster & be more considerate. I wish I can give them more then 3 stars but I can't. Maybe one day I will but till then, come on Red Robin workers cheer up you have a job & we're hungry please be nice & a little faster I'll tip you big I promise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=60

I love how you can order more fries, unfortunately I can never pack in more than one serving.  Service is variable- sometimes not so good, sometimes okay and sometimes great.  It just depends I suppose on how busy the restaurant staff are.  The milkshakes are yummy but filling, hard to drink that and have a burger.  Overall food is okay and service is random.  Good luck! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=120

Been here twice now and on the first visit, our server had only talked to us twice--1st time was to check on our order and second was to give us our check. We got our entrees waaay before our appetizer, which came while we were halfway through our dinner. Second and even worse time, they quoted us 20-25mins for a table but actually got seated close to an hour later. And if that wasn't bad enough, it took 10 minutes (yes, we timed it after the horrendous wait time for the table) before a server actually paid any attention to us. And then, par for the course, said server went to check on us only twice yet again, just like the server on our first visit! She seemed more than happy to attend to the other tables except the two on our side. Thank God they've got those Ziosks on every table now, otherwise I shudder to think how long it's going to take them to give us our check and how long to get our card back.

Tom H.,"San Marcos, CA",67,73,108,1.0,12/28/2014,"I can't believe that so many people go to this particular restaurant. The red robin in UTC is farther away, but it is far superior in every single aspect. This one in Bonita is just terrible.  My wife has some strict dietary requirements that only a few big chains cover, and thankfully red robin meets these requirements. Unfortunately, we live close to this location. We don't have too many options for dining out, and if my wife wants a night out at a restaurant that doesn't require a 45 minute drive, this is the only option:( The service is routinely slow.  Don't trust the people up front when they tell you how long the wait will be; tonight we were told 20 minutes and waited just over an hour. The food just doesn't taste as good as any other red robin, it just is bland. Also, if you order a gluten free bun, expect it to be stale, that way you won't be disappointed when it comes. They won't let you sit outside; ever. I don't know why they even bother with tables out there.  Tables sit unbused for long periods of time while the pile of people waiting u the door grows larger.  Right now I'm counting three tables with dirty dishes and 10 people waiting by the door. It just feels like the management at this location is consciously understaffing to save money.  The waiters, in my experience, don't seem particularly happy or interested in human interaction.

We both ordered the tavern double and two of the Not Your Father's Root Beer Floats and they were AMAZING! I was skeptical at first but that first sip changed my mind. The beer itself is 5.9% or something like that but they give you the rest of the bottle so you can refill it. My only complaint is that it's not bottomless! The burgers were good of course and fries were filling but the real winner for me is still the Jalapeño Coins in the pick 2 App deal. They aren't CRAZY spicy and just a little salty. The mozzarella sticks are good too. We are always full and happy when we leave here and that's what we go for.

We always end up needing to order a second basket right when we get our first basket in order to prevent time with no fries.

Kendell W.,"San Diego, CA",133,4,,1.0,10/1/2016,"If I could give zero stars I would but This was by far the worst restaurant experience we've ever had. First we were told it would be a 20-25 minute wait for a party of 2, understandable it was a Friday and it seemed pretty busy. They asked us for a phone number and told us they would text when our table was ready. There were no seats inside so we just sat outside to wait. 30 minutes go by still no seat, 45 minutes still no seat, an hour goes by still no seat so I go in to check how much longer the wait is. I ask the hostess she looks through the list and she says that it doesn't look like my name is on the list. She said that her manager reset the list and that we weren't the first ones to come up saying the didn't get sat. She then went to get her manager but when she came back she said that they didn't want to come up and that she's sorry that it's gonna be another 15 minutes. As I'm walking out of the door the manager came out and then asked me what happen then sat us after a few minutes. He took our drink order, we got a freckled lemonade and a raspberry limeade. Our actual waitress brought out our drinks then took our food order and we ordered the Nacho.m.g for an appetizer, I got the buzz Mac n cheese burger cooked medium well , and my girlfriend got the a1 burger cooked well done. So the nachos come out first and a different girl brought out our food. By this time I was done with my first drink and I set the empty glass at the edge of the table. The nachos had barely any cheese at all and the little cheese it did have was all in the middle and was microwaved too long. Shortly after the nachos came the same girl that brought out our nachos brought out our burgers. My girlfriend takes a bite out of her burger and it was the complete opposite of well done and mine, when asked for medium well, was extra well done. For me it wasn't a big deal I still could eat mine but for hers it was unacceptable so we press the call server button on the table. We wait about 10-15 minutes again for her to just come up to our table. Now again she didn't bring out our food just took our order and this is 10-15 minutes after we've already started eating and this server never once came to check on us or ask if our food is tasting okay. We ask if she can bring it back to make it well done she takes it and they make a whole new burger. Now by the time we get a new burger my girlfriend has already finished her drink and she drinks extremely slow. When they bring out the new burger a new person brings it out, sets it on the table and walks away without saying anything. This burger was cooked fine so we continue to eat but, still have no refills on drinks, no water and also no napkins. Now I could probably wave my hand and ask for a refill but I feel I shouldn't have to especially if my server has ignored us literally the entire time and she even walked past our table multiple times and looked over at our table. So it's getting close to the end and my girlfriend wanted to take the rest of her food home. So we hit the call server button again and this time we wait another 10 minutes for her to come to the table so we ask for a box. We watch our server go back and fourth with a table next to us and also receive boxes and refills. Another 10-15 minutes go by and by this point I got the attention of the guy that sat us in the beginning and let him know what else had happen. It only took him a couple minutes to get us a box and he also gave us a 25 dollar gift card because I had already paid while waiting for the box and we just wanted to leave. I've served for many years in the past and this girl should definitely find a new job. We won't ever be coming back to this location for red robin.

Andi C.,"La Mesa, CA",1,4,,1.0,10/11/2016,I was pretty disappointed in this establishment. The service was extremely slow and our waitress although very nice was very young and lacked the professional demeanor and knowledge that I've come to expect at any restaurant. I love eating out and love trying new places and am usually able to give second chances if the first time was not satisfactory. But the food tasted like a dried out McDonald's meal. And to have to wait 20 minutes for a drink and then another 20 minutes for fries is just ridiculous.

The stack of onion rings is fun to eat.  The rings are yummy with a right combo of onion to batter, and its nice and crispy.  The only thing is that they're obviously the frozen variety because they're so perfect.  They're definitely good, but there are a lot of places in SD that have more of a handmade touch. The basic cheeseburger is just ok.  Its more like a whopper because it seems like the condiments overtake the patty.  The meat doesnt have a flame grill or char character to it. The bbq chicken salad was very tasty with lots of texture.  I'd probably only come back here for the fries, and to try something other than a burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=140

I ordered the Freckled Lemonade and the Royal Red Robin burger with garlic herb fries and decided to try the bacon aioli. I really liked the Freckled Lemonade and it's definitely one of my favorite drinks there (the twisted cup it comes in is really cute). As for the burger, the patty was cooked fine but the egg was slightly underdone. Adding a little of the bacon aioli helped boost the flavor but it was just alright.

Megan C.,"San Diego, CA",1,33,3,1.0,8/1/2014,"Ok, so a Red Robin is a Red Robin--I won't comment on the overall experience of eating at this chain restaurant. It is what it is. Just a couple of things about this particular location: First, for the gluten-free folks, every time I order a burger on the gluten-free bun here, it's SUPER stale. I have not had that experience at other RR locations so I don't know what the problem is here. Maybe they're storing them in the freezer too long. Second, it's always hot in there. Either they don't have air conditioning or it can't keep up. The waitstaff have always been nice, but eating a hockey puck while sweating is no fun. Update: if you do go like we just did (I never learn, apparently) avoid sitting in the bar area. The male bartender/waiter who is there at lunch time on weekends didn't write down our order and was multitasking while half-listening to our orders today. Sure enough, both of our meals were wrong--my husband's burger cooked wrong (he ate it anyway) and my burger on a bun when I ordered it in the lettuce wrap due my dietary restrictions. No apology or even glimmer of acknowledgement after I had to wait for them to make mine over again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=140
Shanel S.,"Sterling Heights, MI",704,827,917,2.0,6/9/2014,"When I hear bottomless... I'm there! Next time I hear bottomless and it has Red Robin in there somewhere... I'll probably pass. Not sure if it's this particular location, but they are slooooow. Our waitress took forever to take our order so when she finally came, we were able to put our food and drink order in together. One of the people in my party ordered a salad but since the waitress didn't like coming to our table, she decided to bring the salad with her burger instead. I ordered the Double Tavern Burger thing and it was a Burger King burger for sure. Just three times the price. I would say that the plus is the bottomless fries, but she decided she didn't want to bring any until we asked. Keep in mind we have a party of four and there are about seven fries on each of our plates. Three of the four had hot fries in their basket and I had semi-stale and very cold fries in mine. Luckily the ONE basket of fries she ever brought was hot so I was able to eat those. Our drinks were also never refilled and we finished them before the food was out.  I guess she had customers in the kitchen since she was hanging out in there the whole time. I'm assuming her tips are not what paid for her fake breasts.

Tables were left unclean all over the place. It Should have been a sign.  We order the buzz wings as an appetizer to share. Two burgers and drinks. Wings were burned and didn't not taste very good. We had to ask for ranch to help them get some taste. Very disappointed. Burgers were so dry and the buns were too toasts they were burned. We did not finish the burgers. Fries were not great either.

Edward S.,"San Diego, CA",6,12,1,3.0,2/23/2016,"If you're looking for a great burger, you should instead go to Eureka, which is about 50 yards away from Red Robin in the same outdoor mall. Eureka has much better quality burgers for the same (or slightly cheaper) prices. Also, Eureka has much more tasteful and mature atmosphere. Red Robin would probably be better for a family with kids.  They won't cook any burgers less than medium at Red Robin, which is unfortunate, because I prefer medium rare.  The atmosphere at Red Robin is very casual and playful. It's probably great for families with kids. They have iPads (or equivalent tablets) at each table for paying the bill and playing games during your meal. I find the iPads fairly distracting, but depending on the type of group you're with, the iPads could be fun.  I haven't tried them, but Red Robin definitely has some substantial milk shakes and root beer floats.

From start to finish it was a waiting game inbetween our drinks, the appetizer and then the wait for our food to arrive was starting to increase which was making us hungrier and crankier by the minute! Finally, we got our food and lets just say, after you make a grilled cheese and let it sit out, the cheese starts to look rubbery after awhile... yeah, that's what her food looked like. Here's a break down of what we got: Grilled Cheese (just make one at home yourself), Mac & Cheese (which was apparently yummy), a side of mandarins and a side of brocolli (which she liked as well). I got the Blue Ribbon burger which was okay and garlic fries (save yourself the .99 and DONT GET IT!.. there was SOO much salt it was unbearable! I only ate half of one fry). The food was only warm and didn't appear to be fresh out the kitchen which was unfortunate.

I like that they served the Thousand Island on the side, so that I could control the amount I put on my patty melt. The marbled rye was perfectly grilled and had a great crunch with a nice rye flavor. Great patty melt to say the least. The steak fries were good, but my first serving came lukewarm. My second serving came steaming hot straight out of the fryer. They had a crunchy exterior and soft flavorful center. They were much better than my first serving. ( ) The service was great.

We had asked the lady if she could seat us at a table and not a booth, we waited and she quickly came for us to say there was a table available. She sits us at a booth but it was a honest mistake and promptly found a table for us which was kind. Now, the waiter (forgot his name) was friendly at the beginning and brought out drinks in a speedy time. My father ordered an iced tea and we noticed that there were no sweeteners there. We asked our waiter if he could bring some and he was fine with it, however, he was taking a while, so we asked a busser if he could give us some from the table he was cleaning. The busser was really sweet and gave them to us, we even mentioned they hadn't given us napkins nor tupperware and he was surprised. Our waiter was extremely forgetful. He actually never even brought the sweeteners we asked for, nor none of the lemon wedges we asked for with our drinks, and only brought the napkins and tupperware with our dinner (after we had already eaten our onion rings). Our food took a little longer to be brought but that was understandable due to the fact that it was so busy! My only issue with my plate was that he didn't add the avocado to my burger as I had requested but he changed it quickly and I don't think it was too major.

Walked in with a friend of mine, plenty of open booths, some still needed to be cleaned but otherwise open...and instead of asking us where we would like to sit or even sit us where anyone would want to sit (a padded booth) we're sat at the high tables next to the bar...as are the next two groups of people, crammed together. If you lean back just a bit you run the risk of hitting the person behind you. At the time I was too hungry to care or bother to say anything about the seating. Our drink order was taken and returned quickly, as was our food, but the waiter didn't come to check up on us for the rest of the meal....and thanks to our drinks being mostly ice, they went empty pretty quickly (we each got a soda and water). He must have passed our table at least a dozen times, never once asked us if we wanted anything else to drink.... I get it when restaurants get busy you have a smaller chance of being noticed by the wait staff, but they weren't busy....and there isn't an open soda/water fountain where I can re-fill my own cup.  As customer it's frustrating and annoying when you're paying a few bucks extra for the sit-down experience and are promptly ignored.  After looking around the restaurant it seemed odd, tables weren't being cleaned off in a timely manner (one of the tables that had dishes on it was still dirty when we left) and the staff seemed overwhelmed by the few people that were there. Bottom line: food was good, but if you just want a burger and fries, go to In-n-out, or any other red robin, because you shouldn't spend the extra time and money in a sit down restaurant that is filled with unobservant and unhelpful staff.

I have been to the UTC Red Robin several times and I have never had to ask for a refill on anything and I felt like a priority. Maybe the UTC location should be the training center.

My boyfriend and I went in for lunch and were looking forward to using our royalty card to get out free item. My boyfriend had to change his order because his first one didn't qualify as the free item. Only to find out that we can't get the free burger because my card wasn't registered, even though I went on line and registered the card the night we got it. If there was a problem with my card, one of the other associates should have told me one of the other 9 times we were there. The manager came up with 101 reasons as to why we could not get the free burger. He was just very unfriendly and not willing to help one bit.

I have never been to a red robin before and the experience that I recieved was well worth the anticipation.  The food... was amazing!!! My favorite item of the night was the tower of onion rings with campfire mayo!!! So bomb. Service.... My server was so kind and so attentive to my big group of 10. She really went the extra mile in making sure that I had the best experience ever. She really worked out the itty bitty things for us like more refills more fries extra sauces and seperate checks. If I'm correct her name was melissa. :)))  Will definitely come back for more onion rings and great service.

I know how that works. We sat and the server came quickly and took our order. The food took almost 20 minutes to arrive and in those 20 minutes never once did the server pass by to see if we needed anything or to bring us at least fries with our meals.. and we were STARVING!!!!  Once the food finally arrived, My burger tasted funny and the fries were cold! uggggggh... ok, I was hungry so I kept eating... I was looking for the server for a while to get some new fries, but did she ever pass by? NO. I think she was new because she seemed rather lost as she was standing around by the kitchen line (I could see her from my table)... she finally walked on to the dining room and I had to flag her down. Throughout our whole dining experience, she never said ""thank you"" or ""hello"" or even ""how's everything?""... when she passed by to get her tip, not even then did she say ""thank you"" or at least ""have a nice day""... she just took it and left.

I came w/ my two teenage kids at about 4pm & it wasnt busy at all. The server was nice but only checked on us one time. We didn't get to enjoy the bottomless drinks because as I said previously the server only checked on us ONCE!! I ordered the riblets & mac n cheese...the riblets were over cooked & the mac n cheese was cold in the middle...now we all know that if sumthns cold in the middles its because it was previously made & frozen until it needed to be served...thats a no no for me. I ordered a salted caramel shake my FAVORITE but it wasn't tonight because tonight it came out in this rinky dink little water cup!!! Wha da heo!?! It usually comes out in a shake class w/ the extra onv the side!!! At the end of service I was given the check that didn't have our right orders on it & I could've just paid for the one person meal I was charged for but I was honest & asked for my hefty size check for the 3 of us lol the only good thing I can say is the prices really are reasonable but other than that boo on you Plaza Bonita Red Robin boooooo!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=160

The food is delightful. I suggest getting the onion ring stand, at least that's what I call it. You can either get 6 or 12 nice size onion rings on a rack. Great for ring lovers. If you love burgers then you will love all the many selections they have. I say each time you visit try a new burger. The only thing I had to check them on was the milk shake was ordered to go. They didn't fill it up to the top. And if you know milk shakes you know it's filled to the top not 3/4's that's a milk shake sin... However, they were nice enough to take and fill it up.

Ordered 2 burgers and 2 drinks. Order came 50 minutes later!!!! Husband left after 40 min because his lunch break ended. He didn't even get to eat a fry! I just about walked out but I flagged our server down-who was so busy chit chatting she didn't notice our sense of urgency, and I told her to just have them box it up. Honestly, I don't know why I didnt just cancel the order and pay for the stupid drinks...I was trying to be nice. Server apologized and explained that they had very little kitchen help and that was why they were so slow. She went out of her way to ask management to comp our meal. I thought it was just a bad experience and didn't want to write them off. Present: it was not that busy in the restaurant at 9p but it took forever to get our drink order in. We had to ask for utensils from our server. Both of us got the wrong buns for our burgers and it took over 30 minutes to get our food.  The tables and menus were sticky. Will not go back EVER.

John K.,"San Diego, CA",16,169,181,3.0,5/25/2015,"Just another burger and french fries joint showcasing American cuisine. I felt that the atmosphere here (in terms of the interior decor) reminded of the 1950s. After all, this business started during that timeframe. I want to note that service here is great. I even saw the manager come to each table to make sure everything was all right. Good business practice! As for the food, I was really excited to try the Red Robin Gourmet Cheeseburger. One, it registered as the ""Holy Grail"" burger in the burger hierarchy. Two, it was the seminal product in determining any future visits. The burger seemed like any other burger, see photos. I suppose the true distinguishing mark is the brand's way of making the product. In addition, I found the steak fries very soft and golden. It tastes so good when dipped into barbecue sauce. To conclude, I would say that the atmosphere is welcoming, service is good, but the food is not anything to be jumping unicorns and rainbows about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=160

That and the fact that they couldn't find a table for a high chair. What place doesn't accommodate havin a child with them?? My husband and I felt very frustrated and to be honest the girls up front made us feel as if having our baby with us was our fault and the reason for the long wait. Manager was nowhere around. We left upset, hungry and with a cranky baby. We could have had her in her stroller that whole time we were waiting. But no, we couldn't bring the stroller in with us.

Atmosphere and service was decent. Got my refills promptly. They do what they're known for pretty well - namely their steak bottomless fries and their freckled lemonade. Both are quite addicting and before you know it you'll have finished either/or or both before you finished your burger. I'm not a ketchup person so the fries can be a bit plain without them - try them with the signature seasoning salt. The lemonade is very sweet and the strawberries are sweet enough to munch on as a dessert. For some reason I ended up getting fish & chips. My brother made fun of me as I got FISH AND CHIPS at a BURGER JOINT. I think I'll stick to burgers, as I have gotten much bigger and much better quality fish & chips for about the same price at pubs, even with the vinegar and tartar sauce. The gooey chocolate brownie cake is anything but gooey - Chilis does it better. The cake was quite dry. Also don't see how it can be any better with strawberries. Supposedly they have a St. Patricks Day shake - Guinness, Jameson and chocolate ice cream. Now I know how to make Irish Car Bomb shakes!

Campfire and Ranch sauce.  *Red Robin Gourmet Cheese Burger: 4/5 I knew on my first visit that I should try what they are known for so I figured why not their original.  *Banzai Burger: 3/5 The idea of putting a slice of pineapple in a burger was kinda weird for me but was OK overall.  *Clam Digger's Clam Chowder: 3/5 it's OK. I've had better at BJ's Brew house but still good.  *Rookie Magic: 4/5 Hershey Chocolate syrup with Oreo cookies mixed in with vanilla, makes you want to bath in it because it's soo good.

At first I didn't mind, but my boyfriend kept on mentioning how freezing it was because people would be exiting and coming in through the exit every 5 minutes or so. I also noticed that we were seated far away from everybody else as well and this made the servers less likely to come to our area.  We ordered a salted caramel milkshake which tasted extremely salty so we had to get the attention of a waitress and asked to get it remade with less salt. When our food finally arrived ( with a different waitress before ) we asked about our salted caramel milkshake and she looked confused, when I overheard her talking with the bartender that made our drink, he said "" no they didn't want it, they said it tasted too salty ."" The waitress came back and apologized telling us she would remake it. When it was remade and finally set on our table, we took a sip and it turned out to be a vanilla milkshake. No hint of caramel whatsoever. We asked to take it off our bill and the waitress looked a bit upset.

It is on the outside of the mall and a great option while shopping. Reasons to avoid: 1) Value.  At this particular location, the service and quality of food simply doesn't match the prices that are paid. 2) Location.  You can pay under the amount of Red Robin and get better quality food next door at the Mexican restaurant. 3) Service.  I have a few pet peeves that abrasively irk my soul: bad drivers, people who don't pick up their dog's p00p (especially if I have to clean it off my shoe) & not getting the check paid for when I am ready to leave a stinkin' food establishment.  These guys hit hard enough on the third that I am not going back.  Too many other options with El Torito next door and the food court inside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=220

It was good but the fact that there was a hair in my soup did not jive with me! The last of our appetizer chicken tenders was not cooked thru and it took for ever to get refills. Not a good first impression:/ oh my son. Got sick from the spaghetti he ordered. So my husband n family decided to give red ribbon one more shot we went to UTC about three weeks later.

Oh, they have big ol' bottomless steak fries with their special seasoning (you can find their seasonong on any table you sit at). If you're not in a mood for a burger, they have chicken sandwiches, soups, not a big variety of wraps though, However they have a decent amount of appetizers - great for group events.  Overall, I'm there for their great customer service. My server was fantastic (Jody), she was on top of things. Everytime, I've been there I have requested her since.  Although, it gets busy Fridays thru Sundays. It's worth being patient. If the food is good, the wait is worth it. That's how I feel when I go to Red Robin.  Beware this is a kid-friendly place, so there will be a lot crying. I love children, so I'm able to put up with them and very patient. You can ask additional stuff such as extra veggies, condiments, etc. People who are have allergies or who do not want to consume gluten or/and vegetarians they have several options for them. One last thing, they have this Royality card. If you sign up, you get a free appetizer which expires 2 weeks once you activate it. You're eligible for a daily drawing to win daily prizes.

That doesnt do the whole situation justice after being embarrassed in front of others that were eating in the restaurant. Not only was she wrong she was embarrassing as well.

Ryan H.,"Redlands, CA",43,46,70,2.0,4/30/2011,"I don't know if they were just short on people or they just plain suck at serving people. Seriously!!! So here's the deal. Me, my wife, and my youngest go in at like 7:40pm on a Thursday night. Happy hour starts in another 20 minutes. Life is good. Well, my wife really wants to try a grasshopper and asks if they can make one for her. If I remember correctly the server went to go see and returned stating that they have a full bar so they can pretty much make anything. Hey, it is Red Robin right. Well, I decide I'll hold off on my drink order so I can take advantage of the $2.50 drafts in like another 15 minutes or so, so I just ask for water.  Several minutes later, like way too long later, the server returns with two waters and states that they can't make a grasshopper for whatever reason. And by the way, the grasshopper only has two different kinds of liquors and milk or cream. And they really should have those two liquors in stock. Seriously pathetic that they can't make it and that we had to wait soooo long to find this out. In fact, the people next to us, who arrived after us, leaned over to ask us if we waited foreve to be served. Maybe they were wondering if they were being discriminated based on their race. No!!! The service just sucks here.  Moving right along. 8:00pm comes and no food. That's fine as I go and get my beer. The bartender here had no personality and was constantly leaving the bar to do this and that. She couldn't care less about me and that fact that I was looking at her as she took off to the kitchen and whatever else every time I went to the bar for another drink. Three drinks in total. Oh, and the $2.50 drafts during happy hour are only for the crappy beers. Two in total I think. So anything good, forget about. Almost $4.00 for happy hour beers with flavor like Fat Tire and Newcastle. Geez, I can go to Wing Stop on H street in Bonita and get Fat Tire for only $1 all day Wednesday. And I have. And I wrote a review. And you can and should read it. And I was buzzed, thank you very much. So a funny thing happened during all this. While we were sitting there forever, another server came over to greet us and get our drink order. She was in the area the entire time. I mean, did you not see us sitting there forever? If so, wouldn't the first thing out of your mouth be an apology for the wait? Of course we told her we had been helped and she moved on.  So on to the food. I got the whiskey burger thing and fries. All quite good, and especially good with a nice cold Newcastle. My wife ordered the Clucks & Shrimp. Wow it was pathetic. I can't remember how she liked it, but we just looked at those pathetic little shrimps like, ""what the heck?"" I picked it up for a closer look as the server came by and she asked if she could help or something. We just told her it wasn't what was expected and she apologized.  My daughter got the kids burger meal, which she gobbled down the burger quite well. The only thing is, we asked for a lemonade and never got it. Luckily we had some apple juice for her.  So anyways, the server never came to our table after giving us our food. Not once for refills for my wife's drink or to see if I wanted more fries, which I did. I was really hungry. When we got the bill I told the server we never got the lemonade that was to come with my daughters meal. She apologized and offered it at that moment to go. We declined. She really should have discounted the meal. Right? So I left a small tip, and it should have been smaller. I just feel uncomfortable leaving nothing.  I want to say it is the managers fault or they were short on staff or something. I just didn't see that things were so busy or so crazy in there to explain the level of service we got. It sucked. It sucked bad. Two stars only because the burgers were still good and maybe this was a rare occurrence, but we seriously won't be going back to find out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=260

I got one of their salad wraps or w.e once it wasn't that great. I love their burgers though. My most recent order was their Chili Chili Cheese Burger. It was like heaven in my mouth. At first I was soo confused on how to eat it (I needed a knife) Haha The server failed to give me one but then he noticed real quick about it so it was good.

At one point she was walking by, and I asked her for napkins and fries, but she did not hear the fries part because she didn't even stop to listen to what else I wanted, she kept on walking and left me talking by myself.

Maybe I'm spoiled by the many other delicious burger joints in San Diego, but my friend and I who dined here even compared it to McDonald's and sadly, we agreed at McDonald's would've been better.  The main point of our complaint was the food, we both ordered our burgers medium rare and the burger was overcooked therefore, they were burnt. The other problem with our burgers was the fact that it tasted PLAIN! The only flavor was the charred taste. I ordered the guacamole and bacon burger and there was such a thin layer of guacamole that I didn't taste it through the lettuce. The bacon tasted as though it was cooked once then microwaved and thrown into my burnt burger.  As for the bottomless fries, no one offered us a refill on them. Much less offered us more water to wash down the burnt flavor.  At the end of the day I would never return to this location nor would I recommend it to anyone...

Henry T.,"San Diego, CA",126,516,36,2.0,12/19/2010,"Khann and I really lucked out on a crowded Saturday night yesterday when we were looking for something to eat before watching TRON: Legacy at the IMAX theater. We were originally going to go to the Red Robin but parking was impossible at 6:30 at night so we tried the Outback Steakhouse. That was too crowded so we walked all the way to the Red Robin. First of all, I thought the entrance to the place was INSIDE the mall. It was just outside the sliding doors. But we lucked out. As soon as we went inside the kitschy place, we were immediately seated in a tiny table for two. Khann was initially going to order the spicy Buffalo wings appetizer but he was going to eat that dish alone because I can't handle spice. So he stayed away from all of the appetizers. I ordered the salsa and guacomole chips appetizer instead. Khann had one of the Red Robin Monster burgers, which I still maintain are gut-busting, heart attack type of foods. Disturbing to have such foods in midst of all the restaurant is promoting to kids. I wasn't in the mood for burgers. I realized what a mistake it was to go to this place when someone isn't in a burger mood. When you neglect the entire burger section of the menu, there's precious little alternatives to choose from. The last time I went to a Red Robin, it was in February and in Oregon and I was determined not to repeat the mushroom burger mistake. But there really wasn't anything appetizing in the rest of the menu. I ultimately ordered the Prime Rib Dip, which came as something that looked like an undersized Philly cheese steak. Ironically, Khann called his burger an oversized In-N-Out Double Double. The bread was so hard on my prime rib sandwich that I couldn't use my knife to cut through the bread. I didn't want to pick up the sandwich because there was a lot of grease on the bread. The only good thing for me was the rasberry limeade. Great drink. The fries were way too salty. The coleslaw was okay, but I'm not much of a coleslaw fan. The nachos and guac were good. Wow, the place is kitschy and way overdressed for Christmas. Do you really need all the dressing up and bells and whistles? There was a person a table over who had a birthday and instead of singing them the traditional song, the staff did some kind of weird drill chant. $40 for the two of us and the meal felt like a letdown.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=280

I asked the host if it was at all possible to eat outside on their ""patio"" since we had a stroller, and out child was sleeping. (Any parent knows why this was important to us.) I explained that I worked in this business as well, and I knew it was busy and if it was a problem, I understood. She said she would ask the manager, which she did, and the manager, I was told, said yes. She told us to pick a place to sit, brought us menus, and told us she let the server know. We wait, and wait. I picked the seat near the door so we could see into the bar area and so we would be seen as well, just in case we would be forgotten about. I even went inside and spoke with the host again, in case she forgot we were there. We wait some more. I notice multiple servers and even a manger walk by the door and make eye contact with me. NO ONE EVER CAME!!!  I understand they were busy, but, being a service manager myself, if you notice people outside, maybe check on them or follow up with a server/manager. Or maybe the manager should not have said yes to the request if they couldn't handle it.  We finally left. We walked by 30 min later, our menus were still on the table. Thank goodness we didn't sit and wait longer. My husband and I were looking forward to a meal together, out in public! Any parent knows what a rare occasion that can be.

Two thumps up for the Fat Tire on tap.  My friend ordered the Big Cheeseburger with steak cut fires. However, I took several bites of his burger and and his fries. The fries were really good with Red Robyn seasoning and ketchup. The burger was pretty big(not as big as Islands) and it was tasty(Reminds me of Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction, Big kahuna Burger, haha) and one of the cool things was that the sodas are about $2.75 but with unlimited refills and so does the fries. Very cool! They tend to fill up the entire glass with ice. Not cool! So, Make sure to ask for easy on the ice.  The customer service was incredibly excellent. The entire staff was happy and friendly.

Once she came back and gave us the drinks, we asked for a little more time. Couple of minutes had passed, and we waited until she got back to us. Each time; however, she passed out table she would tell us to wait as she served another table. Couple more minutes and we were again asked to wait and she'll be back. It was a total of three times we were told to wait. By the time she came by we were definitely annoyed. She took our orders, and I had ordered A bacon cheeseburger with a side of ranch. We waited about 15 minutes for the food to be prepared, but it was beyond disappointing. The burgers were small and about the size of in n outs burger. Unfortunately, she forgot about my side of ranch, and it did not bother me until I was practically almost done with my burger and fries.... We reminded her several times and by the time, I was on my last bite she had brought it out. I don't want to be charged extra for a sauce I was not able to enjoy.

I've been enjoying this location because it's not super busy, my kiddos love to play at the little playground in the mall and often I can run an errand at Target too.  I LOVE the red robin rewards!   On the burger front, let me just say that I wish they would stop asking me how I'd like it cooked?  I've been five times now and not once have they made it medium rare.  It's always well done.  SO, get some sauce, grab the salt and pepper and enjoy it for what it is.  A very neat place to enjoy a burger with friends AND your kiddos.   End of it all ask for a balloon for your kiddos on the way out or even on the way in; it's always a good thing for the kiddos. Average cost for two adults and two kiddos (without adult beverages) in the $30 - $35 range.  And I have to say WAY better than Denny's!!!!  Do yourself a favor and don't go to Denny's for lunch or dinner if you can hit up the Red Robin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=240

If you are into sports, good place to watch a game if your stomach craves burgers. I DO NOT recommend the mac n' cheese. I am a huge mac n' cheese fanatic and its literally blan here.

Tamarah G.,"Chula Vista, CA",12,87,4,1.0,10/1/2013,"I am changing my review from 3 stars to 1 star. I went here recently for lunch. The place was MAYBE 1/4 of the way full and I counted at least four waitresses and a hostess on the floor when I came in. I waited with my kids for about five minutes  before we were seated (and we were the only ones waiting). We were seated and the waitress took our drink order right away (we all just got waters). Those came quickly, she disappeared for about ten minutes and didn't come back for our food order until I ran out of water. She took our order, refilled my water and disappeared again. It took a good 25 minutes for our food to come out and I saw two tables that came in AFTER us get their food while we waited. My poor kids waited so patiently, I think they did better than I did. I was ready to leave when our food finally came out. It was good, but not worth the wait and low blood sugar.  My youngest had to go the bathroom, so I took both of my kids (they're young), leaving my sunglasses on the table. We passed our waitress, I informed her that we would be back in a minute. I don't know if she was spaced out or what, but we were in the bathroom for no more than 2 minutes and when we came out our table was cleared off, including my sunglasses. I sat down and waited for the disappearing waitress. I was there for a couple minutes, flagged her down and explained what happened. She disappeared into the kitchen and I waited another 7 or 8 minutes and never saw her or my sunglasses again :( I don't think I will ever be going back to this Red Robin. Or any of them.

You could tell she was working hard, probably had been there a while and was about to end her shift.  She was very nice as we explained that we didn't care for the meal.  We tipped her anyways because she was kind and it wasn't like she was the one cooking and preparing the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=200

Lynley M.,"La Mesa, CA",112,51,38,3.0,10/14/2015,First time at a red robin ever and it horrible. . First off walked in and a family with 3 babies and 3 women were in front of us. A woman (I'm assuming the hostess or a waitress) came up to the counter and didn't say anything but just stared at us. I had to say that the women with kids were there before us. She sat them and walked behind the line (where they prepare food ). My husband and I then stood at the door waiting to be seated for 5 minutes. MIND YOU THE RESTAURANT IS DAMN NEAR EMPTY. So I was pretty confused and pissed to see that we weren't being seated. My intentions were to leave then but my husband said let's just go sit at the bar. So we sit there and wait for another 5 minutes for a waitress to acknowledge us. She finally brings us menus and water. I don't know her name because she didn't introduce herself. We ordered pretty quickly and got our appetizer fast. I saw the manager walking around finally in her pink polka dotted shirt speaking to various tables but never came to ours. My burger was salty but still ok. I order the tavern double with grilled mushrooms. I'll come back when you guys decide that you want to have a proper hostess who will sit us since she clearly did see us or i'll just got to another location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=200
Jerahmeel B.,"La Jolla, CA",392,59,70,3.0,10/16/2011,"Bottomless GARLIC steak fries!  I like to order the bottomless GARLIC steak fries. I'm not a fan of just regular steak fries cause it's so easy for them to end up dry. I don't know, it might just be me. The garlic steak fries have, of course, garlic and shredded cheese sprinkled on top. BOMB! But at the table, there's a bottle of seasoning which you must add! They offer you the choice of ranch as a side, and they already have ketchup available at the table. When I'm full, I always ask for another order of garlic steak fries, then take them to go right after. Mwuahaha.  They currently have the Oktoberfest Burger for $6.99. It has swiss cheese, beer mustard grilled onions and black forest ham on toasted pretzel buns. The burger was pretty good. Kinda small, tbh, and the buns might be a bit hard since it's toasted and pretzel buns. To me, their burgers are alright, but I was completely satisfied as I was starving. If you ask to have your burgers cut in half, they wrap each half individually so it's less messy to eat.  I've also tried their Burnin' Love Burger, at roughly $8 if I remember correctly. It has fried jalapeno rings, salsa, and spicy pepper jack cheese on top of their seasoned beef. This burger was pretty good! The jalapenos are questionable, but it definitely works. It gives the burger an extra kick. If you don't mind a bit of spiciness in your burger, then you def gotta try this one out.  I love the liveliness of this Red Robin. There are random frames all over the walls, and I love that you'll honestly never get bored cause there's always something new to look at. Great location for friends and family. Very enjoyable.

Bottomless soda drinks and Steak fries( regular or Parmesan garlic) and don' t forget the red robin seasoning powder... UMMMM!  We have been to this restaurant about 6 times since they opened and have yet to find a burger ( $7 - 10) we didn't like!  We have tried the burgers and wraps ...they are very fresh and filling!  The staff is very friendly, warm and accommodating.  Red (the bird dressed costume guy) is cute and friendly .Kids seem to really enjoy his interaction at your table. They have FREE latex branded balloons for kids. The kids menu $ 4 - 6 is pretty good (chicken fingers, pizza, mac n cheese, spaghetti comes with a side of veggies or fruit) and has a nice take home plastic red robin cup with a lid!  On the last couple of visits in March a manager came by to check on us and gave us scratcher cards.. we won a FREE soda drinks for later use in April, we thought the sctratches were a little odd.

J S.,"San Diego, CA",0,33,,3.0,10/13/2011,"Great Food! But what's wrong with this location!? I recently discovered that  this location--a bit of a drive from my home. I've been somewhat disappointed.  The first few times were unremarkable. Not great, not terrible. My last visit the restaurant ran out of spinach and artichoke dip. Isn't that like a favorite everywhere? ...and I have never understood restaurants that run out of food. What's up with that?  Today I had a sweet server who just couldn't get it right. Nothing came as ordered or when ordered. Never did get that lemon I asked for in my beverage. I had to ask for a refill, for napkins, then for silverware. Each time the server left the table to get what she forgot previously she'd be sure to serve several other customers first. I don't understand why someone who was just seated is getting their beverage before I get mine when I asked for one before they were seated.  To top it off it took for ever to get my appetizer. I asked for a side of Baja Ranch, which apparently they ran out of and were making. I was told 20 minutes into my service. The server scurried off before asking if I'd like a replacement. Now 30 minutes into service I'm still waiting for the ranch that I had to beg for as a replacement. I'm just sitting here waiting for something to dip my fry's into and they are getting cold.  If RR didn't have great food they would get one star. If I rated the food today...they'd get one star. The burger was dry with little of the promised sauce that the burger normally has on it.  It's not busy here, but the service is a disaster and there isn't a manager in sight to ask to correct things. I'm afraid my server might get lost on the way to the kitchen and back if I ask her to find the manager. Wait!? Actually I'm not sure she even works here--she's so lost she may have even found herself at the wrong restaurant today!  I wish I'd gone to Carl's Junior for a steakhouse burger and saved my money!!! I'd have paid a lot less to get my order wrong.  Oh by the way! There's my Ranch and she tells me ""It's just regular ranch."" Too bad my lunch hour is over. If you're a server and wonder why you get stiffed--this is why!?

In regards to the food my daughter ordered a Black Pepper Bacon burger on ciabatta which she loved. She said it was cooked to perfection. My grandma got a simple double cheese burger from the kids menu which was just the right size since she doesn't have a huge appetite.

Many places like to be snooty and only seat you when everyone is present. When we were seated, our waitress, Erin was SUPER DUPER nice and kept giving us basket of endless fries as we waited for our other friends to arrive. She even gave us separate dipping sauces for each person when we asked for ranch and honey mustard. I've been to the one in La Jolla and the waiters get annoyed when you ask for early fries before your meal. I also hate when the basket has like 5 fries in it so you feel like you keep bugging them by asking for more. Instead, our waitress kept 3 baskets steadily refilled on the table and when she had to go on break, the waiter who took over was just as nice. Our group stayed until closing and we were never rushed out, we were still asked for refills for drinks and fries, and just had a wonderful dinner catching up with old friends.

The waitress came up quickly and kind of explained the menu and everything (I wasn't paying too much attention, sorry). While my niece and I debated on the food and drinks a weird thing caught my attention, a TV in the waiting area. The decor was cute a mix of older and new. I ordered the Chili Chili Cheeseburger with steak cut fries that had parmesan and herbs on it and my niece had the Bacon Cheeseburger with regular steak cut fries. My burger was nice and juicy but a little greasy due to the chili in it but good none the less. Midway through my meal the waitress brings another soda because ""my ice had melted."" That was pretty awesome, I just take forever to drink when I'm eating so this was a nice thought but it did make me feel like I had to finish the one I started with.

We've had Maggie as our waitress on more than 5 occasions and she is the best waitress. Always helpful and kind, bringing refills before we even ask and remembering special orders perfectly.     This past week we had a differnt waitress and I'm trying not to be bias but the service was awful. We kindly asked for fries when we ordered our meal. We waited about 10 minutes, never got any. Our meal came 15 minutes after ordering but still no fries. We kept trying to flag down the waitress but she kept walking by, looking away. Finally half way through our meal we got her attention. We asked for the fries along with some ketchup and drink refills since both our drinks were empty. On this particular night it a Thursday and not nearly as crowded as it was when we've still had EXCELLENT service with Maggie. Well we finished with our meal and still didnt get the fries. The waitress finally brought the bill along with a basket of fries, no ketchup and did not refill the drinks.         We put our credit card in the folder right away as we didnt want to wait another 15 minutes for her to come by and pick it up, but she turned and walked away even though we put the credit card in the folder in front of her. A few minutes later, a waiter came by and took the folder with our credit card for us. Our waitress brought back the folder with the receipt.        The next morning when we went to use the credit card at Home Depot we realized it was not in my husband's wallet. Red Robin was the last place we used it. After thinking about it I am positive they did not bring the credit card back in the folder with the receipt. There is no way we would have left the credit card on the table.       I called Red Robin to ask if they had the credit card and they said yes, but did not apologize at all. I asked to speak to the manager, told him politely that the service on this occasion was poor quality and that they didnt even bring the credit card back. He turned things on me and said ""it's ok you forgot your card, I understand you probably busy."" I felt like saying, ""no I wasnt busy, the waitress was so busy she didnt provide good service OR bring the credit card back."" We had to cancel the credit card and order another. Not a huge problem but really not what I expect when I go out to eat. We were disappointed in what used to be one of our favorites.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=340
Lovember S.,"San Diego, CA",1,11,,2.0,3/26/2010,Food was okay. They're garlic topped fries are yummy. But the reason I give them two stars is because I ordered a shake and as the waiter was making it at the bar it just sat in front of him while he talked over it for a long while to the bartender. Yuck. Made me lose my appetite. They need to serve their drinks right away instead of letting it sit and gather spit.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=340
Tim W.,"San Diego, CA",17,110,13,4.0,1/28/2011,"Decent place to fill a burger fix. Lots of interesting combinations and even one that has an egg on it. I'm not a fan of this style of fry, I prefer thin and crispy. Why 4 stars for a restaurants with ""decent' burgers and fries I don't care for? I had a great experience. I like the open welcoming setup. Was there after a visit to the mall, got in quick, waitress was attentive. They messed up and didn't sub rings for fries and they fixed that and we kept them both. The BIG seller for me is that my cup was never empty. This waitress was on the top of her game with refills. I drink ALLOT and I drink fast. Water, Soda, Beer it doesn't matter. At most restaurants it is a waiting game. I'm sure most waitresses HATE guys like me that are high maintenance in the refill department but this waitress was on it. I was here about 6 months ago and I wish I got her name because she deserves some credit for impressing me with her refill skills.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=340

Mrett N.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,1.0,4/6/2012,"Reading the other reviews, I'm beginning to wonder if I was at the right place... Anyway the Red Robin in Plaza Bonita was a serious disappointment.   Seriously. A big disappointment.  I really wanted to like this place.  I've seen the commercials and thought I was in for a treat--NOT!  My friend who came with me tried to warn me about the food, that we should go some place else, but on her previous visit to this same Red Robin (she came with someone else), she ordered a salad, not a burger, so I still wanted to go and try Red Robin for myself. Well, I ordered the classic cheeseburger, which arrived barely warm and overcooked.  The patty wasn't juicy at all (rather dry).  The cheese was plastered to it, as though it had been sitting under a heat lamp for half an hour.  The lettuce was wilted. The taste was not memorable--was I supposed to season it myself using the Red Robin's Special Blend on the table??  The bun tasted like they just took it out of a bag and threw the over cooked hamburger on it.  It came with the wilted lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, but nothing on that burger was working in harmony like you'd think it would at a place that claims it serves gourmet burgers.  The steak fries were OK, but no one mentioned anything about them being bottomless--guess I missed out on that one, but you'd think the server would have piped up and offered??  I have to admit that the staff there is very cheerful and pleasant, but perhaps a bit inexperienced.  There was trash on the floor that most of the staff was oblivious to.  After about 40 minutes, one guy actually saw the litter and stopped to pick it up.  No one even asked how the meal was or anything.  I probably should have just sent the burger back and asked for a fresh one, but oh well...  Needless to say, I'll follow my friend's lead next time and won't return.  I could have gotten a much better burger at Carls Jr. for half the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=340

Lucy B.,"San Diego, CA",339,137,684,5.0,4/13/2010,"Red Robin has a decent variety of juicy burgers along with some other items that pretty much suits everyone's taste buds. For people who don't want beef, there's chicken or veggie alternatives. Red Robin is also aware of people who are trying to watch their figures and offer healthy wraps & salads. However, when I go to this place, I throw my diet out the window to dive into the juicy guacamole bacon burger. Another burger that I absolutely loved was a cheeseburger that had all the fixings with an egg in the middle.. You may think it's weird just like i thought at first, but you must try! Also, some of the meals come with bottomless steak fries. Usually, i prefer thin fries over thick.. But these are definitely a winner because they're crisp on the outside & tender inside. I love to sprinkle the Red Robin seasoned salt that you'll find on every table, along with their tasty ranch. I love their ranch.. It tastes so good with lots of flavor!

I was thinking they would over cook it but the cook did not over cook it. Ya ya.   Now as for the fries they were not over cooked that was a surprise as well and they were not bad tasting as well. The services this is always tricky one because some are good and bad now I did notes that they don't like to answer you when you call. I seen the manger walk by and he did not answer keep walking though that was odd then he came up a little later and ask how it was going. Ok that is just stupid.

Riz B.,"San Diego, CA",140,56,114,4.0,9/11/2017,"Let me preface this by saying that I dont usually eat burgers, so I'm certainly hard to please when it comes to getting my order right. I got a margarita which were so good that I got a second round (especially since I don't normally drink, that's pretty big deal.)  I only like mushroom burgers without anything but the patty, cheese & mushroom plus I asked for extra mushroom & today I was served the perfect burger with a mountain of mushroom. (Bear in mind extra mushrooms meant that the bread would get soggy, but that's my own doing - besides I don't usually eat all of the bun anyways) Kudos to the server tonight (& I wish I had paid attention to her name, cuz she was great) so I have say getting my order right is definitely worth a mention. ... and of course Bottomless fries, which I like fat potatoey fries.  It's kickoff night so naturally it was loud, but not too busy & paying the check on the machine thing made it really easy to just get up & go. There's ample parking around the mall, or accessible by multiple bus routes. Locating the restaurant can be a bit tricky, it's upstairs by the food court & you actually have to walk outside to get to the front door.

Our burgers didn't taste freshly made, and the overall wait time for our food was too long for what we ordered.

Service: we waited patiently for our food which took a while as the waitress never followed up. We were never asked how our food was or if we needed anything.  And to top it all off: We were never asked if we needed more endless fries, therefore we asked for more fries being that our burgers were so horrible, and to our surprise the table (which was sat after us) received their endless fries but we were told sorry we are behind on fries and it may take a while.

The ingredients should all meld together into a delicious stack of fries covered in gooey melty yumminess, but this wasn't the case at all. The fried cheese curds did not mesh well with the rest of the plate. The gravy was some bland generic brown variety. My girlfriend got a veggie burger that fell apart and didn't have much taste.

Not once getting frustrated but did an amazing job and has everyone's orders correct. The food was actually pretty good as well. I liked the atmosphere it was very family oriented and the manager kept checking on us as well. Overall a very good 1st time experience and Joselines amazing customer service made the visit perfect.

Bert G.,"San Diego, CA",83,609,444,2.0,10/17/2017,"Planning to go to El Torito for lunch, but found the Plaza Bonita store closed.  Next door, Red Robin became Plan B.  We were greeted and seated immediately.  The restaurant was fairly empty. My wife ordered the Honey-Dijon Wings-N-Chips appetizer ($9.00) and was very pleased with it.  She offered me a wing and it was pretty good.  However, the chips had soaked up the wings dressing, and were soggy.  Probably not a good idea to serve them in a bowl together. My Red Robin Chili Burger ($10.39) was at best, average.  The burger patty was fine, but the chili smothering it was far too simplistic in taste:  Just chili powder and raw onion.  The fries were awful.  Not very warm at all, and leathery.  Obviously old, hard, reheated fries.  I pointed this out to our server, (by clanking a fry on my drink glass) and he offered a bowl of fries to go.  Nope, just wanted to inform you how awful the fries were.  Left most on the plate. Herllien, the server was fine.  The fries were the pits.  We'll avoid this place in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city

We got our food out promptly even though she warned us the wait from the kitchen was reaching 30-40 min.

Aaron P.,"Las Vegas, NV",385,98,326,2.0,3/26/2017,"I give this place two stars solely because the server was very kind and attentive. If not for her, it absolutely deserved one after today.  I do enjoy lettuce and tomato but for some reason I don't like them in my burger, specifically. I asked the server to make sure they don't include it and she acknowledged. When I got my Burger, I opened it to add some seasoning to it and found tomato and lettuce remnants in it. I picked it out and ate my Burger but it definitely tasted the heck out of what I didn't want in there, in there.  It comes down to laziness. They made the burger and noticed it's not the way I ordered it, and rather than saying ""we screwed up. Let's start over,"" they instead say ""oh crap. That wasn't supposed to be in there.... eh, just scrape the top bun and see if they notice."" It's fortunate with laziness like that that it wasn't an allergy issue because that could have been SERIOUSLY problematic for somebody. There is no reason any cook should prioritize their disinterest in doing their job over again (especially when they are paid by the hour, not the burger) over providing their guests with the great tasting experience they asked for and paid for. He not only robbed me of that satisfied experience, he also robbed me of the opportunity to brag on this about what a good job he (could have) did.  I tipped the waitress well anyway because again she wasn't the issue by any means. The scrapped food was an indication that the error was in fact not on her.

It wasn't busy at all, seated right away at the booth of our choice..  Our server was friendly and checked on us often..  They have a pretty large menu, mostly burgers.. And they are very accommodating to substitutions and special requests...  Their onion ring tower is pretty popular. Thick cuts of onion, came out hot. Comes with 2 dipping sauces.  Their pretzel bites were pretty good. The cheese sauce was a touch too running, I'd like the cheese to stick a bit more, but it had a nice subtle beer taste to it.  I got the bonsai burger this time around.. The patty is a nice juicy size.. And I like the teriyaki taste.. I didn't care too much for the pineapple though, a personal preference.. Husband got their special Oktoberfest burger, I forgot the exact name.. But it has sausage and candied bacon on it.. Any burger with their candied bacon is a score.. These burgers are a decent size and come with ""bottomless"" steak fries which can also he substituted for a healthier choice.. But I stuck with the steak fries and requested it to be ""extra crispy"" and it was just that, super crispy on the outside, soft inside.  Kids got the corn dog bites with fruit. Nice crunch to the batter.  We got a mud pie for dessert to share. That thing is big enough for 4... Basically a super rich chocolate ice cream cake. Very indulgent.

I was thinking they would over cook it but the cook did not over cook it. Ya ya.   Now as for the fries they were not over cooked that was a surprise as well and they were not bad tasting as well. The services this is always tricky one because some are good and bad now I did notes that they don't like to answer you when you call. I seen the manger walk by and he did not answer keep walking though that was odd then he came up a little later and ask how it was going. Ok that is just stupid.

The burgers were disgusting, falling apart all over the plate with the driest meat you've ever tasted and gross wilted lettuce. And the service was also horrendous. We had two waitresses both of whom were lazy and inattentive. They just kept bringing out plates and glasses with out ever taking any away, at one point we had six empty dirty plates and five empty dirty glasses on our table. Absolutely terrible.  In short, you'll get a better meal from a fast food joint. The food here sucks, and the staff is unbelievably LAZY. Never ever again. Go literally anywhere else.

Jennica S.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",639,405,1367,3.0,2/25/2015,"I've been to Red Robin about a handful of times in my life, not because of how amazing it is, but because I just want to go. Does that make sense? I don't crave it, per se, but if the name appears or a commercial plays, then I want to go. I don't think the advertisers are doing a good job... I just believe that I want to go because the gaps in between visits to this place are literally at least a year apart.  My favorite part about Red Robin is the unlimited strawberry freckled lemonade--it even comes in a cool cup! I would probably come here just for that drink, to be honest. Their burgers, though, let me talk about that... I'm going to speak about my latest experience because 1.) it was most recent and 2.) I don't really remember the other times. So, my boyfriend and I went to go here for linner (lunch-dinner) because I wanted a booger that wasn't too far from where we were. He had never gone either, so I thought ""Why not?"" I ordered the ""royal red robin"" because I saw it had egg, which I love, and he had the ""guacamole bacon"" because he didn't want to copy me (plus he wanted guac!)  Our server, who was a nice and attentive girl, asked us how we wanted our patty cooked--pink or no pink. I said, ""No pink,"" while he said the opposite. When our burgers came out, my boyfriend's burger was pretty cooked through, except for a minimal portion. He wasn't picky about it, but he wished it had been more pink. I liked my burger, though. The yolk broke all over it, which was yummy! I was disappointed in the amount of fries the both of us received. When I used to go here, I remember getting a lot a lot a lot of fries! Nowadays, it literally looks like there a 10 fries with my burger. I get that they're unlimited, but come on now... I can finish those fries in a minute. For $.99 more, i upgraded my steak fries to garlic herb fries.
