Hope W.,"Newnan, GA",49,21,65,5.0,7/9/2016,"Our party of four ate here for lunch at peak times on a busy Saturday and were very pleased! There wasn't a wait for seats, we were greeted promptly by the hostess and our waitress. Our server kept our drinks filled and checked on us appropriately. We ordered a refill on fries for one and received a quite adequate abundance of fries that everyone ended up sharing. They have implemented a mobile self serve at each table for appetizers, drinks and for checking out so you don't have to wait for your check. It also has a nifty call button for a server if you need anything. We used the call button feature once for being a newb with their system and the first server to pass (not our server) stopped to help out. Everyone was pleased with the quality and taste of their meals!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-newnan
Rusty Z.,"Atlanta, GA",1,41,1,1.0,1/5/2018,"It's like a bad movie about a dystopian future where overpriced fast food is hand delivered to your table by a waitress who only stops by when you call them from the tabletop kiosk and then charges you an ""entertainment fee"" for the visit.  Except it not a movie and it's not the future.    $15 for a pretty average burger?!  I was surprised because the menu is totally confusing.  There are three separate sections with burgers. Some repeat.  Some have prices. Some do not.  I finally narrowed it down to one that sounded like it was not smothered in sugar.  Wrong!  Pepper aioli was corn syrup based.  Oops. What was the $1.99 entertainment fee for?  If it were a ""cold draft from the window fee"" or an ""extra achy belly fee"" I'd understand. Then the tabletop kiosk that's supposed to make things faster wouldn't charge my card.  Had to press the ""call the waitress"" button again.  So an hour and a half later and a bit poorer I am finally done and regretting my visit.  The pain is beginning to set into my belly.  I'll probably spend the rest of the afternoon on the can.

Alicia L.,"Fayetteville, GA",33,137,343,2.0,3/17/2017,"I've driven past this place a million times. A friend of mine finally convinced me to stop because it was ""so good"".  I sat at the bar, the bartender Brooke seemed not so happy to be at work. She wasn't very attentive. I ordered the Black & Blue burger. It was good but not hot like it should have been when it came out. The bottomless fries were excellent!! The very raspberry limeade was 2 die 4 in my mind but my glass was filthy. I tried 2 take a pic but my phone kept cutting off. I began 2 feel like it was n the sink waiting 2 be washed & there wasn't time so she just used it any ole way. I lost my appetite after I kept looking at it. Before I left I used the bathroom. That shit was filthy too. The stalls were SUPER small & not designed very well.  After all that, will I go back? Probably not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-newnan

I've eaten almost everything on their menu and it is all terrible. Sorry for the dark review but I'm so sick of paying huge prices for ikea lunchroom food (ikea food better).

The general manager is a jerk and after getting him involved on what was going on, even HE couldn't get a simple cheese burger with no tomatoes right.

Howie S.,"Peachtree City, GA",0,7,1,1.0,8/13/2017,"First I want to say that my family has been coming here for years, since it opened. I have never had a bad experience here before today. My daughters 10th birthday was today and she requested to go here because of the food, and the Birthday treatment kids typically get here. First when we got here the place was only about a third full, if that. We had to stand at the host/hostess stand for a few minutes before anyone noticed us. Some guy came up wearing a dirty black tee shirt and eventually seated us. Right off we noticed that the place was filthy. The floors were nasty and several tables haven't been cleaned off. The place smelled very strongly of what I can only describe as dirty mop bucket water. Our server seemed as though she would rather be somewhere else and when told it was my little girls birthday and that she had specially requested to come to this place she seemed uninterested. She did ask if my little girl would like birthday ice cream, of course my little girl said yes. When we received our meals, my ciabatta bun for my burger was cut lop sidedly. The bacon on the burger was thin, brittle, and tasted like it had been sitting around a while. After we finish our meal we were hoping my daughter would receive her birthday ice cream. It never came, in fact the server came to our table did something with the kiosk, and turned it around towards us as if to say it was time to pay and go now. I don't usually give poor reviews but this was one occasion where I thought it was warranted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-newnan

Took over 5 mins to get service after we could get sat in a booth because it wasn't cleaned. Food was sub par, browned lettuce in the salad,the shredded lettuce on my burger was white didn't even look like lettuce. My pretzel bites tasted like onion rings.

Amy S.,"Alpharetta, GA",5,31,1,1.0,7/18/2017,"I had met a client and his wife for lunch today. We have been here before and it was always alright. Nothing spectacular mind you. I ordered the bonzai salad and I was nearing the end of what I could eat because those salads are huge anyway. The grilled chicken was sliced nicely and I took my fork, poked a piece and proceeded to eat it when immediately I noticed something wrong. A hair. Yes...a human hair, not a small one either. I'm guessing a long haired blonde. Embarrassed, I turned slightly as to pull the offending object from my mouth without my client seeing. We continued our conversation and the subject of ""what's wrong"" never came up. I didn't want to cause a scene or complain to the waitress in front of my client. However, as we left my client said, ""how about we go somewhere else next time?"" and I said, awesome idea!!! The waitress took forever to get our bill and I was dying to get out of there. I will not be back..needless to say, I lost my appetite and even now I can still recall that hair wrapped around my tongue and grossing me out!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-newnan

I had the avocado bacon burger and it was fantastic!  I had a difficult time finishing it, in fact I didn't!  The tower of onion rings we shared probably had something to do with that!

Dean H.,"Newnan, GA",6,33,,3.0,7/24/2016,The food is amazing but the soda drinks are really watered down. I asked for a coke and it was mainly water.

William L.,"Columbus, GA",3,10,2,2.0,7/13/2016,"I have long been a fan of Red Robin burgers.  However, after visiting the Newnan location with my wife, I was reminded of the old Wendy's commercial, ""Where's the Beef"".  Our regular burgers were flat and very thin. We showed them to our waitress and a manager.  Both agreed that they did not look right and even went to check the box to see if we were served mini burger pattys.  However, the final decision was just that it was now what they serve.  Why such a drastic change?  Sadly, we left feeling as if we had lost another old friend, as price has seemed to outweigh (or under weighed in this case), quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-newnan?start=20
Serah O.,"Grantville, GA",63,10,,1.0,2/28/2016,"My mother and I traveled to this location on the way back to our home in Alabama, we've heard that it's a good place to eat. It was our first time, mind you. How wrong were we? We had the double-double which means you get an appetizer and two burgers for $15.99. We got the spicy burgers that had jalapenos on it, and the whole nine yards. The burgers we had were not only disgusting, but not even real beef. They were overcooked and thin. What ever you guys want to call it, that paddy we both ate was NOT real beef.  We sat at the bar to eat, because we didn't want to wait 15-20minutes being on the tight schedule we had. It seems we waited on our server(which also happened to be the bartender) for more than 15 minutes for our check. He didn't seem to be bother with us since we weren't drinking alcohol. He never refilled our drinks, never did anything. Then tried to act like he did us a ""favor"" by saying they no longer did the double-double but ended up giving it to us. My parents eat at In-N-Out Burger all the time in California, THAT'S a real burger. What the hell did I just eat? Hope I don't get sick.

I had the Big Ghost burger which had great flavor and was really spicy. Which is nice except that I didn't get a refill on my water until I was in the process of paying the check.

Aaron W.,"Belle Chasse, LA",0,38,,2.0,2/28/2016,"First off, everything tasted great.  Our waitress worked her ass off.  The problem is that our order that included bottomless fries came with about the equivalent of a small fry at McDonald's.  Not exaggerating.  Immediately asked her to put in our refill order, and 10 minutes later an even smaller order of fries came out.  Now I am two orders in, been here for an hour and a half, and I'm less full than a normal burger meal at chili's.  I get that you don't want to waste food? But my 10 year old finished her 'adult' order of fries in a matter of a couple of minutes.  These poor waitresses are run ragged trying to constantly bring out 8-10 French fries at a time.  It's fairly pricey here.  Bring out a normal size order of fries on the first order, and I probably won't even ask for seconds.  After 2 orders (and over an hour waiting for them), I haven't had a 'normal' order yet, so I'm just annoyed and want to take it out on the poor waitress.   Sadly, won't be coming back.  Burger was small but tasted good.  Server was awesome, but service was terrible.  This place is busy, so I guess they won't care.  Not how I would run a place to keep people coming back.

The time the food was Great ,but the experience was aweful. We went on a weekday around early lunch time. There were hardly any customers in the restaurant. When we arrived there was no greeter at the front. It took 5 minutes before someone came to the front to greet us. And the lady tried to seat us in a booth right by the bathrooms, when no one was even there. It was plenty of seating in other areas and. I advised her that we would like to be seated somewhere else. The two waitresses that I saw were both dirty in appearance. There uniform shirts were dirty looking and our waitresses hair looked greasy and unkempt. As a employee you are representing the business and in food service you should want to look your best. You are servicing customers and presentation is everything.  But this wasn't the worst of it all. There was a couple behind us with a German shephard service dog. She asked if she could pet him.

Denise D.,"Punta Gorda, FL",15,185,80,4.0,1/13/2014,"I like Red Robin....I like the burgers and fries, but my favorite is the fried zucchini and mushroom appetizer. Love, love,love the 2 sauces that come with them. Service is prompt and my burger is always cooked perfectly. Nice pace to go before or after a movie.

Caitlin B.,"Ontario, CA",296,644,12,4.0,1/25/2013,"Yes, it's a chain, and I've eaten to Red Robins all over, but in my opinion, they have the best burgers out of any other ""chain"" I've eaten at here in Atlanta.   I wish they had more locations around the metro area, but I'll drive 30 minutes for an awesome burger!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-newnan?start=40
Mr. X.,"Fayetteville, GA",0,24,,4.0,3/27/2015,"Great place with great food. Can get packed quickly, so timing is key. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of five because they took the big sky burger off the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-newnan?start=40
Cody W.,"Griffin, GA",2,7,1,5.0,10/22/2012,"I enjoyed it. From the commercials it looked like a diner, but in reality it has dim lighting and stuff on the walls like Applebees. There is even a tv in the floor where you wait for a hostes, I guess for those who have the attention of a fly. Amusing nonetheless. The burgers were great, they all run about 10 bucks and come with bottomless steak fries. I had the chopsteak and my brother had the bleu, both had french fried onions on them, both made us wish they lasted longer. The soft drinks are 2.59 and were refilled about 6 times on our visit. The waitress patrolled her area like a hawk.  All in all a good time had by all. This is a fun pitstop for any burger lovers out there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-newnan?start=40
Ben L.,"LaGrange, GA",30,10,1,5.0,3/3/2012,"Honestly, the food quality and service deserves 4 stars. BUT, I gave them an extra star because they started carrying gluten free buns.

Stella K.,"Carrollton, GA",1,17,1,1.0,7/23/2013,"Yeah, plenty of empty parking spaces, a ton of empty tables, and they have *three* small parties of people waiting. Add that to the server who never worried about refills. Add that to the nearly-forty minute wait to be served. Add to that said server's refusal to bring the bill and package the late, wrong food as a to-go order. The best part: the manager's inability to find the table with the problem, and his combative attitude. Won't be going back to this mediocre establishment. Couldn't pay me to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-newnan?start=40
Donald O.,"Norcross, GA",18,21,2,5.0,4/16/2012,"Royal Robin Burger with bacon and egg is great a little  pricey but the endless fries and drink refills make up for it . Normally a good atmosphere unless their is a Child's birthday party going on,  large open area too loud  sometimes,  food is great but too much to pay for a ""Chucky Cheese"" atmosphere",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-newnan?start=40
Jeff O.,"Buckhead, Atlanta, GA",10,61,5,4.0,5/13/2012,"We've been to this particular Red Robin a few times. The service is generally OK, though it's slower than you would expect during peak times. The food is pretty good, and you do get quite a bit for your money - especially if you get the bottomless fries.

Danyel B.,"Newnan, GA",44,70,36,1.0,6/12/2014,My main reason for doing this review is to let the consumers know what happened to me. I signed up for their loyalty rewards program. They sent me a birthday coupon to use during the month of June expires at the end of the months. I don't normally eat here so I decided to call ahead to place my order I explained on the phone that I was using my Free birthday coupon. The told me ok it would be about 15 min. I waited in my car. When I went to the bar to get my order. The bar tender call the manager Jessica over. Jessica told her not to allow me to use my birthday coupon cause they have another promotion going on which was 20% off.  She stated that I had until the end of August to us the birthday coupon. I politely left the food and called back to get the general manger number. I explained to him that if they didn't want me to use the coupon they shouldn't have sent it to me. I felt like they should have told me that I could use it from the beginning when I placed my order. I will be back to get my free burger. And am not going back until they send me another free coupon. Manager Jessica you are so wrong on this one.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-newnan?start=40

Lisa K.,"Newnan, GA",0,9,3,3.0,12/15/2013,"The burgers are on the pricey side and they taste good but are not spectacular. Also at the store here in Newnan they will NOT bring you fries and campfire sauce automatically anymore, you have to ask and then there is only approximately 15 fries in the basket.

Brooke M.,"Atlanta, GA",297,88,,3.0,12/19/2011,"I could not wait until I sink my teeth into one of those burgers for the first time after I seen the commericals. The closest Red Robin is in Newnan which is 18 miles away. Ummm...it was a waste of gas. My family and I went there around 6pm on a Saturday in the spring and no customers were there. Weird. We sat down and I ordered the Blue Cheese burger. The burger was OK, NOT fanastic or original. The fries were good and of course was bottomless, but I didn't want any more. My family also thought is wasn't as great as people claimed. I'm not saying you shouldn't go there, but don't be expecting an orgasim in your mouth. I really wished I enjoyed it more....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-newnan?start=60

I have been wanting to try this place since I moved to Newnan. It did not disappoint. While the burgers were 10 dollars a piece....I was so excited after my first bite I can't even begin to tell you. The bread is truly perfect. The combo of toppings on the burger were awesome. Steak fries were great. Our server was awesome.

Jennifer W.,"Scott Air Force Base, IL",75,70,33,5.0,9/7/2010,"You can't go wrong with Red Robin.  This location is either busy or sort of dead, and very kid friendly.  (and I am comparing this location to a store just outside of Philadelphia).  I like the variety, the fact that you can substitute the burger for a vegetarian burger, and the option of getting veggies or fruit for the kids rather than the fries (because they're going to eat my fries anyways).  The staff at this location are always friendly and cheerful... and they always have balloons ;-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-newnan?start=60
