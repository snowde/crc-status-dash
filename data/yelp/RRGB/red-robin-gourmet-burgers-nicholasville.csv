Sarah R.,"Corbin, KY",46,37,,5.0,8/10/2016,"Tried Red Robin for the first time today and was not disappointed. My server Donna was friendly and knowledgeable. I ordered the new poutine fries appetizer with no aioli and a simple cheeseburger with cheddar on whole grain bun with bottomless fruit salad.  The food came out fast, hot,and delicious. The portions are big and you will not leave hungry.  Prices are higher than most other burger places but you get quality and more options for ingredients. I can't wait to try some of the other burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nicholasville?start=20
Tracy C.,"Lexington, KY",0,1,,2.0,10/29/2016,"In general, I love Red Robin, but not tonight. The floor was disgusting. We were seated at a table with french fries, wadded napkins, and straw wrappers under it. We weren't alone in this. I walked to the ladies room and every table I passed, occupied or not, had various debris under it. The food was good, and our server was very attentive, so at least two stars; but I lost my appetite looking around. No one was bussing tables either, there's just garbage everywhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nicholasville?start=20
Amy R.,"Lexington, KY",27,134,56,2.0,8/31/2015,"We were seated quickly and given our drinks right away. I ordered the Southern Charm Burger and my friend ordered the Royal Red Robin. Everything arrived pretty quickly, but the fries were cold, limp and inedible. We finally got a second look from the waitress AFTER we'd eaten our burgers and told her as much. She angrily asked why we didn't tell her and started taking our plates away while saying she was going to get us fresh fries. (We didn't tell YOU because you were with the girl behind the bar trashing someone else. Yea. We heard that.) We declined the fries and asked for a check. She brought it back without an adjustment and without apology.  Seriously beginning to think I could make a fortune in customer service training in this state.  The two stars indicate my appreciation for the burgers. They, at least, have a handle on that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nicholasville?start=20
Lynnsey M.,"Lexington, KY",15,16,1,1.0,6/11/2016,"The service was fine, but I believe the quality of food at Red Robin has diminished greatly. Before last night, it had been a few years since I had eaten there, but decided to give it a try since my fiancé is having surgery in a few days and is forbidden from consuming any carbohydrates (she liked the option of getting lettuce instead of bread). Anyway, while she was happy, I found my burger (The Burnin Love) to be bland and not Burnin. While nothing is ever usually spicy enough for me, this burger had zero spice. The fried peppers were flavorless, the salsa was flavorless, the bun (onion roll) was messy and pointless, and the actual hamburger seemed like it was a patty straight out of the freezer and defrosted. It was gross. Kudos for having some low carb options at a burger joint, but damn your food sucks.

C. G.,"Lexington, KY",0,5,,2.0,1/27/2017,"It appears Red Robin has changed the burgers they serve.  The two basic burgers served tonight appeared to be generic, preformed 1/4 lb patties.  They were small on the bun.  The dressings were pedestrian. For $8.99  each we were both very disappointed.  A better burger is available from fast food.  The BBQ chicken wrap was attractive, a nice proportion and tasty.  Service in the bar was good.  Total check $49.81 including 1 iced tea, one shake, one water and one draft beer was expensive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nicholasville?start=20

Kristina P.,"Lexington, KY",34,99,22,5.0,1/7/2016,"I don't review chain restaurants all too often - I figure the whole point of going to a franchised eatery is to know what to expect - but I just wanted to mention this particular location of Red Robin. This place has some really great service. Their servers have, to a one, been nice, upbeat and efficient. Their food is as advertised, delivered hot, and on the rare occasion something was not quite right, it was remedied quickly. I also appreciate their relatively late closing time for the area. Their burgers are dependably good and if you like steak fries, you'll not be disappointed. No doubt it won't impress the foodies as 5-star food overall, but in the world of Red Robins, this is a 5-star Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nicholasville?start=20

I'm not a huge fan of burgers, so I appreciate that you can sub chicken or a veggie burger for any of their burgers. You can also use their app to customize your meal and calculate the nutrition, which is very handy. My favorite dish is the Bruschetta Chicken Sandwich but when I eat lighter, I go with the Simply Grilled chicken Sandwich. Their bottomless fries are GREAT! I haven't tried the sweet potato ones yet, but we love the originals.

Decent hamburger but really frozen fries are not expected in what I think is suppose to be an upscale hamburger restaurant I would suggest you stop bottomless frozen fries and go to a fresh fry. I suggest you sample a burger and fries at burger fi, they really are a huge step up in fresh fries and your gourmet burger has too much sauce it was sloppy.

Tim E.,"Lexington, KY",5,196,43,3.0,12/27/2015,"Joined the reward club and get special offers, went back for a free birthday burger.  I picked the burger with the egg with an extra charge for onion rings. - burger was good.  Was with two other diners one had  cheeseburger and fries , the other ordered burger with sweet potato fries (spf) also an extra charge. Well the spt fries were COLD, so asked for more, second order - also COLD, third time were a little bit warmer but not by much.The refills on fries were not quick on comming out.  I would recommend stick to the fires or onion rings. Cold fries have been mentioned in several reviews.  The fries are unlimited, o-rings are not.  There is new decor here, different items on the wall, and the tables and chair look different  There is now an ipad on the table that you can call waitress, and pay your bill, also has trivia, for you guessed it a 1.99 extra charge.   The bill for 3 with a free burger was still $30 dollars as i said in my first review, it is a pricey place to have a hamburger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nicholasville?start=20

Katie F.,"Lexington, KY",11,100,346,4.0,6/30/2017,"Before my last time at Red Robin it had been ages so I was last there. My husband and I went a couple of weeks ago and really liked it! We love that they have bottomless fries and had really great service this past time.  Our waiter was amazing!! We got a meal to split and without us even asking, he brought it out on 2 plates and gave us each our own basket of fries. He was super friendly and just very attentive.  We also tried a Pina Colada and it was delicious. I feel like a lot of times at restaurants they use the pre-frozen mixes for these but you could tell that Red Robin makes their own in house and makes it super creamy!!  RR is a little on the pricey end but what can you expect for bottomless fries?!?!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nicholasville

David G.,"Lexington, KY",65,151,177,3.0,3/5/2017,"Let me start out by saying that I don't fully get the gourmet chain burger idea. There are tons of great local burger restaurants in the city that charge a fraction of the cost of Red Robin with much better tasting burgers. The fact that Red Robin doesn't participate in Lexington Burger Week should indicate something to all of us. That said, I have to admit I like something about the ambiance in here. Can't exactly put my finger on what it is, but something puts me at peace in this joint. And that's a good thing, because the service is slow. It takes a really long time to get your meal. So you'd better enjoy the wait. Unfortunately, I ordered the Peppercorn Burger (waitress' recommendation), and the wait wasn't rewarded with an awesome burger. It wasn't cold, but very cool. It didn't have a lot of flavor to it ~ I'd call it close to unseasoned. The fries were pretty good, though.  They claim the fries are bottomless and the drink refills are endless, but let me give you the caveat. You need the waitress to get them for you. If she ain't around, there's nothing endless or bottomless to it. I was actually wondering at one point if they train them to avoid you after they've delivered your meal.  So, if you want to pay premium prices for ok burgers, have at it. This might be your place. The fries are good. I like the ambiance. The kids' meals are only $4.99. It ain't all bad in here. But, you go there for the burgers. And they're just average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nicholasville
Tina L.,"Lexington, KY",1,100,240,5.0,8/12/2017,My kids love their mac & cheese and we love that its bottomless! They have my favorite fries ever! Gluten free options are always a plus!

Chad C.,"Lexington, KY",425,823,1603,4.0,5/10/2017,"I usually go to this Red Robin after volleyball games with my team.  It is usually later in the day and the place is not really crowded at all.  The wait staff is always helpful and friendly.  I love the fact they aren't afraid to give their opinion when asked.  I do that often.  I ask the waitstaff, if they were going to order....what would they get?  This is a great thing I have learned years ago.  That lets you know whats really good even to the staff.  Try it some time. The salads are good, the burgers are great...I can only have so many of those fries with seasoning and parm all over them.  I love their lemonades which are hand made.  I recently found out that I love their Mile High Mudslide.  Its a slice of ice cream cake slice meant for multiple people, but I have to say that I made it a one person meal. NOM NOM. The location of the place is half way between Nicholasville and Lexington.  If you are in the area, stop by and see them.  Please note it is a laid back place and they aren't about being in a hurry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nicholasville

Carlos H.,"Lexington, KY",8,42,,1.0,1/8/2017,"We were excited about trying Red Robin again for the first time in at least 2-3 years and going to a movie following lunch. The last time we went to Red Robin, we were not overly impressed with the food, and I experienced digestive problems following the visit. However since our last visit years ago, my brother and his family had raved about their excellent experiences at this location. So, we decided to give it another try. We will not return to this restaurant again. The fries were excellent and the service was decent. Oh, and our daughter's corn dogs appeared to be OK. However, my hamburger was undercooked. I made it very clear that I wanted NO PINK in my hamburger. Unfortunately, at least part of my hamburger reminded me of the nearly-raw hamburgers my great-aunt's husband used to serve up every summer at his house in Georgia. The main reason we will not return to this restaurant is because of what my wife has gone through for the last 12 hours. As a family that doesn't eat out every day, it's pretty easy for us to identify the cause. At least Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was even better the second time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nicholasville
Heather P.,"Lexington, KY",1368,1368,6019,2.0,6/9/2016,"Sometimes they only get one chance to wow me and this place blew it. Honestly, I thought it was more of a fast food or fast casual type of place, it's not. It's a sit down restaurant that I wouldn't recommend if you're on a lunch break or in a hurry. I ordered a basic burger and one would think that a place that prides themselves or claims to have ""gourmet burgers"", that it would be something more than what it was. Actually it came out cold and the bun was soggy. It had obviously been sitting awhile before it was brought out to me. After waiting 45 minutes, I was hesitant to send it back, but if I'm going to splurge the calories for a burger, I want to enjoy it. The manager apologized but was a bit odd about it. Don't ask me ""what do you want me to do? Is half off ok?"" That's just odd, I just wanted a burger, I'm not going to tell you or ask you to take $$ off. After another 20 minutes of waiting for the replacement burger, I came close to walking out, but I roughed it out and I must say that second time around was much better, just not what I would call ""gourmet"". The steak fries are bottomless, but not very good IMO.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nicholasville
Cindy H.,"Pigeon Forge, TN",14,7,,1.0,4/12/2017,"One of the worst burgers I've ever had.  I got the traditional bacon cheeseburger (no tomato but I got that too) and it was so soggy from the grease, the bottom bun was just...wet.  The patty itself was the thin pre-pressed frozen kind I could have gotten at Sam's.  My lone bite revealed nothing special about the flavor.  Their only saving grace was the Garlic Herb Fries which were actually pretty good.  Others at my table had the same experience from their meals.....the sides were better than the burgers!  The server was aggrivatingly helpful to the point of turning the menu pages for those that didn't follow instruction fast enough.

It was my coworker's first time at a red robin and he couldn't believe how amazing it was! He said they officially gained a fan. The burgers were hot and juicy. The fries were hot, crisp, and bottomless!  The only issue I felt we had was standing there for 5 minutes to be seated. But there was only one guy there seating people. The manager came over and saw us and was such a super nice guy that I believe he honestly cares about his customers.

The broccoli, a goodly portion. was simply steamed.  I refrigerated it for later use.   The sandwich was pretty decent, certainly better than I expected from a place of this caliber.  To me, it's a quasi-fast food place -- and I'm still a food snob.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nicholasville

Gene T.,"Lexington, KY",0,7,,1.0,8/27/2016,"My family of 5 has been visiting Red Robin (this location and, before that, one in Cincinnati) for at least the last dozen years or so.  I think we're finally done.  Here is a copy of an email I sent to RR corporate regarding our latest, and last, visit.  The only response from corporate was a ""thanks for your feedback"" email.  No attempt to save us as a customer, nothing. ""Just had to drop a note to describe the horrible experience we had last night at this Red Robin location. We've been eating at Red Robin for over 12 years and this is only the second time I've ever been prompted to write about an experience we've had that's made my family question ever going back. To summarize our negative experience, in no particular order:  - Was seated promptly but at a table that had extreme light reflecting off cars in the parking lot. We asked if blinds could be closed but were told, ""They don't go down any farther."" So, we asked to be moved. Hostess moved us to the adjacent table...with the same issue. The amount of light reflecting towards these tables was obvious, so why would the hostess even seat anyone at those tables until the sun went down further?  - After being seated no server came by for over 10 minutes.  - We were a table of 4. Table of 7, immediately behind us, got their entire order fully 5 minutes before we did...and we were there 15 minutes before they were!  - Our kids wanted to play games on the game pads at our tables (hostess had to scoot two tables together, so each came with a game pad). We couldn't get either game pad to work. Both had error message, ""We want you to have fun (but you need to order your drinks first)."" We kept asking server about it, she said she'd ""check on it"", but never did. By the time the food came we gave up...no time left for kids to play games at that point. So, we just wanted to give Red Robin another $2.00 (to play gamepad) but couldn't do so.  - Bottom of buns on my and my youngest child's burgers were burnt. We didn't say anything to server. We just wanted to leave by that point.  - Wanted to order a beer. Server had no idea what draft beers were available and left to check. After 10 minutes I just walked to the bar and ordered my own beer to bring back to the table. Server never acknowledged that I had to get my own beer, even after I asked her for another!  - All 4 meals literally came with 4-5 fries. We were told they were cooking more so we asked for more when available. They never came. Again, at that point we just wanted to leave. So much for ""bottomless"" fries.  - When placing order asked waitress for sides of ""campfire"" sauce and the in-house ""hot ketchup"". She literally said, ""If I write it down it will confuse them in the kitchen, so remind me after your food comes."" We gave up and never said another word about it.  - Had to ask for refills every time...was never asked if we wanted any.  - If manager had stopped by our table once we would have mentioned our concerns to her. She didn't. We did, however, watch her sitting at a table talking with another employee for most of our time at the restaurant.  - Finally, when it came time to pay, I laid my credit card on the table and the server said, ""You'll need to use the pad for that."" I replied, ""I'd like to but both give an error message (as I detailed earlier when talking about how my children wanted to play games on the pad)."" Server said, ""They do those all the time,"" and took both pads away. Five minutes later she said neither pad was on the right table. After another few moments she found the ""right"" pads (one of which was clear on the other side of the restaurant) and asked me to use one of them to pay. Exasperated and ready to leave I said, ""Can't you just process our credit card?"" She said she couldn't and asked again that we use the pad. Really??  In short, we used to have pretty relaxing experiences at Red Robin. This time was anything but and it will be quite a while before we return, unfortunately. Employees clearly need additional customer service training at this location.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nicholasville

We thought the first time it was perhaps a fluke so we gave it another go,  it seems that the poor service is something they may have issues with.   If you have time to waste,  the food is okay but somewhat over-priced. If you're in a bit of a time crunch or don't want to play Russian roulette on getting a good server,  pick someplace else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nicholasville
Michael M.,"Lexington, KY",38,63,101,3.0,7/22/2015,"My wife had a coupon for a free birthday burger from Red Robin so we decided to make that our dinner destination. While our first visit (approximately two years ago) failed to turn us into regulars, it didn't turn us against the place either.  Maybe we had ordered the wrong dish. This time around we decided to share two gourmet burgers: the Bleu Ribbon and the Chili Chili Cheeseburger. First the positives... for one of our sides we chose onion rings and they were made from scratch and delicious! On the other hand the Garlic Parmesan steak fries were bland as Hell. The seasoning  blend must have been sprinkled on after the oil had dried because it didn't stick at all. Even though the sweet and spicy ketchup was a nice change of pace, it couldn't redeem this boring side dish. As for the burgers, the patties were thin and completely lacking seasoning. So to recap: too much bun, not enough beef, zero flavor. One last thing, the chili on the Chili Chili Cheeseburger had black beans in it. I'm sorry but if you're adding chili to a hotdog or burger it needs to be a no-bean chili, and certainly not black beans. I'd give a score of 2 & 1/2 stars if that was an option, but it's not, so I'll round it up to three. One last thing, the soft drinks were watered down. Probably won't go back until Erica's birthday rolls around again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nicholasville
Jack E.,"Nicholasville, KY",46,62,184,4.0,3/14/2016,"I'm more of a plain burger kinda guy but they do have a great variety for you messy burger eaters. They advertise bottomless steak fries but what they don't tell you is that you can swap other unlimited sides if you'd like.  You can get unlimited House Salad, Steemed Broccoli, or Cole Slaw, pretty good deal.  The onion rings are pretty great too. We tried a couple deserts (Brownie Sticks and Cronut Tower, both limited time offerings.) and weren't impressed with either.  Over all this is a good place to eat and they have a good loyalty program so don't forget to sign up for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nicholasville
Lee P.,"Winchester, KY",54,597,1418,3.0,2/23/2011,"You don't go to Red Robin for an amazing hamburger, you go there for exotic burgers. It has a wide selection of interesting burgers you probably won't find anywhere else. Very flavorful and enjoyable.  The best burger here, the Whiskey River BBQ burger.  Couple that with all you can eat fries.  A few negatives about Red Robin is that they tend to be quite busy on weekends so you may have to wait a while to be seated. Also, their prices may be a little on the high side when it comes to burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nicholasville?start=40
Kris R.,"Nicholasville, KY",20,50,324,3.0,4/11/2014,National chain restaurant with good burgers and steak fries.  I have been to this location many times and typically the service is adequate and the food is hot and tasty.  My favorite burger is the Royal Red Robin.  This burger includes an egg and has a good mixture of flavor.  Note that you can trade out your burger bun with no upcharge and the ciabatta role is a wonderful compliment to this burger.  Bottomless steak fries also keep me coming back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nicholasville?start=40
Cindy S.,"Nicholasville, KY",0,2,,1.0,8/15/2015,"If there was an option for zero stars that's what I'd pick for the Brannon Crossing Red Robin. My husband and I, with our 4 month old in a car seat, were waiting to be seated. Four - yes four - employees were huddled around the seating chart trying to figure out where to seat us. In the meantime, three other groups of 2 or 4 came in after us and were seated right away - right in front of us. I was so angry - we left!  We can sit at a table for 2, 4 or a booth just fine.

Olivia B.,"Bloomington, IN",47,438,30,1.0,7/26/2013,"I usually don't review national food chains: making an exception (bc of *). Have eaten here 12+X (usually in bar area, if alone) when I'm trapped locally for work (2010 - ). As others noted: no alcohol (even beer / wine) on Sundays. Chain is all about burger toppings / combinations, w/ seasonal / special offerings.  None standout, though, because (at least at this location) they don't season their beef while / after it's cooked.  Yep, that's right: no salt, no pepper.  Every. Single. Burger. I've. Had.   Second, for the love of G*d, make sure to switch out the ""regular"" bun. By the time it comes out from the kitchen, the bottom is soaked thru with foul grease. They don't toast their buns, so only the more substantial buns fare well. Next: the civilized world has agreed on a system for describing how they want their red meat prepared.  There's rare & medium rare (which would be understandable for a restaurant to refuse to serve), there's medium, medium-well, & well.  THERE IS NOT ""NO PINK"" & ""PINK"".  If your customers are so effing stupid that they can't order a burger properly, why on earth would you think that this binary (still entirely unseasoned) option would result in any greater satisfaction in what was served? Prob 4: Bottomless steak fries are damn near inedible (no matter what you season them with yourself).  I've ordered them a good half dozen times & have seen what others I've eaten with have been served  They're NEVER properly fried, they're meally & soft (never crisp), unseasoned, and just, frankly a waste of my effing gym time.  I have never, ever, in the course of at least a year, asked or seen anyone ask for more fries. They're effing terrible.  Prob 5: Mac&cheese side is literally cooked (plain) spiral pasta with a sprinkle of cheese over the top.  Was stunned to discover, as I knew I was paying $1.50 upcharge for what amounted to a nickle's worth of plain pasta covered in no more than fifteen cents worth of [pre-shredded] cheddar, in a little dish.  Effing VILE. Prob 6: Each of the 10 or so times I've decided to eat at the bar, the same bartender* is working.  She's* always training some new employee like a wee little lamb (note: I've never seen any of the folks she's* trained actually working there on subsequent visits), which means I get to overhear far more than I'd prefer about Red Robin corporate, marketing, upselling, and whatnot.  Am guessing not all that is communicated is ""corporate-sanctioned."" Prob 7*: Queen bee's* service is spotty at best.  She* appears entirely solicitous...except she* disappears (and none of the other employees present in the bar area will provide service if she* isn't there, directing them explicitly to do so and supervising) for fifteen - twenty minute periods, fairly regularly.  Understand that an employee's attention may be needed elsewhere, but when other employees will literally make eye contact with a diner trying to request something, look down, then look away and continue to follow the game on tv...That's some bullshit. Prob 8*: I've worked in restaurants.  I understand both the well-intentioned & manipulative desire to return change to facilitate being adequately to well-tipped.  What I don't understand is making EFFING STUPID change for diners who have not requested such.  I swear to X, every time I dine at the bar (again, same ""Queen Bee*"" as the official ""server,"" I have never received  change including a bill greater than a $5. That includes the time I stopped in a had a beer while watching a football game and only had a $50 and the time I paid for dinner for one with a bill.  This nitwit* literally gave me 25$ in 1$ and fives in change, and 45$ in $1 and 40$ in $5.  Not once, after picking up my payment has this woman* said, ""Oh, sorry, been a slow day, only had small change...Is that ok or would you rather charge?""  Instead, I end up with an effing stripper wad, for no effing good reason, after I've tipped well over 20% (despite bs). Dear Queen Bee* (Yeah, you're probs 9 & 10): You're not actually that great a server.  You're pushy.  You're far, far more focused on pushing your weight around with the servers,  training & assessing the poor pups who are assigned to you than actually serving customers, who aren't actually interested in hearing about corporate or how to make a blah, blah, blah, or whatever.  You disappear.  If you can't tone it down, at least turn the tvs up, since we're the ones your tips come from.  I used to think that this place had an empty bar because it was in Jessamine County, so folks weren't sure of the serving policies.  At this point, I'm pretty sure it's because you'd be the assistant manager all the servers and kitchen staff hate...and frankly, as a customer, I'd rather not deal with you either.  Grow a social skill, for X-sake.  Even just the one would be a mitzvah. & STOP giving me stupid change.

Aaron V.,"Travelers Rest, SC",70,48,,4.0,12/8/2012,"Have stopped here with the fam on a number of occasions on the way home from church.  All in all it's usually been a nice experience.   My two favorite things on their menu are the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken and the Prime Chophouse burger.   Here's a tip: the bottomless fries also come in a parmesan/garlic variety for no extra charge but this is NOT on the menu.  Don't ask me why.  I love them even though they leave me thirsty for the rest of the day.  Worthy it, tho.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nicholasville?start=40

April B.,"Lexington, KY",9,12,,2.0,8/22/2013,"We were seated right away on a Thursday evening. It took forever for the waitress to take our order after we were brought our drinks. I ordered the guacamole burger (bunless) and a side of black beans. My burger came out cold with cheese that was not melted, along with a huge portion of lettuce wrapped around a not very substantial size of meat, especially for the ridiculous price. I was less than impressed. The beans tasted sweet to me and were not good, they were also luke warm. My husband had a burger on a gluten-free bun that he really enjoyed, he said the bun was very tasty. I tasted his fries, and they were not seasoned at all, very plain and a bit undercooked. My daughter had a pizza that was undercooked.

They can't serve it because they're in Jessamine county.  Second. The manager totally ignored us when she went checking on the dining experiences of everyone else around us. I felt discriminated against either because my friend with me has a lot of tattoos or because we looked too butch or something. We couldn't figure out why.

They even have gluten free buns (surprisingly delicious ones, I'm told!)! However, the type of service you get (and whether or not your fries are actually gluten free) depends on your server.
