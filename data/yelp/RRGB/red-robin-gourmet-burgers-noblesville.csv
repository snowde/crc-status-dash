Matt B.,"Palm Coast, FL",0,8,,2.0,4/15/2017,Burger was good all thought it took a while to get. Asked for more of the bottomless fries and I'm still waiting for them.

Ragnar A.,"Kalkaska, MI",59,19,26,3.0,11/9/2015,Came to this RR for lunch  Was not busy and we still waited more than 40 minutes for two salad orders.  My wife had to send hers back due to some kind of hair.  Mine chicken was not warm.  The send breast was actually chewy like it wasn't fully cooked.  Left part of it on the plate.  No happy.   The manager and server were nice They did promptly my wife's salad We won't be back Were on the road and can't stop for hours.   Very bummed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-noblesville?start=20

Katie R.,"Indianapolis, IN",177,180,19,3.0,10/18/2014,"Brought the kids here for an early (4:45 p.m.) Saturday dinner.  I was surprised to discover they don't have wifi---so the iPad I'd brought along was no use.   Our server was pleasant and brought drinks quickly.  Our food didn't take an extremely long time to arrive despite how busy it was, but I'm basing my three stars on the food:  my daughter's grilled cheese was black on one side.  I could have sent it back, but once our food arrived, I didn't see our server for a long time.  The side order of broccoli was one floret in a sauce cup, and the unlimited fries thing doesn't really work if you can't find anyone to ask for more. We'll probably give it one more shot.  I do like that it's family friendly and loud, and that the kids get balloons on the way out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-noblesville?start=20

I got the Southern Charm gourmet burger and WOW!! It was cooked just how I asked for it and was really delicious. My husband got Guacamole Bacon burger and it also was great! The sweet potato fries were not hot and didn't taste fresh, but the regular fries were fine.

Lots of well behaved younger kids. THANK YOU PARENTS!! MOLLY was our server both times. First time by default and the second time by choice. She was the first one to ever offer to refill our fries. We have visited 6 different locations so we were surprised at the offer even though that is part of their advertising. Burgers, fries and onion rings were all very good.

Elizabeth C.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,5,,1.0,8/17/2015,"Red Robin used to be a family-favorite restaurant if not for anything else but for a great atmosphere and the kids like the bottomless mac'n'cheese and fries. The rest of the menu is overwhelmingly consistent, but you don't go there for the world's best burger or anything else. That said, since the recent re-branding of Red Robin we returned twice, and have been disappointed both times.  The first is the issue with the kids' bottomless mac'n'cheese, which is no longer an option. On our first visit, the mac'n'cheese was cold and because my kids anticipated a second bowl, they scarfed down the first bowl only to be told that the second bowl was not an option.  The only thing they were happy about was the bottomless fries, only to find about ten steak fries in the bowl and which were gone rather quickly. They didn't want to appear as gluttons so they didn't ask for more. My issue was with the sweet potato fries -- supposedly an upgrade. The serving size was smaller and they, too, were cold. We returned last night with friends and the same issue presented itself. The strawberry lemonade was served in a glass with so much ice that there were literally two sips in the glass before it needed to be refilled. I felt sorry for our server for having to return to the table four times to refill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-noblesville?start=20
Rachael B.,"Pendleton, IN",3,16,2,5.0,8/13/2015,I love Red Robins. My favorite appetizer is the pretzel bites with cheese. Their onion rings are a good starter as well.  I'm not normally a burger girl but I love their Whiskey River Barbecue burger cooked medium. Their fries are thick cut but you can substitute them for onion rings if you do not like that.  They have a pretty good dessert menu but many of the desserts are too big for one person so be careful.  The atmosphere is noisy and sometimes feels a little chaotic but the bar area is quieter. They are great for kids and groups.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-noblesville?start=20

Bettnie M.,"Noblesville, IN",43,18,,1.0,4/25/2014,"Inconsistent, dirty & poorly mannered and those are probably their stronger suits.  We eat here probably once a month and although I'm never sure if my food will be good, let alone hot, tonight's dinner was the worst experience I have ever had there.  We waited a half hour for the bar even though there were several tables in that section. To make it worse we ended up getting seated in the family dining next to the kitchen. (I'm a teacher and many of my students and their families frequently eat there and I deserved drink after this week.) The snotty hostess wouldn't move us, so there went that earned adult beverage.  As I was waiting for my water, I watched in HORROR as waiters put their fingers IN TO people's drinks and food. I was near nauseous by the time my cold, dried up food got there.

Tim W.,"Indianapolis, IN",46,164,78,2.0,12/13/2011,"I like Red Robin. I like THIS Red Robin. I love their onion rings. These breaded delights are the perfect onion rings. However, the server we had, Nick made the experience tonight much less than it could have been. First, Nick had an attitude. Whenever you'd ask or tell him something, the answer was ""I know,"" or some equivalent that let you know he was above you. We had a table of 13 people for my mom's birthday. Maybe server Nick is superstitious and that's why we had such bad service.  Next, Nick required us to do all his work for him. He could never remember what everyone ordered to eat or drink so every visit to our table for Nick was a series of questions about what we were eating or drinking. He'd approach the table with drinks or food and ask us to hand them across the table to someone else instead of walking around the table. There was plenty of room for him to do this so that shouldn't have been a problem.   I ordered the onions rings and specified them as an appetizer and reminded Nick I wanted them before the rest of the food arrived. He answered, ""I know,"" and even talked me into getting two orders of onion rings to share with the entire table. Our food arrived with no onion rings as an appetizer or even to go with the food. When I asked server Nick about it, he said, ""I know. I forgot to place the order."" No, Nick, you did NOT know. You didn't place the order. I cancelled the onion rings.  When the food arrived, one of the people at our table had no food. When we brought that to server Nick's attention, he said, ""I know. I forgot to put the order in."" Clearly, server Nick has a different understanding of the meaning of the phrase, ""I know"" because he didn't seem to know much. The guest who had no food asked if his fries could be garlic fries since server Nick was going to place the order for the first time. Server Nick assured us that the fries would be garlic fries. Not surprisingly, the fries, when they finally arrived, were NOT garlic fries. We had to wait for drink refills many times. And the bottomless order of fries that is supposed to come with every meal? Never arrived. We got the fries we ordered and no more. The food was good. The experience wasn't.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-noblesville?start=40

Seemed a little high. I will say I was very impressed with the kids meal choices, I've never seen such a nice variety, even the pickiest of kids should be able to find something. Our server was nice but the food runner failed to take our kids plates away that we were keeping from them so they wouldn't throw them so we were hanging out for a while holding plates and trying to eat.

Our waitress, SavannahK, was very energetic and took care of getting our drink order right away. They offer a 32oz mug of draft beer so I decided to have a very large beer to cap off a busy Friday.  I had Blue Moon and since it was so big, they automatically garnished it with 2 large orange wedges. I then ordered the BBQ burger. When it came, the burger looked great but there weren't many fries on the plate. I immediately asked for additional fries.

Jackson L.,"Greenwood, IN",24,83,36,3.0,3/23/2017,"Red Robin is a pretty decent choice for burgers. They're definitely nothing special, the bottomless fries are unnecessary, but if you just want a place that makes a good beef patty and puts it on a bun, they're here for you.  I still have to say that while I was excited the first time I went, subsequent visits have been a little less impressive each time. Today, I thought I'd go a little off-script and choose a non-traditional burger offering. Now, I love burgers. If I could only eat one thing for the rest of my life, it would be a burger. So when I say off-script, I mean it. Maybe I was in a rut here. Maybe something out of the ordinary was required to reimpress me. I chose the Citrus Harissa Salmon burger, a bold new option on the Gourmet Burger page.  I should have chosen differently.  I happen to also love salmon, but this really did not work. The fish flakes too much to be between two stiff buns. It just ended up as mush and fell out the sides. The aioli was far too thick for something as light tasting as salmon, so the whole thing ended up as an overly flowery, complicated mess that I finished with a fork. The fish was good alone. I was surprised it was as well cooked at a place that doesn't specialize in seafood. But the dish as a whole, with the exception of the addition of arugula to the sandwich (perfect choice, chefs), was a disappointment.  None of this is nearly enough to make me stop going. This is a place that, in my experience, consistently delivers what you expect going in, assuming you're already familiar. It's worth a try if you've never gone, and it's a solid choice to keep on the back burner if you run out of options. Sometimes there are a lot of unchecked kids running amok in the waiting area, but the restaurant attracts families, and I enjoy that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-noblesville

Marley W.,"Anderson, IN",20,101,125,1.0,7/23/2017,"Slow service, long wait to seat and longer to get food, noisy, greasy cold food and a screwed up check to top off a bad experience.  Will not return if I can avoid it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-noblesville
Abby Z.,"Noblesville, IN",2,58,17,1.0,12/26/2016,What an absolute mess. They have 2 hostesses and 1 server in the bar?? We waited 15 minutes for a table at the bar and watched other people walk in and seat themselves? I asked and this bar is not open seating. We then had a rude waitress walk by and say she needed to see our IDs and then walk off. We then waited another 15 minutes for her to come back to get our order and check our IDs and that never happened!! She instead took orders for 3 tables that sat themselves after us. We walked out and went to McDonalds for better service.  This is not the first ridiculous experience we have had here but it will be the last.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-noblesville
Catie M.,"Kokomo, IN",0,23,,5.0,4/5/2017,This is my go to place to celebrate birthdays with friends and family. The service is always amazing even when they are crazy busy! Vivian is the best! She always makes sure we are well taken care of and has no problem helping any picky eaters or first timers find something that they end up loving.  Food is always perfect and delicious.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-noblesville
Michelle B.,"Fishers, IN",0,1,,1.0,8/28/2016,"We have gone to this location several times and it has gone downhill.  We waited a very long time for our food and when it arrived it was cold.  A table that was sat 15 min after us got their food at the same time and we didn't order any apps just meals.  The only positive was the manager took care of our bill.  He said he would talk to the kitchen and find the mistake/issue but never came back.  Very disappointing service. Also, when we got seated our table bench was dirty and thankfully my daughter just missed it as she got into the seat as it was ketchup.  Later we saw the bus lady cleaning tables and when she cleaned the booths in the corner she was standing on the seats to clean the table and clear the dishes, then didn't wipe down the seats clean which is absolutely disgusting given she had walked all around that restaurant.   This location used to be good but our last few visits have been terrible, cold food and poor service.  Now it appears the cleanliness is an addition to the above.  We won't be going back, we have given them enough time and chances to improve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-noblesville
Bill D.,"Tampa, FL",0,17,,2.0,1/1/2017,Service is lacking food overall is fair. 5 guys is better and the same price. This is a burger chain that tries to dress up burgers but they are not doing that great of a job doing it . Been here 3 times and always go mr-med and all 3 times burger is well done.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-noblesville
Rob C.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,4,,2.0,4/10/2016,"My family and I have tried this Red Robin location several times in the past year. ""Fool me once"" I suppose. We have given them the benefit of the doubt (as we usually enjoy Red Robin), and though the next closest location is twice as far from our home, it would appear that we will have to make the trek if we want Red Robin going forward. This location has awful service. We have gone when it's busy, when it's dormant, and in-between. Regardless, you will wait at least 45 minutes before you see so much as a French Fry. God help you if you want refills, you'll be looked at like an insane person - if you ever get one. Furthermore, we have yet to get napkins and or utensils without first asking in any of our several visits (who needs napkins anyway?) The staff is usually rude...even when you are trying to be understanding and fair to their plight as service employees. I can only imagine how they treat customers who are actually rude back towards them.  In short. Red Robin is good. This location is not. Avoid it if at all possible. The only reason for 2 stars, rather than 1, is it is still technically Red Robin...yum.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-noblesville
Chase R.,"Fortville, IN",95,1,,5.0,7/21/2016,"GREAT STAFF!!!!!  Our server Matthew was so kind and was always refilling our drinks and fries. Food was hot, fresh, and delicious. This is my new favorite American restaurant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-noblesville
T R.,"Greenwood, IN",0,3,2,1.0,7/2/2017,"All I can say is yuck.  Food was not good.  I ordered my burger well done and it was pink.  Apparently, I received the ""bottom of the basket"" portion of fries with the leftover bits and hard pieces.  Honestly, the frozen ones you can buy at Krogers are better.  We have frequented Red Robins in AZ and never have had this problem.  Bad ownership or management?  What a waste of money today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-noblesville

Sean H.,"Fishers, IN",117,146,83,1.0,2/16/2014,"The only thing consistent at this restaurant is the it is awful. It is dirty, they are slow uninformed staff and the food is cold. I am taking this place off my list for good. I've been coming here for a long time always hoping they will get it together as many Red Robins I've been to are great however this one lacks even the most standard of standards",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-noblesville
Brit P.,"McCordsville, IN",44,85,40,2.0,8/20/2016,"We all know the caliber of food at Red Robin, so this review isn't about the food. Maybe it's because I used to be a waitress, but poor service really gets to me. We were seated in the bar area. For a Friday night, it was really pretty bare in the restaurant. We sat at our table for a solid 10 minutes with nary a glance our way from any of the Red Robin staff. It wasn't until my friend pressed the ""call server"" button, and our machine started blinking red (but couldn't actually call the server because our table hadn't been programmed in to the computer yet) that someone noticed us. The host came by, said he would be back, and left. About 5 minutes later, our server arrives. He kind of apologized. He said no one told him he had a table, and management had let another server go for the night, so he didn't know this table was his. ""Sorry for the confusion"". Ok, fine. We order our drinks and food. Don't see him again. Someone else brings the drinks, someone else brings the food. The food took an extremely long time to come out. When it got to our table finally, the fries were cold. Cold fries are the worst! I'd also like to mention the whole time it's like we're sitting in the arctic. It was seriously freezing in there. My friend said something to our waiter about how cold the restaurant was. It was so cold you could almost consider it uncomfortable. He told her ""I can get my manager, but there's nothing he's gonna do about it"". And then proceeds to tell us that the dehumidifier is broken, so if they don't keep the air on full blast, condensation forms on the floor. I guess the floors were so wet, someone fell. So, now this system. The manager apparently had a timer on his phone, and every 45 minutes he would turn the air off in order to warm the place up a bit. Know what's worse than being freezing? When they turn the air all the way off, and you have stale restaurant air not moving around the building, and 98% humidity. Really not the most fun we've had. Get the dehumidifier fixed and communicate with your staff a little better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-noblesville
