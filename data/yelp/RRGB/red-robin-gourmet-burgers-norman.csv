Matt M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",434,1109,252,5.0,8/14/2017,"We usually avoid chain restaurants much as we would the bubonic plague.  That's a fact. Now, my usual kvetching aside, I have to admit that we had a damn good meal here just a few months back. Seriously. I found my veggie burger to be well seasoned and cooked correctly, and my partner's hamburger was juicy and not overcooked. (Also pretty tasty, he noted.) Our (very friendly) waiter seated us near the bar, and always made sure that our glasses were filled and our empty plates taken away. We both loved the option of having ""bottomless"" fruit salad as an option to starchy fries. In spite of our misgivings about chain restaurants in general, we'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norman
Diana M.,"Joplin, MO",1,30,53,5.0,11/11/2017,Very good food. Cheeseburgers were cooked right. Flavor was great. Fries were hot and fresh. If we weren't already full we would have gotten more since they are bottomless. Service was great! She came back to ask if we wanted to go drinks. Very busy being before an OU Game only waited 20 m for a table.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norman
Emm S.,"Yukon, OK",80,175,808,2.0,10/13/2016,"I called in an order to pick up and was told it would be about 25 minutes. I got there 20 minutes later and everything had been sitting there getting cold. I came here exclusively for the pretzels and beer cheese so I ordered two extra cheeses. The extra cheese was not in the bag so I waited 7 more minutes for her to go it. I guess they had to milk the cow to make the cheese. The pretzels were really burnt. It's a good thing I love the cheese enough that I can eat it by itself. The teriyaki chicken sandwich was delicious, it just looked like someone had man-handled it before they wrapped it. It would be even better if it came with green chili strips on it. Half of the onion rings were cold in the middle, while the other half was almost hot so I guess I got a mix of really old ones and fresh ones together. The chili chili burger was perfect but the fries were dried out.  The freckled lemonade cake was incredible!  I could seriously eat several of those at once. It was about 7 on a Saturday night but they weren't really busy so I don't know why it took so long to get the food they missed, why it took so long to get the food in the first place or why a lot of it was old or cold.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norman
Gina L.,"Dallas, TX",36,94,397,5.0,5/31/2016,"What we ordered: I had a teriyaki chicken burger and my husband had a royal robin burger. We also had a pretzel. Honestly, I m not a fans of burger. I would say I would prevent to have burger in old days. However, red robin changed my mind. The teriyaki chicken burger taste a little sweet with a piece of pineapple inside. Juicy and fresh is are best word to describe. The chicken is tender and big. I am sure this is the best burger I ever had. Pretzel so far so good. Time: 2pm Person: 2 people,walk in without waiting Staff: Nice and polite- the girl is young and a little shy, but that's ok :) Price: around $40 something for two meals Will return or not: yes",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norman
Julianna Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",240,11,12,1.0,6/21/2017,"This afternoon my husband ordered the mushrooms and zucchini to start and when they came to table I we waited a bit to dig in but when we did dig in the mushroom literally burned my mouth and chin to the point of blisters... when I told the server about it she chuckled and said ""yeah sometimes those can be hot"" mind you I am sitting here with a blistered mouth, lips and chin over it... not thinking it is even slightly funny.  My husbands burger bun was soggy and mine was somehow covered in cinnamon sugar and I had a mushroom burger...  And that was just the beginning of things going wrong but oh well... we won't go back.

There were a lot of people working there and not many customers so I am not sure why the unattentiveness was so profound here. My table was sticky and my glass that my drink came in was broken on the side. The salt shaker was also broken. The food was good, not great, but above average.

Jan G.,"Norman, OK",0,19,,2.0,8/12/2017,"Went today for burgers. Ordered take-out online and the order was ready when we got there. We got three burgers - one with french fries and a tea, and two with onion rings and no drinks. Our bill was $45! The burgers weren't that good. The onion rings were greasy, but I attributed that to it being take-out and not eaten fresh from the kitchen. We've eaten there many times, but we were really disappointed with the quality of the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norman
Shannon S.,"Moore, OK",0,3,,1.0,7/23/2017,"We just had dinner here and my son ordered the chicken/shrimp combo meal.  He just had his wisdom teeth removed this past Thursday and this was his first real meal that he has had.  The shrimp was terrible and had a very bad taste.  We told our waitress about this and she said that she was sorry and asked if he would he like more fries.  The fries are bottomless so that should not have been offered as a compromise. (Also they  were very soggy) She also said that she would tell the manager but one never came over and she came back and said have a nice evening as if the issue was resolved.  We never ever complain about anything at restaurants unless it is extreme and that is very rare.  In this case it was terrible and we feel that it was not a big deal to them at all.  We will not return and we will let al of our friends and family be aware of this as well. $13 for 2 chicken strips,  soggy fries and shrimp that was either not cooked thoroughly or possibly rancid is ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norman
Moo C.,"Moore, OK",23,42,112,3.0,7/2/2016,"Solid 3. The burgers are pretty good and there are lots of choices to choose from. My husband and I shared the Whiskey River BBQ burger, which contains their signature bourbon-infused Whiskey River BBQ sauce, crispy onion straws, Cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes and mayo. They also have lots of different dipping sauces, which I guess is for the French fries. We tried all of the free sauces which included the buzzard, campfire, ranch, secret tavern sauce, and sweet spicy ketchup. We also ponied up $0.75 and tried the sweet pepper Thai sauce, one of their premium sauces. All of the sauces were pretty good except for the buzzard. I think it was supposed to be like a buffalo sauce, but it wasn't mixed correctly or something and the sauce and oil were completely separated and lacking flavor. Stirring it up ourselves didn't seem to help either.  Service was a little strange. Red Robin has new technology (well new to me) on all of their tables where you can press a button on a tablet to call a server, order your food, or play games for $1.99. We weren't sure how it worked exactly and before we could call a server, one appeared to take our drink order. After receiving our drinks, she disappeared for awhile so we figure that's where the calling a server button came in. So we pressed the button and she finally came to take our order. However, our drinks were never refilled, button or not. And we wanted to get a refill of their bottomless fries but she never looked in our direction. Another server saw the light on our tablet was on and asked us if we needed anything so he was able to give us a refill on our fries at least.  Finally, to pay, you use the tablet. You can pull up the check yourself, review, and slide your card on the tablet to pay. That actually was pretty handy since we didn't want to have to flag our server down again. Unfortunately, we had to because we had a reward to redeem which was not taken off appropriately.  Overall, they make decent burgers and their niche is in the toppings. I think I would come back again, but only if I had another deal or coupon to redeem.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norman

Eric F.,"Oklahoma City, OK",9,48,2,3.0,3/29/2015,"Having worked for RR I was a little surprised at some of the changes they have made.  Some changes are for the best, things the employees had been fighting for for years, others are clear attempts to falsify value or add costs. TL:DR version: some cost-cutting efforts cause minor gripes with their system, but the food is still darn good.  Their new wide array of false ""value"" illusion tableware make for an awful unstable mess of unmatched dishes to stack for clearing out the table (so pre-bussing is key, or you're probably going to hate your server).  More adult oriented now, which probably brings in more $$ but the family-orientation aspect suffers. Details: As far as the food goes its' pretty tasty still.  I can't complain of the quality vs price (a burger (w/side) and a drink will run you about $11-15 a person from what I gathered.  Their burger meat is wonderful, chicken used to be wonderful as well but did not have any to sample this visit. The weirdness I noticed is they have pushed towards becoming more of a sports bar rather than a family restaurant.  Alcohol is definitely being prominently displayed and pushed (many burger's have ""suggested"" beers listed with them), as well as advertisements galore. Their tacky polo's of yesteryear have been replaced with generic black polo's or button downs, which is less goofy-family and more streamlined-adult oriented.  No complaint there, everyone hated wearing the red/yellow/blue RR logo polo's. Where it gets weird is: they've added ""premium dipping sauces"" for 50-75cents.  Luckily they didn't make any of their classics (like campfire sauce) ""premiums"" but I found the notion of charging extra for dipping sauces absurd, considering their long standing tradition of a gazillion free dipping sauces for their fries. They also have tried to create the illusion that their food is a higher quality/value by changing up the classic baskets with smiling burgers and loaded with steak fries, to a variety of setups.  My wife got the tavern burger (2 kids burger patties stacked) in a basket, but my classic Banzai came on a plate with a large toothpick in the middle (no diaper to catch the drips) with a metal ring thing holding the fries up.  This makes it look fancy and snazzy, but honestly results in you getting what felt like about 1/2-2/3 the amount of fries I was used to.  A neat way to cut costs, but it just meant I had to ask for a frie-fill whereas I used to be content with just the one basket. They also seemed stingy with the dipping sauce.  I know a lot of sauces went to waste when I worked there, but bringing me a single ramekin about half filled with campfire sauce didn't last but half the fries, which is why we used to always bring out 1-2 ramekins filled nearly to the rim to keep our ""guests"" happy. The frie-fill came out on a silly metal wire thing.  The wire basket thing was designed for one major purpose: to lift the food up in your face which from what I gather is supposed to make your food appear larger (see: increased perceived ""value"").  Personally I hate tableware like this as it's awkward and clumpy, doesn't stack, clutters, and my ""perceived value"" vanishes waaaaaaay faster than it feels like it should.  (because that value was FAKE) Their glasses no longer have the RR logo, and appear larger.  What was completely bizarre to me was our server took my glass to refill it rather than bringing me a refill.  I'm sure this is more eco-friendly, but it completely blew my mind because it increases the risk of cross-contamination (ie: if the guest is sick, their germs are being carried behind the counter to the fountain) and interjects a moment when your guest is no longer in possession of a drink.  The old method was to bring a fresh new refill (not watered down by melting ice) out before the guest had emptied their prior glass.  Top them off to keep them happy! All in all it's nice to see some of the changes.  Not sure if it's a new trend, but the tables felt kinda sticky (the quatrinary sanitizer they used when I worked there was amazing at leaving the tables feeling fresh and clean, the tables felt like dirty sticky bar tables), and the bathroom was a mess.  Clearly some guys don't know how to aim, or the urinal was overflowing... couldn't tell which.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norman

Jessica D.,"Atlanta, GA",322,445,227,3.0,6/11/2013,"Red Robin.. yummm! Red Robin commercials air all the time in Georgia.. yet, to my knowledge, there isn't one within a reasonable driving distance from where I live. Can you tell (from my reviews) that we were on a quest to eat at every chain not available to us here? Lol Our waitress took our orders and went ahead and gave us a basket of fries to start. They offer unlimited fries, by the way, so don't be afraid to ask! The basket was small and we were hungry, so it disappeared quick. We also ordered the big tower of onion rings to start and it came out soon after the fries were gone. I'll just begin by saying that I abhor onions, much less onion rings, but I decided to give theirs a try. I always try things and usually end up regretting it later. But I actually liked theirs because it wasn't stringy when you bite into it and the breading was super thick and crunchy. The accompanying sauces made it taste a whole lot better, too. For our entrees, we all decided to split burgers, and to my surprise we all received our own basket of half a burger and fries. We all thought the burgers were alright/nothing ""gourmet"" about it. We ended up getting full with what we received, so we never bothered to ask for more of our unlimited fries. Overall, the service was.. alright. Our waitress was polite, but she didn't really come back to check on us even though it was slow. She also dropped pretty much everything she touched (minus the food, thank goodness), whether it was bringing us to-go boxes or taking away our silverware. Nothing spectacular, but I'd give it another go, given the chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norman?start=20

After about 25 minutes the server (who we hadn't seen since she took our order) brought us baskets of fries - dropped them on the table and left quickly. No words and no time for us to ask if the rest of our food was coming.  10 minutes later our burgers came. My husband's burger was not what he ordered. The manager who brought our food offered that one to him or to bring his correct burger. We opted for what he ordered.  The bacon on my burger was raw. Not limp like some people like but cold and raw. I finally got out servers attention and she ordered new bacon.  15 minutes later my husband had his burger.  The food was really tasty. Manager took cost of our drinks and my husband's burger off the bill without being asked.  The server could not make correct change and shorted us $5.
