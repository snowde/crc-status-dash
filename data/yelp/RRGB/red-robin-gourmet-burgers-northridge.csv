David K.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,200,7,1.0,3/21/2017,"Been here multiple times. Once a bug was in my friend's water. The manager came and apologized, and begrudgingly took my friend's meal off the bill. He looked like he wanted to punch me in the face, though, like I was trying to scam him for free food.  Another time, and now this might be my fault, I was on a diet, so I ordered some low calorie chicken dish, and wow, it was atrocious. Really awful. The waiter asked me how it was, and I told him, and he did nothing. I probably should have just had a burger, or something, but they shouldn't put things on the menu if they're going to be that bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=20
ReneRiz C.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",12,38,16,4.0,12/12/2017,"The price is reasonable. It was a pick a up order, the crew are pleasant. The location have a lot of parking, it's in the mall area.

Michael R.,"Sylmar, CA",13,60,1,3.0,1/6/2018,The burgers are all right.they look and sound good but no big deal.smash burgers are way better.the reason I gave it four stars was cause the service was great.waiter always came around.i won't be back unless it's free.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=20

Karie F.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",260,601,450,3.0,4/29/2017,"Wanted to give the Northridge location a try. Went with my son for lunch. We waited about 20 minutes for a seat. Maybe they were short staffed because there were plenty of open tables, so not sure why the wait was so long.  I ordered the Boca burger , Smokey Jack Tavern style, bottomless fries and a Pomegranate tea. It was tasty and the fries were good, seasoning was good also. Just had no distinctive flavors, as expected pre the menu description. Tea was good too. He had the Burnin Love and a Caramel Milkshake. The Milk shake was the best part for him. He wasn't thrilled with the burger.  Kind of disappointing for the price. Wasn't as flavorful as he was expecting, per the menu description. Service was good Ruby was our waitress, she was very friendly and attentive. Parking is plentiful also. Overall, I think they are a bit pricy for the quality of food. I won't make a special trip back and not sure if I would even come back if in the area, just not that impressed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=20

Melanie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,161,4,2.0,9/10/2017,"I've been to lots of Red Robins. The service at this one was pretty abysmal, which is disappointing considering I choose to come here with my husband for my birthday dinner. We only saw our waiter three times- when he took our order, when he refilled our drinks, and when he cleared the table. Someone else brought our food, and we never saw anyone other than that. I came here bc the limeade is my favorite drink, but we could never catch anyone to get refills.  Also, the layout of the restaurant is much different from their other locations, and I did not like it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=20
Jerry K.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,2,,1.0,11/26/2017,"First the food was good but overpriced. The one star is because of the worst service I had in years. We checked in and was told it will be twenty minutes even though they had tables on the patio. We were seated in about fifteen minutes. They took our drink orders and returned very soon. We had to wait almost twenty minutes for someone to take our orders. Nobody checked on us.  By the time our food came my drink was empty, so I ask for a refill it took more than ten minutes  to get it, i had to ask for again. I had to eat most of my food with out a drink. We had no ketchup on the table and didn't get any until half way through our meal. The only reason I left a tip was because I had a free burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=20

Patrick B.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,75,90,2.0,12/2/2017,"I have never consistently received so much neglectful service time and time again from one location. The frequency which the servers stop at the tables is incredibly minimal. Sip your drinks and chew your bottomless fries slowly, because you won't be getting more for another 20 minutes. Everything else is good though, and all the staff have the right attitude, but timely customer service is essential in the food service industry, and this is one major downfall for this Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=20
Debby B.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",104,42,2,5.0,9/23/2017,Went to Red Robin tonight for my grandson's 16th birthday dinner.  There were 2 families with a total of 14 which included 2 high chair babies.  Mgr Ryan was on duty tonight which made things even better.   Each family had their own ticket.  Every thing was find with our ticket but had issues with the second ticket. Mgr Ryan was superb in handling the issue and went over and beyond awesome to make things right.  That is why the 5 stars.  All because of Mgr. Ryan.  If all managers could be like Ryan what a wonderful experience we would always have no matter where we go.  Thank you Mgr. Ryan for all you did tonight and looking forward to our next visit at Red Robin. Debby,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=20
Sarah S.,"Canoga Park, CA",173,12,,5.0,9/14/2017,"I love this red robin. There was a point in time where I was here weekly, every friday night. Also, I have come here two years in a row for my birthday and they have always been super accommodating! The bartenders are great and So is the bartending (supervisor?) I can't remember his name but he is very tall and friendly. Also our waiter Cole? Colin? (has blonde hair) was fantastic. He was quite attentive, funny, accommodating, exact, and professional. Other waiters we have had here are great too. I can't remember their names but the tall guy with cool tattoos, and the one with the Edgar Allan poe tattoo are two other favorites!  As for the location: The food is great, consistent and always fresh. I have never had bad service here, even when it is busy and I've been here atleast 20 times (probably more). Lastly, It's neatly kept. The same cannot be said for other locations I have been.

Stephan L.,"Palmdale, CA",19,2,,1.0,11/21/2017,"Horrible, slow service with mediocre food.  We waited over 30 minutes from the time of ordering to getting our (barely warm) food.  Clearly, it had been sitting there a while waiting for us.  Our server was having a very difficult time with efficiency.  We had to ask for drink refills, as for utensils, ask for napkins multiple times, ask for mustard, ask for the milk we ordered and which didn't come out for another 10 minutes after the rest of the drinks.  What server doesn't put napkins or utensils on the table until 5-10 minutes after the food is delivered?  What server or restaurant makes its patrons ask for napkins in the first place?  There was obviously something wrong in the kitchen because after our food came out, everyone else's food sitting near us came out 5 minutes later, even the people who just sat down 15 minutes previously.  The management should have come and explained the issue to us.  Sorry Red Robin, but you've lost a customer for life.  You couldn't pay me to eat there again, especially this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=20
Carol K.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",131,73,337,1.0,11/14/2016,"One of the managers, kathy, was very helpful and fixed our order after it came out super late (They took more than 45 min)! after we ordered our food! It must have sat under a food lamp because it was dried out and cold!  The burgers were NASTY!   My son ordered a sunny side up egg to add on to his burger and it was ice cold!  If it weren't for Kathy, this would've been the WORST EXPERIENCE at a restaurant ever!!!  Our waiter was beyond terrible!!! We ordered nachos and 3 burgers but everything that came out (over 45 minutes later, was cold, dry and disgusting!) After we were seated we told him we were so hungry that we didnt care what order the food came out in. He said he would bring some fries out first so we could.start on that. We said ""thank you so much!"" Then when he brought it out, I even did a little dance saying ""YAY! Thank u soooooo much!"" Well I guess he thought that meant he didn't have to tend to us anymore, and that we were happy.  Because after that we literally did not see him for another 45 minutes or more!!!! It was around 9 pm by then and we entered the restaurant before 8pm!  Another server came by and helped us because she saw that we were waiting so long and not being taken care of!  We were grateful to her so we tipped her instead!  We also let Kathy know everything that happened and she did handle the whole situation professionally apologizing to us and letting us know that it was unacceptable and that she would have a talk with him.  I was in shock with all of the comments he made! I can't believe I didn't go off on him of how rude he was and how wrong he was for treating us in a threatening manner! He even said ""when I brought your fries out first, I went from being the best server in the world to the worst server in the world in 2 seconds."" What?!!  We were confused at that comment until we realized that he said that because of my positive ways in the beginning saying ""yay, thank you so much"" and 'dancing'.... This just proved that he felt that we didn't need anymore attention and that he could focus on his other customers! He felt that in his eyes we were good. Off of just 1 basket of fries???  He didn't even give us silverware ir napkins when the  fries came out, and said they weren't clean! So we didnt get our silverware until we asked the other server. My son needed water and asked, he said ok, then we didn't see him for over 45 minutes!  Then when he passed by and said some other comments that just were unacceptable that is when we finally decided to call the manager Kathy. Thank you again, Kathy for taking care of us! The 2nd burger YOU brought out was good, and like we told you, we hope that people at corporate realize what a gem they have in YOU! You handled this whole HORRIFIC situation (where my son didn't even eat until way past 9 and mind you, separate from when we ate) better with your kind and professional manner. We thank you again! Kathy gets 10/10 However I will NEVER go to this red robin! Because I was dealing with Kathy our waiter was mad dogging us the whole time and Kathy decided she better walk us out.

Marissa B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,5,,5.0,11/14/2017,Service is awesome food is amazing. Never disappointed with the food or service . The manager Ryan is hands down the best manager we have ever come across. He makes everyone feel like family and walks around to all tables to make sure their dining experience is up to par. I would defenitly recommend this place to everyone. Milkshakes are delicious desserts are out of this world. Best burger selection. Chicken and Salmon sandwiches are to die for.

Ferlay S.,"Woodland Hills, CA",215,184,323,3.0,7/5/2017,"Eh. The ""new"" Red Robin is fine, a little more modern and simple, no more of the ""messiness"" decor like it was in the 90s. I kinda miss it. Anyway, I feel like I'm being very generous with the rating, but there's no way to give 1/2 votes. I would give RR 2 1/2 stars. The place is always busy, the service sucks, which is weird bc when it was the old, smaller RR, service was much better. This new facelift seems to have happened at the expense of quality customer service. Don't get me wrong, the servers are nice, but it's just s l o w. I hate having to repeat my request for refills and napkins and ranch. I also hate to sound demanding, asking for all those at once. But you have to, bc you aren't sure if the servers will make their way back to you in a timely manner. I suppose the 1/2 star to make it 3 goes to the niceness of the staff. They just need to work on their timeliness.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=20

I upgraded to the chili cheese fries which are not unlimited but that's what I wanted..could be more generous on the chili fries don't really give u a huge portion..paired my burger with stone IPA which is one of my go to IPA's..great job red robin keep up the good work..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=80

Conor B.,"Chatsworth, CA",163,1350,106,3.0,1/7/2016,"This is one of the nicest Red Robins I've ever been too. I was really surprised when I walked in. I guess they're going for a classier look than the memorabilia covered walls of other locations. And you know what, I think it's a great decision! Food was good as usual. My burger bun was a little soft so it soaked up juices & got a bit mushy by the end of the meal, but oh well. My wife had also ordered a 2nd round of her fries, but we waited too long and she got full. By the time we paid, the waitress just never came back. And that was another weird thing. We had about 3-4 different people serve or take our orders from the minute we came in. 1 to take an appetizer order, 1 to bring it, 1 to take our drink and main meal order, & another to bring it to us. Maybe it's an efficiency move for the restaurant, but it just felt weird never knowing who was going to show up.  In all, I'll definitely come back to this location. I'll just prepare myself for the little kinks we experienced this time around. Hopefully they'll be gone the 2nd time around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=80
Dinah S.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,141,416,4.0,1/2/2016,"First if all, I like that this got moved to a bigger and more accessible location,  near other restautants.  It is Saturday afternoon,  there's a 20 minute wait. Party of 1 with toddler was seated by Joshua, very friendly and able to get highchair as requested. Our order: guac salsa chips, cheese sandwich bites, cup of tortilla soup, red Robin gourmet burger, kids milk. Note: portions look smaller but overall had a good meal. Food wise I would give 3.5 but I do notice the team here works together from servers to managers, so that says something.

Aram T.,"Porter Ranch, CA",416,158,503,3.0,11/20/2015,Eh... not really crazy about this place. Service was good but the food wasn't really anything to write home about. So many different types of burgers and I'm sure one of them will satisfy your taste buds for the evening.

First of all your waiters/waitress need to be more knowledgeable on your product . If I would have know that my salad was just going to be literally 3 lettuce spears I would have ordered something else . $9.89 should not be a price to pay for something like that . On top of that my lettuce was not only hot but it looked old . When I received it after 25 min of waiting we go silverware once we got one we shared .  After the above duty of cutting up my salad I come to find I have no fork so I got tired of waiting for the waitress to stop by .  When it comes to leaving and we split the check the waitress did it all wrong and I was so done with my visit that I just payed for it and left it's bs .

Judy H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,50,99,2.0,12/5/2015,"The problem with Red Robin is that they say they have gourmet burgers, but they don't. They have some specialty toppings and a bit of a creative menu, but they're not gourmet. The burgers are average. Run of the mill. They've got to step it up on the burger patty to even approach gourmet.  We ordered a Keep it Simple Burger with grilled onions, a Black and Bleu Burger, and kids chicken tenders. We also ordered the garlic aioli for dipping the fries. If you've got to eat, the burgers are fine, but no better than average. The garlic aioli was no good.  The service was friendly. Both the hostess and waitress were genuine. We did not wait too long for our food.  I don't like the decor much. I like the kitsch in the old restaurant, the miniature Statue of Liberty, a ton of fun posters on the walls, merry-go-round horse, etc. These items often even became part of our dinner conversation. Now it's boring, nothing much to look at. The lights are wrapped in paper. The tables are too close together. We could use some good restaurants here in Northridge. I can't say this is going to be one of them. I'd sooner pick Yard House or Claim Jumpers just a few steps away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=80

The portions of the bottomless fries etc looked small on the plate but honestly it was too much food for us to get through. I was given 6 onion rings and thought it was hilarious, but I only ended up getting down 5.5 of them. That said, the service we got was excellent.

We arrived with a party of 14 at 3:30pm. After one hour we were finally seated. 2 hours later I had to complain to Ryan the manager that we were still waiting to have our order taken and to see if they could turn up the heat since it was now cold outside  Now at 2.5 hours from arriving Ryan offered us hot chocolate for the wait.

Too A.,"Valencia, Valencia, CA",10,28,43,3.0,10/24/2017,"Red Robin, always sounds good, especially with unlimited fries. I prefer clucks and fries. If you don't mind the wait, you could be waiting a long time before your server comes around again even though they have an electronic gadget at the table to call server or order food. So, if you have time to spare, this place could be an option. Doesn't seem like the wait times differ from one area to the next. Anyways, food is always to be expected, I mean you can't go wrong with clucks and fries or the burgers.  Military friendly: yes, 10%",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge

I ordered a guacamole bacon burger. The burger was cooked well, but overall was lacking flavor in the meat and the ingredients were lacking quality. There was barely any guacamole on it so it tasted somewhat dry. The guacamole burger I had at jack in the box was honestly better.  All their burgers come with bottomless fries which is cool, except the taste is a huge miss for me. They taste like pre-frozen, packaged fries and get cold really fast. I had to dip them in tons of aioli sauce for them to be edible. The service however is pretty good here, I would say way better than the food itself. Our waiter was friendly and he came by to check on us several times. Overall I don't think I'd come here again.

We ordered the boneless BBQ chicken wings for an appetizer, his regular burger & fries, and I had a bowl of the chicken tortilla soup. We were surprised that our entrees came out well before our wings did. The moment we looked at the wings, we could tell that they were barely dipped in BBQ sauce.

Must try the spicy ketchup with garlic fries and fry seasoning!   we got a large strawberry lemonade tavern double burger and bottomless garlic fries for $15! Can't go wrong with that!

Jen S.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,71,42,5.0,4/17/2017,"I don't typically review chain restaurants because one rarely ever differs from the rest, but I felt inclined to review this Red Robin location because I was dismayed to find reviews on here that don't reflect the caliber and quality of the staff at this location.  I work in Northridge and favor this restaurant over the others in the area. For one, I really like that they section areas off by population. The bar and surrounding areas are only for adults 21+, whereas the seating area to the left of the hostess stand and patio nearest the parking lot are for families. That's awesome, in my opinion because no one really wants to be around children unless you really have to be. Amirite?? I digress. Secondly, the staff here is super friendly and consistent. If you feel like chatting it up, the bartenders are happy to oblige, but if you're there to simply wash away the day's nasty aftertaste they are fine with simply refilling your glass and fry basket. Speaking of the staff-Jacklynn, Conny and Alex are some of the best people to be served by. They give you legit recommendations for food and any new beers on tap.  Lastly, although I rarely come here with more than one person, they are happy to accommodate larger parties with a little notice. Even though they don't take reservations, we called ahead for a party of 20 once and by the time we got to the restaurant they were ready for us and we had no wait.  Overall, don't be deterred by the sour Sallies who complain about trying to use expired 15% off coupons on here.

Aj A.,"Chatsworth, CA",12,210,2030,3.0,4/15/2016,"Finally I got to try out this RR and to be honest, I was not too thrilled about the food. But let me say this, the hostess, ""Jodi"" was amazingly friendly and cheerful. She recommended the Ramen burger which we ended up ordering.  The atmosphere and the ambiance was not bad. If you like to watch TV, they have quite few of them all around the place. Nice small bar where you can have you food and booze while watching some of the sports they are showing.  SERVICE**** I have to say that the service was kind of slow at the beginning. They had this tablet at the table and we were wondering if we were suppose to use it to place our order or not. We decided to try it out, we choose one item but we were unable to order. So the tablet is used as a menu I guess or maybe its activated in different time than the lunch time.  We flagged the waitress ""Jackie or Jacqueline"" am not sure of the name, she was rushing and told us give me a minute please. Few minutes later she came back and apologized, then she took our order. I will say she was attentive to our needs although she was kind of rushing and that is not her fault am sure, I think they were understaffed and that is a management problem that slows down service and full attention to customers. I also notice the bartender who seems to be taking orders from the bar and somewhere else. This guy was a hustler, he was running back and forth none stop trying to take care or bills and other things. Thumbs up to him.  THE FOOD*** We ordered as follow: ===Appetizer===Creamy Artichoke & Spinach Dip and for the price of $7 it was just OK, nothing that wowed us. ===Red Robin's Finest Burger=== Ciabatta bun with double beef, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and egg for around the $15 dollars with all the fries you can eat.  We ordered this to be cooked medium rare and it came cooked almost medium well. It really lacked the taste and flavor, dry, and the fried egg came already with the egg yolk busted and all over the plate. At the end, I told the waitress it was not cooked as requested, she replied "" but you ate it all"" oh yeah we ate it all cause we were hungry and not welling to wait any longer for it to be ordered again. This was not a winner hamburger at all. You can agree or disagree but that is my personal opinion.  ===Ramen Burger===This is what the hostess Jodi recommended. Crispy Ramen noodles shaped as a bun, thick piece of beef patty with lettuce, tomatoes and cheese, ordered medium. I have to say this was really delicious. We loved the crunchiness of the Ramen noodles. The beef was cooked as ordered but still lacked the flavor.  I would say that I would not be running to have a hamburger at RR anytime soon.

I had my usual, the Bleu Robin with sweet potato fries (unlimited!!!! Omg) and both were delicious!!! The service was spectacular!! We requested a booth and it was perfect.  The host noticed that we were eyeing the TVs a bit later and came back (because the bbal finals were on) and she asked if we wanted to be closer. We said we were fine but appreciated that she even offered.  Our server, Conny, and the other guy (sorry, I don't know his name) were awesome! They were attentive and helpful the entire time.

She always finds good drinks to recommend me when I can't decide and she always maintains a nice friendly conversation. Aside from her service this location is really good. I've tried basically everything their menu and I can't seem to decide what I like more. The service is quick and place is practically spotless considering how busy they get.

So we waited and waited while 4 parties of 3,4, even 5 people were seated after us. So I asked the host what the wait was? Her reply was, we are waiting for tables to be cleaned... really?? When did that become the responsibility of the consumer? maybe they should have employees attending to tables cleanliness? I asked for the manager, ""Tony"". He was apologetic and had them clean the tables but not until I asked them to. By the time we were able to be seated it was 1:47pm. Way too long for lunch!!

The waiter I believe CJ is his name was more into the game then he was with me and my friends. I immediately called a manager, and explained that he got two of our orders wrong and seemed to be more into the game than into working. They made my burger completely wrong, sent it back and as a joke put 7 fries and only 7 in my basket. It's unlimited fries which is great, but the chef thought they would teach me a lesson by fixing the burger and giving me 7 fries, is that a joke?

Our server Marina was awesome and on top of her game (kudos to Marina). As for the food, meh. The onion soup was way too salty.

Michael S.,"Sylmar, CA",26,95,31,3.0,3/15/2016,"Visually, this is not one of your typical Red Robin locations.  The decor is a bit different and I kind of miss the traditional look.   It looks like someone was trying to save some money, but I'm not an interior decorator and it didn't impact my experience on iota . . . so c'est la vie! They were very busy when we arrived, but we got seated in the time frame they estimated for us and we were happy. The food was great, however they were slow to replenish drinks and refills on fries were very hard to come by.  Part of the reason might be that they use a tag team approach for serving customers.  We had three or four different servers take our requests and/or bring our items.  I suppose they view it as being efficient, and maybe it is when it is executed correctly, but it came across like tag team night at a WWF event.

Had a great experience on valentine's day food made just right, drinks refreshing, mood romantic on the outside patio. Unfortunately sitting inside was a little unbearable - the ac was busted and the place felt like a sauna (granted I know this isn't their usually room temp), but to top it off we had to wait and extra 15 minutes just to be set outside even though we were told we'd have a shorter wait time.

David P.,"San Fernando Valley, CA",20,138,115,5.0,5/30/2016,As several yelpers have mentioned this location looks different from other Red Robin branches. This is because for a brief time this was Elephant Bar. They filed Bankruptcy and apparently left  all the tables and fixtures behind when they closed this location. Red Robin changed little or nothing when they moved in. Personally I like this easy to access location at the mall's north end. The hostess directed me to the bar area for immediate seating as the dining room had several people waiting to be seated. I found a high-top table and took a seat. I looked at the menu and decided on the Smoke and Pepper burger with garlic herb fries.  The garlic herb fries were tasty but had more melted parmesan than garlic or herbs. The burger was excellent. The pepper was subtle enough so it didn't overpower the other flavors of the burger. The large patty was seasoned and cooked perfectly.

Jason B.,"Tarzana, CA",13,119,40,1.0,9/17/2015,They just moved from under the parking lot to next to wood ranch  HORRIBLE FAILURE Warm beer pathetic for a brand new beer tap and my burger didn't even show up I left after waiting 40 min The two locations in the unit prior the elephant bar and the Mexican cantina were huge how they managed to make the red robin so small is beyond me. Half the size as it was when it was in the prior location. You would think it would be better it's incredibly worse  horrible service had to walk out  without eating I've been waiting so long  Failure failure failure  the only plus was the new bar has sound on the tvs unlike any other red robin so the game is on and I can hear it since the bar is separated from the rest of the small resturaunt.

Cris P.,"Reseda, Los Angeles, CA",5,21,6,2.0,2/7/2016,"I've always loved Red Robin. I've had plenty of positive experiences.. But unfortunately, yesterday just wasn't a nice experience. The old Northridge location across from See's Candy was so much more home-y and nicer with nice dim lighting. This new one by WoodRanch just has a Denny's Vibe.  The walls are bland with just random decorations trying to hide the bland mess.  As for service, the hostesses had a really superficial smile. You can tell when a smile is real and fake. The waitress was really nice and sweet though so that's what got at least two stars. She had to leave unfortunately due to her shift ending halfway in so we tipped her. The waiter that took care of us afterward though... We even requested the server through the app that they have on the tablets, and he didn't come to us seven minutes later despite him walking past us twice and clearly noticing that the tablet was flashing red..

She never offered me a child's menu for my son, & she never came by to check up on us. I had to ask another server for missing items such as fries & condiments. As a former employee for a famously known restaurant I know the how's & the where abouts on how a restaurant works, so I didn't bother making a scene with her, I spoke to the manager at the time & she apologized, but didn't offer to comp any of our orders for being incorrect. It also bothered me that they don't offer MILITARY discounts. My brother a USMC who came to visit us from Camp Pendleton for that weekend joined us & it was a shame that they couldn't offer us some type of discount.

A waitress tried to squeeze through with high chairs but the space is so tight she had to lift them over a guest's head and make him duck. Um, go around?

Waitress acknowledged but another waitress brought it without soup and said she didn't know. Only a few people eating at 10:15 when we were seated but order took 45 minutes for a soup as entree and simple burger.  Burger finally arrived but missing side salad.  When waitress advised she ran and got the salad but never asked what dressing. Hmm salad and dressing. Hard concept.  Burger came with lettuce tomato and onion on side. Lettuce was totally wilted which you could tell by looking or touching.  Told waitress when she came after asking for her since she never came to check in on us for refills.  We left without tipping vowing never to return. As we left young guy tells us "" hey guys have a good night"". We are not guys.  Nor dressed to confuse him of such but senior women who know what is a proper greeting.  Horrible experience to end our Saturday night.  Thanks but no thanks Red Robin.  Both my daughter and my friends daughter are into social media so I am sure this will cover a few hundred people in postings shared.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=120

I enjoyed the atmosphere, the colors, the designs on the walls, etc. The food itself was very good, the gourmet burgers especially.  However, one thing that this Red Robin lacked very much was good service. Our server was simply not there when we needed him. We barely saw him, he did not check on us, and we always needed to flag him down to get something. Not only that, but the orders were mixed up as well. We ordered garlic fries twice and got original both times, and we had to ask for bbq sauce and ranch several times before actually getting it. We also ordered our gourmet burger done medium rare, but they all came in well done. But the manager did indeed come to the rescue and was extremely kind. He apologized for the orders and got them fixed as soon as he could. He came back with them, asked how it was, and then a couple minutes later he came in to check if we needed anything else and if everything turned out alright.

I ordered a crispy chicken sandwich (yeah, I know, fried chicken, throwing health out the window), on a wheat bun and opted for the side salad with balsamic vinaigrette. The good thing?

The wait was only about 10 min after they told us it would be 15-20 min.  They gave us a half booth and a half table which I didn't mind. What I do mind is how small the table is. There are a little too many things on it that we didn't even use and put everything to the side so that we could see each other.  Anyway after that only con, everything else was positive. The servers were very attentive and kind and happy. We ordered appetizers: Red's Bold Boneless Wings with Buffalo sauce (not spicy for me which I like!) and the Creamy Artichoke and Spinach Dip. Both appetizers were delicious, only thing I can mention to make it better - give us more dip =) it was too yummy.  I ordered the chocolate oreo milkshake and my friend ordered a cider beer (which i forget the name of). My milkshake was very yummy and my friend enjoyed her beverage as well. Now our entrees. I ordered the Clucks and fries and my friend ordered the Guacamole Bacon burger. We both enjoyed our meals very much (I'm a big fan of strips and if those are good the place is good).  This has been the second time I have been to Red Robin, first at the old location inside the mall and the first time at this new location still located at the mall but outside next to Woodranch.  The place was neat and clean, the staff is friendly, the wait was short, the place is louder than it used to be but it's not so loud that it's annoying, my friend and I could still hold up a conversation.

Today I watched while the host and hostess continued to sit parties of threes and fours that arrived after our party of six. I used to waitress in college so I know how hard the job can be and I  learned you can push tables together to accomodate a party of six or more. I attempted to ask the hosts but they said you have a large party! We have to sit the smaller parties first. We walked out along with other so called large parties and all went over to wood ranch grill. We received excellent friendly service and delicious food at wood ranch.

When we were shown our table it has a disgusting amount of food under it and crawling out as well. It seriously looked like they ran out of room on the table and instead decided to dine on the floor. Instead of cleaning it up right away the hostess prompted us to sit down into the puddled up booth of whatever they decided to ""clean"" the seats with. DISGUSTING.  We decided to continue on anyway as our waitress Brianna was super nice. On my way to the restroom I saw about six open tables in which four of them had dirty dishes on.

Nan G.,"San Fernando, CA",17,43,67,3.0,10/21/2015,"I was excited to have lunch here yesterday to see the RR resto they moved from inside to a bigger place outside the mall.  Re-opened on Oct 14.    The new place is a lot bigger compared to the one in the mall. Interior is avant garde and perfect marriage of colors and designs. A lot less confining. On this visit I ordered the Uberburger, really tasty  and juicy. I have to say RR does make really good burgers. Now, I usually order my burger with the bottomless root beer float and have them bring me a plate of crispy beefsteak  fries for starters. You may wonder why only 3 stars?  Here goes, Rosie introduced herself as our waitress. So we went ahead and ordered. After 15 minutes another girl comes along and gave me a plate of stale fries, which I had to return. Then after another 10 mins, a guy brings me a glass with ice cream, it took him another 5 min to bring a glass of flat root beer. Now the ice cream is melted and root beer at room temp. That does not make it a refreshing float. I didn't return it anymore because of my rapid hypoglycemia.  It took then another 20 mins, finally Rosie appears to bring my burger.  Lastly, I had to ask for utensils and napkins. Wasn't that supposed to come first? At least with the burger I have no complaints. Once we're done eating a plate of over crispy fries arrives. You kidding me? In the occasion of my birthday I got an ice cream sundae, which didn't bring splashes of sunshine on this day.   I had to ask Rosie if everybody was new at this branch, because I do not see any familiar servers. Rosie said some are but most are old. Beffuddling because, it really felt like they were still on a dry run.  I still have to thank them though for my free birthday burger. Hence in average 3 stars, good burger yes, but less than satisfactory service.

Leo C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1055,641,3504,3.0,9/24/2012,"I love coming to Red Robin for its sports bar atmosphere and good food. It's also a lot closer to my house then Topanga location. They have lots of flat screen TV's for catching the game and cool picture decors of sports and movie poster all over their wall. The location inside the Northridge Mall is better and convenient alternative to eating at food court.  I usually come here when I go shopping at the mall and don't want to drive around town to look for a place to eat.   When I come here with a family and friends during lunch or dinner time, wait time averages about 10-20 minutes. Service is usually good depending how busy they are. I've had a few bad moments where the food took a long time or they made a mistake with my order, but followed by excellent service the next visit.  The burgers here are insanely delicious and they got a great selection to choose from on their menu. My favorite burgers are the whiskey BBQ and Royal Red Robin. The Whiskey BBQ Burger is infused with their signature bourbon BBQ sauce topped with cheddar cheese, crispy onion straws, lettuce, fresh tomatoes & mayo. The flavors just explode in your mouth and so delicious. While the Royal Red Robin is topped with fried egg, hardwood-smoked bacon, American cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and mayo. The smokiness of the bacon and fried egg make this burger decadent and so good. Add bottomless fries and freckled lemonade which include free refills, I'm in food coma.  Overall - Red Robin is a fun place to kick back and enjoy good food. They also have great selections of salads and entrees for those who aren't in a burger mood. Note: They also have Glutten free bun's for those who are looking to reduce their carb intake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=140

I asked for some blue cheese spread to help moisten the burger and he brought it after I put ketchup on it and ate it. The rest of our group had finished their meals before the waiter finally brought it.  There's nothing worse than ketchup on blue cheese but I did it to see if it would help make it a little moist.  The manager came by to see if we enjoyed our meals.

The burger, on the other hand, was very tasteless. I ordered medium-rare. The bleu cheese was not noticeable on the burger and there were only two small mushrooms, the rest being ""caramelized"" onions that didnt spend much time being on the pan, to be sure. The patty itself was alright but was just a slab of meat, no seasoning at all. Not sure what cheese was put on the patty but it was nondescript. Overall a terrible burger and meal in general.

Ordered blue ribbon burger w/garlic fries, a1 peppercorn burger, bacon cheese burger no tomato (they included the tomato anyways ... not a big deal) and kids mini corn dog w/apples. One of the burgers was over cooked (medium rare was cooked medium well) other than that all the food was great. Tried the Chipotle and bacon dipping sauces and they were also very good.

Matt A.,"Pasadena, CA",49,218,161,2.0,5/7/2013,"I have mixed feelings with Red Robin.  I think they have some decent party hour food and burgers that aren't too bad.  I've had a fair number of the burgers, including the chicken sandwiches and appetizers and you're not getting a top shelf burger but its sort of family meets beer. The main reason I gave the 2 stars instead of a 3 or 4 is that it seems to never fail I get terrible service.  The waiters and waitresses are nice enough but it seems they are spread too thin or there is a lack or organization between the management and their staff.  Training may also been needed on both sides to tighten the ship up. Typically it starts out well, I've always been seated quickly which is great, the menus are fast, the staff usually get the orders together and into the kitchen and the food generally comes out consistent and fairly quickly.  Where things tend to go south are refills on drinks or getting your waiter outside the times they specifically come by to see if you need anything else.  On a couple occasions I've had a obviously dirty cup (with some lettuce inside) and I understand they probably throw it through a machine washer but when it comes out the person stacking them for use missed it, whatever process it goes through to make it to the waiters stack missed it, the waiter missed it and then...it makes it to my table and if you don't catch it right away good luck trying to get your waiter for a replacement.  So this adds to my training comment or, it might be representative of a worse issue where the staff don't care to check the details, I'm hoping its the first one. I want this place to be better, until then, 2 stars it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=180

We ordered the single order of cheese sticks and it came out to be about 5 pieces. It was great :) Tasted awesome too!

Perfectly cooked and crispy, greasy in that good way, with a light sprinkling of sea salt that really just worked. My dad even ate them and he claims he hates sweet potato fries. He ate too many.  But anyway, I was expecting this dried out, under seasoned, bland burger but I got a delicious, perfectly cooked burger that had the perfect blend of spice.

It is a great place to bring children without having to worry about how loud it gets. They offer a full bar and an OK selection of beer. It is a shame in Los Angeles that any restaurant does not tap into local craft brewers and I rate it as a miss for Red Robin. They could do much better in this area, which is why it is a 4 star rating. The burgers are above average and with multiple offerings to please any palate. I like the fact they roll promotions frequently that allows new tastes to come in and out. The kids menu has many choices as well to please the pickiness kids can have, but what about my craft beer for the beer snob pickiness. Ok, ok it's not about the beer :) wait yes it is, Red Robin get better craft beers! I am always satisfied with the food and if not feeling a burger I go for the wedge and a bowl of chili.

Gino L.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",0,5,4,1.0,10/4/2016,"The only reason I would not give this place lower than one star is because there is no lower rating. My wife, kids and I were seated fairly quickly and sat for 20 minutes on a marginally busy Tuesday night (October 4th, just so the manager and staff can see this) with not a single waiter, waitress or manager even giving our table a glance. Seriously, I counted six wait staff, all walked by without noticing at the fact we had a pile of close menus on our table, a computer with a blinking low battery light and all of us trying to make eye contact with ANYONE. The hostess saw me, three times, but still no one stopped by. The busboy cleaned the table right next to us, and never even looked at us. Maybe if the manager, who was flitting around not more than two tables away, had bothered to look around at how his patrons were doing, maybe we would have been noticed. We ended up at Wood Ranch, which is more expensive, but A MUCH BETTER CHOICE OVERALL. Four stars, Wood Ranch at the Northridge Fashion Center.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=200
J O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,2.0,1/28/2016,"Went last night and it wasn't that crowded so I'm curious why the service was so bad.  We waited quite awhile for our food.  Once they brought our food, my sons immediately ask for more ""bottomless fries"". The server finally came back with one order of fries for my two sons!  So they again asked for more fries which came when they were already finished with their burgers. We also had to flag someone down to get our obviously empty cups refilled. Their food may be good but they need to work on their service!

Keren K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,3,2.0,4/19/2016,"I'm Re reviewing because I'm so upset from my visit today. My girls realllly wanted to go for their bday dinner. They have a great children's menu so I was hesitant because I know if we come here it's slow rolling.. We arrived and it was freezing from the AC Hostess gave the kids kid menus and when we asked for crayons she said they were out since last nighy . (OK wow that's 24 hours. For a family place that's a long time to be out...) she did bring us markers which was nice of her The server himself was.sweet but the food service   slow. One of my kids menu arrived after the adult entree and we waited more than 15 minutes for it.  Everytime we asked for a refill on food it took so ooo long. Again im sticking to my last review about managemetn... without a doubt the manager Joe (female) is such a bad attempt for a manager. We complained about the pasta not coming for the child.. her response was, ""well it's not ready in the kitchen and the marinara is not ready"".. (after more than 15 minutes) a kids meal? Really how about a manager say ""so sorry let mw go and see if I can get it out."" She never came back to check on anything or if we got the pasta... The worst part which I seriously thought was a joke was I ordered a desert when we were done with the food. (Which half the plates were not bussed and we were left with kids at the table with empty plates all over).. it took more than 16 minutes.. checked on my phone for it. My kids and husband left and went for a walk in the mall and my friend with her child left to go home because she couldn't wait any longer and it was getting late...so I keep waiting and waiting and I ask the server to check..  I sit and wait more with my other child who stayed with me and just us two r left...  Then a few minutes later he comes back and says ""u still don't have it?"" I said no .. (and nd I promised my daughter who stayed with me so I waited more) I said ""no but can u check?"" A few minutes later he comes back with the check and I look at him and I look at the check and again at him and ask ""what about the brownie?"" ""Oh u want it?"" He asks.. ummm yes I've been waiting like 20 minutes and everyone has left what do u think I'm waiting for.. ""oh because I thought u said u don't want it... "" then he says ""they made it I just didn't bring it"".. I said to him to please bring it we have Been waiting a long time. He says ok and then mentions that he took it off the check because he thought I didn't want it.. but because he already took it off he won't add it back on... (oh you think...gee should I thank him?) My whole family left already and me and my daughter were the only one to enjoy it. No one had the energy to wait for this damm brownie. It was good but omg.. this is it... Kids want or not.. never coming back here. Same problems every single timw. And when u sit with kids the last thing u want is to wast time on waiting more than u should. . Seems like this place doe st have correct leadership or managemnt. Servers can't handle the load of tables or customer requests and we all end up leaving disappointed and upset.

Lauren A.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",122,85,18,4.0,5/1/2014,"So for the past few months I have had a major hard-on for Red Robin. Let me tell you why: The food is soooooo gooooooooooooood. I would've given it 5 stars but the servers are super awkward and sometimes don't listen with the exception of Brandon who was the best waiter I've had here so far!! Give that man a raise! The other servers I have were totally frazzled and scatter brained. He seems like the only one that knows how to keep his shit together.   Let me recommend the whiskey river burger and getting your fries out first! Best decision I ever made was to get my fries out first. Also, the peach tea is perfection. My sister, my friend, and I are all obsessed with it. It's perfect. I am also recommending the cookie magic shake. Holy hell!! My sister got the smaller version of this and when we tried it, we quickly called over our server to upgrade to the monster version cuz we had to have more ASAP! It's that good.  Last but not least I just want to tell Red Robin that I'm not paying $9 for an f'ing tower of onion rings. Gimme a break! You guys need to take that down a notch. I could make 100 onion rings for less than that. How dare you! But I love you, Red Robin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=220

Bryan E.,"Northridge, CA",756,125,333,2.0,10/29/2013,"This was my first trip to Red Robin and I reckon, it will probably be my last. Firstly, I'm not a huge fan of shopping malls. Albeit, the restaurant is actually located in the Northridge Fashion Center, which I didn't know until my friend told me, as we were approaching the mall. She failed to leave out this important detail, when asking me if I wanted to get a bite to eat. She kinda suckered me into to going, telling me how great a place Red Robin is. She obviously, therefore, has eaten at some real shitholes, if she considers this a great place.  I believe her ulterior motive, was just to go clothes shopping. So she slighty engaged in deception, to get me to take her. I was hungry, so I was looking for some food. Since I hadn't been to Red Robin before, I was definitely willing to try it. Had I known it was at a mall, I reckon I would've gotten the flu.  The first thing I noticed was how crappy and congested it was. That was before we actually ate anything, just as we stepped inside. It gets worse. The only way the tables could be closer together would be to stack them. I hate sitting on stranger's laps when I'm eating. If you have no personality, this is definitely the hangout for you. Make sure you take a really good look at the staff on the way in, because that's the last you'll see of them. We just went and sat at the first table we saw that was available. Since the hostess didn't seem that eager to seat us. Just out of curiosity, are the waiters trained to bang into you, as you walk to the restroom? For a moment, I thought I was looking at a picture on the wall, when suddenly it moved, it was our waitress. On this day, the staff was charmingly incompetent. This place probably has a great reputation for those people who don't get out much. I asked the waitress if I could please get a strawberry lemonade, ""Of course, not a problem?"" Well it obviously was a problem, because she brought me a Diet Coke. I know strawberry lemonade and Diet Coke sound exactly the same, but she did write it down, so I thought.  After a long and ardous job of deciding what to eat, I just settled on a chicken breast sandwich and a caesar salad on the side. I figured this should be a safe bet, assuming they cook the chicken. Poor assumption! Unfortunately, they seemed not to have learned yet, that heat is an integral part of the cooking process. This would actually be a really good place to take co-workers you don't like. The food may be awful, but at least the service was slow, they're certainly consistent at something.  My chicken breast sandwich comes with an entire vegetable garden, which would've been fine, if I was either a rabbit or the vegetables were fresh. At least my buns were soggy from all the water on my plate, from the six pounds of veggies they tossed on top of them. They've obviously mastered the art of making a chicken breast sandwich inedible. It's obvious, the food tastes better on the menu. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the strawberry lemonade, and the beautiful artwork on the walls, everything else sucked. BTW: unless you've been to this mall, or know someone who has (thanks Amber), than you'll hopefully never find this place, tucked away in the corner. Anytime a mall tries to hide a restaurant from the customers, that should be a warning! The fellow Yelpers that rated this place 4 & 5 stars, definitely had to be intoxicated or smoking some good shit. Here's a suggestion: just get your customers plastered or high before allowing them to eat. Then they'll give you 10 stars, hopefully before they pass out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=220
Tyler W.,"Burbank, CA",0,5,,1.0,1/10/2016,"Please do not waste your time coming to this restaurant. First off it took 15 minutes to get a waiter/waitress at our table.

This restaurant is VERY unorganized and unprofessional. The service SUCKS the manager is RUDE AND SUCKS. Her name is Joann.

I found myself having too seek out our waiter Chris when I needed something and often noticed him socializing with co-workers.      It's safe to say I DID NOT ENJOY my experience at red robin today. It's really unfortunate because since I am gluten free, I am limited to where I can eat out. I am nervous to go back, but out of the many times I have been there, I have never had a problem.

Marjorie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,1.0,10/11/2015,"Looking forward to trying the new location because we always loved the old one.  I admit it was a Saturday night, which may have contributed to the noise level but what were they thinking when they chose battleship gray for the walls and a totally squared out design in the ""dining room""?  It looked like a prison.  It was a LOUD prison.  As I went to the desk to remove our name from the list, they offered a table outside.  That we could do.  Service was cool as always.  The food is excellent but the initial fries are much smaller than they used to be and the whole burger comes plopped on plastic plate.  Long gone are the baskets and the individual waxed paper that gave some semblance of cleanliness.  The one plus was that the drink refills came out much more quickly than in the old location but it wasn't enough to outweigh the soulless nightmare inside.  We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=240

Lola M.,"Chatsworth, CA",3,25,3,1.0,9/6/2014,"Too many delicious places at the mall for a place to turn out with bad food.  My hubby and I walked immediately to bar area to order, there was 1 couple drinking and waiting for their food, 1 older guy who's already finished his free b day burger and keeps ordering fries. As this older guy is asking her if he can get another order of fries, she puta him on hold and ask as were sitting what would we like to order or do we need a menu, I reply no I know what I want. My hubby went to the restroom, I ordered my food, I paid and I was told 15 mins so I went to restroom. All 3 stalls were occupied so I waited. After a good 7-10 mins I return to the bar where my hubby was waiting.  After returning I noticed another guy there looking thru the menu and drinking a beer from the tap. The bar chic ask if he's ready to order, he replied with a hesitant no and she suggested a simple plain burger. He eventually ordered. A few minutes later he gets his food. We sat a bit longer I ordered a cookie magic milkshake which was good (except she spilled some and filled that missing portion with whip cream). After the guy nearly finished half his burger, my hubby asked if our wait is longer due to it carry out. She said no its all the same but she's checking for our food. Eventually it comes and and I check for freshness. I ordered their ""Famous cheeseburger"" no oinons, Swiss cheese.  1st offense, I waited nearly between 30-45 mins to get my order, 2 O. My fries were so cool to the point they choked you when trying to eat them. I said I'm going to need some fresh fries. If my wait was this long one would assume they'll be hot. Bar chic claimed she just watched them put them in the box. 3 Offense; My patty was the only thing hot, the little lettuce that was on the burger was wilted, along with the tomato, so we're the pickles and the cheese nearly choked me due to them adding extra on the burger that I didn't ask for. This was thee worst burger I've ever all for nearly $10.  The last true offense was that I saw 3 burgers come out prior to mines and their lettuce, tomato, pickles all appeared to be fresh and crisp. What was the problem with mine. I wasn't rude, I smiled and politely answered and ordered, paid walked away and returned. It's times like these that I get upset with myself for not demanding what I paid for.

For $5 bucks it was so filling that I only ate one bite out of my chicken sandwich and ate the fries since there are refills (which I took home). LOL  I have only one complaint though.

Andrea C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1032,319,1497,2.0,9/4/2010,"I was not hungry. I did not want this. I just wanted a damn beverage. That's how I stay.  Sadly, my boo thang and his man friend were very hungry. I said 'food court' oh MANY times, and yet we ended up lost, then here.  The mall's maps will mislead you, they will drag you to the 'A' area of the mall, when really, this shit is hidden in a far off corner. That should have been the first sign that the Red Robin was misleading. When we eventually found our way (after confusion, bad directions, and neck-craning), we were seated far in the back and waited a decent amount of time before being greeted by our curly server. Oh, the service. So, being a chain, themed, family restaurant, my expectations are (understandably) not very high, as far as food quality.  Most of these types of restaurants get their food from the same outsourcers and are not notorious for being of the highest caliber. However, they do tend to emphasize service, being a part of a large corporation. That's my standard ratio. Keep this in mind. So I ended up with some psychotic mix of lemonade, raspberry, sprite, and what I believe used to be a lime. Whatever, I'm just trying to stay hydrated.   Food-wise, I ended up with a small cup of french onion soup, which was salty at best, but had decent cheese (which I was happy to find).   However, service was just damn-near offensive. I used to be a server. I cocktailed, I served, I waited, I did the whole I-work-for-tips gig. Here's a secret: if you work for tips, don't be a bitch, and be nice. Be considerate. Anticipate needs. Put in some damn effort.  I don't EVER dip below 18% tips unless service is awful. We didn't even leave 10%, and I feel like she was lucky to get that.  Besides being MIA, she was not paying attention to us, she worked at a snail's pace in getting things that we (POLITELY) asked for, and was just a little pretentious (""Are you done with that?"" *death glare*). I mean, you can't expect that much from a chain restaurant inside a teeny bopper mall, but you should be able to expect better service.

Lon M.,"Canoga Park, CA",1,62,3,1.0,9/10/2015,"Went to this location a couple of times. It was just ok a few times. Got a burger and a patty melt on my first few visits a couple years ago. Place is always loud.  The service, well, it usually sucks pretty bad. I'll spare the details. Upon last visit about 4 months ago, I order the fish & chips which is always really good at the Woodland Hills location. Well, this time the fish was under cooked and totally greasy. So bad the grease went into the fries. Made me sick to my stomach after the first bite. I told the waitress to just take it back and I'm not hungry I just want my money back and she said she'd have to get the manager. Well, she didn't get the manager and handed me the bill and I told her again I'm not paying for it and I had you return it. She gave me a funny look and went, ""Oh, that's right. Ill get the manager."" ERGH! I should have just walked out then. 10mins later, no manager or waitress to be found. So, then the bite of under cooked fish hits my stomach and I had to practically run to the bathroom. I figure after that I will go back to the table and sit down for 2 mins to finish the coke I ordered, and if no manager by then I will just leave. Anyways, on the way out of the bathroom I see the manager helping the servers at the cook station and I pull him aside and tell him the scoop. He apologizes, was very friendly but said he understands and he is totally understaffed and the cooks are not up to par today and he's had lots of complaints. He asks me who the waitress is and I tell him she never told me her name and I don't see her and I haven't seen her but 3 times the entire time. I told him I'm just leaving man and he said ok and sorry again. The waitress seemed like she was totally angry and not in a good mood to say the least. Wan't a pleasant time upon my last visit there and I told myself I won't go back ever to the Northridge mall Red Robin location ever again.  In Wooldand Hills Topanga Mall the service is hit an miss also but the food is usually consistent at least.  I dunno, whenever I've been to any Red Robins, the servers seem like they want to get you in and out of there like a fast food joint.

The longest I've had to wait was about 10 minutes.  I really like the Royal Red Robin and I always get garlic fries. It's bottomless fries so I don't order a side of regular fries since it already comes with the burger. I believe garlic fries are free. That's what a friend of mine told me and last time I went we ordered them and I checked the bill and there weren't any charges for garlic fries! Is it just me who didn't know this? I was simply amazed at this new facts. I'm not sure what the deal is but either way we weren't charged for garlic fries. Their onion rings are very good as well and a small is usually a good portion for two people.  Service is friendly and I never had any complaints about the servers there. Came by and checked up on us every now and then and all I ever had to ask for was the check. Parking is the mall parking lot so it can get crowded sometimes. I usually park in the upper lot because it tends to be less crowded up there and I just take the escalator down to the first floor where Red Robin is.

Yum!"" just for giggles.   So we get there and we are greeted by a perky hostess and we were seated promptly. Our server was a very friendly red head who was very sweet and she was quick with our orders despite the fact that she was the only waitress in the whole restaurant and she had like 8 or 9 tables. I mentioned this because this location definitely goes the extra mile to smile and be courteous also to  make the customers happy. I had the guac burger with bacon and a little mayo and the endless steak fries. They also gave us fries for an appetizer. My burger was moist, seasoned with their great seasoned salt, crisp purple onions, soft bun and some of the best guac that I have ever had at a chain restaurant. It was so satisfying and I even have left overs. Only drawback is that the prices are not that cheap for a burger since they average at 10 dollars for a burger and endless fries.

Crystal L.,"Burbank, CA",24,95,6,2.0,3/19/2012,"I am an alumni of CSUN and still live in the area so despite graduating I still go to Red Robin from time to time. This particular review is about today's visit. My roommate and I were hungry and decided to go to Red Robin for lunch. Came in around 2:30-3PM and since we beat the lunch rush, were seated right away. My roommate told me that he goes pretty regularly and apparently the waitress, Kristi must have noticed too. Homeboy got two free refills of his soda -- without even asking! But I guess Kristi thought I was his girlfriend or something because she never gave me a refill until I asked for one. She made verrrrrry frequent stops at our table to ""check"" on us (aka ogle my roommate). It was hilarious at first because I would answer ""yes we are fine"" and her smile would fade because I was answering, not my roommate. But after a while it got a bit cumbersome.  So the tall white waitress with the plastic black frame glasses... I guess she'll treat you like shit if you show up with a guy she thinks is attractive!  The food this time around, much like the inappropriate service, was abysmal. My roommate ended up not finishing his meal because he bit into his chicken tenders and it was mushy. I didn't end up finishing my burger as the ""special sauce"" they put on my bun started to taste funny.  Once we were done with our meal I asked Kristi if I could make an order to-go. Our haplessly-smitten waitress FINALLY got the clue that my roommate and I were definitely not on a date and was super sweet as pie to me, promptly handing me the menu, all smiles and flowers and shit. (no lie). We grabbed the food when it came out (did't take too long and conversations help pass the time) and left. We didn't even leave the parking lot when my roommate turned to me and asked if my stomach was feeling weird. It was. When we got home I gave my boyfriend his food and after he ate his meal, my boyfriend said his stomach hurt too. My roommate ended up puking for a while as we were pretty sure his chicken tenders were undercooked (mentioned earlier: the chicken was mushy). My boyfriend and I also took a few trips to the bathroom. Hmm Red Robin needs to seriously re-train their cooks! 2 stars for the awkward comedy I watched unfold before my eyes between the our lovestruck waitress and my roommate.  I think I'll only go back again to see if she hits on my roommate for shits and giggles.

Food M.,"NORTHRIDGE, CA",0,9,,1.0,3/24/2016,"I was looking forward to giving this RR a shot.  I brought my son and niece for dinner the other night.  We sat down at a somewhat ""dirty"" table.  Kinda sticky.  We ordered.  The waitress was really nice.  Drinks came quickly.  Food came without silverware or napkins (they weren't on the table when we sat down).  Made our silveware/napkin request.  The kids started eating, but I waited for my silverware to cut my burger.  I waited and waited (10MIN+).  Napkins finally came.  Then, we were told the silverware was being washed, so we'd have to wait for it.   I decided to bite into my (Garden) burger as to not wait anymore.  At this point it was kinda cold~not sure if it was the temperature or not, but the burger was just not so good.  Nobody around to send it back to be heated.  The silverware never came.  I ate about 4 bites of burger and left the rest.  When the waitress finally came she asked if I wanted to take my burger to go.  I explained that I didn't really like it, and then explained that it had gotten cold while I was waiting for a knife (which I still hadn't received).  She just said, ""I'm sorry.""  I paid the bill via the table-top computer pay/game station.  I tipped 15%.  My son and niece encouraged me to speak up and say something to management...gotta love those teens.  On the way out I spoke to a manager who offered me a RR gift card to make up for my bad experience.  I explained I would not be coming back.  I showed her a picture of my uneaten $9+ burger.  She again offered the giftcard.  I asked for a refund of my burger since it was uneaten.  She had to ""go in the back"" to ask someone if she could do that.  I waited and waited and waited.  I almost left.  Finally she came back and said she would refund my credit card for the amount of the burger.  It would take 10 days to see the refund.  I agreed.  Personally, I think they should have covered the whole bill.  No silverware???  Are you kidding me???  Never returning.  Want a burger in Northridge at a restaurant?  You're better off at Islands.  You're even more better off at The Habit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=280

Anna S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,12,,2.0,6/15/2016,"I like red robin. But I will not be going back to this one again. There were multipul issues with my food. I had to send the salad back twice due to getting a ceaser salad when I order a house salad, and my burger came without cheese, even though sharp cheader cheese is one of the ingredients tat makes the burger stand out from the others. It also came with grilled onions instead of crispy onions. The watier brought back my burger with a microwaved slice of tasteless cheese melted on top. The burger was overcooked. Most likley due to being microwaved to quickly melt the cheese on it. There were other issues with my burger as well. I took a few bites and got a to go box because it was going to be free anyway, or so I thought, because I had a birthday burger coupon.  Then i find out that because there is a 20 percent off coupon on my card i can not use my coupon for the free burger, i have to use the other one. I ask to speak with the manager who just kept repeating that there was nothing she could do  regardless of the issues with my food. She was very cold and firm with extreamly poor customer service skills. I have no issue with the waiter, he was nice and just doing his job. He said he explained the concerns with the food to the manager. It left a bad taste in my mouth, both literally and figuratively.

Mom got the clam chowder, bro some good looking burger and me well i wanted something simple clucks and fries nothing crazy.. We had to wait a while for us to get refills, and the ranch for the fries..

My friends find it funny that I eat from the kids menu, but I wasn't that hungry to eat a big burger.  I am still a child at heart, I don't mind eating from the kids menu and what I love most is seeing peoples reaction when I asked for it.   While we waited for the guys to arrive my friends and I entertained ourselves with the kids menu; it has tic tac toe games, you can draw and all these things to keep the child entertained.  The guys came, one of them didn't know what to eat, he asked what was I eating I said I was eating from the kids menu, he thought it was funny but guess who turned out eating from the kids menu?    I got the pepperoni pizza with fries, it might be a small meal but it fills me up and its less than $6 bucks.  If I want more fries I'll just ask my friends to ask for more, that's one of the things that I love from this place the endless fries! The food is pretty good, the burgers are about $10 each.  The host, and both our waitress and waiter were very nice and very attentive filling up our drinks and just making sure everything was ok.

It is always packed there and the wait can be a pain. I get that it is a mall location but I have been to other mall locations and haven't had to wait that long.  I am also not sure if it is how this one is laid out but it is pretty loud in there. You can hear the conversations of most of the tables around you which can be pretty terrifying.  The food is about as good as the others. I have tried a lot of their burgers and my favorites are the Turkey Burger and the Shroom Burger. Their Bruschetta Chicken Sandwich is also pretty tasty but can get pretty messy.  I do miss their Parmesan Fries which they don't offer anymore but their bottomless steak fries are still good. I'm such a Fry whore that any place that offers bottomless fries is a friend of mine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=320

Julie T.,"Glendale, CA",101,307,32,3.0,5/7/2011,"Red Robin is..........Red Robin. It's your typical chain restaurant like islands, tgif, applebee's...you name it. But I find myself ending up here when I feel like a fattening meal at around 9PM. (It's one of those, only 10 mins away ordeal). There are those servers who you don't know if they're dead or alive until they come with the check...and....I think I've only encountered two servers who actually are attentive and seem to enjoy their jobs . I've tried countless things on their menu since I come by every other week. I particularly like the fried zucchini they recently added on their menu. Their onion ring tower is always a go-to appetizer for me. I love that pink-red-ish colored sauce (I still don't know what it's called)! My staple drink is freckled lemonade (just strawberries in lemonade).  The burgers and ""stuff"" is not that special. Like I said...it's typical. It's a place to grab grub when you're at the mall and feeling hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=320
Lauren P.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",1,3,,2.0,11/17/2013,"First and foremost, the only reason why I'm giving this place 2 stars is because of our waiter. Second of all, I have no idea what was going on with the kitchen staff.  I went in with my close friend who had never been to a Red Robin before. Our waiter, Bryan, was amazing, funny, nice and on point with everything. I told him that it was my friend's first time eating there, and that we needed to make it a good and memorable experience. And boy, was it. My friend ordered the smoke and pepper signature burger, medium well, pepper jack cheese and 2 patties. Mind you, it's an extra $4 for the double patty. I ordered the big tavern, well done, no tomatoes. When the food was brought to us, my friend's burger only had 1 patty, cooked well done with the wrong cheese.  When Bryan came back to check up on us, we told him that my friend was missing a patty and that we'd wait for them to correct the order. It'd take about 15 minutes for the patty to cook. While we waited, I bit into my burger and almost threw up. The meat was cooked medium rare. I absolutely hate, hate, hate uncooked meat (with the exception of sushi).  Bryan brought my friend the correct burger and was caught off guard when I told him that mine was wrong too. I really don't like causing problems and I've never had to send food back because it was wrong for whatever reason, but this was ridiculous. I told him that I wasn't going to pay for our food especially since the whole order was done wrong. He said he understood, and went to consult with the general manager. The manager came back, apologized, brought us the correct orders and removed the food from our bill.  Apparently the kitchen staff had been messing up orders all day long. Not good for a Saturday. All I can say is, we won't be coming back and my friend definitely had a memorable experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=320
Charles C.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,86,,1.0,5/5/2015,"So, I live nearby to this location and have been going there since it opened. When it did first open everything was fine, not the Best Red Robin ever, but no major complaints...now things have changed drastically. The service is horrific almost to the point that we almost walked out to see if anyone would say anything. Over the past five visits or so, the service has been quite terrible. It is difficult to place an order,...takes forever to get food,...if you need something (napkin, refills, ""bottomless fries"" LOL), ...you want the Bill....want to PAY your Bill...it is very difficult to flag down a waitress. Each waitress works a specific section and will not help each other out like in other good restaurants...and it is easy to see why. They have cliques within the restaurant, even the managers/supervisors have little groups...it is like watching a reality show on TV :P They do not act like it is a job, they do not work as a team. I have not seen this before in a real workplace...not to this degree. It is really sad. Other customers were having the same problem and we all just looked at each other like what is this?!? ...oh why do we keep going back every other month?

I went yesterday, just to find out the company has changed its policies for the worst service ever. I could no longer order a smaller portion salad, and ended up throwing half of it in the trash. Why should I waste food if I know I don't eat a lot? They also would not allow me to get focaccia bread. They said the focaccia bread is only for the pizza dough. Pizza is only offered for kids! That's very WRONG! Instead they give two sad little pieces of garlic toast. I Don't want something I can make cheaply and easily at home! They got rid of the Splenda a while back, and the cheap crap has no flavor. Why do I need to pay to bring my own??? Customer satisfaction is not a priority for Red Robin.

Joe C.,"Panorama City, CA",286,13,42,4.0,8/17/2010,"I've been going to Red Robin for over 10 years and one thing great about this food chain is that at every Red Robin you visit, you will always get the exact same great quality everywhere, especially when it comes to their burgers. I'm a big fan of their Whiskey River BBQ Burger and I have had it at over 5 different Red Robins from Vegas to Valencia to Topanga and more, and they were all the same.. DELICIOUS. And bottomless steak fries?? who and WHY would anyone complain about that? If there's just 2 of you might as well split a burger and get full off fries if you're in the mood to save some cash. Clam chowder is amazing, EVERY BURGER is amazing, shakes are good, fries are.. BOTTOMLESS, freckled lemonade is perfect and.. BOTTOMLESS. The food is just amazing and the SAME at every single chain!! Hard to believe I know, but you can have my word. The only BAD thing about this one in particular is that it's really a hit or miss when it comes to servers which makes or breaks the whoooole experience. There are nice ones who always check up on you, bring extra fries even when you don't ask, give you refills without asking and also offering your *BOTTOMLESS DRINK TO GO =] (BELIEVE IT.. JUST ASK!!)* But beware of some of them who don't ask and don't even return to the table till like 15 minutes later.. with the f*c%ing check!! a$$h#les..  But good food. Good drinks.

It was busy.. but  we had a attentive waitress, even though she did not hear one of the side dishes my son ordered when she was taking his order earlier. , so that was missing when our food came.. but she quickly brought it out as fast she could once this had been realized... all is forgiven and it was no big deal. My son ordered the Blue Cheese Burger $9.99 and a side of broccolli $1.99 Nik ordered a  Bacon Cheese Burger. $9.99 I ordered the Chick and Riblets dinner. $13.99  Nik says his burger was just ok... He loved the beer most of all...lol I was driving thank goodness, because his beer was 22 oz and all he kept saying for the rest of the day was... "" wow Im' buzzed.""..lol Alex said  his burger was great!....YAY my plan is working!. As far as my meal goes.. Horrible DO NOT ORDER THE RIBLETS PEOPLE... unless your a german shepard and love your bones and marrow. I'm not  sure even how to describe what the hell I was eating.. it was burnt in some parts but  you couldn't  tell because there was so much BBQ sauce on it. You just have some weird crunchy thing in your mouth that I had to take out to examine while in the middle of a chew to make sure what the hell i was eating. .... WHERES THE MEAT???  I guess they dont call it a RIB -let for nothing.. All i had was BBQ riblet bone, if you find meat on it, which will be burnt by the way..you got a bonus!.. BLEH BLEH 2 chicken fingers came with it, I ate one.. it was ok i guess ,but Carl's Jr chicken fingers are waaay better, and that doesnt say a whole lot about goodness, if you get my point. BOTTOM LINE: I knew I had made the wrong choice when I had ordered my meal,  I should have picked door number 2 and took my chances with the shrimp dinner, since I have never had a burnt and dried up piece of shrimp yet!... DANG...  another $13.99 on this lesson learned. One star lost on my dinner, since I liked everything else about the place and everyone else loved their food, so we will be going back..

I'm not sure if the meat is different or a higher grade, but it tasted much better than the past burgers i have had (not that Red Robin ever had bad burgers, it was just better this time) the smokey ketchup was very tasty, savory and strong, Javier even brought an extra side of it! So good i poured some more on! The ciabatta was fresh and soaked up the flavor, cheddar was a nice thick slice for optimal flavor, and plenty of bacon for every bite! i also asked for a side of chipotle ailoi for the fries, though it was an extra cost for a premium sauce, no biggie, but Javier also brought an extra one for my girlfriend! awesome!  the fries were alright this time, not many crispy ones but all had plenty of their seasoning on the fries for extra delicious flavor!  for drinks i got the peach iced tea, sweet refreshing delicious, and girlfriend got the strawberry lemonade, which was fantastic!  literally full of chunks of sweet strawberries and sliced lemons, it was the best strawberry lemonade I've had! lol will definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=340

Why not just give me the regular amount of fries you would have given if I were in a normal restaurant. Our second beef was with the bad service. We were seated in the bar area at the high dining tables. Our server was very nice, very friendly and took our order very promptly.

Melissa G.,"Los Angeles, CA",118,178,3,4.0,2/27/2011,"i enjoy red robin.  i have frequented this location numerous times and every time i go back it's better and better. we never have had to wait for more that 15 minutes for a booth. the service is always friendly and fast.   i always get the strawberry lemonade and what i love about it...free refills. i have tried numerous items from the menu....one of my favorites is the Whiskey River wrap or the BLTA (avacado...which every time i get it, is as fresh as it can get) croissant.   thank you red robin for always being so yummmmmm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=340

Lily P.,"Spokane, WA",63,329,53,2.0,6/15/2008,"We told them we were going to watch a movie - we told them we were in a rush - but we were put in the back and ignored.  If you have to ask someone to find your server that is a problem. Brother got a chili burger, apparently they are cheap on the chili.  I got some overpriced chicken fingers and fries - I really only come for the fries (I love a nice fatty steak fry), niece got a corn dog.  Kids meal's are usually a bargain, this is no exception.  But their crayons are so waxy they hardly work and you only get like 2 colors.  It's the little things...really.  The kids working here are clearly all in high school and they all act like it.  There is no professionalism in jobs like these anymore...no one cares.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=360

Ben R.,"Mission Hills, CA",54,11,,3.0,6/29/2007,"Eating at the Mall?? And it's a chain??? I'm supposed to be a chowhound, a foodie a guy looking for the hidden treasures in LA... well at least in the Valley....but I have to give props when they are earned. Really good burgers, straddling the line between ""gourmet"" and fast food burgers, free, thick, delicious fries and some of the most refreshing (freckled) lemonade evar. It's a little pricey but it is top notch stuff and the Northridge mall location is always swarming with servers so you never have to flag down anyone for help. You aren't going to be reading or studying here. it is kinda noisy with the TVs and bar racket... but then again, why in the world would you be going to the mall to study anyway?!? Don't be an elitist, get thee hither post haste!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=360

A G.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,225,132,1.0,9/11/2009,"Ate there last night and got food poisoning. I think it was either the egg in my burger, or the campfire mayo I used for my fries. I'm never going here again! I was up till 3am, in and out of the restroom. To top it off, I was too sick and dehydrated to go to my IV certification class- not cool.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=360
T C.,"Woodland Hills, CA",1,48,26,4.0,1/9/2010,"I know this place is in the mall, but they have beer, a full bar AND all the sports on TV (the food court doesn't have any of these).  The bartenders are always nice and the food is half decent.  I don't go to the mall much but when I do I come here to have a beer to make shopping a little less tedious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=360
Daniel L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/17/2011,"Ate here this past week and got food poisoning. DO NOT GO. I ordered the Turkey Burger, which I had eaten and enjoyed before at another Red Robin, and shared half of it with my girlfriend. We spent the next 8 hours violently ill and had after-effects for the better part of the next two days. Another member of my party also ate here but did not get sick, so it was the Turkey Burger. STAY AWAY! I will never return to this Red Robin, and likely, any other.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=360
Sandy S.,"San Francisco, CA",25,88,3,3.0,12/19/2007,"I love red so the decor inside looks pretty hip. Anyways to the food: A friend, Tony, got the freckled lemonade and it looked really sweet and refreshing. It was strawberrry lemonade in a twisted martini cup with fres strawberries on the bottom. I better get that next time. For appetizer we had the macho nachos, it was loaded with cheese, sour cream, avocado, onions and other ingredients I cant do not remember. But it was pretty darn good for nachos, just what our stomachs wanted. For entree I had the chicken plate, it was two grilled chicken breasts with a side of salad and two dressings on the side. Ummm I am kind of indifferent about this entree, it was good and it was bad. The chicken didnt seem like it had enough seasoning and well the salad was just plain salad with tortilla chips and ranch dressing.  Anyway the burgers look amazing and next time that is what I am going to get! Oh and the french fries are bottomless, yes FREE REFILLS on french fries!!!! Yup red robin wants us all to get faaattttt!! 3 stars well because I havent tried their burgers",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=360
E. K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,94,2,4.0,2/11/2010,"I don't think I would have ever gone here if it weren't for the fact that every other nearby restaurant had an obscene wait time.  I'm glad they did, this place is delicious.  One of the best burgers I've ever had...I got the A1 Peppercorn burger.  The garlic fries are delish.  I had a chocolate malt too, but it could have used a little more malt, but that's a typical issue with malts.  I don't recommend trying things other than burgers, though the salads looked good...I mean someone on here was reviewing the place based on the cod?  Of course the cod is going to suck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=360
