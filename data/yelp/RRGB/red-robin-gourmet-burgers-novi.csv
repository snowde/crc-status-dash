Laura G.,"South Lyon, MI",0,2,,5.0,1/14/2018,"Best burger I had in the last year! After going to 3 other restaurants tonight on a Sunday at 5pm my Kudos to the management! One restaurant at the mall was closed, the other one didn't open till 5:30, the third one had an icy parking lot and we waited for the hostess for 5 minutes and left. Red Robin was our last hope of the night! Parking lot was cleaned, no Ice! Smiling hostess ready to seat us and very friendly. Bright and welcome atmosphere! Our waiter Heath was awesome! He came over to the table immediately after seated and was very happy and attentive. We ordered Red Robin double burgers with no sauce. Food arrived within 8 minutes. The burgers were perfect! Grilled and delicious and made to order!  Heath checked on us to make sure everything was great. Check delivered and didn't have to ask or find our waiter like most restaurants. Great dinner! We will go here 1st next time!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi
Steve S.,"Ada, MI",363,5,18,1.0,1/1/2018,"The worst.  Andrew the manager has to be one of the worst communicators I have ever experienced. They suffer from any level of professionalism when confronted with issues. Instead of realizing they made a mistake the manager Andrew and our server María missed their opportunity to save the relationship.  Let me make the strongest recommendation to you to not go to this Red Robin.  If these folks were my employees they would be fired tonight because of how bad they performed.   Let me summarize...the worst.  Food was cold, salad was old, dressing looked like it sat out all day, and to top it off they attitude was the worst.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi
Issamar C.,"Dearborn, MI",2,18,7,1.0,11/4/2017,"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. I had already decided not to frequent the Red Robin in Westland because of multiple negative experiences there, but I did not understand that bad service is a franchise wide problem not a local problem. After waiting for our group to be seated for an hour an a half, the hostess and staff took their time cleaning the tables that had been empty for a while and didn't even clean enough tables to seat our whole group. When I let the hostess know that these were not enough seats for our party and asked if the tables adjacent could be cleaned so we could all sit, she became angry and kept repeating ""so your party is more than 20 people then?"" Even though the tables they cleared for us DID NOT fit 20 people in the first place, she kept repeating ""so your party is more than 20 people then?"" as if we were making outrageous demands by asking to have enough tables and chairs for everyone to be seated after waiting AN HOUR AND A HALF. I asked to talk to the manager and although she was trying to be more polite than her employee, it was clear she did not care about the terrible treatment we had experienced. A number of us left after this. After this experience I am DONE with Red Robin as a franchise. It cannot be a coincidence that I have had such bad experiences with them at multiple locations. They need to fix the culture of their franchise if they don't want to keep losing customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi
Scott O.,"Novi, MI",0,62,13,4.0,11/14/2017,"The food here is consistently good. Props to the chef. Chicken fajita and burger were excellent. Fries perfect. Prices good. Service tends to be a bit inexperienced, but they try hard and are very friendly. The manager walked oddly around in the nearly empty place today, and seemed quite aloof. Overall, my impression is good, hard working people in a nice location, in a nice restaurant that's just not well run in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi

The staff really go out of their way to make your experience a good one.    On our last visit here, we had originally planned on going to TGI Friday's but we ended up sitting at our table for over 20 minutes without so much as a ""Hello"" or a ""Be with you shortly"" from our server. Surprising as the restaurant seemed pretty dead.

Jeff W.,"Novi, MI",90,199,56,1.0,4/10/2017,"It amazes me at the ineptness of this place. We have had our share of terrible experiences and a few good ones. However, they are few and far between. The last two times we visited, about 4 months in between, we waited at the front entrance to be greeted. Both times, after 5 minutes of not being acknowledged, we walked out. They really need to fire the entire management team and start over. We have never had a bad experience at the Brighton Red Robin or other locations, but this one sucks. Instead of this place, go to Burger 21 or Bagger Daves or really any other food establishment.

We had the tavern burger and the prime burger.  Both had really tasty toppings and added to the deliciousness of the burger.  Would probably pass on the onion rings, looked good, but average taste, good crunch.

We stopped in for lunch and I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich with buzzard sauce. The chicken was extremely over fried, so fried i couldn't chew it.

The fries that came with our burger were stall, tasting like they'd been in the warmer for a good 1/2 hour.  The burger was fine, but it was noticeably smaller than the gold ol' Red Robin days when they were good.  It was cooked well, though.  My wife got the barbecue chicken wrap, and it was surprisingly tasteless.  Very little barbecue sauce and the meat was unseasoned. I ordered a house margarita, and it also was pretty small.  And didn't taste anything special, although at least it wasn't overly sweet.

I wanted to walk out but had my SIL with me and she really wanted a burger so I stayed. There was food all over the ground, tables not bussed and once the food did come out it was overdone with cold fries. I would have rather gone to McDonald's. Not to mention it wasn't even busy for such a disgusting mess. I will never be back to this location as I fear I would get sick due to the lack of cleanliness.

Keisha L.,"Riverview, FL",0,40,29,2.0,11/23/2016,"This was my second time at this location. I simply wanted a small order of the bottomless fries.  The young lady at the front door greeted and directed me to the bar to place a carry out order. And that is where my issue begins. Typically when you sit at the bar or even at a table, the server greets you and ask for your drink order. Welp.....that was not the case. The bartender, Marc, was standing at the counter counting money from his drawer. This was fine, because I assume this was necessary at the moment. So I sat down and waited.....and waited.....and waited......AND waited. FYI: I'm very patient. No acknowledgement, no eye contact, no welcome to Red Robin, can I get you a drink or menu? Nothing!!  So eventually I was greeted, just not be Marc.  A lady came to the bar area and asked me was I a particular customer here to pick up a carry out. When I stated that I wanted to place an order, she gave me a menu and said ""oh, he will help you with that.""  Marc leaves the area as I look over the menu. He returns and stands by the cash register looking in my direction as if to say hurry up and make up your mind. I place my order, I ask a question, he stares at me and half answers, he gives me my check. Another couple comes in and sits to the left of the bar, directly behind. Good Ole Friendly Marc walks over to their table and says ""Hey guys how's it going. My name is Marc or you can call me super awesome like everyone else does *pause....they all laugh......What can I get for you guys to drink? So I'm thinking, so he is capable of a proper greeting. And here I was thinking I needed to lower my expectations. This was a very poor representation of Red Robin and a great example of what customer service should not look like. Needless to say WE will not be returning to the bar area as long as Marc is doing what he does best. I gave my review two stars because the young lady at the front door was nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi
Charity F.,"Southfield, MI",44,75,102,4.0,4/12/2015,"Came into this location my sisters birthday. With any red robins location you should know that it is a hit or a miss when it comes to the quality of service and food. Luckily for us it was a hit. I ordered my usual shroom burger where I sub the swiss for american, added bacon, and asked for the bacon aoli on the side. I could've sworn the mushrooms use to have a garlicky sauce on them when I ordered this burger before;  but this burger just had plain mushrooms. That weren't even sautéed all the way through. Then again this is red robins so you cant complain too much. Overall I enjoyed my burger and of course the endless fries dipped in ranch makes everything better. My sister ordered for whiskey Burger which she enjoyed. While my mother ordered the red tavern double. My brother had the kids grilled cheese and cleaned his plate. Everything was good.

Lynn H.,"Northville, MI",312,514,291,4.0,1/29/2012,"I'm not a fan of chains in general, but I am a fan of the Red Robin in Novi.  Their service is reliably efficient, their food is reliably tasty, and the atmosphere does not detract (as it does in most chains).  The Whisky BBQ wrap, in particular, is yummy: BBQ chicken, lettuce, tomato, BBQ sauce, and tortilla strips in a spinach wrap make for one good sandwich. And it comes with cantaloupe as well as steak fries, so on my good days I can skip the fries and fill the corners with the cantaloupe, and on my bad days I can enjoy the crispy fries. Hubby and I usually go during happy hour (5-7, M-Th), to take advantage of the drink and appetizer specials.    Oh, and if you want to avoid the kiddies, ask to sit in the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi?start=20
Liz P.,"Clawson, MI",619,1188,2411,4.0,4/7/2014,"I don't come to Red Robin that often, but my mom had her birthday freebie burger so I went with them this past weekend. First off: if you are a garlic fan, ALWAYS opt for the garlic parmesan french fries. They are my favorite part about Red Robin's menu. They have sweet potato fries now which are also very good (and not steak fries either, which surprised me) but the garlic ones are my fave. I did the build your own chicken sandwich, which was a good deal - $7.99 (and 49c extra for the fries) for a sandwich with pickles and BBQ sauce. I like that they have a cheaper option now because I usually don't get cheese and all that stuff on my sandwich anyways.  Service was fine although a little slow at times and rushed at others.

George C.,"Plymouth, MI",1,17,14,2.0,11/18/2015,"Pretty disappointed with this latest visit. It had been about six months since our last trip here, and that experience was pleasant. Food and service were above average. Not so this time around.  Server acted as though we were annoying him. While he was attentive, he was quite impatient. Food came out in decent order, but my son's burger was charred to a crisp. Had to send it back immediately.  My wife's Big Tavern burger was deceptively named; less than a quarter pound and unappealing.  Manager was pleasant and responsive to the burnt burger, and offered a small discount for the trouble.  Oddly enough, our other two sons enjoyed the carry out food we brought home for them.  Too many other choices for food these days.

Pete S.,"El Paso, TX",0,7,,2.0,4/22/2016,"First time and last time I will come here. It isnt necessarily the price or the food as Ive dropped 150-200 on a meal for two several times without batting an eye, it was all about the expectations here.  When I saw several items on the menu had the ""bottomless"" concept, I thought it was pretty interesting. The catch, however, was the initial bottomless fries was small portion, then when I asked for a refill, it took 15-20 minutes to get it. One would think a restaurant with this concept would have plenty prepared ahead of time and make the fast refills a priority. I just had a feeling of being lied to and cheated. Second, the regular size burgers were one of the smallest Ive ever seen at a dine-in restaurant. It is basically the size of a Mcdouble with some toppings. The plate that was brought to me looked pathetic, seemed like a fast calibre meal and not a gourmet burger joint. The place had decent amount of people, I guess they must like something about it, it just wasnt for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi?start=20

Kudos to the waitress that helped us fix it since again we couldn't not find the server responsible for our table.  I ordered the bleu burger which was pretty good but nothing spectacular.

I'm not the fun police and I think everyone should be able to enjoy their jobs, but flipping off your coworker in front of customers or loudly telling an inappropriate story left me feeling like no one really cared about their jobs. Our waiter was very nice and attentive but when he asked how we liked our burgers cooked and we said ""rare"" he told us they had to cook them to a certain internal temperature. So why even ask? They came out well done. There was barely any arugula on mine so I asked for more. I was brought a greasy cup of arugula with grease also on the pieces on top. Who put that in a cup??

Today was no exception. There are always plenty of business people here, which can be a little weird sometimes since I have my one-year-old always in tow.  Today my son behaved pretty darn well (at least no screaming, which is always a good goal). He left a slew of cheerios everywhere, but our waitress, Shannon, said it came with the territory and not to worry about it. When someone I assume was the manager came to see how we were doing, I apologized to her for the mess, and she said there were plenty of people she had to take care of it. They were both very nice. Our meals were great, and Shannon even brought an extra piece of bread with my salad when I said my son would just eat my bread. Our drinks were never empty, and several people stopped by to see how we were doing throughout the meal. The true above-and-beyond service came when I left my childless friend with my son and bolted to the bathroom. He's at that age where he has a bit of separation anxiety, and he panicked when I left. Not only did no one complain (I was pretty darn fast), but Shannon even sat down and played peek-a-boo to help my friend out while I was gone.

Alex T.,"Livonia, MI",34,235,5,5.0,1/18/2013,"Red Robin has been one of my favorite restaurants in Novi since it opened in Novi about 20 years ago. Yes it is a chain, and with that in mind, there isn't much better.  Red Robin consistently serves up an excellent burger.  One that is balanced in both flavor and size.  My favorite is the Royal Red Robin Burger w/o mayo. The steak fries are awesome...my favorite after Five Guys and Penn Station.  The fact that they're bottomless makes things even better.  Just sprinkle some of Red Robin's special seasoning blend on them and you're good to go. Since Novi isn't exactly the place to find great local eateries, I highly recommend Red Robin. One last thing.  Since this location is on the older side, I think it has a much better atmosphere.  Most of the new ones are laid out in one big rectangle with minimal walls dividing different seating areas.  This restaurant has many different ""rooms"" separated with lots of walls and props.  It really adds to the feel when compared to the newer design.  When I think about it more, it must have been in order to divide the smoking section from the rest of the place before the smoking ban.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi?start=20

Needless to say I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone and will not be returning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi?start=40
Joe M.,"Northville, MI",1,35,1,5.0,6/14/2015,What a great happy hour.  After 9pm.    Where else can you get an ice cold tall beer for only 2 dollars.   And all the free refills on fries that you want.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi?start=40
N. T.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",12,15,2,2.0,4/28/2016,Every trip back gets worse and worse. Bad service. Cold food. Cheap fish. I used to crave the bonsai burger. I'll make my own after this. Bottomless fries? Initial serving of 7 fries with one clump of garlic parmesan in the center. Disappointed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi?start=40
Shannon B.,"Plymouth Charter Township, MI",40,131,22,3.0,6/29/2013,"Please keep in mind that I visited this location twice, with a VERY large group of people. Seating wasn't really an issue here, luckily! While the food that was received was delicious, it did take some of us over an hour to get our meals after we ordered. To me, this is a bit excessive, even with a large group of people.  My biggest complaint would be that of the management on 6/27/13 from 8:30-10:30pm. Within our large group, 2 ordered were lost in translation, which was fine by us...because mistakes happen. While the 2 meals were comped and deserts were offered to those 2 customers...the manager on duty (female, blonde hair) was highly unprofessional about the situation. While we have no idea what actually happened behind closed doors, we did see that the manager yelled/spoke down to/reprimanded the waitress right in front of us. BIG NO-NO!  In a nutshell.. Food = good Staff = good Management = POOR!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi?start=40
Betty B.,"Farmington Hills, MI",22,166,2,1.0,9/7/2015,Usually good but today was a wreck.   It took forever to get our food but as soon as we sat down they asked about drink orders. We had just sat down.  Stay away from the romaine salad.  It was grilled and one big stalk.   It was a bad experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi?start=40
Laurie B.,"Columbus, NC",6,172,9,2.0,9/27/2014,"We keep thinking we like the food at this chain and yet, are never very happy with our dishes.  Hubby had a whiskey BBQ burger, I had a SW pasta dish.  The side salad was the best part of the meal.  My dish was bland and tasteless even after adding salt and ranch dressing to it.  Fries were sorta like eating stale bread.  The second they cooled down, that was it.  No sweet tea and their tea flavors were not good tasting.   It was a waste if $30.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi?start=40
Mark D.,"Commerce, MI",4,8,,2.0,2/22/2014,"Bottomless Fries are a joke. My burger came with 7 - yes, seven! - fries. We immediately ordered more. The waiter stopped by 10 minutes later and said fries were coming out slow because they ""got busy"". 20 minutes, still no fries. He apologized and offered to get us a bunch to go.  My party melt was run of the mill, nothing special, not worth $9 ... even with 7 fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi?start=40
Cathleen S.,"Washington, MI",0,12,3,1.0,9/20/2015,"The staff was horrible; much more focused on cleaning than service.  No one greeted us so we went to sit in the bar.  Every time we spoke to the bartender, he finished what he was cleaning before taking our order, getting our drinks, etc.  We were on the way home from a long drive and really regretted going to Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi?start=40
Some N.,"Wixom, MI",0,17,,4.0,4/18/2015,"Years ago, this place suffered from some of the worst customer service I'd ever experienced. Or rather, my mom put up with it, me just being a kid. We haven't been back for a long time but now that we have, they've clearly stepped up their game.I hate that they've named their chicken fingers the ""clucks and fries"" because it's emasculating to utter that phrase but they're very good and should sate any child. Their wraps were above average as well as their burgers. In the several times I've gone this past year, I haven't had a single problem unlike all those years ago when my mother went nuts at the service. That said, this seems *just* a bit overpriced to be a real 5/5 value. Don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic goto location but it cuts just a bit too deep into the wallet for the food they're dishing out. Also, watch out for their bottomless fries, as they are literally bottomless. I tried to pick it up to move the small bucket further down my plate and the fries came spilling out of the lack of a bottom of the bucket. Cruel pun. Cruel.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi?start=40
Georgiana O.,"Wixom, MI",38,73,279,4.0,8/26/2011,I have to say Red Robin rocks..always great burgers and soups.....for a chain i would go back...great service too!!...thanks peter..;-),https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi?start=40
Rachel H.,"Novi, MI",53,5,,2.0,8/25/2012,"My experience at Red Robin in Novi wasn't a good one. I felt the menu was very limited in selection and I wish they had more of a variety such as chicken tenders, salads, etc. I remembered going a few years ago and they had chicken tenders on their menu. Not anymore. I was disappointed, so I ordered plain burger, and I was less than impressed. My burger didn't have any flavor and I felt like it wasn't cooked medium well. I thought it was burnt on the outside and my burger looked rare or medium rare. There was not an ounce of seasoning in that burger. Major no-no from me. The fries were not seasoned either. I will not be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi?start=40
Josh W.,"Ann Arbor, MI",112,253,12,2.0,3/15/2012,My experience here was kinda crappy. More due to the cooking staff then the server. Our food took forever and came out lukewarm. I also had a digital coupon on my smart phone and the manager had no idea what to do and freaked out.  I'll pass on this location in the future.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi?start=40
Paula K.,"Boynton Beach, FL",78,115,37,2.0,5/26/2012,"After eating at the Red Robin in Brighton, MI about a week prior to this we decided to go to the Red Robin in Novi and we brought our son along.  It was ""magician night"" although I never saw a magician. There was no wait for a table but I have never seen so many empty dirty tables in any restaurant at one given time. In all, there were maybe a dozen active tables. We ordered the Tavern Burgers and my son actually wanted more of the bottomless fries however our waitress, Dakota never bothered to come back so we did not even get refills on our drinks. The food was delivered by someone else and we never saw our waitress other than her taking the order and bringing the check. We had planned to get desert but skipped it due to poor service, why stay longer? Anyway, the food was ok but was much better at the other location. I am certain that we will not ever bother to return to this location again. ( If you are local, go to the Brighton location and you will have a MUCH better experience all the way around )",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi?start=40
Rob F.,"Walled Lake, MI",25,108,45,4.0,6/4/2009,Consistent is the perfect word.  Always clean with good service and acceptable food.  Good menu and a comfortable place to go back to when you want a fallback lunch or dinner. Probably exactly the same as all Red Robins...but that's a good thing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi?start=40
Carrie K.,"Farmington, MI",61,81,6,5.0,2/19/2009,"Consistant!  There's never any suprises at Red Robin which is good.  It's a family atmophere where the food and service is always spot on!   I love the Whiskey River BBQ chicken sandwich.  As always, the drippier the better which is why they wrap their sandwiches and burgers in paper for easier handling.  And the bottomless fries are SO good! In reference to Adrienne's review, when you sign up for either email's you can register yourself as well as all your family members to get a free birthday meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi?start=40
Mary M.,"Rochester, MI",9,28,4,2.0,5/10/2011,"This by far was the worse Red Robin that I have been too.  Two friends and I went there for dinner on Saturday.  We had a waitress that completely ignored us.  My one friend ordered chicken tortilla soup expecting it to come out before our main meals seeing how it was billed as a starter and that is how other Red Robins (Commerce Township) operate.  The soup came out with our dinner.  I ordered a burger (can't remember which one) but with no bun and for it to be cooked medium well.  It came out just barely medium.  We had to find a manager to get action taken on it.  Red Robin cooked me a whole new burger and basically brought out a brand new order including fries.  While this was great, their wait staff should put in for the correct cook temperature the first time if they are going to ask ""how do you want your burger cooked.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi?start=40

We were in there on March 21st 2014.  They made my food completely wrong, spilled some of my girlfriends meal on the floor and never replaced it or even cleaned it up. They never brought us a refill on our drinks or fries. I personally will never eat there again! I recommend that if you don't want terrible food and service that you stay far away from this one!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi?start=40
