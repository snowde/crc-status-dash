Richard L.,"Anaheim, CA",330,54,26,5.0,11/24/2017,Great friendly service! Our server offered us some fries as we waited for our food.

They always welcome us with a smile, and remember exactly who we are every time we come in. Always fun to come in and see which Server will serve us that day.

Patrick W.,"Orange, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/7/2017,"We have been enjoying Red Robin for at least 14 years.. The food is always exactly as ordered and the sit down service is always great. The problem comes in when you order online for pick up... The two times we have done it, they forget items, the wait after arriving at the suggested pick up time the first time was almost 1 hour and this time tonight was over an hour and a half... Each time we asked, we were told they were working on our order... The first time, our food sat on the back counter and we kept asking them to check if that was ours and they kept saying it wasn't... After waiting for the hour, I went behind the counter and saw that it was ours... They said sorry, handed the bags to us and proceeded to forget the shakes that were ordered as well.  The second time, tonight's order, was almost the same story except they didn't bring the food out and leave it, it stayed in the back and sat... The reason I know both times the food sat is because all of the meals ($90 worth of food) was cold, all of it... So, ordering for pick up will never happen again for my family. Like I stated, if you are eating in the food and service are terrific... Avoid the take out idea....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=20

Jessica O.,"Orange, CA",44,36,11,3.0,6/27/2017,"Review update: after my initial post, I received a message from Management inviting us back for free stuff. I didn't take them up on their offer. However, we have been back twice recently. One thing I can say is that I am happy that they installed digital menus in the bar that are equipped with payment stations so it makes paying by a lot easier when you are ready to leave.  This is an unfortunate necessity at this location because it would otherwise take an excessive amount of time to get your tab from the bartender. This doesn't represent the service of the bartender, they are simple too overwhelmed to handle the entire bar and seating area in the bar along with drinks for the whole restaurant. I can understand having one bartender during the slow times but the bartender seemed to be way too busy to handle everything himself. He took it all in stride and all of our interactions were pleasant. I actually feel bad for him.  Long story short, expect to wait an extended amount of time for your food and drinks if you sit in the bar area.  The food is ok for what it is and I can appreciate the good happy hour that they have.  Walked in, sat at the bar. No bartender anywhere in sight. Ended up leaving 5-7 minutes later after no acknowledgement from anyone and no bartender showing up.  Sorry but won't be going back for that experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=20

Samantha S.,"Anaheim, CA",2,12,2,5.0,8/17/2017,"I use to not be the biggest fan of Red Robin a few years back. However, they updated their menu to have a wide variety of new burgers and other entrees and I couldn't be more pleased! I love coming here for a great burger. I usually switch off between the bacon cheeseburger and smoke pepper burger. The best part of the experience is the endless fries! We always order them as an appetizer and snack on the fries until our meals come out.

Peg P.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,10,,5.0,7/28/2017,"Five stars and a BIG SHOUT OUT to APRIL, our server at Red Robin at THE VILLAGE Mall in Orange. We were met with enthusiasm and a great disposition and she immediately tended to the needs of my grandsons by providing games for them. April is the kind of person that does well working with the public. I noticed her tending to other patrons with the same courtesy and enthusiasm; she is a natural! Our food was yummy and everything came in a timely manner, making lunch with my daughter and grandsons an enjoyable success!

Steven S.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",11,45,38,5.0,6/8/2017,"So this was my first time at Red Robin's in probably 8 years. The food was bomb!!! I had the smoke and pepper burger (might've just gotten the name wrong tho lol), it had aged extra cheddar, angus meat, and peppered bacon...... was amazing! No joke. Was seriously impressed by this burger! Also.... we had the pleasure of having April help us and she was one of the best servers I've ever had. We were a party of 11 and 2 kids and she got the order right!!! lol seriously impressed by her.

Jason B.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",139,178,3,2.0,3/27/2017,I have fond memories here of steak fries and decent burgers for a chain and it appears as of now Red Robin will only live in my memories as I doubt I'll be back. Couldn't tell if my server was more concerned with making us use the iPad on table or if we were just seated in the Bermuda triangle of no service but either way we were stranded. When food finally did come out it felt like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for at least 20 minutes... You know that warm but not hot or fresh taste that everyone loves. Anyhow it looks like they've had a makeover and aren't stuck in the 90s...Too bad service was better then.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=20

Carina R.,"Garden Grove, CA",18,4,10,1.0,5/11/2017,"First, we stopped by during lunch time. There was no one there to greet us as we arrived. We had to search for someone to know we were there. Not busy at all yet some how the fries took forever and were warm and soft not hot. Once we asked for our second set of fries the same warm soft fries came out. After having our burgers brought out with semi warm fries AGAIN, our friends and us felt a bit sick after. Will not be picking this location again! South Coast location in Santa Ana is worth the drive!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=20
Virginia C.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/4/2017,"Went in last night about 8:15 and sat in the bar area. Place was not busy and service was slow. Husband ordered fish and chips with a beer, I ordered soup and salad, and a glass of wine. Fish was a little overcooked and very little fries. Good thing the fries are bottomless, problem was he was never asked if he wanted more. When we finally flagged someone down to ask for more, we never received them. Waitress who didn't wait on us apologized and  someone, I think he was the manager, never told us who he was offered us some fries for take home. Really, like I want to take some home so I can eat them cold. My soup was French Onion and only 2 positive things that could be said about it was the cheese and it was hot. It was a bit on the salty side. They should not say bottomless fries unless they keep to their word. This is not the first time this has happened and I am sure that it won't be the last. This place is hit and miss, last night was a huge miss for us, so disappointing, we only so our waitress once, I couldn't even remember who she was. I stop by every so often because it is near my place of employment and we can get seated right away, like I wrote, it is not very busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=20

BettyLou H.,"Irvine, CA",160,180,8,3.0,6/11/2016,I ordered a double hamburger thinking it would be a Red Robin regular burger with double the meat but was given a hamburger that had two four ounce patties and was very disappointed. I didn't know that they have two different patties sizes.  For close to $10.00 I would have never guessed that I was ordering the small size patties. It was very disappointing for me. Everyone else in my party was happy since they didn't  order what I did.

Noora T.,"Orange, CA",55,8,,1.0,8/3/2016,"I am very very disappointed in not only the quality of the food but the customer service.I went before rush hour so there were barely any people inside.  They started us with a basket of cold fries and I ordered the cod burger which had no flavor, plus all of the drinks tasted like they came right from the toilet.  As we were leaving all the workers were occupied blabbing to each other about there social lives rather than being concerned about my service.  I would give it a zero if I had the option which is a shame because I generally love red robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=40
Briana F.,"Huntington Beach, CA",157,47,7,3.0,2/8/2017,"The other night my boyfriend and I came for dinner we also brought our 7 week old son in his car seat. We were immediately greeted by the hostess and asked what table we would prefer since we had a carseat with us, it was a positive greeting that's for sure! The waitress was very friendly as well ,unfortunately I didn't catch her name. The thing that bummed me out was we ordered an appetizer which ended up coming out at the same exact time as our order so it kind of defeated the purpose. I ordered the Bleu Ribbon Burger which was ok I wasn't that crazy about it, I felt like the tangy sauce on it wasn't very good. I would probably give this place another shot because the staff was so nice but I'll explore the menu a little more !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=40

All of the Red Robin's chains that I've been to have consistently had great service and food and this one was no exception. My go to fav is the bonzai burger with a gardenburger, and it is soo good!

Tyler J.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/4/2017,"What an absolute diasspointment. We arrived and ordered before parties arrived, yet somehow they got their food and bill before we got ours. When we did get ours, the order was barely warm, missing food, we had to ask for napkins and silverware, and no one checked in with us once. The only redeeming part was the shake. Everything else, the service, the food, was terrible. They forgot an appetizer, so we had to ask about it and they brought it out cold after we already finished our meal.

Bethany A.,"Orange, CA",260,53,17,4.0,6/2/2016,"I love Red Robin!!! This is my go to place for delicious fries and a a spicy burger. My favorite burger is the Burnin' Love! Delicious!!! With bottomless fries?!? Yes please. If you like to add a kick to your fries then dip your fries in buzzard sauce and ranch. So good.  If you're looking for something lighter, the croissant turkey sandwich is my next favorite. I'm very picky about croissants and this is soft and fluffy.  I love the redo inside the restaurant! It feels less chaotic.  Definitely a great place to go!  PS...sign up for the red royalty rewards and get a free burger the month of your birthday, plus after 10 burgers you get one free!

Christine A.,"Placentia, CA",0,3,1,1.0,8/4/2016,"*****VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE***** As my family and I walked in and stood in front of the hostesses for a few seconds, one hostess briefly looked at me and abruptly said, ""GIVE US 5MINS"" as if we were bothering them by interrupting their conversation.  There was NO warm welcome as we entered... NO...Hello, Welcome to Red Robin  NO...eye contact  NO...smile on the hostesses faces and NO...explanation as to why we needed to wait 5mins We were basically dissmissed as they continued with their conversation. As we sat down waiting to be seated, we  noticed that the restaurant was NOT busy. There were 4 people at the bar and 5 families eating in the restaurant. First impressions go a long way AND start with the hostesses.  Unfortunately, these two ladies have very poor customer service skills. Not sure if this issue is due to lack of management,  lack of training or if these ladies really do not care about ""Customer Service"" After being ignored for 2 1/2 mins, we walked out.

It took her pretty much my whole 30-minute lunch period to just place my order today that I had to go back to work and pick up my food after I was off, I don't think she quite understands the meaning of the word ""now"". Maybe don't say ""now"" and say ""in several more minutes"" instead? Also, my order was wrong and I didn't receive everything that I ordered. She didn't even apologize for the long wait either. Instead, her co-worker apologized to me as he could see how pissed off I was.

I'm saying this because when my fiancé and I went our food was not that great. I ordered the Burnin Love burger with a Boca Patty and my fiancé got the Pineapple one ( I forgot the name). When I got my burger it looked pretty good but when I took my first bite my patty was hard. I don't think they cooked it all they way because only the middle was warm and soft but the rest of it was hard still. I just tried to eat my burger without the boca patty but I just ended up being grossed out and not eating it at all. I could have complained but I didn't want to wait for another burger since it had taken longer than usual to get it so I didn't say anything.

Not sure what it was but something from the bar area we approached the bar with bewilderment and look at the bartender in the eyes however he would not look at us he looked away made us feel as though we were unwelcomed..We asked if we could please sit down to have a meal and he said we are closing. We looked at our watch but its 9:20 . He  rude and didn't accommodate at all as a matter fact made us feel quite awkward.

I had the prime chophouse with was a great idea but didn't have as much horseradish as I'd have liked.   I guess I need to experiment more with their dipping sauces for the fries as the Thai sauce just didn't work for me.

It means a lot when a restaurant not only appreciates a regular customer but when they appreciate a vet that's a different kinda of customer service. Thank you Red Robin and thank you for showing the troops some love.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=80

There was a waiter that decided to take a tray full of drinks and spilled it all over right by us. He then handed one drink as it was dripping with the other people's drink. He did not even clean it up himself, but someone else had to clean up his mess. So many drinks had spilled, it made my booth sticky. I was not impressed with this waiter. I have not seen him since, so hopefully he was fired. It was not that he spilled the drinks, it was the lack of responsibility he took.

My all time favorite is the royal red robin burger.  There's just something about the egg that I love.  Also the endless steak fries are the best. When I say good service.....I mean when I walk in the door I get greeted.  And then the servers are prompt.... In this particular occasion the egg was undercooked and the yolk leaked over the bottom of the bun and caused it to be soggy.  I told the server and they replaced my burger right away.  Some businesses you just dont get that kind of service.

Its not that bad but its nothing that is spectacular My last experience in here was not a good one. I came in on Labor Day at about 6ish. It was pretty busy and my group of 4 decided we would just sit at table in the bar area.  Now keep in mind the bar area has booths and tables so we grabbed an open table cause we were starving. My wife had our 2 month old in a ring sling sleeping up against her. We were told that we had to move because the bar is 21 and over. REALLY??? We were not sitting at the actual bar top. If that was the case I understand but come on. What is my 2 month old gonna sneak in a mojito or a shot of whiskey? This is not freaking Pauls or Marty's, Red Robin you need to lighten up.  We had to move which resulted in us having to wait for a table for another 15 minutes. Just not a great experience.

Brandon M.,"Fullerton, CA",24,153,7,2.0,6/13/2015,"Came here for my first time last night (Friday the 12th). Right off the bat this location grabbed my interest due to its larger size and unique layout. I usually go to the Brea location, so this was something a little different (despite being the same restaurant)... My party was greeted upon arrival and waited roughly 10 minutes for a seat. I saw quite a few open seats, but didn't feel the need to question the hostess's seating techniques. Once we got our seats, it was only a few minutes before our waitress, Alyssa, came by. She was/is extremely attractive (just had to put that out there), but unfortunately very inattentive to our table. Took a while to get our water cups, order food, get refills, etc - the whole meal basically lagged. Then to top it off, we asked for our separate bills so we could pay and leave, and that also took forever. Once we got them, we slipped our cards with our respective bills hoping she would take them back quickly, but of course that didn't happen. I did notice Alyssa was constantly bouncing around in the bar area, so her attention seemed more focused around there. This location should reconsider bar employees also being table waiters away from the bar, as that doesn't seem to be working. While I would normally suspect slower service on a busy and/or understaffed day (which is the common excuse), it was nothing like that. There were plenty of employees working that night, and it was not busy (compared to say, a saturday evening).. The food was ok. I got my personal favorite, the royal red robin burger. While it wasn't terrible, it definitely wasn't up to standard. There was a ridiculous amount of mayonnaise on it. Others in my party complained that their food was undercooked, and the fries tasted as though they had been sitting for quite some time (not even warm by the time they got to us). With all this considered, I cant say I was too impressed with this location or the food. They have some ghetto looking females working at this spot (not including Alyssa), and while the location itself is pretty nice - the food and poor service kills it for me. Maybe we came on a bad night, but seeing other recent reviews tells me I am not the only one.. Perhaps with a little motivation, the managers/employees can get a better routine down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=60

The Village of Orange is pretty busy, especially on weekends, but finding a restaurant where picking up food is quick and easy is quite the find. With a ""10 minute parking"" for picking up food (or ""30 minute parking"" when the 10 minute parking spots are full), we really like this added convenience. Whether we eat here or take food to go, the service is also really good here! While my husband usually gets a salad, I usually order the Whiskey River Chicken Burger. It's messy and delicious. With the just the right amount of barbecue sauce, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onions on this burger, I am perfectly content after my meal here. Add some of the best onion rings ever, and I'm in heaven! My husband's salads are always hearty and delicious as well.

Been to numerous different locations more times than I can count, but was disappointed with the things we ordered here tonight. Service was good, which it should have been since we were one of about 5 people eating in the whole place tonight (never seen it so dead in here), and got a nacho appetizer with no cheese on it; chips covered in sour cream and chili, but had no cheese for some reason, and if I'm understanding the concept of nachos here, THEY SHOULD HAVE CHEESE. The chili was kinda gross too. We then I ordered fries with American cheese, thousand island dressing and bacon bits, and even that was bad. They put down the fries, then the Thousand Island, then melted the cheese on top of that making it all a soggy mess. They call it dressing because it goes on last...it goes fries, cheese, then dressing.  I'm sorry to say the food here at this visit sucked. I will go back to Red Robin based on many past meals here that were pretty good...I don't expect 5 star fare here, but Red Robin has always been good for what it is....decent food and decent prices, and they have a bar which puts them ahead of Denny's or Carrows, but this was a disappointing visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=100
Mike M.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,72,,2.0,6/21/2015,"The food is good - a solid 3 - but the new salt shakers usually feel like they have some kind of grease on them. Unfortunately, they're now the TWIST kind, so you have to grab them with both hands and get BOTH hands greasy to get salt or pepper on the food. I actually had to wipe down the one we used today before it was fit to use.  Hence the 2 star rating. Also, no toothpicks.  I'm getting kind of tired of this.

I got this ring mold of fries and when I asked for a refill. .the ""basket"" literally had 10 fries in it..all the hard small crunchy pieces! Wtf?! BRING BACK THE CHEAPY LOOKING BASKET WITH THE MOUND OF FRIES!  I had the bleu ribbon burger.. which was good but no $10.49 good! My hubby was Pissed to know that when you order the Red's Big Tavern burger.. the "" bigger"" burger is actually a normal sized single patty.. SINGLE! So that's why they hid the pic of the burger behind the regular Tavern burger. Btw, the regular Tavern burger may have two patties, but they are smaller than the normal size patties!  Shouldn't you say that in the description on the menu? All in all.. food was good, service was good. .but the lack of refill fries and price just aren't worth it to come back, especially for people on a budget. Oh, and I don't like the rush of putting my check in front of me so I can pay and the waiter can move on to priority tables... maybe I wanted another round of 10 fries!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=100

Cool technology on each table to allow you to order, call for waiter or even pay by card.  We ordered two burgers and a endless French fries basket.  Burger was cooked exactly as ordered and was flavored very well. All the ingredients tasted fresh and of good quality.  The steak fries were delicious, can't find steak fries to many places anymore so it was really nice to be able to get them here like a good old classic diner.  The waiter went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of and we always had fries and full drinks on our table.

My sister came over last week and we trying to figure out what we wanted for dinner, I'm a creature of comfort so I go to the same places LOL! She mentioned going to RR since it's so close to our house, we came in around 8ish on a Sunday night and it was perfect! The dinner rush was over and there was no wait! First off the menu is HUGE!! It took us a good minute to go over it, we really couldn't make  up our mind! We did have an amazing server named Allison, she was on point! She knew her stuff and remembered everything! She got our order right and never forgot anything! If you don't find anything on this menu then something is wrong with you! We started with the chicken wings and they are delicious!! Super crispy and tasty! These rank pretty high up with there with some of our favorite spots! My sister ordered a non burger LOL, a crossiant turkey sandwich with bacon, and avocado, my mom kept it simple with a double tavern burger and coleslaw. All of us enjoyed our food so much! It was delicious! I took my food home to go and ate it later and it was crack! My favorite was the chili! It has a good flavor to it, not too spicy or bland. I ate almost the whole cup it was that good! I took home a kids meal and a side of mac and cheese, I was a bit disappointed with the mac, it was bland and lacking flavor which I was surprised because everything else was so flavorful and on point!

Now, let's get down to business! * Onion tower! Served with their something campfire sauce and ranch. These come in two sizes but you will notice the differences on the menu because one clearly states ""shorty"" on the side. It's a simple concept of appetizer but that campfire sauce.... pairs it very nicely!  *Bottomless fries! Okay, let's try not to get too crazy here! Although the fries does not come seasoned, there is a seasoning bottle on your table next to the ketchup which will enhance the flavor. I pair the fries with honey mustard because that just makes sense. Many many choices to choose from. If you're not a huge burger with beef patty person, they offer chicken sandwiches and if you're that ""kale salad only"" type of person (boo), then they also have salad options in the back.

Plenty of avocado (unlike in the past where they would give you 1 slice) and loads of chicken and other good stuff. I loved it. Their burgers have totally improved as well. The meat just taste 100 times better...like right off a home BBQ grill. The fact that they give you gluten free bun choice is A+ in my book.

Kieu T.,"Irvine, CA",182,116,203,5.0,10/26/2016,"Came here for lunch today because it was close to work and we were on the mood for burgers.  We were greeted immediately upon entering the restaurant. The hostess was prompt in bringing us to our seats. The server came over with waters right after we sat down and came back five minutes later to take our drink orders.  And it arrived five minutes later. We told him we're weren't ready for food orders yet, by check back in a few minutes.   He came back five minutes later and took our orders.  We had their steak fries and onion rings were appetizers. The steak fries were fresh and had a good crunch. The onion rings had the perfect amount of bread/onion. And the dipping sauce was amazing. I ordered the Marco pollo, which is grilled chicken with peppered bacon and arugula. The chicken was cooked well; super juicy. And the bacon was a perfect crisp. I don't remember what everyone else ordered, but everyone enjoyed their burgers. Our drinks were refilled once they were about 1/3 full; which was awesome service. I haven't seen that anywhere else. For dessert, we got their tower of donuts. The diameter of the donuts was about 2.5-3 inches; so a good amount; not too big, not too small. The texture is very similar to a cronut if you've ever had one before. Fluffy and not too fried. All in all, it was a great fast meal.

I had to clean up the milkshake and when I told the waitress Emily about it she said ""oh I'm sorry"". She didn't offer any compensation or anything for a milkshake I didn't get to really have. On top of that they took 20 minutes to get fries out, she told me three times that the fries will be out shortly. When the fries came there was practically nothing in the basket.

Renee M.,"Garden Grove, CA",268,360,499,2.0,10/15/2017,"I was super disappointed today.  We went to Red Robin to celebrate my Mm's birthday.  I was asked to find a place that fir the family friendly criteria,  a place that would be cool if my nephew get loud or has trouble sitting still (he is moderate to severe autistic) and they had to have French fries for afore mentioned nephew and it needed to be in Orange. We all eat pretty healthy, ranging from Vegan to no processed foods to a diabetic diet.  I know they offer a vegan burger patty, salads, soups and fries so it kinda fits all the criteria.  We are greeted ad after a short we are seated.  We ask a few questions of our waiter and order tea's and waters.  Out tea's arrive and the ice had totally melted so the waiter says he will be back with ice for our drinks and takes our order.  I order the Vegi burger, vegan.  Buttercup get a modified version of the same, my mother gets the chicken soups,  my brother a grilled chicken salad and of course chicken nuggets and fries my nephew.  The waiter comes back and informs us that the bun has egg in it so I modify my burger into a lettuce wrap. (still no ice).  About 10 minutes goes by and a waitress comes by to inform us our waiter is going on break and she will take cover for us.  We request some ice and she offers to bring us fresh drink.  She delivers fresh drinks and ice for us soon after our waiter comes by to let us know that he is going on break,  we inform him she has been by and brought us our ice.   Our food is delivered soon after and I have several giant pieces of iceberg lettuce, two slices of tomato a little onion and a few pickles.  There is no way I'm eating this burger style with my hands. So I cut it up and eat it in that manner, I would have been great to have more condiments like tomato and pickle.  I did not want fries so I ordered the freckled fruit kinda wondering what the even meant, well it was just awful. it was the sweetened strawberries that are used in the strawberry lemonade, with what I think was canned pineapple and some orange pieces and apples.  Super disappointing because the strawberry things were a sugar bomb and got all over the rest of the fruit. Basically I left still hungry.  Oh and two members of our party ordered the endless fries, and the portion was small on the initial plate,  when more were requested 1 small plate was brought for my daughter (17) and my nephew (10) to share across the table from each.  Umm ok... Additionally, we were there for a birthday. Based on the gifts at the table, the waiter asked if it was a birthday which we acknowledged with a yes.  I think he forgot to pass that along because the B-day song never happened.   I was a little relieved by this, but still my Mom was disappointed when it was all said and done.  Over all the food was typical chain garbage and the staff, the waiter was terrible and the waitress was a little better.  I give 2 stars for the effort of the chain to offer a vegan patty especially one that isn't the typical black bean patty that you get everywhere and for the waiter who let me know that the bun had eggs in it opposed to just bringing it and not caring.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange

It's just one of those places you end up because one of your friends has a craving specifically for one of their burgers.  Does this sound familiar? Because that is why I ended up at Red Robin. Place was pretty packed for a nondescript Thursday night.  TGIT!  What do vegetarians or pescetarians eat at this joint? Probably the Garden Burger, which is what I got.  It's a veggie patty (Garden burger brand) with lettuce, tomato, pickle, and a mustard sauce.  It wasn't particularly memorable, hence why I did not take a photo of it.  I could have made this at home.  The fries are bottomless + delicious = a combination that makes America overweight (but yolo am I right?). They are unseasoned so you can DIY with the little seasoning shaker they have at the table.  I upended half the shaker onto my fries 'cuz that stuff is powdered gold.  Service was great! Our waitress was incredibly kind and attentive and patient when we all asked for 1,000 dipping sauces for our 1,000,000 fries.   Will I come back? Yes, when my friends force me to. I've been told they can replace any meat burger with the veggie patty.  Maybe I'll give that a go the next time around.  My whole thing with these types of chain restaurants is that they all run together in my memory like watercolors in a white rafting river.  Was this place Applebees? Was I actually at Fridays? Were we at Chili's when I ordered this? Had I not checked in I wouldn't be too sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange

Lina L.,"Garden Grove, CA",1,34,3,2.0,9/26/2014,"I had fond memories of Red Robin back in my high school days when my friends worked there. Meal was big, freckled strawberry was delicious and burger was mouth watering.  My taste buds have either refined or that this Red Robin doesnt believe in quality control. I'm inclined to agree with the latter.  I ordered the bruschetta chicken burger with onion rings while my cousin asked for the smoke and pepper burger with fries. My buns for the burger were abysmal, it seemed like they were stale and lifeless while the chicken tasted very bland. I left over 1/3 of my plate unconsumed. As for my cousin, I have to give props to the menu designer because his burger didn't even resemble the delicious photoshopped image.

Barbara R.,"Ventura, CA",0,17,,1.0,6/17/2015,"This review is about the ""new"" Avo-Cobbo"" salad I had last night.  It was HORRIBLE! Corporate has changed what was the BEST cobb salad around into the WORST cobb salad around.  No more romaine lettuce - now a handful of iceberg with a small dab of spring mix.  Doesn't work on a cobb salad.  They got rid of the eggs and olives.  They are now putting cucumber instead of the egg.  The portion size is less than half of the original salad size.  The ONLY thing that hasn't changed is the chicken.  It is still the same portion and still good.  At BEST maybe a tablespoon of each of the condiments are put on now.  No longer the chibata bread, but two small slices of cheaper buttered / garlic bread.  My guess is that they are trying to make more money.  This is the wrong way of going about it.  Increase the menu price if you have to, but I felt SO ripped off having to pay for that bad tasting garbage last night.  They have lost a VERY loyal customer (I'm in there one to two times a week just for the Avo-Cobbo salad).  I'm angry that I have to go try other restaurants to find another cobb salad that is equal to what Red Robin used to have.  Lazy Dog's cobb salad was pretty good but I don't want to drive that far for dinner from where I am.   The staff at the Orange restaurant are great -- especially Ryan and Emily.  I will miss them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=120

Dawn M.,"Corona, CA",50,42,5,1.0,10/30/2014,"I am a frequent diner at this and the Costa Mesa RR.  Although it's been a couple of months and I cannot believe how this location has gone down hill. My visit was Saturday, October 25th right about noon.  The place was not busy.  I stood at the hostess booth for 3 minutes before she showed up.  Never apologized for the wait, didn't say hello..she said ""how many""?  I said 2 for a booth..she said it's going to be a wait.  Looking around and seeing at least 15 booths available I figured they must be short-handed and said I would wait.  5 minutes later she said she had a booth ready and tried seating us in the bar area.  I told her I don't want to sit in the bar area, I prefer the restaurant.  She said ""this is part of the restaurant""...so then I had to point to the area of the restaurant I was referring to (the part without a bar).  She said ""well it's going to be a wait""...I said fine.  She then turned to the woman waiting for a booth and laughed as she said ""do you have a problem sitting in the bar area, if not I can take you now"".  Such a rude hostess.  The first impression is this girl, who clearly just rolled out of bed and came to work by her appearance.  In face, both hostesses were a sloppy mess.   Finally we get seated.  The service was slow.  When our food arrived, my friends burger was half the size of mine so he asked the lady who brought it over (not our server) and she said ""that is the tavern burger and they are smaller.  He said ""why don't you tell people that because the picture doesn't show that and neither does the price.  Her response ""well we expect that people will read the menu""...REALLY????  Then my friend complains to our server and he just kinda laughed and said yeah that's the way that burger is and you can get unlimited fries in case this doesn't fill you up.  He never came back to the table after that.  For our refills, to see if my friend did want extra fries...never saw him again until he dropped off the bill. I have never had such poor service here.  I did see a manager that I haven't seen before and I always consider poor service a reflection of the manager.  Somebody needs to wake these people up.  I will not return to that location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=140

So much for getting bottomless fries and refills on my Freckled Lemonade. Not once did he ask us if we wanted more fries. I had to ask him for a refill on the lemonade. When I said ""excuse me"" to get his attention, because we needed more napkins, he turned around and replied, ""Yo"". Huh?! He lacked customer service and follow up. We overheard the table behind us debating on whether or not to leave him a tip, as they had to ask him several times for drink refills and more fries. He dropped the bill off and never bothered to ask if we wanted anything else. Any good server will always ask if the customers would be interested in dessert, etc. Very disappointed with his lack of interest. He was just going through the motions and clearly had no desire to provide proper customer service. We deliberately left him a penny tip to make a point.

I order the Whiskey River burger with egg (split in half), and sit outside so I can smell Tuwanda and Juanita smoking their Kool and Kent cigarettes (respectively) at the entrance of the Orange ""Mall,"" or Village or whatever the hell it is while I listen to the cheesy mall music over the loudspeaker, coupled with the squeaky entrance doors that need to be oiled, which add a saxophone-like break to the shitty music.

We were greeted at our table shortly after we were seated and Wilson's gracious demeanor was somewhat of a relief for me, telling me without even saying that it was going to be okay, and that the meal I was set to have would make things better. Which they did; Wilson took the children's order and swiftly returned with their drinks. The rest of our food was brought out in a timely manner as well as every time we asked for something; Wilson gladly brought back what we needed - even if it was the 4th cup of ranch dressing to accompany Red's delicious and bottomless steak fries. All that to say this: thank you to the evening shift's Rockstar - otherwise known as Wilson. Your patience with our very loud table is much appreciated.

We went there for my birthday, as it's an annual tradition. I have never had such poor service in my life at this location..I probably jinxed it with my last review. The new servers are SO RUDE. Anyway, the one we had last night, I will not mention her name, was horrible. She acted as though everything we needed from her was an additional chore. Well you know what, maybe when we ask for it the first time - you could bring it? With a side of less attitude? My burger was made wrong so I sent it back. Then the manager brought it out and I told him the pickles were missing so please can I have them on the side with tartar? He said ""I'll just go tell your server."" NEVER have I had a manager say that to me..whenever there is something wrong, the manager happily brings things out. When we asked the manager for something else last night..again, he acted as though it was a chore for him. WTH? Disappointing.  The server brings out the check. My sister had given her a cake when we got there..so she forgot that, which was no big. So she brings out the cakes..just the cake. What are we going to cut and eat it with? Our hands??? So I'm like ""umm can we have a knife, forks, and some plates?"" She sighs and go gets them.  And my birthday song? So we told them that too.

They gave us fries with just parsley on top when the menu says tossed in garlic.  We got a second one that was better.  My bun was hard and cold I got a raw frie I told her and not even like that the manager dared to stop by. We waited a while for our first drink we had to go to the hoststand because we had food and no silverware we had to ask for refills and it took a while to get them. The busser who was cleaning the bar left the black tray full of dishes in the floor where a guest almost trip over, the whole experience was just not what you hope  for. Maybe you need to retrain your managers on how to manage the floor, deal with guest, and be able to work in different stations like the bar. Very disappointed definitely will think twice before coming in and it's a shame because your food is usually good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=160

My first impression was this place is nice and big the hostess is friendly and its not too busy so that means minimal wait time. So when me and my boyfriend sit down no one notices us were just sitting there talking the waitresses keep walking past us, it took them 10 minutes just to notice us and that's not an excuse because at every single BUSY restaraunt I've been to they've been able to take care of me with no problems , but this waitress seemed to not care too much about her job, she took so long to notice us, and when I asked for a basket of fries there was literally like 5 fries in there so , bottom line worst red Robin experience of my life were defiantly not coming back there again.

I looked back in my youth, I remember Red Robin in far better condition so I guess the restaurant has been changing over time and it wasn't on my top pick as it used to be.  Umm, could it be because of economy crisis and the restaurant has to make a lot of change and cut back?  Could be but fries never fail.  It is very good with unlimited ranch dip upon request.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=160

I am a vegetarian so I ordered the ""burnin love burger"" with a veggie patty It was so gross!! The patty was not the problem, it could have been meat and still taste like shit. There were flimsy, soggy, doughy jalapeño chips on it that was gross. They had tomatoes AND salsa on the burger which tasted so bad. I was so confused as to what was going on in my mouth. It was beyond disgusting. The whole burger was lukewarm on the verge of cold and sloppy. There was also a whole jalapeño stabbed through with a wooden spike on my burger. I guess they tried to get fancy...am I supposed to eat the fucking jalapeño? Why would someone just eat a whole burnt jalapeño? I wanted to exchange the burger, but I didn't want my food spat it. I tried to finish the mess because wasting food is a sin in my culture, but I only made it halfway before I felt too sick to continue.

Tabitha B.,"Orange, CA",177,20,9,1.0,8/16/2011,"This place used to be good back in the 90's.  My husband and I went this last Monday (8.15.2011) around 5pm with our two children, 3 and 1 years old. The hostess make it seem like a chore for us to have TWO high chairs, but whatever. The kids cups leaked and the lids pop off frequently. We had to hold the cups for the kids so they could drink out of them. The server never brought us any coasters (for our drinks and the kids' drinks) either. The burgers were super crappy and when we said we wanted both burgers with ""a little pink"", one came out that looked almost raw. The burger patties themselves looked cheap and overly processed, I wonder how much meat was actually in them. The fries came out cold and we each got about 8 fries per burger... yeah, I know they're bottomless but still a decent sized portion when you first receive them would be nice. The children's food was meh. We spent 47 bucks and totally regretted coming here (we would have paid for our drinks and left after they brought out the sad looking food but the kids were really hungry, yeah, it was THAT bad) and said we would have had a better time across the street at In and Out. The server was nice but constantly forgot things to bring us and dropped the check before he even asked if we wanted dessert, it was my sons birthday and we wanted to order a sunday or something but we figured we should just go somewhere else for desert afterwards.

That said, my absolute favorite thing off the menu is the BBQ Whiskey River Burger. It's perfect.

On to the gluttonous food!   I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ burger (with a Boca patty of course!) it was good, but it needed more BBQ sauce!  BFF got the Santa Fe burger (with a Gardenburger patty)- she said it was really yummy.  BFF's fiance got the fish and chips -- he's sort of a self appointed connoisseur - and he LOVED them.  According to him, they coulda used some HP sauce, but I think we're just spoiled from the Olde Ship!  His friend had some crazy burger with fried jalapenos and that, too, hit the spot.

No, Red Robin is not gourmet, and there are probably hundreds of burger joints that are vastly superior to Red Robin. But are the burgers tasty? Yes. Do they serve delicious chocolate malts and endless fries with ranch dressing and seasoning salt on the side that I can sprinkle to my liking? Yes yes yes yes yes. So  yes, I will suck it up and go to Red Robin and i'll have fun and i'll enjoy a good burger. Such as the shrooms burger which is perfect for any mushroom fan because they load up on mushrooms. The guacamole bacon burger is pretty choice as well. A great perk about their burgers is that they're not horribly enormous, so a petite girl like myself can finish off a burger and not feel like she's got a food baby.  Service was SUPER fast, my boyfriend and I got our burgers in like five minutes. It was 6:30 on a Monday, so not exactly the  busiest of days.  Their fries are sub par but ENDLESS! Yay.  Price is more or less reasonable, like eight-nine bucks for a burger and fries. Compared to other alleged gourmet burger places, this is pretty cheap. I think Islands runs around ten bucks for a burger sans the fries and The Counter (probs my favorite burger place) burgers can be up to twenty bucks if you go crazy with the toppings.

Nicole C.,"Orange, CA",0,15,2,5.0,5/6/2013,"Last night my sister and i had dinner at Red Robin of Orange. And although we didn't have a yelp account we decided to make one. Our waitress Jossie, was most helpful and made our dinning experience so much more. she was professional and personal, it wasnt like she was doing a task but something more, she was very enjoyable. which in return we had a great time. Her service was phenomenal. And the dinner was classic and delicious. Bottomless french fries and burgers, how could you go wrong? We'll definitely be back, to have delicious meal and too see some friendly familiar faces. Thank you Red Robin Yum",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=180
Neil J.,"Chino, CA",96,66,9,3.0,12/4/2010,"We ate here for dinner today and had a good meal.  Nothing exceptional, but we felt it was well worth what we paid for it.  Good appetizers and bottomless steak fries kept the kid happy.  And although I was tempted by the ""Bottomless Root Beer Float"" on the menu, I stuck with my water. The service was incredible and super friendly.  They were really busy and our waitress (Makenzie) stopped by every few minutes to make sure everything was OK.  Even if the food was less than desirable, I would have to give them 3 stars on the service alone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=180
Sunee R.,"Anaheim, CA",0,17,,1.0,8/3/2011,"I left this place 30 bucks poorer and wishing I would have just gone though a fast food drive thru... Waitress was horrible!   Kind of ignored us and kept zipping on by without asking us if we were okay or needed anything.... I ordered the the turkey burger and wasn't very fond of it, but at ten bucks I chowed it down anyway...NOT worth the money.... straight out this place sucked...the burgers were mediocre and honestly any burger off the Carl's Jr menu out does Red Robin's.... Will not be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=180

Nathan A.,"Santa Ana, CA",84,148,90,4.0,6/22/2012,I love the burgers at Red Robin and every Red Robin has had the same quality of food. This is a good sign of chain restaurant that cares about the food that comes out their kitchens. Any burger on the menu will satisfy the carnivore inside you.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=180
Yan F.,"Manhattan, NY",21,272,,4.0,11/17/2011,"Being from the East Coast, I've never tried Red Robin before. Keep in mind I've never seen one from where I was from and I have to say that this is a rather nice restaurant for burgers and the usual American food.  I came here on my second to last day in California and I was really fond of this place. I'm not a burger eater but my lovely host sure enjoyed his. I ordered steak fries and a salad and I truly loved it. What I really love about them was that the fries were fresh and not fried from overuse oil.  I still would say this is a joint for burger lovers and not veggie people but I would still come here just for the fries. ^^",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=180
Lauren M.,"Long Beach, CA",89,203,21,1.0,6/28/2009,"i dont know why i keep coming back here.  oh yeah, i know!  My granma likes to eat here and she pays for my meal every time.   It kinda sucks because I get to have quality time with my granma (aka kissing her butt so that when she dies I inherit $$$$$$$$$), but yet I haveta endure eating disgusting food with her.  For example, IHOP and HOMETOWN BUFFET. CRAP I'VE HAD HERE: The guacamole bacon burger and Whiskey River BBQ are ok and the most tolerable of all the foodz here. Chicken Caesar Salad Wrap, again, most tolerable but kinda bland. Bottomless Fries.  Good but after a while its like eating potato mush and ketchup. WORST OF ALL: The chicken fajitas!  Not only were my fajitas NOT sizzling when they were presented to me.....BUT THERE WAS NO TASTE! I thought I was eating a rubber chicken!  Was I eating a joke?!?  Apparently, so.  But I wasn't laughing because granma just threw away $12.00!  That $12.00 coulda been mine someday!!  DAMN!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=180
Bob H.,"Orange, CA",3,29,,2.0,6/23/2009,"I'd rather have fast food.  What does it say about a restaurant when french fries are the best part of your meal? The Chicken Parmagiano Pasta was very bland and the chicken breast was really salty. Burgers were average which is unacceptable when they are in $10 neighborhood. Another ripoff is that they charge extra to get ""bottomless"" drinks, around $4, which is about double the price of one drink. You can get an equally good premium burger & drink at In-N-Out, Carl's Jr., Fat Burger, etc. for half the price.  About the only favorable thing I have to report is that our server was very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=180

Jen M.,"Orange, CA",0,1,,2.0,9/5/2012,Ordered to-go there last night and it was horrible.  All the meals we ordered that had fries with them came with like 10 fries...if we had eaten in the restaurant it is bottomless fries so why not pack them in there for to-go orders?  One of our orders was a BBQ chicken salad (without the chicken for a vegetarian) but it had very little BBQ sauce on it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=220
Geraldine G.,"Anaheim, CA",2,10,,5.0,6/20/2012,"We like to go there for the delicious burgers! Love how I can order any burger and substitute the beef patty for a turkey or veggie patty. Service is beyond friendly, they come around your table often to make sure everything is going ok and if you need anything.

Kyle P.,"Orange, CA",32,20,3,2.0,1/24/2008,"I love red robin burgers. Try their onion ring sauce on your burgers and fries its really good. I have been here twice, I usually frequent the Tustin Marketplace Red Robin. You get bottomless steak fries with your burgers. The only problem with this place is that both times we have gone, they are ""out of fries."" Both times they tell us they are making them when we asked for a basket of fries, yet when our burgers come out they give us fries on the side of the burgers. The first time we finally got our fries AFTER they gave us the bill. The second time we had a group of 8 people and they gave us two baskets of fries after 10 minutes that were only half filled. The burgers were good, we just never got the ""bottomless"" fries that red robin is known for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=220
evan p.,"Allston, MA",7,69,43,4.0,3/23/2007,"Decent place.  $9 burgers are as good as IN-N-OUT but with higher quality meat.  Bottomless steak fries are plentiful, but not that good.  Atmosphere is decent, tons of cute girls there.  Good drink menu.  It's a casual sit down burger place, an it's not that bad.  I will go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=220
