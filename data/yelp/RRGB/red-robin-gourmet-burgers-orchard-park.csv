Peter R.,"Buffalo, NY",14,45,,5.0,8/30/2017,"We have been going here ever since they opened and have never been disappointed. Whether eating in or taking out the food is great, just as advertised and almost always perfectly prepared.  The few times we have had a problem, staff was exceptional when trying to make corrections. One time when I tried a new offering and found it lacking, I spoke with the manager who took the time to listen to my complaints and did not charge me due to my disappointment. When looking for burgers, there is no better place to be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orchard-park

Jenny C.,"Hamburg, NY",213,104,123,5.0,6/13/2016,"I went to this Resturant last night and had a good experience. We walked in and the foyer was crawling with people! We asked how long the wait for 2 would be and she said 20 minutes unless we wanted to sit at the bar or at one of the high tables at the bar. We decided on one of the high tables and skipped the wait, which we were happy about!  I had a peach iced tea, which I would not recommend. The tea was a brewed tea and it tasted very bland and unappealing.  Our waitress was also bar tending, but she was very very good. She God our food to us quick and was happy to work with us in each and every little thing.  I had the Mad Love burger, which is only there for a 'limited-time' according to their menu. It was some interesting flavors  and I really enjoyed it! I also had the garlic aoli to dip my fries it and it was delicious. The French fries are bottomless so if you are able to eat more, you are welcome to!  I have also been here previously with a large group of people and they were more than willing to work with us!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orchard-park
Linda H.,"Cheektowaga, NY",0,8,,1.0,11/5/2017,"This is one of the worst burger place I've ever been to.   Was very excited to try this restaurant and got nothing but disappointment. It start with the drinks. I order a Mojito and it didn't have any alcohol in it.   Server was never around so my husband had to go to the bar to get me something else. The food was cold, and our server was very unfriendly and seemed rushed. Her name was Summer. So if you go there and she is your server. Ask for someone else.

Jess L.,"Buffalo, NY",6,111,91,4.0,11/8/2016,"I don't really do chain restaurants but I was out this way and needed something quick to-go for lunch. I had the whiskey river chicken burger and subbed the fries for a salad. The salad was a good size and fresh, and there wasn't the typical $2 up-charge for replacing  deep fried goodness with a healthier option. The chicken was charred on the outside and juicy inside, which to me is perfect. Sauce was the right amount and tasty.

Hannah W.,"Buffalo, NY",19,54,26,4.0,6/24/2017,"My family and I have always loved red robin. The atmosphere, food, and service have always been great for us! They recently updated several things in their restaurant, keeping it new, and updated. The service was awesome, and it was also kind of busy when we were there, so I give them credit on that. I've tried several of their dishes however, my favorite is the whiskey river chicken wrap. It's a chicken wrap with BBQ sauce, tortilla chips, and some vegetables mixed in. You get your choice of regular fries, or sweet potato fries. Both are very good, and if you really like them, they will gladly give you a free refill of fries. Last, be sure to save room for dessert! They always have different specials going on! Right now they have the tower of Doh! Nuts, which is literally a tower of doughnuts, that comes with fudge and berry dipping sauce. It was amazing. I'd highly recommend red robin, especially if you have kids!:-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orchard-park

My waitress decided that she wasn't going to walk around the large table to deliver our meals, but was rather going to stand on one end and have us pass the meals down the table to their appropriate diner. What?!  No automatic drink refills, had to ask several times.  I had the avocado cobb salad and per usual, it was tasty enough. I think it used to come with some type of focaccia bread, but this seems to have disappeared lately.

Tom D.,"Silver Creek, NY",1248,1245,460,4.0,6/28/2014,"Ok - I know it isn't fine dining nor is it a mom and pop place, but for what it is - its is darn good at it.  This place was crazy with patrons and yet the food was being served quickly and ours was very good. I cannot believe they have bottomless root beer floats and bottomless sweet potato fries. However, if you have blood sugar issues, I'd suggest NOT having three root beer floats even if they are bottomless and adding the fries doesn't help with blood sugar either, but they were both amazing! I must comment though on the floor - though everything appeared clean - the floor felt like it was mopped with grease water as it was extremely slippery! It might also had something to do with the humidity, but whatever the case - is even made standing in the bathroom difficult - I won't go into detail there! Our server was great - made all the right recommendations, the kitchen was spot on getting the food ready in a very timely manner and the endless stuff was indeed endless as our server really didn't even wait for us to ask for more - she just kept bringing it until we said STOP! Pricing was decent, seating was nice, selection was huge and parking was very ample! We would surely return to this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orchard-park
Heather Anna W.,"Clifton Springs, NY",27,105,42,1.0,6/19/2017,"Father's day disaster. Waited a long time for a table of seven as we expected to. We were not upset about that. We were seated, given drinks and then became invisible for almost an hour. We had two children with us, one of which is only three years old and she was really hungry. We decided against appetizers because usually we have way too much food. I guess there should have been a warning that if we don't order an appetizer you will all be starving. So for 50 minutes there are managers walking around and our server is walking past us and never once did anyone come over and apologize or explain what was taking so long. It would have been really nice for someone to offer something on the house for the kids to munch on perhaps one of those small baskets of bottomless fries? Either way we got very upset and we are very patient people who have worked with the public so we give people a lot of leeway. We went up to the hostesses and asked to speak to the manager.  After about five minutes trying to find the manager or our server he comes back and says the manager is busy because there was a disaster in the kitchen. We said we would wait back at our table for her. Still our server never stopped by either. Before the manager had a chance to visit our table, the food had arrived. We heard the host talking to the manager and we heard her say to ignore it. We're not sure if that comment was about us but she did never stop over until we finally called her over to our table. We basically told that a dollars worth of free French fries for our hungry children and an apology or explanation would have sufficed. When my sister's food came out it was terrible and had been sitting under a warmer, which is even worse since we were waiting so long. She sent it back and it was cooked to perfection. My father and I ordered french dip sandwiches and the bread was disgusting. It was soft it was like a Subway cheddar bun. They have ciabatta in the house and that would be a more appropriate choice. The manager then said she was going to do something about the bill and when we got the check nothing was adjusted.  We had expected that they would at least remove the sandwich that had to be remade Because by the time she got her food she been waiting over an hour and 20 minutes. I got the name of the host and the hostess (Joe and Hayley) because they were amazing and very attentive and concerned about our situation. I told him that I was going to be contacting corporate and mentioning them by name, to their delight. We went to the bathroom and the manager must have gotten wind of that because then she offered to take $50 off our bill. We had driven an hour and a half to meet my father at Red Robin. I used to be a fan of them but I feel like every time I go there there's something like this but seriously it's just customer service. They could have saved themselves $50 and a bad reputation if they had just looked at us, apologized and offered a little something for the children.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orchard-park

Katie M.,"East Amherst, NY",75,81,43,5.0,2/26/2015,"I've been to Red Robin many times, and I can honestly say I've never had a bad experience. What I love about the chain is that they give you options. As a pescetarian, whenever people ask me to go out for burgers I automatically assume I'll be eating a salad that evening. Red Robin swaps out any meat patty for a veggie burger, for no charge, so you can get any burger they have and have it be vegetarian (watch out for the burgers with bacon though, you'll have to ask them to hold it). My point is you have just as many options here if you don't eat meat. I also love that they will swap out your fries for broccoli, which is also bottomless. Yesterday I tried a lettuce wrapped Banzai burger (my favorite) instead of getting the bun. It was equally as delicious, and also gluten free for those who avoid wheat. I would definitely get that again! Also, our server was fantastic! She was very attentive, but not overly so, and she was super friendly. The service was fast, and even though we had a 15 minute wait for a table on a Wednesday, we were served pretty quickly. Overall, a great experience. Another thing, if you come to Red Robin often, ask to sign up for the Red Robin rewards program. Every 10 meals you purchase, one of them is free. You also get a free meal for the month of your birthday! You'll also get perks every once in a while, like free appetizers and things like that. I highly recommend signing up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orchard-park

Gary M.,"Alden, NY",0,11,2,1.0,9/20/2015,Service was good. The burger on the menu did not match the burger I received. Order black peppered bacon and received bacon that was shaken with ground pepper. When you pay $14 for a burger you expect quality ingredients  . Clearly not peppered bacon like the photo. Not worth the money. Ordered a beer float with blue moon. Drink was very good but they show a photo of the drink in a 22 oz blue moon glass and bring you a 16 oz glass. When asked the server said all of the other glasses have been broken and they didn't have any..also there was a entertainment fee hat we felt were trap to pay. They have those little tabletop touch screens on every table. Be careful with these they charge you to play the games. You have the option of canceling but it's very quick and a one time offer.

Carley M.,"Buffalo, NY",130,141,66,1.0,2/15/2013,"I've thought about this review all night.   When we finished eating, my dinner partner mentioned that he couldn't wait to read my review - we had, after all, just experienced the best waiter service that we've gotten in over two weeks - and from a chain restaurant.   And then my dinner partner looks over toward the kitchen and then turns to me and says ""Don't ever order the onion ring tower thing from here.""  This from a man who has worked in chain restaurant kitchens and who is not squeamish about ""exacting"" (read: no foreign objects)  food standards like me.   What's wrong with the onion rings?????  Apparently, the onion ring tower is TALLER than the kitchen service window area they have, so when the kitchen pushes the orders through, the onion ring towers brush and bang and scrape against the heating lamps that hang from the ceiling.  Collecting dust.  Probably never wiped off.  Probably sneezed on.  Soon to be on your plate. I initially wanted to say something to the manager - surely they didn't know this was being done???  My dinner partner told me not to bother.  Of course the manager knows about it.  They know what's on the menu and how big the kitchen delivery area is.  There probably isn't another good way to pass the food out.  What's a little bit of grime in your food anyway?   He also didn't want to risk causing a scene. I still feel like I should tell the manager.  Give them the benefit of the doubt and an opportunity to correct it. If they let this slide (out in the open where guests can easily see it because there are tables all along the kitchen line), what exactly ARE their standards for in the back, where we can't see, where they make the rest of the food???

Bethany M.,"Buffalo, NY",157,370,109,5.0,5/24/2012,"5 stars based on service and their willingness to specialize your order alone!! This is one of the superior chain restaurants in Buffalo and one of the very, VERY few I will happily eat in. The food is good - predictable, designable, and the website has an awesome interactive nutrition calculator which will pretty much allow you to determine the nutrition of anything you can make up from the food in the kitchen. Admittedly, I can't comment on the burgers - I've only ever ordered the chicken breast ""burgers"" but I have never been disappointed. The one time something did go wrong, they made up for it PLUS some, and I was so pleased about it. I almost *want* something to go wrong next time! (ALMOST) They're really flexible about the sides, too. Don't assume you have to get fries - you can have veggies, salad, or - since they stopped offering cantaloupe for health reasons - they let me get apple slices.  They have a new program that rewards regulars and have started implementing happy hour specials and a few other things. We love the ""kick starters"" apps that let you choose small portions of apps. We never used to order any, even if we wanted them, because they're always designed and priced for at least 4 people. Now you can order a 2-person portioned app and not be full (or have eaten 1200 calories) by the time your dinner gets there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orchard-park?start=20

Bradford P.,"Bradford, PA",0,14,,4.0,3/3/2016,"Although I try not to frequent chain restaurants too much, this is one that tops my list when in the mood for this type of food.  Excellent burgers which is what I usually stick to.  Tried a chicken sandwich once but felt like sending it back after the first bite.  I'm sure there are some other things on the menu that are good but in my opinion, the burgers are what will bring me back.  I will say that as good as it is, it's too much - unless I automatically save half to take home, I always leave feeling stuffed and bloated.  It's hard to not want to finish the whole burger though!  Service at this location is usually good, have had one or two experiences with servers that were a little slow to check back on us and also exhibited the lazy quality I saw referred to in other reviews.  I'm not a fan of doing their work for them by passing food down the table unless there is clearly no other way for them to do it.  The food is, at times, a little slow getting to the table and while they have always been busy when I've been there - I think they are always that busy during peak lunch and dinner hours so that speaks more to either a staffing problem in the kitchen or a lack of efficiency in the kitchen process.  It's great to have adequate seating but if you are going to seat so many, you need to step up your game and make sure service, and food getting to the table do not suffer because of it.  That being said, we will keep going back - knowing we shouldn't be on a super tight lunch or dinner schedule!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orchard-park?start=20

BuffaloChicken C.,"Hamburg, NY",26,20,3,5.0,1/6/2010,"Awesome service,good food. The reason I'm writing this review is I was in there 01/06/2010. Now the mascot Red is only there on Tue & Thurs. I asked if red was there not knowing the dates Red was there. The Awesome part is Red came out just for me! Now that is great service!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orchard-park?start=40
Cookie X.,"Buffalo, NY",5,101,18,3.0,3/19/2009,"There is an IHop in the same plaza and a cold stone creamery. Red Robin is okay for what it is.  The all you can eat fries gets people in the door but once you are there you realize the fries are big and ""doughy.""  Not the kind you can eat many of.  I ordered a veggie burger which was okay, nothing special and overpriced.  I guess I was just happy they had something I wanted.  We also ordered a smoothie which I actually thought was delicious.  Service was very good and the atmosphere is your applebee's-ruby tuesday's type.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orchard-park?start=40
