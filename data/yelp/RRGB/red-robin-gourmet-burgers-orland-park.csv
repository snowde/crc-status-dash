Rachel B.,"Tampa, FL",47,153,600,2.0,1/3/2018,"Wow. Flat out - the other reviews were right! Quite possibly the worst Red Robin I've been to. Maybe even one of the worst restaurants I've been to, as well.  For starters, let's agree most adults go here for the kids. Am I right? Kids love this place. Well, even ours were disappointed. 4 kids, 3 adults visit for dinner. Walk in, no one else is in the lobby, we see empty (albeit dirty tables everywhere), and are quoted 20 minutes. (Rudely, I might add. 2 people and it took some back and forth from them to come to this 20 Minute guesstimation). Anyway, it took closer to 6 minutes for our table. A smaller group came in after us and did get a table quickly.  Our server brusquely introduced herself and I kid you not, robotically took orders. No inflection. No banter. It was ""You?"" ""Thank you."" ""You?@ ""Thank you."" So we wait. Too long. We hear servers and cooks yelling at each other. Apparently, according to one server, you practically have to kill someone to get garlic fries in the window. Pretty sure I hear an f-bomb, as well, which is always awesome in a family restaurant with an open kitchen.  Then the orders come out. Well, kinda. Kids meal with a wrong side item, adult meal with the wrong side item, side of ranch missing, my meal COMPLETELY MISSING. Had to remind the server what it was. Pretty sure it was never entered, as I then had to wait another 10 minutes for the Southern Charm burger and cole slaw. (Which, not so charming after all. Although cooked to temp, it was oozing in too much bbq sauce and the toppings weren't even crunchy at that point. So much sauce, even the presentation was lacking and t came out with sauce on the top of the bun! Like someone's hand had gotten in it!) My cole slaw tasted good, but was presented oddly. It looked like it was pre-scooped into the dish and was kinda wilty and flat on top.  Also at our table was a teriyaki Chicken Sandwich, on lettuce instead of a bun, that fell apart it was so saucy.   One of the adults had a plain burger with fruit salad. It was the weirdest fruit salad ever. Missing strawberries (so not really a freckled salad after all) and oozing in juice. Soaked. Even the apples had turned a kinda pinkish juicy color. Our server did bring more servings of bottomless fries and Mac and cheese for the kids. Of the 3 refills, one of the bowls of Mac was cold. Flat out, when the child complained and for some reason I didn't take her word for it (crazy I didn't assume t was wrong, right?), I actually stuck my finger in the bowl. Cold. Awesome. Told the server, no ""I'm sorry"" or ""Wow, let me fix that for you."" She literally looked at us and said ""Ok."" Trust me, we laughed about this in disbelief the minute she walked away. One of the kids also ordered a second helping of bottomless salad. Wound up getting an adult side salad with tomatoes on it. Of all places, Red Robin, who specializes in reeling in the kids, should know tomatoes is a no-no.  Soon after this, we heard another patron yelling at the manager. Something about waiting too long for a table and looking around and it was empty. Honestly, one of us should have walked over to her and told her to just go somewhere else - save her sanity and her money.  Our server did bring out complimentary birthday sundaes to all the kids as an apology. Gotta say, would have preferred a comped check instead of that.  I'm giving this location 2 Stars out of 5 simply because I reserve 1 Star for places that make me sick or have health violations. Save for the fact that there was no food poisoning involved, this would have been a 1. Seriously. That. Bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orland-park
DeOnna B.,"Glenwood, IL",60,6,8,1.0,7/16/2017,"07/14/2017 I placed my order online with specific instructions including ""extra fries"".  Unfortunately, due to a past experience I now check my order before I leave the restaurant.  Needless to say I was disappointed in the quality of food.  The bun was not ""grilled"", the sauce on both burgers were a thin spread, the Black & Bleu Burger did not grilled onions nor the mushroom as expressed in the description, and the other did not include the extra fries...If the intent was to give me extra fries I wold hate to see how many fries I would have received if I did not ask!  I reminded the cashier Hannah that my order specifically indicated extra fries for both orders and that the burgers looked ""Sorry"".  Without much of a response, Hannah informed me that she would place an additional order for extra fries.... It is unexceptable that whomever packed my order actually deemed it of quality/acceptable.  Although my order is ""To-Go"" I do not want to make it home only to be disappointed that a restaurant located in my own neighborhood serves such poor quality of food!  Orland Park is known as the ""To-Go"" neighborhood for many people in the surrounding neighborhoods.  To know that Red Robin Orland Park is respresenting Orland Park in such a manner is shameful.  It's unfortunate that I no longer want to return to the Orland Park location and now have to seek another ""Gourmet"" burger restaurant in my own area.   Please improve your standards...or re-locate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orland-park

Mo J.,"Tinley Park, IL",3,54,9,1.0,11/14/2017,Honestly this experience has been terrible. We waited over 1 hour for our meals to come to the table and when it finally arrived it was cold. Burgers were very dry fries were extra soggy cold and waitress was know where to be found. By far the worst experience I have ever encountered in any restaurant chain. It was what it seemed a very slow night which would give no reason for this type of service. I wish my $95 donation goes towards employee training. I recommend portillos of five guys for a much better tasting fresh burger.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orland-park
Austin T.,"Frankfort, IL",14,3,,5.0,12/6/2017,"This is probably my favorite restaurant in the last 3 months of my life, second to only a few others. It has a phenomenal staff who consider me one of their 'own'. The fact that I can walk in with only a small amount on my debit card yet walk out feeing full, satisfied, and content with my carton of refilled fries (bottomless refills!) is of utmost importance to me. It is one of a kind and I TOTALLY dig it. Thanks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orland-park
Marcus G.,"Chicago, IL",298,114,316,2.0,3/16/2017,"This is the first Red Robin I've been to, and it wasn't the greatest experience. The saying is, if the place is crowded and the lines are long it must be because the place is great. Ehh, not so much here. It's because the service is sloooow and good luck on getting your server back after you received your menu. I almost wanted to get up and leave in between that time because they take so long. This is probably why the parking is packed and the lines are long! People are waiting for the menu. When we finally ordered the food I assumed it'll be a long wait but it was pretty average time. BUT, when do get your food, try to think of EVERYTHING you need and ask them for it. Even for the bottomless fries you haven't dived into yet. If ""your thing"" is bottomless fries then it should truly feel that way. It's almost like you're bothering them for asking when that is what I paid for. The same with dipping sauces; it's like pulling teeth to get this simple stuff. I've gone to another location and it was almost the same experience but not as bad. I love the food and the concept but the service could potentially push me away from this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orland-park
Amanda W.,"Chicago, IL",1,6,,1.0,11/18/2017,I am beyond furious right now. I just left Red Robin without even ordering! We got seated and waited... and waited... and waited. No one came to acknowledge our existence. The family in the booth next to us that got seated after us already ordered their drinks and received them and then started to order their food. Before we were even acknowledged. So we left and now I'm hungry and pissed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orland-park

Mike S.,"Lockport, IL",8,111,204,3.0,6/27/2017,Visited this Red Robin today for a late lunch about 1:30 pm. There were lots of little kids in there as usual screaming and yelling. But that's OK because if you do not have little kids you can sit in the bar area and it's a bit more quite in there. Service was good and food was ok. Son said his bacon cheeseburger was not that great. I did taste a fry and it was not hot. Wife and I  ordered Salads with the Whiskey BBQ chicken and avocado. My chicken was OK but wife did not like it. She ate a small portion and was just going to leave the rest but I had her wrap it so that I could try it later. No desert today. Food here use to be much better a couple years ago.

Judy Y.,"Orland Park, IL",15,4,,1.0,5/6/2017,Terrible service/staff. Waitress ignored us. Our food was serviceable. The worst thing was the busboy adjusting his socks and picking his feet in the dining room and then touched the glasses. What a health hazard.

However, I can tell you this is a pretty good restaurant. I went on a Friday afternoon with my boyfriend and it was pretty empty, there were only us and one other customer. The waitresses didn't have much to do and sat around talking with the bartender, but our waitress was nice enough. The busboys were really nice though. They asked us about our new year and how our meal was. Typically, you don't have bus boys who are so friendly.  The burgers were pretty good. They have some unique combinations, but the classic looks pretty good too. I had the Whisky River BBQ burger. It was big and I ended up only eating half, but I could've eaten the whole thing. My boyfriend got the Southern Charm Burger and, unfortunately, he won the plate off and he got the better entrée. We also got bottomless fries with our food, which we didn't take advantage of since there was so much food, but nice to have.  Overall, this is a solid burger joint and I'd go again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orland-park

That is no longer the case, I will tell the story of our experience this afternoon.  We came to Red Robin for some lunch with friends, upon entering we weren't greeted properly (No 'hello' or welcome to 'Red Robin'.) the hostess just pointed us to a table without a smile and we sat down. About five minutes later we finally saw our waitress, we ordered drinks and after the drinks were brought to the table we noticed two of them were only half full!  So, we order and appetizer and there are no sauces to be found on the appetizer, so I flag over the girl that brought us the appetizer and ask for sauce. She never comes back, fifteen minutes later I see our waitress again and ask her for the sauce that we asked for. . . she finally brings it and drops it on the table just to run off again when we all needed refills.  So we all got our entrees, the food was cold and mediocre at best.  My bun was stale and my sandwich was tasteless. . . the fries were ice cold.  NONE of us were satisfied and I highly doubt any of us will come back. Edit: 5/7/16 This establishment has really improved since I wrote the above negative review some years back, the past few times I've been there my food has been fresh and the service has been wonderful.

It was snowing and cold, so I dropped my son off so that he could grab a table. He walked in and was seated right away. Parked, walked in and my drink was already on the table. Ordered with in a few minutes and food was served quickly. Fries were hot. Burgers were cooked the way we like (med/rare, the location in The Woodlands, TX refuses to cook med/rare).

V K.,"Chicago, IL",7,9,,1.0,9/5/2016,"So just to get to the point, this place is getting worst each time I return. The last time I went about 6 weeks ago, I noticed that they pretty much sit families with kids on the south side of the restaurant away from the bar. So if you get seated on that side you have to deal with you know the typical.   On the bar side there's only about 4 booths and the rest of the tables are small with uncomfortable bar like stools whereas your feet are dangling throughout your meal. During that same visit,  I had to request clean silverware from my waitress because they were noticeably unclean. On my next visit on Saturday Sept. 3, the waitress placed my silverware on the table and the person I was with noticed that a food particle fell off the silverware onto the table. Upon inspection of the silverware we noticed that one of the forks was covered in ketchup  and appeared as if it had been dipped directly into the bottle.  Then we noticed that many particles were floating in one glass of water and the other had food particles stuck on the inside of the glass. Perfect way to get food poisoning or something else.  Help yourself!!    I don't believe in the 3 second rule.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orland-park?start=80

Plus, they have ""Never Ending Fries"" (def.: they are ""Never Ending"" only if you ask for more.  They won't refill your baskets like they do your soft drinks) So we came with a party of 14.  The wait was pretty short for that amount of people. But we sat down and ordered the cheese sticks (which are great).  One other person ordered the pretzel bites, which were really good too. For our entree, I ordered the Oktoberfest Burger (ham, Swiss cheese, sauteed onions, on a pretzel bun)...The Girl got a Spicy Chicken sandwich plain The food came out and I devoured it like a vacuum sucks dirt.  Probably because I had eaten NO MEAT for that entire week...and I was feeling less than a man. My friend had ordered an Oktoberfest burger as well, though he wanted it with no onion.  One thing that I have noticed in the past about this particular Red Robin is that if you order an item, and change it in any way...they usually fudge it up ...and they did.  First it was brought out with the onion...then without the ham, which negated the whole specialty burger idea.  He was upset...but I was fine! :-) Like my last review for Cracker Barrel, they also did they whole Birthday Song and desert deal as well...it was fantastic! At the end, our waiter seemed to forget a few of the bills.  Not mine!  We separated ours from the rest of the group (tip coming up) It was a good time.  The atmosphere is great, but I've had a better burger and fries at Five Guys.  Still a nice place to go, and OH BY THE WAY, their sweet potato fries are really good! ...and A LOT BETTER than that Purple Onion garbage dump!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orland-park?start=80

Rick B.,"Orland Park, IL",41,692,383,2.0,4/21/2016,"Too bad but this place just keeps tripping over its own feet. Went for a burger and a beer last night and had the exact same experience we've had every time...just so-so food and service. The burgers are ok, but nothing special (Five Guys are better); service is where I think they make their money because they never seem to have enough wait staff - maybe they will learn they cannot save their way into prosperity - service was slow and spotty especially with the fries (see below); on the good side they have a nice selection of beer with many on draft...so this is their bright spot. Now the fries. The schtik of Red Robin is (1) Gourmet burgers (which means they can put nearly anything you want on a fair burger for $10 and up) and (2) bottomless or endless French fries (not even close). For the second time when we were there the bottomless fries are only in name. You get fries with your burger and are supposed to get as many more as you want...but you won't see anyone come by and ask if you want more until you are on your last bite of hamburger. You'd think they live and die off French fry sales. Why couldn't they just have one of the wait staff come around to the tables with a big basket of fries topping off everyone who had fries? Why do they wait so long to come ask? And when you do ask you wait another ten minutes for them to come out...by the time they do you are sorry you asked. Really...just have a person cruising the dining room with fries to top everyone off...Quit waiting for people to beg for more. So their schtik is lost on me...loses me as a customer too.  In all fairness, the manager did make the rounds of the room also...and also did so as we were finished. We saw our waitress maybe three times...took the order (after we cooled our heels for awhile)...checked in right after (hadn't even taken a bite yet)...and told us how to check ourselves out. We were never offered any dessert...never offered another beer...and were only offered more fries as they were ready to clean the table off...nothing. To add to the lack of staffing, they now have machines on each table so you can check yourself out...swiping your card and printing out your own receipt.

Jaya M.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,1,1.0,12/29/2016,"On Monday, December26th, my friends, my son and I visited your restaurant. This was to be my first time at the restaurant and I was admittedly very excited. I have tried to visit multiple times but the lines were too long. On this day, I was told that the wait time would be approximately 25 minutes. And while this was not idea, I was willing to wait because I was with a friend who generally rants and raves about this restaurant. After 40 minutes after giving our names, I was told that we would be next. Finally after almost 50 minutes we were seated. This was a frustrating experience but I understand that the wait time generally depends on the leisure of the patrons. After being seated, we were greeted by a pleasant waiter who promptly took our order. We ordered several blue moons that took almost 15 minutes to come. I was then told that if I wanted an orange in it, it would take at least another 10 so we agreed to drink the drink with out its signature garnish. After waiting 20 more minutes, our waiter told us that the kitchen had been experiencing some problems all day and the ticket time was at least 45 minutes. We asked to speak to the manager 3 times before he came to our table to talk to us. When we finally got our food at least 50 minutes after being seated, it was ice cold. I was floored and very angry because at this time, we had waited almost 2 hours for food that was freezing cold. I should have known this would be an issue because multiple patrons around us were complaining and sending food back to the kitchen. The lady across from me sent he burger back and it did not return for at least 20 minutes. I was not prepared to experience the same torture on my empty stomach, plus my 4 year old was completely famished and starting to wine in anguish. We ended up leaving the restaurant with out eating anything and wasting 2 hours on a perfectly good day in a restaurant that was obviously mismanaged, understaffed and dishonest. In the future, it would be more appropriate to 1). Give a correct wait time so that patrons can make an educated decision about how long they want to wait, 2) Let people know upfront that there are issues in the kitchen and that the ticket time is exceeding 45 minutes 3) Better attend to your guests by at least providing the necessary garnishes for their drinks.

Rich B.,"Chicago, IL",0,16,,1.0,6/22/2016,"I am giving them one stars,but I would rather give them no stars, not for the food, not for the service, but the condition of the restaurant itself is in. If you are in anyway handicapped, read on. If you have trouble walking, read on. If you just walk, read on. Most of the restaurant's floors are a tiled marble or slate or some kind of stone whether man made or natural. It is red and it is very slippery. I do not know if it is from the grease that is normally associated with restaurants or because of the air conditioning that there was condensation on the floor, or more likely, a combination of both. I have to use a cane to help me walk,  I am in the middle of getting both my knees replaced. The cane would not hold its gripe on the floor and kept sliding. I had to walk and hold onto the chairs, unoccupied tables, anything to stabilize me.  I nearly fell. Another patron, a woman, said that she also almost slipped if she hadn't gripped the booth divider. She complained but nothing was done. They had one warning sign out, the ones that you use for a wet floor, that was you only warning. A mop and some grease cutting detergent is not going to clean it. I worked in the restaurant industry for 5 years and have had to clean floors using a scrubbing machines to get the grease off. I would suggest that they have their floors cleaned regularly by an outside company or by a scrubber. One of these days someone is going to fall and they are going to have a lawsuit on their hands.  As for the food I would rate that 3 stars. The crab burger is good considering that it is not fresh like on the east or west coasts. We also had the fish and chips and chicken platter.

And my thinking re: the bottomless fries, is that they're not very good and so that's why they continue to give them away for free.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orland-park?start=140
Megan L.,"Chicago, IL",4,2,,3.0,1/20/2009,"I battled the bone chilling, school canceling cold to try out the new Red Robin.  The building has been up for awhile andits been teasing and taunting me as I drive by.  Needless to say, I had been awaiting its opening.  I wasn't the only one undefeated by the weather and ready to score a burger.  The restaurant was packed with a diverse crowd....students off from school, mom's and their kids, and workers out for lunch.  I ordered a turkey burger....it was pretty good.....juicy and boldly flavored with pepper.  The chipotle mayo that came with it had a nice little kick, but became a little much by the end of the burger.  The condiments were fresh and the staff was friendly.  I just wish the price just wasn't so high.  For a cheaper, equally or better tasting burger I would head to Blackies.....which is opening soon in Tinley Park or even Fuddruckers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orland-park?start=140

Steven M.,"Mokena, IL",1162,1210,14,2.0,8/1/2009,"This is a great place for lunch. Just look out for the kids at dinner. I got right in at 6 on a Friday night. Had the server on top of us asking for our drink order right away. Had the manager ask how everything was. And that's were the service fell off the cliff. We were right next to the bar and it took 10 minutes for the drinks. So we ordered the food. The banzai burger is my favorite. We both polished off our fries right away. Considering there were only about 8 in each of our baskets. But that's what unlimited fries are all about. I got a refill on my drink and my basket was as empty as her head because I had the burger in my hand. After we finished our food. We waited and finally our fries came. They would have been great about 5 minutes ago when I saw a guy with an arm load flinging them at every table but ours. She didn't even put the basket down and she spun in a circle to give us the check and told us to have a good night. Oh, are we leaving? Did she even ask if we wanted anything else? So I paid the check and she swipes the basket as we are still eating. WTF! Fine we will leave and not bother your ass again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orland-park?start=140

Danelle B.,"Orland Park, IL",2,14,,4.0,1/19/2009,"This Red Robin just opened last week.  Usually a restaurant really struggles with the quality of food and service during the first few weeks they are open,  NOT THIS RED ROBIN though.  We had to wait an hour for a table, which was fine but once we sat down it was great.  Right away the hostess apologized to us for the wait when he sat us at our table.  Then our waitress was wonderful, the food came out quickly, and even the manager visited our table twice to make sure everything was going ok.  I had the mushroom burger and it was outstanding.  The fries are OK, as they seemed overseasoned.  I'd rather have them plain and have the option to put the seasoning on myself (as it's on the table).  My daughter (10 years) ordered a burger off the adult menu and that was a big mistake as she could only eat about 1/2 of it.  She also ordered a shake that was great!!  We will absolutely go back as the burgers were very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orland-park?start=140

Laura K.,"Plainfield, IL",11,4,,1.0,5/4/2015,"Was in this restaurant on May 3rd 2015. Our visit began with a short 20 minute wait. Meanwhile we notice there were many tables waiting to be bussed, garbage debris on the floor, and the wait staff appeared to be stressed and chaotic. We were seated at a sticky table that was set in the main aisle and uncomfortably close to other tables.  In fact the back of our chairs were touching those of other patrons behind us.  Kyle our servicer,  was extrordinarily slow, and forgetful. We waited 15 before he took our drink order,  another 10 for water and maybe 10 more minutes for him to return to take our food order.  After waiting on our order 2 of the plates came to us which was not what was ordered.  The rest of the food and fries were cold. To get drinks refills was impossible,  certainly not worth the price especially since the cost of several were 4.95. I would have expected many refills - we were lucky to get 1 refill after the initial cup arrived. To get more fries seemed to be feat in itself.   Although it was busy and Kyle apologized for the slowness blaming it on the fact they were busy earlier,  he did nothing to improve our experience by speeding up his current service since the place had already begun to empty out after our drinks were delivered. We had to wait on napkins, forks and knives,  and by the time our second round of fries were delivered we were frustrated and swore to never return to this location again!  I'm sure Kyle works hard and waiting isn't an easy job but people tend to forget that a tip is NOT mandatory, as T.I.P. 's actual meaning is - To Insure Promptness. Kyle received a tip that reflected his service at our table - Pathetic!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orland-park?start=60

I had the whiskey BBQ chicken sandwich that was pretty great and my husband had the burger version was also quite good. Service was efficient but we did have to keep asking for fries, almost 5 times, because the servings they bring out are so small. Drinks are also extremely overpriced. A Coke for 2.79? That's a little nuts. They have also adapted to iPads for menus and payment system which is pretty efficient.

Jim P.,"Clearwater, FL",22,16,,1.0,4/25/2016,"If you ever eat in the bar area-  you will find that the bartender is made to wait on tables, wait on people at the bar, make shakes, make drinks, and go to the kitchen to get waters.   Thus- you will not get good service, as the poor bartender is given way too many duties to perform.  I witnessed the bartender doing everything, while other employees and managers were standing around doing nothing and talking.   How about helping her out?   If you eat in the main dining room, it's like Chuck E. Cheese in there............if you eat in the bar area, you will get poor service.   I saw people waiting for their check forever, got disgusted and just walked out.  Where is the manager??  We have talked to the manager twice in person about this- with no help or changes- we have thus removed Red Robin from our list of places to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orland-park?start=60

Dan H.,"New Lenox, IL",14,19,14,2.0,2/19/2014,"I dont come to Red Robbin very often but when I do it is always enjoyable... Until now. Let me take you for a ride down this dark visit. Let's start off with this. Normally in my previous visits we got frys right off the bat and normally got  two or three new baskets before the food arrived. Not this time. We didn't get a single order of frys until our food arrived. Now just step back and think about that. That's like going to Olive Garden and them not giving you bread sticks until your food arrives. I ordered the rib tips & Mac and cheese. A few visits ago their Mac and cheese was great so I figured I would try it again. This proved to be a terrible choice. The cheese on top was melted but the middle was still cold once the cheese was removed. No biggie, things happen. They replaced the Mac and cheese. Now for the rib tips. They were honestly 95% bone and 5% meat. I couldn't get any meat off of them. Overall: I would come back, just never order the riblets & Mac and cheese again. Also, things happen. Looking forward to possibly hearing from corporate about this. Not because I want something free, just to give them feedback about the quality of what I ordered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orland-park?start=60

The Garlic Fries were pretty good except when you get a chunk of garlic on your fry, gah. My Mother-In-Law and I shared a mushroom burger, it was flavorful, didn't expect that.

Colleen B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",129,252,31,4.0,1/7/2014,"It was a snowy and miserable day for driving. But we had to make our weekly trip to Trader Joe's or we'd be ordering Chinese food and pizza all week.  As we made our way there, we decided to get lunch at Red Robin. This was my first time at Red Robin and my boyfriend only recalled trying it once, a very long long time ago. He remembered ordered food at a counter and sitting down. Not a place with full waiter service. We were both surprised that it was a full out restaurant. But sat down anyways and ordered some burgers. Both of us wanted a cheaper place but neither regretted this choice. The burgers were great! I got the mushroom swiss burger (my favorite across the board) and my boyfriend got the chili chili burger. Because of the horrid weather, there were few other customers around so we got excellent service and a very friendly waitress.  The steak fries were wonderful. I enjoyed them and we even got a second order of them (since they were bottomless and free). Overall, we would definitely come back again when we have a taste for a burger. I liked the food far better than a Five Guys burger (which is way too greasy) in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orland-park?start=60
Michael P.,"Burbank, IL",82,53,212,3.0,7/12/2014,"Today I got the Collossus burger. Not a bad tasting burger. But, it is nothing like it looks in the pictures. There was maybe between a teaspoon to a tablespoon of brisket on it. The brisket really didn't add anything. If it wasn't there and it was just bbq sauce I wouldn't have noticed a difference. To me it seems Red Robin has taken a step back since they opened at this location. They give you your fries in these little metal rings. All that does is limit how much fries are in my basket and looks tacky. Come on I'm an adult give me more tgan just a few fries. And, today the food took a really long time.

We were seated fairly quickly and the waitress had taken our drink order, my boyfriend ordered a milkshake that had alcohol in it (I can't remember the name) but waitress could not figure out how old he was as he has an Indiana ID, so she had to go check with the manager which took a good 10 minutes. Finally my boyfriend got the okay and about another 15 minutes later we got our drinks from a bus boy, but he didn't give a straw for my soda and when we tried to flag someone down for a straw we were ignored. Eventually, the waitress finally came and took our order, in the meantime my mom was calling and wanted us to get home since it was getting late, but we still didn't have our food.

Only one weird thing which may be self explanatory, but still odd, the hostess greeted me with, ""Hi! How many & Are you both over 21?""
