Pop T.,"Oswego, IL",0,12,,5.0,10/25/2017,"We were a table of 7 with three kids/teens on a Wednesday evening. The waitress was outstanding and brought us fries to hold us over until the food came. There were endless refills on drinks without anyone asking. The menu has a large selection of choices and the food was tasty. A member of our party has a severe food allergy and forgot to mention it to the waitress and when the food came and she realized our error, she returned the food to the kitchen and put a new order in. No questions asked. The manager (Meredith) then came over to our table to let us know what they do to avoid cross contamination, etc. she was super friendly and showed the utmost concern for our table. Usually, this deadly allergy is dismissed by restaurants, and again, it was our fault for forgetting to mention it as we were all busy catching up with family, yet the staff went above and beyond to ensure our safety. Thanks again to the staff for making sure we were taken care of. This is the best service we have ever received at a local restaurant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oswego
Mike B.,"Naperville, IL",0,3,2,2.0,11/24/2017,Very dissatisfied...... We come here all the time and normally this is a fast Curtis and fun place to come. Today however I'm very dissatisfied. It is black Friday and they are not even as busy as they are on a Tuesday mid-day. The hostess took forever to seat the 3 top that was in front of us. My wife took our 2 year old to the rest room ( we all know how that can go) 5 minutes minimum. Still my wife was almost to the front of the restaurant looking for us thinking we would have been seated. We were going to be seated with no apologies for the long wait. Sat down  and our drink oder was taken quickly. However not entered for another long time because my kids could not turn on the game until till the drink order was entered. On top of it all my daughter's drink Cam and had food stuck on the inside of the glass. If it was not for lemonade we would not have even seen it. Food cam and was good but Service was way below the normal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oswego

Charles B.,"Warrenville, IL",0,1,,2.0,1/2/2018,"We occasionally go to Red Robin once every few months as my wife enjoys the Gluten Free menu.  We went to the restaurant in Oswego, IL mid afternoon on New Year's Day.  The staff was friendly but not overly helpful.  There were long periods where they were not around and  drinks were refilled slowly.  My wife's burger was well done despite ordering medium.  The bacon was left off of my burger.  The staff never offered to refill the bottomless fries or Cole slaw.  We didn't complain as the food was tasty as usual.  The problem came when after dinner, I went to the bathroom.  The bathroom was in shambles I assume from the night before.  None of the stalls had any toilet paper, there were feces stuck to the toilet rim, the floor and walls were discusting and the paper towel dispenser did not work.  I paid my bill and departed the restaurant to find a bathroom I could use.  I did tell the hostess about the bathroom and properly tipped the waiter as none of it was his doing.  I assume being New Year's Day, the staff was the ""B"" team at least that was my impression.  I will not go back to that restaurant ever, but I will go to another Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oswego
Bill N.,"Aurora, IL",282,156,223,4.0,1/16/2017,"I have to admit I have a love/like relationship with Red Robin. When they first opened in the area the idea of ""Gourmet Burgers"" was a novelty, and since then there have opened many restaurants offering Gourmet Burgers. Many of the other burger restaurants are more upscale and Red Robin has attempted to up its game too.  Originally Red Robin catered to families with children, their mascot a Red Robin of course and they even had an employee dress in a large Red Robin costume. Since then, they have attempted to appeal to both families with children and adults who just want to enjoy a good burger without exuberant (read screaming) children.  The bar area is now adult only, leaving the rest of the restaurant family friendly.  They have even remodeled the restaurant to give it a more ""almost"" upscale feel to it, losing many of Red Robin's signature trade marks (upside down Psycho Movie picture previously found in all restaurants) along with other familiar photographs and Red Robin related kitsch. It almost works too! What would help to make it work would be tables in the bar that don't wobble, and how about free WiFi like your competition provides! Aside from that, your servers and bartenders are excellent! A shoutout to Adam, who does double duty as both the bartender and server! Their Royalty program is very worthwhile to join. Not only do you get a free burger for your birthday, they send you numerous money saving offers throughout the year. BTW, their burgers are excellent too! For the longest time I've fallen into a rut ordering their Whiskey River Burger or their Big Tavern Burger. I've recently discovered the Southern Charm Burger and have a new favorite. How can I resist candied bacon strips, black angus patty, honey BBQ sauce, light brown sugar glaze, carmelized onions, salt and pepper, xtra sharp cheddar cheese, and mayo if you like. I don't know what Jimmy Buffett would say, but with an ice cold beer for me, it's a Cheeseburger in Paradise!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oswego

Misty S.,"Aurora, IL",852,953,14927,4.0,4/6/2016,"If you haven't heard, Red Robin has the latest craze in burgers - ramen burger!  Ok, maybe not the latest, but it's only been a thing for about year or so.  I didn't see any mention of it on their website (weird), but they have it!  Beginning 4/4/2016, they added Red Ramen Burger as a limited edition item for $12.  I didn't have high hopes for this and came with low expectations.  It's been a few years since I've been to RR and never to this location.   We came on a Wednesday night and there was no wait.  The hostess seated us in the bar area for dinner where they were playing the Hawks game on the big screen.  Service was cheerful and friendly.  They also have the computerize pads at each table so you can view the menu, add additional items to the order, call for service or pay with a credit card.  It also prints out a receipt or email it to you.  For a place this advanced, I'm surprise that they don't have a garbage can next to the bathroom door.  Where am I supposed to throw out my paper towel after I use it to open the door? They have many different kinds of burgers on the menu and the gourmet ones range from $10 - $15 and they come with bottomless steak fries. Red Ramen Burger $12 -  The burger was mad decent.  The ramen buns were deliciously crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  You'll have to eat it rather quickly or the bottom bun will get soggy, although it was good that way, too.  It was a little difficult to eat and messy, but I would do it again.  This burger was jammed packed with flavor and yummy grease.  It comes with chili-infused shredded cabbage, carrot, onion and deep fried jalapeno peppers. Berserker X Burger $11 - This was another limited edition burger that comes with Sriracha onion straws, sweet spicy pickles, cheddar on brioche bun.  It was good, nothing fancy. Not Your Father's Ginger Ale Beer $5.49 - This beer is recommended to be served over ice and it was pretty refreshing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oswego

Today I ordered coffee and asked the waitress to make a new pot if it wasn't fresh. She said sure! She bought me coffee but apologized they didn't have cream so she bought a glass of milk.

Angela P.,"Aurora, IL",440,1743,13,3.0,6/19/2016,"It happened.  It finally happened.  We were hungry, and I said, ""I just don't want tacos.  I'm getting a little tired of tacos.""  I'm sure it will only be another week before I change my mind, if even that, but we decided we wanted a burger and a cold beer. We didn't want to drive far, and I wasn't feeling really adventurous about trying something new, so we decided on Red Robin.  It's predictable, yes, but it's also reliable for good, affordable food.  It's a notch above fast food/fast casual, but a notch below the gourmet burger places.   Red Robin tries though.  There is a variety of burgers on the menu to choose from, and my favorites are the Whiskey River BBQ or the Peppercorn burger.  Both are packed with flavor.  Red Robin is also known for their bottomless French fries, and this location isn't as chintzy about the portions as others. The beer list is decent, but definitely in that notch below gourmet category.  You won't find many craft beers at Red Robin, more like Sam Adams or Blue Moon.   I never leave Red Robin with the feeling that I can't wait to come back, but I do leave Red Robin having had a satisfying meal at and affordable price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oswego
Chelsea E.,"Big Rock, IL",72,16,5,3.0,1/28/2017,"The food is good, not great, but good. I do think they're a little pricey. This was my second visit and it was much better than the first. The restaurant was clean and we were able to be seated right away in the bar area. Pub Mac and cheese is really good, if you want chicken it's an extra $3 - and not worth it. Boyfriend got a burger, said it was good, but he's one of those RR fans and raves about it. I think this place is simply average and a little pricey. It's essentially fast food in a sit down restaurant. Good but not great by any means. I left full and satisfied but it's not a place I'll be rushing back to. I have to add - they have the WORST guacamole I've ever had. Do NOT and I repeat do NOT get the guacamole burger!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oswego
Caroline M.,"Vancouver, WA",253,643,322,4.0,3/12/2016,"My husband and I came here for his birthday (his choice) and had a good time. Being the old people we are, we arrived for dinner at 5:30 pm on a Tuesday. No wait at all and quick service. They first tried seating us at the bar, but there was a booth and a high chair..um..no thanks. We went to a booth instead. Walking through the bar, there were several couples seated there, so I guess that's where you sit if you're a duo.  Our server was quick and friendly. I had some sort of southwestern salad which was delicious. Pretty large, should've been on a larger plate. The plate it arrived on was a little small in that once I started eating the salad, the lettuce started falling off the plate once it was being rearranged. Drinks were good, and they sang happy birthday. Overall, a good experience for a weeknight dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oswego

I mean, it tasted good and the chips were still hot coming out to the table, but the stand holding the items was architecturally displeasing to the eye.

It's Saturday!!!!! It's packed!!!!! Nothing should be old. I want to complain to the manager but I'm not even sure its worth it. I just know I won't be back. I asked for no pink in burger but just I'm not sure if my mind is playing tricks but my husband and I both think we see pink. The one positive is my son liked his chicken strips from kids menu.

We were presented a menu and selected the options we needed to avoid: eggs, milk, nuts. Ordered the plain turkey burger for my kiddo & after she bit into it, she said the sauce tasted funny. Of course it did! There's EGG in it. Terrible, terrible, terrible mistake! They tried to correct it -how do you do that after serving a known allergy to a customer who has done their due diligence and notified all responsible parties involved?! Will never go back to a Red Robin again. Avoid this place if you have food allergies/sensitivities! Sure, they may get it right once or even a few times with no history of mistakes for you personally, but 1 screw up is all it takes.

Since I like the Arctic Cod fish and Chips at another Red Robin I thought I'd give them a try at this location. I arrived shortly after 9:15 pm on a Friday and was immediately seated in the bar area. The tall Guinness I ordered was presented with a decent head and it was adequately chilled. My main order came out pretty quickly and was consistent with other franchise locations. The fish was a light golden brown shade and tasted correctly. The bottomless fries were hot and lightly salted.  The dill sauce was cold like it is supposed to be. While I was eating, I observed the dining room.  The area was clean and appropriately lit. The condiments at my location were adequately supplied. The noise level was a touch on the loud side, especially since I was seated under a speaker. The server checked on me several times to ensure any special needs or requests were addressed.

Amanda S.,"Saint Charles, IL",124,331,107,2.0,1/8/2012,"Times heals all wounds -anonymous So I haven't eaten at a Red Robin for approximately 8 years, which was the first..and last time I ate there.  At the time, I had a burger and fries at the Woodfield location.  While eating, I thought the food was average-- nothing special but I wasn't expecting my socks to be knocked off. Fast forward five hours and I was hurling in my (now ex) bf's yard as soon as I got out of the car.  That being said, I was truly afraid to patronize RR and did not do so until this past Friday night. This review is for the takeout only:  it was not good.  I do give them credit for somewhat complying with my picky order (Avo Cobb salad: no chicken or bacon, dbl egg, romaine lettuce) but that's about all. Avo Cobb salad:  modified as indicated above.  This salad was essentially all lettuce, with a sparse amount of avocado (think two small-ish slices of avocado), a sprinkling of diced tomatoes, a relatively generous portion of chopped egg, and olives...which were just weird.  They didn't really fit in the salad.  It would have been much better had more veggies been added, perhaps some cucumber and onion.  Also, they did not include the bread that was supposed to come with the salad or any salad dressing, which they had specifically asked me about over the phone.  That's inexcusable, regardless of whether or not you (the reader) think I'm a moron for ordering a salad at RR.  Anyhow, it was lettuce overload and almost had a weird chemically taste to it.  Grosssssssss.  So much for trying to eat relatively healthy. My bf ordered two items:  the Burning Love burger (w/ fries) and the Cheeseburger Con Queso.  Of course I didn't try either of these but I did ask him for a full review of said items. Burning Love burger:  not big enough (patty), not spicy enough, the breaded jalapeno slices were soggy, and he didn't even finish it (which is very surprising for this man).  Overall, fail. Cheeseburger Con Queso:  well, when he took it out of the bag, it basically looked like a half filled container of congealed cheese and partially digested beef.  He said the chunks of hamburger were too big, it wasn't flavorful and it was also room temp.  They do give you lots of multicolored chips though. His fries didn't even look appealing.  Usually I'll steal one (or several) fries from him but they just looked limp, undercooked, and tasteless so I didn't even bother.  He agreed and was underwhelmed, remarking ""well, this must be why we never go there""...see, it sucks. Overall, I would have to say I'll never return to a RR.  They don't have a decent healthy veg/pescatarian option, the food was not warm enough when we picked it up (we were on time and still stood at the bar waiting for them to put it together), and why the HELL would we spend $26.89 on this crap when we could get a better value through the Portillos drive thru a couple store fronts down? Fool me once, shame on you..fool me twice, shame on me.  I should have known better, and for that..I grant two stars to RR.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oswego?start=40

I've also had some decent tasting food there too.  But the food quality and the overall feeling I get about the place is a bit on the inconsistent side.  It's difficult for me to put my finger on however, their chief competitor down the street, Culver's is better by a long shot in my view. The service at RR can be spotty too.  I've had great servers, I've had annoying, pestering servers, and there have been times where I've wondered where mine went. The temperature setting at the Oswego restaurant needs to be looked into too.  Generally, I like it cool in the restaurant but it can be downright freezing in there at times!  It was so cold on one trip, I actually requested the manager warm the place up a bit.  Keep in mind, I'm a person who sleeps with a ceiling fan blowing on me in February. I waffled over caving and making their score 3 stars but in the end, I can't justify the maximum score for fast food (I won't give more than 3 stars for fast food or pizza) due to their inconsistency - and consistency is a critical trait to have if you want to stay alive in the restaurant business these days.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oswego?start=40
Ryan M.,"Oswego, IL",87,5,,5.0,4/24/2013,They have great food and great drinks.  One of a kind burgers and menu.  I had a waitress by the name of Justine and she was just great.  An extremely happy and helpful worker who makes the dining experience outstanding.

John S.,"Aurora, IL",126,438,5,3.0,1/19/2010,Always love going here for the bottomless fries and great burgers. If your into trying different burgers this is the place for you. While I will deeply miss the burger with the cheese stix on it I'm sure my heart will thank them for taking it off the menu. The service however at this location can very. Last night I swear our waiter had the hots for the girl at the table next to us because they got great service while we were pretty much ignored. My only other complaint is every time I go there I swear there are at least 4 or 5 birthdays and they scream that birthday song. Over all the food here is great although a but a bit on the pricey side for what you get.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oswego?start=40
Chris S.,"Elburn, IL",0,47,,3.0,12/28/2009,"I like Red Robin. They have a pretty good selection of burgers that hit the spot every once in a while. My problem with this location is that they have a faulty fire alarm that the restaurant cannot deactivate. I have seen fire trucks there multiple times and I have been eating there when the alarms went off. The manager explained the problem and probably would have comp'd our meal if we hadn't finished eating before the alarms started sounding.  Another time I ate there and the food was too hot. The restaurant was relatively empty, which probably explains why there was a problem. I ordered chili before my meal and it was too hot to eat even after I was done eating my burger. I like my food fresh, but this was taking it to a new level.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oswego?start=40
Sung Y.,"Bloomingdale, IL",15,107,174,4.0,2/1/2016,I have been to this Red Robin location a few times. It's clean and the interior is newer compared to other red robins. On this occasion we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and a couple of burgers. The chips that come with the dip must be made in house because they were nice and warm and not too salty. The black and blue burger was cooked well and had a good amount of flavor. The chibatta bread it was on was tasty. Sweet potato fries were good as well. Our server was prompt and courteous. The only complaint I had was the food took a little long to come out even though it wasn't very busy. Overall a good experience. Will return. Come check it out!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oswego?start=20
Jim C.,"Oswego, IL",0,27,21,1.0,7/3/2016,We live across the street and decided to try the restaurant when it first opened - had a couple burgers which seemed a little pricey and the waiter helped himself to more money by changing our bill and adding more of a tip for himself. When we discovered this on our credit card bill we went back and let the manager know of the theft - we received the balance back in cash but not as much as an apology or an offer to make things right. We haven't been back since. It was homecoming night and we wonder how many other young people were ripped off by that restaurant's waitstaff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oswego?start=20

E J.,"Yorkville, IL",0,7,,1.0,5/6/2016,"Red Robin...""back in the day"" was a place to go after work to meet with friends and have drinks and dinner. Weekends were a fun place to go after shopping during the day or dinner after  movie. Now it is filled with screaming kids running around unattended. It literally feels like you've stepped into a daycare center. It doesn't matter which Red Robin you go to. Being from Seattle, I wonder if it's just different here in the Midwest? Anyway- Service and food below par any more. As another person mentioned bottomless fries are suppose to be just that. Don't come out with 10 fries and disappear until you come back with my bill. The staff is more interested in their social time than the customers. I can't see ever going back unfortunately. Everything about Red Robin needs to be changed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oswego?start=20
Court W.,"Oswego, IL",39,48,119,4.0,8/5/2015,"Last night we decided to go to red robin with some family.  My husband and I have been here before and have always had a good experience.  We got the onion rings as an appetizer.  They were delicious and there were a good amount in the order for our group of 5 to share.   I got the a1 burger.  It was very yummy!!! My only complaint is that the onion straws are so thin that they get a big stringy and are hard to bite off. The fries are good, but since they are bottomless they only give you a few to start.  Realistically it's probably the perfect amount to partner with a burger but I always like a lot of fries!! Haha.

Lana C.,"Wheaton, IL",101,94,98,2.0,11/21/2015,"My boyfriend and I came here last Thursday because I had an extremely stressful week and I wanted to relax. It started off great but ended on quite the sour note. Short story waitress visited us three times prior to food, once food arrives we never saw her again. I am giving it two stars because we enjoyed our meals. 2.5 would be a better choice if I could make a half star review.  We got there and ordered drinks. I had the sangria, he had a Sprite. I also ordered a water. We ordered our food and we loved our meals. I had the buzz clucks and Mac and he had a burger. Once we got our food we never saw the waitress again, not even for our check or the bottomless fried that came with my boyfriends meal ... Which he wanted more of!!!! And never got!! I really wanted to order another drink. I stated to use the digital screen to try and figure out how to get more food. I pressed the button to ""call server"" and it was flashing red for a couple minutes, no one came. So I took matters into my own hands. Sure I could have taken the time to figure out how to use the stupid screen but I got so frustrated I decided since I could pay my bill digitally, and since it was the only thing I figure out how to do quickly ... I paid my check and we left. I would have probably ordered two more drinks and dessert if I wasn't so frustrated and didn't feel ignored. She didn't get a worthy tip at all because I was so pissed off... I had a crappy week, this didn't help.  Oddly enough as soon as I scanned my card to pay ... There she was asking us if we needed anything. Too late. Perhaps all of this technology is a really bad idea? I mean I can just pay my bill and not have to wait around for a server to hand me a piece of paper. And no one can try and fix a terrible experience since I am in complete control of when I pay my bill.  Oh I also love that auto tip feature because that was easily adjust down ... Probably would have given her zero tip but I don't think these stupid digital menus are entirely her fault. I hope your corporate office reads this.  The other table adjacent too us was visited 3 more times than we were (maybe they used the screen?) really wish this turned out differently.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oswego?start=20
Eric F.,"Oswego, IL",79,18,2,3.0,5/27/2015,"Quick update to my review. Red Robin saw my original review and they reached out to me to try to make it right. They sent me a gift card to come back in and give them another chance. We did go back in and this time ordered one of their tavern burgers and fries. This time the burger was cooked perfectly and the fries were hot and not cold. A much better experience than the last time.  The service was slow which was strange as it was memorial day and the restaurant was pretty slow. That said, the server was very nice and the food was enjoyable. I'm happy that the experience the second time around was far better than the first!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oswego?start=20

Vaughn J.,"Plainfield, IL",76,73,71,3.0,3/5/2016,"The BF and I came here for the Tavern Special today only to find out that the tavern menu doesn't include anything outside of beef in which I was informed by Justin it was because Red Robin doesn't have any other burgers which came in 2oz. I suppose I understand that, I also understand that you cannot accommodate everyone no matter what you offer. However, I would think if you offered a special it would include something that was not beef in which there are plenty of other options. I do believe a 2oz turkey burger could easily be made if nothing else. The food was pretty good and the server rocked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oswego?start=20
Zach Z.,"Oswego, IL",150,168,5,2.0,2/15/2015,"Red Robin, a very meh place that tries too hard and is a bit overpriced.   They have tons of crazy burgers, which is great done get me wrong, but we live in Chicago people...you can get great burgers everywhere AND they wont be so expensive.  I mean right down the street is Portillos who makes a wicked burger believe it or not, and culvers who also has a good burger.   I think of this place as a once a year type craving.  When I get the craving its all I can think about until we go there.  Then the minute we are done we are like...""why did we do that, that was stupid""   I have been to a few of these in a few different states and I will say they are consistent.  So if you have had experience with Red Robin and you like them, then this place will not disappoint.   For me though its a bit pricy for what you get and a bit too commercial (even though they are trying very hard to be retro) REEEEEEEED ROBIN....Meeeeeeeeeeh (Read that to the melody of their commercial, its funny right?)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oswego?start=20

We then placed our dinner order. Long story short...people who arrived after us were being served. Our server apologized ovet and over but it was never clear where the problem was. The most frustrating thing was that the ""manager"" a young man of about 22 kept walking around as if to be supervising. The t.v.s in the restaurant was showing a story of a young man who'd lost his leg to cancer. That was followed by nude modeling. Prime time family hour...no way. this place is a waste of money.
