Gary M.,"Tulsa, OK",112,382,1750,4.0,10/5/2017,"i had the burnin' love burger & it was long overdue. i visit red robin here & there, whether it's this location or not & i've always ran across this burger but would end up getting something else. this time around, i got it & it was definitely worth it. as for me, i enjoy spicy food, no matter what it is. it's stacked with fried jalapeno coins, salsa, pepper jack cheese & chipotle mayo. the salsa makes the burger, you definitely get it in every bite. they're not stingy with the jalapenos as well, it was stuffed as if they were pickles. one of the things that could be overlooked but shouldn't, it's not just a regular bun, it's  jalapeno-cornmeal kaiser roll. my goodness was it incredible. the service was good. i was greeted as soon as i walked in & when i went to the bar, the waitress/bartender was ready to take care of me. she checked on me quite often as well, which is a plus of course. outside of my selection, you can't go wrong with any type of burger they have to offer.  p.s. be sure to sign up for their rewards program. i paid $0 for my meal due to a birthday email.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-owasso
Daniel S.,"Keller, TX",1,33,16,2.0,5/16/2017,"The name is very miss leading!!!  The gourmet burgers is almost correct, they are ok, but now what is advertised!!  The Brews are lackluster at best!!!  Nothing special about any beer or spirits that they have here. I almost left, but was very hungry. I had the Pig out burger, but had to get two just so I wouldn't be hungry later. I am 6'4"" and weigh 190, so I am not a big eater, maybe that's why they offer endless fries.  I will never come to another Red Robin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-owasso
Rachel S.,"Tulsa, OK",27,148,36,4.0,11/29/2016,Ask for your fries early to get your never-ending-fries worth!!  Try their A1 Peppercorn burger (no mushrooms) and you can sub a turkey patty at no charge. Or go for something amazing and get the Bee's Knee's chicken and waffle sandwich. OMG- this thing is so delicious!! Angry Orchard honey sauce/glaze... Ask for the toppings on the side or don't get them as the extra veggies take away from the original flavor.  Get the pub fries and ask for Baja ranch- salsa ranch which is tasty! Ask for Baja ranch,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-owasso
Verónica D.,"Owasso, OK",108,36,514,4.0,3/26/2016,"I have visited Red Robins a couple of times now and this is the second time at this location in Owasso. The place is spacious and the people very friendly.  I love the burgers in Red Robin because they always cook the meat the way I order it and they have many options of burgers....I have tried a different one on every visit and I am always happy with the taste. They also have unlimited fries, broccoli, coleslaw or salad with your burger order. This place is perfect for family or big groups because it has a huge and varied menu. It has very delicious but high fat/calorie foods but it also have delicious more healthy options like using lettuce instead of bread with your burger and substituting the beef patty for chicken/turkey or vegan patty.  This time we decided to leave the bun out and opted for the lettuce wrap....Great idea. You can still feel all the flavors of the meat and the burger toppings and save you 200 calories. I ordered the Black and Bleu burger with mushrooms and bleu cheese. DELICIOUS....will order it again for sure. We also tried the Banzai Burger with pineapples and teriyaki sauce....also delicious.  I recommend that if you like the place and think that you will be visiting regularly you should get their rewards card. It gives you a free meal after buying 10 meals and it also gives you a free meal in your birthday! For those of you saving on calories like me avoid drinks (~500-800 cal) and dessert (~700 cal) and go with unlimited broccoli (~100 cal), then enjoy the burger of your choice with the lettuce wrap (~400-600 cals).....you will feel full at the end of the meal and there will be no left over....just the perfect portion for one! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-owasso
Bill D.,"Bridgeport, TX",17,10,18,1.0,8/19/2016,There was two other tables with customers in the entire place. Twelve minutes after we place X our order we were informed that they were out of vegetables for one of the burgers we ordered. TWELVE MINUTES! With only six people in the restaurant.  When finally served my buffalo chicken strips and onion rings were COLD!  Very disappointed in this Red Robin!  The manager did finally comp the food items on our ticket.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-owasso
Scott V.,"New York, NY",1,19,6,5.0,8/1/2017,"It's a bit of a story but it's worth telling and hopefully you feel it's worth reading.  My mother was just diagnosed with terminal cancer.  We want to do as much as we can with her in the brief time that we have left.  My son loves his grandmother very much and wanted to spend some time with just the two of them together so he put on a nice shirt, gathered some flowers and asked his grandmother out on a date.  My moms cancer has spread to her lungs so she can't talk long without talking so my son wrote out a list of things that we wanted to tell his grandmother about so that he would be doing most of the talking.  They were touching subjects like what he wanted to do after college, the things he wanted to see, the places he wanted to go, what type of girl he wants to marry, how many kids he wants to have - all the things that he wished he could share with her if she were still with us.  Since this would be an emotional dinner and my mom has some hearing loss I was suggesting quiet places like Mahogany, Flemmings, etc - nice places that I was willing to pay hundreds of dollars at to insure this was a memory that would last the rest of my mom and sons lives.  When my son insisted on Red Robin because that is where he and his grandmother like to go together then I was very concerned - I even tried to talk him out of it.  I'm glad he stuck to his choice. I called Red Robin very skeptical that I would be able to get anything in the way of help out of them.  I asked for the manager and waited.  Bridget introduced herself as the manager and I began telling her about ""the date"".  I asked for a quiet table, a reservation - knowing full well that the don't take them, some special help since my 16 year old son was in uncharted waters (driving with a permit, being on his first ""date"", paying the tab and taking care of his grandmother in her condition - she had her port for chemo put in that morning and was covered in bandages and bruises from the IVs) and a lot of understanding given the situation.  Bridget asked my sons name and promised she would take care of everything.  I really wanted to believe that but still had my reservations.  We were biting our nails and hoping for the best when we received a wonderful picture of my mom and son smiling from ear to ear over a table filled with food and glasses of strawberry lemonade.  We were so relieved.  Even more so when they made it back to the house and told us about their full experience.  I can't thank Bridget the manager, the amazingly attentive waitress that helped them all along the way - including her photography skills - and all the staff at Red Robin for making this such a special experience and a cherished memory.  Oh and they brought back some amazing leftovers - so kudos on the food too.  I can't thank you all enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-owasso
Leslie M.,"Tulsa, OK",15,28,47,1.0,10/29/2016,Service sucks.  Got seated.  The restaurant was not that full at all.  There was a team of kids sitting outside but only like10 tables in use inside the restaurant.  Waited about 10 minutes and they did not even get our drink order.  We walked out.  Next.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-owasso
Drew B.,"Owasso, OK",107,329,28,2.0,6/13/2016,"The remodel makes it look pretty much the same? They changed the name and put super annoying TV game ipad looking things on the table. I guess they are encouraging people not to talk to each other or something more sinister... like pay to play the lame games on the ipad thing. The food was ok and the prices were so so. My daughter seemed to be ok with it all, but she eats ramen noodles most of the time by choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-owasso
Debbie B.,"Owasso, OK",7,25,33,3.0,3/23/2016,Food was good but the price for a beer was outrages. . A Blue Moon lg. was 6.59 and a bottle of Not Your Fathers Rootbeer was 5.49 !

Chip S.,"Tulsa, OK",95,23,12,4.0,11/23/2015,First time at Red Robin.  The Black and Blue burger was one of the best burgers I have had.  The Onion Rings are a good addition to the meal.  The waitress was friendly and ensured we had everything we needed.  The food did take some time before we received it but it was worth the wait.   The volume in the restaurant is moderate and they had a good mix playing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-owasso
Jazi H.,"Tulsa, OK",1122,352,2642,4.0,3/14/2014,"My family loves the burgers here! We usually come here to celebrate birthdays or simply get together and we're always a big group (including kids). We have never had a problem with service.  The guacamole bacon burger and sautéed mushroom burger are my favorite. Their fries are amazing too.  I like that they have a couple of games at the entrance too, they're good entertainment while we wait for the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-owasso
Olivia B.,"Owasso, OK",0,21,,4.0,1/15/2017,I had the best waitress ever here!!! I can't remember her name. When she brought out the fries she brought out campfire sauce AND ranch. She read my mind and it made my day. Great food!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-owasso
Tim H.,"Ochelata, OK",4,25,11,1.0,6/4/2015,"Very disappointed.   Tables where so sticky    Said the finish was comming off,  let us rinse it off but will be the same.  Needs fixed.  Ordered a small but brought me a big one...score 1...ordered large onion rings brought me a small...loose 1...said I should have enough to get me full...really now he is my diet counselor.   So I sit there with napkins on the table to not stick to it.  Should have left but gave them a chance to turn it around....loose 1.  Sitting in the bar did not work out well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-owasso

Cory F.,"Owasso, OK",0,5,,1.0,6/12/2015,"Met my girlfriend there for lunch today. The restaurant was nearly empty, but the hostess seated us next to a noisy child and walked away before we could ask to sit at a different table. So we moved ourselves, and were then promptly greeted by our waitress, who presented us with very obviously dirty silverware (1 knife and 3 forks). We ordered water to drink and then shortly after placed our order, and asked for clean silverware. The waitress then delivered a basket of a few steak fries, and when I picked up the Red Robin signature seasoning salt, I was grossed out to discover that it was sticky and grimy.  Very few times in my life have I ever walked out of a restaurant without eating, but there is now one more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-owasso
Aguigui T.,"Tulsa, OK",23,21,,2.0,9/17/2015,"Do you like burgers covered in mayonnaise, then go to Red Robin and come back and give these guys 5 stars. Quality of bread is poor, feels kind of grainy. They definitely put a lot of sugar in their food as well.  Everything I tend to order has the same quality. I can't really recommend anything about this place. If you're used to mediocre burger joints, it might fit into your appetite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-owasso
Jacque S.,"Claremore, OK",4,18,6,1.0,8/2/2015,"This was not our first time to eat at Red Robin, but this is our last.  When they first open a few years ago it was AMAZING food and service. We've watched it go downhill and before it bottoms out, we're jumping ship!   Took my 12 year old there for her birthday this weekend, the kids (yes, I know they are teenagers, but were acting like kids) up at the front took a bit to finish their conversation before they acknowledged that we were even there.  Should've taken that as a sign to leave.  Our waiter was nice, he was also new.  I ordered the chicken tortilla soup, I've had it several times before and really liked it because it tasted fresh. This was not the same soup I've had before, this was canned soup and I do not go out and pay $5.00 for canned soup when I can get it for $1.25 at the store.  Our 13 year old ordered the battered fried cod, I don't know what happened with this but it: stunk, was chewy, and they were drenched with water. It wasn't oil from the frying, it was like someone poured water onto her basket (they don't use plates) and her fish was soggy from the water.  My husband ordered a burger, he said was 'over done and dry' (thanks Bob's Burgers!)  He took 3 bites of it, said the best part was the onion rings on the burger.  Now to the birthday girl, she had chicken strips and mac n cheese.  Her food was good, thankfully, so she shared her lunch with her sister.   We asked to see the manager, it was her first day on the job.  I'm not one to complain at people but it seemed like no one knew what they were doing and they were all new. She took the fish off the ticket, just the fish.  The girls left 1/2 way full, my husband and I left hungry and with $50.00 less in our account.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-owasso
Gary C.,"Muskogee, OK",1,31,,2.0,8/30/2015,"I've lived here for 4 years and this is the first time I've been here and I pretty much figured out why. To begin, the burger was way over cooked and tasted mediocre at best. The waiter never asked if I wanted more fries. It's supposed to be bottomless fries. The waiter also never asked how the food was. Service wasn't good. The only reason for 2 stars is I didn't have to ask to get a refill on my drink.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-owasso
Nick G.,"Owasso, OK",9,6,,4.0,12/7/2014,I have been to Red Robin a few times and each time I've been I have got excellent service. The food is well prepared. Never had to send anything back.

Brandon H.,"Claremore, OK",34,20,17,4.0,2/3/2015,"We like to visit Red Robin on a regular basis.  Their burgers are good.  I am a fan of the Turkey burger myself, but my favorite is their bottomless fries with ranch dressing.  My wife loves their freckled lemonade and the kids usually get the pizza off the kids menu and try to eat all my fries.  We visited there two days ago and had another good experience.  Check it out and make sure to ask them to hook you up with some of those fries to get started on before your meal gets to you.  I just wish they had bigger bowls of fries to bring out to you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-owasso
Andy B.,"Owasso, OK",64,32,16,1.0,5/15/2014,"The burgers are good but it's way over priced.  They have cut their portions of fries to nothing and drag their feet getting you more.

E M.,"Tulsa, OK",0,26,,1.0,9/28/2011,"I don't, didn't like RR because it is so noisy.  But my friend talked me into going there because she likes the Asian Salad.  Or rather ""liked"" the Asian salad. Strike one-  They changed their menu and no longer have the Asian salad. Strike two-  The had not stocked the bar and had to go to their cooler to get their house white wine.  I could not figure out why they made a point of telling me this.  I mean, how far could their cooler be from the bar?  It is not that big of a building. Strike three-  They could not find a cork screw.  What!  A restaurant.  A bar.  And they don't have a cork screw?  We watched them try to push in a cork using a big knife.  Thought for sure we'd get to see the paramedics in action.
