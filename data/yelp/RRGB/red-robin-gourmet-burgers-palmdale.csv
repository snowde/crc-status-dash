To my surprise, a very nice surprise the restaurant has a list of things on a tablet where they show you you can pick what you can have that doesn't have egg or whatever else you might be allergic to and this is the first time I've ever seen this in any place I've ever been.

Faith P.,"Lancaster, CA",66,18,1,1.0,12/29/2017,This was the worst experience I had at red robin. The beer cheese for the pretzel bites was curdled. The bacon was the precooked microwavable bacon. Plus the server touch the inside of the cup my fiancee was drinking out of with her fingers. We received no silverware and had to ask for it AFTER our appetizers and entree came. Then when we paid to leave the server was adamant to have us talk to the manager and would not take no thank you for an answer. She then cursed under her breath and walked away only to turn around and glare at us until we left the establishment. We tried to walk away peacefully and leave peacefully.  After this happened three of us who had literally one bite of the curdled cheese became sick. The f oid wad horrible and made my daughter cry!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-palmdale

Heather P.,"Palmdale, CA",22,52,15,2.0,1/4/2018,"I came in for a few drinks and a bite to eat and was pretty disappointed. All the bathroom stalls were dirty, some of the bathroom doors don't lock. The menu items appear to be multiple variations of the same items just put in different places to make it seem like there is more on the menu. The cocktail list is similar and all very unappealing. I have nothing good nor bad to say about the food we ended up ordering, it was honestly forgettable. The restaurant was not very busy yet there appeared to only be one employee actually working. That was our server Bobby who was also tending the bar and almost every occupied table while trhe rest of the employees we saw just walked around. Bobby was extremely polite and personable and hard working and attentive. The service was really the thing that made the experience ok and not a complete disappointment.

Horacio S.,"Palmdale, CA",150,1,1,1.0,12/21/2016,I am highly disappointed. What is the point of ordering an appetizer if it's going to come at the same time as your entree does? Not just that but we didn't even get napkins until 3/4 into our meal having to ask them. I bet you anything if we never asked for napkins we would have never gotten them. I would like to come to a restaurant with napkins already ready and an appetizer minutes before the main course. Why was I rushed in all this process to eat my food? I couldn't enjoy it whatsoever. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED! UPDATE: There is 2 of us here we ordered more fries and our waitress had the audacity to bring 1 basket of fries with only 10 fries on there? Are you serious!?!?!?!

Daniel J.,"Pasadena, CA",219,79,814,3.0,11/21/2015,"Red Robin is one of my favorite places to eat, and this particular location has always rated between 2 to 5 stars, depending on the day.  My family and I have been here numerous times over the years and we plan to return again, always with the hope of visiting during a 4-star or a 5-star day.     On the best of our visits to this location every aspect of our visit was enjoyable, from the cleanliness of the restaurant to the pleasantness of the staff, and most importantly to the quality of our meals.  When this place is at its best it is very difficult for other restaurants to compare.  The difficulty is, of course, to consistently achieve this rating for every visit.   For the purpose of providing constructive criticism for the management here, and for potential customers, I will now clarify on four of my disappointments over this last year:  (1) My kids' meals have consistently been exceptional, but on some occasions (about one quarter of them) my meals have only been mediocre, from a cold meal to a burger with a noticeably unripe pineapple. (2) The restaurant is usually quite clean, but the bathroom is often less than acceptable.  One example is when I recently entered with my young son and it wreaked of marijuana smoke from a previous visitor.  It was sickening to the point where we had to quickly leave the second we possibly could.  The restrooms also may get visitors from outside the restaurant, outside of the mall, so restrooms should be monitored for cleanliness more frequently than other Red Robin restaurants.   (3) On rare occasions, I have had an unfriendly waitress or hostess.  One example is when the waitress would not make any small talk with me or even make eye contact, and it was unusually awkward, especially in a sit-down restaurant where communication, customer interaction and friendliness are crucial.   I've had this waitress more than once, and had the same experience each time (so it wasn't simply a bad day). But again, this is rare, since all our other waiters and waitresses were totally awesome.   (4) I've always loved the atmosphere at all Red Robin restaurants, but some of the recent changes, at the executive management (national) level, have been rather disappointing.   One example is the recent logo/sign change that was made, from the exciting ""Red Robin"" highlighted above the door in neon lights to the current and boring sign with light-red lettering on a dark-red background.  This was an unwise decision made at the national level, and unfortunately this particular Red Robin location now must conform to this poor decision for consistency.     Once again, I plan to return with my family, with the hope of having a 5-star visit, which I know can occasionally be delivered at this Red Robin.  I can navigate around the one poor waitress.  I'll just try to ignore that dull and boring Red Robin sign out front.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-palmdale?start=20
Franklin T.,"Lancaster, CA",0,19,65,2.0,3/18/2016,"Came here with my sister today because she was craving red robins nagging me until I woke up. We entered, were greeted and seated right away. I haven't been to this red robins in quite awhile but it looks like they remodeled it a bit.  Our server was fairly nice he immediately came to our table after being seated to get our drink orders. About 5 minutes later he came back to take our orders. We got the shorty o-ring tower, black and bleu burger and royal red robin burger. Our food came out really quick which I was kind of impressed about. The onion rings were delicious nice and crispy just the way we like it. My sister enjoyed her Royal red robin burger a lot. I on the other hand felt my black and bleu burger lacked flavor and was kind of dry. At first look it visually looked delicious but when it came to actually eating it I was disappointed. My buns were really soggy idk why the burger wasn't that juicy and the mushroom cuts were way to big to compliment the burger plus there were only two slices.. I had high hopes for my meal but it just didn't meet my expectations at all which weren't high to begin with.

Mike D.,"Palmdale, CA",385,349,2091,4.0,11/26/2013,"I had just finished seeing a movie and was hungry. I checked yelp, I kind of forgot about Red Robin being inside the mall but being that I was pretty much right there I walked on over. I arrived at about 1:30 and there were quite a few people inside. I had seen the yelp complaints about wait times, normally that would be of concern to me but I had a couple of hours to kill before I was to meet someone in Lancaster so I entered. I was quickly seated, handed a menu, and my drink order was taken. Along with the main menu there was a one page special menu and on it was a burger called Smoke & Pepper which included Black-Pepper Bacon, Extra-Sharp Cheddar, House-Made Smoke & Pepper Ketchup, and Smoked Sea Salt on a Toasted Ciabatta Bun, this sounded good and I ordered it when the server returned with my drink. I decided to time how long my order took, after reading some of the yelp comments I was expecting a bit of a wait. 6 minutes later the burger was brought to my table, 6 minutes! And this was during the lunch rush! The burger was very good, cooked the way I like with just a hint of pink at the center. The black pepper bacon and smoke and pepper ketchup gave the burger a bit of a kick. I cleaned the plate, I was asked if I wanted more fries but that would have been overdoing it, I know my limits. I was extremely happy with both the food and the speedy service, I would happily return to try some of the other burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-palmdale?start=60

The best service we got was when someone else was helping her. She didn't ask us if we wanted more fries (we did) and she didn't ask us if we wanted dessert (we did). She just shoved the check at me before we were even finished.  But tonight is a new low. We have a tradition of going to Red Robin on my daughter's birthday because I was in labor with her when I ate there. Tonight was the last time we will ever go there again.

She started to take us to the back of the restaurant when we noticed a window seat so we politely asked for that. She gave us a put upon look at sat us there. We waited about ten minutes for service and nothing so we saw some gizmo on the table pressed the button for waiter and still nothing. Finally a waitress comes walking by so we stopped her and said we have been here for a long time and don't even have a drink yet. She said wait a minute I will see who your server is. Still nothing and then finally some guy comes out and starts talking to the table next to us with chitter chatter. SO we got up and left.

Parking is not easy to find due to this location is in the mall. Ugh... Went inside and it seemed like it was nice sized location. Staff seemed friendly but extremely busy which can be good and bad at the same time. I suppose it depends on if you are in a hurry or not. I ordered a bowl of chili and my husband ordered some type of burger wrapped in lettuce with an extra patty. We didn't order anything extravagant but I wasn't impressed with either. Red Robin is known for their burgers and bottomless fries but I don't see what's so great about their burgers. If I want frozen, not fresh burgers then I would rather eat fast food for a bit cheaper. There seems to be a lot of families that frequent this location. Kids galore so if you are looking for a somewhat quiet burger place then this is not a viable option. Cleanliness was pretty decent for being as busy as it was with the amount of kids that were there. Bathrooms were ok as well. Overall, my experience was ok.

I know salads are not too exciting but when I have gone to other places the salads are good with fresh lettuce and plenty of toppings. This one was some lettuce, little bit of onions on the side a piece of chicken and avocado on the side, don't remember tomatoes, limes or parsley as stated on the description. BBQ sauce and ranch were on the side, usually the dressing is mixed into the salad. The plate was the size of the salad so it was hard to mix all the ingredients together.  After we left I realized they didn't give me the garlic toast as also stated on the description. Cost of this sad salad was $10.49 :(. I buy the BBQ chicken salad from trader joes for $4 and it is much better. No drink refills offered. We also ordered a side of fries no refills offered either. When the waiter came around it seemed like he was in a hurry and briskly walked by while asking how was everything. Sons order was wrong but he said he would just eat it and didn't want me to ask for another since they took a while the first time around. This was during lunch and they were not busy. My other son ordered the chicken strips which came with 3 measly fries on the side.  When I asked for 3 to go boxes you would think he'd know to bring a bag, I mean how I'm suppose to carry 3 boxes along with my shopping bags.

Sandie C.,"Lancaster, CA",8,61,3,2.0,11/1/2011,"What happened to Red Robin??  This used to be a reliable corporate chain restaurant that I'd go to with friends and family but I think that yesterday will count as the last day I will ever go to the Red Robin in the Antelope Valley Mall.  In fact, given the shrunken menu, I don't think I'll bother with Red Robin anymore. The menu used to be interesting with many, many more choices than is offered now.  The menu is probably less than half of what it was.  It doesn't help that my favorite entrees have been chopped.  No more Tuna Foccacia sandwich.  No more wild salmon sandwich.  BOOO!  Instead, just a bunch of soggy burgers and deep fried boredom.  You'd think that with less of a menu to worry about, whoever's cooking it would do a good job.  Guess again. My companion didn't finish all his salad because he thought the luke warm chicken tasted suspicious.  I tried a piece and it tasted way over seasoned and over processed.  Yeah, you'd better not eat that.  My burger, a swiss cheese and mushroom job, was soggy and luke warm as were the french fries.  It tasted as though it had been made in advance and shoved under a not very hot heat lamp.  Our server disappeared and I made the mistake of eating half the burger before calling it quits.  I've never had such poor food at any Red Robin before and, for me, one bad experience of anything in most cases is enough for me to cut my losses and never return.  There would have to be some redeeming quality for me to continue to waste time/spend money.  Why keep punishing yourself?  Luke warm stodgy food is one of those things that is definitely unforgivable and, in the end, may have made me sick. The place was empty at the time of day I visited which is unusual.  This place used to be packed.  Now, they have just a couple of servers and the food takes longer than you'd expect to arrive at the table.  This could be down to the economy which would explain the condensed and boring menu and the lack of patrons.  Maybe I just visited on an off day but the lack of customers tells me differently.  The lack of customers could also be due to the fact that there's a Claim Jumper and a newish Yard House just up the way which is where we should've gone with everyone else. Red Robin are pushing a 'Red Royalty' customer reward card.   There was a time when I would've requested a card with the plan to use it in the future.  Now, I don't think I'll ever go back.  Time to move on and see what else is out there in corporate chain land because it appears that Red Robin and its bare bones menu are done and there are other places where I can enjoy a decent meal I believe. Two stars only because of misty tuna foccacia memories plus our server was friendly.  Minus the friendly server and I would only rate the food I received yesterday at ONE STAR.  Food should never be served luke warm.  AWFUL.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-palmdale?start=140

Jim T.,"Rosamond, CA",39,65,89,4.0,4/1/2011,"This Red Robin is a bit hit-and-miss.  It's usually great: good food, excellent prices, and great service.  However, sometimes they're VERY understaffed and the service is unacceptably slow.  I'd give them five stars if they could get their act together and be consistent with the service. I strongly recommend the Natural Burger for those looking for a calorie deal.  It's about half the calories of their other burgers (547) and is absolutely delicious.  Order it with melon instead of fries for a healthy alternative. If you're not looking for a calorie reduced option, the bottomless drink list is long and includes root beer floats!  Also their Mud Pie is huge and delicious.  They have a variety of happy hour specials at the bar, too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-palmdale?start=140
Tracy O.,"Palmdale, CA",7,7,,3.0,7/13/2014,"I generally enjoy going to RR for dinner and drinks, but was pretty disappointed with the service I received a few days ago. My friend and I went here for dinner and a beer, excited to hang out because it had been awhile since we had seen eachother. When my friend ordered her beer, the waitress was rude to her, questioning her as to why her ID was bent, as if she wasn't of age to drink. After the ID situation, she continued to give me an attitude because I wasn't ready to order when she would come to our table. The waitress ended up telling me to flag her down, which I don't find to even be slightly professional in a restaurant. Our food was good, which is pretty typical for Red Robin. I ordered & split the bruschetta chicken sandwich & bottomless fries with my girl friend, and it was yummy as usual. Definitely recommend.

I'm not one to complain usually but it's not that hard to fry up new fries especially since my boyfriend is a cook he knew right away and so did I they really tasted horrific neither of us ate them nor did we want more so, so much for ""bottomless"" steak fries people would actually want to eat. I was so disappointed and their burgers weren't that great either they were left sitting in the window for sometime before we even got them.

They have great Thousand Island dressing for dipping. I have to knock our location for two minor things. First, it's in a mall (not their fault, but I hate malls!). Second, we do takeaway quite a bit since we have small children, and they made mistakes with our order the last two times. It's been the same mistake two times in a row, and my husband said what he wanted three times, but it was still wrong.

I asked him to talk to manager, because clearly, I have a coupon that was sent to be by Red Robin. The manager, Pedro,  actually said there wasn't anything he could do without my account. Seriously! We're talking about a $4.00 discount. It was pure principal at this point. Your company sent me a coupon, you need to honor it! The waiter was great, and tried helping us.

The host, Lucy, acted like she really didn't care and didn't want to talk to the lady. She just told her that the manager was coming. When the manager showed up, the lady explained what happened. The manager also acted like she (as a customer) did not matter. I never heard him apologize. He said he could get her seated, but her party had already left due to the situation. I still hadn't been able to put my name in. A guy walked up behind me and met with a waitress (I'm guessing they were friends or family). She put their name in and jumped everyone in line waiting. After I put my name in, I watched the waitress let the host know that she had a table opening and that it was specifically for that party she had put on the list. I don't think this was right. She shouldn't be able to jump the line and get people in faster than the people who had been waiting. The service I saw, before I even got seated, was terrible!

They had no bacon for their bacon burger and no onion rolls.  The server said that the management was not too sharp and it shows with glee.  The server was fine but the place itself has gone downhill.

Eton B.,"Palmdale, CA",0,8,,1.0,9/15/2017,"Pains me to do this...my family, which consists of me and the wife and three young kids, would come here at least once a week.  The food was always good, the service was always good, the kids would be entertained with the decorations and the game console at the table, mom and dad could relax and enjoy a meal...but, the last few times we have come here, it has been a totally different experience.  Keep in mind, due to us having young kids, we come for dinner at 4:00ish to beat the rush and it is typically fairly slow...so you'd think the service would be spot on...not so much.  From the hostess to the server, the service is so slow.  And keep in mind, this is NOT during the dinner rush.  No one even has the decency to even say ""hey, sorry, I know we are a little slow.  I'm new..."" or whatever...but instead, you are literally left without being checked on for at least 15 minutes at a time...at least.  We have seen multiple people just walk out...sometimes it's people waiting for a hostess to even come to the front to seat them.  It really has gotten to the point where it is flat out ridiculous how bad the service is...one time we were there for thirty minutes at our table before not only placing a drink order but even being acknowledged!  I've seen a few new faces in there so I'm not sure if that's what the problem is but either way, it's kinda doesn't matter...it's extremely bad.  I hate to be ""that person"" but we are no longer going to frequent this establishment.  We will try applebees as our family's outing once a week.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-palmdale?start=40

That makes all the difference! He even brought us some fries to hold us over until the food arrived.  Also, any time our drinks were about to empty, our waiter was there with a refill.  As usual, the food was great.  I got the cluck and fries and my friend got a newer item from the healthier section.  We both enjoyed our dinners.  I always have a good experience at Red Robin.  Professional staff, prompt attention, and excellent food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-palmdale?start=40
Eric C.,"Lancaster, CA",77,27,8,2.0,7/13/2016,"Well this was an interesting experience. For starters, the restaurant was nowhere near busy right at dinner time. Then we are asked how we want our burgers cooked, We ordered the Rare Whiskey River Burger and the Medium Rare Fiery Ghost Burger. Sadly what we got were two burgers made from shoe leather with no pink to be found. I am sure the meat was lean, because these were anything but juicy. And while the burgers on the menu looked appetizing, what we both got looked like McDonald's cheeseburgers, flat and unimpressive, and not even as tasty. If you want a good barbecue burger, go get a Whiskey BBQ burger from Carl's Jr.  Then there were the fries, which by pale in comparison to Five Guys right down the street. Ok, I'm done with my rant... Won't be going back there again.  Whiskey:  Fiery Ghost: ",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-palmdale?start=40

Even though it was lunch time and pretty busy, we only waited a few minutes before being seated in a two-seater booth.  Despite being busy, our waitress was on point and very quick with our orders. I was disappointed to see my fav. chicken sandwich was no longer on the menu, but I decided to order the crispy chicken with mustard instead of mayo. The sandwich was pretty big and by time we got our food, I was starving and thought I would be able to finish my food, but I was able to eat half of the sandwich and finished the chicken, minus the bread and fixings. Along with the fries, my hubs ordered a side of campfire sauce, which taste very similar to in and outs secret sauce.

Bri H.,"Palmdale, CA",43,172,183,3.0,9/5/2015,"I'm pretty bummed about the recent remodel. While it looks nice, their prices for the food have staggeringly gone up.

My burger and fries favorite go-to item went from 7.99 to 9.99 with no additions for my benefit. Seriously? That's a crazy price jump.  I love their burgers and the servers have always been super accommodating. However I think we'll be eating here far less in the future. The Habits burgers are just as amazing, far less pricey and I don't have to tip cause it's fast food.

The kids working the hostess station were busy and weren't as friendly as usual, but not in any way rude. We always sit in the bar unless we're with guests that have children. This particular Sunday we both ordered regular ""no frills"" bacon cheeseburgers and fries. We had our favorite server, Joey who is always professional and down to earth. No scripted responses. I hate scripted responses! He never writes the order down and never forgets anything. Food was exactly as ordered and tasted delicious! We run the gamut when we dine here and have tried everything from the gourmet burgers, fish items, pastas, sandwiches and chicken dishes. It's always consistent and fairly priced for the amount of food you receive. I like that you have a size option on the wine (6 or 9 oz.) and the beer choices are plenty.
