Some places are such a pain to order from and the woman who took our order was great, easy to understand and nailed our order. She also did a great job of estimating the time that it would be ready and was very thorough. It was ready with all the bells and whistles when we came to pick it up, no wait at all!

Robyn L.,"Papillion, NE",7,6,,4.0,9/2/2017,"I live right in the neighborhood so this has become a pretty common stop for me with the kiddos. Most of the time we get awesome servers. You can't help that occasionally you get a teen who doesn't want to be there. The food is consistent. Unlimited fries are the coolest. Their poppy seed honey mustard is TO DIE FOR!!!   They have gluten free and any other weird health conscious thing you want. The rewards system is So-So but worth it for the occasional free or half off burger.  They have chalk boards for the kids to play with at the table if the crayons and menu are boring.   Lots of options for the kids menu too. My lil princess loves the meatball lollipops.  The burger menu changes enough so you can try a new fangled burger with some inane topping like mac n cheese or waffles or Scooby snacks or whatever is popular. But the standard Burgers are yummy. The fried shrimp are pretty damn good too.  Oh, last thing. I'm not a fan of the mixed drinks but I like a heavy pour. Most chains don't do a heavy pour. No biggie. They do a large glass of wine and that's the bees knees for me. They have lots of beers too. And desserts. It's all good. It's a chain but a good chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-papillion
Justin B.,"Bellevue, NE",37,65,12,3.0,6/15/2017,"Red Robin. What to say about Red Robin. I have been eating here since I was in high school (15 years ago). Hamburgers are still big and juicy as they have always been; and I do like their new tavern burger menu. The prices have gone up, and the tavern burger menu is what hamburgers should cost. This facility always is kept clean and presentable. The servers are attentive, and paying is easy. You can pay right at the table on the ipad-screen-stand-computer-thing. Never paid at one where it wasn't out of receipt paper, but still convenient.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-papillion

Our server Emily was high energy and had us laughing the entire time. She took our drink out and they were at the table in the blink of an eye. I ordered the Banzai burger which is a teriyaki burger with pineapple, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and mayo.. I had mine sans tomato and mayo. I also had an Oreo milkshake and my goodness was that delicious! I'm tempted to go back today just to get one.. it was thick and I like milkshakes that you have to work for. Anywho, as I'm still drooling over this milkshake, back to the food.. Red Robin is known for their bottomless fries and everything delivered! Food came out quick, taste was there and on top of a cool server this experience was great! Come on Tuesday's for military discounts as well! I'm getting my milkshake today for sure though!

Samantha G.,"Chicago, IL",1090,1717,2677,3.0,12/28/2015,"This is a nice enough location. It's clean and well-kept. The wait can be up to 30 minutes when it's busy. Lots of families, of course. There's a couple of arcade games for the kiddos while you wait. (Tip: There's a change machine so you can get quarters.) There's also a kiosk at each table with additional (free) games. The tables are close together, but not too close. The service was a bit lacking, but they were very busy. We weren't checked on and missed the opportunity to order more items. And it felt a bit rushed. The beer list is very meh. We're talking like only 4 beers and they were all crappy ones. They do have a nice selection of lemonades and milkshakes. The kids menu has plenty of options. The regular menu has a whole bunch of options. I appreciated the multitude of dipping sauces. The onion rings were tasty. The poutine fries were decent. The nacho tavern burger was alright. It lacked flavor. For a chain restaurant, it's a-ok.

Jennifer A.,"Columbia, MO",0,10,29,5.0,9/12/2016,Excellent meal and service. We were there for a late lunch on a Monday.  Service was fast and attentive. We sat in the bar area.

Husband had the red robin burger which has the fried egg on it and he said it was excellent.  He ordered a salted caramel shake and it was phenomenal!  Definitely taste the salt with it and was fantastic.  Like this chain but have had hit and miss around the country.

Kurt S.,"Council Bluffs, IA",67,502,346,4.0,10/9/2014,"Red Robin, YUUUUUUUUUM.  That about sums up my review of my experience at this Red Robin last weekend. My wife walked in and we were immediately seated.  We both decided to get water as our beverage.  I ordered the Fish and Chips and my wife ordered some Turkey sandwich. The Fish was hot, crispy on the outside, and a tad moist on the inside - perfect IMO.  The fries were just the right amount of crispiness and were delicious as always.  The tarter sauce that came with the fish was pretty good as well.  It was a tad pricey at $13.99 but after eating it, and taking some of it home to eat for another meal, it was worth the money. My wife and I were out here running some errands but I can definitely see us going back when we are at the Shadow Lake shopping area again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-papillion

Chad K.,"Gretna, NE",18,450,462,2.0,5/29/2015,"I've been to Red Robin probably 5 times over the last 6 years and at three different locations.  My overall opinion is that the place just sells overpriced burgers with little justification for the pricing. For years my friends have made fun of my willingness to go to upscale gastropubs and taverns and order $12 hamburgers.  They were appalled at my willingness to spend so much on a such a basic entrée. I would try and explain that a hamburger patty made with ground ribeye instead of ground chuck, a house baked bun that wasn't a mass-market sesame seed bun, and topings like watercress instead of lettuce made for a great burger that totally justified the price.  However, Red Robin typically charges $10+ fpr many of their burgers and everyone seems to be okay with paying that much for a basic burger patty, with basic ingredients, from a chain restaurant.  Why would I go eat an average burger at Red Robin for $10 when for a dollar or two more I can go have a superb burger at any one of several upscale gastropubs? For me, one of the joys of French fries is that yummy ratio of fried crispy outer layer to soft steamy inside.  Steak fries just don't have a good ratio (too much of the latter and not enough of the former).  It's like someone cut a potato in half and called it fries.  I'm not surprised that they are ""all you can eat"" steak fries.  Since each fry is the equivalent of about an eighth of a potato, how many can any one person honestly eat?  Each small plate of fries they bring you is the equivalent of eating an entire potato. To mix it up, I tried substituting their Chili Chili™ Cheese Fries in place of their steak fried for a $3 up-charge. They were not good.  Chili is not good chili, overall texture of the dish is terrible.  Easily some of the worse chili cheese fries I've ever had.  Sonic Drive-In does a better job with chili cheese fries than Red Robin does. Service is friendly if not particularly attentive. This restaurant is clean and well-maintained.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-papillion

Eric O.,"La Vista, NE",1,31,50,4.0,5/29/2017,"For burger lovers like myself, Red Robin falls into a revolving selection of good burger establishments.  Red Robin offers casual seating and is great for children!  The restaurant offers other types of food, but it's a burger chain and that's where the quality is at!  The restaurant has a selection of classic burgers that doesn't change, and features beef and chicken varieties.  My favorites include the Royal Red Robin burger (burger with a fried egg on it), the Whiskey River BBQ burger (barbeque and onion straws), and the Bonzai burger (teriyaki and grilled pineapple).  The restaurant also has an extensive selection of appetizers.  Within the last couple years, Red Robin introduced the Tavern Double lineup.  They are smaller double cheeseburgers available in a variety of flavors.  You can make them larger for an upcharge.  They have varieties such as Sriracha, Macaroni and Cheese, and others.  But the best part about Red Robin is the bottomless steak fries.  Pair them with the licensed Red Robin seasoning and dip them in ranch and they can't be beat!!! The atmosphere is welcoming, with comfortable seating, TV's, and more!  The prices are reasonable, somewhat on the high side in my opinion.  I took my 3 year old son to late lunch and our tab was $23 after tax and tip.  My family of 6 eats for closer to $50-$55. Red Robin does have a rewards club which is a great value.  Buy 9 burgers and your 10th is free.  You always get a BOGO burger on your birthday",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-papillion

Up until sometime last year, burgers came in a handy paper wrapper in a basket, with a generous helping of fries. Now the burgers come on a plate, with very few fries, and the waitstaff probably won't offer more fries until you're ready to leave.

After about 20 minutes, and eating half of her meal, she complained. I held her food under the light and looked closer at the chicken fingers. THEY WERE RAW. My daughter had consumed over a tender of purely RAW chicken. As I threw down the chicken I was holding in my hand, I had to stop myself from getting sick. The manager did not seemed phased and offered a measly 25% off our ticket. We left the rest of our food, paid the bill and left in a hurry. Never in my life have I been this disappointed as a consumer. It is one thing as an adult to get food poisoning, but now we are at home and my daughter is sick to her stomach.

Our visit a few weeks ago, after we were sat our waiter walked past us for almost 10 full minutes before coming over & saying, I guess no one is taking care of you guys so I'll just do it. The kitchen was backed up that night & we had a very long wait, the server apologized & brought out our food, meal by meal as it became ready. Tonight, again the service was just terrible. Our server brought out the adult drinks & we waited several more minutes for kids drinks. When they finally came he didn't have any straws & said he'd be back with some. We never got any. I finally gave my younger kids our straws & the older ones took their lids off. When our food came I'd ordered a bacon burger. It came with cheese which I didn't ask for (maybe it's that way on the menu but it's what I order every time & never get cheese). I also order my burger lettuce wrapped but they just sat it on the lettuce wedges instead of wrapping it in paper like is usually done. Again, I know this because I order the same thing every time & it's always wrapped in paper. My son got Mac & cheese & it had no spoon. The server who brought our food (different person) seemed annoyed & said I'll get you one. Shockingly, never returned. I just can't return to this location. I love RR so we'll go to other ones but I can't come back here unless I'm full up on patience & time.
