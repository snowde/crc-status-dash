Stephanie T.,"Bergen County, NJ",190,200,1136,5.0,1/1/2018,"Not sure why this location received such critical reviews. My visit here was nothing short of amazing. The waitress was very pleasant and available when we needed her. The food was excellent. I tried the quinoa veggie burger - delicious. The mudd pie was delicious. A large portion, enough for 2 to 3 people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus
Grace Lee A.,"New York, NY",37,335,54,1.0,8/12/2017,"I enjoy Red Robin but not the establishment and not the service. It is really hit or miss, and when it's a miss it is just absolutely sh*tty.  Just god awful. Deanna was our server and she seemed courteous in the beginning then things quickly went sour when she started making stank faces at us and at some point thrust the menu in my husbands face when he asked to see it again, and it was baffling how nasty she was. She literally threw the automated table side computer thing in front of him when he told her he wanted to put his royalty number into the order. Wow! Then she goes to the next table and turned on this dr jekyl and Hyde multiple personality thing and was gushing smiling at them and asked them how their meal was and she did not ask us once how our meal was or asked if we need a drink refill.   This is why when I have a craving for Red Robin, my better judgment kicks in and stops me. The service is horrific and inconsistent. Deanna just proved to me that there is no hope for Red Robin as a service establishment. Is management in this company so horrendous that all their workers are persistently unhappy and nasty to their customers? I believe their store manager name is Adolfo, and I only know this because I heard a complaining customer at another table inquiring for his name.  Our service tonight was so atrocious that i will be calling him out for the poor attitude of his store staff, specifically Deanna.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus
Rohit S.,"Dumont, NJ",8,74,205,2.0,11/14/2017,"10 years ago this place was one of my preferred places to go, but what awake up call! Aside from the strawberry freckled lemonade everything was pretty awful. I couldn't believe I had stopped watching Stranger Things season 2 episode 7 to go here (should have ordered in). The nachos were horrible and I had to send them back because of the cold chili. After that everything was an entire disaster. I wish I was Toothless so I could not even attempt to eat this. I didn't complete the meal nor did my wife as it was overly greasy. Jingle, ""Red Robin...Nope.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus
Cara C.,"Little Ferry, NJ",77,26,24,2.0,1/14/2018,"I've waited almost 2 years to return here for a meal! Party of 8, two families.  We were seated and ordered.. I pleaded for a burger with some pink and not well done.  I asked nicely three times before our waitress left.  The burger came completely brown and well done.. the waitress never came back to even get a chance to ask for a new one.  My husband got up and brought the burger back.  Three people had empty glasses the majority of their meal bc the waitress just never came back.  The manager delivered my burger and apologized. We told him we needed drinks and wanted to order dessert.  5 mins later drinks still didn't come.  We stopped the waitress when she was walking by to ask for drinks again lol I felt like we were bothering her.  We are two nice families with kids, we didn't ask for anything other than drink refills which seemed like such a huge ask.  Our desserts were free which was appreciated for the lengthy visit and mishaps but it's just mind-boggling that this location cannot seem to get its act together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus
Tarique T.,"Englewood, NJ",40,4,2,2.0,1/6/2018,This place was just alright my burger didn't have too much flavor and the fries was flavorless. The angry orchard that i had was good though. My server held it down.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus
Brendalynne F.,"Lodi, NJ",544,190,1887,4.0,1/14/2017,"ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW: - Amazing and perfectly cooked burgers - Best fries (RR serves my all-time favorite fries) and Freckled Lemonade ever. AND THEY'RE BOTH BOTTOMLESS. - Great service (Our server from yesterday, Nelly, was especially awesome!) I also love that RR is one of the many restaurants that uses those electronic pads on each table that allow you to call your server, order more food/drinks, and pay for your check whenever you're ready.  ---------------------------------- MY ADVICE FOR MANAGEMENT (and the reason why I deducted a star): ***Please be mindful of your incoming crowd on busy Friday/weekend nights, and have enough hosts working to handle that crowd.*** Last night (Friday) around 8pm, I patiently waited at the host stand for over 5 minutes for someone to write my name down as I watched the hostess run all over the place. (I'm used to waiting for a table on busy nights, but not so much for someone to simply write my name down and tell me how long the wait is.) When she finally stopped running around, she just started taking names in the middle of the room instead of at the host stand. When I politely said ""excuse me"" to grab her attention, she put up her index finger at me as if to silence me then ignored me for a few seconds. Then she looked up, realized she never wrote my name down, then someone seated our table of 2 right away. I ALWAYS give a restaurant the benefit of the doubt and I even saw the manager running the food out to help, so I'm assuming someone called out or was late. But at the end of the day, the host is the person who sets your dining standard upon walking into a restaurant and there should always be someone up there to greet the guests and put them on a wait list if it's busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus
Kasia L.,"Elmwood Park, NJ",144,13,4,2.0,12/29/2017,"Me and my sister decided to grab lunch here. When we walked in there was a lot of people near the entrance waiting to be seated and a hostess no where to be found. We stood there for a good 10 minutes until one of the waitresses came by and took names down and seated everyone. Once we got seated, we  put in our drink, appetizer & entree orders at once because we both knee what we wanted. We didn't get our drinks for another 20 minutes. When we got our appetizer, the soggy pretzel bites, our burgers came out like a minute after so we had all the food out together. My sister got the new sriracha tavern doue burger and I ordered the taco tavern double. My burger was missing pretty much all the ingredients that made it a taco tavern burger... I told my server and she said that's the right order but quickly got me a new burger. It didn't really taste as expected. Probably won't be coming back here too soon",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus
Mike G.,"Hackensack, NJ",0,7,1,1.0,12/31/2017,"God awful. If horse manure was a restaurant this is what it would be. I'm sorry to the managers and owners because they are really nice but don't come here. I've been coming here since it opened and it has gone down hill as drastically. At first it was a good place for a burger and would often drive decent crowds. Since then, they've started to slack off in food quality. For example on my most recent visit, the cake I had was as hard as a rock. Now nobody comes here and there are more employees there than customers. It's honestly creepy. I've also seen fights break out here and the workers saying that that is pretty normal and we shouldn't worry about it. Overall this restaurant is awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus
Andrew L.,"Fort Lee, NJ",42,107,134,4.0,11/29/2016,"3.5 stars rounded up but be warned: service is very (very) hit or miss. Otherwise it's one of the better RR locations I've checked out. So far, every time Red Robin releases a new experimental burger, this place always has it on time (like the chicken & waffle sandwich). It isn't always made the way it's described but everything still tastes good. I've never had to wait for a table longer than 5 minutes. Most of the times there are plenty of seats, actually. And at the tables they've implemented Ziosk, the tablet to order, checkout, play games, and call server (which doesn't seem to do anything besides flash a light).

Patti F.,"River Edge, NJ",11,39,54,3.0,5/30/2017,"I will admit that I am usually disappointed whenever I come here.  I don't like any sauces so no matter what burger I order, I ask for it without the sauce and guess what?  It NEVER comes that way.  So, either I send it back and have to wait while everyone else is eating or i try to wipe off the offending condiment and eat while complaining the whole time.  Did I mention that I am a joy to dine with? No? Hahaha I chose to order salsa chicken and not a burger.  Salsa is the only condiment I eat.  Chicken came as expected and the side salad I ordered without dressing actually came without dressing! The food itself was okay.  The chicken was a little dry.  The salsa had an odd taste.  I think it had too much lime in it.   Red Robin will never be a place I actively seek out to dine,  but if the group wants to go I will go.  I guess I will just have to stick to non burger food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus

Yerika J.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,3,,2.0,11/15/2017,I went here yesterday at my daughter's request. We quickly regretted it. She was hungry and beginning to have a headache so we figured this would be pretty quick and easy. We were wrong. I will say that the host and waiter were friendly. But we had to wait so long for everything. The place was pretty empty and yet it took an extremely long time for our order to be put in and then to get our order. After admitting to forget to put our order in the waiter cane back to tell us they didn't even have what my daughter ordered. I felt so bad as her headache just kept getting worse during all this wait.  I just don't understand all the waiting and issues on such a slow night. Their solution was to bring fries while we waited and then a free dessert that my daughter kept saying she didn't even want.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus

Gianni A.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",248,65,91,1.0,7/7/2017,"Since I had the day off from work, I decided to take my kids out to lunch so I decided in Red Robin. The hostess was nice and sat us down. We waited about 10 minutes for the waitress to come by our table and asked if we were ready. We gave her the drink order while we decided on what we wanted. The waitress came by 10 minutes later and we ordered the food. My kids and I felt like the waitress was not helpful, cordial or even human.... she acted more like a robot (no feelings or reactions). The food was ok but I remember when the food was great. The over all experience was very poor and did not leave me with a great taste in my mouth.

Nick A.,"Teaneck, NJ",82,23,21,1.0,1/26/2017,"Our 1st time going to Red Robin. We went around lunch time. Walking through the door we stood to an empty restaurant. I know they were open cause I saw people sitting and eating. What I didn't see were employees. So right about the time we started to sit ourselves, someone came out of the kitchen. He sat us and left. A server came up to the table and asked if we ever been there before we, Responded no. She took our drink order and shortly after we ordered my daughters food and nachos to share. Meatballs on a stick.  Moments later the server came back and we ordered our food. My wife ordered a ghost chili burger well done and I ordered a pepper something burger med rare.  So the nachos and my daughters food came out. The nachos were good. My daughters food on the other hand wasn't. The meatballs were rock hard and cold. Only thing she ate was 2 helping of broccoli and fries from our meal.several times I had to ask for a refill and napkins.  My wife's burger came out which she was happy about. My burger was over cooked. I asked the server if she could take it back. I explained that I ordered the burger med rare and it was cooked well done. She apologized and told it back. Meanwhile my wife only took a couple bits waiting for my food to arrive. Approx 5mins went by and it returned. Now I was expecting a raw burger. How cooked can a burger get after cooking for about 5mins..  well I cut it open and it was well done again!!! Questing the freshness of the burger. I believe they precook the food. This time I waved down a manager. She claimed to be in training. I asked if I could speak to someone that cold help if she couldn't. She told me to tell her what's I needed to. After explaining about our issues, she stated that we needed to talk to the manger. So a manger came out of the kitchen. She came to the table pretty much yelling at us. She stated that they don't cook the burgers under med what restaurant doesn't know how to cook. To continue getting a temp wrong. For a manager to come to the table to say this is crazy! When asking her name she refused to tell me when I asked for the general managers name she looked at me and walked away.  Since they had a thing on the table to pay we did it that way. They were taking forever to return to the table with the check. When I called the corp number the lady on the phone say in order to get any kind of gift card everyone from my group had to call and complain. This includes my 15mth daughter. She said this was Red Robin's policy..  wow really!!  This place is just better to drive by it and go somewhere else",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus

Isaiah C.,"Paterson, NJ",61,7,6,5.0,4/20/2017,"Went shopping near by and decided to stop in with the family. One thug is have to say is the customer service was probably the most impressive thing. We greeted within a couple seconds of entering the place and seated and had our drink orders taken all within the first 30 seconds of being in the place.  We started with a teriyaki wings as a starter, and to drink a coke, lemonade and a baileys shake. Accept for the shake the drinks were there within a minute and the shake came about 3-4 min later with the starter maybe a couple of minutes after that. At this point we had already placed our order with Deanna (our server) with DBear fixing and bringing our drinks which is a good system since it allowed for less wait time and quick service.  I had a salmon entree and burger with broccoli and fries which was very good. No complaints and ended up leaving a seemingly clean plate. Fries weren't drenched I salt like most places have a habit of doing. The salmon was well cooked and tasted great and the broccoli was at the perfect texture. My baileys drink was amazing and I even got the opportunity to try their cookies and cream shake via there rewards program. I've been to other locations many times and I have never even had someone even mention that they had a program similar to Fridays strips program. Opted not to have desert but just because all of us were already satisfied. All in all great experience food and service and the general atmosphere was great. Place was clean not too loud and staff was extremely friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus

Bill R.,"South Hackensack, NJ",0,1,,1.0,9/28/2016,I want to update this post. Red Robin asked me to send my contact information to them which I did about an hour after they requested it. I still have not heard anything from them. Very disturbing  I would like to warn anyone who goes to this restaurant that your safety and your personal belongings are at risk. My wife's cell phone was stolen off the table. The manager refused to look at the security cameras to see who did it. The phone remained inside the building for almost 4 hours proving it was an employee of red robin. The manager Ahmad Told the police and myself that there were 4 iPads stolen from the restaurant by the employees and this was confirmed by Paramus PD police reports. No action by mgr confirms the problems there. Wanted to send a $30 gift card for our trouble,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=20
Jessi T.,"Maywood, NJ",287,351,201,5.0,12/9/2016,"I've been to this Red Robin twice before my last visit.  I've always tended to avoid it because I wasn't crazy about the service or the food but this last time was awesome.  Two palms up.  It's a 10. 1. Speed- The food came out quickly.  I was starving.  Thank you, Red Robin. 2. Service- The service was friendly and awesome. The waitress made me feel welcome and helped elevate my dining experience with her great attitude. 3. Burger- Usually, the food is too greasy but my Whiskey River BBQ burger was made just right and a Hail Mary burger in my desperate time of hunger.  I've ordered this burger before and it's usually so messy and greasy.  This time, it was on point and perfect.  I ate it with very, very minimal bbq mess to the hands. 4. Electronic thingy- Their electronic ordering thingy at the table (it looks like a tablet) actually worked properly.  A few times, I've had these things on my table as defunct table ornaments but this worked great and made paying and ordering extra things a very easy thing. 5. Dessert- Um, have you tried the mudpie?  It's like, the dream of my childhood.  It's like a gigantic slice of ice cream cake but made with oreos.  It's fantastic.  It's very sweet.  It's self indulgent to order it.  It's awesome. 6. Clean bathroom- Hooray for cleanliness! 7. Lowered sink in bathroom- There's a tiny sink in the bathroom for your tiny child to clean their tiny hands without you having to carry them up to the stink to do it.  How thoughtful of Red Robin to make that. 8. Location- Located on the not busy side of The Bergen Town Center, there's ample parking, which is a big plus during the holiday season. 9. Bottomless fries- Their fries were great and not greasy and also, you can refill your fries.  Who does that? 10.  Freckled lemonade- I had forgotten how much I loved this drink.  It's awesome.  It has sweetened strawberries pureed and sliced, put into the drink.  A lot of times, I don't like too sweet, but this is a sweet drink that I like.  Definitely, get this drink, as long as you aren't allergic to strawberries.  Or lemons. And bonuuuusss..... they have a bar!  I love bars and a good drink.  Does that make me sound alcoholic?  Actually, I don't think I've ever had a drink at this Red Robin but it's always nice to know that the option is there. I will definitely go back.  Hopefully, after I run a marathon because I gained about 10lbs after eating all the delicious food here.  Also, don't come in here judging this place with standards meant for Per Se.  It's Red Robin for crying out loud!  It's awesome for Red Robin and comparable restaurants.  The service though, that could've been high end.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=20
James W.,"New York, NY",158,231,289,5.0,9/18/2016,"The food is sub-par, but my experience with the service was first class all the way. My server was a gentleman named Koray and Red Robin executives need to give this man a gold star.  My family and I came to this location tonight, despite the 2-star overall Yelp rating, my nephews were craving pizza and this was the closest option. The food is not great. So many other things went wrong. The clam chowder and mac and cheese were ""watery."" The restaurant was also sold out of the whole wheat hamburger buns. But, I really didn't care because Koray was a great server and provided amazing service. He was very prompt and attentive continuously asking us if we needed any refills on our bottomless sides and drinks. He was knowledgeable about the Red Robin menu and went to great lengths to explain what a Red Robin Tavern was. He apologized profusely when they ran out of the whole wheat hamburger bun and offered a plethora of other bun options. He even informed us how we could get half-off for our kid's dinner. He was so generous with his time and hospitality, we decided to still pay full price for the kid's meals. The guy was a great salesman and told us to come back on other nights when they would have ""specials."" I would gladly return because of our experience with Koray.

Jason P.,"Bronx, NY",182,400,3264,3.0,8/15/2016,"OKay, so I can totally see why this place would have the Yelp rating it does. I have been wanting to try Red Robin for a while. The marketing geniuses with their ...Red Robin...Yummm....jingle is really effective. I have been going to Bergen Town Center forever and every time we leave I say that we should try it. Well we finally did. We went about 3 PM on a Saturday afternoon and the place was more or less empty. We were greeted after a minute or so (no one was at the hostess table at the time) and taken to a table. So....the1-2 star portion of my review is for the condition. The floors were sticky the entire walk to the table. The table was sticky and hadn't been wiped ?for the day?, longer? Any place that I hate put my forearms on the table due to stickiness, is a no-no. The server was nice, helpful and patient with us. Kudos to her. They do have mobile stations where you can order food and play games/apps ($1.99 for unlimited app play). Be careful not to let the little ones play with the device, they can order games and apps to their hearts desire and you will get billed. Once you hit a game/app there is one confirmation screen in case you made a mistake, and if you hit yes again, you'll be billed. We left it alone and chose the human server instead. There were larger flat screen TVs around showing the Olympic games which was nice. Now, the 2-3 star portion of my review, the food. Food didn't take long to come. I ordered a massive burger because it looked good and I am glad to say that it was good. The toppings were fresh and adequate. I have to say that it was really satisfying, coming from a chain restaurant. We also had the pizza (blah), shrimp (blah), chicken tenders (semi-blah) and mac and cheese (double-blah). In their defense they do advertise and are probably known best for their burgers, and they should be. If you go, order burgers.... that's about it. Anything else will likely leave you disappointed. Though chicken tenders, fries, nachos, onion rings and other items that most likely come frozen to be thrown into a deep fryer are probably safer bets. I regret my $50 experience but I can say that I tried it. Lesson learned. A plus was that you can pay at the table using the device. No more waiting for the ""check"" which is honestly to me the most dreadful part of eating out. Swipe your card, and a couple of clicks later, you're gone. It even calculates and recommends the different tips that you can choose from, which I know for some is a pain as well. More restaurants should have that option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=20

Since we used the tablet on the table I forgot and I didn't get a receipt that says it.  I ordered a merry moscato punch and my boyfriend got Sam Adams Boston lager. The bartender was extremely friendly, knowledgable, and easy to have a conversation with.  For burgers I ordered a royal robin burger which has an egg on top with bacon and all the works and he got what I believe is called a pig out burger?  I've had the Royal burger before and it's always been good. Don't be fooled by the pig out burgers name it's pretty tiny and lacking a little if you ask me. It was basically a small bacon burger with bacon on it, but it could have just been because my burger was on the larger side. Regardless we split each burger so we could each try some so it worked out to our benefit.  Overall a great experience and I wouldn't hesitate to come back.

Our waitress was very nice and did her best to take care of us and run the bar. We ordered drinks and a few appetizers for the table.  Appetizers were the pretzel bites with cheese dipping sauce and the onion ring tower with 2 different sauces. The onion rings were really good. Nice think cut onions with a really enjoyable crunch factor. The pretzel bites were good as well but nothing to write home about. Would still order them again though.  For my main course I decided on trying the Southern Charm burger. Black Angus patty glazed with brown sugar and topped with candied bacon, honey BBQ sauce (that I got on the side), cheddar cheese and caramelized onions (got frizzled instead) on a toasted ciabatta bun. My burger was good but nothing I would write home about. I really didn't enjoy the ciabatta bun but that was my fault for trying to deviate from the plan. My boyfriend seemed to enjoy his Nacho crunch tavern burger.It's A burger topped with onions, tomatoes, pepper-jack cheese, crunchy tortilla strips and a cheddar cheese sauce made with lime, chile and cool, creamy ranch. I didn't even get to try a bite because he ate it all. One thing that I really enjoyed was my sweet potato fries, those were amazing.  Ill have to come back and try something else on the basic side next time, maybe I'll enjoy it more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=20

However, this Friday was probably the last time I go. My wife ordered the Chicken Ensenada and when it came out the chicken was over cooked and the salad was rancid. We told our server and she explained to the manager. All he did was take the food off the bill. He never came out to apologize and ask if there is anything else they can get you. Even the waitress did not ask. They finally offered a free dessert. I paid the bill and we left without me even eating my food. When a manager cannot make the effort to come out and make sure the customer is satisfied with the service and find out what happened that is just absolutely poor customer service and shows you do not care about your customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=20

Betty L.,"Sunnyside, NY",289,321,1489,1.0,1/2/2015,"Ok, so I have seen Red Robin commercials.  It looked pretty good and we happen to find this one while shopping at the outlets.  My fiancé and I went there for lunch.  I ordered the Mushroom, Swiss burger and he ordered a BBQ Road house burger.  We were excited to try their burgers, and take advantage of their ""unlimited"" steak fries promotion.   We did get our food pretty quickly.  The burgers were meh.  Not memorable at all because it was really greasy.  I know burgers are supposed to be greasy, but this was ridiculous.  I couldn't pick up the burger, because the bottom of the burger was soaking wet and really mushy.  I have eaten a lot of ""gourmet burgers"" but this was just not for me.  I only ate  1/2 of my burger because it was just very odd tasting and I couldn't continue eating.  I ended up just eating their steak fries which were cooked perfectly and not greasy at all.     If you want additional fries order them immediately it's about a 15 minute wait to get them.  They give you very small portions, about 11-12 fries at a time.  I know it sounds crazy but I did count them.   After we got our food our waitress disappeared.  My fiancé wanted extra BBQ sauce for his burger.  We waited for about 15 minutes or so looking for our waitress waiting for her to return.  There were other servers there, but they pretended not to see us.  When our waitress finally re-appeared we asked for extra BBQ sauce, she said ok, but again she disappeared.  At this point we were ready for another soda re-fill.  After 10 minutes we asked a different server for just BBQ sauce they said ok, but they never came back.  This place was not even busy at all.     Our waitress finally re-appeared with a blank look, which was obvious she forgot the sauce.  So we just ordered soda re-fills.  It was obvious she was not on her game, but it's still annoying.  Normally, I can overlook bad service if the food was good, but in this case it was just not for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=20

The pretzel bite appetizer was okay, my bloody mary was obviously a mix, my son's chicken fingers & fries were the same as they would have been at any chain restaurant and my buffalo chicken bites were a bit odd. They were 5 fried chicken morsels arranged over a bed of rippled potato chips with a few celery stalks, about a teaspoon of crumbled blue cheese and a cup of ranch dressing. Chips were soggy, chicken dry and ranch dressing tasteless.   While I don't expect anything spectacular out of this or any other chain, I think they could do better. The restaurant, while visually pleasing, is laid out in a weird fashion with many of the booths placed along a narrow corridor.  Also worth mentioning is that, while the place was less than 10% full, the mens room was in shambles with paper towels strewn about the floor. Granted, there is a sign instructing patrons to alert the staff if it requires cleaning but that should be their job, not mine.  Anyway, if you are looking to eat in a chain restaurant, and let's face it, there are times when we are and do not want to deal with crowds, there is nothing wrong with Red Robin.

They're stocked with a pretty great selection of cocktails and beers on draught. I had an alcoholic version of some kind of strawberry/lemonade drink & really enjoyed its size, flavor, & the edible macerated strawberries. As in any chain restaurant in this genre, don't expect fresh quality vegetables but the burgers themselves were decent as was my bbq chicken burger; I wouldn't say they're worth $10+ each, but they're decent. The onion rings are really good and worth getting for sure.  The all you eat fries concept is what led me to always wanting to try red robin (cue music, yum) but they were pretty disappointing. They give you small quantities as a time and it takes forever to come out (our server was great and gave us two baskets at once which really equaled one normal sized basket).

So, off I went to order myself a Red Robin burger; after all they must *sarcasm* be good if they have the courage to open ANOTHER large, burger focused, restaurant in an already saturated niche... However, to my surprise I was not disappointed! We sat at the bar and ordered two burgers and two beers (they have an alcohol license which is also nice) on the burgers arrived they arrived properly cooked as requested.  They were seasoned very nicely and were nearly comparable to a Zin Burger! (see my other review, or my 'Burgers of Bergen County' list).  The fries were also excellent and I really have no complaints.  This is definitely a very strong four-star restaurant review, if I could give them a 4.5 I would.   Although there are many, many burger restaurants to choose from I can definitely see myself returning to re-visit Red Robbins, to sit at the bar and order another one of those delicious burger and fry combos sometime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=60

They were pretty good with accommodating the seat that we wanted but that's about where the good things ended. After we placed an order, it took over 30mins to receive our 2 burger entrees. Apparently, the table next to us accidentally got our order once they finally realized it 15 mins after they started eating it. And, that table actually asked them if they received the correct order, but without even checking, the server just say ""yes"", but it wasn't. So we had to wait another 15mins for our order to actually arrive. It was nice that they gave us some discount for that inconvenience but we were almost ready to leave if it wasn't for the desperate hunger we were feeling already. I'm pretty sure burgers doesn't take that long to cook. It took us less than half of the wait for us to finish our food. I couldn't wait to leave.

About 5 minutes later some guy, maybe the manager, came out from the closet with a booster that he claimed he found in the kitchen. Weird.

Justin C.,"Washington, DC",60,271,,2.0,4/28/2015,"I love Red Robin. I really do. I have so many great memories of Red Robin which is why it hurts to give this place 2 stars but it really deserves 2 stars. I would give it 1 star but the Red Robin name alone prevents me from doing so. Also, I reserve my 1 star ratings for the absolute WORST of the worst.  So why do I hate this Red Robin? 1) Ambiance - I've been to a lot of Red Robins, but this one by far has the worst ambiance. It seems like there was zero thought put into the arrangement of the furniture or décor. The main area looks way too tight. Even the tables look cheap.  2) Food - Most of my vitriol is for the food. The food quality here simply sucks. Not only have some of my friends gotten sick from the food here, the food just doesn't taste fresh or good! I've been to this location three times (I know I'm an idiot for coming here that many times) and every time, my burgers (I've ordered three different burgers) were really soggy. I feel like even the order of the burger ingredients were off which only adds to the poor quality. Why would you put onion strings at the very bottom of the burger??? We also ordered wings this time, and they looked so old and dead. I expect wings to look fresh and have that orange glow, but these wings looked like they came straight from the fryer and sat out for a long time. I always ask for well-done fries, but even if I don't give special instruction, they should come out fresh and semi-crispy. Here, you tell them ""well-done"" and the fries still come out soggy and not fresh. Major disappointment.  3) Service - If you sit at the bar, you'll get pretty good service but in the other areas, the servers aren't very attentive even when the restaurant is empty.  I only came here a third time btw, cause I had to get my free birthday burger and this is by far the closest Red Robin around. I won't be coming back here again.

Next we ordered salsa and guacamole as an appetizer. The guac and salsa were the smallest portions I have ever seen and extremely salty.   We each ordered a burger and both were luke-warm, boarder line cold on the inside. I got broccoli as a side, requested butter and was told they didn't have any but could provide ranch instead. Since when is ranch a substitute for butter?  The other burger came with sweet potatoes fries which were also cold. After sending both meals back they were replaced with mildly warmer burgers but still not great.  At the end of the meal a nervous man who I assume was the manager on staff came over and repeatedly apologized, however didn't comp anything on the bill.   I would absolutely not return here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=60

When we got there we were seated quickly but understand why the whole row of large booths were available because every time the door opened the cold air would hit you.  The servers were very polite and checked up on us constantly which is remarkable considering it seemed only 4 or 5 of them were working the entire floor.  We made sure when we left to tip them well and I hope everyone else did so as well because they were running around non-stop. As for the food, my wife and I both ordered burgers and it took a ridiculous amount of time for us to get our food.  The server apologized to us and we noticed they were making the same apology over and over again to other patrons.  Again, it seems like they have a staffing issue. When we got our food we were both disappointed because the patties were pretty tasteless and even though we both ordered specialty burgers they were really unimpressive and really missed all marks on taste.   I ordered this burger: Burnin' Love, ""The King would approve of this one. Topped with fried jalapeño coins, tangy salsa, Pepper-Jack, tomatoes and chipotle aioli on a jalapeño-cornmeal kaiser roll. It's love at first bite.""  and had to put ketchup and their signature seasoning to make it tasty despite all of their toppings.  Our fries were also lukewarm, limp and probably could have used another few minutes in the fryer.

Wasted even more of our time when we just wanted to go home and get the hell out of there. Doubt she even processed the refund correctly.

We began with 2 items for the $5 appetizers.   The onion rings were very good and came with ranch sauce and their Campfire sauce.  My wife enjoyed the Campfire sauce with the onion rings.   The second appetizer was the Bar Wings 'b' Yukon Chips - 1/2 order.  I selected the Buzzard sauce for the wings which was described by the waitress to be similar to a Buffalo sauce.  She was right.  The appetizer tasted great but was a questionable value even at $5.  There were only 4 wings!   Red Robin Gourmet has lots of sauces to choose from and are generous with regard to bringing you more etc! Wife's main was the Crispy Arctic Char or Cod.  I have seen both on their online menus and am unsure which one she ate.  She liked the sandwich.  She got the unlimited cole slaw so that we could share. My main was the Burnin' Love burger.  Red Robin Gourmet Burger for some strange reason can't do rare, medium rare, medium etc like the rest of the world.  Instead your options are ""some pink"" or ""no pink"".  Weak.  The burger was very messy.  The actual meat had little to no flavor and is a thinner patty than I prefer.  The sweet potato fries are bottomless.  It is a bit confusing on the menu.  They were very good and I enjoyed dipping them in the Thai chili sauce and the ranch sauce from the onion rings.

The restaurant is well laid out but has some service issues to work out. What I like about this location is no children are allowed in the bar/lounge area, this makes for a nice place to kick back and enjoy the relaxed atmosphere.The service at the bar is excellent at times, food arrives fast (10 min. ticket times), fresh and hot with plates cleared quickly. If your lucky enough to have Kristen as your bartender she's a delight, well trained and efficient with a great knowledge of the menu. Tess is another story, she must have worked at the DMV before with her attitude and slow indifferent service. When patrons sit at your bar you get them a drink first and then go back to your service bar, minus 1 star from my previous rating of four. Families are welcome to eat in the dining room that is partitioned off from the bar so this is a huge plus for me, in the bar they play decent music at a comfortable level and have a few large TV's tuned to sporting events. Thanks to John the corporate trainer and Junior our server, awesome show great job!  The pricing is reasonable, food above average, most of the staff well trained and management professional, If your already a fan of Red Robin you will not be disappointed. if you have never tried this chain I suggest you do, this particular location stands out from the others in the area thanks to it's addition of a 21+ bar area and a more interesting ambiance than your typical Red Robin or other burger themed restaurants for that matter.

Tim M.,"Hawthorne, NJ",0,1,,1.0,11/12/2016,"I wish I could comment on the food, but quite frankly, we were never served. It was a Friday night and a small group from work decided to go to Red Robin. The second we walked in we were greeted by careless workers and the empty promise that our waiter would be here shortly. It was fairly empty in the restaurant and the lighting was uncomfortably bright. We sat at our table for nearly 30 minutes and no one served us. Now I would understand it if was packed but it wasn't. Workers walked by us and just ignored us. It didn't feel good being ignored. And we were also starving. After 30 minutes of nothing, we decided to leave.

Anyway - I sat at the bar. Split a bacon cheeseburger with my husband which was cooked exactly how we asked for it; medium with crispy bacon. This came with a side of never ending fries which were f'ing delicious. They are topped with some sort of seasoning salt that makes you want to stuff your face with them. And then the dipping sauces too....really good. We had one that tasted like thousand island dressing and another that was similar to buffalo sauce.  The bartender was helpful and attentive.

The French onion soup was horrid. Returned the soup. Burgers came next nothing great for $14 a burger. Bottomless fries means nothing because the waitress came by once and forgot to bring more fries.

They are very nice and prompt with everything, and your food it ready no longer than 10 mins so if you are looking for a quick grab then this is your place. Their fried onion rings, or the fries are just very flavorful and they make them very fresh. The burgers tho are probably the best part of this placex their whiskey river bbq chicken or the teryiaki chicken are really the home runners. The buns are are really good and you can chose from different varieties of buns even the ramen noodle bun which is basically ramen noodles made into a bun which is quite filling.

Actually the scale I'm using for this particular location is McDonalds customer service and even then it fails. Food isn't bad, it's just the people that make the place miserable.  Don't bother coming to Red Robin unless you're looking for an example of how inept a group of people can be. You ever wonder what it would be like if the DMV decided to open up a restaurant? Here you have it. If the DMV did run the place, Patricia the hostess would make a great general manager. She has DMV written all over.  On the plus side, the following song makes sitting waiting an hour at your table for a burger a lot more fun: As the snow flies On a cold and gray Red Robin mornin' A poor little baby child is born In the ghetto And his mama cries 'cause if there's one thing that she don't need it's another hungry mouth to feed In the ghetto Update: Customer Service for Red Robin reached out to discuss this.

They served them no pink or a little pink, because apparently, their general clientele has difficulty with the range from rare to well done.

FilthyMcNasty X.,"Hackensack, NJ",3,116,135,3.0,5/7/2017,"We visited this location for lunch during a rainy day, more like a torrential downpour. Upon exiting our car and approaching the entrance, I noticed an employee in their bright red shirt leaning against the building wall having a cigarette. My first impression was not a favorable one. I don't care if a person smokes, but employees shouldn't be hanging out in front of the building looking like they have nothing better to do. We received a nice greeting from the manager and another employee. The place was empty for lunch, probably due to the weather. We were seated and then greeted by the gentleman who was smoking out front, and smelled like smoke. Not a pleasant smell. We ordered ""gourmet"" burgers, onion rings and sweet potato fries. The meal came quickly. That alarms me, but the place was empty. I ordered the A.1. Peppercorn burger. It was good, just good. Worthy of a ""gourmet"" title? No. It wasn't worthy of the $11.89 price, either. For that price, the sweet potato fries shouldn't have cost me an additional $1.49. I thought $2.99 for my friend's soda was pretty steep. I don't drink soda, so I don't know if it is. I drink water. My friend liked her BBQ burger. Her onion rings were good. This was my first visit to a Red Robin. No compelling reason to come back when Habit Burger is closer to home, better and cheaper. There is a little kiosk on every table that allows you to pay your bill, play games and watch their advertising. The trivia game was on while we dined. We jumped in the game while we waited for the rain to let up. An additional $1.99 appeared on my bill for ""Entertainment"". It turns out that you have to pay to play. It doesn't tell you before you jump in the game. We were told by the manager that it is mentioned on the first splash screen that appears after you are seated. We didn't see it. All we saw was a game in progress, so we played. The charge was removed from my bill. The kiosk is convenient for paying your bill, as you don't have to wait around for your server to bring it to you. The receipt is printed for you, too. Overall, the experience was just okay, nothing special. Gourmet? No. Just a fancy marketing title. The better option is a cheaper Tavern burger for $6.99.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=40

I didn't know it was mainly known for burgers and thats a big reason why i give it only 2 stars because i believe there are so many more spots for a good delicious burger. I had ordered the guacamole bacon burger. I had asked for no bacon though and instead of swiss cheese can i have mozzarella. I had also order a milkshake to come out with my meal. The onion rings were good as an appetizer but then my burger came out. First they didn't add any guacamole so when i had told them it was missing they just gave me a side in a cup. Second i had to search the entire burger to see if there was even any cheese on it. There was barely any. While im eating my whole burger falls apart. The bread was just in pieces. I didn't really enjoy eating it with it being such a mess. They never brought out my milkshake until i had to remind them at the end. So i dont think this will be a place i will be returning whenever im craving a burger.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=100
Joey P.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",81,125,68,2.0,4/15/2014,"Only ate at this location once and it was super early in the afternoon on a weekday when they first opened up a few months ago, there was an abundance of servers and literally maybe only one or two other tables with guests besides us. It took a while to get our drinks after we were asked if we ever ate red robin speech.  Shake was good, burgers were sub par compared to other red robin locations I've tried and waitress was slow and there was no reason for it being it was so dead. If there was a more local RR i would definitely go to it but the other semi local one is out of the way.

Joni S.,"Naples, FL",74,22,,1.0,10/11/2014,"First time visit and what a disaster!  My husband and I were seated in the bar--we were not given a choice although the place was fairly empty. 3 TVs with 3 different games with sound on in a small area.  Yipes! We gave our order--when we requested water, we were asked ""sparkling or bottled""? Once we asked for tap water, however, it was given.  Our order was taken quickly--four items--a cheeseburger with side of coleslaw, a blue cheeseburger with side of salad. When it was brought to the table, three out of the four items were wrong! I thought, perhaps, it was someone else's order. My husband got fries instead of salad, but he said he'd keep it. They took back my burger and the fries I didn't order and said they'd have to make new ones. It was twenty minutes before my correct order was brought to the table by the Manager. He was very apologetic and said he would not charge me for my meal.  Of course, by that time, my husband had finished his burger and fries. Definitely would not go back again. Something is way wrong with how orders are taken and filled.

The kids meals are a good value and the sweet potato fries are yummy. But the kitchen and management does not have its act together.  Each time we have waited 30 minutes or more for our food. One time the kids meals came in about 15 minutes and then we waited another 20 minutes for our food. Today we waited 35 minutes before anything came out and one of our orders took another 15 minutes because the server forgot to put it in (according to the manager, who threw the server under the bus right away).

Geoffrey C.,"Northvale, NJ",114,64,141,2.0,1/4/2014,"The Bergen County burger craze continues, this time I thought that Red Robin was smart in their location, offering an alternative to Bobby Flay's Burger Palace within, albeit an outdoor walk to, the Bergen Town Center. I've been to the Clifton location on several occasions and always enjoyed my experience there, so I expected the same good vibes this time around. It had been open for a few weeks already, so already I was going to give them the benefit of the doubt when it came to service. Turned out that service wasn't the problem, the food was. I ordered a Royal Red Robin, with all of its fried egg goodness, and a half order of onion rings. The half order was a new thing for me and was the perfect portion size for my wife and I. My wife had a burger as well, but she couldn't recall which one... What we could recall, however, was the extreme heartburn and accompanying headache that ravaged us for the rest of the night. This was a shame, because I enjoyed eating the burger, it tasted delicious while consuming it, the egg in the Royal Red Robin was cooked perfectly, and the onion rings and it's sauce were crispy and satisfactory.  While the service and friendliness of the staff flourished on what was a busy night, it was surprisingly the food and the effects it had to both of us that failed here.  It affected us so much so, that we swore this place off for the time being. Lucky for Red Robin, my craving for burgers trumps any type of bad memories, so I wouldn't be surprised if I give Red Robin a second chance...hopefully an updated review will follow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=100

She'd go around asking if other tables if they wanted refills on their freckled lemonade or fries and would BLATANTLY ignore us. Like I've never felt so disrespected while dining at a restaurant before. What the hell did I even do to you?!?!  We always smile and say yes please, and thank you...

George Leroy T.,"Hackensack, NJ",3,5,,4.0,9/25/2015,"We started coming here when it first opened.  We were driving by and saw it.  When we first started coming, we loved it.   It has the usual chain elements of cute pictures and art work. There are flat panel TVs ala sports bar motiff.  We have found the servers to be very eager to please and remember you if you are a regular.  We love Kate, Roxy and Deanna.  The managers are there to make sure you are happy.  Very good selection of burgers and Brews.  We love the Chophouse burger. It has a great bun to meat to condiment ratio.  You can get your burger to order if you don't quite like whats on a particular burger.  We like the fries and salads, which are unlimited. Nice!   Seafood Scatter is very good too.  OK this is all the good points.  We have some complaints too.  As mentioned in other reviews, many families bring young children and they can be loud or disruptive to people who want a quiet meal.  The managers are very agreeable and will move you if you aren't happy. Same if you don't like the way something is prepared. (We have found inconsistencies in preparation )  If you are polite and don't act like an idiot, most restaurants are happy to give you what you want.  I don't understand why people don't speak up if they aren't happy with something.  They just gripe in the review.   What we have mentioned but can't get changed: We have noticed that the company has changed many things that we really liked.  We used to LOVE the salads. They were made just right, had croutons and I can't explain why, just tasted great.  They changed that to little square bowls and no croutons and they just aren't as good.  While the Mac and Cheese is still good, they started putting it in the little square bowls as well. The servings are much smaller.  When we mentioned this, we got a ""Change is good"" response.  Obviously, these are corporate decisions and the managers just have to go along with it.  While you do get unlimited refills on the salads and such, they just aren't as good.  Fries are still good.

Dan L.,"Closter, NJ",40,5,,1.0,2/11/2014,"This was our first time at this Red Robins location. There were several things wrong that happened that night that makes me never want to go again. First... Our waitress took our order and she didn't articulate how the sauces work. We were hoping to order some, but we wanted to avoid any charges. But she didn't specify which sauces would charge us and just looked at us ""dumbly."" Second... Our food took forever to come out. I think that's the longest I've ever waited for food. Third... The store itself is very cramped. My friends and I felt that we had to squeeze through tables and really try to avoid people just to get to the restroom. What a hassle... Fourth... The waitress put in my friend's order wrong. He wanted his burger without cheese but they put it in so he asked to take it back. It's an error anyone can make so that's not the actual problem. The REAL problem was it took them about another 30-40 minutes just to bring back a new order for my friend. As we saw other orders passing us by repeatedly. Fifth... One of the biggest attractions of Red Robins is the ""unlimited fries."" But they were rather slow with bringing it out. I think our table of 5 asked for more fries about 6 times and we only received fries 3 times (with about 15 minutes wait each time). Sixth... Our waitress brought over the wrong sauces...cmon!! Seventh... Our waitress sent over the manager in her stead at one point because she must have been nervous about messing up our order so many times. The manger did express concern, but I personally felt it was rude she couldn't come approach us herself or even apologize herself. Eighth... They charged us twice for the burger they messed up for my friend. I looked at the bill (and yes the manager compensated us $40) and in essence we were charged for a burger we never even touched. No restaurant I've ever been to ever does that. At the end after several complaints, the manger crumpled up our bill and said we could go. He did apologize too. At least that was on point..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=120
Jane C.,"New York, NY",50,85,45,3.0,11/1/2013,"I'm only giving it three stars because I've been to other locations and I actually like it at other places, but the one that just opened up at the Bergen Town Centre is really not p to par with the rest. I am hoping that it gets better with time.. I usually try to avoid going to places as soon as they open up.  The service is probably the first thing I would say needs to be improved. EVERYONE is slow here, so I can only assume that maybe they are all inexperienced. The hostesses are friendly and enthusiastic, but the waiters definitely do not seem happy to be there. And again, they are slow.   The food didn't seem to be what I remember from the other locations I've been to (one near the Poconos, PA and the other being in Woodbridge). I ordered Keep it Simple burger with avocados, meat with a little pink in it and steak fries. The burger was very dry, with 3 baby slices of avocado in a condiment cup, 3 slices of pickle, and 3 baby rings of red onion. The steak fries, which usually come in a basket, were given in a small metal ring. I guess it doesnt matter that much since they are bottomless anyway, but who knows how long it would have taken if i had wanted more fries.  Most of my coworkers seemed to like their food though, and their onions rings were actually really good with the right amount of crispy batter. Their mini dogs (I forget the official name) were way too salty - i think the sausage in general was saltier than preferred.  Guess I can't expect a whole lot from a chain restaurant, but I really liked Red Robin until i came to this one. Will go back some time later to see if they've improved.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=120
Lakeshia B.,"Silver Spring, MD",365,128,13,3.0,11/5/2013,"Finally I get to sit down and write a lovely review for Red Robin...yyyuummm!!!...who has not heard the catchy jingle on television as burgers, salads, fries, and dipping sauces parade on the screen. I finally got up the nerve to come here since I had never had Red Robin before in my life. I have gone a total of three times and as they say three times is the charm. My first trip here I was served by the lovely Tess at the bar. She took my order after she was finished getting down drink orders for the rest of the bar and the restaurant. I ordered the cup of clam chowder and the Red Robin Royal which came out charred on the bottom, fries less than hot and crispy, but  hey at least my apple martini was good. My second trip, I decided to order a Whiskey BBQ burger add to that bacon, egg, and take away the tomato. The same problem as before but this time they left off the darn barbecue sauce. I decided not to complain because well I was enjoying a great meal with a few minor setbacks. Finally, on my most recent trip which was this past Friday they got it right. Ordered another Whiskey BBQ burger (didn't put on as much and only asked the tomato be removed), got a side of thai chili sauce for dipping my fries, and when it came to me it was ordered and served perfectly. The burger was nice and juicy with some pink in the middle and the fries were cooked to perfection.  So what are the pros of this place? Well if there is one thing I cannot get enough of is the fact that their restaurant and presentation of their food is flawless. I know I have had some problems with my order being made properly, but I hate when I expect to get a great juicy burger topped high with great toppings and instead could have opted for McDonald's and their cheap take on a burger. You do not get this with Red Robin, you get exactly what they advertise and what they sell. The exterior and interior are clean. Cannot stand a dirty place to eat and they always greet and say good bye with a smile on their face (even if they are dead tired).  And the prices are not half bad. For a cup of clam chowder, Red Robin Royal burger, and a good drink I don't recall paying over $30.00. And their happy hour is Monday through Friday from 3-6 pm and from 8 pm to close.  The cons: Well you can read my two previous visits and the mere fact that one time ordered an apple martini and instead of being green and having some kick to it. Heck I got totally opposite of that SMDH But if you at least give it try you will not be disappointed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=120

By the way I'd give them 2.5 stars if I could. It certainly wasn't terrible. When we arrived they sat a table of 5 in the bar. Not sure why they would think that a bunch of people in their 40's and 50's would like to be in a very noisy bar during a football game but I digress.  Our waitress informed us that she was 18 and new and never had a waitress job before. When I ordered my burger she informed me that ""medium well"" was the rarest they cook burgers there... really? So after she leaves i go to the front desk where 4 employees are standing around doing nothing. I ask them and none of them have any idea if that is true. ""we aren't waitresses, sorry"" they say.  I ask for the manager and he comes over and thanks me for alerting him, as although they do have a minimum temperature they cook to, he assures me their burgers come out pink on the inside. He has no idea why our waitress told us medium well. Turned out that is what her trainers told her to say. The manager was at a loss. Food came out... it was meh... tasted like a good burger I'd have made myself on the grill outside, nothing special. Some things were not cooked properly but not terrible. When we got our food we realized that there was no salt, pepper or ketchup on the table. When the ""bottomless fries"" came out on one of our plates there was about 12 french fries. When we asked for more... they never came. Then to apologize for never bringing them two different people brought us more even though we were already leaving. We sat waiting for things for entirely too long. This was not the waitresses fault, she was very sweet and attentive albeit not very experienced. But the runners just didn't do their job very well. There is more but I'll not bore you.  The menu is interesting and some nice ideas but I'm not going back to a burger joint that won't cook me a med rare burger, pink inside or not, especially with Zin Burger about 1 mile away, who's Kobe burger is hands down the best burger I've ever eaten.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=120

However, this time was another story. Our waitress switched tables after taking our drink order and a new waitress came along... Literally staring at us blankly as if we knew that our waitresses had switched. When I places my gluten free order she said let me get my manager to confirm any allergy orders. When the manager came over... He was utterly clueless  as to what was safe on their gluten free menu... Which in my opinion is not a good look if you are supposed to be ensuring that your food is gluten safe.  He said he was going to check that the avocado bacon burger wrapped in lettuce was OK to eat....and he never retuned to confirm my order. Then when my order FINALLY came out... It did not have all the Fresh vegetables that were supposed to be on top& it was on a gluten free bun that was so freezer burned that I just pushed it to the side.   They did not ensure the safety of my allergy because I was sick halfway through my meal, meaning that there was a lack of care with cross contamination in the kitchen.

Jess P.,"Secaucus, NJ",288,248,9,3.0,3/31/2014,"I've been to this Red Robin location about three times now. First two times, I've tried their burgers (tip: get the burger with the fried egg on top, I think it's called the Royal Robin. SO GOOD, the egg makes a delicious difference) and the last time I was here I opted to try their buffalo chicken tenders (surprisingly they were good. The buffalo sauce was not overpowering and they did not make the tenders soggy, I would probably order this again if I'm not craving a burger).  They have consistently good food here. The bottomless fries are a great deal. The fries are seasoned well and paired with one of their many sauces (the Thai chili is a personal favorite) you really can't go wrong. Another thing that they do well here are their drinks. Something that I was skeptical to try but ended up really liking was their blue moon milkshake. Yes, it's a beer/milkshake combo but it works. They really emphasize the orange flavor and it just tastes good. You get a hint of beer and even though it beer and dairy don't sound like the greatest combination believe me when I say that the blue moon shake here is really, really good.  The one thing that is hit or miss about this location is the service. The first time I went here the service was AMAZING. Our waiter was really attentive and he constantly was checking up on us and even gave us free sauces because we had mentioned we liked them so much. We didn't need to look around and search for him when we needed something. It was great. The second time, the service was okay. Not as great at the first time, but it also wasn't terrible. The most recent time I was here, the service wasn't great. We had to wait a while to get water refills and when we wanted either refills on fries or something, the waiter was nowhere to be found. Now, I've only eaten in the bar area, not in the family-oriented side, so I don't know if it's just where I'm sitting that makes the service not great. I understand if the restaurant is busy, it's harder to get to everyone and see what they need, but the last time I came here, it was not terribly busy. Maybe I'm being nit-picky, I don't know. They lose a star because service can either be good or bad. I will definitely be back at Red Robin. The prices are decent and the food is good. The mediocre service isn't all that fun, but in this case, the good outweighs the bad and let's be honest, they had me at ""bottomless fries.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=140

J D.,"Westwood, NJ",0,6,3,3.0,8/20/2014,"I used to go to the Red Robin location in Clifton with my fiance and we both enjoyed the food and the service.  This new location still has some catching up to do.  We came here on a weekday night when the restaurant wasn't crowded.  The first thing that we noticed was how SMALL the restaurant was compared to Clifton.  The restaurant looked cramped compared to the wide open space at the other location.   We then followed the hostess to our table and our waitress and waitress trainee quickly came to our table.  The service was a little bit off but this was mostly due to them being new to the position and experiencing a lot of growing pains.  She forgot one of the drink orders and for one of the burgers we requested no tomatoes, but that was forgotten also.  I'm sure the others in the waitstaff are fine. My major problem is the quality of the food.  The amount of fries you get with your burger is minute, no more than a hand full.  Granted, yes, it is bottomless but I could imagine how annoying it would be to keep having to refill. The burgers that we cooked we very raw after we asked for medium well.  Whenever I took a bite out of the burger, i kept having to wipe off the blood and oil from my mouth.

John P. delivered my burger with the jalapeno pepper on top of the bun. My thought was a long the lines of...uhm..ok. I cut up the pepper and added it to the sandwich. It was a good tasting burger.

This is the only Red Robin I have been to so I can't compare it to other specimens of this chain, but  I can say that a lot of the criticism is quite accurate.

We usually wait about 45 minutes to get our order.  The French Fries are soggy unless you ask for Extra-well done fries. In cold weather, you do have to be careful where you sit because a lot of the tables near the doors get big drafts of cold air when the doors open  Why do I give it 3 stars? Because the burgers are quite good and good value.  The most recent DGB was quite tasty.  I also enjoy the patty melt and the all-American The bar is great with ample beer and cocktails for reasonable prices.  Compared to the low-end burger joints and BBP this place is civilized.

Hugh S.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",0,4,,1.0,6/12/2014,"Tonight my family and I went to Red Robin  at the Bergen Town Center.  In one word atrocious.  I always leave a tip.  Tonight I did not.  Our experience began pleasant enough but quickly disintegrated into a nightmare.  First off it took for ever to receive our food.  My meal, the seafood scatter came out before a long wait.  Of course my soup appetizer never came out, until i mentioned this to a server.  The server who brought me my entree was someone else.  That's not what upset me.  I mentioned that our party still didn't receive our soups.  She abruptly walked away and stated something to the effect that she would check.  She didn't.  I observed her proceed to another table and begin clearing it.  Meanwhile my other family members hadn't even received their meals yet.  This server walked past my table several minutes later and I mentioned that she never came back with an answer or food.  She responded with a snippy attitude and response.  That pretty much set the tone for the remainder of our stay.  I received my soups after my meal was served.  Eventually the rest of my party received their food.  My wife complained that her Fish and chips dinner was unseasoned, bland, tasteless.  My stepson received french onion soup that was inedible.  It's as if someone took the salt shaker and dumped it in the pot.  My meal was Ok, but inconsistent. I piece of fish was also unseasoned and the other was heavily salted.  At some point, after I complained about the server the manager stated that she comped my chowder.  Throughout the meal, service was slow and inattentive.  We requested a refill on the bottomless steak fries.  It never arrived.  Our original waitress was apologetic but unable to resolve that issue.  She kept referring to everyone as ""honey"".  I normally keep my mouth shut, but I pretty much had enough and brought that to her attention.  Overall the experience was miserable and a huge waste of money and time. ***I completed an on-line customer service questionnaire.  For the sake of complete honesty, I just received a phone call from the store manager apologizing for my experience.  Based on his call, I will try this store again, but in the future.  I need to calm down and allow time for Red Robin to correct the obvious service and food preparation issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=160
Monica F.,"Bergenfield, NJ",0,3,,2.0,11/17/2013,"I walked in with my boyfriend and the hostesses were too busy talking to greet us. We stood awkwardly until they were done talking. Our waitress was friendly and took our orders promptly. The drinks were fantastic. We were seated next to the computer where they enter meals. Our waitress was sorting utensils there at this computer and proceeded to drop a fork on my back without noticing.  Then we received our food - the waitress mixed up multiple parts of our burger order. We ate the food anyway, which was decent for being different than what we wanted.  Overall food was good but service is lacking. They need to have less staff that works more often so they learn how to do their job (since majority of staff has never been a hostess or waitress before.) I will come back in a few months and hopefully the staff will be more experienced with their job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=160
Diane W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,5,,2.0,12/13/2014,"I am being generous giving this place 2 stars.  The only reason I am doing that is because the food was acceptable.  When I arrived, the hostess really didnt acknowledge us.  I really wasn't even sure that she went to find us a table, until she came back a few minutes later.  I asked the manager for a copy of their gluten free options, and he said that it was online only and that it was store policy.  He was definitely a bit defensive about it.  Our server was a bit better at first, she made the manager bring over a tablet so that I could look at the gluten free options online.  But after that, her performance went from concerned and conscientious to perfunctory at best.  The food was hot and as far as taste goes, it was okay.  As a first time guest to New Jersey, it wasn't anything to write home about.  What could've turned this review around was the staff, but nope, they tanked it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=160
Nellie F.,"Englewood, NJ",0,27,21,2.0,5/25/2014,"I went to the Red Robin based upon my experience eating at this restaurant in another state - first time eating here in NJ. My family and I entered after 9pm into the very small waiting area, it was packed but when we were seated about 10 minutes later there were many tables empty. I was confused as to why we waited. We were seated and then had to wait about 6-7 minutes before the manager stopped by to see if we were attended to we advised no and mentioned the waiter would be with us shortly.....about 3 minutes later the waiter showed up, extremely happy acting like we had not been waiting for almost 10 minutes. We ordered appetizers and it arrived, we then had to ask for silverware since none was on our table when we were seated. I then ordered a favored lemonade drink and my wife ordered a berry drink, since the menu did not really give a good description of the drinks we later found out that we had been drinking each others drinks (they place the drinks on the table in front of the wrong people). Since it was bottomless drinks we asked for refills of a different similar drink, the waiter brought the same drinks we did not like (thus the reason for asking for something different). I am very skeptical if I will ever eat at this restaurant/location again. I can understand some mistakes if the place was packed but it was only about 60% full. And after all of that the food was decent, nothing awesome or grand about it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=160
L.G. R.,"Little Ferry, NJ",0,2,,2.0,10/21/2014,"We just left that restaurant, and we will never come back. We had to wait forever and the burger they served to my husband, no even the hungriest dog in my neighborhood could eat it. Very disappointed. The manager ( if there is one there ) should stop the party that was going on in the kitchen  and make them offer better services.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=160
Calvin P.,"Paramus, NJ",154,3,2,2.0,8/3/2014,"The service was absolutely horrible. Very slow with everything. After waiting a long time for the food to come out, I wasn't even satisfied with the food. The cheese in the macaroni and cheese was not fully melted and was not as good as I expected. The riblets were dry and not that great. When my food came out it wasn't even hot anymore and it was so slow i had already lost my appetite. At least they offered dessert on them because of their poor service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=160
Jerry D.,"Paramus, NJ",0,3,,1.0,10/18/2014,My wife and a second couple went on a Fri. night. We were told it would be 1/2 hour wait which but we were pleasantly supprised to be seated ten min. later. However that is where it ended. We were seated at a table and a waiter carrying a tray of drinks spilled the drinks on the women. We were moved to a booth and a very nice waitress took our order. The drinks came out wrong and the women had to send their's back because they were rely horrible. The food took 35 min. to get to us and the burgers were cold and the fries were stale. I must say I was so very disappointed. I can say that I will never return there,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=160
Kristen A.,"New York, NY",3,38,10,1.0,10/11/2014,"I love red Robin and have been to several locations. I sat at the bar (I was the only one at the bar) on a non-busy weekday afternoon. The bartender did not greet me initially.  I even stared at him while he was fulfilling other drink orders that came through after I had been there. He finally came over with a menu and smiled like everything was all good. I knew what I wanted, so I immediately ordered.  I ordered a margarita, fish and chips and clam chowder. You would think if you're sitting at the bar... the only one sitting at the bar... that your drink would come quickly. It did not. He put in my order, then made other drinks.  This was a heavy set bartender who also had his son sitting at one of the booths on the side. His son came in after me and got his meal and milkshake before I even got my margarita. A margarita... ice, tequila, lime juice.. no blender, no extra ingredients, nothing complicated.  The thing that got to me was, the bartender kept smiling at me like everything was all good.  The food was good.. but being the only customer at the bar and having to wait like this while watching him make at least 8 other drinks is crazy. Another female waitress/bartender came in too and never acknowledged me or looked my way as I sat looking incredibly annoyed. I've been a waitress before, so I am extra patient and understand how things work in the business. But there was no reason for this. It was NOT busy and he wasn't training. I hate to pull the race card, but it was either a racial thing or they were just the dumbest restaurant staff on earth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=180
Cat T.,"Bronx, NY",28,1,,1.0,9/6/2014,Went last night and the service was horrible! Hostess was unfriendly.. I felt ignored bc it took a while after he went back and fourth to write my name down. Didn't even say welcome to Red Robin! At first waiter was nice took about 35 minutes for my food to come. Not once did he come to our table to apologize for the delay.  Food came by another server and I didn't have any utensils to eat it with. Waited for waiter who took long and then got the nerve to catch attitude bc I was upset that I didn't have any utensils!!!  Mind you I waited for about 10 minutes before I ate bc I was waiting to ask for the utensils!  But he sure gave me the check really fast!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=180
R M.,"Teaneck, NJ",0,1,,1.0,2/19/2014,Terrible experience. It took over 30 minutes to get our dinner. When we finally did my order was wrong twice!

David M.,"Wyckoff, NJ",1,36,,2.0,10/20/2013,"They are definitely going through some opening issues. Arrived at 6:26 pm. We're told the wait would be 30 min. Well 55 minutes later our table was finally ready. Ordered our drinks and appetizers and the appetizers beat out the drinks. There was a delay with two of the drinks and they did take them off the bill. It was the manger who made that decision on her own. Without us saying anything about. Then we waited close to an hour for our dinner. They ask if you want a little pink or no pink in your burger. Well we all asked for a little pink but that did not happen. None of them had any pink. But we do not like to send back food so we ate them. Also the kids ordered dishes that had riblets in them. There needs to be a mention of how spicy they are as neither of the kids, age 9 and 12 could eat them. They told us after the meal you can request less spicy, but there was no mention of this in the menu. The restaurant also appears very small with a bit of a strange layout. It is going to take some time to work out the kinks. Having been in Red Robins in other areas, this one does not measure up yet. Hopefully it is just new opening headaches and will get better, but it really has a long way to go.  I must say though that the staff was going out of there in the dining room to try and help as they were aware of all of all the issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=180
Steph H.,"Paramus, NJ",0,2,,1.0,7/20/2014,"The last time I went which was the first time I went, the food was phenomenal, service was great but going back today it changed my entire perspective.  It took an estimated 30-35 minutes for two burgers to get to our table and of course mine was burnt.  Would have asked for another one but I wasn't about to wait another 30 minutes for them to remake my burger.  The service was terrible, after our waiter ""Sean"" took our order, he came back to our table one time and asked ""You like it?"" to me then ""You too?"" to my boyfriend.  Didn't see him back at our table again.  He had three other tables and was sitting and talking to other co-workers as well as stayed on his phone.  No, it was not terribly busy but pay attention to your customers!!!  Last but not least there was a blonde waitress/hostess sitting at the table behind us and talking about other customers while we were there, very unprofessional.  Usually I am understanding with ""not great"" service considering my family is in restaurant business as well but I will not be returning to Red Robin, at least not the one in Paramus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=180
