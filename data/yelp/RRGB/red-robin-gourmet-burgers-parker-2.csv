Dave C.,"Denver, CO",733,442,892,4.0,7/28/2017,"No joke, the Parker Red Robin is one of my go-to restaurants. We love the burgers and fries here (which are the same at any Red Robin), BUT the thing that keeps us coming back is the quality of service here.  Every time we go, we have a great experience with our servers. They magically appear out of nowhere to refill our drinks, offer us fries before our burgers arrive, and are generally upbeat all night. On a percentage basis, I've given some of the biggest tips I've ever given in life here. One of the many challenges of running a restaurant in the burbs is that there can be a LOT of kids that come through here. As a result, sometimes parts of the restaurant aren't as clean as you'd want or expect them to be. Usually, the team here will sit you in a cleaner area if some madness went down, but it kind of comes with the territory of burb life.  Fun fact: The veggie burger here is one of the better veg burgers that you'll have anywhere. They'll let you customize a burger to the point that it's almost unrecognizable, which is awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-parker-2
Craig P.,"Denver, CO",1,360,617,1.0,1/7/2018,"I rarely give 1-Star rating. This experience, however, deserves the mark. We frequent and enjoy Red Robin. Their burgers are typically good and we love the fries. During this particular visit it all fell apart. First, I currently have some strict dietary restrictions. As it has it, RR has the Wedgie Burger which doesn't have gluten, egg, or dairy. Or at least it isn't suppose to have any of those things. So I ordered it and it came with a huge glob of mayonnaise. Instead of the server taking it back she argued with me that it is supposed to come with mayo. After much debate she gave me the, ""fine, I'll go ask my manager"" speech. She then came back 8 minutes later (my family was already done eating) and said, ""I guess you were right, it isn't supposed to have mayo. What would you like me to do about it?"" So that didn't make things feel very apologetic or accommodating. So I asked for a newly made Wedgie Burger. She went back and put the order in meanwhile my family was done eating. While I was waiting for the new Wedgie Burger to come to the table the same server spilled a tray of 8 drinks all over the people sitting at the table next to us. She basically freaked out and left the scene. She came back a couple minutes later with a handful of napkins and started helping to clean up people shirts, shoes, and the table. After a minor attempt to clean up she left. 12 minutes later my burger came with no acknowledgment of the mix up. Meanwhile, the family next to us got up and left the restaurant. When they left three employees and the manager moved the tables around while splashing through the 1/2 inch of soda, tea, and water on the ground. No one ever cleaned up the floor or put a sign out. People with their kids where slipping and sliding all over the floor trying to get to the bathroom and back. It was a total mess and a very UNSAFE situation. The restaurant wasn't even all that busy. It just came down to non-caring and inept staff and management. Honestly, they are lucky that no one fell or that I didn't break out into an allergic reaction. Overall it was a VERY stressful and unacceptable experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-parker-2
Amanda W.,"Elizabeth, CO",0,1,,1.0,1/13/2018,"My family and I ate at this restaurant in early January.  Our credit card was charged twice. Upon realizing this, my husband called the restaurant and asked to speak to a manager and he was put on hold for thirty minutes. My husband called back a couple days later and spoke with a manager by the name of Steve. Steve said he would do some research and call back later that day. Steve called backed not the same day but two days later and told my husband there was no evidence of this double transaction. My husband printed off the statement from our credit card showing clearly that the card was charged the exact amount on the same day at the same time two times. He took this to the restaurant where he was told in a very condescending manner that there was nothing that could be done. Will not dine at this establishment ever again. I never write reviews but this was ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-parker-2
Anthony C.,"Aurora, CO",84,7,,1.0,1/8/2018,"I am leaving this review here because the last time I sent it to corporate it fell on deaf ears.  If you are considering this place over the one by Park Meadows, go with the one by Park Meadows.  This is the second time we have gone to this establishment and hoped that this time would be better then the last.  The place was still as dirty as before and the staff wasn't very helpful and hard to find when we needed assistance.  If there is one thing I remember from my time as a server years ago is, if you are going to talk bad about the customers do it when they have already left and aren't within ear shot.  There may have been a mix up in the kitchen and yes we may not have noticed until we had already started eating the food, but forgive me for not noticing a difference when no matter what you order it all tastes the same.  We only asked for 1 burger to be replaced and not all 3 like we should have since it was your kitchen that messed up, but when we asked for a replacement burger we were met with disdain.  Also my child did get sick and throw up on the floor and we apologized and let the wait staff know, and all the waitress do is come over with a rag and said ""Here.""  I am aware that it may have been my child that made the mess and yes we were wanting to clean it up, but don't come at us with attitude and then walk away because at the end of the day we don't work there and it is your job to clean up any messes regardless of who made them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-parker-2
Cliff J.,"Aurora, CO",32,9,1,1.0,6/17/2017,"1 star is not a normal visit for us at this Red Robin but this visit was so so bad. Pamala was our server only by title not by action.  The Manager did end up coming over to try and make things ""right"" but at that point, damage was already done. While speaking with the manager, Pamela interrupted us to put in her two-cents. The manager had to ask her to stop.  This Red Robin has become our stand-by if we don't know what to do for dinner or spur of the moment want to go out. That most certainly will change due the the audacity of this ""server"".  With that said, James who is a server we have had several times, recognized us and came over to greet us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-parker-2
Michael S.,"Denver, CO",0,12,1,1.0,12/20/2017,The food was made wrong. I sent it back and it came back in record time with no changes to the food. The chicken teriyaki should have teriyaki on it and smothered in it. Mine only had an excessive amount of mayonnaise. It's not chicken mayo sandwich.  This is there signature sandwich. The cook said they had new staff which is not a good excuse. I will not come back. The service got worse as they tried to ignore us. It's very disappointing because I eat that sandwich every time I go.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-parker-2
Morgan M.,"Denver, CO",182,251,2071,3.0,9/24/2016,"I have always been a big fan of Red Robin and this is the one I usually go to, but I have been going less and less due to the unsatisfactory food. This recent time it was an okay meal but the service is scaring me away from this location.  My reason for dropping them from 4 stars to 3 stars comes from our experience the other night. It was my dads birthday, the waiter was friendly when he got us drinks but then failed to come back to our table for 15 minutes to get our orders. When he came back I don't know what happened but he was in a real pissy mood. I pointed to the back of the menu and asked for the grilled chicken and he replied snotty what sandwich . I said there wasn't a sandwich name it just said grilled chicken sandwich  and I wanted it protein style. He didn't even know the menu. He was also rude to my dad when asking what cook he wanted on the burger. Never brought us fries or anything the manager however came by and brought us fries. It only went down hill from there when the food runner brought our food and asked if we were missing anything and clearly my dads food was not there. It took another 5 minutes to find someone to ask. We asked the manager and he went to find his food . The service was terrible , I don't even want to go back to the location purely because of just service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-parker-2

Jafey A.,"Parker, CO",6,398,,1.0,8/8/2017,"The service here is always good and the food is never that bad, but the manager is the least professional manager I have ever seen at a chain restaurant.  I didn't want free food, dint have any complaints, just needed a table that didn't share the booth bench with another table that's literally it.  It was 4pm so it wasn't busy (which is when we always eat since we understand during the dinner rush seating may be limited) and the manager refused to allow us to sit in any other seating area.  This has never been a problem and the host is always able to take care of us but the person that is supposed to be running the restaurant won't? My wife is the friendliest person on earth and was polite to him but he wouldnt budge, so I walked up and said we will go elsewhere, he said that sounds good.  We will never come back and I will send a more detailed message to their corporate office.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-parker-2

Mark H.,"Parker, CO",10,370,110,4.0,2/26/2017,"For 2017 working to review 119 dining places in Parker Colorado, 18 of 120. A reliable burger chain with a ""wide variety"" of burgers if you don't like what's on the menu, you can customize it to your heart's delight. It's encouraged, unlike other places that judge you or flat out refuse to allow substitutions or your own creations. The ""bottomless"" (God Bless America!) steak fries are okay but can be inconsistent one batch is fine and the next batch is overdone. I believe a lot of this is due to the fry change they made some years back, they have never been the same. Any way if you can't wait for your food they will bring a basket for you to munch on while your entrees are being prepared. Our burgers came out hot and delicious. The best thing these days at Red Robin is the bar area is 21 and over.  We stopped coming for many years after our kids got older now empty nesters...

We went last night and the service was great, friendly and attentive, but the food quality has dropped off.  It feels like they are trying to cut costs and in doing so the quality, flavor and overall experience has suffered.  My son ordered the curly spaghetti and it came out as a warmed up square block of noodles with some sauce on top. He did not like it. My other son's burger was bland.

I was the only one in my family of 4 to order chicken, and the only to get sick. After a grueling 14 hours, I was basically better aside from getting my strength back. My family eats here a lot, and I would say they are consistently 4 stars, with consistent food and pretty good service, with occasional misses with the service.

When I was visiting relatives in Parker, they wanted to hit the bar and grab some food. This is how I found myself at a Red Robin for the first time in 8 years. Remembering how the meat used to make me gag, I opted for a grilled chicken sandwich. Imagine my delight when the kitchen had no problems wrapping it in lettuce instead of a bun and then they offered -- here's the kicker -- a side salad, cole slaw or fresh broccoli instead of fries....and ALL WERE UNLIMITED! Yes! All you can eat salad, cole slaw or broccoli if you don't want french fries! I'm in love!  The food was just ""meh."" Acceptable but nothing to write home about.

I ordered the Avo-Cobb-O Salad as I usually do.  Today I had one of the biggest shocks ever. The salad came out on a square plate, a quarter the size it used to be. The portion was ridiculously small. I was honestly so surprised. The price was the same, the salad was very small. I loved red robin because of the fact that the salads were bigger portions. It's extremely disappointing when one of your favorite restaurants makes a menu change that only benefits the company. I asked the waitress and she said it was something cooperate.  I don't really know how to feel about Red Robin anymore. I came in last week and I had the full portion salad, and now it's gone. Just like that.

Pam H.,"Parker, CO",10,47,2,3.0,9/10/2015,"I've really missed Red Robin while living in Brentwood, TN. There wasn't a location anywhere near us. I ate at the Parker, CO location last week and my chicken sandwich was good, but what has happened to the steak fries? They used to be about an inch wide, thick, and very good! Now it seems they are using a cheaper product and many of the fries were from the edge of the potato. They aren't any good anymore and in my opinion, that's what set them apart from other burger joints.  I think, if they're looking to cut cost, ditch the bottomless fries and return to the product that they used in the past!! I'd rather have a smaller amount of a top-notch product than an unlimited amount of an inferior product.

The family part is completely gone. My husband and one of my granddaughters felt sick after eating their food. I felt sick by the completely mismatched themes and the family restaurant gone wild appearances. The first table we were seated at wobbled so badly my granddaughter almost fell.
