Mark B.,"Houston, TX",416,313,2206,4.0,7/18/2017,"First thing: there is plenty of parking available behind the restaurant.  I hadn't been to a Red Robin in years! First discovered them in Portland and fell in love. I honestly have no idea why it took me so long to return.  Always a great burger and great service. I mentioned my tomato allergy to the server and wound up talking to the manager about it. They showed genuine concern.  The burger was very tasty, as were the fries. I requested them a little crispy, and they were.  Very positive experience all the way around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland
Herman L.,"Houston, TX",30,113,264,3.0,8/7/2017,"It's been years since I've been to a Red Robin, but we stopped by on a quiet Saturday around lunch time.  We were seated near the bar and were given pretty decent service.  Drinks were refilled quickly anyway.  I wish their basket of fries were larger so I wouldn't have to keep asking them for more.  The tavern burgers are pretty small, so go for the larger size.  They are more like fast food size.  Other burgers looked a bit more decent, but on the whole, they are about average.  Pricing matches the quality of the food though.  This is a pretty solid 3 star place, meaning I'd be back but not because I was craving it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland
Trina M.,"Fresno, TX",102,381,58,5.0,2/12/2017,My daughter and I decided to stop in yesterday. We had a craving for burgers and one out of a window just wouldn't do. This location is close to the house and at 1pm on Saturday was decently full. No wait for a table though.  My daughter and I picked the same thing - bacon cheeseburger. I had mine wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun and black beans instead of fries as I'm trying to make better choices. O.M.G. that was in the top five of best burgers I've had in life! Wow they slam dunked it on flavor. The service was also spot on. Quirky thing is they have touch screen computers at the table and you can add to your order and pay right there.  Oh and as for better choices.... We also had the donut dessert... It's a tower of their version of the cronut with dipping sauces. Delish!!!! Totally worth trading the bun on the burger.....lol! WINNER!!! **Milestone 300th review!!!!!!!  :-) *******,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland
Justin T.,"Pearland, TX",1440,254,894,2.0,5/22/2017,"Red Robin usually hits the spot for me when I'm craving a decent burger, but this location continues to disappoint. I've given this location quite a few chances since it is close to home, but our experiences are consistently bad. The restaurant is usually pretty empty, so getting a seat for our big party is no hassle.  What makes me rank this place so low is mainly based on customer service. I'm sure there are great employees there, but we seem to get stuck with the person with the worst attitude. It feels like we are always inconveniencing our waitress. We are pretty chill as customers and don't ask for much, so no need for the sorry service.  Now the food is hit and miss. I've had decent meals here, but more times than none, it was a miss. I ordered the Fiery Ghost Tavern Double. Talk about no flavor whatsoever. It's supposed to be a spicy burger, but it was as bland as it gets. The way they top the burger also makes it completely soggy and it falls apart after the first few bites. I will say the burgers my family got that were on ciabatta buns were pretty good. What I do love about this place is the bottomless steak fries and the freckled lemonade.  Hopefully they step up the customer service and get that place back to being busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland
Stephen E.,"Houston, TX",79,6,2,1.0,11/20/2017,I was seated promptly.  Watched several members of the wait staff walk by without stopping to take my drink order. After waiting 15 minutes and turning on the call server function on the portable kiosk....I left.

Steve L.,"Missouri City, TX",450,302,361,4.0,8/2/2016,"We love Red Robin and glad they opened up in Pearland! I just re-joined the Red Royalty rewards since on your birthday they give you a free burger... However, it becomes valid 24 hours after you register. So if you are going for your birthday, think ahead and register at least a day or more ahead. We had great service from our server, who was very courteous and proactive. You only have to know one burger- the Royal Red Robin burger with a fried egg on the top. Get that and endless fries, and you will be very satisfied. Also make sure you try their sauces (most of them are add'l cost) but the sweet and spicy ketchup is free. It's pretty good! And make sure you get a freckled strawberry lemonade. Our server split up the mac and cheese and the kid's drinks too. When we asked about it, it was no big deal because the mac is bottomless. Did not know that, but a helpful  tip! The tavern burgers are also really good value if you are going for something light.  #Yelp100challenge2016",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland
Summer L.,"Pearland, TX",23,55,19,2.0,9/17/2017,"I have always loved this place, but the last time I came here, the customer service was awful. We stood and waited (nobody else was waiting and there was hardly anybody dining there) for 10 minutes for a staff member to even come close to us. One of the girls that worked there walked past us and yelled ""there's people waiting here, but I'm leaving!"" to another staff member so they can come help us. It was very unprofessional and rude to not even acknowledge us - no hi how are you, sorry for the wait, or anything. Finally, another girl came up to get us seated and I let her know how unprofessional that was and how we'd been waiting. Our waitress was very friendly, but that ruined my experience here, especially since it was my friends first time here and I had been talking it up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland

Tish P.,"Houston, TX",907,408,1021,4.0,4/28/2015,"My niece wanted a good, juicy burger for her birthday dinner so we decided to try Red Robin and it turned out to be a good move. We were served by a gentleman named Johnathon.  He was really nice and patient with our indecisive selves.  For those who hang with me, imagine my indecisiveness and multiply x 6 LOL hot mess Had apps of chili cheese fries and spinach dip while we were deciding our burger choices.  I didn't think the fries were worth the money, not cheesy or rich in chili, but the dip was pretty good. I ordered the bacon quac burger and enjoyed it though it definitely could use some more quac, very scarce.  The ""beauty"" of Red Robin is the fact that the burgers come with bottomless fries!  Well isn't that fat genius right there...and they don't skimp on the 2nd portion either.  I can't go past a second helping so if you can, more power to ya! The have an open kitchen and the bathrooms were decent, especially considering the time of day. Seem to be the spot for birthdays as 2 other tables were celebrating.  They sang my niece a HBD song and gave her a dessert on the house...sweet #nopun They have ample parking right behind the restaurant, so if you're in the area, ask for Johnathon then eat, drink, and be merry!

Jim W.,"Houston, TX",0,4,1,1.0,4/14/2017,"What a bitter disappointment. This was my first and last visit to a Red Robin. The burger quality was inferior to that of McDonald's and the portion size for $15 was a crime. I suppose the bottomless fries are supposed to be palliative, but they were parceled in tiny amounts that were smaller than an order of small fries from the afore mentioned Chicago clown. What a rip off!  And Red Robin, shaping a bun into a square does not magically transform it into Ciabatta bread.  How this purveyor of crappy hamburgers stays in business is beyond me. You know it's bad when the Hamburglar rips you off less.  Grimace, where is Mayor McCheese when you need him?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland
Vlad V.,"The Heights, Houston, TX",189,679,188,3.0,2/10/2016,"Houston has so many great restaurants that I try to stay away from the chains. Not that many of them won't give you a solid meal (there's a double negative grammar no-no!). It's just that you could go to a different good local restaurant every day of the year and not run out of options. But when you offer me a free burger and fries on my birthday, you now have my attention! I went with the Banzai burger (lettuce, tomato, cheddar, pineapple slices, teriyaki sauce, mayo) with fries. if you dine in, they offer endless fries for all the fatties out there. Service can be a big hit or a miss but you know what, Red Robin does a pretty fine burger. This is what they're known for and they have a large selection. Not many burger joints offer a Hawaiian/tropical burger like this so it's a nice change of pace. The sweetness of the pineapple and teriyaki contrasts well with the savory burger. Some of the fries, while well seasoned, were undercooked. But hey, we know the main attraction at Red Robin is the burger!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland

I was expecting some kind of wait but the place was pretty empty. Maybe ten tables total. We were seated right away on the bar side and it was freezing in there. We ordered the tower of onion rings and they were excellent. Our waitress was excellent and on top of things. She was hustling but she only had two other tables.  Ok now the bad part....the food. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger on the onion bun. I saw her write it down so I know it was done. Burger comes out and guess what, wrong bun. So they take it back and bring it with the correct bun. Once I bit into it, I looked at it and the bacon was hardly cooked. It was not crispy at all. I like my burgers and my bacon well done.

Deborah R.,"Pasadena, TX",21,226,98,2.0,4/29/2015,"Service was horrible. Sat at the bar after being told there was a 15 min wait. We asked why when there were so many tables open. We were told it was because there were not enough servers because it is usually not this busy on Sunday. We were given a drink and our orders were taken by one of three bartenders. Then every bartender and wait staff simply disappeared. A waiter dropped off our food and once again we were alone. We wanted another drink but could not get anyone to serve us. We finally had to find someone to get our bill, and then it was difficult to get someone to take our money. It was as if nobody wanted to come back to the bar area to wait on us. One of the worst service experiences we have had. The food was nothing like we have had at other Red Robins (which we usually enjoy), the food was bland and unseasoned.

I walked in and asked to place a to go order and the host pointed me to the bar area. I literally sat at the bar for 15 minutes and not one person spoke to me or asked me if I needed anything. I told myself I would never go again. Yesterday June 2, 2017 my boyfriend and I decided to give them a try since BJ's had a wait time of 25 minutes.

Anthony A.,"Manvel, TX",57,290,975,4.0,8/28/2015,"When you're in the mood for a restaurant chain style burger establishment, you can't miss with Red Robin.  They have a very good selection of gourmet burgers as well as their smaller Tavern burgers and their larger premium Finest burgers.  The burgers are cooked to order and always come with bottomless steak fries.  I prefer crispy thinner fries, so sometimes I'll substitute the fries for the sweet potato fries or maybe a vegetable.  The burgers themselves are delicious and filling.  My favorites have been the Royal Red Robin (has an egg), the Bonzai with a pineapple, the Whiskey River BBQ burger, and the Bleu Ribbon burger.  Today I had the Big Pig Out which is a bigger version of their new tavern burger called the Pig Out Style - A bacon-lover's dream, this Tavern Style features a creamy bacon aioli paired with strips of hardwood-smoked bacon.  It was DELICIOUS!  Who says you can't have too much bacon? Burgers average around $10 but again it's a good size portion with unlimited fries.  Their Red's Tavern Burger with fries is advertised at $6.99 all day every day, so there are options for the price conscious. I've had other things which I like as well, such as the Bruschetta Chicken sandwich and the Clucks and Fries, and they are delicious as well.  So you definitely have options to choose from if you're not necessarily in the mood for burgers but the rest of your friends are.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland?start=20

Debbie C.,"Missouri City, TX",42,67,96,3.0,1/31/2016,"Food was okay, but the service was terrible. There were 6 of us in the group. The waitress took our drink orders and before we could order appetizers, she took off. Our drinks were served with almost no ice and when I asked for a cup of ice it took forever for her to bring a tiny cup full. We asked what the ""S"" sauce was and she said, ""I don't know"" and just stood and looked at us. We had to ask her to please find out. When our order came one of the burgers was wrong. When we told her, she just looked at us and said, ""okay, what do you want me to do?"". Our tickets were wrong also. One couple ordered water to drink and they had a soda on their ticket. The soda was missing from our ticket. We just gave them the money to cover the soda because we didn't want to deal with our waitress anymore. Obviously they need to train her better.  We ordered the queso with chips as an appetizer as well as the pretzel bites. The queso was very good. It had a nice spicy flavor and the chips were good and crisp. The pretzel bites tasted like they had been dusted with sugar instead of salt. They had a sweet taste instead of a salty taste that you would expect. The cheese sauce on the side was a grainy liquid cheese that looked like it came from a can. Won't be ordering those again.  Hubby had the Marco Pollo chicken sandwich. It's his favorite thing on the menu. The chicken is moist, tender and flavorful. The peppered bacon is a very nice touch.  I had the black and bleu burger which was a huge disappointment. The meat patty was a skinny piece of meat that was way over cooked. The waitress didn't ask how I wanted it cooked, so I guess the kitchen assumed crispy  and well done was the way to go. There was no bleu cheese flavor and it became a soggy mess that I ate with a fork due the liquid from the sautéed onions and mushrooms and because I added all of the bleu cheese sauce trying to make it have a better taste.  The unlimited fries are a great deal. They are thick cut fries and once you add salt to them, they  are pretty good. They offer a choice of sauces with them and the campfire sauce is awesome! I wish they would bottle it and sell it, because I'd buy it.  We will be going back to Red Robin, we just hope the service is better next time. I will not order the black and bleu, but I'm willing to try some other burgers on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland?start=20

It's official I will never go back.  The customer service is non existent. I've had a different waiter every time, and been ignored every time. I would watch our server laugh with his or her buddies as dishes sat in a window and our cups remained empty. Seeing people fill their own cups up is fun though.  Then once we finally got our food... an hour and a half later... in an almost empty restaurant... it was bad. Way too greasy and unlimited fries would be cool if the food didn't make me sick.

The thing is, it's not really the food that's the problem. The food is pretty good, most of the time. I've never had anything I didn't at least like, and most things were pretty good. The specialty burgers I've had each time we've gone there were really good. The bottomless fries are yummy. I love the fried zucchini a lot. We've had the veggie sampler appetizer too, which was good. I love the twisted raspberry drink thingies and the other drink specials. I hate that they serve alcohol, because it just doesn't seem like that type of place to me--I don't know, like, it's this 'family' oriented place, but then there's these bottles of liquor all over the place. Just seems out of place to me. The service isn't horrible, but it's never really been good. We've always had to sit up front and wait a long time before we are seated, even when they aren't super busy. I don't fully understand that. The hostesses who have been there haven't been very friendly or upbeat either. They aren't exactly rude, but they certainly aren't the nicest folks I've met. We've had one good waitress of all the times we've gone--she was fabulous. She brought refills, brought fresh fries, without us asking, and even recommended some good items on the menu. she pointed out specials and everything a good waitress should do. We're big tippers when the service warrants it and we rewarded her for this, most definitely. The problem is, out of all our visits there, she's the only one who really stood out. Since they are so far away from us, and the food is good but nothing amazing, and the service isn't great, we just have finally decided it's best just not to go any more. There are better places to go closer to where we live. That all said, my best friend regularly goes to a different Red Robin and has said the service there is much better. But even though the website says they have low-carb items there, the staff aren't very familiar with the special dietary items the website says they have. So really, I think service is a matter of which store you end up at. It's a shame it's not more consistent across the board. As for accessibility, well... they're okay. When the restaurant is super busy, it's really difficult to maneuver between tables and it's annoying to have to disturb folks who are eating just to try to get my wheelchair by.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland?start=20

Kassidy took our drinks orders and left when we was ready to place our food orders another lady took them for us. Now about 10 to 15 minutes had pass and Kassidy hasn't came back to check on the table are refill drinks.Now the food is ready every one on that staff brought our food to use except Kassidy. She is still MIA now we are about 35 minutes into dinner still with no refills and its 5 teenagers at this table. So we had to literally get out our sets go to the bar and ask for a refill. At this point we are ready to go 5 minutes go by before we see any one. And surprise its Kassidy! We ask her where shes been? and she tells us ""I was cleaning"". I was taken back by her answer but i let it go. We asked her for the check and to-go drinks. Another 5 minutes go by and we still don't have drinks are checks. Kassidy moved with no sense of urgency. Finally a young man comes from the back his name was Aaron he as very attentive.

Others who placed their order after us received their food before we did and our order was nothing special.  Once it finally came (delivered by someone else) the fried egg I asked for was sunny side up.  When I mentioned it to the guy who brought the food he looked at the egg as if he was confused and didn't know the difference.  I said I asked for a fried egg and this one is a sunny side up.  He then said ""oh, you mean over hard"".  Over hard is fried.....  That also took forever as my friend was already on her second half of her burger.  All you have to do is flip the egg over for a few and bam.. you have a fried egg or over hard as the guy stated.  So while the guy stood there waiting for my egg, my fries were getting cold and no I did not receive new fries.  Also it was very clear that we were out of fries once we were almost finish... we were never asked if we wanted more.  You guys do offer bottomless fries correct?  Overall experience is that I do not want to come back and as I stated I have always loved Red Robin.. not so much anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland?start=40

Probably the best thing was the fried zucchini appetizer, even though it was untouchably hot and rather difficult to eat. And, to be fair, I must also say I really enjoyed the tea. But as Two Stars already says so well: ""Meh. I've experienced better."" If I'm in the area and really want a burger, I'll drive to the other side of 288 and go to Whataburger. Yep. Whataburger. *sigh*",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland?start=80
aimee r.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/5/2014,We usually enjoy red robin. This one we will not return to. The restaurant was absolutely freezing in December. My husband's chicken entree was cold. The tortilla soup tasted like water. I ordered a burger lettuce wrapped but it came with a bun. We ordered chips/salsa as an app but it came out less than 5 minutes before our dinner. At least my daughters Mac and cheese was good and warm. The waitress seemed overwhelmed. We won't be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland?start=80
Tiffany A.,"Pearland, TX",165,183,78,3.0,9/17/2012,"The burgers here are just average. I have been to several Red Robin locations and the food seems to be pretty consistent at every location. Each time I visit, I order a different burger. They all taste a little similar. Somewhat greasy but packed with flavor. I'm not a huge fan of their fries, I like mine a bit thinner and crispy. The wedges aren't that crispy but always come out piping hot. My boyfriend and I love their strawberry lemonade here and always get one to share since there's free refills! He loves the Royal Red Robin burger because it gets topped off with a fried egg. Overall service was good and the food was good. I always leave feeling a bit heavy and greasy though so this isn't a restaurant I would visit often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland?start=80
Michael R.,"Houston, TX",1,7,,4.0,9/30/2013,"If you're craving a burger - great service and a clean restaurant are here.  Slightly overpriced, yes, but the menu is large with numerous options.  Can't complain about the taste.  Seems like a fun place to bring a group of friends, yet the atmosphere is good for kids, too.  I'll be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland?start=80

Dwight W.,"Houston, TX",0,5,1,2.0,10/8/2014,Dissapointed- Food was mediocre. We did not receive much food for our money. They try to make up for the tiny burgers by giving you lbs of french fries. The hamburger meat had no flavor. They tried to cover up the lack of flavor with condiments and etc. The building is nice inside and has a good atmosphere. Waitstaff was friendly. But I will not be returning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland?start=80

Shawn P.,"Houston, TX",60,257,18,2.0,6/10/2010,"Red Robin sucks...now that I have got that out of the way-I would say that Red Robin sucks because there are better options for a burger. When they first came on the scene a few years back, they made a pretty decent burger. The idea of bottomless fries was pretty good, especially for them, since they wouldnt lose money by offering this...really; who can eat tons of steak cut fries anyway?  I would liken Red Robin to Burger King, just with more options. Nothing to see here people...move along.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland?start=80
Lynda L.,"Pearland, TX",49,9,,1.0,7/19/2009,"This was my first time in a Red Robin, and it will be my last.  I had the Blue Ribbon Burger and fries.  It tasted pretty good while it was going down, but before I had even finished eating, I started to get a classic MSG headache.  By the time I got home my head was pounding.  Hubby isn't usually effected by MSG, but he got a headache too.  This was probably the worst MSG headache I have ever had.  After searching the net a little, I discovered that they use MSG on their fries, and I would suspect there was some in the hamburger too, but don't quote me on that. If you don't mind ingesting a lot of Monosodium Glutamate, then you might do better that I did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland?start=80

Wendy B.,"Pearland, TX",109,69,20,2.0,11/27/2009,"I've been to Red Robin at least ten times in the past year and only go there as it's my 13yr old's preferred restaurant in the area due to the TWO veggie patty choices that can be substituted on any sandwich. Both the fake beefy Boca burger and the typical Morning Star type grain patty are available , so vegetarians have more options than the usual burger place. She usually gets the Blue Ribbon Burger with the Boca patty, which has blue cheese crumbles and some rich dressing plus onion strings and standard veggies. I get the Whiskey River BBQ Burger with the Boca patty, which has onion strings, mayo (bleh), BBQ sauce, standard veggies. The burgers are so messy that they have little paper diapers on them plus they come with steak fries, which are tasty but totally frozen and in line with Ore-Ida. I prefer fresh cut fries with skins, to each their own I guess. The cost of the burgers are about $10, so this is not an inexpensive place to bring a family. The onion rings are also very frozen-y tasting but the breaded zucchini spears are very good with a nice crisp tempura type batter.  The service is always a drag. Either your order is incorrect or slow or you don't get napkins, and I always request to sit in a booth in a corner as otherwise you'll be seated next to little kids as it's very crammed for space and I've already raised my own kids and prefer not to have a toddler breathing on my $10 veggie burger. There is a full bar as well but I've never tried anything there.   Every time I go, I vow not to return as I usually have that greasy belly sensation halfway into the burger. However, old habits die hard and the kids ask to go and how quickly I forget...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland?start=80

Jennifer S.,"Houston, TX",17,31,1,2.0,2/10/2010,"Everyone felt like burgers, so we figured Red Robin would do the trick, considering that is the pretty much their specialty. We were all dissappointed except for my friend who ordered  a salad! First, the fries were just your run of the mill french fries, nothing special at all. I had the mushroom burger. Cooked right, but the meat had no flavor and the mushrooms were supposed to be garlic, and they were not. The other burgers ordered were thought to be the same, nothing special. And the specialty drinks are nothing more than sprite, with some flavoring added. For almost $4, I would stick with the sprite alone instead. The seating is a bit annoying too. It is mainly bench seating on one side and chair seating on the other. Not easy to get in and out of, especially for children and elderly.  The parking can be a bit far from the restaurant entrance, since it is located in an outside mall type venue. Basic conclusion: Nothing special!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland?start=80
Karri L.,"Pearland, TX",0,6,,1.0,8/31/2012,"This experience occurred a few months ago and I haven't been back since. (and I won't return) I have been to many Red Robin locations over the years, not sure about the food here, I became so irritated with the lack of service that I left after I got my drinks. Let me clarify, when I entered the restaurant there was one other couple inside. We were seated and watched 2 more families come in, be seated and served drinks. (the servers all saw us and walked by) after about 20 minutes the hostess came and informed us that she had seated us in a section that didn't have a server assigned (ok no problem) and she needed us to move, 18 INCHES, to the table next to us. After we scooted to the neighboring table a young girl came to take our drink order (water and a Dr Pepper) and got irritated when we wanted to place our food order as well (we had spent plenty of time reviewing the menu) She had to come back 3 times to clarify what drink we were getting because she kept stopping to talk to other employees and would forget. After the third time I told her never mind and she looked shocked. As we were leaving the hostess (who had reseated us 15 minutes prior) said ""hope everything was great"". I informed her that it wasn't and I would not ever return to this location. True to my word I haven't. As far as food quality? I have no idea.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland?start=80
