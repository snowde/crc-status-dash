Mike M.,"Glendale, AZ",0,43,9,1.0,5/5/2016,"Great burgers terrible service, there location is the only thing that keeps them open. They advertise 50% off a second burger excluding  Tavern Burgers would not provide. They have no on line ordering, for take out, no curbside take out. Again there so busy because there location that they can be one to two star and still have a wait.  I even emailed there Corp office first to see how they would reply, they only argued with me, no offer to make it right. There are so many other good places. Will not go back and will press the word.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-peoria-3?start=20
Mike T.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,3,,1.0,5/10/2017,This place is horrible I returned a burger explained what was wrong and was brought the exact same wet soggy burger.

Jennifer A.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,47,5,2.0,9/17/2016,"Unfortunately this location did not seem to have it together. I will start off by saying that our server was very attentive and friendly, so that was appreciated. I am used to the Happy Valley location and was expecting the same food/drink. I ordered the jalapenorita which says it comes with fresh jalapeño slivers...it did not and I had to ask for them. I ordered the garlic herb fries and they looked nothing like the Happy Valley location...there was hardly any garlic and not one herb. We had two small  combined tables (for 3 people) and my side of the table was so wobbly that it made it very uncomfortable. Oh yes, my mothers salad came with garlic toast, but it was so burned it did not taste normal. I'll be going to the Happy Valley location in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-peoria-3?start=20

Greeter gal was not having a good day she was giving us that oh no party of 8 look  Server was trying his best however the cooks got it very wrong with undercooked chicken 1 wrong burger and soggy fries on the kids meals. The manager apologized for the chicken they cooked another one however the party was over by the time the salad came out. The wrong burger has pieces of mac and cheese and I did not order that item.

Lauren I.,"Glendale, AZ",0,6,1,4.0,6/18/2017,We typically order take-out from Red Robin instead of eating inside. The food tastes good and is always ready within 20 minutes of ordering. My only issue is that they just seem to throw our food into the to-go container. My burger is always falling apart. They definitely don't care about presentation for the to-go orders.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-peoria-3?start=20

Taylor F.,"Phoenix, AZ",14,26,11,1.0,9/10/2017,"I went to this Red Robin after receiving a gift card for a terrible experience that I had at a different location. Big surprise.. I visited this Red Robin and had a crappy experience.. so I give up! My husband and I ordered two appetizers and one dessert to spend our gift card. We got our 'double berry cheesecake' with no actual berries (it was supposed to come with strawberries and a berry sauce). It came with the berry sauce, which was like a watered down strawberry jam, but no strawberries. Then we also ordered these chips covered in pulled pork and cheese and red onions... and it came straight from the microwave. It had been microwaved so long that it was impossible to pull the chips apart and the cheese was not melty anymore. It was more like a rock. Not to mention, it didn't even come with the onions it mentions in the description and shows in the photo. When I asked the very busy bartender if she could send it back and request that it not be microwaved, she said that they microwave it to get the cheese to melt, instead of obliging and apologizing. When I told her that the description did not say that it was microwaved and that I would like it to not be microwaved, she again did not apologize but instead gave me an attitude and wandered off with the returned food. After this experience, my husband and I will definitely not be returning to Red Robin. Between the bad attitudes and the seriously crappy food... it's not worth another try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-peoria-3?start=20
Diane A.,"Glendale, AZ",21,8,2,3.0,3/13/2017,The food and service was very good my only issue was with where we were seated . The floor was full of food (probably from a baby) and crumbs on my seat but you think they would clean it before they sat the next person down it was nasty I was smashing it into the carpet and it wasn't just where we sat there was quite a few other places that I could see.This was at the Peoria location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-peoria-3?start=20

Me: ""yes"" Food delivered...WELL done. Why do you ask if you can't deliver?!?  Anywho, I talk to the manager face to face. She says ""oh, it's on a conveyer belt...we can't do pink"". To which I say ""why would the server offer a choice?"" Her response, ""if you order the angus burger we can do more pink"".  Are the servers not trained on what burger I order whether is ""regular"" or ""angus"" patties??  Then she continues to say ""well if you tell your server, they can do it"". Mmmmmmmkay, rewind...""I just told the server I wanted a little pink"". The employee next to the manager said ""we can't because of food borne illnesses"". I'm so confused now.

Summer M.,"Phoenix, AZ",22,56,27,4.0,7/14/2016,"My husband and I went here last night to celebrate our birthdays. We love the Red Robin Royalty program. We both got our free birthday burgers. Not only did we enjoy the food(which was actually 100% correct and perfectly done this time), but we had a great time and enjoyed our overall experience. In recent visits, we have had many complaints and issues, so bad that we've debated ever going back here. Since we were getting free food anyways, we figured we would try again. Melissa was amazing. She was on top of our bottomless fries refills, rootbeer float refills, and even noticed we didnt have napkins or silverware and brought those to us before we even noticed. She was very busy, had so many tables, but she still took such good care of us. The other servers should take notes from Melissa, she is the best server we have ever had at Red Robin.    Only a couple of small issues to bring to managment attention: 1.) No light on our booth, light above us was blown. It was difficult to get good lighting for birthday pics 2.) The food took a little long to get to us, but we were in no rush, it came out hot and fresh, and was all correct. 3.) One of the female servers who is alittle on the plus size( no shame in that as I am as well), had the back of her shirt pulled up, showing her back side and slight underwear showing. Maybe an undershirt would he helpful? 4.) There was a dirty towel sitting in the same place on a ledge near us the whole time we were there. These are the reasons I have a 4 instead of a 5. I was actually pleasantly surprised with our experience and I will continue to go back, especially if we can keep.getting Michelle for our server, or ones.just like her. I also.have to mention the hostess(didn't catch her name). She was such a lovely girl. She greeted us and sat us promptly. She was such a sweet girl and had a genuine  kindness and beautiful smile. On the way out the door, she actually got to it and opened it up for us befire we got there. She set the tone for the experience, as she is the first and last one we see. This is the experience we and everyone else should get every single time. These girls have really raises the bar, hopefully we can expect consistency in our future visits. Thank you girls and the rest of Red Robin employees who worked last night, for making it such a nice birthday dinner for us. P.S. Happy Birthday, Melissa!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-peoria-3?start=20

Our ketchup bottle was empty, by the time we rec'd another bottle we were almost done with our meals. The worst part of this experience was the stupid computer thing that's supposed to be convenient. It's the worst! VERY frustrating!! The lettering is tiny and it was out of paper for a receipt.  We don't want to use a computer, we want our waitress to give us the bill.

Karen G.,"Glendale, AZ",1,53,,3.0,6/2/2017,"We went in about 4:15 on a Wed.  It was lightly busy and were seated right away. We both ordered burgers and they were pretty good.  I ordered double patty Bourbon BBQ. It was good and cooked as ordered.  The other was a lettuce wrapped burger which was good also.  Fries were fresh and not greasy at all.  The waitress was in a hurry and was pushing us to order though we ordered drinks and a 1/2 stack of onions rings  which were very good and crunchy.  Burgers arrived in about 15 minutes.  We were still eating and the waitress came and asked about deserts.  We said we had to finish first, and then we never saw her again. No refill of drinks, water, or the supposed bottomless steak fries.  We paid using the machine and never did get desert.  They advertise to come in and hang out, but the service is pushing you out the door before you are even done eating.  The burgers were good enough, and reasonably priced to try again.  But next time, I hope we get another waitress who isn't in such a big hurry that she forgets what her job is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-peoria-3?start=20

However, I'm HUGE on customer service. Poor service can and does make or break an establishment.  The lack of professionalism with with this woman handled my visit from the moment I walked in the door displays a complete lack of concern for the customer, her fellow employees, and Red Robin's name.   The Peter Principle incarnate.  Disgusting.  We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-peoria-3?start=40

My girlfriend went to pickup the order after about 15-20 minutes and they told me they had no order whatsoever.  I called back while my girlfriend was there to inquire about the order was just told, we're really busy.  I could tell that there was difficulty communicating in English so I didn't press it and chalked it up to misunderstanding. It just took our ""quick pickup"" dinner plan into a 45 minutes to an hour dinner plan which was a big let down.  Very disappointed.  I know they're busy and I can handle delays and wait times, but to just entirely not enter orders and disregard it especially when I take the time to come pick it up is frustrating. I would just prefer to hear ""I'm busy and won't be entering this order"" which is totally fine, I would just like to make different arrangements for dinner. *Updated*  After 5-10 minutes they came back and said they had in fact found the order in the system and apologized for the inconvenience.  We still had a delay and additional wait time, but they gave our daughter a free milkshake while they waited for inconvenience.  I appreciated that effort and changed it from 1 star to 3 stars for doing their best to correct it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-peoria-3?start=40
Michael M.,"Peoria, AZ",171,30,8,3.0,6/6/2016,"We've been going here for a couple years and I have never put up a review of it.  So let me first say, this has NOTHING to do with service.  Service i so subjective that I hate to even see it in a review.  The best wait-person in the world will have an off day or rub someone the wrong way.  This is about the food.  (Specifically, the burgers) I really feel this place should be in Vegas, because you throw the dice every time you walk in the place.  I'm giving them 3 stars because I have had about as many good burgers as I have had bad ones.  It really is a crap shoot as to whether you will get something you like or something that you will wish you went someplace else.   And I'm not talking about the 400 different styles of burger.   The end product has no consistency, so if you find a favorite, be prepared to be disappointed half the time.  Personally, I normally get the patty melt, as it seems to be the easiest one for them to Not screw up.  However, even here, the quality and the final product varies Wildly.   Dining in, is better, but not a guarantee for quality.  However, you do have the chance to send it back and have them make an attempt at fixing it for you.  On The Other Hand..,  if we get food for takeout, then place your bets.  Their takeout is the worst, and we have come home to stone cold burgers, congealed grease fries, and mistake orders.  If fact the takeout is so bad that if we have to order for carryout, we now go somewhere else.  Which is sad, because when they are on point, this place has one of the top 5 burgers in town.  But when it is bad...  I'd be more happy with Jack in the Box. Go ahead and give it a shot.  It is worth the gamble, but remember what you get your first time, next time it will be a completely different burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-peoria-3?start=40

I'm extremely glad that my wife and I decided to go tonight. Our server Paul was on his game. It's like he could read my mind and replenish my drink or fries before I asked. The restaurant also has a kiosk at each table to order, get more drink, pay the bill, ask for the server. It was great. I ordered the buzz mac and cheese burger. Two patties with mac and cheese between them. I live mac and cheese and the idea for this burger was great. McDonalds Big Mac has nothing on these all beef patties.

It was ok but pretty skimpy on the burger patty and the pulled pork. I guess at least the BBQ sauce was good. Hubby ordered a pig out burger and was told it was the larger of two similar burgers. The burger was smaller than a Wendy's double and he ordered it well done and it came closer to rare. It also came with some veggies which he requested not be on the burger (same as another person in our party). We told the waitress but since we all had our food already we didn't want to have to wait.  She said she'd mention it to the manager and we expected something to be discounted on the bill but there was nothing mentioned or taken off the bill. The fries were mushy but one basket actually came out hot so those were good. Our server was very good but the food is overpriced and not that great.

I ordered a short stack of onion rings and the pretzel bites. The cheese dip for the pretzel bites was cold and had a skin over the top when it was brought to the table.

Craig S.,"Peoria, AZ",25,303,99,3.0,3/1/2017,"Some years ago I ate at a Red Robin in California. Even though this place was only a few miles from the house I have not been there. Seems everyone is advertising a gourmet burger. If it is a gourmet burger you can charge 3 to 4 dollars more. I looked up gourmet burger and read what three different people said. The one that made the most since was any burger that is more than hamburger, lettuce, tomato, cheese (American cheese which to me is plastic cheese), can be called a gourmet burger. Which does not mean it is any better tasting than a regular hamburger done right. I don't remember the exact burger I ordered but I asked for it without a bun and no fries. They did what I thought was the right thing and said I could have a salad instead of the fries. Nice!! Most places will do this but want an extra dollar or more. Hats off to Red Robin. They sandwiched the burger between two pieces of lettuce that consisted of about three leafs each side. Again hats off to Red Robin I was impressed with the presentation.  As they say two out of three aint bad. I am having a hard time putting a finger on it but the customer service could of been better and something abut the layout of the restaurant did not appeal to me. Price is another factor.

The menu is pretty much a variety of all types of burgers. They didn't have pictures for all of them but did have a description for them all. They also had salads and soups. I decided to go with the guacamole bacon burger and added an over easy egg.  My burger was cooked just fine. The only downfall to this guacamole burger is that I didn't taste any guacamole. I looked at my burger and there was a very thin layer of guacamole spread on top of the bun but was covered by a bunch of lettuce. With all the different toppings such as lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and bacon it was sad that I couldn't taste the main ingredient and the actual component that the burger is named by which is the guacamole.  The fries were good and tasted better with the salt seasoning- that is your choice to use or not on the table.  Donuts were ordered to our table for dessert. The donuts came with chocolate and strawberry dipping sauces and was covered in sugar. It was good but definitely too sweet for my palate.  Not too sure if I would ever come to RR again for a burger being that I wasn't too satisfied this time around and for it being a gourmet burger joint I expected to be wowed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-peoria-3

Once we got our servers attention she was very quick to bring our burgers out and was overall accommodating when we kept asking for refills on the bottomless and endless refills of steak fries.  I ordered the whiskey bbq burger with an over easy egg and it was delicious and runny and filled with fatty flavors.

The seats are comfy and the booths are roomy (fluffy friendly). And each table is equipped with a tablet that lets you order drinks, appetizers, desserts, and your meal (or you could just wait for your server but it is a time saving tool for sure)- and pay.  The food is hot and fresh! You can customize your burger order with a variety of buns which is a plus and they offer bottomless fries AND broccoli. Kinda nice that they offer healthier options but I'll stick with the steak fries. Be sure to sprinkle the table-side seasoning on your fries too for the extra kick in flavor.

I had the Double Mac and Cheese Burger for $6.99. The patties were delicious, the buns were a little soft. The mac and cheese just made the burger more cheesy. I was satisfied.

The meat patties themselves were cooked correctly.  But the buns were barely toasted.  I requested dark caramelized onions and only had a small dollop on my burger. Other than that it was OK considering how busy they were, except for the deep fried cod. It was not cod.  It was closer to tilapia in texture and taste.  The manager kept insisting they only stocked cod. I grew up eating seafood on the coast and cod has a distinct flavor.  It wasn't old cod which would have had an old ""fishy"" taste.  It was some other species of mild tasting white fish and it was old.  The fryer oil had not been changed so the crust was greasy.

John P.,"Phoenix, AZ",39,161,11,2.0,7/26/2012,"I often want to shy away from criticizing companies that  mess up gluten free offerings because it's so easy for them to decide it's not worth it and remove them altogether.    That being said...   If you pay an extra $1 to have an item that will stop you from feeling like death for a few hours it would be nice if it your burger was between it. Should that part be messed up  then it wouldn't just be taken away,  swapped over, and then given back now that the meats cooled and a lot of the juices/ additions were stuck to the old bread. it's not as appetizing as it sounds. How about offering to remake it, a new fresh burger just like the one we paid for?   The fiery Jolokia burger is nowhere near as fearsome as it should be. E.G., it's lower than a raw habanero which is not what I was looking for which is a damn same as it really tastes great  and should I ever want to blend up a burger to feed to a small child I'll keep it in mind. I'm as harsh to a company proportional to their claims of  how spicy they claim their food is.  Overall this location gets a 2, the burnt to hell coffee that came out on the first attempt should get you a 1. In their defense the ""fresh"" pot was nearly as acrid so it's hard to think that there's not some cost cutting on coffee occurring but most places that late in the day ask me if it's ok to wait while the make a new pot, not give you whatever's stuck to the carafe at the time",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-peoria-3?start=100
Leanna A.,"Scottsdale, AZ",7,142,106,1.0,12/2/2014,"I really have experienced better. One of the slowest and most awkward meal services I've had in a while...  We came here this past Sunday, and the place was really busy-- I'll give them that. We were seated immediately, by someone who I presumed was a manager, and they told us our server would be right with us. Ten minutes later, the same manager came over and said that our server was too busy inputting orders for another table so he would take our drink order. As per their menu, I asked if they had Minute Maid Light Lemonade, and the manager-esque person flat out said no. I would have appreciated an ""I'm sorry, we're out"" or something, but I just got a ""no."" I'm not sure if this had to do with incompetence or just laziness, but that was my first strike. I ended up ordering soda water and my boyfriend got Dr. Pepper. When I ordered soda water with lime, the same guy said ""wow, that's weird..."" Ok....? I didn't care what he thought of my drink selection, but I was more appalled at the way he was presenting himself. After he brought us our drinks, he asked is we were hot. The restaurant was significantly chilly, so we said no. He proceeded to say ""well I'm hot,"" and then walked to the wall and adjusted the thermostat. I was thinking to myself, no shit you're not, you're running around a busy restaurant... but whatever.  Our server finally came to the table. No greeting, no introduction, she just asked what we wanted to order. We started with an order of mozzarella sticks, and said we weren't ready to order our entree. She came back two times while we were looking at out menus and asked if we knew what we wanted yet. Needless to say we felt rushed. Once we had decided, I ordered a bowl of the French onion soup with a side of broccoli, and my boyfriend ordered the fish and chips and fries.  45 minutes after ordering the mozzarella sticks, they decided to come out. They were good. Not the greatest I've ever had, but very consistent with Red Robin quality. No complaints there other than the time it took to move the food out of the window. While eating the sticks, we ran out of drinks and they were not replenished until after our food was delivered. Additionally, I asked the server 2 times for an extra side of limes and she never brought them to the table until the third time when my boyfriend asked and she finally delivered them after our entrees were brought out.  Probably about 30-35 minutes after the mozzarella sticks came out, our food was delivered. I really don't think it takes that long to pour a ladle of soup into a bowl and steam some broccoli, but apparently Red Robin thinks so. Anyhow, my soup was lukewarm. The cheese ontop of the bread in the soup made up about half of the soup's volume, and because the soup was no longer hot it was the consistency of bubble gum. I picked it out. My broccoli was delivered separately, about five minutes after, and without a fork. I had to wait about 10 minutes to get a fork from the server, and by that time the broccoli was cold too. The fish and chips came out fine, with the exception of the server dropping one of the strips off the plate and having to bring another one a few minutes later.  Overall, this 2 and a half hour dining experience could have been much more enjoyable, espcially considering that many tables around us that were seated after us with larger parties were attended to better and quicker than we were.

Aubrey A.,"Phoenix, AZ",42,13,1,1.0,11/14/2013,"I used to come here pretty frequently but this location has gone to the dogs!

I've definitely been turned off from this place.

Eric C.,"Sun City, AZ",5,49,,2.0,10/1/2010,"2 teenagers and myself on a Thursday night. My daugher loves this place. Me, I haven't been to a RR in years.  We walk in and are seated right away. Waitress arrives within about 5 minutes. By this time I had a chance to look over the menu so we order drinks and food. Valerie? brings the drinks quickly and as she is setting them on the table she makes a comment that she forgot straws. She comes right back with straws and lays them on the table. Normally this would not be a problem BUT, the straws were not wrapped. Uhhh, nasty!  Strike 1 Daughter tells me that they bring every table a basket of fries, so I'm excited about that. The table next to us is on thier second basket and have not been served entrees yet. 2 women are seated at the table behind us and we watch our waitress bring them a basket and she tells them ""here's some fries to munch on while you wait"". Hmmm....she never mentioned it to us or bring US fries. WTF? Stike 2 Order arrives quickly. Me: bacon burger with bleu cheese. Daughter: salad with chicken strips. Son: chicken strips and fries. My burger is pretty good. Son and daughter love what they got....they're happy. My son grabs the ketchup...squirt, fart, spray. Empty. We wait for someone for a few minutes but alas, no one is around. So I get up on a quest to find some ketchup. Next table over? empty. Table next to that? empty. Finally on the 3rd try I pick a winner and can now start to enjoy my burger. Now, I've worked as a waiter and I know it is bad juju to leave empty condiments on the table. Her table, her responsibility. Yeah, shit happens and I could understand if the placed was slammed but it wasn't. Strike3 So, the food was good...burger was nothng special but it was good. I still don't know why we weren't given fries. I might be back but I doubt it unless somehow my daughter can convince me to try again. IMO there are too many restaraunt choices out there to settle for lame service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-peoria-3?start=120

Nicole N.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,67,6,4.0,3/22/2014,"My fiancé and I love red robin, typical dinner date for us. We usually go to the happy valley location and never feel the need to complain. We attended this location last night and it was the 2nd time in a row we walked up to the hostess stand and all hostesses had there backs toward us gossiping, my fiancé had to interrupt them to get there attention and seat us.  The first thing a customer does is walk threw the doors and be greeted, and if that cant be done right the rest of the experience will be negative.  So uncomfortable feeling like we were interrupting there chat session. After we sat down and ordered we watched our onion rings, along with the tables behind us, and another short stack sit under the heat lamp for a honest 15 minutes. After being under the heat lamp for so long there were finally brought to our tables.  Cant speak for the table behind us but they received their appetizer 1 minute before there entrée. Which I would have complained on right then and there. Our appetizers were under the heat lamps for way too long for people not to recognize to run them to their tables so we could have enjoyed our apps in a timely manner.  My fiancé and I were not pleased AT ALL. The only reason this review has 4 stars is because our sever was a SUPERSTAR. His name was Kyle and he made the entire experience 10 times better for us. Always quick on drinks, fries, and great personality.

Brian R.,"Glendale, AZ",26,9,,3.0,7/25/2011,"I've been to this certain Red Robin location several times and the service and food are pretty good.  The burgers are awesome! They have a great selection. My personal favorites are the Whiskey River BBQ Burger and the Burnin' Love Burger. Both of them will not disappoint. If I'm not feeling like a burger, I get the clucks and fries (don't get those words all mixed up when you order, but if you do, its hilarious) I recommend getting that in buffalo style if you want a little spice. It's messy but good. The bottomless steak are a two edged sword. The good news is they're bottomless. The bad news is they're steak fries. I personally am not a fan of steak fries. I'm a shoestring fry kind of guy. They do serve them with honey poppy sauce so that's a plus though.  The food is kind of pricey. Burgers can cost anywhere from $6 to $10 so be sure to bring some cash.  The service is a crap shoot. On some visits I've had amazing service, on others I've had really crappy service. Never in the middle though.  The seating environment is very casual and family friendly. There are TVs everywhere playing sports games. The noise level of the place is kind of loud though.  Red Robin has its ups and downs, but if you're into huge expensive burgers and unlimited steak fries, this place is for you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-peoria-3?start=120
