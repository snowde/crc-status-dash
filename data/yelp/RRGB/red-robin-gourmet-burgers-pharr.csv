Ronald B.,"Vancouver, WA",19,177,13,4.0,11/21/2017,"We still enjoy a RR burger from time to time. We are rarely disappointed. The food was fine, but the service was a bit off. First off we weren't asked if we'd like our burgers with a little pink, as is customary at RR for at least the last decade. After dropping off our food our server was scarce. She did ask if everything was ok, but didn't return. We were finally approached by who I'd guess was the floor manager. He asked how thing were and we asked for a refill on our salads. He left and our salads were brought fairly soon. Our serve showed up between time and we let her know we already spoken and asked for more salad. By this time my drink had been empty for a short time and she offered to refill it as well.  All in all, not the greatest service by our server, but the rest of the staff stepped up and made it right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pharr
Sarah R.,"McAllen, TX",115,67,18,5.0,10/6/2017,I come here a lot & never write review but shout out to the bartender! He's a cool dude! They forgot to put my order in & he made time fly by so it was actually an enjoyable mistake.  The food is always delicious which is why I come so much! Oh & they have vegan friendly burgers which is also cool for my animal-loving friends.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pharr
Stephany C.,"McAllen, TX",21,69,434,4.0,9/22/2017,"Hadn't been here in over a year. As I walked in a noticed that the restaurant was remodeled and was done very nicely.  Went during lunch and was surprised that the meal did not take long.  I ordered their tavern burger, it was a very good burger. Good flavor, good size. I paired the burger with their famous freckled lemonade.  Staff was very attentive even if they were not our waiters.  Overall enjoyed our lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pharr
Noe M.,"Hidalgo, TX",48,132,900,4.0,8/19/2017,"This burger place is a chain restaurant but I can't get enough of their steak fries. Better yet, they are bottomless, meaning that you can have all you can eat fries. The burgers are sizable and you can have them cooked to order. My personal favorite is the Royal Red Robin which comes with an egg inside. The egg is sunny side up but can be made to your liking.  The burgers are customizable as well. I usually remove all veggies, add bacon, and ask for extra mustard. My wife takes advantage of the create-your-own burger if you don't fancy any of the already named burgers on the menu.  For a lighter on calories drink, try their peach tea, which is only 15 calories per drink. For a super great drinkable dessert, try their root beer floats. The root bear floats are one of the few uniq e bottomless drinks the menu offers, which means that you can drink all the root beer floats that you want. Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pharr
Teddy C.,"Brownsville, TX",0,3,,1.0,12/26/2017,"It is one of the worst places to go for dinner. The Place was almost empty, so our dinner should have arrived quickly, but we received half of the order, and then 22 min later, we received the rest of the orders. We were told that it take longer to cook chicken, but what really happened was they lost the order. They were scrabbling to remember the order, but they failed. We talked to the manger, but he was no help, he just handed us his name and name of GM. When we called to file our compliant, it went on deaf ears. No one called us back or emailed us. Please do yourself a favor and spend your money where you are treated with some respect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pharr
Charlie W.,"McAllen, TX",107,58,80,1.0,12/1/2016,"We came here for a late lunch and the place wasn't busy at all. I'll start with the positive aspects I experienced. First was the service, it was very good and the waitress was very attentive and quick on refills and to bring the check. She was also patient while we looked at the menu. Second they have gluten free buns which was a big plus for my wife. It's hard to find a place with good gluten free options.  Now for the downsides of this place. The quality is terrible. It's not really that good, just rather blah. Also it's definitely over priced for quality and size. Burgers aren't very big or thick and the meat is terrible. Prices are definitely too high for the mediocre taste. Also, we came in with a 50% off coupon and it was only honored on one burger, when the coupon clearly stated per table and not per order. This is rather misleading marketing on their part just to get people in the door. Integrity matters so I would NOT recommend this place or come back. If you want a good gourmet burger at a decent price, I recommend Tower Burger in Alamo. Don't waste your money on this place for sub par taste. Great customer service does not outweigh quality or integrity!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pharr
Kristell S.,"Pharr, TX",32,101,616,4.0,5/30/2017,"The food and beer are good.. the only thing bad is that they take forever to bring you the food or drinks. So if you are hungry and expected your food to be served fast, avoid this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pharr

Adolfo Z.,"McAllen, TX",11,20,,4.0,5/13/2017,"Prior to heading to a high school baseball game, we decided to stop and eat a meal.  It had been several months since we stopped by and were looking forward for their burgers.  We have eaten here several times and have yet to be disappointed. This trip was no exception.  The burgers were delivered promptly.  When they arrived they looked just like the picture on the menu.  Taking the first bites into our food, we knew we had made the right choice for our evening meal.  The bottomless fries were hot and fresh.  The wait staff was courteous and prompt.  Our drinks never ran dry and we were checked on throughout our meal to make sure we were not needing any.I will definitely​ stop by again when we are on this part of town.  I highly recommend stopping by and enjoying their burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pharr

They said 20 min wait on reorder of fries. Not waiting on 20 min for fries don't matter if free. Waiters excuse they didn't have enough.

I'm not sure if our server Chris Adams is new or what but I've never had such bad service anywhere else. It took forever to get our drinks and some of us had to ask for them several times but were ignored so other party members asked for us and we finally got them right before the food came out. All the food came out right and was great it's just the service was so bad.

Lou Lou O.,"McAllen, TX",5,80,437,2.0,1/31/2016,This place is what I consider wasted potential (or  untapped potential if you are an optimist). The food is good but not so superior that I want to return. Our waited was really lost so either he is new or not very good. He mixed up my order several times and that is one of my pet peeves from a restaurant (the other one is hot food that is served cold). The onion rings were tasty but it took an act of a managed to get them. So eat there at your own risk.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pharr?start=20
Elizabeth P.,"Pharr, TX",201,138,153,2.0,10/1/2015,"Going to Red Robin's once was a big family treat, both for their burgers and their awesome milk shakes.  It seems, however, that over the last few years, the food quality has declined and the prices have only climbed steadily.  People are friendly at the front door.  However, the wait staff is slow and less than attentive.  Now that we have many more and better options for really good burgers here in our area, I believe we will be trying these places instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pharr?start=20
Brian R.,"Pasadena, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/16/2017,"Most horrible experience. Rude general manager-Alex. Awful service and poor assistance with no urgency to correct the matter. Maria Villegas - Franchisee couldn't be reached by phone. Disgusted and will never return. Do everyone a favor and close the doors. Period!  Saturday July 15, 2017 we go to Red Robin and we notice a banner advertising buy a $25 gift card and get a ticket to War of The Planet of The Apes. This was great because we were planning to see the movie while visiting family in McAllen, TX. We couldn't use the gift card until 6 hours after purchase which was fine. We had a birthday party planned so we couldn't use the tickets until Sunday. We go online to activate the card to get the ticket we get a notice that the ticket will be sent to us in 72 hours. Unacceptable!! Today we return to the same location only to be told they couldn't refund the charge and the general manger Alex was not kind at all. He was rude and condescending saying there's nothing they could do but we could use the gift card but the would not credit the charge.

Cayenne C.,"League City, TX",46,118,9,1.0,7/2/2013,"This place has really gone downhill. They used to have really good burgers and drinks. I hadn't been there in a while--went back--& had a tasteless burger and disgusting cocktail. The waiter said that there was no bartender, so he made the Margarita. 2/3 cheap tequila & 1/3 cheap mixer--no. And charged for a ""top-shelf"" drink. No again. So we gave it a rest, and went back last weekend. After about a year.  Got the new ""Wolverine"" movie inspired burger (don't remember the name), & one of their new ""beer cocktails"" & my husband dared to try another of their Margaritas.  OMG this was BAD. Inedible bad. The burger I had was completely flavorless, in spite of being touted as spicy with ""sriracha onions"".  I've never seen my husband, in almost 25 years, push a cocktail to the side & leave it. He had ordered the ""riblets"", & we did share a laugh as we tried to determine the origin of the said ""riblets"", finally deciding it must be a tie between either rat or possum ""riblets"". The waitress did inquire as to the flavor of my beer cocktail--& didn't seem too surprised when I compared it to drinking hairspray.

Normally I would give slack about service, seeing as I'm a waiter myself, but the service my party received was beyond forgiveness, every single thing that could have gone wrong did! And when we tried to bring it up with the manager she refused to at least apologize and when we made our feelings known she (Amanda) yelled at us, humiliating my party in the middle of the crowded restaurant! Unbelievable. She even called the police because we ""refused to pay"" despite the fact that some of us were already done paying or were in the process of paying out meals. When the police man came he was completely baffled because there was no crime committed, what a waste of pharr p.d's time! I mean honestly she was a real bitch!
