Maria B.,"Sewickley, PA",216,424,227,4.0,12/16/2015,"Like many self-acclaimed foodies, I struggle with giving reviews to national chain restaurants.  But you know what?  Ef it.  Red Robin is SOLID.  I've never had a bad meal here, nor bad service, or been seated at a trashed table or seen the bathroom look like a diaper bomb went off int here, and I've been here during full-on-family-fun-zone-packed-prime-dinner-times and can still say that.  It's one of my favorite places to go before or after catching a movie at the nearby Cinemark.  My only problem is that by the time I polish off half a stack of onion rings and whatever giant burger strikes my fancy, I'm nearly ready to explode by the time I finish chips and start eyeballing those grown-up milkshakes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh?start=20
Jaynie C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,31,,2.0,7/25/2016,"First time I've ever been disappointed in a visit to Red Robin. Our server, Elizabeth, was awful....she was in a huge hurry, was visibly annoyed by a question or request. Asking for crispy fries was an issue, received them barely cooked and she was irritated when they were sent back. We waited almost 40 minutes for a check because she assumed we were using the machine on the table...patty melt was well done when asked for pink and bread was soggy...not a great experience and as much as I like Red Robin, there are way too many other burger places around to be treated as an imposition by your server....if we don't return, it will be due to Elizabeth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh?start=20
Steph S.,"Pottstown, PA",0,2,,2.0,2/25/2017,"If you're into exceedingly slow service, eating your salad that was made with lettuce from last year without utensils, and communicating in a special code where apparently the word ""sprite"" means ""water"", then this is the place for you. But in all honesty, this is just an understaffed chain restaurant. To the people sitting in the booth behind us who were acting like Red Robin might lose one of their Michelin stars because of your screaming complaints: relax. They're doing their best with what they have. You're coming to a Red Robin near the city at 10 o'clock on a Friday night.

Dan K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,14,,4.0,12/19/2016,"Who would think I'd get fantastic Fish & Chips at a burger joint??!!! But, I did! I took a chance since I wasn't in the mood for a burger like the rest of my party--and I'm glad I did! Delicious, crisp, perfectly fried coating and thick, white fish pieces--no ""fishy taste"" whatsoever! Very fresh tasting! I'm impressed! This will be my choice from now on! Everyone was satisfied with their burgers and grilled chicken salad as well! The fries were lukewarm and limp--but that fish made them tolerable! Our waitress was very courteous and efficient--very nice girl! Now, the reason I didn't give five stars? The ""hostess WITHOUT the mostess ""! Terrible personality, not friendly and welcoming as a hostess SHOULD be! We almost turned around and walked out. I tried being friendly and she just glared at us. You know her, the miserable one with the strawberry blond hair. Yeah, you need to lose her or lose customers. Other that her, great experience and great food.

Joe D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",405,549,447,3.0,4/12/2014,"I really, really need to be in a good mood to come to this Red Robin. The burgers are generally very good looking when they arrive. I usually get a veggie burger, knowing their more than likely Morningstar Farms brand and that's my gripe. Red Robin prides themselves on their burgers, toppings, cheeses, and buns. Why not take some of those gourmet burger chefs at corporate and come up with a flavorful meatless burger? I really mind spending 10 bucks on a Morningstar Farms burger that they nuke and toss on a bun.  Three stars for the Speckled Lemonade. Five stars for the quesadilla, it was my go to meal before going meatless.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh?start=20

Burghers And F.,"Coraopolis, PA",0,5,11,5.0,7/12/2015,"Another fantastic visit to Red Robin. My recent trip was on Sunday July 12 at 2100 My wife and I walked in and were seated right away, at a booth in the bar area. Our waitress, Jessica, was prompt with our drink orders and her overall service was fantastic. My go to meal is the Tavern Double with a chocolate milkshake. The burger was warm and juicy and the fries were fresh from the fryer and salted to perfection. I decided to try the Thai Chili sauce with my fries. To me the taste resembles the Thai 'R' Cracker from Quaker Steak, if you like Thai 'R' Cracker give the Thai Chili sauce at Red Robin a try. To finish the meal we ordered the Chocolate Fruffles. These are like eating a fudgy chocolate brownie in stick form. The sea salt dusted on the outside enhances the chocolate taste. I preferred the strawberry jam dipping sauce but my wife preferred the chocolate and we each had the whipped cream as our second favorite, but they are all good. If you go to this location ask for Jessica, her service was fantastic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh?start=20
Courtney B.,"North Myrtle Beach, SC",12,36,20,4.0,5/29/2016,"We haven't eaten here in years. I can't remember why we stopped, because we used to visit quite frequently. I think it made me sick a few times, but that is by no means abnormal for me when it comes to restaurant food, so I won't blame it on Red Robin. We received a gift card so we gave it a go yesterday. My husband chose the bacon cheeseburger and steak fries. I ventured to the new four cheese melt and added turkey to it. I also got steak fries. When the food came out we were shocked at how little food came out! My husband got maybe 10 fries, yes, I know they are bottomless, but bring out enough to fill the plate please! Although tasty, I was left wanting more food after eating my four cheese melt and fries. I got a Nana Nana Moo Moo shake to go and my husband got a vanilla shake-both delicious! I just hate being hungry a few hours after eating out. It's my special meal of the week and I like a lot of food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh?start=20
Sara M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,9,,1.0,8/2/2016,"We've been dining at this Red Robin location for years, with increasingly awful service. We kept going there because our kids love it. But after our last visit this week, when our table had large chunks of a previous diner's food littering the floor under our table, it took forever to receive our food (on a Monday night), our one special request (no onions on a burger) was ignored, and our water glasses sat empty for 10+ minutes with no visits from our waitress... We're finally done with this place and will not be coming back. One of our favorite things about Red Robin used to be the friendly, attentive wait staff. Perhaps it's just this location, but literally 90% of the servers we've had here have been very inattentive and occasionally downright rude. Very disappointing.

I had a small portion of fries and once I ran out the waitress 1. didn't bother to ask if I wanted more, and 2. didn't bother to come see if we were okay to begin with. Then didn't ask us if we wanted dessert, and only asked if I wanted more water before dropping the check.

Jim W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",328,98,56,4.0,8/15/2011,"Not my first visit, just my first review. . .  I had the Burnin' Love Burger this time.  Actually, I have the Burnin' Love Burger just about EVERY time.  Jalapeño coins, salsa, and Pepper-Jack cheese on top of a cayenne-seasoned burger. It's topped with lettuce and fresh tomatoes and served on a jalapeño-cornmeal kaiser roll with chipotle mayo.  And no, i did NOT memorize that list. . . I just C&P'ed from their website. It's a favorite.  If you want a good burger with some imaginative toppings that you won't find just any ol' place, this is the place for you.  The drawback would be the steak fries, which are a little thicker, and not crispy (the way *I* like them) but some people look for that specifically.  I opt for the sweet potato fries instead and am wholly satisfied with my lunch. Staff is friendly/helpful almost to a fault and the manager swings by at some point during every meal to make sure all is well.  I've tried many of the burgers, and while they aren't all equally yummy, I've never had a bad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh?start=20
Kristen H.,"Pittsburgh, PA",257,258,31,4.0,2/6/2013,"Oh Red Robin, I *hate* myself for loving you! Once again, this is absolutely not a four star restaurant but they get four stars from me! I order the Bonsai burger every time.  It's got a grilled pineapple on it, and that makes it healthy--almost like a fruit cup.   I've always had pleasant service here and this is probably one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh to go to if you need to eat out and you've got a picky kid with you. In fact the last time I was here with my then 6 year old cousin, he ordered the chicken strips and then hugged the waitress and told her they were the best thing he had ever had to eat, ever.   While I haven't found Red Robin to be HUG THE WAITRESS good, these burgers are terribly good, and then they are made even better with the basket of endless fries.  The last time I was here I opted for the steamed broccoli as my side instead of the burger. The burgers came out and I took one look at the broccoli, said, 'what was i thinking?"" and then immediately started to steal my friends fries.  Don't be me.  If you're eating at Red Robin your diet for that day is dashed.  Commit to sin, and enjoy yourself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh?start=20
Connie L.,"Germantown, MD",132,237,668,3.0,11/29/2017,"I stopped by for dinner with a colleague on a Wednesday night while working in the area. We arrived before 6 pm and the place wasn't too busy. We were seated immediately at a small booth. Both the hostess and our server, Ashlee, were really friendly. Ashlee was also efficient, getting our orders down and our food out quickly.  I'd been to other Red Robin locations before so there weren't many surprises; the food was tasty but nothing too remarkable. There is a wide variety of burgers, and a small number of options if you want to reduce your caloric intake or want a non-burger entrée. I was able to get pineapple slices on my cheeseburger for just $0.49 extra, which was nice. My coworker got the BLTA croissant with aioli dip for $0.75 extra. If you have a big appetite, the bottomless fries are a bonus. Our total bill came out to be just over $28 after tax and 20% tip (no desserts or drinks). We were able to pay using the pin pad at the table. I had the receipt emailed and it took several minutes to come through, but I did get it eventually. The restaurant was pretty clean and there was a family restroom in addition to men's and ladies' rooms. There was plenty of seating. Overall, a decent place to get a tasty, if average, meal. There was abundant parking in the shopping center in which the restaurant is located.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh
Katie R.,"McKees Rocks, PA",44,37,60,1.0,11/3/2017,"Very disappointed. If you plan on coming here expect for something to be incorrect and slow service. Save your time and money and go somewhere else. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger. It arrived after waiting for 30 minutes and it was black and hard as a rock. Completely burnt and inedible. They remade the burger. I waited another 15-20 minutes and it arrived not burnt this time but without bacon. My husband asked for water twice before we got it. We asked for more sweet potato fries and received regular fries. Lastly, no adjustment was made to my check or even a visit from the manager. I used to be a restaurant manager and in this case I would have visited the table and removed the price of the burger from the check.

Courtney D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",300,101,86,3.0,4/9/2016,"When I think of Red Robin I typically think about a chain family restaurant... My hubby and I came Saturday for an early dinner and there was a HUGE line of people waiting to speak to the hostess. I was initially going to turn around and say ""let's go somewhere else"" but then I remembered, ""hey, we're adults! Bring on the bar!"" Now, I would estimate there were about 20 or so people crammed at the entrance. We went to the bar area and it was half empty . And no kids (sorry for those with kids, but if you want quick service as a group of adults, head to the bar area). The service was pretty good. The bartender got us our beers quickly (not a large selection, but as my husband says you don't go to Red Robin to get wasted... And if you do jump off a cliff). My food was like any other food at the chain. Old reliable. I ordered the teriyaki chicken burger with no mayo and spicy ketchup. It was delicious.  I'm not sure what my husband ordered but his burger came overlooked but he ate it anyway because we didn't want to wait. His plate was all kinds of chopped up. They probably should've tossed it, but instead they served it to him. Will we come back? Sure, but only if we can sit at the bar with no wait.

Back in my Bordo Gordo days I would have happily ate a big fat burger at this place unfortunately my review is going to be based on the cob salad it was actually pretty good I got a side of fries and had a bite of my daughters bacon burger which was delicious!  I kind of wish I had gotten one of those but I'm trying to watch my weight so I landed on the salad. The salad had bacon bits avocado grilled chicken and really fresh lettuce it actually tasted pretty good. I scraped the bacon to the side and had ranch dressing. It was really good, the waiter was really nice I actually ordered a side of fries and they didn't come out right away, when I asked him about it he apologized and said I was trying to wait until the food was ran because I didn't want to charge you for the fries. I thought that was really nice of him. The food came out pretty prompt and the restaurant was really clean.

When it came time to pay, the waitress seemed bothered that we didn't know how to use the 'table monster' and even more annoyed when 2 of us wanted to pay with cash.  This is how they get tipped, correct?  On SERVICE, correct?  I've had better service at York Chinese Buffet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh

Ang T.,"Oakdale, PA",2,137,74,4.0,6/7/2013,"I'm still bitter over Red Robin for taking Salmon off the menu, their Salmon Caesar Salad was soooo good and was such a nice, healthy option. Fish is the only meat that I eat and there are now no healthy options when I don't want a burger, like most restaurants all of their salads have meat on them and the only fish they offer is fried. That being said, Red Robin's birthday burger is one of the best birthday deals that I have found. I do love that I can replace any burger with a Gardenburger. Service has always been good and their happy hour specials are good prices. Great for carry out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh?start=40
Nancy R.,"Atlanta, GA",77,382,2,2.0,6/19/2010,"I've seen the advertisements and was happy when I saw they opened one in Robinson Twp. area. FOOD:  I just had a hamburger without cheese.  Little did I know that they give you onion rings instead of french fries.  The burger looks big, thick and juicy, but when I got it, it was a scrawny piece of meat with pickles and mustard on it.  The onion rings were so good - big and crispy!  After paying ~$8 for it, I thought I can get a similar burger for cheaper at McD.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh?start=40
Michael W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",28,36,54,3.0,7/30/2012,"We go for the chicken sandwich. It's consistently good, so we always know what we are getting. I am a touch upset that they don't have the blackened chicken anymore, but if you request it, they can piece together something similar. The decor is fun and the beers are big. The fries are also bottomless, but just expect small batches at a time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh?start=40
Eric M.,"Follansbee, WV",0,57,,3.0,7/13/2013,"I go here with the wife and son on a fairly regular basis.  The wife always gets the bacon cheeseburger with steaks fries, sometimes with the lettuce wrap, sometimes with the gluten free bun.  It's never a bad meal, usually between good and really good.  I usually get the simply grilled chicken sandwich on the lettuce wrap, I vary my side between the steak fries, sweet potatoe fries, broccoli or the side salad.  The chicken is always cooked well, just lacks a little bit of flavor.  I think it's odd that I have to pay extra for certain sides while not others. We'll go here again in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh?start=40
Darren W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2949,1450,4662,3.0,11/12/2011,"So I came here with Kay and her parents and shockingly DID NOT ORDER A BURGER! Let that cook in your brain for a second.  No, I tried the Riblets and Clucks, an entree that gets you some all-around spiffy  ""microribs"" (nice sauce and tenderness) and some merely passable breaded chicken strips. The ""endless"" fries were as good as when I had them at the Red Robin near South Hills Village months ago, but does anyone order seconds of these, ever? The creamy, timidly tangy cole slaw also agreed with me.  Eh, I should have just gotten a burger. It's great that RR offers a diverse bill of fare, but the Banzai Burger Kay's mom munched on made me envious. Perhaps it was the flour-dusted bun. Yeah, that always does it.  Then again, wrapping it in bakery tissue is a cool touch too.  Damn, I want one now.  P.S. What is it with chains these days and their fascination with kitschy framed posters? It's as if you're in a teenager's bedroom that doubles as a pop culture museum...and a 50's style restaurant. P.P.S. We weren't hungry enough for dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh?start=40
Beth K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",94,68,22,3.0,9/9/2011,"Great service, OK food for a chain.  Fiance hated the shredded lettuce on his cheeseburger, I was pretty happy with the blackened chicken sammy I had. $5 sam adams, little pricey considering it's nothing special. Fries are really yummy. If you are in a hurry in this area this is a decent choice.  Pretty decent salad options, too, if you are watching your diet. My biggest complaint is that my table and menu were kinda sticky, which is par for the course at chain restaurants..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh?start=40

Kayla H.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2,8,11,5.0,10/4/2013,"I absolutely love this place. I've gone here after going horseback riding at Rolling Hills Ranch with a group of my friends. We always go here after riding because we go riding with empty bellies and KNOW we'll be full by the time we leave here. We get seated quickly and waiting wouldn't be a problem with the multiple televisions they have, including the one on the floor! The ambiance and decoration in this restaurant makes you feel like your at home and can see the history and originality of the place. I've tried three burgers, the Whiskey BBQ Burger, the Bacon Burger, and the Cheeseburger. I have ALWAYS had a little pink inside and they had an absolutely incredible taste! The bottomless fries are great, especially with their special seasoning mix right there on the table. I think their new metal container for them is very clever. The waitresses or waiters that we've gotten are usually very nice and friendly, and give us a great attitude and are patient when we are ordering. Though it does take some time for the food to come out, we always get drinks within a short period of time which gives us awhile for some light conversation around the table. I don't mind the food wait, I actually enjoy it. It gives you and your company more time to converse and find creative things to do while waiting. Lovely place to be, absolutely incredible food and great service. Will gladly come back, any day, any time, no matter how busy. This place is worth the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh?start=40
William R.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1,1,,1.0,6/23/2011,Great food and service. The kitchen staff are loud and obnoxious. Very rude and crude. I would not sit anywhere near that area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsburgh?start=40
