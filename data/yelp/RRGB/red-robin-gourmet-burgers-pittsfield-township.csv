Madhurima G.,"Ypsilanti, MI",3,61,116,5.0,11/19/2017,This place is my go to burger place . I love going to Red Robin's. Their service is always top notch . And the burgers are always fantastic . It is a chain restaurant so of course you will not get the touch of local food but they are extremely well maintained location to location . I love their beers . The drink selection is superb. In this location you don't have to worry about the parking also as they have plenty of free parking space . You can have as much French fries you want and those fries are my favorite with ranch sauce. If you are a royalty member then you will get a free birthday burger in your birthday month which is awesome. I love going there again and again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township
MaryLiz S.,"Saline, MI",71,548,2260,5.0,12/9/2016,"Several steps up above the usual drive through grade burger and fries. Instead of the disappointingly skinny, dry fries like Mickey D is producing these days, RR gives you thick steak fries that you can really sink your teeth into. You can have free refills and take your leftover fries home to warm up in the toaster oven the next day.  RR has a lot of great burgers and even slabs of ribs on Friday and Saturday, but I have a restricted diet now, so I really appreciate that RR can let me build my own burger from the list of ingredients in the menu, and give it to me on a gluten free bun - or better yet, wrap it in lettuce for a built in salad. I can get steamed broccoli. French fries are made in a dedicated fryer so there is much less chance of gluten contamination.  The decor is fun and it doesn't seem to get too loud even when it's busy on the weekends for lunch. The staff people have always been great. I am glad to have this dining option in the Carpenter Road area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township
Soleil K.,"Olympia Fields, IL",110,209,705,4.0,10/24/2016,"Came here with my husband and his grandma. It was a Monday during lunch time so it wasn't crowded at all. We were seated quickly, our waiter was nice but slow and very distance, and our food took longer to arrive than expected.  But, the food was delicious, as usual.

Chris G.,"Ypsilanti, MI",34,149,259,2.0,1/13/2017,"""The Applebee's of burgers"". That about sums it up. It's not terrible but also not great. I was hungry and within 100 yards of red Robin, so I decided to try it out. I had not been there in several years so I did not know what to expect.  My mouth was watering while looking at the menu because there were so many tasty sounding choices. And the idea of unlimited fries sounded appealing. The reality was that the burger was average. Too much bun.  The service was poor. And was expensive for what we ordered. I would probably not go back unless it is the only restaurant in town that was open",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township

Melissa C.,"Ypsilanti, MI",37,69,16,5.0,8/29/2016,"Excellent food, excellent service. The pricing is kind of intermediary as far as restaurants go. A burger can be $8-13 depending what you get. They have a full bar which is good for draft, but I'm not too fond of the mixed drinks. It depends on who is bartending. I highly recommend the whisky river BBQ line. They offer a burger, chicken wrap, and a salad and they are quite tasty.  We've never walked out of a red robin hungry, in fact, I think usually we have to take half our food home. But red robin just always really hits the spot for us no matter what we're in the mood for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township

Taylor S.,"Ypsilanti, MI",0,6,,1.0,11/4/2017,"I normally love coming here. Today was a completely different story. Our service was not great at all. I wanted to order a drink and waited around for quite a while but then a different person dropped off our appetizer and took off right after so I decided to drop that. My husbands burger was totally bland. He said the only thing he could taste was the cheese and didn't end up even wanting to finish it. My first batch of fries were cold, which they did replace. And to top that off, I ended up feeling extremely nauseous just 30 minutes after we left. Seems like I may be spending some extra time in the bathroom today...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township
A M.,"Ypsilanti, MI",0,45,16,3.0,2/23/2017,"Let me just say, I really like Red Robin (yummmmmm). If you've been to one, you've been to them all. That being said, a cook or waiter/waitress having an ""off"" day might lead to you having a not so great experience at a restaurant - ANY restaurant... so I won't let the waitress my husband and I had tonight totally jade my opinion on this one.  I've been here before and had great service, the food I've received has been consistently good (the cajun chicken I had tonight was awesome), and I'll go back. They were a bit slow getting our food out to us and the freckled lemonade was more ""regular"" lemonade than what you'd normally expect, but that's not what I took issue with tonight... I was really disappointed and plain irritated with our waitress.  There was an employee having their birthday dinner in the booth behind ours (no big deal), it seemed like every on-the-clock employee came out to check on their friend every couple of minutes (seems like a great work environment, honestly) BUT... could our waitress have stopped to check on us to see if the food was good (it was) or check on refills during one of her trips to check on her coworker? Nope. She walked right past us and around her station over and over again.  I understand people have bad days and I don't expect, or want, to be babysat when I go out to eat - but this girl seemed to have no problem taking care of someone she knew over other patrons.

Pete P.,"Milan, MI",57,329,22,4.0,7/8/2016,Went here for dinner with my son and we had a pretty good time. He ordered the Nacho Crunch burger and I got the Fish & Chips. The service was very friendly and prompt. The food came out super fast!! It was hot and tasty. I thought his burger was a little on the small side but he enjoyed it. The fish & chips were right out of the fryer!! Noise level is on the high side here as the dining room is open as well as music playing on the PA system and TV's spread about. It's a family atmosphere to be sure. A nice visit. I was very satisfied.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township

Allison O.,"Ann Arbor, MI",84,353,151,3.0,5/29/2016,"After a movie date with my mom, she decided she wanted to go to RR for a late lunch. Walk in and it's fairly empty which I would have guessed to have been the case at the time we went. Our server was prompt with our drink and entree orders and they came out in no time. I had the Whisky River BBQ burger, which was good albeit messy. My mom ordered the Black and Bleu burger that had the caramelized onions and blue cheese with a side of onion rings. She too liked her meal but had complete sticker shock to see the burger was $15! I'm sorry but no burger at RR should be $15. Quality does not justify it. Another issue I had was that when the server dropped off our check she set it the midst of a table full of plates and glasses. She couldn't even bother to help clear off the table. All in all, everything was ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township

Greta B.,"Ypsilanti, MI",49,91,391,5.0,5/4/2015,Amazingly fast service on a busy Saturday evening!  Great happy hour drinks and the best burger (southern sweet).  We enjoyed the food immensely with the bottomless fries and fruit.  The margaritas are very tasty as well!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township
Shirley H.,"Moorpark, CA",95,584,600,4.0,4/1/2014,"While I was looking around the web for birthday deals, I came across RR's free burger on your birthday. So about two maybe even a week ago, I signed my hubs up online and a week or so later, he received an email with a coupon for a free burger. We were planning on using it on his birthday, which isn't for a few weeks but I noticed on the email that the coupon is good for the whole month..score! So feeling incredibly lazy again, we decided to go there tonight for an early dinner.  My hubs got the Royale burger, which comes with a fried egg (sunny side up or hard up), bacon, tomatoes, ketchup, pickles and onions. And of course that came with a side of bottomless steak fries. He also got the campfire sauce which had a smokey flavor, as well as the tavern, which seemed to have relish inside. Both tasted pretty tasty but if I had to pick one, I would go for the tavern. It reminded me of In & Outs ""secret"" sauce.  I ended up ordering the Ragin Cajun Chicken sandwich, which came with battered fried chicken, pepper jack cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. I was cravin a chicken sandwich for some time now and this definitely hit the spot! The bun was a little bit too big, but the chicken was big enough that it stuck out on both ends.  I really should and need to pay attention to our servers name because he did an awesome job. Again, another anxiety provoking moment for me is when I've taken a bite of my meal and the waiter/waitress comes up to ask how our food is, while my mouth is full. And our waiter was so good and must've been able to tell because he  walked right pass us as we were chompin away.  One thing we realized about the coupon is, the speciality burgers aren't included in the deal. I believe the speciality burgers are the burgers they advertise either at the front of the hostess stand or in the smaller insert menus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township
C E.,"Ann Arbor Charter Township, MI",0,34,,3.0,4/18/2016,"It's a good place to get a good burger.  I've generally liked the food here and I'm sure I'll be back.  I tried out the ""garlic herb"" fries last time and I was a bit disappointed, though.  It's regular fries with oil splattered on them and an extremely small amount of parsley.  It was honestly laughable.  When I think ""herb fries"" I don't think ""sprinkle a couple parsley leaves on it and call it a day.""  I was expecting a mix of herbs at least.  I would have been happy with just Rosemary.  Or just Oregano.  But just Parsley - kinda gross, in my opinion. Seating has always been immediate and service has been good.  The milkshakes are top-notch.  The burgers are great and even the non-burger options are quite decent.  I've gotten the chicken wraps before and they were good.

Jonathan N.,"Atlanta, GA",9,100,86,4.0,2/20/2016,"Back in the day, RR used to be my go-to for above average burgers and fries. However, now that I have discovered Hopcat happy hour, that is my new go-to. But for those special occasions (FREE birthday burger if you're part of their rewards program), I still come back to RR from time to time. This particular location is very good, top notch for service and food quality.  My personal favorite burger is the banzai, though all the burgers are good. Fries decent too. Their free sauces are nice for dipping stuff. I prefer the campfire sauce. ***Almost forgot: I heard from others in my party that the changing table in the women's restroom is too high!

Annette J.,"Ann Arbor, MI",3093,1398,5037,4.0,6/6/2013,"You know what? 4 stars. There, I said it. I couldn't think of one reason I would give it less than 4 other than it's a chain but that's not enough reason to dock a star. Because for a chain this place is pretty darn good. The other night my fella and I were hitting a movie at Rave and wanted a quick bite to eat. He suggested something along Carpenter. I said I remembered Red Robin burgers being pretty good. He said ""let's do it."" So we did.  It was a Friday night so it was fairly packed (also a local graduation night so lots of celebrating families) but we still easily got a table and were in and our in less than an hour which was good for our tight movie schedule. When we stopped in they were having happy hour which meant super cheap beers (nothing fancy or local but $2 for the likes of a Blue Moon) and 1/2 off apps. I was craving some onion rings so we ordered that crazy onion ring tower which we totally cracked up over when it arrived but we still dug into ravenously when it arrived. Fried, greasy, and oh so bad for you but still so good. I also ordered a burger which was juicy and SUPER filling. Although I still kept eating even though I was full since it was pretty tasty! Admittedly on the ranking of fries steak fries usually fall on my lower end of potato-y faves so I'm not crazy about their bottomless fries but they're good if you're into that sort of thing.  Our server was super nice and really prompt (which was great since we were in a hurry). Prices for regular menu items are a little higher than most other chains but the portions are fairly large, the quality is good, and that happy hour is a great deal as well. Before a movie?

Mia M.,"Canton, MI",69,93,46,2.0,2/12/2014,"I used to really enjoy coming here, but after getting sick three time in a row, I had to let them go.  Red Robin has a great atmosphere! All the artwork is interesting to look at, and I usually find something I haven't looked at yet. It's quirky. This review is coming from a vegetarian that had their favorite appetizer (fried jalapeños) taken from the menu. I moved on to greasy onion rings, or sometimes a tiny serving of spinach artichoke dip and oily and thin tortilla chips. Their garden patty is good, but is greasy regardless of the type of burger you get. Honestly, the burgers are good and creative, but I found myself just eating the bottomless fries after taking a few bites. The service here is great, and they have a good rewards program going on.

We said we were missing something and she had no idea what it was. We finally had to tell her that we never got our appetizer. She blamed it on the expediter that he gave it to someone else.

Food prices are decent, and Red Robin Royalty card perks are surprisingly numerous. The food is quite good for a chain sports bar. I especially like the Whiskey River burger, hot  wings, and chips. Oh, and the tavern sauce is fantastic (kind of like Big Mac sauce). Their fries are unlimited, and they taste good, not great. Dessert is forgettable, unfortunately.  Something that really surprised me is that your burger is properly cooked. If you order a medium-well burger or whatever, thats exactly what you'll get. This location has quite a few televisions and they've always been agreeable to change channels to a Red Wings game when I've asked.

Wally S.,"Ypsilanti, MI",286,274,121,3.0,3/9/2011,"I've always been suspicious of Red Robin.  They have a varied selection of decent burgers, and various other sandwiches and salads. Really nothing to complain about. The prices are a bit on the high side, but when you consider that you have a never ending supply of steak fries (and seasoned salt) at your disposal, the money spent doesn't seem all that bad.   They really get you on the drinks though. The never ending strawberry lemonade is to die for, but they increased the price that it makes you have second thoughts when you order.  We wanted to catch a movies so needed to move quickly through Red Robin so chose to sit at the bar. You know those beautiful conical shaped glasses that Red Robin and some other establishments like to use... Well when sitting at the bar you can actually see how little liquid, be it milk shakes, lemonade or any thing; goes into your glass. What appears to be a 6 or 8 oz. $4 milk shake when it comes off the blender fills one of those tall, conical glasses very well. I've always strayed from buying drinks at RR and now I understand why.  In summary though... decent burger and fries, but stick to the water to save doubling your bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township?start=20
Amelia M.,"Ypsilanti, MI",0,5,1,1.0,4/13/2015,"I love Red Robin's food. The last time that I was in the Red Robin on Carpenter road, I had an issue where I found a hair in my fries. When I brought the issue up to my waiter, he said that he was tired of it happening and he wished that the management would do something about it. The waiter also assured me that the kitchen staff wore hair nets.He took the fries away and expected that to be the last of it. When I was a waitress, my first thought would be to ask if they would like to speak to a manager, especially since this is not the first time. I feel like this incident has turned me away from ordering at the Carpenter road Red Robin again. Their custom service just isn't as good as it is at other Red Robins.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township?start=40
Daron D.,"Ypsilanti Township, MI",53,379,68,5.0,3/25/2013,"I have to be honest, i did not want to give this five stars. Red robin and five stars do not go together at all. Just the name alone is three or four stars, but here are the facts: One of the best happy hours in the Ypsilanti-Ann Arbor area is at red robin ($2 tall drafts, $1.50 well drinks, and 1/2 off all starters, which are all excellent including the wings, which i personally think are a top 5-10 chicken wings in the area and I also think the onion rings here are the best around, like anywhere seriously). The burgers here are pretty good and priced ( i would say the A1 peppercorn, onion onion burger, and tavern are my three personal favorites). The fries here are also good (taken up to another level with the seasoning salt) and bottomless. They also do have free birthday meals when you join there royalty club, and yeah i think red robin is actually consistent all around the board, never had bad service, always great, and yeah all things consider as shockingly as it must be, this is a 5 star place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township?start=40
Chris B.,"Ypsilanti, MI",2,25,,3.0,2/26/2011,"Decent if slightly overpriced burgers. Neverending steak fries are good. My kids love it here as much for the food (especially the kids milkshakes if they've been good) as for the balloons they get on the way out.  The wait staff are always cheery (but lacking 15 pieces of flair) and the food comes out quickly. The place is brightly decorated with the typical doodads on the walls, and it's always clean.  Reliable if predictable. Not gonna light the world on fire, but if you're looking for casual burger type fare then Red Robin is a solid choice. If you want a quiet bistro with no screaming kids or cheesy decor you may want to look elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township?start=40
Julie G.,"Hazel Park, MI",9,92,,3.0,5/4/2014,"Went there with the family to celebrate a big event.  The men in the family are not small people (3 male adults over 6' and 1 senior gentlemen who uses a walker/cane) and they tried to seat us in a very crowded long booth, the kind where the middle pops down.  Not going to happen.  I asked for our party to be moved to a group of tables and they moved a few together for us.  The restaurant seems smaller than most of the Red Robin's that I've been too but it was clean and well furnished.  Our waiter was a nice kid but had the ""deer in the headlights"" kind of look about him.  He forgot some basic requests that we had made like extra salad dressing, refills, etc. but he was fast when reminded.  Food was good--love the bottomless sweet potato fries.  Only disappointment is when one of our party ordered the $14 burger, it was smaller than a McDouble!  I think he took 4 bites and it was gone.  Not worth the new prices.  I would come here again if in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township?start=40
Lisa M.,"Ypsilanti, MI",66,121,31,3.0,6/4/2014,"It's Red Robin, it's not pumping out gourmet dishes but the dishes they do are good. I really like that you can now get unlimited refills of salad or veggies instead of fries. My husband and I eat here regularly as he is on a stricter diet and likes being able to get his chicken sandwich wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun. However there is one waitress at this place who I absolutely refuse to be sat in her section. We've given her a few chances and one of the last times we were there she spent a good 80% of the time flirting with some guys, I'm not sure if she was working on a better tip but it was annoying at best because she was not coming to check on other tables she had. We had to flag down managers and other staff for refills and even our bill. She did not bring out our orders which is normal there because they seem to run out each others but she also did not come back to check if we were okay. As long as the service is better we will continue to come back otherwise we might try another Red Robin in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township?start=40

Nia S.,"Ypsilanti, MI",0,3,,1.0,7/2/2013,"This place used to be really great but the service has declined steadily and I will never go there again. Yesterday I arrived at about 3:00 pm with my sister and her fiance and when we ordered water, she ordered two appetizers: nachos and spinach artichoke dip (both of which are incredibly simple appetizers). I then ordered mac and cheese with salad and my sister and her fiance both ordered soups. These appetizers took literally 15 minutes to come out - they were chips! The server must not have been putting orders in. People were getting their food that came in after us before we got the appetizers. We had told our server that my sister's fiance had to go to work by 4. 3:50 comes and he has to leave, but we still received no other food (which mind you was simple: soups and salad with some mac and cheese that was likely frozen anyway) and our server never checked on us again. I finally had enough and told another server (since ours was nowhere to be found) that we no longer wanted our food. Our server came over, charged us for the appetizers (which was fair because we did eat them), but he was pretty rude about the whole thing and never had his manager rectify it in any way or wonder why a table walked out.  Because this was a slow time of day and everyone else was being served just fine, I really think that a manager should look into it. You've definitely lost my business and I was a regular but this is getting ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township?start=40
Emily M.,"Ypsilanti, MI",0,11,,5.0,6/7/2011,"They have some of the best servers of any restaurant I've been too. I really never would have expected that, but they are always friendly, quick to refill drinks, and some are actually entertaining :) Never had a bad server here! The food is pretty good too. We love the tower of onion rings, and the deep fried zucchini. Also the endless steak fries are great! My favorite burger is the whiskey river bbq burger with a garden burger instead of a real burger (No meat for me! that also means my food always comes out cooked properly. It's pretty difficult to under/over cook a veggie burger)  Great place to go out for dinner any night of the week.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township?start=40
Mitch M.,"East Lansing, MI",93,53,4,4.0,1/6/2010,"I love Red Robin... the food is delicious and you won't pay an arm and a leg.  This is a specifically good restaurant for me because I'm very picky ... if you are too you can try ordering my favorite: The All Natural Chicken Burger It comes with chicken on a bun and everything else on the side.  Also note, the french fries are unlimited -- so eat up!  They have decent desserts too, but my favorite thing is an oreo cookie shake called the Rookie Magic ... they offer two sizes now and unless you're really hungry, the smaller size is sufficient.   I should also note, at this specific location I have never had bad service.  I have been well over 40 times and it really doesn't matter who waits on me.  They are all excellent!  The only real caveat I have to this restaurant is that it can be busy on the weekends and it tends to be more for kids and families... so if you want something kind of dark and quite, this really (really) isn't the place for you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township?start=40

Andrew M.,"Richmond, VA",6,51,,4.0,11/18/2007,"Good burgers, as long as you know what you are getting yourself into. The atmosphere is a little much at times, loud, crowded and cheesy (not the good kind of cheesy, like the burgers they sell).  The burgers (some traditional, others non-traditional) are the reason I've gone back more than once. They are pretty darn good, and more than enough to satisfy just about any carniverous appetite. And there's something to be said for the bottomless basket of fries that comes with each burger. But, I'm usually too full of fried food from the great tower of onion rings to really see how bottomless they are. Caveat: As the previous reviewer mentioned, this place is a bit overstimulating and definitely geared more fun for kids or families with kids. But, since I am always searching for good hamburgers I am willing to put up with it. Those with short tempers or a general dislike of children should probably stay away.

Brittany G.,"Ypsilanti, MI",1,15,5,2.0,4/22/2010,"I went to Red Robin because someone dragged me here. When I went in, I got a Royal Red Robin burger done medium. Our server brought over some fries and our drinks in a timely manner. Now the problem I have with Red Robin is that it looks and feels like a very upscale McDonald's and I'm huge on atmosphere. When I got my burger, it was well, so I did what I always do, and politely sent it back, asking for medium. (Leather meat is not my fav). Our server had the nerve to scoff at me and say that my burger was medium and that I didn't know what medium looked like. She took it away and came back saying that her manager said that the meat had been marinated and it only looked well done, even though upon biting into it,  it was dried out and tough. I didn't argue with her and just ate the freaking burger because all I wanted to do was leave. They took the burger off the bill but I never got an apology or saw a manager. I've never really had a problem with Red Robin until lately when I've been to a few different locations and had a couple of service issues and some overcooked meat. The lack of any consideration and the arguing with the guest really peeved me, so I'll just leave this restaurant chain, not just the one, in the category of ""Worst McDonald's I've ever been to"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township?start=40
