I don't remember what it was called, but I ordered some chicken that came with spices and ranch on top, and salsa and a lime wedge in the side (with the bottomless steak fries) IT WAS AWESOME.

B S.,"Mattawan, MI",0,25,3,1.0,3/12/2010,"Second visit to Red Robin (RR) in as many years when after our first visit Kalamazoo's other Super Burger Chain Restaurant, my preferred choice, Cheeseburger In Paradise closed its doors. Giving RR a second chance we arrived early (4:45 PM.) to beat the dinner rush.  My wife ordered her favorite anywhere, a Margarita and immediately stated it was weak of alcohol. I had a coke which was replenished by our server when low without asking.  I would have had a local brewed Bell's Beer but none available here. Onion Rings were great, they came with 2 sauces just kind of plain, like ranch and a sleepy something like a thousand island dressing with a smokey tint.  Watch your first ring so you don't burn your mouth. These were smokin' fresh from the boiling oil. Tried to spice it up a bit with the large RR brand seasoned salt jar sitting on the table. the first ingredient on its list is salt. I did not notice any other spice taste after that shock, be careful.  I appropriately sliced my sandwich in half to eat, took one bite and it fell apart with the meat falling out into a sloppy mess. Working through that with my fork, I tried the second half and it also slid apart - Looks great in the photo but too much stuff on a bun.  Now after what seemed like a fun thing to do for dinner this night is go to RR, the bill arrives... $39.55 I'm amazed! It was just two sandwiches a coke onion rings and one mixed drink. We would have had better food at Culver's for a third of the cost. I gave the waitress $40.00 cash and she disappears for too long and beyond our desire to stay waiting for her to bring my 0.45 change. We did leave her 15% but she wasn't anything beyond just average. I honestly cannot find the reason this restaurant is so popular every day and how can people afford to spend that much for a hamburger dinner. Further south on Westnedge is a more appropriately priced Culver's as well as one at Exit 72 west bound I-94.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portage?start=20

Josh C.,"Otsego, MI",1,13,3,1.0,3/8/2009,"After having great burgers in many restaurants, I have come to expect and love a tasty burger. When a place like Red Robin has a sign outside saying that their specialty is ""burgers"" and ""spirits,"" I was expecting to have a very good burger and a good, cold beer. To begin my experience, all they had for a beer selection was domestic crap.  I love micro-brewed, or at least a good imported beer, but they only had your typical Budweiser, Miller, etc. I realize this is a national chain, but it would to get some local beers added to their selection. I got a freckled lemonade instead (and that was actually really good). My burger came out later and I have seriously had better burgers at McDonald's. It was one of the worst burgers I've ever had; especially when you consider that it cost about $8.00.

Charles X.,"Cambridge, MA",1,19,,2.0,7/9/2010,At first Red Robin sounds great with their unlimited fries and drinks with a burger. Downside is that service is absolutely abysmal because of this.  Their burgers were decent but nothing amazing. Their fries and onion rings were bland. Note that onion rings cost an additional $1.50 (per serving) more for 5 of them as opposed to unlimited fries. My waiter told me it would be just 25c or 50c.  The freckled lemonade for $4.29 was great.

They have an amazingly fun atmosphere, so much to look at, the music is great and the lighting is simply perfect! If you are here for a dinner with your love, or out with the family. It's always fun and yummy here. Now let's get to the food!! First off, the fries (I'm kind of a fry connoisseur) they are always hot coming out, thick amazingly delicious! My husband ABSOLUTELY LOVES the campfire sauce for dipping, while I love the sweet and spicy ketchup! My kids love the pizza on the childrens menu. I love the rajin Cajun chicken sandwich!! My husband always gets the A1 peppercorn burger! I've tasted it and it's very good, crispy onions on that burger is what makes it in my opinion.  If you sign up online you get a free meal during your birth month! And every time you check in you get points! It's super cool! They have a lot of seating, bathrooms are always kept very clean!  You should probably know they have a GIANT ring of cinnamon sugar doughnuts on this amazing contraption all stacked up! Who doesn't want doughnuts? They also have some ""adult shakes"" I think everyone needs to try!!  If your hankering for a burger  and fries  this is definitely the place to stop!!

Amanda I.,"Kalamazoo, MI",242,358,595,4.0,7/10/2016,"Red Robin is a great option for late night eats. With a full bar and tons of burgers, appetizers, and of course, fries with their infamous at-table seasoning salt. After landing at the Kalamazoo airport I had massive munchies but didn't want fast food so I directed my personal driver/pool boy to take me to Red Robin.  Translation: I asked my husband if he'd take me after he picked me up. I ordered the Burnin' Love burger because apparently I thought heartburn at 3am would be an AMAZING thing to wake up with. But that may have also occurred because I ate not only the roasted jalapeno that was served on top of the burger, but I ordered extra jalapeno coins as well. My husband ordered the bacon cheeseburger. They were both prepared to our liking and tasted great, the fries were a bit soggy and lukewarm but in all fairness we were the jerks that walked in and asked to be seated at 11:31pm.  Because we were there so close to closing we were a bit rushed by our server. She was friendly but also wanted us to order almost immediately after sitting down so I wouldn't recommend you arrive when they have less than an hour before closing. Also, they shut the milkshake machine down before we got there and I had a hard time dealing with that emotionally. First world problems, indeed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portage
Chad H.,"Kalamazoo, MI",8,119,51,3.0,3/7/2017,"I'm glad we have a red robins, but after it's all said and done - it's only average. I always go with a large group which red robins always seems to find difficulty in accommodating - so I highly recommend only going in groups of 4, but probably not greater than 6 unless you're going at an off-hour. As for everything else - it feels very gimmicky - from the atmosphere to their menu to their food presentation. Their burgers aren't bad, though a little tough sometimes. They give you bottomless steak-fries, but I personally dislike steak-fries relative to a nice crispy french fry. You get as many as you want - but they're underwhelming.  Their burger choices are unique, so I'd still say give them a shot if you want a decent burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portage

Mae B.,"Detroit, MI",0,140,169,1.0,3/21/2015,Probably one of the worst restaurant experiences I have had in a very long time. To explain everything that went down would be to write a book. Just know that the staff is very lazy and rude and we'll talk about you while you're sitting right there. They are allowed to do this because the management is not much better. Instead of just apologizing to us the manager brought us all free french fries and free onion rings. My husband said we just want good service.  The waitress did try and did okay. She knew we were treated badly so she got our food to us very quickly.  I've only been to one red Robin in Louisville Kentucky and it was fabulous. This one is awful!  The food was only subpar.

Andrew F.,"Kalamazoo, MI",218,107,62,5.0,9/24/2015,"Red Robin? 5 stars? How could this be?! My history with Red Robin is long, and I've seen the good and the bad. We've been through a lot together, and on the other side of our dark times I've come to appreciate RR for what it is: an excellent choice for a family dinner that isn't going to break the bank, will hopefully have something for everyone, and might just surprise you with some elements of their menu. Let's get right to the crux of the matter: bottomless sides. This is a HUGE thing in RR's favor. If you're going to be a big chain restaurant, there aren't a ton of ways to distinguish yourself. It used to be just unlimited fries, which is cool if you don't mind the calories. However, the bottomless sides have expanded to side salads, steamed broccoli, and other possibly more healthful options. I know ""bottomless"" and ""healthful"" aren't really compatible in the same sentence, but at least I can't eat 2 baskets of fries if I'm busy eating a bunch of roughage! I also want to commend RR for their well-curated menu. It offers you something new every time you come in, often with seasonal flavors, but there is also a core of reliable standbys that you can count on being there if ""Oktoberfestburger"" is not your thing. I will say this: when RR first came to Portage, their standard burger patty was *way* better quality and thicker than what the average burger is now. To get something approximating the original patties, you have to upgrade to one of their premium burgers. That caused a bit of a falling out between RR and me, but like I said before, I've accepted this change and I have learned to love RR, warts and all. I suppose I could write a whole treatise on Red Robin with all of my experience there, but I'll leave it here: pound for pound, a solid restaurant with something for everyone in a fun atmosphere. P.S. Definitely sign up and join their loyalty club...free birthday burger! Seriously we go for every single family member's birthday and free never gets old.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portage

K B.,"Mattawan, MI",9,7,,5.0,4/13/2015,"Red Robin has always been good. When my daughter was diagnosed with Celiac disease we had to quit dining out.  But Red Robin is EXCEPTIONAL at being aware of allergies.  Since this discovery we eat here a couple times a month.  It is one of the few places in town that has an EXCELLENT Allergy Friendly menu!  It is the ONLY place in Kalamazoo that we have found that has a dedicated fryer so she can have Gluten Free/Celiac safe Fries!!!  Many restaurants offering ""Gluten Free"" options are NOT celiac safe.  The service has been GREAT.  Food outstanding.  They are VERY careful and aware of what is safe for her!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portage
