Wasil K.,"Spokane, WA",108,95,337,3.0,7/7/2017,"It would be quite odd if I say that we went to Portland on a long weekend, like a holiday and we ate at Red Robin .. no offence meant to them .. I mean not many people would want to eat at a restaurant chain that too fast food when one of the major part of their holidays is to explore local food joints :( But then, let's say in short, this was the only option left. Yet the good part was I did not ever have a burger from Red Robin .. so I got that goin' for me, which was nice :D Made two mistakes in our order Saw the menu and then the calories that came along with a burger, all of a sudden I started to search for something which would suit my body and not what I had in my mind .. this was the first mistake :D Though the grilled chicken burger was not bad at all .. but I was hoping to have something fried and crunchy and juicy between the buns ..  But what can we say .. my mistake .. not on 'em. The second mistake however was to order the BOCA patty (vegetarian person not vegan .. should have taken the garden burger) .. and I am sorry but our first ever experience with the BOCA patty wasnt a good one, somehow tasted like cardboard :( .. The good part were the sweet potato fries that we asked as sides. The service was good, the boy who was serving us was extremely livid and cheerful and given the restaurant was to be closed as soon as we were walking out, his energy was really something to be seen. All in all,'an average experience which would make me go to them only when circumstances like these come up again .. I mean when there is no other option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland
Frances L.,"Portland, OR",14,210,574,4.0,12/3/2017,"Ok so I gave this location a second shot and I can see they have upped the game a little bit. Being that it's so close to the airport it's always packed, so that aside the burgers are average the fact that they throw in a new one on the menu every now and again makes me interested enough to come back, definitely not my favorite burger joint but the endless fries or in my case salad is the selling point. If I want to take my family out for Burgers this is where we go.  My burger was actually cooked perfectly unlike my previous visits. The bathroom needed some attention and when I mentioned it to the staff it was taken care of. Are waiter was pleasant and made sure to loop by every 10 minutes or so. All in all not a bad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland
Ann N.,"Honolulu, HI",50,329,855,3.0,10/6/2016,"After a long drive back from Salem, all I wanted was a dessert and maybe a drink. I normally don't like to drink and drive with my kid in the car. So having Red Robin across the Hyatt where I'm at, was good.  I was hoping for a pie but there was none (I should've ordered one from the place I had lunch at earlier which looked sooo good). I ended up with a chocolate fudge cake that was topped with ice cream and surrounded by a strawberry puree. I don't like fruit mixed with chocolate but ordered it anyway. It was ok. Super fudgy so luckily my kid ate most of it. I also ordered the sangria. It wasn't super sweet which I like, but it also lacked any booze. Boo hoo. That was the whole point of me ordering a drink - to relax after that long drive. We ordered a side of fries which I cannot resist as they have the Best fries in my book. Yum. Lesson learned: order only fries!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland

Edward W.,"Sparks, NV",2,53,113,3.0,3/15/2017,"Hostess ( Christian) was very pleasant and escorted me to open table with menu. Service was fast and food came out pretty quick. Just a chicken sandwich and fries. I did ask back- up server who brought food for barbecue sauce for fries. Said she would be right back. Never returned. Fries were Luke warm to begin with and after 5 minutes the bartender checked on me and I asked her for the sauce. She was very prompt, but by then fries were cold.  Finished meal and just wanted to head back to hotel. Overall good experience, but the devil is in the details. No lemon for water and then no sauce are the little things I judge my quality of service on. Also, this location you park in the back ( shopping center) and have to walk all the way around to front doors located on Main Street, which is a little inconvenient, especially in the rain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland
Austin H.,"Vancouver, WA",105,35,4,1.0,11/8/2017,"I did a phone order and asked if I could plug in my loyalty number like I have always done. The gentleman named Israel on the phone stated we can't do that here. So, the interaction was not off to a great start. I had an employee go pick up the food as I had ordered it for my staff as a reward meal and they informed me after they ate it that the fries were cold. So disappointing. I will not be using them for any company or personal meals going forward. I just do not get why they are so far from the quality of what their franchise represents with both service and their product. I have gone to many other locations across the West Coast with no issues. Extremely disappointed to say the least.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland

My only disappointment was in my smoke and pepper burger - the bacon was very thin and without taste - like that fake bacon that doesn't need to be refrigerated.

Sarah B.,"Portland, OR",4,7,6,4.0,4/27/2017,"I had a gift card, so my boyfriend and I stopped by last night for dinner. It was national pretzel day, so we decided to order the pretzel bites with beer cheese as an appetizer. When they came out, they weren't really that warm and the middles were still frozen. When we brought it up to the waitress (I didn't catch her name), she was extremely polite and immediately took ours back and brought us an entirely new plate. These ones were almost overcooked, really really crunchy, but they still tasted good, and hey, they weren't cold. I got the guac and bacon burger. I don't remember what my boyfriend got, but I think it was something with BBQ sauce on it. My burger was delicious, and I subbed the steak fries for sweet potato fries and those were great too. My boyfriend also enjoyed his food. He says the garlic aioli was phenomenal.  However, when we ordered, we were very clear that I wanted ranch for my fries and he wanted the garlic aioli. When our food arrived, I had some black peppercorn sauce, and he had my ranch. We pointed this out, and once again the server was extremely polite about it, and brought him his aioli and me another ranch, just in case I didn't want to use the one on his plate. Due to the nature of the mistakes, I'm assuming something was going on back in the kitchen, but it was 8:45 on a Thursday night and they weren't super busy at all, so I'm not sure what the problem was. Finally, when we went to pay, there was a $2 entertainment fee that had been charged to our table, buy we hadn't played any games or anything on the tablet. We had to call the server over and have her override the payment so we could actually pay our bill. She said the previous patrons must have played games, put it on a second tab, and then left without paying for it. Overall: the food was tasty and the server was super polite and nice about the few mix up and mistakes that happened. Will be back in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland
Eric M.,"Kaneohe, HI",59,872,248,4.0,5/12/2017,"A hint: for lunch, go right when they open at 11.  No line at the door and quick order-taking.  Can't say the same by 11:45, when all tables are occupied and there is a waiting list.  Anyway, the food is standard Red Robin fare, which you might think is good or bad depending on how you feel about burgers.  The nice thing is the all-you-can-eat fries.  Upgrades to sweet potato or garlic fries are possible.  My burger came out perfectly but I order mine well done so it is hard to screw it up (just overcook the patty).  Service was excellent at the beginning and only OK at the end, when the restaurant was full.  Thankfully, there is a machine on the table that you can use to pay by credit or gift card on your own.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland
Ed K.,"Honolulu, HI",0,20,,2.0,6/14/2017,"Came in just before 5:00  p.m.  Place was empty. Host told us we would have to wait. I pointed out it was empty. He said the servers weren't ready. I told him to let us sit and wait rather than stand in the door. Tried to seat us at the worst booth in an empty restaurant. I made him seat us somewhere nice.  Waitress was pleasant. Brought me a glass of tea packed with ice and 1 ounce of tea (more on that later).  Loved that the menu offered burgers with no bun and alternatives to fries. Ordered a burger, no bun, and beans, no fries. Drank my 1 ounce of tea.  Pushed the server call button on my table to ask for a refill. She never came. When she brought our food I asked if she saw the call light. She said she did, ""but I figured you hit it by accident.""  I asked for a refill, but no ice. Did she fill my glass? Nope.  She dumped the ice and gave me a glass of warm brewed tea with zero ice.  Sigh.... Burger was cold, on half a bun. Plate had fries and beans. I asked about the fries and was told they forgot so they left them. My guess is they forgot about the bun so just threw out the top.

Erica W.,"Springfield, OR",4929,491,3840,3.0,10/10/2016,"As I get older, I'm coming to loathe chain restaurants for being mediocre and boring. I've been to this particular location with my in-laws a couple times. I think it's relatively close to their house.  The service was ok, nothing really special or memorable. We always show up in a fairly large group, usually 5 adults and possibly a child.  It always seems really noisy when I'm here. Like, no matter what time it is, it's hard to hear people in my group and really relax and chat with them.  Food is fine. With the burgers, they give you the option of pink or no pink. I think they should order them just like steaks, which most restaurants do, but that's my personal opinion. Word to the wise... avoid the tortilla soup. It's beyond gross. My sister in-law raves about it, but wow! I do like the burger with the fried egg on it, and my husband's favorite seems to be the A.1 burger.  I've learned what is good and what is bad enough to tolerate it when I'm dragged here with the family. Would I return on my own? Hell no. It's a chain restaurant in Portland.

Bryan K.,"Vancouver, WA",400,53,2,1.0,8/25/2017,"Been going here for years but had the worst experience of any Red Robin tonight. It took us about 20 mins to get seated. Normal for 7PM on a Friday night. But then it took an additional 15 before a server got our drink orders. Not to mention an additional 10 minutes to get said drinks. But there's more! How is it that your appetizer comes out after your food? I saw the table next to us got their onion rings after the burger as well. What's even worse is that the gal who brought out my clam chowder dropped the bread and didn't even offer a replacement. I suppose the highlight was that the food quality was decent. The fries are atrocious as they were old. I should also say that you better bring your debit card as paying cash seems to inconvenience the staff here.

We were starving at that point, so nibbled on some fries, but had to tell our waitress, cause we are not about to pay and eat for a cold meal after waiting that long. She was really nice and apologized and had the kitchen recook our meal, which came out 15 mins later.  I'm just not a fan overall. All that and the burger still tasted so so. I just got a Bacon Cheese Burger with some onion straws on it. Something like a Five Guys would have tasted better and been cheaper in my opinion. Their fries are still pretty delicious, but I'm going elsewhere for my burger cravings. However, they did take off one of our meals as an apology for serving our food cold, which was unexpected and nice.

I went to this location yesterday for lunch with the family.  Food was as expected and due to the shortage of staff we didn't really get that great of a service.  That's not the issue....... Idiot me, wanting to pay cash so that I can give the waitress cash tip, forgot to put the wallet back into my pocket and just took the change and left. Realizing this after about an hour, I rushed back to the restaurant and looked for the waitress, she immediately recognized me and told me that she found the wallet and took it to the office in the back. I was so excited and was contemplating how much I needed to give her for her heroic act............ About twenty minutes passed when a young manager walked up to me and told me that I needed to give him my contact details as they couldn't find the wallet any more........ WTF? I was shocked....................... To say the least. I actually thought it was joking and told him that I didn't care about the 300 dollars that was in the wallet (210 USD and 90 Canadian dollars as I just came back from Canada) and if he could somehow manage to find my mallet and my credit cards, I would just take it and go.......... Obviously he wasn't joking.... I had him search the office again and he told me nothing turned up...................... Totally unreal and FUxxed UP! GM of this place who supposedly put the wallet on the desk before he left the office told the manager to search all the staffs' purses and bags....... REALLY? Needless to say, my day was spent on canceling my credit cards and bank cards and filling out police report. I know the fault is mine for leaving my wallet there..... And if the waitress told me that she had never seen it... Then I would feel like and idiot and not write this here..... But when the waitress confirmed that she picked it up (actually she told me that she had the bus boy pick it up and bring it to the GM and GM confirmed that he received it from him) and all of a sudden it vanished into the thin air.......  I am so disappointed in the way this management handled this case as they weren't even that apologetic...... Shame on you and what a pathetic customer service mind you have.

Joshua T.,"Phoenix, AZ",445,165,548,4.0,3/23/2015,I don't eat very often at red Robin but when I do I always order the bonzi burger. The bonzi Burger is a very Hawaiian burger with sweet flavor. It's a burger with salads and pineapples on top of it. The burger is huge. Always has such great taste. And all their meals come with free fries. The fries are also unlimited to where you can order as much as you can eat. Normally I order with honey mustard. There honey mustard is the licious compared to other restaurants. Their fries I forgot to mention are one-of-a-kind. There are those along fries that are thick as if you would cut a potato in fifths. I always go out with my friends on Sunday nights to red Robin to relax eat amazing food and enjoy your football game every now and then.

She was the perfect amount of attentive. We each got an IPA and I got the Vegan Boca Burger with sweet potato fries. The burger was cooked decent (rare for a commercial veg burger patty).

Julie E.,"Boise, ID",195,326,264,2.0,9/6/2012,"We stopped at this Red Robin after my brother picked me up at PDX.  We were on the road out to Astoria and needed some dinner.  The parking lot seems small, and it's tough to park a compact car when there are giant SUV's squeezed into the spots.  Also, having a door near the parking lot that makes you weave all through other diners to get to the front desk seems kind of ridiculous- but we shook that off and got seated.  My brother asked to split  a meal with his daughter as she is not a big eater.  He EXPLICITLY asked to use is Red Robin Rewards card for the APPETIZER special.  The other two girls and I ordered our burgers, and away went our server.  Things were a bit busy, so we didn't fuss about having a bit of a wait for our food.  The food was well prepared and enjoyable. But when my brother asked for a refill of fries for his daughter (whom he was sharing with) he was informed (and rather shortly) that it would be $1.99 for a refill since he was sharing with her. He said okay, but as she walked away both he and his daughter mentioned that when they'd been there before, both with and without my sister-in-law that they'd NEVER been charged for more fries when sharing with a child.  We waited in hopes that the manager would come by to check in with us so he could bring it up, but one never arrived. The wait for fries (both for my brother and his girl, and the other girls) was long.  When the server picked up a plate near me she slopped stuff off it onto the table, and barely even apologized (she stained a birthday card that I was waiting to hand my brother. We just generally felt like we weren't paid much attention too, and certainly that we did not get th service we usually see at Red Robin.  My brother meant to email the company, but wound up losing his receipt.  Our server got her tip, but it could have been a much bigger tip had she paid us a it more attention. Oh, and my brothers' rewards card was dinged for his FREE BURGER (which he was saving) rather than the APPETIZER SPECIAL that he asked for.

I wish I had gotten her name because she was probably the nicest person there we came into contact with.

Having been sitting at a nearby table, he arrived with a patronizing smile. We told him of the above and that we were not interested in eating our food and not at that location. He asked if he could remake our meals, to which we promptly declined. We told him of how other locations have often provided a basket of fries for our children to enjoy while we wait for our meals and how this was not offered here. We also told him the cleanliness of the establishment was not of the quality we are used to or expect from the  Red Robin company. The booths had not been cleaned properly after the last guests departed and needed to be swept out, there did not seem to be enough bus staff to provide quality and timely bus services which left many tables dirty and unoccupied.

Well, just continue reading and you'll understand why I would give it only 1 star. After a long evening Christmas shopping, my sister and I decided to stop by Red Robin for a quick bite. Oh how I wish I just crossed the road and went to BWW instead.  While I was walking to the front door from the parking lot, peering in I saw that the dining room was half full. Good, we can get seated and get our food quick. Oh how wrong I was.  The hostess was standing in the front with a smug look on her face when I walked in. I told her it's going to be just the two of us. She looked behind her into the dining room and told us it's going to be a few minutes. A little confused, I just said okay and sat down. Maybe they were trying to figure out their server layout.  About 5 minutes later, the hostess got us and walked us to our seats. My sister and I sat at our seats for about 5 minutes and we already knew what we wanted to order. However, no one stopped by to say hi and they'll be back to get orders in a sec, nor did they get us water before they were off serving other people. We at in our seats for 30 minutes. 30 minutes. Of no one stopping to even say hi. We closed our menus and just sat there waiting for someone to come up and no one did. A bunch of other servers walked by and ignored our ""we're ready"" signal.  When our server FINALLY came by and said hi to us, he acted like us sitting there for 30 minutes was a normal occurrence. We made our orders and he walked away. The food came out about 20 minutes after that. Not only did he get my appetizer order wrong, he ordered the full size when I asked that I only wanted the appetizer size. When he delivered us our burgers, I asked if I can get some sauces on the side. He was gone for 20 minutes before he came back checking on us. I asked if he had our sauces he was startled because he forgot, came back with the wrong sauces and spent another 10 minutes to come back. He then topped off my water, but also topped off my sister's Sprite with water. Great. Thanks for ruining our meals AND our drinks.  I had to consistently remind him we wanted our checks and boxes so we can leave. Our planned hour dinner turned out to be an hour and half fiasco. Before when I worked off of Airport Way, my coworkers and I would always go to this Red Robin with no disappointment. I have no idea what happened. Maybe it was a bad night.

The waitress fixed the order and didn't charge us, but the food took a while and by the time he got his fries, he was no longer interested.

The portions seem very small for a restaurant (especially one that serves mainly comfort food), and it was definitely overpriced. My boyfriend was given two chicken strips and handful of riblets and a handful of fries - which really isn't enough for someone over six feet.

The food is always good and with a very few exceptions the service is at least good.  This particular location provided my family with one of the few exceptions. We came in on a Monday evening around 7pm. The place was probably three-quarters full and didn't seem ""busy"". I've worked as a cook, as a server and as a bartender. This was a so-so Monday night for a chain restaurant in this location. We were greeted immediately and seated in the back. We then waited 15 minutes to be seen by a server and have our drink orders taken. Because we had the time, while waiting, we were ready to order our whole meal at that point. So we did.  15 minutes later, drinks arrive.  20 minutes later our server tells us that our order ""never made it to the kitchen""... and asked us to order again. Which we did.  We've already been here longer than we expected without food and a hungry 3 year old. 20 minutes later our re-ordered food arrived and all was well until it was time to pay the check.  Our check arrives and we're told to use the pay station at the table. Except we can't because our check is wrong (double charged for a couple of items). So, we need a manager, so we wait... ultimately our check is corrected to exactly what was ordered. No offer of discount for inconvenience, no apology. Just a ""here ya go, thanks for coming in"".

Jason A.,"Portland, OR",57,257,16,4.0,9/24/2015,"Stellar location! Normally with a chain restaurant I pick the one closest to me that I usually go to.  I've written a few for the Clackamas location, but this one deserves its own review. Met some friends here for dinner and drinks and we really had a nice time.  Great service, highly attentive and always smiling.  This was the first time in the last six visits to a Red Robin that they got my order right, the food was hot, and we all enjoyed everything.  Super clean location too, including the restrooms which is important to me. It's a very busy location here, near the airport and airport hotels.  Not a lot of eating choices, so flyers know a go-to spot like a Red Robin.  Plus, they bring in the Vancouver crowd that doesn't mind a quick trip over the bridge to save some tax cash.  Overall I was really impressed with the efficiency, speed, and attentiveness of everything.  While I cannot speak for all the locations, this one is far superior to the ones I've been to.  Obviously they've made great strides in hiring good people here, and managers have taken 'process flow' to heart. Negatives?  A few minor things.  As I said they do get busy, and there are times when waiting will be an issue so be prepared or send a friend over early to grab a table like we did.  Also, I am not a fan at all of the new trend in chain restaurants to have the table side electronic order computer.  You can use it to order appetizers, drinks, and you are forced to use it when paying by debit/credit card.  This is where they lose a star from this reviewer.  I find it disrespectful to me as a customer.  There's a reason I'm tipping the wait staff..........for service.  I realize these new computers at the table save money for the company and end up with add-on sales($1.99 to play games), but it's really silly and I don't think it's very nice at all.  However, this did not distract from my experience with my server or my meal to be fair. Overall, great Red Robin, and I wouldn't hesitate to return and suggest it to others.  We were left literally saying, ""Man, that's a good burger"".  A winner in my book!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland?start=20

No refills offered, as we didn't see him after taking our order until food arrived almost an hour later. No apologies or updates offered on progress of food. Took the food to go since I didn't have time to sit and eat at that point. Also, no apologies offered after expressing that it took and excessive amount of time to arrive. As I started to pack my food into the provided to go container, I realized it was ice cold (Bacon cheeseburger lettuce wrap) even the burger patty. For a work lunch, this doesn't work for me.

Chris B.,"Battle Ground, WA",0,20,,2.0,6/19/2017,"Last 3 times a have been to RR it has been bad. This is different locations as well. Since making all of the changes food is much more expensive and quality is way down. $15 Burger I had at this location was sitting in a pool is sauce.  It was so soggy and falling apart I had to use a fork. We ordered a milkshake with appetizer and it can at end of the meal as we were about to leave. When we arrived not busy right when opened. Service was horrible. We waited 20 minutes to get service at our table. Ordered water, iced tea and milkshake. Not difficult. One didn't even show up the tea wasn't even brewed. Since it was so bad we ordered our food while server was there in case she didn't come back.  There were other people who sat down before and ordered at same time as us who never got their food until we were leaving. Lots of tables were seated and ate then left before us and the other table got their food. Then it was crappy. I can get a better burger for Half the price at Wendy's.  Had to ask for silverware and napkins. They served our food without it. Had to get up and find someone to poor water, had to find someone to get fries.  Go back to old ways. Baskets no fry rings which is a joke. Serve good hot food with good service, at a reasonable price.  The atmosphere isn't pleasant either. Save time and money go to any fast food place. Better service and better food, and more appropriately priced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland?start=20

Elle B.,"Junction, Seattle, WA",2,11,,3.0,2/16/2014,"Was seated by a friendly hostess........ Our order was taken by Sara.........she was friendly and when I wanted to try another sauce other than campfire sauce she offered another one in addition to that one - thought that was awesome.  She brought us our drinks. Then one of the line chefs brought my dinner salad out then a totally different person brought out our meal immediately after the salad person.    As I ate a few of the larger fries which were thrown in the basket on top of the much smaller AND hard ones (almost like leftovers) which were underneath the fish I decided to capture Sara's attention and showed her what was in my basket.  She gracefully brought a basket of fries to the table.   Towards the end of our meal a bus person asked if they could take my plate - although I was still biting into my food - what the hell?! Later, Sara asked if we wanted dessert. We said no thank you and that we were ready to go and if we could get the bill.  Sara then brought us a second round of drinks hmmm............not sure what this was all about. I tried to take into consideration that they were  busy but  this location has always been busy when we have visited in the past and never ran into the above.   I am hoping that this was just a fluke and that they are not following the pattern of some of the other Red Robins I have visited recently that started out this way. This is our favorite restaurant to visit while in the Portland area.  Like the old saying goes though................""they're not the only ones"" :) MAYBE THEY NEED A BIGGER FACILITY and  the chefs need to think as if they were the customer ""would I want these skimpy, hard, almost stale fries?""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland?start=80

We each almost immediately downed our water and then had to wait for forever for them to even notice our water was empty. After about 10 mins, they brought out the onion rings we'd ordered and they were completely burnt. But we were just so hungry we didn't care. After another 10 mins they served half of us our food. My mom got her fish and chips and they were completely burnt to the point she couldn't even bite into it. On top of that my dads fries were completely cold and our table and two tables next to us had empty Catsup bottles. The bathrooms were disgusting as well, the trash was overflowing onto the floor and there were paper towels and toilet paper everywhere.

Neither of us knew quite what to expect, kind of like when you go to the clinic after a night with a rather scandalous woman.  Thankfully, this situation turned out wonderfully and exceeded all of our greatest expectations.  We both had the tried and true cheeseburger, their classic.  My friend particularly enjoyed the holder that the fries came in, remarking, ""I would steal this if it weren't so heavy.  It would probably set my bag over the weight limit on my flight home.""  A+ for presentation, Red Robin.  You did good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland?start=80

Food is of course burgers but not feeling like a burger that night, I go with the fish and chips. Fish was average and bordered on dry.

Heidi C.,"Happy Valley, OR",0,7,,2.0,2/19/2016,"Went to Red Robin Cascade Station recently for dinner with our two young boys.  We were seated quickly and received initial drinks and appetizer relatively quickly, and then we sat, and sat, and sat...45 minutes after ordering our food and it still not being out we asked waitress to check on it (she had not noticed how long we had been sitting).  When she checked on it she stated that only half of our order had come up (not sure why she didn't notice it), and the other half was missing and the cook didn't ever see it.  Therefore, the first half that was cooked was now cold.  She stated the manager would come over to talk to us (we though perhaps to give us some credit for the extreme wait time) and cook would make food now and try to rush.  The manager came over and gave us some free fries (like that is a good exchange for our entire dinner being missing), and was on his way again.  We waited probably another 15 minutes for food to be prepared...overall the whole dinner process took about 2 hours, which is ridiculous and unacceptable with two young children.  We won't be frequenting this Red Robin that's for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland?start=100

Sabrina H.,"Vancouver, WA",61,161,5,3.0,4/18/2010,"*Disclaimer* I can actually appreciate Red Robin when I go for something other then their hamburgers. That's right, I go to a burger joint for salads, chicken, or turkey. I always have the worst luck when it comes to Red Robin and how they cook the burgers. I always ask for well done. I would much rather have it be charcoal instead of pink. Can't help it. It makes me afraid. Anyways, it's always pretty rare. One time even there was some blood that ran out of the wrapper of my gourmet burger. No worries though, it didn't happen at this specific location but hey, I don't want to risk it again. I had taken my grammy shopping the other day just because she hardly gets into Portland to take advantage of the whole no tax thing. It was around 11:30 and we could smell something tasty. Grammy also hardly gets to eat out so she was like, ""let's go there"" as she points to RR. I'm not too big of a fan but hey, she has only ever been two or three times to a Vancouver location.  I figured it was going to be really busy since we were there so close to lunch. Instead we got seated right away and they even had a section closed down. I didn't know it was possible for a Red Robin to be slow...possibly because for once I wasn't in the Couve burbs! We had a super nice waiter plus the rest of the staff just seemed super friendly. Maybe it helped that they hadn't been open for very long yet so they weren't so surly with the customers yet but hey, I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt. I advised her to avoid any cow products so she went with the turkey burger and I went with the blackened chicken burger. Both were delicious but then again, we were really hungry.  Best part of the meal -- Grammy has never seen a TV in the floor before. She even almost fell by trying to avoid it while heading to the restroom. She was in awe the rest of the day!

Surprised to see no healthy options section on the menu, like most of these places do, so took a guess on calories and got the bbq chicken wrap with a side salad instead of fries. The wrap was actually pretty decent, but the salad was just iceberg lettuce with one cucumber and two lonely croutons - get some real greens and this coulda been good, folks!

My husband and I eat at Red Robin regularly enough to say we have tried everything on the menu even, their seasonal burgers. We have been to several in the Portland area. I've even been to Red Robins from Florida to Washington State, so I feel as though I know their food well. I also know when their food changes. I ate at this location last week and order my usual Bonsai Burger, I have eaten this burger enough that my palate has memorized the flavor. This visit, the meat was completely different. It was not the typical REAL meaty patty, where they ask you how you want it cooked- it was a pressed, dry, over cooked, rubbery patty that left me with the same after taste as Burger King and McDonald's. It was less than half the normal size and the bread practically swallowed the patty. Typically we are stuffed after our burgers and fries, but we ALL left hungry experiencing the same odd after taste and dissatisfied with the over priced Burger King/McDonald's patty. I don't know if the big change has change owners, or the cost of beef has affected their quality, but this is the kiss of death for me. Paying nearly 11/12$ for a burger that is no better quality than fast food is frustrating and a rip off. I don't know if this change is for good, or just temporary. The fries were also half the order, I don't know if this is to cute down on waste or again a permanent change in quality. While I was dissatisfied with my food, the service was wonderful. I hope this change is temporary, Red Robin is my favorite burger stop.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland?start=120

Fries are steak fries and bottomless.  If you sub a salad for the fries with your meal I have found that they don't completely skimp out on it, it is pretty decent, although not as big as a full size side salad.
