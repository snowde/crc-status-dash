Jerry R.,"Mesa, AZ",5,24,,4.0,10/16/2017,Came here with some friends for a going away party. The food was good and came out hot. The place was clean and not too busy. The service was prompt and our server was nice. The only negative was that the server got the order wrong on a few different occasions. Not sure of it was even his fault and it really wasn't a huge deal. We just had a large party so it slowed us down a little and we were starving. On a positive note they did allow its to bring in our own cake and they did accommodate that. Overall a good experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-prescott
Berenice F.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,15,759,2.0,1/5/2018,Good service! Went in on a weekday night very busy.  These are not gourmet burger.... Not the best burgers in town ... There's better places and for less money,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-prescott
Derek R.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",1,6,1,5.0,9/11/2017,"It started out a nightmare as our server was overwhelmed with other tables and not tending to our table nearly at all. Joe (the mgr) and Jeff (another mgr) came by and took care of my family. That is to say, they went above and beyond to make sure our food was good, fries stayed bottomless and drinks topped off.  I gotta say, for a mgr to do this was awesome. For 2 mgrs to do this is fantastic service. Because of the delayed service in the beginning they comped some of the food without letting us know. When we got the check we were stunned.  My family goes to Red Robin 3-4 times per month. This is why, the above and beyond service to give a great experience. It's not always great, some times it's just good, but never bad. Great job Joe and Jeff!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-prescott
Major B.,"Peoria, AZ",0,18,4,1.0,12/5/2017,"Our first visit to this location, came at about 9pm on a Sat, place was pretty empty. Initially the server greeted us promptly, and took our drink order but then was aloof the rest of our visit when we needed things like drink and fries refills or a check. Had to pay cash because their charge card account went down, got no receipt. Later that night, about 3 hrs later, my son got unusually, and violently ill after consuming a Reds Tavern double burger. It looked a bit undercooked but my son was hungry and gobbled it down. I attribute his vomiting to food mishandling/poisoning by the kitchen staff, probably too busy doing sidework (just like our server) to properly cook and handle food. Not sure if we will be back, as there are lots of burger joints in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-prescott
A F.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",0,21,,1.0,11/15/2017,"It was a Tuesday night, not busy, and it took 20 minutes for them to serve our ice cold hamburgers. So the two main things you might look for in a restaurant, good service and good food, they struck out on both. Also the bartender knew nothing about any of their beers.  This was our second try and will be our last. Why some businesses take their customers' hard-earned  money for granted and provide a terrible product I'll never understand.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-prescott
Roberta P.,"San Jose, CA",136,3,,1.0,11/10/2017,This is the worst Red Robin I have ever been to. The food was cold. The service was awful. I actually had to get up and get my own refill. There was hardly anyone even there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-prescott

Grilled chicken melted in our mouths. Had to take half of it home! I loved that they had so much actual GREEN in their lettuce mix! The only thing we noticed that I gave it 4 stars for is the noise level. It's not a great place for a visiting lunch, but the food was excellent.

Michael L.,"Paulden, AZ",0,1,,2.0,6/6/2017,"RR has really gone downhill. They (Prescott, AZ) must be trying to save overhead by cutting back on wait staff. We said that we would give them three tries and today was the ""strike out"".  Service is beyond slow.  Over the past three visits we have waited an average of 30 minutes before anyone even took our order. One time ghey stuck us in a corner and forgot about us until we complained to the Mgr. Portions have been getting smaller. No problem except prices keep getting higher.  $60.00 for a burger lunch with a couple of draft beers is rediculous. This was it. We will not be returning and recommending to our friends that they try one of the many altetnatives in Prescott.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-prescott

Edee E.,"Hesperia, CA",3,21,14,3.0,7/9/2017,Excellent service. Friendly staff. Great bartender Daniel. Love the fact that they offer alternatives for there burgs. Unfortunately the chef did not get the memo. Served up my bocca burger with bacon. Hmmmm. Could have even given them 4 stars after that had the cook not served the paper from the bocca burger in between the pieces of lettuce. Thank you James the cook on the remake. Daniel displayed frustration. Anyhow I would recommend the Bar and the excellent service provided by Daniel.

She didn't bring the correct item and after mentioning it multiples times never brought it out. At this point we ask for a manger and he uses hand gestures to calm down mlw who was calm about the complaint. Finally when we get our meals with appetizers the food is not hot.

I am very picky with food but i really like their boca vegan patty and am in love with their sweet potato fries. But before i was vegan i engulfed their bacon cheeseburger and was the best.

I haven't been there for two years and at the time use to be great food. I ordered a cheeseburger and fries. As soon as I got my food, the first thing I noticed were the French fries. They were all rock hard and completely dehydrated. I don't even know how you can get That result from fries. And the burger! Oh man!.....as soon as I bit into 1/2 of it, a couple of small BUGS fell out of it! They looked like tiny ear-wig beetles and I could see another one on the lettuce. GROSS! The server left us waiting to get the manager and apologized. They didn't charge us obviously but we didn't just want to sit there and keep waiting feeling sick and just wanting to get the heck out of there. Even if they had offered me a comp or something, I wouldn't have taken it as I will NEVER ever go near that place again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-prescott
Kurt M.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",0,2,,1.0,10/21/2017,We just tried Red Robin in Prescott Arizona again for the first time in 10 years because we stopped eating there due to it being overpriced so we saw the commercial on TV that you can get a 699 Burger and ordered burgers and soda and when the bill came we were again shocked due to the fact that one soda is $2.99 so our bill came to $34 for two burgers two sodas this place is still overpriced and we're not going back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-prescott

Macaron M.,"San Diego, CA",3,11,16,1.0,6/23/2017,"Got the salsa and guacamole appetizer for $7, and they only gave us a tiny square dish with a spoonful of guacamole and the rest salsa... ridiculous! Not to mention the guacamole was brown on top so I had to ask if we could have some fresher guacamole (the servers should look at the food to make sure it's good before they bring it to the table, clearly they did not care). She brought us two tiny dressing-container-sized guacs with the same old guacamole that appeared to have been mixed, as to disguise the brown parts throughout the guacamole... gross! Service wasn't good either- the restaurant only had about three tables for lunch- our waters were constantly empty, and we were not offered for our bottomless fries to be refilled. The server was nice, but seemed really awkward/quiet, and I felt like she just wanted to avoid our table after the whole guacamole situation.

The food was good, as expected (which is the only reason I gave the 2nd star), but the service was almost non-existent. Once we were seated, we waited almost 15 minutes before they asked for our drink order. By then, we had read the menu thoroughly and repeatedly, so we placed our food order as well. Drinks showed up a bit later, but it was half an hour before we saw food! And, speaking of drinks... Refills are unlimited at Red Robin, but only if you can get one. We were there for an hour and I managed to get one refill. I did manage to get a second in a to-go cup as we left. The staff was friendly when we saw them. We just didn't see much of them.

I asked the server if they had pico for my chicken and she said ""no we don't have that here"", I was in question because I have had that dish often and knew it was a miss. My sons burger was burned and his lettuce was brown to, so we asked for the manager and she took our food off the bill and asked if we wanted something to go but we love 4 hours away and declined.

Bill V.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",2,60,19,5.0,2/17/2016,"While out running errands we decided to have dinner on the run... Neither of us felt like cooking and of course the inevitable question ""what do you feel like eating"" came up again - and, I might add, hard as ever to answer.  We happened to be just leaving the mall from as side entrance we seldom use and the ""Red Robin"" sign caught our eye. It's situated in one of those odd little corner lots, kind of off by itself. We have driven past it hundreds of times on the main thoroughfare, Highway 69, without ever paying it any attention. What the heck. Let's do it. The meet, greet, and seat was fast, efficient, and friendly. We were met at the door by a hostess, who quickly showed us to a table and seated us. Our friendly server appeared at our table within a minute. Drinks arrived fairly quickly and we made our dinner order of fish and chips. The food arrived within a reasonable timeframe. Piping hot and cooked to perfection. These were not the standard fare frozen, formed pieces of of fish - all the same size and shape. Instead, there were four chunks of fish, freshly battered and fried to a golden brown. Not greasy, no after taste. Very nice. The fries were also a cut above. At $14.99, a bit pricey for fish and chips, but in my opinion, well worth it.  We left there happy with our choices and very satisfied with the service and quality of the food. We will go back there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-prescott?start=20
Roddy B.,"Prescott, AZ",9,164,323,5.0,2/3/2015,"5 STARS? Yep, we were surprised too.  It had been a few years since we went to Red Robin, and this one in particular. They were always a bit on the pricey side if you were dragging a few kids along. But since this was adults only we thought we try it out. We're glad we did and we'll be back. First, the service was OUTSTANDING. We didn't note the server's name for this review, sadly, as she deserves recognition. She was friendly, fast thorough and very helpful. Drink refills are free and we never once had to ask. When anyone's drink was at 1/4 full, another fresh one would just appear  with Ninja stealth right next to it. Fantastic. All the burgers we tried were top notch, delicious combinations prepared perfectly. Fries were tasty and not greasy; we had four different dipping sauces to go with them. And they were ""unlimited"". The prices here are far more moderate than in years past, too.   We had a great meal, (were completely stuffed) and took a couple small togo boxes with us. 3 meals, appetizer, beverages, tax and decent tip was under $50.  You can't beat it. - I you feel this review is Useful, Funny, or Cool, please check the boxes below.

There were a lot of available tables so we sat down and waited and waited and then we waited some more. A couple that came in quite a while after us sat down and they were greeted right away with menus and offered drinks. Finally, I made eye contact with someone and motioned for her to come over, she asked what we wanted to drink and told someone to grab us menus. At this point, the hostess is now calling our names. Since it was obvious service was going to be horrific in the bar area we had her take us to a table in the dining room.  Little did we know we were going to wait and wait and then wait some more in the dining room as well. Nothing was efficient, it was slow, exhausting and frankly a huge waste of time. I don't know if our ticket got lost or our server just didn't put our order in right away but we waited close to 50 MINUTES just to get a burger and a chicken sandwich. Keep in mind, this was after we were told he'd be right with us and after waiting for drinks and then waiting again to order.  The whole 2 hour experience was painful. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is the food came out the way we ordered it, I didn't have high hopes.  We come to Prescott a lot and will definitely not be returning to Red Robin!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-prescott?start=40

Elizabeth C.,"Waddy, KY",20,260,585,3.0,10/22/2012,Had been here before a couple times years back... Atmosphere is always lively and fun.  My BBQ Burger was great.   However.. hubby ordered the Tavern Double and it was not as advertised.  Instead of 2 full burger patties they just cut one in half and give you two super thin patties.  The burger was seriously smaller than a whopper and had less toppings... So.. if you love burgers it's worth a shot... but... meh!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-prescott?start=40
Jaswant A. S.,"San Diego, CA",37,577,427,4.0,4/27/2015,"So we were driving about in Prescott - came for a festival that ended up being cancelled due to rain. Bummer. We were all underdressed for the cool weather so we decided to go someplace for dinner and the driver chose Red Robin because she had been craving a Red Robin burger since forever. Ok. I'm not into chains - not the kind they put on you while you work on the highway in orange jumpsuits and not the kind that distribute bland slop to the masses. But I went along with it. Nice big parking lot for this one. We were seated right away. Waitress brought us drinks right away and we ordered. I was curious about the Fiery Ghost Tavern Double with ghost pepper sauce, pepperhack cheese and fried and fresh jalapanos. I asked the waitress if it was real ghost pepper ""man vs food"" challenge kinda hot. She replied that some guy that came in earlier that day could only eat half of it. Hmmm. Not good enough. I need statistics - how many carried away by the meat wagon in critical condition? I mean this Ghost Pepper stuff is all the rage these days - Popeyes has Ghost Pepper Wings, Wendy's has Ghost Pepper Fries, and Jack In The Box has the Blazin' Chicken Sandwich with Ghost Pepper Sauce. I'm afraid, though, that these emperors have no clothes - it's all just smoke and mirrors. What they try to market as the wild and dangerous culinary equivalent of skydiving is actually just a wimpy sauce that wouldn't even make a bedwetting four-year-old break a sweat. So I get my ""Fiery Ghost"" burger and bite into it and my suspicions were confirmed.  I imagine someone in the legal department probably put down his cigar for a second and shouted ""We can't kill off our customers - that would be bad for business!"" So they came up with a rule that every Fiery Ghost sandwich would get exactly one drop of the ghost pepper sauce spread throughout the entire burger. You can taste the ghost pepper but it won't bite back - it's safe for the masses. Don't get me wrong - it wasn't a bad burger but just call it a regular burger with added traces of spice. So the waitress came back and asked if I wanted any dessert. Usually the answer is no. This time I was curious - I drink Blue Moon often - you know, the one with a slice of orange in it? Well these guys make a Blue Moon shake. I couldn't decided if that really sounded good or not but I just HAD to try it. So I tried it and it was actually really good. Much better than I imagined. The actual proportion of Blue Moon seemed very little - just so you get the flavor but most of it was milkshake and there was also some Cointreau in it. You won't get drunk off this though, lol. Since it is a tasty shake exclusive to Red Robin I'll probably be back again to a Red Robin somewhere once in a blue moon for a Blue Moon Shake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-prescott?start=40

Brett M.,"Gilbert, AZ",4,14,2,1.0,5/24/2015,"We were in town and picked Red Robin because my son wanted it. The beer was over carbonated and was just gross.

Cat S.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",14,14,4,1.0,7/8/2013,"I saw a disheveled server grab a handful of food, shove it in her mouth, LICK all her fingers, then walk into the kitchen. She was munching on a half eaten cake sitting (covered) next to the pass. Maybe some sort of staff celebration earlier in the day? In any case, it was disgusting. She looked right at me as she licked her fingers in full view of guests. YUCK!  The worst part...several minutes later I saw her waiting on a table of fire fighters. Sure hope she washed her hands!  Aside from that absolutely disgusting display, this was a typical Red Robin. I just couldn't get over that waitress shoveling food in her mouth with her bare hands. It pretty much ruined my otherwise pleasant experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-prescott?start=40

After 40 minutes and still not having anyone come to our table, we left. Very disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-prescott?start=40

Peppercorn burger protein style... Smaller order of onion rings Coffee It was nice to get my burger ala protein style. I didn't even think before to ask RR if they lettuce wrapped their burgers. I didn't see it on the menu, so I'm glad I asked this time.  And I was craving onion rings, but didn't want any large monstrous tower o' rings for just me. So that was nice to see a smaller version on the menu.  As far as it being loud.... it certainly wasn't on a Sunday afternoon. And come on - -it's Red Robin! You expect there to be a lively atmosphere and a couple obnoxious ""Happy Happy Birthday"" songs to be going off at the same time.  But I had a great experience here.

Our waiter, Derek, was excellent, keeping us refilled on everything without asking, even after they got very busy. My Southern Charm burger, a new addition to the menu, was fantastic. My wife's burger was done exactly to her specifications. She wants her burger with absolutely no pink, and she has sent back many an order because of this. But she said this one was perfect.

Faye E.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,13,,1.0,7/30/2014,"On a mission for lunch with the kiddos (15 and 18). First restaurant we went to was packed so we decided to try Red Robin. Greeted and sat immediately. 20 MINUTES LATER a server came by to tell us another server would be with us in a minute. 10 MINUTES later said server arrived asking for our drink order and saying she couldn't take our food order because she didn't have a pen on her. Kiddo's drinks came about 8 minutes later and she took our food order. 15 minutes after ordering wine, the bartender brought it over. We had been seated for almost an hour when our food came....in shifts. My son's fries and fruit salad and my daughter's and my chicken wrap. 10 minutes later my son's sandwich came out along with my daughter's and my fries. Check was dropped quickly with the comment that she hated helping other servers because it always seemed to hurt her; I had my credit card in hand and we were out the door in about 1.5 hrs for lunch. My children hate it when I complain in restaurants so I stayed quiet. I worked in a restaurant for 9 years so I understand getting busy and I try to cut servers some slack - but this restaurant was not busy - less than half full. Food was what I would expect to order and pay half as much for at a small diner. I went online to complete their survey and apparently they don't want too many details as there is not a section for ""Comments."" I guess my many ""strongly disagree"" responses will have to suffice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-prescott?start=60
Jerry C.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",0,8,,4.0,2/3/2014,"As a rule I don't review chain restaurants and in an area where mediocrity is the standard I have found an absolute diamond in the rough. Derek  the server at Red Robin in Prescott, AZ is worth the visit, even if you don't care for good hamburgers Derek really knows how to treat the regulars and everyone is a regular to Derek. His quick wit and attention to detail are unbelievable.  He knows the menu, unlike too many ""server"" in the Prescott area and he will honestly tell you if something isn't up to par on a particular day. He is an absolute joy to have serve you. And when you leave, Derek will most often wave and say, ""see you tomorrow ."" It is refreshing to know that there is good service out there. Maybe it is just Derek's personality that make him perfect for this job but every server should be taught that a smile, listening to the customer, knowing the menu and attention to detail are the basics for food service or just come to Red Robin some night and watch Derek work. It might explain why he always receives good tips. It's like the old saying, he does this the old fashion way - he earns them.

Andy G.,"Ithaca, NY",245,445,10,3.0,8/15/2011,"Overall this is just adequate--it's the same as any other Red Robin you might go in to. That's probably what they were gunning for, so I guess that's a win for Red Robin. Basically you can expect friendly, efficient service, and a menu full of things that are mildly creative and absolutely awful for you. I bet there's not a burger on the menu that comes in under 1000 calories. Oh, and stay away from the sauteed mushroom burger.

Dana M.,"Hemet, CA",4,14,,1.0,7/6/2014,"We visited Sat. night of Rodeo Week in July. The place was crowded when we got there about 6:40 PM complete with a 3-4 year old's temper tantrum at a near by table. However, we were seated right away (table for 5) and our order was taken in good time. However, we waited over an hour for our food. By the time we got our order the restaurant was far less crowded. My husband's and my order was delivered incorrectly. His order was to be Monster style and my dish was to come with a choice of fruit salad or fries. I received neither (come to think of it the waitress didn't ask me about my choices!) When my husband questioned the waitress she quipped ""I brought what you ordered!"" She then offered to add another patty onto his burger and brought me a basket of fries. Taken aback by her confrontational  behavior,  my husband opted to simply eat his disappointing burger-Frankly, her impertinent attitude put a damper on our meal. We chose RR as a place to celebrate a family gathering. I didn't appreciate the waitress' unprofessional demeanor nor her serving style of constantly reaching across the table instead of going to each person at the table to serve or collect plates and fill drinks. I have been to this store before and have usually received cheerful and efficient service. Never have we been snapped at by wait staff-furthermore we are frequent RR customers in both CA and AZ. We spent $62.00 for this experience. After we returned to our hotel, I examined the receipt and I confirmed that the waitress logged the order in wrong. My husband ordered what he gets every time. We came to RR to celebrate-instead, we got a green worm attitude. I'll think twice before coming to this store again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-prescott?start=60
