Tessa B.,"Tacoma, WA",0,13,1,1.0,12/17/2016,I used to love this Red Robin but the fact that they now serve 12 fries per burger is so stingy!   We're talking about potatoes people. I understand cutting back due to costs but when you charge the same amount as Burger King it might be time to increase your menu prices by a dollar. In the hour that the four of us were there we were never offered refills on our drinks and the three dirty tables next to us never got bussed. It was about 4 p.m. and not very busy. Management needs to highly consider revamping their game plan. There's a Brewery next door and people are not going to come back if there is an alternative. Save your money and go to Herfy's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-puyallup?start=20
Laqrisha H.,"Tacoma, WA",0,8,,5.0,3/31/2017,Great food and service. The fries are my favorite with sweet and spicy ketchup and smoked bacon. Excellent. The French onion soup and their burgers are delicious.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-puyallup?start=20
Tiffany M.,"Crestview, FL",0,32,,5.0,2/17/2017,"We went in around 11 when they opened and received the best service and best food we have every had. Only problems were that the floors felt slippery (the worker said it was a problem with the type of floor they had installed during a remodel...) and the women's bathroom was disgusting.

Mica J.,"Auburn, WA",47,3,,1.0,12/26/2016,"Poor service!! Wait was expected. But the second we sat down, 1st thing we were told was there were not soft drinks or lemonade. So it was either water, shakes or smoothies.  My husband got a shake, and was mostly whip cream and cookies and very little ice cream....probably because it's all they had to serve. Then it took about 45 min to an hour to get our food, which was not even fresh!! Cold fries, room temp burgers. We didn't even bother to eat, we just walked out. Considering, we are a family who rarely goes out to eat, we are extremely disappointed on our outing to to Red Robin Puyallup",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-puyallup?start=20
Ken S.,"Puyallup, WA",0,17,1,2.0,1/2/2017,"What happened to the Bird?  Haven't been to Red Robin in a while. The burger selection is still great but bottomless fries?  How about starting with a full order. If you want to prevent waste-maybe ask ""hey you guys like a lot of fries?""  Then after someone asks for more-go get the order.  It is fries- not a steak ""cooked to order""-You should always have tons ready, especially if you advertise ""bottomless"".   Not sure of other locations but the outside of the men's bathroom door looks like it came from a Union 76 gas station just off the freeway.  General appearance was cleanliness isn't job #1.  The black plate my burger was presented on had more greasy fingerprints then the back windows of a mini-van.  The place was packed and the staff was busy. One more suggestion-get rid of the automation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-puyallup?start=20

Norym O.,"Tacoma, WA",35,6,3,2.0,4/7/2017,"I'd give this 3 stars but the server, Telysha, was very unhelpful and abrasive. I went with my grandma. And her being elderly would typically need a little more assistance and explanations that she didn't even attempt to offer. She was very shorthanded with her answers and very standoffish. I would definitely point out to not ask for her as a server when arriving, if I ever come back again. The service was just so bad. She even was talking bad about other patrons, as well as us, just one table away. So unprofessional and a bad attitude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-puyallup?start=20
Rob S.,"Puyallup, WA",11,5,,2.0,11/27/2016,Slow afternoon very slow service waitresses fine but she couldn't deliver the food any faster than the kitchen prepared it. I was very disappointed because my wedgy burger set under the warming light for a long time. I could tell because my salad was all wilted and warm in the burger was not hot.

Smaly K.,"Tacoma, WA",110,420,1551,3.0,11/10/2015,"Food was average, same as all the other Red Robins I've been to.  But I would say I like the service here the least, although my sister says the service is horrible in Lakewood, which I haven't been to that one yet.  We did get our order pretty quickly, but our waitress didn't come check on us for a while, which would have been okay if we weren't in need of fries refills.  We finally were able to ask for refills, and when she brought more fries, she just dropped the fries off and quickly walked away.  But she stacked the metal baskets of fries on top of each other, which we felt was kind of weird.  We don't know how clean these baskets really are.  It's like ordering two plates of food, and it comes out with one plate of food sitting on another plate of food.  I don't know, maybe it's not a big deal, but we didn't like it too much.  It took a while to get her to come back after we finished; we pushed the ""Call Server"" button on the little machine on the table, but that didn't do any good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-puyallup?start=20

Burger ordered medium, my wife's ordered medium-well.  Not sure why they ask.  They're all burnt to a crisp.  That includes the kids burger - a hockey puck of a Boca burger on a burned bun. I suppose that's why it took 45 minutes to get our food - you can't cook that thoroughly in less time. For some reason they are super busy, so I'll let others keep them in business.

Shelly C.,"Spanaway, WA",12,17,2,1.0,5/22/2016,"I probably shouldn't do this while I am still so furious, but I'm going to. I came here with my family, party of nine. Gave my name, and sat to wait. They called my name, we gathered our things, and watched them sit an entirely different party of nine that had JUST walked in the door. I pointed out the error. Even though they had not all made it to MY table, they CONTINUED to seat them and we had to wait. So now I'm sitting on a bump, crammed in a booth, by the kitchen, on my very last visit here. Oh gee. Someone broke a glass in the kitchen. And now my ears are ringing on top of it.  Sigh. The asswipes at my table? Nice and peaceful and relaxed. Hey Teal party of nine? Red Robin? You suck.

Alekkz H.,"Seattle, WA",507,559,1042,4.0,1/8/2013,"This was a so-so experience. The waitress was quite nice which gets points! Since I did choose to come during the dinner rush. I however... will keep in mnd for next time that Red Robin has quite a handful of kids dining in, so it was really loud and annoying. I ordered the Chicken Bruschetta Burger? My mom and sister shared the Veggie Burger? It was my first time trying the Chicken Bruschetta and I have to say, the bread was delicious! The chicken was chicken breast but it wasn't dry and tough!(: However, the salsa that comes inside had diced tomatoes and I asked our waitress to put it on the side but she forgot I think. I was a bit disappointed since tomatoes are somewhat disgusting to eat. However, I put some ketchup on my chicken breast and tasted sp much better. I love their fries! Yum yum yum. No need to talk on and on about the fries everyone comes to love. I tried the St. Louis Pie? With strawberries and honestly, it looked unappetizing. But dang, it tasted quite good!

Jamie T.,"Tacoma, WA",31,5,,1.0,11/5/2016,"No reservations allowed but they encourage ""call aheads"" which is what our  party did for a group of 20 for a birthday Friday night. Everything was good to go for 6:30pm, arrived at 6:10 and the hostess told 3 different people in our party 3 different wait times, 20 min, 45 min and 1 hour. The planner of the birthday dinner was irritated and told the hostess we were probably going to go somewhere else but within a minute or 2 let her know we were all going to wait it out. 1 hour goes by and still no table so we asked how much longer we might expect to be waiting and they told us they sat a table of 10 in front of us and it was going to be at least another 45 min. We had going hungry kids with us and there was no way we were going to be able to wait and hour and 45 min for a table we had called ahead on so we asked to speak with a manager. The only thing he said was that earlier when we had suggested we might go somewhere else then changed our mind and stayed that put us back at the bottom of the waiting list.. I work in customer service and I've never in my life made a complaint but this was handled so inappropriately I had to say something. I haven't ever really had an issue here before but I'll never be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-puyallup?start=20
Remylynn M.,"Shoreline, WA",20,41,28,4.0,3/16/2015,"Walked into this place around 8pm on a Sunday night.. Business was slow.. Maybe only 4 or so tables were filled. Anyway, when we arrived.. No host was at the front to have us seated. Another party of two males walk in.. The host walks out from the corner and instead of being courteous and asking who arrived first, she automatically took the two guys to go get seated. My blood boiled.. Because excuse me honey, we live in this country where racism still exists.. How do you think it looks (professionally, culturally, and sociologically) if your white ass seats white boys before brown people?! I was so irritated by the lack of courtesy and professionalism. Those two boys could have said something too. I was too shocked to have experienced this for the first time.. So I bit my tongue. I would have given this place less stars if it wasn't for one of the best customer service I have ever received from the waitor. He was so exceptional!! It reminded me of like southern hospitality.. He took our order, referred to me as ma'am and my boyfriend as sir, checked back on us to see if we needed anything else and if the food was cooked to perfection, served us bottomless fries without asking... He was just so great!!  Our burgers were cooked to perfection! I swear, I looked at my boyfriend's burger when Ryan placed it down, then I looked at my food.. Took a bite of fries.. And when I looked back at my boyfriend.. Half of his burger was gone LOL it was that ""yummmm""  Before leaving, I wrote down comments about the host and our waitor (Ryan) on the back of a receipt.. I hope it got to their manager or supervisor. We definitely will be back to this specific location because of Ryan's customer service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-puyallup?start=20

The kids burger was big for her, she is 11. The fries are big and fresh. I had the burger with avocado let me tell you it was the best.  She always gets a free sundae for her bday and the bday song by the staff.  They are so friendly and cheerful everytime. Kids can get a balloon too.  I love the decor, it is pretty American like. I love the music they play and is not so loud, also they have televisions everywhere with sports on. The area is spacious and clean.  The parking should not be difficult since is right in the mall area, so there should be plenty for you. They also have take out so if you don't like eat there you can order to-go.

Rudy B.,"Puyallup, WA",33,4,,1.0,11/3/2017,"Tried out Red Robin Curbside. The sign says no unbuckling required, just call. Apparently they don't have phones here because it just rings forever and nobody picks up. Whenever they say your food will be ready, just add another 30% time on it and that's when it will be ready.

Charles M.,"Renton, WA",0,70,162,4.0,5/4/2017,"Stopped in after shopping at the mall on Saturday April 29th.  It was fairly busy, but we were seated right away.  My wife and I were both very hungry, but took some time to figure out what we wanted to order.  Our server was Katie M.  and she was very patient with us.  I had asked if the promotion that we received emails about for Royalty members of spend $10 get a free appetizer was limited.  She informed us it was not, it included any appetizer.  This only prolonged our decision but we finally decided on ordering nachos, and boneless wings in addition to my Royal Red Robin burger and my wife's fish and chips.  After placing our order, we sat over 20 minutes with still no appetizers. The manager had noticed my wife's displeasure and came over to ask if everything was ok.  She told him NO I'M hungry and we still don't have our appetizers.  He said he'd look into it. He went back to the kitchen. A few minutes later he came back with our appetizers and apologized.  Immediately afterward he came back with our entrees.  We hadn't even started to eat the appetizers yet! He again apologized and said there was a bit of mix up in the kitchen so everything came out at once.  The manager said he'd take them back to the kitchen and have some new ones made up but brought out after a little while so we'd have a chance to eat the appetizers without the entrees getting cold.  He came back and check on us after we got out entrees.   I'd have to say this is the first Red Robin were I've seen the manager actually working the floor during peek hours and ensuring guests are having a good experience. So Kudos to him.  The food in general was good, but the manager's willingness to take care of his customer's was refreshing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-puyallup

Service was quick and we had put in our order and got our food in no time. I am addicted to the burning love burger here and can't seem to push myself to try something else. I always order mine well done. However, my burger came out burnt. The charred outside of my burger was really bitter and left an unpleasant after taste in my mouth.

Kristi L.,"Tacoma, WA",0,44,61,2.0,1/21/2017,"Sadly...this RR has seen better days. Compared  to the other restaurants in extremely close proximity this restaurant is capital F ..Filthy!  Just gross. We arrived maybe 45 minutes after they opened and we were seated quickly..in a booth with a shredded seat and some touch screen game thing sitting on each table...which I thought was pretty cool. We ordered and then I booked it to the bathroom to wash my hands as we had just been to BestBuy and I was touching the game controllers and couldn't stop thinking about the snot nosed kids who also touched those same controllers and I need to wash my hands asap and defiantly before eating. Aahhh the bathrooms....why is the floor so grimy..Jesus I went in there to wash my hands and feel like I may have ended up do more harm than good...why is there black stuff on the grout around the toilet...oh gawd what's splattered up the walls and why...why does the little hand plate on the door that instructs you to wash your hands before leaving soooo filthy? I think to my self...don't touch anything..go straight to your table. They just opened but there are gobs of shoe prints on the tile floor...like someone is moping with old mop water. The floors, bathroom and walls all need a good scrub and steaming..it's just gas station bathroom grimy. This only leaves me to wonder ... WTF does the Kitchen look like?!?! Surprising part is the photos on the wall did not have a inch of dust on them that you would expect to see along with the other conditions.  Food was good....the ""plastic"" plate was water spotted with greasy finger prints..and hubby's Bonsai burger wasn't wrapped in the paper wrap...like they use to be???

Lauren P.,"Kent, WA",697,737,373,4.0,5/9/2016,"I seriously have been boycotting RR for TWO YEARS because of an awful fry mishap that happened waaaay back in 2014 at the Covington RR. However, my grandma and aunt wanted to do Mom's Day lunch here, so I reluctantly obliged. It's kind of unfair of me to give a review of the service here - my uncle is one of the managers and he waited on us, and my cousin is one of the bus boys. So, I mean, I think the service is fantastic and you're lucky to have either Christian or Scott working with you. ;)  I ended up getting the Avo Cobb O salad - avocado, grilled chicken breast, and bacon. It was pretty tasty and the chicken was really good, but I only had a few pieces of avocado. With its name having to do with avocado, I thought I'd get more  (and I'm an avocado fiend). I also tried the Raspberry Cream Soda and it was DELICIOUS but pretty sweet so I was only able to have one. Fried pickles are delicious as well.

Mel S.,"Lakewood, WA",3,58,245,2.0,4/3/2016,"The interior of this Red Robins is spectacular! Everything is nice clean and energizing. Service in my opinion, was alright. I was not happy with the fact that they do not have Tabasco sauce. What burger joint doesn't have Tabasco sauce?? Good thing I carry some in my bag (swag). As for the prices; I honestly feel like they nickel and dime you for everything. They have special sauces that come in an extremely small single serve cup for .75 which is not practical at all. They have games on the table tablets, but your going to pay $1.99 per. Over prices appetizers for such a small portion.  I recommend the Blu Ribbon Burger with a turkey burger, instead of beef. Ps: you can sub turkey, chicken, or veggie burgers for all burgers. No extra cost :)  Also: I've been to other Red Robins before, and by far this one gave the smallest portion of ""bottomless"" fries. I mean you can get 3 portions of their fries and its equal or less than 1 order of fries anywhere else. Very skimp on the fries.  This place is kid friendly for sure and the kids menu is decent.

I was sitting under a TV caked with dust.  Gross Red Robin delivers a surprisingly a-ok experience, but falls short when you view the limited menu with prices on the high side.  The Burgers are sloppy, and drips from the sides of the bun and can be difficult to eat, however very tasty.  The steak fries are large, and with dipping sauce can taste great. The sevice was average, but edged on the extremely better side of average. The gourmet burgers are just that an upper level burgers you will not find at most burger establishments.

Adri M.,"Puyallup, WA",7,8,9,2.0,5/14/2015,"This last Saturday, after a fun day at the beach I was craving Red Robbin. I figured it wouldn't be too busy around 8:30 so we headed in. It wasn't too packed in there so we thought we had lucked out. We were told it would be a 20-25 minute wait to be seated. My 5 year old was with me or we would have opted for the bar. I was shocked and asked why. The hostess said they were short servers and only had 4 servers at the time. I should have listened to my gut and went to BJ's next door. We only waited about 10 minutes for a seat. We knew what we wanted already, so we ordered everything as soon as we saw our waitress Ashley, which was only a few minutes after sitting down. I still had high hopes. We waited 25 minutes for our beverages. With a thirsty 5 year old. I gave him my phone after 15 minutes to buy some peace. The manager saw us and guiltily brought over a basket of fries. Still nothing to drink. Finally our appetizer came out and still no drinks. I had to ask our poor waitress again just for water. There were 3 of us, but only 2 waters. My drink that I ordered was a lemon drop. It was awful and I should have asked for a better vodka but I didn't. Seriously gross. I didn't complain about it because it's their choice to use cheap crappy vodka and I should have asked. My husband ordered the clam chowder. It was half full and dry, as though it was the bottom of the pot. We did ask for it to be taken off. The burger and fries were amazing and thank goodness for that. Watching our waitress literally run, work her butt off and do it with a smile was impressive. Ashley was amazing and the order issues and drink problems were from lack of staff. I'm shocked that her manager let the staff go on a Saturday night. I could tell as he waited on tables he knew he made a bad decision. Yes, one that ruined several people's dining experience. On a sunny Washington Saturday, it's going to be slow until the sun goes down. It doesn't mean cut your staff. Was saving money worth a bad yelp review?

The food is what you expect from every Red Robin, but for the sake of discussion, I will add my meal with my SECRET TRICK!! First, start off and order the Riblets and Mac n' Cheese. In my opinion, the adults Mac n' Cheese sucks, so this one time I asked if I could get the kids kind instead. Now that, boys and girls, is some good Macaroni and Cheese. And the best part is that kids' plate IS REFILLABLE AT NO CHARGE! Bottomless Mac and Cheese you can eat, give to your kid, bring home, or whatever at no charge! Woo Hoo!

The vibe I picked up from our waitress Ali was just chaotic. she seemed so irritated with a simple drink order which made me uneasy and this was our first impression. So we ordered our drinks and an appetizer ( bottomless fries) she came back with drinks and left to put in our order.. She came back with chips salsa and guacamole(in which I'm very allergic to)we told her we had ordered fries and was so upset she cut us off and said""apologize I'll get the fries"" and left in a huff. Finally after watching her have such a hard time imputing our order she came back and brought our fries STACKED on top of each other.. these are the baskets that they place on the counters on tables and where they hold them to serve..she stacked them on the fresh fries (gross) by this time I was to hungry to care I ate them anyways. So we finished the bottomless fries and a few sodas and she was in the back trying to figure out what was going on with the order and since we could see what she was putting in we knew she had the order wrong...well we pushed the call button  no one ever came back we figured she was so frustrated at everything maybe she quit??? So now I'm thinking well... Wth? THAT was the turning point of our visit. Next thing I knew I saw a beautiful smile ask""are you guys doing ok?"" Preneycia (Precee) of course we said no and she FIXED the whole visit she was so in tune with her job(customer service) that she SAVED this place from a 1 and a horrible review.

Anyway, the MO of Red Robin is your basic American burger joint with a handfull of other items.  The Onion Rings are good - golden crispy.  Their campfire sauce is pretty good as well - it comes with the onions.  I like the California Chicken Burger.  My favorite part is the fries, they are the broad steak fries, they also have their own seasoning salt on the table...it's pretty good.

I ordered the a1 peppercorn burger with a side of the bacon sauce the waitress brought out our food and my sauce was wrong song let her know and she went back and brought me back the same sauce I already had. She said the cooks didn't know what sauce I was talking about. I showed her a picture in the menu and she took it back again waited about 6 minutes before she came back with the right sauce. Then after taking a couple bites of my burger I tasted paper.. I spit out what was in my mouth and sure enough some paper.. I took apart the half of my burger I had left and the cook left the paper on the cheese.. There were black burn marks in the edges of it.. I was pissed..

Melanie V.,"Henderson, NV",96,94,9,3.0,9/3/2014,"Red Robin, as anyone who knows me, is my absolute favorite restaurant. Ever. So I was excited when I visited family, and we decided to head over to Red Robin for dinner. Yum! We were immediately seated when we got there, no wait. The server was very nice, making little suggestions such as closing the blinds if needed. Not always typical. Service was average on the other hand. Our server took our drinks, and asked my mom if she wanted sweetener for her tea. She asked for sugar. Drinks are brought out, no sweetener. We then had to track someone down to bring it. We then ordered. We requested the appetizer onion rings. They came, and we weren't given any napkins or silverware. We had to track someone down for a second time to bring it. Gets pretty annoying having to ask for things in a sit down establishment that should be automatic or brought the first time. My baby was also in a sling with her car seat, and was bumped twice by servers. I really didn't want her woken up. The food was good as always.

If I want to sit in an uncomfortable booth with people all around me and no kind of sound barriers, I will eat at the local hospital cafeteria.  Our server was the best part of the experience. She was attentive, refilled our drinks, offered ranch for our fries, etc. The food was a little slow to arrive, but with drinks and a football game on, we managed. Now for the food. My son's meal of clucks and shrimp was one cluck shy of being just a cluck. I have never seen two smaller chicken strips at a restaurant. No seriously, these things could go to duel with a fishstick and lose. The shrimps were okay, but with about six on the plate, it left the proteins severely underrepresented.  He even ate the coleslaw, just to try to feel full.  My burger was delicious. I am not complaining about quality, just quantity. If it wasn't for the bottomless fries, I would have complained. But I don't find value in being filled up with fried cheap carbs.  When I pay $50 plus a tip for three people, I want to walk away feeling good about it. In this visit, I didn't.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-puyallup?start=60

Food came out quickly and about 30 minutes after my burger, I started to feel a little queasy.  I never got to the groaning stage, but it gave me a bit of a scare.   I can't get excited about this place, but I didn't expect to walk out looking for antacids later on after the meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-puyallup?start=60

Tonight however, we ordered food the way we usually do, Hamburgers in a lettuce wrap.  They came to us with so little lettuce that I must have looked shocked.  The french fries were certainly not generous.  These were the reasons we came to eat at Red Robin.  We'll be rethinking our dinner plans next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-puyallup?start=60
Yen E.,"DuPont, WA",174,394,328,4.0,3/18/2013,"Red Robiiiiiin Yum!  For awhile, I wanted Red Robin all the time, but mainly for their endless fries.  On my last visit, my husband ordered a beer and we usually use our military ID.  They usually just look at his birthday and hand it back, but for some reason, our waitress had to TAKE IT and show it to her manager.  Which was really odd and she was gone for a good 5 minutes with it.  So, never do that.  Our waitress was nice and all, but she was practically whispering while talking to us.  Maybe she was new.  Food was great though and came pretty quick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-puyallup?start=60

Sometimes it's really good and sometimes it's so, so. I do like that they give you a fee burger on the month of your birthday, they give a free Sunday as well. How can you pass that up? I also like that they encourage you to dip your fries in other sauces besides ketchup and ranch.

dustin g.,"Puyallup, WA",22,228,133,4.0,11/29/2012,"I stayed away from this place for a solid two years or so, maybe longer. I wasn't impressed with most of my visits and in general, wasn't a place I wanted to spend my money. After hearing they were bringing in Sweet Potato fries, I figured I would give them a shot. So my girlfriend and I went in and let them try to pass the test, lol.  Well, long story short, we've been back multiple times. We pretty much only go to the bar and while there have been a few 3 star visits, overall, we prefer it over most places in the area. We enjoy the bottomless fries, the reward club is decent and they have angry orchard on tap. We go once every two weeks or so and no plans to change that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-puyallup?start=60

The last few times we were in it seemed the entire inside of the building had been replaced, including the staff. Where are all the happy employees? Now it's a bunch of people walking around like robots who don't enjoy their jobs. That has an effect on the atmosphere and the taste of the food as well. We could tell when your chef took pride in his work, now it's just like any other burger place. We'll sadly continue to drive past and find other places for dinner.

Marie M.,"Sumner, WA",790,78,,3.0,1/20/2012,"I have went to Red Robin many times and the one thing you can count on is their consistency. They have very good burgers, and endless fries. If you are not a fan of french fries you can get a side salad instead at no extra charge. There is no doubt though, for burgers the prices here are pretty high. Strawberry lemonade sure seems to be popular, and I know those type of drinks, like soda, ice tea, lemonade etc, are endless with constant refills. All of there burgers are cooked medium well ( 155 degrees ) If you want them cooked any differently, you will need to let your server know. The fish and chips are very good considering they specialize in burgers.  The restaurant is very lively and inviting with bright colors all around you. When I flew to Washington last month, I brought my grandson and daughter here for dinner. They always give each child  a child's menu with a few color crayons to use that have mazes, things to color etc. Usually they also give kids balloons upon request, In December, we were told that they had a national shortage of helium, so they were unable to give out any at that time This place seems packed each and every time we go there and if your not trying to watch your pennies, then I think you will really enjoy the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-puyallup?start=60

Nope, still disappointed!!  Table of 10 and we sat down to a carpet full of crumbs from past guest, table super sticky and the booth seat smell like the bleach rag was a month old mop rag, Ugggg!  Drinks arrived quickly.  Food delivered and had to send 2 meals back because special instructions for food was not followed.  Not trying be picky but a big difference when lactose intolerant!!  Make that three plates that have failed!!  The tortilla on the BBQ Whiskey wrap was hard as a rock, the kitchen crew has imploded!!  The manager took that wrap meal off and 25% but now......Wow, this review is in real time.... The burger that was sent back because of mayo (that was requested from the get go to NOT have mayo) was resent and guess what, mayo again!!  It's been a year since eating here and after this 2nd debacle, we're calling it quits.  RIP BBQ Whiskey wrap, I will miss you!

It's a slightly overpriced burger with bottomless fries. I will always enjoy the dirty bird when I go, but it always reminds me of being in high school and feeling like a cool kid, sitting there pestering the server for more fries, honey mustard sauce, and then going outside to join the ""original dirty bird,"" if you've seen the original buildings famous painting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-puyallup?start=60

Paul T. K.,"Washington, DC",23,54,7,3.0,5/7/2009,"When in doubt, Red Robin is always a good option.  This is typical burger chain fair in a slightly more upscale fashion.  There're about 20 separate burger options (though with customizations this is pretty much limitless), along with a few pastas, salads, and other fried foods (onion rings, mozzarella sticks, etc). Red Robin isn't so much about the food, though.  When you go here, you're most likely going because you know you're going to get decent-to-above-average service, a clean restaurant, a family-friendly atmosphere, and consistency in taste. Nothing spectacular, but nothing to push you away.  This is just another average American chain restaurant in the middle of suburbia.  It's relatively mindless, but that's what makes it easy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-puyallup?start=100
Tina C.,"Federal Way, WA",41,133,10,1.0,11/10/2014,"Server was sweet, but took our order and only saw her after she delivered appetizer for kids and drinks 45 minutes into our dine in. Then 30 more minutes to get our meals, then we needed to switch seats, got some overgrown oaf treat my kids poorly, so I politely (trying to role model for this idiot) asked to move. We were told to move our own things and food as it was too hard for her to carry to the empty table in a non-busy day. Then she got smart with the teenager, never came back for refills, ahppy to drop off bill, had to fetch another server to run teh bill. Called and emailed to complain, got Kristen who said she needed to check it out and never heard from her again. Yet I called last night after sending 2 emails to guest relation and called them only to hear Kristen told them it was covered and a GC was issued. Um, really???? To Whom? Not I. Today I got a message from Kristen. I guess I am going to have to avoid this place. This location is horrible. After seeing reviews, I'm not the only one who had this crap experience.

Daniel H.,"Bonney Lake, WA",39,1,,1.0,3/1/2014,"VERY POOR SERVICE! Our experience started out with the server coming to our table twice saying hello and she would be right with us. After ordering we had several other servers bring us food for other tables 3 different times, including once after we were done eating... After getting our foods it just got worse from there, waited for 20 minutes for our check, when the server finally came back she told us she brought our check to a different table and they paid it. She then asked us if we would mind paying for thier food so she didnt have to get the manager.  30 minutes later we finally got our correct check. The manager walked by our table, when we asked about the check she immediately left when the server approached our table offer no reasoning as to the confusion.  Very disappointed by the service and the management.

Delilah R.,"Seattle, WA",139,451,56,3.0,8/11/2008,"I've been to Red Robin in general over a dozen times.  Mostly, it's been due to either the lack of options or because someone I'm with is in want of a horribly bad for you meaty burger.  Voila, I find myself at this location two weeks ago as the result of a mix between the aforementioned reasons. Have you ever, EVER taken the time to taste JUST the patty?  No sauces, no additives, no veggies...just the meat?  Do it.  What you will find is a vast taste of bland poorly seasoned beef.  I never actually realized that aspect until my most recent visit to the RR here in South Hill.  I guess they're doing fine as is as far as incoming business goes, but should things start going down hill I suggest RR revamps their hours to mirror that of Denny's.  Drunk people hardly suspect, or even care about the taste of what they're consuming so in the most desperate case RR would be in the clear.  Just sayin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-puyallup?start=100

They messed up the birthday boys order as well as the other two kids orders. They neglected to tell us that they were out of oranges and just assumed apples would be fine, which they werent as my son hates apples. We shared our fries instead. My burger was on the bland side. To finish it all we had four separate bills and my party of four was the only bill that had automatic gratuity charged to it for 7.50.
