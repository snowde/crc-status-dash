Michael W.,"Raleigh, NC",1,13,14,3.0,10/8/2017,"Similar experience from other Yelpers, no hostess to greet us when we came in.  A server happened to walk by and seat us - turned out to be our server.  We have been coming to this location for about 9 years and things are really starting to decline.  I used to think a lot of reviews were unfair for this place - you have to temper your expectations a bit with all the crazy screaming kids.  But server attentiveness has declined (Not sure if it is the table tablet computers our not) and the cleanliness of the location has plummeted.  The baby changing station in the women's bathroom needs dire need of a wipedown and cleaning. But why a three?  The food is still decent and that has not wavered.  I do ask management to be more reasonable in how they staff and to focus more on customer experience to push this location back up to a four where it should be and stay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-raleigh

Heather B.,"Wake Forest, NC",3,153,382,1.0,9/6/2017,"To management - hire pleasant employees for your hosting area and actually have servers come by tables of PAYING CUSTOMERS.  I know, it's s crazy idea but your customers won't walk out IF a server actually comes by the tables!  We were rather rudely greeted at your location by a not very friendly hostess, waited at a two top booth for 10 minutes for a server.  Any server.  None showed.  We got up and left.  Mentioned to your surly hostess on way out that we were never approached by a server.   Heads up - you lost out on a $40 lunch tab.  And, your reviews on Yelp are awful.  Might want to reassess what y'all are you doing wrong.

Kat G.,"Raleigh, NC",1,54,158,2.0,10/1/2017,"Red Robin is our sit down burger place. I have been to this location a handful of times and I keep thinking management will be better. As always there is no hostess to greet you. Tonight there were 3 families waiting and complaining. The bartender alerted a waitress who looked less than pleased to also be a hostess. We were seated and waited a few minutes until a waiter showed up.  The restaurant was definitely understaffed, waited a while for the app and food. We ordered chicken wings as an appetizer but turned out the ran out. We ate, got our check and realized bill was as wrong. The beer was listed as 3.50 and we were charged 6.50. Took a while for the waiter to show and fix problem. I think having the touch screen system makes it hard to locate the waiter and service sucks. We had to ask another waitress for our waiter in order to get refills too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-raleigh

It's awesome! This location is huge! It has a lot of seating!

Tonight they "" lost"" our order , told us that after we were waiting 30 minutes and then it took another 25 minutes to get food out. Food was lukewarm, didnt want to send back cause who knows how much longer it would take . When we are finally served the waitress didnt even apologize for the wait. Others around us who came in later were served earlier. We hadnt been here for awhile and there are plenty of other choices in the area.

Stephen Y.,"Oak Ridge, NC",21,92,67,2.0,7/23/2017,"I don't have anything against Red Robin or their food, but the service at this particular location is very poor. After our party of six was seated, no one came to take our drink orders for about 15 minutes. By that time, we were ready to order. Food took an additional 30 minutes to reach the table, and the waiter serving the food forgot which one of the identical burgers that me and my friend ordered was cooked medium and which was cooked medium-rare, so he just guessed. The waitress who initially took our orders was barely present throughout the experience. Theoretically, fries are bottomless at Red Robin, but service was so slow that we only received one refill. Our waters we also only refilled once throughout the meal. Overall, the flavor of the food really wasn't bad, but the lackluster service took away from the experience. I'd most likely avoid this location in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-raleigh

This time the hostess seemed annoyed she had to be bothered by us and the server took his time getting to us to get drinks and take the order. However the food came out in a decent time.  The noise level was typical....loud.  The fries were not as good as usual. They were less tasteful even with quite a bit of the seasoned salt on them. The Whiskey BBQ seemed to have too much lettuce and not much chicken. The Turkey Burger was good.  I'd still recommend them when the fries are better. The food is usually pretty good.

Tony J.,"Morrisville, NC",13,188,189,4.0,1/14/2017,"Went on a Saturday night. They were pretty busy and larger parties have to wait, but I got in pretty easily. Their burgers are decent... better than fast food, but not quite as good as real restaurant burgers, but their bottom-less fries with the seasoning is pretty darn good. Drink and dessert selection is not too bad either. Food came out reasonably quick, although it did take them a little while to refill my fries. I pretty much only go to Red Robin because the free birthday burger they give to rewards members. If you sign up for their rewards program, you get a free burger during the month of your birthday, every year.

I was taught that if a business fails so does your need for employment.  But let's face it, they don't care. Good luck with that. My experience in the last year with franchise restaurants has been horrible. It will only be a matter of time. I left my phone in the car, because I feel it's rude to talk while in a business.

I'd rather you take back the good and I'll spend my $12 on a pizza that would st least full me up!

The food was VERY mediocre, lets add insult to injury, the waiter just seemed very distracted so much so other staff had to help.

Kelly F.,"Raleigh, NC",0,1,,1.0,10/14/2017,"This is my first time writing a yelp review, but my experience at Red Robin made me feel as if I needed to. We walked in and were seated fairly quickly, but no one had come to greet us or get our drink order for about 10 to 15 minutes. We brushed it off when the waiter finally came over because he apologized and thanked us for our patience. We immediately asked for a drink and bottomless fries. He went to put that order in and came back to take our dinner order. About 25 to 30 minutes pass by and we still had not received our fries. We politely asked the waiter if we could get those fries and he said that the kitchen was running behind. He came back a few minutes later with the smallest plate with maybe 7 fries on it. Our food came out shortly after which was mediocre, if even.  The first thing we noticed when we walked in to Red Robin was the dessert trio that was advertised all over, which consisted of an oreo sundae, chocolate covered brownie sticks, and donuts. We never order dessert, but it looked so good that we had to get it. Another 15 to 20 minutes pass by before we actually got our dessert. A lady brought it out and it had the tiniest donuts, the brownie sticks, and a bowl of crushed up oreos. I told the lady that we were supposed to have the trio with the ice cream sundae, so she took it back. She came back out with the exact same bowl of crushed up oreos, but with soft serve ice cream sloppily poured on top. Still no toppings on it. Literally just ice cream and crushed oreos, no hot fudge, whip cream or cherry. It looked absolutely NOTHING like the picture. McDonald's provides a much better sundae and it looks 100 times better than what we were given. We asked to speak to the manager, who didn't seem very sympathetic, but took the dessert off of our tab. We told him we didn't want the dessert and just wanted the check. I normally don't get offended easily, but the experience was degrading in the way they served the food like we wouldn't notice. We will NOT be going back to any Red Robin after this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-raleigh?start=20

Michelle S.,"Durham, NC",59,61,16,2.0,7/30/2017,"Red Robin is choking!!! I believe Red Robin is not as good as what it used to be. Here's why...service is okay, not overly friendly, especially for the price of their food. I get it, a little, as a former server of a burger joint. The cup of soup that cost $5 and was extremely small and took (13 literal bites) is hardly what I would expect to pay. The size of the cup was laughable and a bit appalling. Burgers are always good, but the ""all you can eat fries"" is not enough to keep me going here. I'm sitting at the bar and a carryout order came in to place an order and waited ten minutes and still no one came, so she decided to go elsewhere. The bartender did tell her that someone would be there to take the order, but no one came. It's a bit of a shame and I can't say I will be back. I feel for $11 a burger, I can go someplace happier, with better and fast service than this place. I've currently waited over thirty minutes for a burger .

DJ M.,"Raleigh, NC",17,48,22,1.0,7/10/2015,"Thank you to Red Robin for allowing me to pay for my last $10 burger. I will not being doing so any longer - especially at this location. Preface: I love Red Robin's burgers (especially the Royal Red) and I have been to this location in the past. However, after this last visit I felt the need to share my experiences. My party arrived on a slow Monday night at 7pm. Seated right away. Drinks came fast (except for a root beer float) - then absolutely nothing.....crickets.....chirp chirp. Took 45 minutes to get our food - just a few burgers nothing special. Food temp was questionable. Drink refills were nonexistent. Service was the same.  Red Robin no longer serves their messy burgers wrapped up in baskets. Instead they place them unwrapped on fancy plates because they want to compete outside of their specialty with other nicer restaurants. That makes eating such burgers even more complicated and not what I am looking for when I want a greasy burger. Their fries portions are the same size as one would find in a Happy Meal. Forget ordering another round as that will be another half hour wait time - as if they should not expect customers to ask for more of the ""bottomless"" fries. Not worth the average cost of $15 person. Love the Royal Red but I can add an egg to my burger at home. For eating out, I will stick to the Dollar Menu, Cookout, or Five Guys if I want to splurge a bit. At least I know what I will get from each of these, like them all, and will save some coin along the way.

Let's get on with this spawn if Satan already. -- Okay so number one the restaurant wasn't even full it didn't have more then about 6 family's. -- Considering the amount of people in the restaurant you would think that the service would be better but hahahah your wrong. -- It took us 20 minutes just to get our drinks AFTER REMINDING THEM MORE THAN 2 TIMES -- After around 2 hours we finally get our meals. My sister didn't get her meal. When we start eating the food is medium cold. Not hot but not cold. But wait it gets better -- After 20 minutes of waiting for my sisters food the manager I guess came up and told my sister ""Sorry we ran out of the materials to make the food...what would you like it's free on the house"" -- My sister tells the man that she doesn't know what she wants then tells him to comeback in 5 minutes. -- 5x5=25 ""25"" is the amount of time it took for him to comeback.

My husband and I went there right before his flight. We were seated right away. From there, the service went downhill. Our waitress left our drinks empty the entire meal. She also avoided us until she put down the bill. The burgers aren't great. The only redeeming quality is the bottomless fries, except the waitress hid from us the entire meal and gave us the bill as we asked for more fries.

Pens M.,"Raleigh, NC",31,3,,1.0,4/9/2016,"After several unsavory experiences with the Wake Forest location, we decided to travel out of our way to go to this Brier Creek location instead.  We've been going to these Red Robin locations for several years.  From now on, however, we will not be going to Red Robin ever again.  At both locations, we've experienced less than impressive results. Our final encounter with Red Robin (Sat, 2016 April 2--at this location in Brier Creek) was horrendous:  The waiter was nice but consistently incompetent:  He lost our Rewards card and after leaving us hanging with avoidance tactics, we had to call him over and ask what he was doing about our lost card.  He mumbled something about getting an answer from the manager, disappeared, and eventually the manager showed up with requests for us to look through our belongings.  We had already done so--to a ridiculous extent, as the waiter knew, having gone through that routine with us already.   I informed both the waiter and the manager that after we gave the waiter our rewards card, he went away and came back only with the receipt listing our rewards status.  No card.  He needed to go look for the card.  He disappeared.  We later flagged him down, asking about it, and he mumbled about not being able to find it. Oh, it gets better.  Neither the waiter nor manager made any effort to make our experience any better--other than telling us there was a number we could call.  Even then, we had to tell the manager to actually go ahead and write that number down for us.  It might have been helpful for the manager, instead, to do *anything* proactive--anything from proactively bringing the number to us...to calling the number for us...to discounting the cost of the meal...especially given the consistently incompetent service.   The first sign of trouble was minor enough, and I didn't mind, but most places have a fit when the patron does the waiter's job for him:  I went to the bar to pick up my beer.  It was clear the waiter would not get around to it any time soon, and I was in no mood for waiting patiently to be served a beer gone flat. But wait, there's more:  The waiter demonstrated a complete lack of ability to comprehend my companion's order for a vanilla malt with double the malt.  Someone else came to the table to ask us what we really wanted, beginning with a request for confirmation that we wanted two vanilla malts, which we did not.  She understood the corrected request without difficulty and filled the order quickly.  Long story short, the original waiter failed point after point after point to deliver what we requested, let alone in a timely fashion.  My companion was fit to be tied over losing the card, and the waiter turned into a ghost. This was one of the worst restaurant experiences of my life, and I've had a lifetime of experiences with which to make this comparison.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-raleigh?start=40
Ryan B.,"Durham, NC",302,144,36,2.0,4/27/2015,The service here is the pits... The food is typical of all other red robins and have the best fries around.

The draft beer options are limited and no locals here.  If the food wasn't delicious this place would get 1/2 a star. Waited over 5 minutes for a water refill.

Matt C.,"Raleigh, NC",4,105,,1.0,12/9/2014,"Let me start with the positives about my experience: We were greeted and seated quickly, probably because the place was 3/4 empty. .....that's it for the positives. Now for the negatives:  Reader's Digest version: Absolutely pathetic, underwhelming, insufficient, unsatisfactory, and inadequate in every phase of service and dining.  Long version : Despite being almost empty the server took 10 minutes to get to the table and get our order. Then brought out the drinks 10 minutes later with the appetizer (wings) we ordered.  (Hint- don't get the wings you'll be really disappointed if you like wings. It looks like they got the leftovers some the small, weak, anorexic chickens) I had to get up and go to a servers station and get napkins myself, because guess what?- the server didn't bring any and disappeared, again. Who doesn't give out napkins for wings? Maybe a cost savings thing. Silverware didn't make it the table the whole night, maybe the dishwasher was on strike or they figured another way to save money by not having any.   Then the entrees come out about 20 minutes later. Meanwhile, drinks have been sitting empty for a while. Manager comes by and asks if everything is ok as food comes out and keeps on walking, never saw him again. I would keep on walking as well if I was in charge of this gastro-fiasco. The burgers are a sad pathetic embarrassment for ""gourmet"", unless gourmet means ""overpriced, small piece of cheap tasteless meat with some toppings on it"".  There were probably 10 fries in the basket of fries, but they were in a fancy aluminum cylinder thing. Maybe the artistic fry holder is where the money for napkins and silverware went. Look at the pictures THEY have posted on Yelp. Count the number of fries- it is less than 12 in all the photos.  The edges of the bread was hard, like it was old. A couple of the 10 fries were not fully cooked. I liked Red Robin much better a few years ago when the menu was like Waffle House, a laminated double sided piece of paper and reasonably good burgers. The ""gourmet burgers"" business model is an EPIC FAIL. Management needs to re-think that concept, starting at this location. Despite her disappearing act most of the night, the server did promptly bring out the bill.  I could go on, but why waste my time and yours? The single star says it all. Bottom line is: go to Wendy's. Get a double. It will be cheaper and more of a ""gourmet"" burger than this was, you get your own napkins, eating utensils, and refill your own drinks and their service couldn't be any worse!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-raleigh?start=40
Lori D.,"Durham, NC",8,30,1,2.0,11/13/2014,First time at this location. We went in on a Wednesday evening and the restaurant was about half full. We asked for a booth and they sat us in the bar.  It was several minutes before anyone acknowledged us. We got our food but the extras we asked for didn't come so we had to wait. We had to wait for silverware and napkins. She refilled Hubby's Dr pepper with root beer. We waited ten more minutes before a different waitress asked if everything was okay. We told her the problem and waited another five minutes for our waitress to bring another soda. And she didn't apologize! I had a burger with bottomless fries and after I was done and put my napkin and knife on my empty plate she asks if I want more fries.  Here's the kicker. Rev Barber/NAACP was also dining two tables away. He came in way after us. He had two servers helping his party of four...I mean all over them.

Jeff L.,"Raleigh, NC",1,39,29,1.0,12/1/2014,"Went here last night.  Party of 12.  Celebrating 2 birthdays and a new baby announcement. Service was underwhelming. Taking the drink order was late, taking the food order was late, food arrival was late and 3 of 12 orders were wrong.  Drinks were always dry.  At one point I got up and walked to the bar to get a refill on my soda. I wouldn't specifically say the waitress was bad.  But I did comment to her that it was obvious the lousy way the short order line was managed as well as the un-hurried attempts at putting the food up. She did comment ""you have no idea"". The manager made no appologies and was busy at several other tables trying to implement damage control. Several tables around us were very obviously experiencing the same low level of service. It must be a routine issue there, as the management speech I got sounded very rehersed.  We did get comp'd 3 desserts that we didn't order and 1 meal that I finally got after everyone else was done eating. After spending over $90 and the rest of our party well over $120.00 and no real releif, I realized this place has taken a sharp down turn in thier approach to service.  Just looking at the other local area RR reviews, doesn't instill confidence that it's ""just this location"". All I can advise is, service is a reflection of management.  McDonalds has better service for far less.  Food quality is mutual.  Although RR has a unique spin on the burger experience, the lack of service doesn't equate to good value.  I've written off AppleBee's and Johnny Carrino's in this area.  I don't think my expectations are too high.  I simply think the approach to service has plumetted so low, the management staff is undertrained and the experience just winds up being a blunder.  If you go on the spur of the moment and happen to wind up here on Yelp for a sanity check... your experience may differ.  But I doubt it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-raleigh?start=40

He also asked if we wanted any refills on fries and if we wanted dessert. My only problem was that they didn't have any seafood which put a damper on one of us but the waiter recommended a salad with not only sound good but also when it came to the table it tastes very well so he was the saving grace.

The food was, at best, flavorless.  The burger was cooked beyond well, even though I asked for a medium cook. I suspect a medium cook is not possible as the burgers appeared to be pre-made, packaged, and likely frozen.  The burger lacked even a modicum of flavor. The fries were very ho-hum, lacking anything even approximating crispness. Apparently endless fries means one small serving as that is all I was offered.

My Wife ordered a mixed drink, one of there supposed signature beverages from the bar. When she got it, it was undrinkable. I mean it tasted horrible. There's no way they would make a drink like that on purpose. We got someone to bring out some pineapple juice to dilute it with and make it less bitter.  She was a trooper and sipped on it. Only because no one cared enough to check back... she had no choice. The food was OK Took forever to get anything. The other thing that pissed me off was that she just came and dropped the plates on the table and said enjoy! She never came back to make sure the food was as expected or even edible for that matter.

An overstaffed kitchen and understaffed floor mixed with a hostess who was texting and not once looked at us until I had to talk to her first started what was soon to be one of the worst dining experiences of my life. My dad and I were seated in the back of the restaurants in a group of about 4 occupied tables. A large party had been there previously and the long table was covered with glasses, dishes napkins and garbage, as were three other surrounding tables. The entire time we were there, one of them got cleaned. ONE. Managers walked by it and didn't give it a second glance. After painfully ordering food from the most anti-social waitress in history, we received our food that was lackluster of any flavor other than what I assume cardboard wrapped in bacon tastes like. I was asked if I wanted another lemonade once the entire hour and when I got my refill, it was a diet coke....... After this entire experience, the waitress had the ovaries to ask me to fill out a customer satisfaction survey located in my ticket wallet which I did her the favor of not filling out. Horrible experience and I will NEVER go back to this location. If the managers and employees don't care, neither do i",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-raleigh?start=80

Ken H.,"Durham, NC",0,65,,3.0,4/11/2016,"We've been to Red Robin a bunch of times. The food has always been excellent, though they need to learn how to make a root beer float that isn't 90% foam. I really like that they have bottomless fries, healthy alternatives, and beverages beyond soda. I think that's ultimately what draws me to the place. The service has always been excellent, I've never had a complaint about it. The only complaints I do have are price (you can shell out some serious money for a burger here, and some of their apps are grossly overpriced) and cleanliness. They need to put a LOT more effort into keeping the place clean. Every time I'm there, the whole restaurant is littered with napkins, crayons, even menus. The bathroom cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired as well.  Overall, it's a nice, casual place close to us for an impromptu meal when we're too busy to cook.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-raleigh?start=60
Joanna S.,"Morrisville, NC",0,4,,1.0,5/13/2017,Visited this location tonight with my children. We were seated in the bar area. Our waitress was the bartender. After our order was taken my son's salad came out first. We had no silverware so I asked the person who brought the food for a set. 10 mins later nothing. Finally I had to go to the bar to ask the bartender for a fork. It took so long because they were all in the dishwasher!?!?!! We then got our food my son having ordered a burger in a basket. When helping him get settled I noticed there was a French fry with ketchup in the basket under his food. The manager did come over and of course confirm how gross this was and thanked me for bringing it to his attention. I was disappointed by the lack of attention from the server. I understand that she may have been busy making drinks so I blame the management expecting a bartender to appropriately attend to guests. I was also surprised to see my son's meal wasn't removed from our bill. Disappointed in both the service and cleanliness of this location.

Brooke N.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",6,2,,1.0,8/24/2015,"I am honestly not a picky critic when it comes to servers or bartenders for I am in the service industry myself. I know that sometimes things happen that the server or bartender can not control. There are also just miserable people out there that are impossible to please.  Tonight was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant.  We arrived at 6:45 and stood at the door for about ten minutes before we were greeted by a hostesses. The only reason I knew what time we arrived is because we stood there for so long we checked our phones to see if it was the busy dinner rush and maybe that's why there was no one to greet us. My boyfriend and I were then told it would be a ten minute wait. After waiting 25 minutes our name was finally called.  Upon sitting down we were promptly greeted by our blonde server Briana who took our drink order, then shortly after our food order. We never saw her at our table again after that. It took a good thirty minutes for our food to come out which the manager delivered to our table. Briana never came back to check to see if everything came out alright. My sweet potato fries were super cold. Not even luke warm - seemed like they had been sitting out for a good while. Our ketchup bottle was empty on the table and I was in need of some extra BBQ sauce. We were sitting right next to the food line so we could see our server but she just kept walking right past us. It was probably 7 or 8 minutes I waited until I finally just got up myself and walked to the line to request some ketchup, BBQ sauce, and fresh fries. A DIFFERENT server then came over and brought me everything I needed. The service manager (whose name I can't remember) came over to apologize for the cold fries. He then said Briana was busy helping HIM get food out and that is why she was no where to be found. He wasn't very customer friendly, just seemed more like excuses coming from him. He then tried to make small talk with me as managers usually do to try to take my mind off the frustrations.  We made it half way through our meal (mine was delicious but my boyfriends burger was way over cooked) without ever having Briana come back to our table. She would walk right by; we would see her...but she wouldn't come over. We were soon out of tea. We put both of our empty glasses on the edge of the table and at this point we just stared at her in hopes she would come over. Finally my boyfriend flagged her down and asked if we could have more tea. She then brings over one glass of tea and sits it in front of him next to my empty glass and walks away. We both then laughed because the service was just so terrible it was comical. He then gave me his tea and we waited another ten minutes to ask ANOTHER server for one more glass of tea.  Side note, this entire time we were surrounded by her dirty tables. Every single table next to us was dirty and was never cleaned off the entire time we sat there until we walked out.  No apology from Briana, no emotion was ever shown on her face as she brought over our check. We pre-bussed our own table and neatly laid everything over to the edge of the table. She never came over to take the plates away. We gave her our credit card and watched her drag around the food line aimlessly as if she had no sense of urgency. She brought back our receipts in the check presenter and walks away - and OF COURSE no pen!!!! I honestly just grabbed the closest server and begged for a pen because we wanted to get the heck out of there. The service was honestly terrible. Not only did our service suck but she was waiting on a table nearby and we could hear them complaining to her  about different things she was not doing (ie: wrong cheese on their burger, no refills, etc.)  Me and my boyfriend both being bartenders at a local restaurant we were examining the situation and we came to the conclusion that maybe Briana was in training but had no trainer with her. The credit card receipt that we received back had a different servers name on it (Taylor) leaving us under the impression she was training under Taylor's name.  ****Note to Taylor, I wouldn't trust Briana with making your tips for the night because the service was way less than mediocre.***** You should of been overseeing her.  Honestly, my boyfriend and I agreed to never go back. Which is sad because the food was good enough to go back but the service was just ridiculous.  We did leave a good tip :) we both agreed that it was pretty much impossible to leave a bad tip considering we both work the same job as her and bad tips are the pits. She DESERVED no tip - if I'm being honest. She did absolutely nothing for us but provide a few laughs in regards to the train wreck service she was providing.  Save yourself and choose somewhere else for dinner!!! Or lunch, for that matter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-raleigh?start=60
Scott A.,"Raleigh, NC",3,11,,2.0,9/6/2014,"A substandard burger with service to match.  Several years ago I really loved this place - I swear they had one of the best burgers out there. I probably would have given it 4 stars, but so much has changed.    This evening we went to give them another try, the burgers were not great, and even the other items we ordered off the menu just felt like cheap bar food.  Once seated we managed to get an appetizer ordered (some pretzel bits that were good), and then the server disappeared to the abyss.  Finally after the drinks and the appetizer were distant memories,  we decided to go find a manger who in all sincerity did not seem to know what to do.  Our server arrived (by luck) about 3 mins later and we finally got our order placed.   I appreciate their desire for a modern feel - Something about the design of the restaurant tuns it into an echo chamber.  If there are 50 people in the dining room it sounds like there are 100.  Not entirely surprising as its an open ceiling, hard floors, etc.  The sound simply has nowhere to go.  If you like a loud atmosphere its great, but we've found it difficult to carry a conversation in there.  The food was less than impressive.  At our table I feel like we got a good sampling of the menu - A salad, some wings, burgers, etc. Don't get me wrong, its not all bad.  The good news is the steak fires are bottomless which is great because if you decide you just don't want to finish your entree you can fill up on fries (perhaps that is their design).  We did not get to partake in the bottomless fries as our server was pretty much no where to be found.  I'm not saying the food was not edible, but there are just so many other far superior options for the same price or less.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-raleigh?start=60

Rhoda G.,"Raleigh, NC",420,588,82,4.0,10/29/2015,"It's been years since I have been to a Red Robin and I was pleasantly surprised. On each table, they had a touch screen tablet where you can order your food. However, when you first order, you can only use the tablet for appetizers and put in your main course and drinks with your waiter/waitress. If we wanted something from our waitress, then you press the button on the screen and a red light will begin flashing. Our waitress was pretty fast so I was pleased with their service. For food, I ordered short stack order of their famous onion tower because I love onion rings. I made sure to get them extra crispy. Then I got the whiskey river bbq burger with their endless steak fries. I didn't take advantage of the endless fries since I was full with my appetizer, but I thought it was a good deal. The burger itself was a decent size and I liked it. Not the best burger I ever had, but decent.

Terry W.,"Pittsboro, NC",86,711,1995,5.0,3/23/2011,"OK, My son asked my wife and I if we wanted to go out for dinner. We usually watch Baby Grace and they go out to dinner , but we were all going out together. They wanted to go to a place that was loud, well had some noise. My previous experience with Red Robin's is that they had lots of kids there, catered to families and had a loud noise level. You ask why take a 6 mo old to a loud place. Ha, if she starts to cry she will just blend in with all the other noise. No one will be giving us dirty looks like, ""shut that baby up"".  It was a Saturday evening just before twilight, the weather was excellent and warm. We decided to sit on the patio. The place was packed and I figured it will be more than a 15 min wait. I was wrong, they called out names in 8 min. I always time them. Looking over at Baby Grace, she was sound asleep. How can she sleep in all this noise. She slept for 1/2 hour.  The server was excellent and so was the food. I had a Turkey Burger and enjoyed it. My wife had the California Sandwich and it was delicious. The experience was excellent and if you have children, this is always a fun place.  Grace did wake up with a few little peeps, then she looked around until we were finished. She was perfect and we enjoyed our meal.  Oh, one more thing, they must be dog friendly on the patio.

Jon O.,"Raleigh, NC",67,549,210,3.0,11/4/2015,"Had my first Red Robin experience the other night. Being my first visit I would call It a momentous occasion....Anyways, we sat in the bar area at a High Top and the waitress came by to go over the menu and introduce us to ""robin"" who was the on-table touchpad device similar to a kindle that allows you to order everything except your main course and even pay for your tab. It's kind of a neat idea since a lot of the drudgery of ordering is easy as pushing buttons on a screen and this simplifies the process. The we ordered a couple apps (chips and dip, onion rings) and they were pretty good. I had a burger for my meal and it was pretty good too. The food overall was....pretty good, but not amazing. The price point for this place seems to be just around 12$ for a burger which is a little steep but you do get bottomless fries with that which is a plus. The only problem I had with this location is that the table and about everything in the area we sat at was kinda sticky like it hadn't been properly cleaned in a while. Maybe it was also the decor setting the mood but the feel was just sort of grimy all over imo.

Tracie M.,"Durham, NC",0,1,,1.0,11/17/2015,"So....this has to be the worst red robin experience yet (there have been a few)! Where do I start? First let me say that we both work in the industry so we are overly aware of what is going on when we go out to eat!  First we walked in at 4:10 we waited 5 min to be seated, while there were what appeared to be two managers sitting at the very first table. A server with hands full of plates greeted us and told us she would be right back. She went to the managers at the front table and asked for some help. The manager said she had seen us but thought we had already been helped. We went to the back and as she lead us to the table there was ketchup all over the floor so we reversed to a table we had just passed.  We sat down and waited another 5 min to be greeted by our server. My daughter ordered a Sprite and we ordered a bottled beer and a tall draft. After quite a few min she returned to our table saying she only wanted to bring it all at the same time. She placed the bottle down on the table and then dropped the rest of the drinks on my six year old daughter. Broke the glass in to pieces that landed all in my lap. She looked stunned and didn't get any napkins. I took my daughter to the bathroom to dry off and when I returned he was still waiting for her to come back and clean up. She asked if we wanted to stay at the same table, we moved ourselves. We knew what we wanted because I was looking in the car cause we were on a time restriction. She came back and said she didn't know where the bartender was to replace the beer she had spilt. We gave her our order and then kept on waiting. We wanted to play games because we had already paid at the first table. You can only play once they activated your table. So we know she hadn't put in our food or transferred out table number yet.  Appetizers came out. Small onion tower and clam chowder. Dropped and ran. When she finally came back he pointed out that the soup was to come with bread...she blamed it on the kitchen and then brought the bread 15 min later after he was done with the soup. The manager came to apologize and said he would take care of the beer and the onion rings (but not the soup that was missing the bread). Later he returned with our food. We had ordered a few sauces to try out with our meal. They didn't come out so we let her know and again she blamed it on the kitchen. Brought our sauces out and ran again.  I ordered another beer because my nerves were shot at this point. I would have just drank water, but that requires ever being brought the water. My boyfriend was facing the bar and said it had been sitting there forever. The bar tender brought the beer and didn't ask if she should get another for him since it was completely empty. Server came back to see if everything was ok. But he had to step out he was so frustrated. I asked for the check and a box. About 5 min later she returned to the table with the check but no box. So I asked again. She came back and sorta plopped it on the table. We paid and got out as soon as we could because I had to get home to change my daughter into something that didn't smell like beer to get where we needed to be at 6! No one seemed to be happy to be there. Service was horrible. Food wasn't bad at all so thumbs up to the kitchen. Red robin needs to think of retraining the entire staff.

Vonda C.,"Rocky Mount, NC",6,18,,1.0,4/10/2016,"Came in after 3p, about 3 other patrons in the restaurant.  Get ignored while waiting to be greeted, so I go to the restroom and come out and sit myself at the bar.  (I did want a small table). Sweet Hayley, takes my order, I'm never offered water, I finished my ice cream drink way before the food arrives - just like I told her I would.  (thirsty) I order cornmeal bun, that had to be returned bc it came on regular seeded bun, no big deal - ""I think"" -  since noticed immediately and the runner said good you haven't touched it, I ordered campfire sauce, that didn't come with the order.  It came when I was down to about 4 fries left.   They delivered the large container of dip, never offered a refill of fries or the first water, but at the same time some of the staff was taking turns sampling the beer.  I said I sure would like some more fries.  She said no problem.  The ball was dropped all over the place in the line of giving 1/2 way decent customer service at a very slow time.  Please improve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-raleigh?start=100

That being said, there's always something on the menu for everyone, from meat eaters to vegetarians. Burgers can be custom ordered, and they offer healthy side options (even steamed broccoli) to the bottomless steak fries (which are yummy!).

Amanda D.,"Raleigh, NC",40,82,5,4.0,4/18/2014,"Went to Red Robin today for lunch with a group of coworkers.  Everyone else ordered burgers and I chose the southwestern salad with grilled chicken.  Waitress was extremely friendly and brought out baskets of fries with sauce for us to munch on while we waited for our food.  Everyone enjoyed The food and I would order my salad again - the ranch dressing was homemade which I am a stickler for.  Waitress even offered us drinks to go which was super nice..  Good service for sure, we will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-raleigh?start=100
Gary S.,"Edenton, NC",0,7,,1.0,12/10/2014,I ordered the PRIME RIB DIP and it didn't look anything like what is on the online menu. Very skimpy on the meat. Not wanting to make a scene at the time since it was a birthday party for my 4 year old grandson I sent in a comment via their site and also sent a message on Facebook. They refuse to talk to me. Looking back I should taken a picture of the sandwich and posted it on Facebook. Why is it so hard to want to discuss a problem. You don't lose a customer and you spread the word they care and likely drive more business there way,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-raleigh?start=100
MSKK E.,"Raleigh, NC",0,6,,4.0,8/15/2011,"If you are looking for quiet and cozy I'd find another place. This place is busy busy, it is loud and it's also a hot birthday spot so be prepared to hear the lovely staff sing Happy Birthday at least two times while visiting :) However, if you are searching for good food especially in the form of a sandwich and the possible need for a ToGo box you found the right place. We arrived and were seated promptly. Our server was great. She quickly got our drinks and our order. It was a minimal wait until food arrived. Another plus was that the manager stopped by right quick to see how we were doing. From what I heard the Bacon Cheeseburger that was ordered was ""REALLY REALLY good"" and was cooked to a perfect medium well.   Consumed by yours truly was California Chicken Sandwich with sweet potato fries. The only issues I had was that the sandwich was so huge that the way they placed the sandwich in the tray the bottom got soggy...sorry but soggy bread = ick and  the sweet potato fries came out a little on the cool side. That aside the chicken was flavorful and juicy and the fries were rather tasty! I can't wait to try out other items on the menu as there are plenty or items to choose from!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-raleigh?start=100

Kirby R.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,30,7,2.0,7/19/2014,"Food was just so-so and the service was a little worse. My chicken salad didn't contain much chicken and we probably had four or five different people serve our table, none of them seemed coordinated I might add. We had several appetizers that had bottomless chips that took way too long to get refilled and my drink glass remained empty most of the time.

Michael H.,"Baton Rouge, LA",59,577,89,3.0,10/29/2010,"The food is OK, the adult-looking non-alcoholic drinks are sugary sweet and the atmosphere generally includes the din of noisy kids doing whatever noisy kids do.

Psalm S.,"Raleigh, NC",74,183,39,3.0,4/5/2010,"The burgers are good. Really good. Great milkshakes and ""bottomless"" fries, which are kind of a joke because, really, who can eat that many fries? But, still, the idea is cool. You can even order a burger with a fried egg on top. They do have other things besides beef burgers, or just burgers in general--salads, wraps, soup, and the strawberry lemonade is tasty. It's obviously very kid/family-friendly, which is great, but it can seem kind of like a giant cafeteria when it's full. It can be difficult to hear your dining partner, but then again, when your face is full of meaty goodness, it's a moot point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-raleigh?start=100

Mal O.,"Cary, NC",0,21,,1.0,3/28/2012,"I hate this entire chain.  It is always noisy, always overcrowded, and more often than not both the food and the service suck. The last THREE times I have been there, I have had to send my entree back: one chicken sandwich doused in so much pesto that the bun was mush, one burger charred so black I actually had to clean soot off of my teeth, and a salad that was about 60% brown, wilted lettuce.  I have friends that like this place for some reason-- they're into the bottomless fries, though the service is always so slow that nobody ever actually gets seconds. Beverages refills are a constant headache, and in my experience are NEVER filled unless you've completely emptied your glass and have asked the server for refills twice.  Also: I know it's ""family friendly,"" but that SHOULD NOT mean that your children are allowed to run screaming through the restaurant. Get a clue, parents.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-raleigh?start=100
Chad P.,"Raleigh, NC",7,61,18,3.0,11/28/2011,"Went here because it was near our parking spot during Black Friday weekend, and my friend wanted a burger. Typical chain, gimmick, restaurant, but for convenience sake it gets the job done. Service was good, but annoying. Our server seemed to be very hyper, loud, and reading a script. Also did the usual bug you every second, interrupting conversation, UNTIL, you are ready for the check and suddenly gets missing game. Burgers were good, but avoid the 79 cent sweet potato fries upgrade, they taste like the frozen ones from the grocery store, but overcooked. If you want to pay for a 9 dollar and up burger, I would suggest Tribeca Tavern Falls Of The Neuse location. Specializes in burgers, but better. Still think 5 guys, and Char-grill have the best burgers in town but a lot cheaper.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-raleigh?start=100
Braxton M.,"Greensboro, NC",22,52,21,4.0,8/31/2012,"Let me just start this by saying that my party and I rolled in at about 9:45. They close at 10. We received the same level of service as if we had come in at 5 in the afternoon. It was great! They have appetizer specials after 8 pm. We saved about 5 bucks. Ordered the hummus, mozzarella sticks, wings, and the fries and onion straws. It came with a bunch of different sauces, but the one that stuck out was the bacon aioli. Most amazing blend of flavors ever! Freckled lemonade kind of fell flat. It was tart with lots of strawberries, but it was missing the sweet aspect.
